One night while watching the TV, heard a loud pop and smell something burning inside the TV (no smoke), and then picture goes; only lines (vert. & horzontal). Called into Sharp customer service and they tell me it' not covered under their liability warranty. They offered me a 20% promotional code to buy a another TV from their Sharp site. I explained serval times that nothing has hit or touched the screen panel (no outside damage anywhere), and they said its the best they can do. STAY AWAY, you will do better with a different brand than Sharp.", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good but not perfect.", "Author": "Shyam Sunder Indrakanti", "ReviewID": "RLJISIUO93NER", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Firstly I don't know what the problem the other reviewer had but my PS3 hooked up and ran fine in 1080p via the HDMI, my Xbox 360 runs 1080p via VGA. The TV is great and has really vibrant colors but it isn't perfect by any means. It certainly wasn't worth the 1200 I paid for it, but it wasn't too bad. If you can snag one for under 800 this is a GREAT buy and the video quality is amazing. If you are looking mainly for movies, please get a plasma TV since this isn't that good for movies (Black levels lacking). I have the 47\" I am not commenting on the 42\" version since I don't own it and haven't used it.", "Date": "March 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV Owned for Three Years", "Author": "Rick S", "ReviewID": "R3FDPJKN9JFBLQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV off Dell some time ago for $799 and I love it.  I've never had an issue and it's a great value.  The only thing I dislike is the thickness of the TV, but that comes with buying a LCD over LED.", "Date": "June 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fixed audio output problem", "Author": "sggall \"Susan\"", "ReviewID": "R1QJSXZ55BU0YT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Since these tv's do not have the greatest sound, I just bought and tried to hook-up a sound bar . . . . here's what I learned the hard way: audio/digital output does not work on any of the HDMI inputs, but will work just fine on the rest of them, so don't get discouraged. I called both Sharp and Vizio several times (which was quite a journey in itself): Vizio thought the sound bar was messed up, Sharp tried the obvious but should have been able to tell me that this tv model's audio output is not connected to the HDMI inputs (goofy!!). At first I agreed with Vizio, but after I hooked the sound bar up to my computer (on a lark) and discovered that indeed it did work I realized that it was a Sharp tv problem. Next I hooked the tv's audio output to my stereo's input and discovered the problem with the hdmi input vs. the rest of them. In desperation, I pulled my components out of the cabinet and started checking their output and viola, I hooked the dvr directly to the sound bar and it works just fine (and it is nice to listen to Pandora without the tv on!). Everything else that is attached to the other tv inputs will work through the audio output on it; the only drawback is you have to change the source on the sound bar depending on what you are watching/listening to. Personally, I think that Sharp should have divulged this strange idiosyncrasy, it would have saved a lot of time and trouble (and frustration), but perhaps they might have had to sell them for even less.", "Date": "May 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Superb tv, awesome price", "Author": "elpetero", "ReviewID": "R2E5IV1NG794JC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tv set is perfect. I own it for over a year now. 47 inch, 1080p, 120hz, $799.99, this was a steal. Perfect pictrues, good options, it is way better than my 1080p vizio. There is no visiual difference between this Sharp and Panasonic that I also own, however Panasonic cost twice as much. Speakers on this model should be more powerful, however since most people have sound systems installed, it does not matter.", "Date": "February 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Picture, Terrible Sound", "Author": "Charles", "ReviewID": "R320ORDDWL1OCV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The picture is impressive and I have no complaints about it at all.  Stunning detail.  The audio, however, from the built-in speakers is incredibly bad.  If you are someone who owns or appreciates higher-end audio products, do not buy this TV unless you have something to plug the audio into.  Built-in speakers are literally so bad they will leave you in disbelief.", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great at Specific Price Points", "Author": "JR", "ReviewID": "R2JJ6N850JIEVY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "To put this review in perspective, I got this TV for $699 plus $40 shipping.  At this price, the value is exceptional.1.  For a ~$700 TV, the picture is excellent.  The clarity and colors are excellent.  On certain movies, there is a 3-D effect which never ceases to amaze me.  It's not the Avatar type of 3-D, but a more modest but still impressive 3-D/motion effect.  I have seen the new LED TVs and they are noticeably richer in color intensity but they are also at least twice the price.  I also wasn't able to adjust the color settings in the store so the comparison is not complete.  I have my TV set to Sport or Vivid and the color intensity is closer to an LED TV.  So maybe stores are not quite comparing apples to apples when demonstrating TV's next to each other.2.  As mentioned by other reviews, the RCA audio outputs do not work when the HDMI cable inputs are used.  This is annoying and poor design/manufacturing decision.3.  The built in speakers are some of the worst I have heard on an expensive TV.  Most 27\" tube TV's have better sound than this one.4.  The key saving sound feature that stopped me from returning the TV because of sound, was the headphone jack.  I connected a good quality powered computer speakers w/woofer system into the headphone jack and now the sound is excellent for everyday use and I don't have to mess with my separate stereo component system.5.  Used as a computer monitor, the quality of the picture is excellent and works well with my Dell computer. When the HDMI outputs of my computer are used, there is a very noticeable overscan where icons on the extreme edge of the desktop screen are almost completely cut off.6.  Overall, the picture is so excellent, I am finding myself watching older movies again in HD.  It's like watching a different movie and I am catching detail I have missed even in theaters.", "Date": "May 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Do not buy this!", "Author": "eggpulusu", "ReviewID": "R3S9F9M95U74BI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Video quality is poor.Audio is bad.

One word of advise, if you're trying to set a cod for this tv on some universal remote, and none of the Sharp works, try LG codes.

Experienced problem after problem both during and after warranty.  2 HDMI ports stopped working, the main board went out; power supply went out.  Just problem after problem.  To top it off; most of the external ports are right in line with the mounting holes.  So if you decided to mount the TV, the mounting hardware will block most of your external ports from being used.  An absolute idiot designed this TV.  You will have to see it to believe it. Research and find photos of the rear of the TV before you buy. One thing is for sure, if you buy this TV, you may as well throw your money in the trash.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Does not output SPDIF from HDMI or Component source", "Author": "S. Richard", "ReviewID": "R3EGB6N1SX654Y", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Using HDMI input, the only audio output choices the built-in speakers or HDMI output to your receiver.  Using Component input, the only audio output choices are the built-in speakers or analog RCA jacks.  There is NO WAY to use HDMI or Component as the input and output to the SPDIF (digital) audio.  According to Sharp's technical support, there is no way around this limitation.  So, if you have three (or more) HD sources (I have a TiVo HD, Blu-Ray player, & Wii) and your receiver doesn't have HDMI inputs, you'll have to choose which two to hook up to the Component inputs (so they can output to your surround sound receiver) and which one(s) to hook up the the HDMI inputs (that will only output to the built-in speakers).", "Date": "April 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "False Advertising: Not 1080p", "Author": "JeremyLC", "ReviewID": "R3MGVPEDXGLMZZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This entire line of TV's is falsely advertised by Sharp.  The TV cannot properly display 1080p from an HDMI input.  It will force its image scaling and stretch the image so it is too large to fit on the screen, causing all 4 edges to be cut off the display.  This is unacceptable and it is unethical for the TV to be advertised as a 1080p display.I have encountered this problem on the LC-42SB45UT as well as the LC-47SB57UT, using either a PC or a Playstation 3 connected via HDMI.
