Lowry \"A Callow Sage\"", "ReviewID": "RIUSOMKKX3MT3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I picked this tv up about a month ago, and thus far have very few qualms with it.  It's stylish design has earned a few compliments from people, and fits perfectly atop the dresser in my room.  I will say that when I hooked up non-digital cable, there were strange black shadowy lines.  This could be due to having a low-quality coaxial cable though.  Once I hooked up a digital cable box to the tv, the lines vanished.This tv has a wide variety of inputs as well; I use it to watch movies from my laptop with excellent results, and the HD looked amazing when I hooked an HD cable box up to it.The problems:  There are only two things that I could find wrong with this tv.  The first is the sound.  When using the speakers in the tv, it does have a very tinny, flat sound.  There are no rca audio outs, but I hooked up a headphone stereo cable to the headphone jack, and plugged it into my computer surround sound.  Another easy solution would be to pick up a 30 dollar logitech speaker system.  When connected to another system, the sound is great.  Also, the tv has no program codes for the universal remote supplied by my cable company.  A small problem, but worht noting.All in all, I am very pleased with the purchase of this tv.", "Date": "September 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "DOA After 23 months", "Author": "em \"miss\"", "ReviewID": "R1Z6EG9W970HN6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this tv on nov 26 2006. We are getting a white screen. For a $319.00 tv you would think the tv would last more then 23 months. Called the polariod company they told us that it is the video card in the tv. They are willing to sell us other one for $155.00 plus pay to ship to broken one back to them. I will not be buying anymore polariod products when I fell that they are not willing to stand by their products and not telling customers that there is a problems with the video cards in these tvs.", "Date": "September 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Polaroid TV = Polaroid TV", "Author": "A.

This TV is wonderful. Why get this one instead of a Sony or Panasonic? Because it is cheaper! And it is worth it. The picture on the TV is obviously not as good as Sony, but it is very, very close. It has a much higher resolution than most other TV's, including many Sony. I would say the only downside to this TV is the sound, while the speakers are quite good, they have a low bass potential, but after testing a few other TV's in the local store, I found that it was a common problem.

When I searched for a new 19\" TV to put in a small bedroom, I decided to go with Polaroid again.  Picture quality is great.

Rupy", "ReviewID": "R2GK0E7DE3QXDT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Nice TV while it worked. Unfortunately, if you have one, yours will likely quit in the same way mine did after 2.5 years: You'll lose picture, but still have sound. My local repairman told me that, even if he could get the parts (they are simply unavailable from any supplier), the cost would be greater than the cost of a new name-brand TV. (He based that statement on his knowledge of the prices of similar parts for other brands he services.) Also, based on troubleshooting info I found online, I took it apart to see if there might be any bad capacitors, but they all looked good (that is, not bulging or leaking like electrolytics do when they fail). I treated my TV really well, never overheated it, and always powered it through a surge suppressor, and it still died. Serves me right for picking a TV based on its picture quality.

I haven't had many of the large failing issues others seem to have but that doesn't mean it has been smooth sailing. First off the tv has this rolling distortion line that messes with dvds and my xbox. Also during dvd playback the black level fluctuates and is inconsistent. Lastly, and most annoyingly, my tv will not auto search any channels,it can find the channel if you manually input it into the remote but forget channel surfing.

I changed channels and it was still black. I then turned off the television, waited a few seconds and then turned it back on. A few minutes later it did it again. I repeated the steps noted and it kept happening. I unplugged the unit and then put it back, and again after a very few minutes it went black but the sound remains. I checked all the cables and this continues to happen. I turned off the television and unplugged it for an hour. The picture stayed on for about 45 minutes and the problem returned.

When I pop in a DVD, the sound drops. I have to turn it high, and sometimes it's still not enough.I am disappointed that it died just after, actually within, three years. Very disappointed.It started by just flickering between all 5 inputs on its own, as if a phantom took hold of my remote and kept hitting the input button. Then one day, it just didn't turn on, and that's where I am now.I called Polaroid, and with no extended warranty, they offered to give me a refurbished unit for $175, and I'd have to ship my old unit back on my dime. Dissatisfied. A TV repair place knows exactly what the problem is, and quote at least $20 to fix.I was very happy with it until it died. I am careful with electronic devices. All items that came with the unit are perfectly in tact, including the box, and packaging.I hope that they no longer sell this model. Very disappointed.
