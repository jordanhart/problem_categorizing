This philips seemed to be a great value for the price and the reviews were good. Shortly after receiving and testing both new tvs from amazon I began to question my sanity. I heard high pitched sounds whenever either tv was turned on. The sound stayed even when muted and after disconnected from any other device. The only way to stop it was to turn off the tv. Turned on again the 'mosquito on steroids' sound would be back. Each time louder than before. It has gotten so distracting now that I actually had to dig out our old crt tubes again. This constant squealing just makes the new tvs absolute useless. I am really disappointed but this philips tv just does not seem to be as good as it appeared at first. I am however very thankful to the reviewer who had the same problem and posted about it. I worried that I MUST have been imagining things since nobody else talked about this sound issue. Btw. the picture quality was very nice.Update: We had actually bought 3 of these tvs at the same time. Only 2 had the sound problems. The 3rd tv is working wonderful from day one. No squeal or other issues.", "Date": "February 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "What a great TV for the price", "Author": "vtxdude \"ristorap\"", "ReviewID": "RA78CV76NLMKZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently rearranged my home office and have been looking for a small TV to put on my desk.  Like Bob mentioned I saw this on clearance at Target for 150.00.  I've only had it a couple of days but so far so good and HD channels look fantastic.  Absolutely perfect for what I wanted it for and a steal at Target..... and not that bad priced here.  Looking for a sub 200 dollar TV?

It is easy to install, better of-the-air reception and video than my OLD TV, and a great value.The audio is also good enough so you do not need external speakers/system.

Ultimately, the price was the main deciding factor and she went with the Philips.I had the TV shipped to my office and I just plugged in my Sony DVP-SR500H DVD player and started to watch Despicable Me.Set-up was nothing more than plugging everything in and answering a few questions that were on the screen when I turned the TV on.The movie plays very smooth, colors needed a bit of tuning - but weren't too far off and the clarity of this SD DVD is amazing.Later that afternoon I set the TV up and watched regular SD cable. The picture quality was above average considering the cable feed was not HD.Like most flat panel TV's the sound could be better, but it's perfectly fine. Any elderly person who is hard of hearing shouldn't have a problem with the sound on this TV. The sound is very clear and at not even half-way up, its a bit too loud for my 15'x15' office.Overall, this is a very nice little TV. For $150 how can you go wrong?Would definitely recommend to someone looking for a 19\" TV.", "Date": "January 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Small TV", "Author": "K. M.

The TV is light weight, and the perfect size for a dresser in a bedroom. The picture is very clear and high quality. The remote is easy to use and I'm very happy with my purchase. I love the TV.The TV was delivered quickly and the packaging was just like it would be if I bought it at the store. There were no additional boxes or crates. That was a bit surprising, but the TV was in perfect condition so the extra packaging did not seem to be necessary.", "Date": "December 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Really nice TV", "Author": "K. J. Troyer", "ReviewID": "R2E0FUIYCBCDQQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We bought this TV to have in our kitchen so when we are in there we can watch sports and the kids can watch cartoons. It is a very nice little tv, great picture quality, even without the HDMi cables. Easy to mount on a swivel arm wall mount- not too heavy that one person can't do it.My only complaint is the sound- and it has nothing to to with quality. The quality is fine, no negatives- but the volume has to be turned to nearly the highest numbers to be heard! When turned to 100% (all the way at top volume) it is a good level for cooking and still being able to hear. If I wanted it higher- there would be no way to do that! It is a good thing that I mostly watch sports while in the kitchen, and, to me, the volume doesn't really matter. I have given up trying to watch any shows that I have to actually hear the dialogue. I tried different settings (there is a doctor's office setting, which limits the volume even more!) but can't get the volume to be any more \"normal\". With the volume turned to around 25%- it is nearly mute.Otherwise, I really love this tv. THe volume is a minor inconvenience.", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "I wish I could keep this TV!", "Author": "Berry Blue", "ReviewID": "R2GUIKY3H2PU0V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The TV is great but it emits a high frequency tone that is REALLY annoying.

Rose", "ReviewID": "R3ANTEIXUPGYTX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "SquareTrade 3-Year Electronics Warranty ($125-150 Items)Every good comment about this TV is true of mine. I've only had it for about 24 hours, but so far it's great. I live in a retirement community where the sound carries terribly from one apartment to the next. I bought this little TV to set on a side table next to my recliner. I can keep the volume low enough that it doesn't disturb my neighbors or even use my iPod's earbuds if I want to turn it up.It took me 30 minutes to get it set up and most of that time was spent screwing the stand on the base of the TV. The picture is perfect. I did go back and tweak the color a little, manually. But I eventually got it just the way I wanted it. No problem connecting my DVD player or setting up cable.If there is a problem, it is that the picture is too big to be as close as I have it - 3-4ft. I could have easily used a 16 in. But this one is the best buy for the money I have no regrets. Picture and sound with cable are as good as I've ever seen.Kudos, as usual, to Amazon and UPS. I ordered the TV on Feb. 1. It got caught in the snow storm in Indiana - Shipped Feb. 5 with a delivery date of Feb. 9. I kept checking the tracking updates and watching the weather in the news. I was notified that delivery was delayed - but they evidently made up the time because it showed up on Feb. 9 as scheduled. It was nice to be able to check the progress each day on the tracking.I plan to buy the 3 year warranty from Square Trade for $20 from Amazon with the option to add a year making it 4 years for $10 more. I love this TV, but I'm not taking any chances.P.S. I've had mine for a month now and just want to say I've had absolutely no problems with it whatsoever.

It was a very good price for a small HDTV. I was a little worried about buying this TV, heard a lot of good and bad from other reviews!It came in a very large box for a 19\" tv, no origanal boxing (A little disapointing) but came with everything necesarry (tv, power cord, remote, and stand,).The TV worked great for its use, as a small HDTV for video gaming is bedroom. The HD graphics looked great with my Xbox 360, small but good for one person. The only proble I have is that the volume either doesnt work or is really low unless you turn it up all the way.

It replaced a Magnavox which died after only a year. It's only been a month but, so far it's looking pretty good. It was a breeze to set up: just plug in, hook up cable, hit channel setup, and begin watching. Picture is just fine, sound is good for a 12-year-old's bedroom. I used the included stand instead of wall-mounting. The price was good on Amazon, although I found it cheaper closer to Christmas in stores, of course, after I'd already bought it. The price was only about $10 cheaper, worth it to me to avoid the lines and to guarantee I got it. It actually got to me a day or two earlier than was listed as delivery date.

I don't have cable, so I needed the HD antenna I had for the old TV.  I connected my DVD player directly to the TV.  I connected my VCR through the DTV converter box.  They both work perfectly.  Haven't tried to record on the VCR yet.  I needed to get eHow directions to help me make my connections.  I have to adjust the antenna a lot between stations, but I think I will get better with that.

I don't have any problem with the sound, but I find that the picture quality is extremely disappointing. There are four different ways to adjust the picture settings and format, and I have tried (and tried) them all.The short story:I find that whatever picture settings I settle on for one program have to be changed for a different program or even for a different scene in the same program. Also, there seems to be an overall greenish/yellow cast to all pictures, regardless of settings.The long story:1. I've adjusted and readjusted my choices in the Settings Assistant -- a series of vertically split scenes where you choose whether the left or right side of the picture is more pleasing to you. The left side seems to favor greenish yellow, the right side reddish orange. The least worst choices were on the right side, but then all the reds are brilliant purple/orange (and still have the greenish cast). I've tried alternating my choices between the two sides, choosing equally, but that resulting picture is too green.2. I've done the same with Auto Picture, which is differentiated into Personal (own settings), Standard, Sports, Movie, and Game.3. Personal settings include Brightness, Contrast, Color, Tint, Sharpness, Temperature, which so far I've readjusted for every program I've watched. The Brightness setting (to adjust the dark areas) may be fine for one scene, but looks bleached-out for the next scene or program. Same with the Contrast setting (which adjusts light areas).4. The picture formats (aspect ratios) are also frustrating, with some leaving just a tiny picture in the middle of an already small screen. The best I've settled on is a Zoom format, which doesn't distort the image (16:9) and fills the screen, but cuts off a bit at the top and bottom.I've finally settled on the settings that allow me to have a not-too-unpleasant picture experience (a bit too dark for dark scenes, a bit too light for bright scenes) but I will say that I have never had a problem like this. I have a larger LG flatscreen where I adjusted all the settings once, about a year and a half ago when I got it. Same with all the old CRT tvs I've had over the years -- adjusted once at the beginning and that's it. For this tv I've been fiddling with the settings several times each evening, each program, for most of this week. Even a relatively inexpensive tv should not have this problem.
