I was a bit nervous about spending such a large amount of money with a retailer I knew nothing about but the transaction was perfect.  As for the TV.  I don't know much about the tech side but the picture quality is outstanding.  I did start out with the analog cable but upgraded to digital 1080p and found the money is well worth it.  The TV needs to be fed the high quality signal to perform at its best.", "Date": "June 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Bad Pixels no satisfaction from Sharp", "Author": "Joe H.", "ReviewID": "R3H6W974L1H48A", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased the Sharp LC52SE94U LCD HDTV through Amazon.  The actual seller was OneCall(Huppin's).  After 3 days 2 pixels went bad.  Contacted OneCall, they said it was a manufacturer's defect & they would not be able to help me. They gave me the number to Sharp customer service.  One interesting thing about the product, when I opened up the box it appeared that the LCD screen had been pulled out and replaced in the box.  The internal packaging surrounding the display appeared to have been removed and replaced.  When I mentioned this to the person at OneCall he stated that they did not open the product prior to shipping it to me.  When I received the product it was still sealed with two nylon straps each covered with the OneCall's labels to ensure it had not been opened during shipping. So, if it had been taken out of the box it was prior to being shipped to me by OneCall.Called Sharp and they had me take pictures of the problem and send the pictures to them via email.  I sent the pictures to Sharp and received this response via email:\"We have reviewed the pictures, and the unit is within our specifications.\"When I responded and ask what their specifications were for this type of defect I received the following from Sharp.\"The Liquid Crystal panel is a very high technology product with 3,147,264 thin film transistors, giving you fine picture details.  Occasionally, a few non-active pixels may appear on the screen as a fixed point of blue, green or red. Please note that this does not affect the performance of your product.Sincerely,Mrs. ***** ********AQUOS Advantage AdvisorCustomer Assistance CenterSharp Electronics Corporation1-87-SEE-AQUOSaquosadvantage@sharpusa.com\"It is my opinion that since this is a display system any error in the display would have direct affect to the performance of the product.  I have High Definition cable and these defects are easily noticed during low light and night scenes.A friend of mine had been considering purchasing a Sharp LCD HDTV but after hearing about my problems he is now planning on buying a Samsung.Gave it 2 stars because it is a very nice display but the defects are very annoying.  Sharp appears to have poor manufacturing processes and customer service. Why roll the dice with your hard earned money.I have shopped on Amazon for many years.  Their pass-through purchasing system has become very problematic with too many sellers each having numerous disparate reviews. If I had purchased this product from a brick & mortar store I would have been able to return it or exchange it.  With OneCall this is not an option.  In my opinion don't buy from Amazon, don't buy from OneCall, or and especially do not purchase a Sharp LCD TV.Joe H", "Date": "December 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great picture, a few features missing", "Author": "J. Suppe", "ReviewID": "R1NIKKXJULTJ37", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "From a geek perspective:This TV gives a great picture.  It has so far been great for me and outperforms my roommates 1yr old Bravia XBR in a few areas.  I was holding off for many months from buying and finally these were reduced to a reasonable price-size ratio.  I couldn't give 5 stars because there are several cons- none of which are deal breakers but they broke my heart to be missing or incomplete.  Overall, great set and I highly recommend over anything else on the market for quality and looks, although as far as usability features go they could be refined a bit more. As noted in there are some cons which I will reiterate here as well:Pro:- Great contrast ratio.- Size of the bordering on the set are small.- No LED lit logo (sony's do that).- Plenty of inputs.- Great motion response: games look great.  Great response in general actually: over a 25' VGA cable it looks great as a computer monitor.- Audio input for couple with VGA input.- RS232 port and decent specifications in the documentation to control the set.- Detachable speakersCons:- No Picture in Picture: with so much screen, only one input at a time?- No labeling of inputs: If your input is not digital it won't know what it is.- PC inputs are limited in resolution: Even though it is not practical to scale up to 1080p for VGA and be visible, it would be nice- especially since the set is tauted as being 'Full 1080'.  Although it does function and look nice at lower resolutions, not all of them are supported.- No DVI.- Speakers are not as great as they could be, although this set begs for wall mount and speaker removal (they are removable).- One feature of this thing is the 'Net' which is a really dumb downed slow web utility to view 'widgets' like current weather, stock prices, etc.  Usability of this feature is not so great and it is too slow to be purposeful.  Would be great if it were always on and customizable (email notifications would be great).", "Date": "November 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "excellent customer service", "Author": "S. joseph \"RomaVictor\"", "ReviewID": "R22NHFA7BK6PII", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I dont think I'll ever buy any other brand when it comes to televisions other than sharp tv's. Not just because they have one of the best picture qualityin the business but more importantly it is for their excellent customer service and programs sharp has implemented for their unhappy customers just like Iwas about a month or so ago.I owned a 26 inch LCD hdtv that i purchased in 2004 for 2k. it lasted for about 4 years before the picture went out on me suddenly and surprisingly. wouldhave cost me [...] bucks just to fix it according to the sharp authorized technician. I was upset! Paid 2grand for a tv that only lasted 4 years? I was not ahappy camper.I wanted to simply throw it away and buy a brand new tv of the same size for less than what it would cost me to fix it. but i was not happy and i wanted tolet sharp know about it. So i contacted sharp corporate offices and sent them an email complaining about the reliability of their product. I thought theywere just gonna ignore it and simply say sorry dude  you're out of warranty.to my amazement someone called me from customer service on the very same day i sent my email and apologised for the inconvenience, assured me that suchthings happens once in every 10000 sets or so and gave me a bunch of options. He basically said they could get me a brand new tv of the same size for freeor i could upgrade to a bigger size for a pro-rated price.well let's say i ended up with a LC52SE94U for less than 1/3 of the price that sharp advertised on it's website. It still cost me less than 50% compared tothe least expensive online retailer. I was very very happy and estatic.I know sony, panasonic, pioneer may have some good sets out there but I dont think their customer service comes close to Sharp's. Especially Panasonic,Have heard horrilbe stories about their customer service.I just wanted to share my positive experience to everyone who is considering to purchase a television sooner or later. Dont just look at the picturequality but also determine how good a company's customer service is before you invest your hard earned money into a very finite and fragile object.", "Date": "December 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very Happy with this TV", "Author": "Jeffery A. Johnson", "ReviewID": "RW7BR9I74DQUW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've only had the Sharp Aquos LC52SE94U a few days, but here is my initial impression.  First I'll say, so far, I'm very happy with this TV.Good pointsThe Sharp Aquos LC52SE94U has an extremely good picture quality (of course), and very bright.  Even on standard cable it looks very good.When watch analog channels you can see a small amount of pixelazation cause by the low resolution on a very large screen, but you really have to look for it.When you watch HD channels the picture is far better than you can imagine.The Smart Stretch option which causes 4:3 to be viewed at 16:9 works really well, often it is difficult to tell the screen was stretched.A bonus to me was when I scanned for channels I found I have about 50 digital channels and at least 10 of them in high def.  This is good news, I just have standard (analog) cable.Very good sound quality using the factory speakers, not audiophile quality, but as good as any TVs speakers I've ever heard.The screws and tools you need to mount the base and the speakers on the TV come packaged very nicely together.  Very professional job of packaging.Low pointsI was disappointed to find the Aquos did not have channel labeling (on analog channels - digital channels self label).  I use this feature a lot, and I have grown use to having it on my past TVs.  So, now I'm forced to write my channels down on a piece of paper so I know which is which (of course this is a moot point if you are using digital cable).The menu control to disable a channel is cumbersome at best.I don't like the way the power cord plugs in, it doesn't seem very secure for a unit designed to hang on the wall.", "Date": "August 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great picture", "Author": "Edmond Dantes", "ReviewID": "R26GDP90C1LIN2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The picture on this TV is absolutely beautiful.  I bought an Aquos Blu-Ray player at the same time and the two together are absolutely amazing.  This TV does an amazing job with HD signals but it is also impressive in displaying analog signals without looking pixellated.  I pump my audio through a home theater system so I can't say much about the speaker.The only thing that makes me knock a star off is that there is no picture-in-picture capability.  Originally, I hadn't thought about it since I don't use PIP much but it would be nice to have.", "Date": "October 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Still happy after a whole year", "Author": "R. Winningham", "ReviewID": "RV5KT4BRGN1AU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV about a year ago and watch it daily.  I really enjoy the display, even in well lit areas.  The matte finish was non-negotiable for me.  The room I have it in has many light sources, and even though they are all visible from the dispaly, none are reflected back from the matte finish on the display.  Compare that to the new Samsung's that are extremely reflective and are best used in darker areas.When I was deciding which display to purchase, I visited Best Buy several times to compare this and other sets.  To this day, the LC52SE94U remains the best looking set on the wall, at least to me.  If I had it to do over again, I'd have bought the same TV.  When I win the lottery, I'll get the bigger version.Here's my rundown of pro's and con's:Pros:* Matte display* Attractive bezel* Removable Speakers* Lots of inputs* 120-Hz much more pleasing to the eye than the competitionCons:* Lack of DVI input* Auto Brightness feature annoying* Stand does not swivelIf you're mounting this to the wall, and have a single HDMI cable coming from an upconverting receiver, it's nearly perfect.

This was exchanged at no cost with a different model, LC52LE700UN.  The LC52LE700UN, unlike the LC52SE94U, has a high gloss screen.  The matte finish screen was the primary consideration in buying the LC52SE94U.  Sharp customer service explained that the LC52SE94U has been discontinued and that they could not provide a replacement with a matte finish screen. In this installation, reflections from windows and lamps block significant portions of the picture.  I would not buy this product as it is no longer in production and the manufacturer will likely be unable to replace it with an equivalent product when it fails; of course, that all depends on the definition of \"equivalent\".", "Date": "August 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "great TV", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3UTKXLI5RPFSJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an outstanding TV. Bright clear picture, clean motion, lots of inputs. I considered the comparable Samsungs but did not like the shiny screen or frame. The picture quality was indistinguishable to my eyes in the store. I ultimately settled on Sharp due to the reports of extraordinary customer service for Sharp vs. much less satisfaction with Samsung customer service. I have not been disappointed with the Sharp so far.Update - After nearly 6 weeks, the wall mount finally arrived. Thumbs up for Sharp, thumbs down for Abe's of Maine.I would have rather purchased the TV from Amazon, but they do not sell this model direct. So, I bought from Abe's of Maine, who offered no tax, free shippping and a free wall mount. This made their price substantially less than other vendors; moreover, Abe's was highly rated as a vendor. My experience? I cannot recommend Abe's of Maine (actually, Abe's of New Jersey). After I ordered the TV online, I got an e-mail to call them to discuss the order. Not surprisingly, a high pressure salesman tried to get me to upgrade everything from the mode of delivery, to the free wall mount, to an extended warranty, even to a different TV. I did upgrade the delivery as what came for free was \"curbside delivery\" and got a mount that was thinner (and tiltable) compared to the \"free mount\" that was included with the TV which was not tiltable. After about 2.5 weeks, the TV showed up. Delivery was quick and easy and the driver helped me remove the TV from the box and set it up. But the wall mount I ordered was not included, forcing me to scramble to find a solution to put the TV on temporarily. So far, I am still waiting for the wall mount, more than a week after reporting it missing.Bottom line - This Sharp is one fine TV.

So far BB is perfect. Be sure to leave your TV on for 36 hours and then check a channel with a blank screen for stuck on pixels. These will only get worse folks.Original review,BB delivered this a few hours ago and I have it up and running without a hitch. It is as thin in places as the Samsung 850 but not over the whole cabinet. Picture is perfect. The manual doesn't mention 120MHZ video but Demo Mode does\"You can select the image from 3 types of demo mode.Mode 1: 120Hz Fine motion advanced with the picture.Mode 2: 120Hz Fine motion advanced.Mode 3: AQUOS net.\"Advanced menu says\"Fine Motion AdvancedUse Fine Motion Advanced to view fast-action videomore clearly.On: For obtaining a clearer image.Off: No adjustment.Fine Motion Advanced may cause image noise. If thisoccurs, turn the function \"Off\".\"So I am not sure what all that means and will be testing it over the next few days to see what is up with the 120MHZ.So far a very fine LCD with no problems. It tagged my free 21U on the HDMI inputs and allowed me to lable it as BD21U.Stand by for more info later.Update/the speaker terminals and external speaker bar rocks. I assume you could hook up a couple of speakers to those outputs?Update2/ the series \"\"\"Sharp LC-52XS1U-S\"\"\"is the thin one and not the 94 series limited edition.
