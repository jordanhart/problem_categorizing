It performs today just as it did the day it was delivered to our home.This television (both size and viewing screen) is huge!  We went from a 32\" tv to this giant. Images are life-size.  You definitely need to have space between your sofa and the screen.Watching sports games and movies are like you're in the stadium or the theater, so get your hot dogs, nachos and popcorn.I would definitely recommend this model.  We live in a smaller place now, so we're trying to sell our set.  But if you have the space, its a guaranteed winner.", "Date": "November 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellant buy", "Author": "Don", "ReviewID": "R3VHS04ZJF8XST", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought ours 5 years ago. If you are into sports and nature TV you can't beat this.  You are right on the field or rink with the players or the wildlife. The one thing I would caution about is that your TV viewing will increase. High Definition makes everything you watch an experience and the size definitely only enhances it. You do need to have 12 to 15 feet minimum of room between your seating and the set to really enjoy this. A room 18 to 20 feet in depth is ideal. A good surround system also makes a world of difference as most high def is also broadcast in 5.1 surround. You can pack a lot of people around this TV and with the Olympics coming up we expect to be sharing our house a lot. In 5 years we have not ever thought of replacing this set as the quality has not diminished.", "Date": "December 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Timothy R.

I was looking at getting a new 3D flat screen but can't pull the trigger because this TV still looks great and I have never done any maintenance to it since I got it.

Johnson", "ReviewID": "R2LJA42QHXOAIF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my Hitachi 65SWX20B in the fall of 2002, and over 10 years later it works just like new.  It has never had a service problem.  It is my primary television and gets lots of use (5-8 hours daily).  It has 1080I capability so the HD picture is very clear.  I actually prefer the picture over some of the newer flat screens.  The one drawback is the size of the cabinet, but mine has been built into a wall since first installed, so all I see is the 65-inch screen.  Whatever Hatachi did in designing and manufacturing this television, they sure did it right !!", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "65-inch widescreen (16:9 aspect ratio) HDTV-ready projection TV; 61 x 59.875 x 28 inches (W x H x D)\nEnhanced VirtualHD digital video processing upgrades conventional signals to near-HD quality\n3:2 correction and 26-point motion-adaptive interpolation ensures smooth, seamless images from any source\nDVI digital input provides compatibility with the latest generation of digital set-top boxes\nMagic Focus Convergence automatically aligns the picture for optimum performance at the touch of a button", "Name": "Hitachi 65SWX20B 65-Inch 16:9 Projection HDTV-Ready TV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZV2RTNWTL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00006CFLY"}}
