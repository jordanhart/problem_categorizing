The model you provided, the CW46T9FW is indeed a 120hz model TV. We've realized our customers may be confused by the TV's on screen display which shows 60hz. The purpose of the on screen display is to show information of the signal being received by the TV from your video source. For example, it may display the following video resolutions from a cable/satellite receiver, 480i/p, 720p, or 1080i/p.The TV will also display the incoming refresh rate from your source. Historically, average refresh rates are 60hz-72hz, however, 60hz is the standard for most video sources. Although you see 60hz on the information window, the TV processes and converts all content to 120hz to improve motion estimation and compensation.Please let me know if you have any questions.Thank You, Eric Gamboa | Sr. Customer Support SpecialistWestinghouse Digital, LLCIt is a good value and a good tv.

However, after watching it for a few days, I realized a couple of things: first of all, blacks almost looked purple, and were not very deep and were extremely prone to artifacts. Second of all, when watching live sports, there was a very slight stutter whenever the camera panned. It wasn't much, but it was enough to drive me crazy everytime I watched any sports. Unfortunately, I was dissatisfied and returned the TV, and got an LG. Much happier now. This TV would be good for people that aren't too picky about picture quality, but if you're a sports enthusiast or videophile, I'd look elsewhere.

It is a beautiful TV in appearance. The product was exactly as described, and I am exremely satisfied, and would recommend to everyone. The TV was packaged very well and arrived in perfect condition even though the packade was damaged in a few areas. The TV was easy to set up. I experienced none of the short comings that were in several reviews, The picture is bright, crystal clear, and no ajustments were needed. Beautiful and accurate \"skin\" tones, and vibrant color across the spectrum. I was dreading the sound quality from several reviews. I assure you, the quality of the sound is certainly good if not excellant. This thing is \"loud\" and clear. It even has good bass response, and I have not had to change any settings out of the box. To say I am pleased with this purchase is an understatement. I am a perfectionist in many ways, and could complain about the slow response changing channels, the smallest buttons on the remote. I run direct cable TV without a \"box\", so I use the supplied remote. This two elements pale in comparison of the performance of the picture and sound quality, which is why we buy this entertinment product. If the picture was any brighter, I would have to wear sun glasses. The only thing I would want in addition would be a USB port for picture viewing, however my Blu-Ray has a USB and an SD card reader.

I paid 348 for this t.v., and it was well worth it.The t.v. had a small technical issue when i first got it.  It would turn on and you could hear the sound, but the picture would not come on.  This happened very infrequently, and seemed to stop over time.  Also, the sound quality of the t.v. is not great, I mean it's not horrible, and you can hear it clearly enough, but it does not have alot of volume to it, and can get static-sounding if you try to turn it up too loud.  This is where the t.v. loses a star.However, i gave this 4 stars because of the awesomeness of some of it's features.  For example, you have the option to select between home use and retail display, using retail display will give you better picture quality, while home use gives you better energy conservation, so that was a pretty decent feature right off the bat.  The picture quality and color on this t.v. are as good as any that I have seen, the display is awesome, and it also works well as a monitor if you plug your computer into it.  It has plenty of hdmi, and component cable slots so plugging your devices in is easy, and accessable.  And did I mention the price? because the price was awesome, though I see it's not available now for the same price I had.It also comes with an extended warranty through westinghouse.  And from reviews I have seen elsewhere, they seem to be a great company in regards to honoring their warranty.All in all, dont let the lack of high end name brand desuade you from this t.v., it's of great quality, and has a couple of flaws, but ultimately is awesome if you get a real good price on it like I did.", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "bad reviews but this tv rocks", "Author": "donielle jabbar", "ReviewID": "R4VD5VEYXFWIR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i was a little skeptical about purchasing this tv after reading some of the reviews but i decided to give it a shot since it was on sale boy am i happy i made this purchase this tv works great and the sound is pretty darn good as well", "Date": "April 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent picture for the price", "Author": "Arthur T.

Whether this occurred from an insult incurred during shipping or a defect, I can't confirm.  This TV is also very heavy.  When we returned it and bought another model (same size) we noticed that the other model was much, much lighter.

I desperately wanted to upgrade to something slim, sleek, pretty, and with lots of available connections. I shopped for weeks. After finding this deal, I went for it. Great price for a large TV! I wasn't looking for amazing, life-like picture. Just something that lets you see the screen as you sit on the other side of the room. The blacks are not very strong. Some mixed dark and light scenes are pixely in the dark areas. The sound seemed good for the 30 seconds it was on until I plugged in my stereo. PS I've had this for about 4 months.There is an annoying compatibility problem however. In my old TV, I plugged my bluray player into my home entertainment system via HDMI, and then the HES into the TV via HDMI. The video was transferred to the TV and the sound came through the entertainment system's speakers. Very nice. But this connection does not work on this TV. I can plug them in separately (the HES is a DVD player combo), both devices must be directly plugged into the TV. If I use the Middle-Man-Method, the TV says \"Unsupported Mode.\" I have researched and read this happens sometimes with this brand of TVs for other devices including PS3s. I suppose it is a firmware problem than can be upgraded, and yet the company's website does not provide and firmware downloads. As far as I know, there is no way around this. Oh well. So now I use the DVD player for awesome sound, and the Bluray player for Bluray discs and online streaming. I have the TV's outward audio plugged into my small stereo for better sound when using the Bluray or my Gamecube.

They have not answered even once. I guess the person who reviewed and did get a reply was lucky. However, I can tell you the response is a complete lie, there is no way this TV converts everything to 120Hz, it just doesn't display 120Hz.I have seen a lot of debate about this TV online as to whether it is 120Hz or not, I am pretty adept with electronics and I can tell you, this is NOT a 120Hz television. 120Hz televisions actually upscale 60Hz signals (as currently there are no widely available 120Hz sources), and you can visually tell this is happening in the picture (check out a local BestBuy and they will show you a 120Hz TV side by side with a regular 60Hz TV). Normally in televisions with this feature, there is an option in the menus to turn the feature on or off (as sometimes for certain sources such as sports, the 120Hz upscaling looks bad).So unless this TV is the only one in it's class (or in the consumer market for that matter) that can actually display a true 120Hz signal, this is falsely advertised as a 120Hz TV. There is no 120Hz upscaling feature anywhere. My parents have a smaller 19\" Westinghouse and I was impressed by it's price and quality, but I am very disappointed in Westinghouse for lying about it's television's features.In conclusion, if this set happens to be the same price or cheaper than other sets, it's a good buy as far as sound quality and picture, although not 120Hz it's above average slightly in those respects. However, that only warrants an extra star, because it's only worth one star advertized as a 120Hz television since it is NOT 120Hz.I hope that Westinghouse will address this issue, at that point I would be happy to update my review with the results.", "Date": "July 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "For the Price", "Author": "James K.
