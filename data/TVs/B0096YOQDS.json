{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Hard to beat this Vizio TV in this price range.", "Author": "Mark Rogers \"Learned the hard way...so you do...", "ReviewID": "R2IULSEY1SK1F4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned and used the VIZIO M3D470KDE for a few weeks now. I have read all of the reviews and comments here on A_Z. Here are my comments and responses:Overall value:This TV sells for a little over $700 but has many features found on more expensive TVs. (I bought it on \"Black Friday\" and got a $100 gift card as well, so my final outlay for this TV was $629). To compare it to TVs that cost $1000 or more misses the point. VIZIO M3D470KDE has 3D, Internet Apps, Remote with keyboard, very good picture quality and more- all at a very reasonable price. I think it is a great value in this price range. Is it as good as a $1200 Panasonic or Samsung? Maybe not. But it is a very good TV at a very good price. And for those who care about this sort of thing, Vizio is an American company, with administrative, engineering and technical support staff located here in the US, staffed by US citizens (the TVs themselves are not, however, made in America- unfortunately, no one that I am aware of produces flat-screen TVs in the US). My daughter has had a Vizio HDTV for about 5 years. It was passed on to my second daughter, driven across Pennsylavania a couple of times, transported in and out of apartments and dorms, set-up and taken down multiple times. It remains very durable and solid. So my experience with Vizio as a brand has been very good.Inputs:This TV has a ton of inputs. 4 HDMI inputs, Ethernet (for wired network/Internet) RGB (for computer), Component Video & Audio, Digital Audio output, 2 USB inputs, Coax (for cable or antenna) and more. It can handle just about anything you can throw at it. There is no S-Video input, but devices that require S-Video are just about non-existent anymore. The inputs/output are on the lower right corner of the back of the TV and I have hooked-up all sorts of standard cables with no problems and have them hidden behind the TV on it's wall mount. It found my wireless Internet connection easily (but I am using the wired Ethernet port for network/Internet). I had a weird issue getting my TiVo signal to pass through my Yamaha A/V receiver, but it lit right up when directly connected to the TV. I then used the Digital Audio out to get the sound from the TV back into the receiver (and from there to the 7.1 surround sound system). It looks and sounds GREAT! This TV has every input I needed and more.Set-up:Setting this TV up was a breeze. It found my Internet connection with no problem, the menus to set up the devices, adjust the picture, give each input a name that you choose, and other functions, are easy and for the most part clear. I mounted the TV temporarily on its stand which was very sturdy. I later mounted the TV on a standard, VESA-compliant wall mount (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LL5JDA/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00), and it fit with no problems and works great.Remote:The remote is small and reasonably comfortable to use. The keyboard on the back of the remote is a terrific feature and makes input of alpha characters simple matter (numeric characters are input using the number keys on the front of the remote). This becomes a really big convenience when using Internet applications that require a login or have search functions. It is 10X faster than the old-fashioned method of picking letters off of an alpha chart one at a time to enter information. It has good range and works well. It's easy to access menus and change inputs.Screen:The 47 inch screen is a good size for a medium-sized room. The TV has a fairly narrow bezel except at the bottom, and is not distracting. Overall its thin and light for TV this size. I've not found any dead pixels. The picture is sharp and clear and the color reproduction is good. I wish the depth of the black color was a deeper and more solid black, but overall, I am satisfied with the screen and color reproduction. There are number of color presets such as \"vivid\", \"movie\", \"baseball\", etc., which make it pretty easy to find a color reproduction scheme that most people will enjoy.3D:This is the first TV that I've ever seen 3-D on. So I don't have anything to compare it to. But I think 3-D movies from my 3D capable Blu-ray player (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00752R4PK/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00) look absolutely awesome on it. Vizio provides four sets of 3D glasses with the TV (some other companies force you to buy extra 3-D glasses). The TV recognized the 3-D output from the DVD player automatically and made it simple to watch 3-D movies- and they look great on this TV.The \"Soap Opera\" Effect controversy:Some reviewers complained that they cannot turn-off the video smoothing that causes the \"soap opera\" effect. There is a menu item to switch \"Game Mode\" on or off on the TV within the setting for each input (TV, DVD, Game, etc.) which controls the \"soap opera\" effect. So it CAN be controlled. That said, in my house, the overall vote is that the video smoothing or \"Soap Opera\" effect looks BETTER in most circumstances. It adds a sharpness and depth to the picture that we like (overall). Not everyone will agree, and obviously some people here seem to feel that the video smoothing is so horrible that it negates the value of the TV overall. I cannot agree with that AT ALL. YMMV. If you think that the \"soap opera\" effect is something that might bother you, I urge you to go to a bricks and mortar store where there are lots of TVs on display and asked the salesman to demonstrate video smoothing.\"Flashlighting\" effect:All edge-lit LED panels that I have seen have some \"flashlighting\" effect. On a black screen (like the start-up screen or certain menu screens) you can see brighter lighting in the corners of the screen than in the middle - as if there were small \"flashlights\" pointing in from the corners. However, when viewing a normal picture from a television show, a DVD, YouTube, or any source that I have tried, I am totally unable to see ANY \"flashlighting\" effect (and I have tried). Perhaps it has something to do with the way that the brightness and contrast settings are fixed? (I used a THX video that came with my TiVo for balancing all of the color & picture controls). So, I repeat, I see ZERO \"flashlighting\" when viewing a full-screen video source. I cannot agree AT ALL with the reviewers who felt that \"flashlighting\"  ruins the picture on this TV.The \"Netflix\" streaming issue:A software Update sent to the TV via the Internet by Vizio in January, 2013 fixed the Netflix streaming issue described below. There is no longer any Netflix streaming issue with this TV. I left the original problem description below for reference only.(Like others who have posted reviews I cannot effectively get Netflix to stream on this television as of this writing (12/17/2012). Other web streaming services like YouTube and Amazon work fine. The problem is some combination of the Netflix transmission, their reception and re-transmission from the Vizio servers and then reproduction of the stream on this TV. The TV connects to my Netflix account. I can browse titles, and see my Netflix queue. But each time I tried to stream from Netflix I get a message: \"We're having trouble playing this title right now. Try again later or try a different title.\" If you Google this error message you'll see that Vizio is far from the only company to have products that display this message (LG, Samsung, Apple and more show in the search results). I've spoken with both Netflix and Vizio about the problem. The head of customer service at Vizio in South Dakota tells me that their engineers are aware of it and working on a fix. However, part of the problem must also lie with Netflix, so engineers at both ends may have to work together to resolve it. At some point in the near future I am hopeful that Vizio will \"push\" a software update that will resolve the problem- as I have been promised by Vizio. In the interim, I can stream Netflix through my TiVo and my Panasonic Blu-ray player, so this is really not a big deal for me. However if the ability to stream Netflix on this TV is an immediate concern for you, then please be advised that there is a possibility that it may not work for you until Vizio updates the software).Conclusion:For my money this TV provides a lot of bang for the buck. I'm very pleased with it overall and for those hoping to get a good-sized, Internet & 3D capable, LED LCD TV for around $700, it is very hard to beat. I recommend it without hesitation.", "Date": "December 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very happy I chose this TV", "Author": "C. Starke", "ReviewID": "R172UYGRCU24LG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been wanting to buy a Samsung 46\" TV for a long time, but after learning about (and witnessing) Samsung's capacitor problem, I started looking at Vizio.  I had heard good things about their TVs, and the bonus for me is that they're an American company.  I made sure to check out reviews for this model, and CNet declared it \"one of the best LED TV values on the market.\"  I couldn't agree more.Setup was very simple, no difficulties to report there.  Just make sure to go into the menu and adjust the picture setting to your liking, since I found the picture to be kind of dark when I first turned on the unit.  This was probably because my home theater setup is close to my front door, which has windows on the sides that create a lot of ambient light in that area.The remote is great! I love the fact that it has a full qwerty keyboard on the back.  In an age of networked home theater components, it's nice to be able to type in a search on Amazon Instant Video without having to use number keys, or worse, a d-pad to select and enter letters.  Searching is so much less cumbersome now!  There's only one downside, which is that you have to be conscious of how you're holding the remote so you don't accidentally press keys on the back while you're using the buttons on the front.  Not a huge deal, though.  Vizio could easily solve this with a simple hinged plastic cover over the back of the remote.  Another plus is that there are 3 dedicated buttons at the top of the remote: one for Amazon Instant Video, one for Netflix, and one for M-Go.  I only use the first 2, but prior to buying this TV, I had to navigate through a series of screens on my blu-ray player to get to them.I can't really comment on the sound quality of this TV's speakers, since all my audio plays through a surround speaker system.  The only exception is the Nintendo Wii, which allows me to say that I have no complaints about the speakers compared to my expectations.The picture is nothing short of excellent.  Deep blacks, vivid colors, 'nuff said.  I did find one dead pixel, but that's to be expected and it has no impact on the viewing experience.  I haven't watched any 3D content on it, so I can't comment on that.  Honestly, I couldn't care less about 3D on a television.  It had no influence on my decision to buy this TV.", "Date": "November 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pleased with the quality.  Great Value.", "Author": "Susan", "ReviewID": "RKRUKNXDXE75D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this LED after comparing several other models.  I simply couldn't justify the additional expense of the higher priced LG, Panasonic or Samsung LED models.  It was not a mistake.  The picture out of the box is amazing and the set up was quick and easy.  The colors are vivid and everything from my streaming media to football games are crisp and clear.  I was most surprised by the quality of the 3D.  I watched both Avatar and The Lorax and it was a truly enjoyable experience! The trim around the display is thin enough that it doesn't distract from the display like my previous Samsung. I have not noticed any inconsistancies in the display.  I found the keyboard side of the remote helpful but the buttons on the primary side are quite small and close together. Internet setup was a snap since the set immediately found and connected wirelessly to my network.  I will say, like several other users, I too have experienced a problem accessing Netflix that support was unable to resolve.  All of the other services including Amazon Instant Prime have worked without fail.  So with the exception of Netflix, which I hope Vizio will address soon, I am pleased with the VIA smart apps.  Excellent picture quality, great features and easy set up makes this a good choice for viewers looking to get the best value without going over budget!Update 11/27/12With the help of other reviewers, I think I have found the problem with the \"game mode\" setting.  I use an over the air antenna for my HD channels. Game mode does not appear to be available when the input source is set to \"TV\".  I was unable to locate that setting until I connected my WD Live box via HDMI.  When I have that HDMI input source selected I am able to turn game mode on.  So I guess as long as you have cable or a game console, or are watching via any of the HDMI inputs you can eliminate the soap opera effect. If anyone has their Input Source set to TV under settings and has \"game mode\" as an option please leave me a comment because I'm still looking to resolve that issue.There is definately some confusion with the Netflix issue.  It appears there are different versions of firmware as well as the actual software version of the widget itself that are causing the problems.  I don't know of a way to pull a Vizio firmware update on this set so again, if anyone does please leave a comment. (Mine is 2.37.9)  Even after reinstalling my Netflix widget (2.1.4), the version is still older than the version the Yahoo store is listing(v3.1.4) which is another oddity.  In any case, while I am able to activate and see my Netflix queue, my selections will not make it past the \"loading\" point erroring out with \"We're having trouble playing this title...etc\".There are a number of things that can impact how a reviewer rates a product. I personally find reviews can serve more than one purpose in that new users can often help each other out.  Rather than suggesting others \"read their manual\" or \"learn how to use their product\" maybe reviewers who have successfully overcome these obstacles can help shed some light.  I would really welcome a comment from a user that can confirm they have Netflix up and running under firmware 2.37.9 on the 47\" \"KDE\" model.A week in, I am still extremely pleased with every other aspect of the TV!Update 1/15/2013Still very pleased with my TV! Turned it on this morning and received a notice that the firmware had been updated.  I can confirm that it appears they have finally resolved the Netflix issues as mine is working flawlessly now. Big thanks to everyone who escalated that problem to Vizio support and stayed on top of it! Prooves they ARE listening!", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV (Vizio M3D470KDE 47\" NOT 55\"!), you CAN disable Smoothing", "Author": "dalljacks", "ReviewID": "R2KDFQFXSGG5WM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, some people have been thinking that some of the reviews that have been given for this TV have been for the 55\" not the 47\".  I am here to say that I am reviewing the 47\" NOT the 55\", just to be clear.We got this TV last night, and I was completely blown away!  There is a little messing around with the picture settings before you can really get a good picture.  They have preset settings such as Golf, Cinema, etc, which are only useful in setting the backlighting on how you want it, and then from there you can change the tint, color, etc.  I personally liked the setting of \"Vivid\" because the backlighting is at 100% and I felt it brought out the most colors.  Also, I put the contrast up to about 65 - 68, to make the blacks look dark.You CAN disable smoothing on this TV, which is good, because it gives me a headache, and looks \"Soap Opera-ish.\"  Like everyone else has said, just go into the \"settings\" and turn \"Game mode\" on.  We looked at the Huluplus app, since this is the only one we really use, and it worked great.  I can't comment on if the Netflix app works or not, since we don't use Netflix, but if we ever did, we have a bluray player and a PS3 we could use.  I figure that if you have this TV without either a bluray or PS3, you will not be fully experiencing this TV, and since most bluray players have a Netflix app... it shouldn't really even matter.Now for the 3D.  We watched \"The Lion King 3D\" and it was amazing!  I kept thinking that it the scenery looked like someone had cut a hole in our wall and we were looking through it.  The stars in some scenes look very bright and extremely real with amazing clarity.  We didn't buy this TV for the 3D, but we are now glad we did.  Just to note, there are color, tint, contrast, etc. settings for the 3D mode as well.  So make sure that you adjust those to make the 3D look as good as it can.  I also played a PS3 game on it for a little bit, and it again looked great.The remote with the full Qwerty keyboard on the back is also extremely handy.  It made logging in to Huluplus a breeze.  The initial set up is also very very easy.  It walks you through step by step as soon as you turn on the TV.The only thing I kind of don't like about the TV is that you can't just plug it in and then watch it, but have to mess around with the settings to get the picture to get it right.  It took me less than 20 mins to get a good setting though, so that wasn't that bad, and even though it took a little bit of time, it was worth it to get the TV to look as good as possible.  Someone on another site also complained about the corners have spots of light, which I did notice, and I assume it's because of the edge-lit LED, and the corners being sections where the light from each corner is hitting each other.  However, I only noticed it on menu or settings screens.  I never once noticed it during watching a movie or app.  So that really isn't a problem at all.  I also didn't notice an \"update selection\" for the firmware update.  I'm going to go home and see if I can find something like that tonight, but I'm thinking the TV may automatically update by itself like our bluray player does.This TV is awesome!  No regrets at all.  We will be enjoying this for years I'm sure.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price. Learn how to use the product people before you review it.", "Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "R2IJ2QDN35O3Y7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this tv for the family room and it's a secondary tv. For the price point it is great; So my review is based on price vs quality and features. Every feature works fine and in bad reviews it's a bad user and not a bad product. Netflix works perfect on it as long as you update the tv. First thing you do before playing around with it is make sure you go in the settings and perform an update. Second thing is that you will have the \"soap opera effect\" right out of the box which is an issue with all tvs with a high refresh rate and digital processing. Now to correct this you have to go to settings and turn ON game mode. This is a very important step as if you dont turn on game mode you will most definitely return the tv because the picture looks funny. Any way great tv for the money. My primary tv is a 46\" Samsung smart tv that cost double what this one cost and is definitely alot better but for 749 samsung doesnt have a tv thats as good as this one.", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "One of the better budget-level TVs available", "Author": "Scott J", "ReviewID": "R2DEMG4I1KPAJC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Decided it was time for a TV upgrade this tax season.  My previous TV was also a Vizio, and I used it for 5+ years without a single problem.  After reading countless consumer reviews on TVs in the $600-$700 range, I finally decided to go with the M3D470KDE.  And overall  I do not regret my purchase one bit.  There are a few shortcomings (in areas I expected) and several advantages (in areas I did not expect).  Let me run through a few quick Pros and Cons that I think will help round out your decision to buy this TV, and give you a better idea of what to expect when it arrives.PROS-3D is brilliant.  If you have any worries about passive 3d not looking as good as the active 3d with it's $100 glasses, rest easy.  The only caviat is that you need to have the TV aligned at eye-level.  If you have a wall mount, make sure it is properly aligned.-VIA (Vizio Internet Apps) work great functionally.  Whatever problems they had with Netflix in the past is now fixed, so ignore the one-star reviews that use that as their only complaint.  It's too bad you can't turn off the Smooth-Motion Blurring (see Cons list) for the VIA, but I use my PS3 for most of those anyway-The picture is impressive.  Granted, straight out of the box, you might have initial doubts.  It DOES require a small amount of calibration to get the picture exactly right.  Disney sells an HDTV Calibration Blu-Ray I used to tweak everything just right, but once I did, it looks better than I could have hoped for.  Rich colors, decent blacks, and the backlighting is barely noticable.-Many more little surprises. The profile is crazy thin and it weighs less than my old LCD.  Adaptive backlighting will automatically adjust the backlight to make sure ambient light doesn't ruin the picture. Low power consumption helps lower electric bill costs.Cons-Annoying screen glare.  The glass on the screen is a glossy finish, as opposed to a matte finish like a lot of HDTVs have.  This means that any light directly opposite the TV will be reflected.  We have windows directly behind our sofa, and so any daylight that comes through pretty much makes the screen not visible.  Keep this in mind when you are placing your TV.-Smooth Motion Blurring.  This creates a strange \"Soap-Opera Effect\" that you may have seen in other reviews.  Luckily, on any of the inputs, this can be disabled by going into Settings, and turning ON Game Mode.  Unfortunately, for the built-in VIA like Netflix and Hulu, it cannot be disabled.-Speakers are flimsy.  Spend the money on a low-profile sound bar.  I bought a Philips one for $100 and it works perfectly.  Problem solved.-The packaging SUCKS.  I had to send back my first one because FedEx crushed the box, damaging the TV.  The corners of the TV are foam-braced in the box, but the screen is totally succeptable to damage if not treated carefully.  Amazon was really great about replacing it (they overnighted me a new one) but you may want to have it held at the Carriers facility to avoid it being tossed around on a delivery truck.Overall, for the price, you can't find a better full-featured LED TV in this size, anywhere.  After a little calibration, you will be amazed at all this baby can do.", "Date": "March 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Edge Lighting or \"Flashlighting\" is a serious problem.", "Author": "Big T", "ReviewID": "R2N4ZQUF2KMFVW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "There's a ton of reviews discussing this TV's high points so I won't go into them here.  The picture is great and all and so is the 3D.  \"Soap opera\" effect is easily avoided if you wish by putting your TV into \"game mode\" int he settings.The edge lighting problem is a bigger deal than most reviews have let on.  I'm sorry it's not 2005 where this is just acceptable and something you have to deal with.  In 2013, most LEDs have very minimal edge lighting problems if any.  They simply cost more.  Even cheaper models from Samsung and Sony don't have this issue.  But this TV does and it's pronounced.  Now if you're not into video gaming, you won't notice it.  The brightness of 99% of what you watch on TV will cover this up well and you'll love your TV because for the price it has a very impressive picture on a 47 inch screen.  The problem is if you are gaming, where you want your blacks black and your whites white.  There's a very noticeable amount of flashlighting in each corner of the set, some more pronounced than others.  I spoke with Vizio customer service (very polite, knowledgeable, and American) because I thought this was a problem with MY TV.  But after speaking with them, this is just supposed to be acceptable.  They've seen pictures of my TV and they feel my TV has \"minimal to no\" edge lighting for my set.  Now granted, I'm a bit picky when it comes to this.  When switching inputs the total black screen, it's very highly noticeable but they said this is common int his model and they didn't want to fix it under warranty because, essentially to them, there's nothing to fix.If you are buying a new TV as a gamer, I'd recommend LCD technology.  Plasma has deeper blacks but the \"Burn in\" risk is still present.  Having constant images for hours can cause a \"burn in\" of the picture.  This isn't a big deal to TV watchers but to gamers it is due to HUDs, life bars, scoreboards, etc.  I've seen it on TVs before and it would annoy me, so I'd avoid that.  LCD seems to be the way to go because at least you'd avoid this flash lighting situation.

The smart TV features worked flawlessly, no problem with Netflix or the other features even though I have a poor connection from my WiFi (being all the way on the other side of the house) all the services work great, in fact the Netflix works better through the TV then on my Xbox 360.USB sticks can be connected directly to the TV for playing and viewing media right from the stick.  3D movies are available for download through various means although Netflix, Amazon Prime, and other services seem to be lacking on content (none available except HULU) which forced me to find them through my own means *cough torrents cough* However there is plenty out there.  So far: UP, Finding Nemo, Avatar, Jackass 3D and a few others I was interested in all worked stunningly played through my USB stick.I was not originally looking for a 3DTV, but for the price I paid for the Vizio TV through Amazon, I would not have been able to get a similar sized big brand (Sony, Samsung, etc) non-3D without paying considerably more.

I chose this TV because it has TOP OF THE LINE PICTURE QUALITY, is INTERNET CONNECTED, is 3D ENABLED, has PASSIVE 3D which just is more comfortable, is COMPATIBLE WITH AMAZON INSTANT VIDEOS, and is ONE OF THE CHEAPEST TV around!1. This TV is a Premium TV regardless of price. I have been researching 3D TVs for almost a year now. I tried premium TVs like the Sony XBR929 series and in all honesty I can tell you that the difference in picture, if there would be less than 10%. You really have to have the 2 sets next to each other to be able to see any difference. In real life this TV will provide as good of a picture as of any other TV out in 2012 or before. 4K will be definitely better but those cost 20 times more.2. This TV streams NETFLIX. I am stressing this point because the main reason why this TV ratings on Amazon is not 4+ stars is because the original firmware didn't work for it. Now that the new firmware is out Netflix works wonderfully. Check the low reviews a lot of them had issues with Netflix.3. This TV is probably one of the very few that came in 2012 that is Amazon Instant videos compatible( 2012 LG TVs are not compatible, I say this because LG has higher pricing but good quality), Pandora compatible, among other many internet Apps. Most of us Amazon Prime members know that Amazon Instant is Amazing. It has Netflix like free streaming AND Rental services like VUDU. Which puts it on my Top list for entertainment streaming services. It is important for me to be able to stream Amazon Instant on my internet connected TV. Watch for it this year.

The number of apps has grown since I bought this TV as well, so those looking for Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, Vudu, or Amazon Instant Video can find them here.The only real complaint is, because the TV uses horizontal tubes for lighting, you can notice the four corners of the screen are a bit lighter than the rest of the picture.  MOST people won't notice this at all, but TV aficionados certainly will.  Considering the price of this TV over other HDTVs of similar size, it's a small trade-off, in my opinion.One other caveat: do not buy unless you're investing in a home theater to go with it.  Not only will you need a 3D DVD player to enjoy 3D movies, but you'll want to get yourself a nice 5.1 set-up as well, as the TV's sound is pretty tinny, and I don't recommend using it unless you have no other options.", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "lived up to expectations", "Author": "AskMeAboutRNA", "ReviewID": "R2SLA48BZW1CWB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not much to add --- other reviews have been quite detailed already.

I have been shopping around for YEARS for a TV that would meet some very specific criteria.  1080p, check; 120Hz, check; Smart TV, check.I was originally looking at the Vizio M470SL, which I believe to be basically the same TV, but without the 3D.  I also looked at the E-Series Vizios, but the lack of a QWERTY keyboard on the back of the remote steered me away from those (you need to go to 60\" on E-series before they throw in the QWERTY keyboard).  At the time of purchase, the M3D470KDE was actually cheaper than the 2D M470SL, so I figured, what the heck, maybe I will use it someday.The picture looks great (especially after some tweaking).  The only issue that I had was the dreaded \"Soap Opera Effect\" where the foreground stick out from the background like a sore thumb and makes it look like a Soap Opera.  It was so bad, that my wife noticed it and said, \"Hey, it looks like a Soap Opera!  Is it supposed to look like that?\"However, I went to Google and found a good forum of owners of this model TV and one thread in particular made me no longer question that this was the TV for me.  If you have trouble with the soap opera effect on this TV, go to Menu > Settings > Game Mode > and turn it on.  If you only do it in the Picture Settings in the menu, it won't do anything about the Soap Opera effect!Once I did that, the picture is awesome, the size is perfect for the room that it is in. the audio is sufficient for my needs, though I am considering buying wither a soundbar, or a digital to analog audio converter so that I can use my old home theater speakers that still work fine and I can get 5.1 on, with a sub-woofer.I was a bit apprehensive about getting a TV shipped to me, since they can be pretty sensitive.

If you're looking for a top of the line flawless hdtv set move along nothing to see here.  As some have mentioned the \"flashlighting\" on this set is a bit strong but it never really deterred from the experience.  I've tried out a lot of 3D movies and it was overall really immersive and pretty great.  The effect varied based on movie to movie.  It was obvious which movies were built from the ground up for 3D and which ones tacked it on.  I also played a variety of games in 3D on the xbox 360 and the results were mixed but for games that really knew how to master the effect it was amazing.  Black ops looked pretty incredible in 3D.  Once you calibrate the tv you'll notice a huge improvement.  Do yourself a favor and turn off all the extra crap.  For example the auto dimming and noise reduction.  Look online there are many free ways to calibrate your tv set or you can also purchase them as well.  But please don't have someone come to your house and charge you to do it, best buy etc...  It's not that difficult and you can save yourself a lot of money.  But if money is not a problem than by all means.  Then again if money were not an issue you'd probably be getting a 4K tv right now.  But I digress on to the bad stuff.  The \"soap opera effect\" can not be turned off unless you are connected to an hdmi source or possibly component or composite.  As I have all but my \"bunny ear\" antenna connected via Hdmi I can not attest to component or composite options. The effect is awful and ruins movies and games.  For sports I don't mind it too much it does help make things a little less blurry.  But not having the option to switch it off from every source is a bad part on vizio.  The remote is pretty terrible and sometimes it's hard to get it to register.  Luckily I don't have to use it to often.  The included apps are ok but are slow to load and to navigate around.  Do yourself a favor and get an apple tv, roku box, xbox or anything else besides using these built in apps.  In a pinch they'll do but the experience is subpar.  It's nice that they're there though and most smart tv apps I've used on other televisions are just as bad if not worst.  This even on more expensive sets, so it's still nice they're on there and comparable to other expensive options. In the end for a tv at this price and size and the features it's an amazing value.  You do have to compromise a little.  This has a lot of bells and whistles but no flash.  By that I mean it's like getting the limited edition of a video game instead of the collectors edition.  You get most of the good stuff but there's not the wow factor.  Insert a car reference if that would make more sense to you or whatever reference you prefer.I would give this television 4.5 stars but amazon doesn't allow that.

We just happened across this 47KDE as an open box at our local Sam's club when I saw we could use the Real 3D glasses we \"forgot\" to recycle from the theater I could not pass up on the price. However for $300 I did not have very high expectations especially with Vizio's hit or miss reputation on quality.Well we've had it for about 2 months,and have spent more that the cost of the TV on 3D blu-rays ,and will waste an entire day watching the old Imax movies on 3Net. I was really upset when Disney shut down ESPN3D. You have not seen anything,until you have watched Snowboarding,Arenacross or other X-game types of sports in 3D. The 3D football was not very impressive, but having a snowboarder do a 720 and land in your lap is amazing.To be honest the only complaints I have is that there in not enough 3D programming to fully enjoy this TVs capabilities. Seems a shame to buy a new TV and only be able to fully use it for the 1 or 2 3D Blu-Rays that come out each month. Where are all those experts that when 3D TVs first came into the mainstream 5 years ago swore that all programming would be in 3D within 3-5 years ?The ATSC tuner is not the best, but it is no worse than our other OTA tuners for locking in digital OTA broadcasts. The picture quality is greatly superior compared to what we get off of cable or Directv. People that think the compressed signal they get off cable is true HiDef really need to invest in a good digital OTA antenna and see what they are missing.Only time will tell how long this TV will last, but as far as features and picture quality I am more than impressed and may need to reassess my opinion of Vizio.", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Blown away by the 3D", "Author": "Vynny \"Vynrod\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZEK3JBVYGXQD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Enough has been said about the pros and cons of this TV - extremely well written I might add and thoroughly in depth here on Amazon, so I don't see much reason to reiterate what others have said...I will add that I aside from this set I have an LG active shutter plasma 52\" P950 or something and so perhaps a comparison would help for those on the fence between plasma and LCD and active vs passive 3D glasses.Firstly though I do want to say that as with most HDTVs these days you should tweak the settings out of the box to get the best pic. Personally I stick with 'vivid' and turn off any energy saving options. I did this with my plasma and with this set as well. This does reveal probably biggest weakness of this TV and that's bleeding of the LED edge backlighting. On my particular set it's noticeable but not too horrible. In a dark room with the settings on high as previously mentioned and with something dark playing on your TV you're going to see it; it's just the nature of the beast. With plasma though you get nothing but pure black. So with that in mind it's clearly a win for plasma for black levels. Is it worth the extra for such pure blackness? No, in my opinion the extra cost combined with the increase in electricity to run the set isn't worth the price of entry (plasmas can run up to 500 watts vs a mere 100 watts for this one). Major savings on running costs and lower price overall.Also enable game mode. First time I viewed a DVD it looked like it was shot on VHS and I'm not sure why it's even there. Standard and 3D blu rays look stunning regardless of this setting.So onto to the 3D comparison. Now I really wasn't expecting it to look as good as active shutter, I mean how can those cheap two dollar plastic shades compare to battery powered LCD glasses costing $100 or more? Well the fact is they do.My \"go to\" movie is Avatar and it looks every bit as good on this set as it does on my LG plasma with active shutter. Dare I say it actually looks better? It's a close call, the picture quality is mind blowing either way and there was zero ghosting. Given that you don't have to recharge anything and the whole family can sit and watch without out laying big bucks for the glasses I really think this TV wins. Plus the glasses are more lightweight and I think the image is ever so slightly brighter. Ultimately I paid three times as much for a plasma active shutter TV and thanks to this passive LED-lit LCD TV you don't have to.So if you're after an inexpensive 3D set, one that delivers on many levels but especially on the 3d side of things then this is your man. Sure it might not have all the fancy options such as picture in picture but who ever uses that? This TV is lightweight, inexpensive to run (it's the same as a light bulb!) and the 3D is amazing.

Costco had this Vizio model on their website, for about a hundred bucks more so I bought this here on Amazon - gotta love Prime.This TV has an excellent quality picture.  The sound is horrible but that's what is to be expected from a 1\" deep tv.  We bought a Yamaha sound bar and plugged it into this TV via fiber optic cable.  Sounds excellent now.  The 3D is pretty cool.  The viewing angle is great.  It does seem to take about 20-30 seconds to boot up before you can start watching TV, which seems long but I guess it's not that bad because these TVs nowadays basically have computers in them.

I play a lot of video games and my PS3 is in the bedroom, so I wanted a bigger, LED TV to play on and to prepare for when I get a PS4 later this year. I saw a lot of good reviews, and the price was so good, that I just had to buy it. Let me tell you, I made the right choice. First off, all the reviews saying the Netflix doesn't work and the 'soap opera' effect can't be turned off are all wrong. The TV updated after I connected it to my WiFi network and all of the apps work perfectly and fairly quickly, even on my crappy DSL connection. If you go to 'menu' then 'settings' and turn 'game mode' on TADA!!! the 'soap opera' effect is gone. I also played some Assassins Creed 3 with the 3D on ( this uses passive 3D and comes with 4 pairs of glasses) and I have to admit, it was pretty cool. I also watched Wreck it Ralph in 3D and was impressed by the depth of the picture. The picture on this TV is so crisp and clean, and the colors are very vibrant. The black levels are also very good, though not near as good as more expensive local dimming led TVs. If I had one gripe, it would be that the speakers aren't very good, but they never are on flat panel TVs. This makes my old 32\" Samsung LCD look bad, very bad.

So far, I'm liking this TV. It's very easy to set up and  and not as heavy as a plasma to hang onto the wall. The thing about hanging this TV on the wall, is that you might want to attach any cables (ethernet, VGA, HDMI, Optical audio or etc... ) in the rear of the TV, before hanging it on the wall. I found it rather difficult to attach a USB flash drive to the rear of the TV USB slot, when it was hanging on the wall mount. Besides the hardware piece, this Smart TV and it's remote are really easy to use. The remote is a major plus; the reason I say that is because once I connected my PS3 to the TV... I was able use the Vizio remote to control my PS3. Same thing for the Sony Home Theater System. For the 3D portion, it took some time to figure that out. 3D > side by side (SBS) > top and bottom (TB) and the surrel 3D scensio option. Of couse, a High Speed 3D capable HDMI cable would be needed in order for the 3D to work from an external media device (like an XBOX, PS3, Roku, Blu-Ray player). However, you can still watch 3D videos from a flash drive. I could go on about the Pros of this TV, but will need to leave it up to the ones who would buy it.

This TV has received glowing reviews which is why we chose it.  Unfortunately, we're having problems with the one we just received 3 days ago and am wondering if anyone else has the same issues.  I've sent the following e-mail to Vizio with the same questions, but I thought that since all of you have this exact TV, you might be able to answer as well.  Here's the letter:Hello,We just purchased a new Vizio TV Model #M3D470KDE from [link removed] This TV had been very highly rated and we were very excited to receive it. However, when we received the TV, the box had been quite damaged in shipping. After setting up the TV, we found that the entire screen has a \"weird\" look to it. The picture is concave, like the middle section is recessing into the TV by a few inches. It looks like we're starting to go down a tunnel and that it seems to be stuck in a 2-D to 3-D mode. It is giving me a headache and making me nauseated. We're also having a problem focusing the picture so that it looks just right clarity-wise. We have manipulated all of the settings on our end to try to straighten out these issues (we have family members who are very tech oriented). I have contacted the shipper with the indication that we may need to send the TV back and file a claim with UPS. We need to do so in the next day or two. What are your thoughts on this? Have you ever heard of this \"concave\" issue? Do you think that the board could have been damaged in shipping? We're very familiar with flat-screen TVs and have never seen this feature in any TV that we've ever seen, in people's homes or in store display models. It's very strange. I'd very much appreciate if you could get back to me as soon as possible, as I need to let the seller know what's happening. Vizio has a stellar reputation and I hope that whatever happens, we'll end up with a wonderful TV. I like the fact that you're an American-based company as well. Thank you so much for your input. Sincerely, EAmazon Vizio TV owners . . . any thoughts you can share with me?  By the way, the Netflix works perfectly (I know people have had problems with this and Vizio/Netflix seem to have fixed this).  Other features work perfectly, too:  Amazon Prime, YouTube, etc.  We haven't tried the 3-D yet as we don't have a 3-D movie, so we don't know about this.  We just need to get the normal picture fine before we can deal with that.  Thank you to anyone who will take the time to give me feedback.  Truly, EUpdate:  2/15--So sad!  TV was returned today.  It is obvious that it had been damaged in shipping and had major defects, even more discovered than discussed above.  One thing I learned from this experience and I would pass on to others:  If you see obvious damage on the box, refuse the shipment.  Don't \"hope for the best\", especially on an electronic product.

They simply blamed the problem on Netflix servers and suggested I call back later both times. Unacceptable and makes me think they are aware of the issue and simply do not have a fix.She could probably live without Netflix, but the the biggest problem is the dejudder feature which as other reviewers have explained cannot be disabled.

Others have referred to it as \"soap opera\", to me it's simply not life like and looks as if the video has been sped up just slightly in motion scenes.

I guess Vizio likes to force people to watch what they think looks good.The other thing I have to say is this set suffers from the flashlighting effect really,really bad.This is very typical for Edge -Lit LED Sets in this price range.Unless you are willing to pay several hundred dollars more for a set with local dimming you will have to get used to this.Since most people do not know what to look for it may not bother them,but once they see it trust me it will bother you.Next, I will touch on the positives of this set and it did have some good things to note.This set has a really good picture after it is properly calibrated and out of the box this set is poorly calibrated. I highly recommend that you buy a set of calibration discs or have a professional come calibrate it for you.Disney has a good set called World of wonder that is reasonable.Now after this set is calibrated get ready for a very good picture with accurate color representation.The 3D was TOP NOTCH and the effect was really good we watched Imax Under the Sea 3D and saw fish extend outside the screen 6 Ft. or more and I am not exagerating this it was fantastic.The remote control works well and the menu system and set-up were a breeze.For those of you unfamiliar with the Vizio brand they make nothing.They are based in California and outsource everything to China to a company called Amtran Technologies.Some sets are assembled in Mexico.This is the main reason they have kept. costs down which has its ups and downs.From the research I have done Vizio has a failure rate around 3-4% about the same as the major competition this is good.The bad is if for some reason the set does fail outside of its warranty there can be trouble getting it repaired so I suggest you get a 2 year warranty at purchase to be on the safe side.Had it not been for Vizio leaving out the option to turn off The Smooth Motion effect and Real Cinema I would still have this set today the flash lighting was not a big deal to me.I like Vizio and hope to one day see them offer local dimming in their sets at an affordable price.I went with an LG Edge Lit 3D set instead and it too has some flash lighting,but I do not have to be forced to watch soap opera looking movies.Hope this helps in your search for a good TV Vizio makes good sets for the $$$,but make sure the set you get has the option to turn this technology off if you do not like it:P", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Vizio TV won't stream Netflix", "Author": "Judith", "ReviewID": "R19ER3AXVTGLEV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Would not stream netflix.

It lets you login to Netflix and see the movies titles but when you want to actually watch a movie the app throws a message at you to try later or try another movie. Already talked to Netflix and Vizio. Vizio says that TV has the app that Netflix made for them. Netflix says that Vizio is not tailoring the app correctly for the TV.

If you are sensitive to this (it makes every video look like a soap opera/sitcom/BBC show), then I'd stay away from this TV.  The Vizio website and tech specs site is misleading -- they indicate that the smooth motion is NOT available, but what they mean is you can't disable it.  There is some indication that the \"KD\" model (which is NOT the same as the KDE model here, the KD model has been reviewed favorably elsewhere) might have the motion smoothing setting available to disable.Some other gripes: the Amazon Prime app bugged out and we had to turn the TV off and back on again to get it working.

This was after getting a run around about unrelated issues, blaming Netflix, etc. From other forums, I learned about the firmware upgrade.Some people have reported getting the 3.12.0 upgrade, and it fixed the issue, but...So 2 weeks has passed, I have not got the upgrade, I called again (this time called the seller customer service, they got Vizio on the line - I didn't buy this through Amazon, but through a warehouse club, but this is a common issue). I was told again that new fw would be out in 1-2 weeks. I explained I was told that 2 weeks ago, but got no better story.This problem has been reported going back to 23OCT2012 - and still no resolution for many of us.For more, search on terms in the error message: \"We're having trouble playing this title right now.

Even my friend, who swears by Sony and will not purchase any other brand, said he like it. So that means a lot. The shipping took longer compared to the other tv I purchased from Amazon, that I returned btw because it was damaged inside the box, but I used the Free Shipping method and this time they did not send it out right away. It was processing about 4-5 days after I paid for it. But once it shipped it was here within 2 days. This time instead of using UPS Amazon sent it through FedEx so idk if that made a difference but the tv was handled properly and this time I didn't receive a busted item.Ok now for the review of the actual tv. The picture quality is very nice, the \"soap opera effect\" or TruMotion is not too bad and can be turned off by changing it to game mode, the sound is exceptional even without my home theatre system set up and the look of the set is very sleek, thin and modern compared to the 42\" Vizio I purchased to week ago that was kind of bulky looking to me.Now setting up the wireless was straight forward and simple no complaints and it took less than a minute. Setting up Netflix and Hulu Plus was a breeze. Just following the simple instructions will be all anyone needs because all you have to do is log on to your accounts on your PC/Mac and put in the activation code that you see on the tv screen and viola no logging in with username and password twice. I love the Netflix button at the top of the remote and I think the keyboard on the back is genius. It will make life so simple. But there's no button for Hulu so you have to get to it by pressing the home key in the middle of the remote and using the direction pad to get to the app of your choice which isn't too bad and I don't find it too slow. I haven't used the 3D but there is a button that you can press on the remote so it seems like it would be simple enough to use.The reason this tv has 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the time it takes to go between channels. No idk if it's because I have Fios or what, but whenever I go to the guide and search for a station to watch and press the enter button it takes like 4 secs to switch to the channel. If I'm just scrolling using the channel button it's faster but going to the guide seems to take a while for it to get the channel loaded. Also maybe I read the description wrong but I thought this tv had automatic dimming but I couldn't find it in the settings but that's not a deal breaker just wanted to throw that out there. The only thing that would make this set even better is if it had 2D-3D conversion but I knew it didn't so I'm not complaining and I checked out the on demand for Verizon and they offer 3D movies and it didn't seem expensive compared to the reg HD movies that you pay for. This set does not have a browser so if you want that feature don't get it I don't care for using my TV as a computer so this doesn't bother me because I have my Mac and Iphone.All in all I like the TV so far and will update this review as time progresses. This is a great buy for anyone who wants the features of a smart tv without having to hook your Mac up to it to watch Netflix, Hulu ect... and if you want to save money.

If you're looking to use it as a dumb monitor, it's fantastic.However, the remote is not capable (so far as I can tell) of controlling any other devices at all.

This is very strange because I can connect and see my queue, but the movies will not download.All of the other services work (Amazon, Hulu) and I have another Vizio TV and 2 Sony DVD players and they all work w/o problems so it has to be this TV.Since I am able to access Netflix with the DVD player I am going to keep this -- hoping that they will eventually get enough complaints that they fix it.Hopefully someone from Vizio will read these reviews and see that there is a major problem with their customer \"service\" plan. My major issue is that you MUST register with them before you can talk to a tech. This involves getting serial number and giving them all kinds of personal information that has nothing to do with the problem (eg. where purchased and for how much). I am calling to report a problem and they want to collect marketing information. Not a good plan. The first agent hung up on me when I told him that the serial number was too small to read. The second agent (a supervisor) argued with me about this and was even more of a jerk than the first. After an hour on the phone (40 mins of registering) the problem was still not resolved.The TV itself is excellent. The colors are bright and I was OK with the price and feel it was worth the extra money to get the LED version over the LCD.So, buyer beware.Update: 11/18/12The problem downloading from Netflix is still not resolved:After troubleshooting with Netflix to ensure it wasn't something at their end I submitted a detailed report of what I had done to trouble shoot the problem to Vizio online. I included the case number from the original call.The agent responded with boilerplate on how to reset the device to factory settings. He did not bother to read what I had written or review the case. Then I received a stern email from Vizio Customer support that stated I needed to respond in 168 hours if my issue has not been resolved.As for giving this product one star \"because I didn't want to give them a serial number\". That is not the issue. The calls are answered by call center employees that will not pass your call to a technician until you have provided a long list of information -- information which has nothing to do with resolving your problem. Your name, a call back number and the model number should be sufficient to get a technician to help solve your problem.The device still does not work. I have not received any assurance from Vizio that they are even interested in the solving problem.I stand by my one star review.", "Date": "November 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Vizio 47\" M-Series 3D TV Model #M3D47OKDE", "Author": "Edwin W.", "ReviewID": "R2W382JUD607HC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just purchased the Vizio M3D47OKDE 47\" 1080p 120Hz Razor LED Smart 3D HDTV thinking I would be able to watch any TV program in 3D.
