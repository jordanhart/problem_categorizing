{"Reviews": [{"Title": "22 inch keeps pace!", "Author": "LadyHawke9973 \"LadyHawke\"", "ReviewID": "R1OA1F4GP5Z3F3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the 22 inch version of this model line (Samsung LN-22A330) for my bedroom, and am VERY impressed. The picture quality is fantastic, and it has settings where you can fine tune the settings for individual channels.I have it on every morning for the news while I'm getting ready for work, and every night as I wind down and fall asleep (very appreciative of the person who first installed sleep timers on TVs).I like everything about this unit, including the \"tools\" function on the remote for the most-used items in my house (including the sleep functions).  There are \"fun\" settings, too...where you can choose not only your energy savings level, but also what type of image you're watching...a \"movie\" versus reg tv....it deepens the color beautifully without actually changing the colors.The only item I find disconcerting is the sheer amount of time it takes to respond to turning the unit 'on'. Once you hit Power, just ignore it and ...................................................THEN you'll hear the tones turning it on (tones may be set at different volumes and even turned off if you poke around in the menu long enough to find it).Given time, I'll certainly get used to the amount of time it is, but for now it's bothersome as there is no other indicator that you actually hit the button correctly (the light on the power button on the tv doesn't flash at first, nothing).If I needed to replace this 22\" unit for some reason, I'd buy the same model again in a heartbeat.  Very pleased with Samsung's 330 line.  Excellent value for the price for a bedroom tv.", "Date": "July 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Value", "Author": "Dave in Connecticut", "ReviewID": "R2Y77JBCJ251AP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I gave it 4 stars only because something has to be absolutely spectacular for me to give it 5 stars. Pretty much anything good that has been said about the set is true. I do have to take exception with the comments that it takes a long time to turn on. I took a stopwatch to it with the following results. From the time I pressed the power button it took 2.5 seconds for the \"welcome tune\" and about 9 seconds to deliver a picture. I expect that most people can live with that. I have two Sony Bravia sets that take about the same amount of time to start up. Overall, it's a very good set and a solid value.", "Date": "July 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Thanks for the prior reviews", "Author": "S.

Having read many previous reviews criticizing the sound quality and/or volume, I was apprehensive but finally decided to try it out.  So glad I did!  It's only been hooked up for a few hours, but I'm thoroughly pleased (and I'm watching/listening from nearly 20' away!  And the volume isn't even 1/4 of capacity.  (As far as being 20' away, that's *not* my usual TV-watching distance, but right now I'm in the dining room and looking into the living room where the TV is positioned to face me, and I'm impressed.)  There are a couple of things I'd tweak on the remote, including adding backlighting, but really this is not a complaint.", "Date": "October 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "great t.v", "Author": "Daniel Zeitler \"SomeRandomGuy\"", "ReviewID": "R2RKUA99EV1PZ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "t.v works great. lots of plug ins for audio and video, hmdi input and laptop input are a plus.pros-720p3,000-1 constrast/dynamic contrast ratiovivid color and sharpnessbuilt like a samsungcons-built in speakers kind of suck but come on get surround sound!kind of pricey for a 22 inch but after using it for this long i cant really complain.", "Date": "July 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "SOUND QUALITY IS HURTING THIS PRODUCT", "Author": "North Carolina", "ReviewID": "RG4MUSQHIWVP0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just purchased a Samsung LN22A330 22-inch LCD TV.  As other reviewers noted, the sound quality is poor, no, make that annoying!  If you raise the volume more than 30%, the low tones start to rattle and garble.  Not a good feature for Samsung.  I'm definitely disappointed with the poor sound quality; will probably have to attach speakers to it for decent sound projection.

I have been researching the 22 inch 720p 330 and 450 models of the samsung tv.  Both are the same price and both have great reviews.  The higher model (touch of color) is around the same price but the reviews are not nearly as good as both of the 330 and 450.  Does anyone know which is better for the money?  They both look great (pretty much the same) and both have the complaint of the sound but that is about it!
