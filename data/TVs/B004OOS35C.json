The LD550 has better features than the LK520 -- its internet application was one thing that attracted me, but it requires an adapter which doesn't come with the TV, so I never got to test it. I guess I don't need this feature anyway,  so I returned it and bought the 47\" LK520, at the same price --- it was on sale on Amazon for about 7 hundred.The shipping:This model came out in March 2011, and I placed the order in April. I guess because it is relatively new, so I had to wait 4-6 weeks for the product to be shipped.So after waiting patiently for over one month, my TV finally came. I was expecting the guys from the shipping company to open the box and let me check the TV, just like what they did when I bought the other LG model. I was surprised when they told me they couldn't open the box, and that I should open it on my own, and keep the box for a year in case I need to return it. This sounds a little weird, but I signed the delivery sheet anyway.The assembling:It only took a few minutes to assemble this TV. My brother and I laid the panel on my sofa bed with the screen facing down, and secured the base/stand with a few screws. It looks like the stand was made of some cheap plastic. I hope it's more sturdy than it looks.The look:This TV has a simple, sophisticate design. I like the matt screen and the glossy black frame. There's a small blue light on the lower right corner when the TV is on. Althought the remote control is easy to use, the design looks boring and cheap, some buttons/features seem like a duplicate to me. But I guess it's not a big deal, as long as it works.Sound quality:There are several sound modes you can choose from. It was set to \"standard\" by default, and the volume was low,  but it was much better once I switched it to \"music\" or \"cimema\". I also turned on the \"surround sound\" feature. Over all I am happy with the sound quality.Picture quality:I've had this TV for about two weeks now, at first I was impressed with the picture quality -- it's crisp and clear, and the color looks very nice, just like the LD550 model. I set the picture mode to \"Cinema\" --the \"standard\" mode is a bit too bright for my sensitive eyes. Of course you can create and save your own picture mode by adjusting the brightness, color, and contrast, etc.  But one day I noticed the brightness on the TV screen changed suddenly --- it went darker,  then after a while it went bright again (looks similar to when there are rolling clouds in the sky on a sunny day).  I didn't turn on the \"inteligent sensor\" and I think the lighting in my room didn't change. I did not have this problem with the LD550 model. I am not sure if I got a defective item or what.  Right now I give this TV a 4 star, and hoping there's an easy fix for the brightness problem. I'll test it for a few more days and decide whether I should call LG, or return it....*** UPDATE: I found out the reason that my TV would suddenly go darker is because I had the \"Engergy Saver\" on (it was set to \"Auto\"). So whenever the sensor in the TV detects a change of lighting in the room, it'll adjust the screen brightness automatically. Sometimes the screen goes so dark I can hardly see. I am not sure how much energy it can save by doing this, but I find it annoying to me, so I turned the feature off, and the problem solved! I am glad I don't have to return this TV. I am happy with my purchase so far.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV", "Author": "rkay48", "ReviewID": "R3RLKTGHCJ9JLP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this TV for only a few days, but it appears to be exactly what I wanted.  The LK520 LG model is very similar to the earlier model LD520 (highly rated), except that the dynamic contrast is apparently a bit better for the LK520(150K to 1 vs 100K), but I suspect that may not be that significant.INPUT-OUTPUTIt has sufficient inputs (HDMI, component, etc), and outputs, although I still wish these new HDTVs had a regular stereo output (ie., 2 RF outputs) so I could use them with my old amplifier. The LK520 only has 1 optical digital audio output.  However, the sound from the LK520 speakers is surprisingly robust, although most will probably want more to complete the home theater experience.  The LK520 also has a USB port, but I have not used this yet. The specs say you can connect your external USB devices for JPEG photos or MP3 files. (Note, this model does NOT have any internet connection capabilities--however you could hook this up to a BluRay DVD player that has this capability, if you want it).I hooked up my cable box via an HDMI cord, and the LK520 provides a clear HD picture and does well with regular SD channels also.  I hooked up the TV with component inputs from my oldish DVD player, and it looked very good.  (Some day I will get a BluRay, so I can see more pores, I guess, on close ups...).FEATURESThe LK520 has 120 Hz, so if you watch a lot of sports, this might be important (I don't).  So maybe the 60 Hz LG LK450 might be OK for you, and save you 60-80$. However, note that the LK520 has a slightly higher dynamic contrast compared to the 60 Hz 42 inch LG LK450 (150K vs 100K).The weight is only about 35 lbs, so it is relatively easy (if a bit awkward) to carry around. Also, the screen does not seem to have any serious reflection problems in stronger lighting situations.The TV picture can be adjusted to your preferences, but I found the default settings good enough for me.  It is Energy Star rated, which is good, but I found the \"intelligent sensor\" adjustments a bit too dark for me.  However, you can adjust this as your wish.SUMMARY:  I don't think you can go wrong with this excellent LG HDTV. I would rate it at 4.5 stars. Some minor limitations on audio output and the somewhat high price that I paid at a big box store (BB) made me give it a 4 instead of 5.I may update this if I find any problems later....", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "PERFECT!!", "Author": "KJcool", "ReviewID": "RJGRVT3TB5LEO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "skip intro and specs because you guys can find those anywhere onlinei read through all the reviews before i bought this TV and it helped a lot. Hopefully this would help as well.Some features are tested and here is the quick review:-120HZ TruMotion works perfectly, way better than 60HZ and other 120HZ TVs, PS3 (black-ops and Top Spin 4) and 3 1080P videos (scene,sports and concert) tested.2.4ms response time makes everything so smooth.-REALLY Stunning picture, color depth-good, brightness-good, high contrast 150,000:1 (12 HD pictures tested, each of them was at least 15 MB)-SOUND quality is better than i thought. APE format music tested (classical, rock concert, heavy metal, R&B; and Pop) I thought it was gonna be the only weakness for this TV because 80% LCD TVs having bad sound quality. But it turned out that the Invisible Speakers worked pretty well, extra speakers are not needed for bedroom use unless you want to get extremely HD sound-Easy to set up. UI friendly.-HDMI works. PC-INPUT works. USB works. BTW, that USB UI is great!-Price: $659 on amazon was even cheaper than $669+tax at WalMart. two days shipping as guaranteed as always.GREAT deal over all.

The exception were some of the PANASONIC plasmas, but they were out of my budget anyway.My budget was about $600-$800 and I decided on LCD over Plasma. Didn't consider LED for it's higher price range.I wanted it to be 120hz and have the best possible picture quality.I was set to get the Samsung LN46C630, then this LG grabbed my attention. Bear in mind I was limiting myself to the lower end models that don't have all the extra features I would not care to have.LUCKLY, one fo the stores I went to have these 2 TV's side-by-side!And it was a VERY close call, sometime I found the LG to have better picture, sometimes the SAMSUNG. I was impressed that LG as a brand would stand up to Samsung.Please do understand comparing in stores is a great way to do this, but not completely reliable as TV's would have different calibration settings (or lack of) and generally they have a store-demo mode which makes the picture look bright and stuff to draw attention to itself.Then I found a smoking deal on the LG, which made it very easy to decide.I could have gone either way and been happy.", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't believe the reviews.", "Author": "Wolfmanatee", "ReviewID": "R2C9TTSGMHITW2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The average review on Amazon for this TV model (LK520) is in the upper 4 star range...  and that is absolutely insane. I'd like to provide a different perspective.PICTUREThe screens suffer from the dirty screen effect where white backgrounds show visible gradients that are not part of the intended visual experience but rather a side effect of a cheap panel. Unsuitable for gaming, especially on XBOX. There is a significant amount of motion blurring in fast-paced games like BLACK OPS and DEUS EX whenever the field of view is shifted (impossible to read text on walls when turning your character, for example). PS3 games ran better, but the motion blur was still present regardless of setting combinations for the TV's display configurations. Static, unmoving images during movies look great--but when the characters start moving, or especially when the camera pans, you will notice quite a bit of judder and blur even with the anti-judder and anti-blur settings cranked all the way up to 10.AUDIOAbout what you'd expect for a budget-priced LCD TV. In other words, inferior to most built-in speakers in CRT/Tube TVs. CINEMA mode significantly increased the quality of the sound, however, making it so-so in quality.OTHERPlease note that the TV's stand is absolutely terrible. The TV is anything but stable, and I can't recommend this TV to anyone if you don't plan on mounting it on a wall as the stand wobbles quite a bit (see youtube videos for demonstrations). The menu/interface for the TV was actually very well done--I hope that whatever TV I end up with permanently handles the features and settings so fluidly.NOTESWith LCD TVs, you always get what you pay for. The BRAVIA line, for example, is vastly superior--I set this LG model up next to my brother's Bravia and the difference in image quality was staggering (which makes sense, considering that model runs for about 200-300 more than this LG model). Gaming especially was worlds apart. Additionally, these models are subject to the panel lottery--where you will get one of three LCD panels of varying quality. In other words, you may just end up with a version of this model that's comparatively inferior to other LK520s.MY EXPERIENCEUPS broke the first TV, but Amazon's customer service was excellent--they had a second TV on my doorstep two days later. I recently returned the second one after extensive tuning/testing/comparisons with other TVs and Amazon did a great job with paying for shipping back out to them. Amazon gets five stars, UPS gets one star, this TV gets three stars.I can't recommend this TV. Listen--even in its price range, this LCD is about average. If you don't really care about movie quality and you just want a big-ish TV that you can watch standard cable TV on, go for it. But for anyone who plays games, cares about image/picture quality on DVDs/Blu-Rays, you will want to jump up a price range or two.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Entering the 21st century - finally", "Author": "Cassandra.", "ReviewID": "R1I144YKXXWTBX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This LG 42LK520 is replacing my well-loved Toshiba CRT tv (which, to my dismay, refused to age or give any sign it was ready to quit and justify my purchase), so I can't claim great sophistication when it comes to comparing modern, flat-panel TVs.Having said that, I couldn't be happier with this LG. The image is crisp and true. The color saturation on the default setting is perhaps a touch brighter than life - which I'm sure can be manipulated easily, but I rather like seeing the world with bright green grass and impossibly blue sky, so I haven't bothered. The trumotion works well and so far I have seen no after-image or blur. The sound quality is good, but not great, but it matters little to me as I run it through my fairly old home theatre system which makes the whole experience  quite wonderful. I even like the subtle light that glows on the lower right corner and turns from red to blue when you turn the tv on - totally unrelated to the tv's performance, but it's just cool and makes the tv look expensive.  I am enjoying this TV tremendously, and sometimes will turn it on just to look at how nice the picture is.For about $650 with free shipping, how could I not be happy? Shipping was impressively quick. Set up was relatively easy, though the installation manual is so simple as to be relatively useless. Incidentally, if you're hooking it up to your satellite receiver, you have to press \"input\" on your remote and then select \"HDMI\" - the instruction manual doesn't tell you this.None of the minor weaknesses (like the sound - which isn't bad, it just didn't blow me away) are signficant enough to drop it out of five-star range.  At this price point this TV provides incredible value.

I spent a good amount of time looking online for the best bargain and probably set my expectations quite high.  I decided to go with a brand that I've always known and trusted.  LG did not let me down.The giant viewing area of the screen provides a beautiful, sharp picture.  I notice no lag or ghosting at all watching through Verizon FIOS, a standard DVD player, or an XBox 360.  I've yet to hook a blu-ray player up, but completely look forward to doing so.  The sound quality is outstanding, I typically leave it at about 20% of it's max, and it's plenty loud enough to hear across the room.  Even cranked up, there's no hum or static from the speakers and the sound quality is good.As for features, I decided on price over some of the cooler potential features.  This TV is NOT 3D compatible.  It doesn't have Netflix or any of that.  Keeping that stuff off, however, keeps the price very reasonable.  In addition, the USB port accepts a USB device and seems to play most movie formats, image formats, and music formats that I've been able to plug into it.I would have no qualms recommending this product to a friend, and have no regrets for buying it.

It hooks up to a computer via an HDMI cable very easily and produces a terrific picture with no overscan.

We have been using this TV for three days only, so our experience is limited, but I am pretty happy with the purchase.First, delivery was very fast.  I chose the free Super Saver shipping option (5-8 business days), but the TV was delivered in 3 days.The picture quality is great.  Watching Blu-Ray and DVD movies through an HDMI cable on this LG TV is nothing short of amazing.  Since we had CRT TVs, we had no need for HDTV channels.  However, we may have to upgrade our cable TV service to the HD package.  The quality of the movies might be spoiling us a bit.Sound quality is OK.  To get the full movie experience an external speaker system is needed, but the built-in speakers do an adequate job.The only negative with this TV is the stand.  The stand comes in two parts.  The base unit is plastic with a metal core.  The second part is an adapter that mounts to the TV and the base unit.  This second part is plastic.  When assembled, the stand is not very sturdy.

I did a lot of research before purchasing an LCD HDTV, and I'm glad I went with the LK520.I was looking for a quality 120Hz LCD HDTV in the 42\" class with good display adjustments and without clunky \"smart\" features.  That's exactly what I've found in the LG 42LK520, and I'm very pleased.I'm a photographer and Photoshop enthusiast, and I've done quite a bit of color and contrast calibration.  The picture from my LG 42LK520 is very good, and in addition to several preset modes, you can get very detailed in the fine tuning.  In particular it's worth your time to adjust the Black Level setting.I'm also very pleased with the different \"aspect\" modes, and the \"Just Scan\" feature.  I purchased this HDTV in part because of its 120Hz display, but I'm also very pleased that it's easy to turn off.I intentionally wanted to avoid the new generation of \"smart\" features.  I've heard too many horror stories of HDTVs that take 15 minutes to boot, reboot themselves at random, or take 60 seconds to bring up a menu.  I don't need a TV that streams its own content, there are 5 Netflix capable sources plugged in to my display already!Pros: Great picture and fine tuning controls. 120Hz display, and \"Just Scan\" mode for gaming. Outstanding 2.4ms response time. Very intuitive and professional feeling menus / UI. No stupid \"smart\" features. Good price for its class.Cons: I wish I'd bought the larger one.

I turned on the cable first and after shutting off energy save and adjusting picture controls,i was extremely dissapointed. I spent hours adjusting settings and looking up TV issues to no avail.Some channels looked just ok but others were unwatchable. I put in a DVD and was not that impressed,again just ok.I purchased this through amazon but i seen it first in a store and loved the picture. I was going to return it but decided to go to the store and ask questions.I told them what TV i had and the two salesman said it was a top of the line model and i should not be having those issues.They explained the HDMI cable provide by the cable company was below average for this type of TV,they said \"it was like sucking milk through a coffee straw\" the cable cant get all the info to the tv in time.Also the old DVD players dont have 1080 upscalling and i needed to connect another HDMI cable.I found HDMI cables on amazon with high ratings and low price (mediabridge),i also purchased a DVD player with 1080 upscalling,all for less then $100 bucks. So now the moment of truth,i had been watchiing this TV for four days before my cables arrived.I hooked everything up and turned on the TV and OH MY GOD! Blown away.The picture is more then awesome,i could see why alot of movie stars didnt like HD, you can see a drop of sweat as if you were standing next to someone. When i played a movie Gladiator i could not stop watching until it was over.The sound is good enough and loud enough where you dont have to run out and get a stereo system.If you hook this up right you will love it.There is a lot of adjusting thought to get the right colors and skin tone.if anyone is interested i could tel you my settings and you can go from there.my settings are to match the closest skin tones so the people look real.So my advice. get HDMI cables (mediabridge)or one with high ratings for everything you connect to the TV. Upgrade your DVD player (if you want the full picture quaility) to 1080 upscalling wich converts the older movies to 1080 while playing. turn off tru motion and energy saver.

I had no problems setting up the TV with the rest of my entertainment system (a sound bar and some gaming systems).Only 2 issues have ever come up:1. Assembling the stand at first was a bit tricky. You have to prop up the face of the TV on some pillows or something to elevate it enough to attach the stand at the bottom since it juts out a bit at the front. A mild inconvenience.2. Review the default settings and make sure to turn off the power-save feature. Otherwise there is a sensor that detects light in the room and it will dim the TV as it gets darker to save power. Maybe there is a way to control just how much it will dim, but I prefer a consistent picture.

Excellent picture quality.  It was good out of the box, and I just finished the Disney calibration, and it's even better, now.  Lighting is even edge-to-edge and corner-to-corner, edges are sharp without jaggies.B.  Very good audio.  We went with the CFL backlighting rather than the LED/LCD because CFL sets tend to have a little more room for internal speakers and therefore, directionally better sound.  This set has good internal speakers and sounds great.The whole plasma/LCD universe is short-term technology, and will be replaced by significantly better technology a long time before the parts in these TV's begin to wear out, so we set a realistic price point and got a much better set than we hoped.It was slightly trickier to assemble the pedestal to the set than it needed to be, but it wasn't hard; just not obvious.  The manual is for about 20 models, and the illustrations weren't all that easy to see.  Still, it only took a couple of head-scratches to figure it out.As much of a geek as I am, it's surprising that this is the first large-screen HDTV we own.  The 30+ year old CRT's work perfectly well, but when the local channels went digital, they also went hi-definition.  I got tired of seeing the center one-half of the shows and bit the bullet.We're casual users, and I take one exception to the advice I received when shopping: don't go by the \"How big a TV do you need\" charts or advice.  I went by \"How tall is the CRT screen I'm replacing?\" method and matched that dimension as close as possible.  It's still bigger than we really need, but I'm not trading it in.If, like me, you're just venturing into HDTV, you can't go wrong here.  The next one I buy may be fancier, but this is a whole lot of TV for the dollar.UPDATE (JULY 11, 2011):The HDMI ports failed.  I doubt this is the televison's fault or LG's fault.  This sat in a dark brown truck for 12 hours on a 108-degree day, and was hot to the touch when we opened the box.  It started-up fine and had the great image quality we all talk about, but yesterday, it started to pixellate, and today it won't recognize any device connected through HDMI.It's sad, but like I said: I don't think this is a reflection of the TV's quality, and I will not lower my 5-star rating.In fact, I wouldn't mention it except I just went through the Amazon.com return policy, and they'll take it back, but I had to pay for shipping, insurance and pick-up (it's too big to fit in the car): $70.  Wow!It wasn't sent by a specialy shipper - I see that there are special conditions for returning those items.  Maybe it's because we're returning it and not asking for a replacement at this time.  Why roast another one in the back of a truck?

I bought this TV for my college dorm room, I was originally worried that a 42\" might be too big (having originally gone with a 32\") but I think this is right at the limit.What I Like:---Screen; Bigger really is better, at 42 inches you can sit further away while getting the same viewing experience.  Despite being \"only and LCD\" the screen is exceptionally bright.---Light Sensor; On the lower right corner of the bezel is a light sensor.  Its a great little feature, all you have to do is change picture mode to \"intelligent sensor\" and it actively adjusts the screen's brightness to match light in the room.  In the grand scheme of things this is a small feature but I find it very useful because we (roommate and I) watch a lot of TV at night so it saves our eyes.---Sound; the speakers (as with most TV's) aren't anything to brag about but can do OK.  I already had a 120W Panasonic Stereo with the appropriate cable so I've been running the sound through that.---Design; this is more broad and more subjective than the other categories.  First the indicator light, some people complain that they can interfere with viewing.  LG decided on a unique \"corner light\" for this TV (literally, its a backwards \"L\") and I can say its a good choice.  Its discrete enough while you're watching but still visible enough to give you user feedback when you press a button on the remote.  The bezel on this TV is about 2\" and has an interesting thin red outline that runs perpendicular to the viewing angle but is just barely noticeable.  Not necessary at all but it does give the TV an interesting look. It seems to separate the TV from the wall even further, almost like a pop effect rather than direct contrast (black on white).---Value; This TV offers a lot for the $550 range price tag (I paid $551.99 on 8/23/11).  I did extensive research and comparisons before I bought my first TV.  I thought $350 for the 32\" Vizio was a great deal so I was skeptical about coughing up an extra 200 but it was worth every penny.I would write what I don't like but I'm hard pressed to find something.  But hopefully I've written something useful for you that's not in LG's description.Bottom Line: I wasn't sure about LG since I consider them a newer TV brand, I still don't see their TV's much these days.  But needless to say they've built a great 1st TV for me and I'm very satisfied.

Since the 42LE5300 was then out of stock everywhere, I compared the tvs mentioned in the title.With default settings, the 42LE5400 looked much better.  I left the 42LE5400 at default settings and tweaked the 42LK520 to match.  I was amazed at how close I got the two tvs to look.  As they were right next to each other, the LED had a little better contrast, but again, they were super close.  Speakers were about the same.  Both bezels, and packages looked and assembled great.  The 42LE5400 had a little better off angle too, but not until 30 to 40 degrees from center.I found the internet connectivity on the 42LE5400 to be more cumbersome than it was worth.  And our internet would be way to slow to even try Netflix.  So I was bummed I hadn't actually got the 42LE5300.  But I liked the remote on the 42LK520 better, and it was nice not having the extra complexity of internet stuff in the menus.Even though the 42LE5400 was 800 dollars and the 42LK520 was 668 dollars, both from Walmart, I went with the LED tv.  Besides the slight edge bleeding from edge-lit LED, and my opinion of the useless internet connectivity, I thought the picture was just slightly better.  I mean, I could have gotten a blu-ray player with the LK for the same price.  The fact the LE5400 was marked down and the LK520 was regular price also could have played into my bargain purchasing mentality.But the 42LK520 is a GREAT tv for the price.

There are TVs that perform better than this, but I believe you need to pay several hundred dollars more.  This panel display blacks as very dark over all areas of the screen.  The contrast of various levels of black could be better, but compares favorably with other TVs at this price point.Colors are very vibrant and bright.  Note that the default picture setting is overly bright with the color being too `hot'.  Before I took the time to fine tune the picture, I simply moved to the stock `Cinema' mode and bumped up the brightness a bit for a solid general-use picture.  This display performs very well with XBox games over HDMI.The side-viewing angle is a bit less here than other models, but is definitely adequate for my room.  The matte screen has very low reflectivity so is excellent for bright rooms.As mentioned in other reviews, there is a piece of thin red trim around the outer edge of the bezel.  I don't feel this improves the appearance of the bezel, but is only noticeable from the side.The mounting bracket supplied by my TV stand, Z-Line Vitoria Flat Panel TV Stand, blocks access to the rear component video inputs.  I don't know whether this is caused by a non-standard mount, or the TV's placement of the inputs.  The HDMI and VGA inputs are fully accessible.I personally find no reason to own the gimmicks found on more expensive televisions.  3D may be cool for the rare movie that implements it nicely, but ask yourself how often are you going to want to sit around with glasses on.

Turn it on Low for normal TV, and High for sports and other fast-moving scenes.The remote is plain, but does its job well - the buttons are solid and the whole thing is well-constructed.. It's a TV remote control, not a work of art, and it comes batteries included. That is enough for me, haha.The main seller for me? USB connection. If you want to play things from your computer on your TV, but don't want to mess around with cables and configurations and such, just drag and drop the file onto a USB drive or key, stick it in the side, and use the extraordinarily well-designed and intuitive media player (great 10-foot design here from LG, big congratulations).That said, if you want to connect your computer, or anything else, it has VGA, a standard computer audio in, DVI, plenty of HDMI, component, RGB, digital audio out for the best quality, and a headphone jack, which is becoming less common these days.The screen is beautiful, no glare (I have this set up next to a large floor-to-ceiling window that gets full morning sun, and watched the news this morning no trouble) and the bezel has a red trim running along the very edge that I thought added a touch of LG class :) Not to mention it comes with a free cleaning cloth.The onboard speakers are great, I'm no audiophile but I can't see a need for external speakers unless you wanted to rig up an elaborate Dolby system or something. It has an interesting feature called ClearVoice II that somehow detects sounds at the frequency of the human voice and amplifies them, which is great I think, as oftentimes voices can blend in with music or other noise onscreen.All in all, this TV is everything you want, and more.

Insignia (model NS-46E790A12) for this TV.At the time of this review, both TV's were priced at $649.  The picture quality of the LG LCD is exponentially better than the aforementioned Insignia LED.The picture wizard is a breeze for calibrating the settings, and I really can't say enough about how beautiful, and crisp the picture quality is on this television.We went in to Best Buy with the intent of purchasing this television initially, but opted for the insignia because it was larger, and had newer (LED) technology.  After setting the Insignia TV up at home, and spending a ton of time tweaking the settings (using THX optimizer, etc.) the picture quality just felt like it was lacking.  It seemed a little washed out, and the picture just wasn't as vivid, and crisp as we had imagined it should be.We boxed it back up, and exchanged it for the LG, and every single expectation was exceeded with respect to picture quality.  We had purchased a Boston Acoustics sound bar with the Insignia, and hooked it up right away with the LG so I can't really comment on the sound quality of the TV alone.I've seen a few complaints about the stand--I haven't experienced any abnormal sloppiness, or flimsiness with the stand, and the fact that it swivels is a bonus as it accomodates the seating in our living room nicely.All together-- (based on my first impressions) I have no complaints whatsoever about this TV. Easy set-up, very nice interface/menus, picture wizard is intuitive, and works fantastically, and the picture is flawless.If you are in the market for a new TV, the 42LK520 is a fantastic option.

I wanted to build my own home theater center and succeeded with this TV! I have this big boy hooked up to SOOO MANY THINGS!For starters, I have the HD cable box on it, Sony home theater surround sound system, Sony Blu-ray and DVD player, also a Sony VHS/DVD player combo, Sony PS1, PS2 & PS3, Sony PSP 2000 through a component cable. More items include: Microsoft Xbox and an Xbox 360, Nintendo NES, Super Nintendo SNES, N64, Nintendo GameCube, Wii. More include: Sega master system, genesis, Sega cd, 32X, Saturn, Dreamcast, JVC X-eye and finally my laptop. With all that said, I have an audio/video switch box, component video switchbox and a HDMI switchbox.Clearly I need a lot of inputs and the TV does deliver at least 2 sets of each input for performance and convenience but I stepped it up a notch to make it even more convenient. The remote to this TV is easy to navigate through other inputs as well.The TV's quality on each and every system is great! HD and true-motion on this TV looks SUPER SWEET! Clarity on the old school systems are at a decent  to above average quality, considering HD wasn't a factor back then, but NES and Genesis to me on this TV look great! Normal 4:3 or wide/stretch 16:9 ratios with the old gaming systems look great as well.Switching between inputs is fast, and the TV's performance has little-to-none ghosting on cable TV. Also being able to control and even disable the TV's energy saving sensor is great. Even though that feature is useless to me, but great to have in case, it's good that you can turn it off. It does become in an inconvenience when the TV has a mind of its own and starts dimming the picture A LOT. So I deactivated that feature entirely.Sound on this TV is good stand alone. It could use a little more but for what it is, it's great. If you have this TV hooked up to surround sound, then you should be fine, I use mine more than the regular TV speaker itself. One thing that bothers me is having the TV's speaker high up and your surround sound on with it at the same time. There is a delay in sound and you can hear an echo with it. I have fixed this by lowering the TV's volume to about level 10 or 9, and jack up the surround sound system a lot. So no biggie here... NOTE: the surround sound is connected with an audio optical cable. I'm sure there are other ways to actually fix/calibrate this, rather than do it the way I did, but for now I am satisfied.Overall this TV delivers great and amazing results. I would recommend this to anyone. The quality and clarity of DVDs and Blu-ray discs on this TV are so great; it might as well be a 3D TV. Anyone who is a hardcore video gamer like me, I love this TV and would definitely recommend this TV for old and new school video game systems. For anyone looking for just cable tv, it is great!

With that said, I should know all of the differences available when shopping around for a TV and I should have done a bit more research for my particular needs.  I knew an LCD with LED backlighting is what I prefer but the amazing reviews on this LCD (with standard fluorescent lighting) convinced me otherwise.  I should have gone with my gut feeling on an LED screen instead and I'll tell you why in a bit.2)  I received the TV yesterday.  I can't speak highly enough about Amazon's handling of my order.  It was the first time I ever purchased an item this large (or expensive) even though I have easily spent THOUSANDS on Amazon.com over the last few years.  It arrived promptly (I ordered on Friday, received on Tuesday with FREE SHIPPING) and in excellent NEW condition.  I unboxed it and took about 10-15 minutes to set it up.  It was very easy -- the Picture Wizard setting made it a breeze and having prior experience with my room mates LG tv,  these settings were really a breeze for me.  I adjusted them for the most true-to-life picture, or so I thought (more on that in a bit).  The TV itself is few-frills but has ample settings and a simple and very easy to navigate interface.  I set it to my liking and immediately tried out cable, a blu ray and even a PS3 game.3)  The outcome was as follows:  This set produces a VERY clear picture.  It is vibrant and bright with its great contrast ratio and I didn't have any issues with black levels as some people here have mentioned.  So why am I giving it only 2 stars?  Color accuracy.  My room mates have a nearly identical set that is LED backlit and the difference in color reproduction is NIGHT AND DAY.  I really convinced myself that the difference between LCD and LED was minimal, since they are both technically different types of LCD with different methods of lighting.  Let me assure you that THERE IS A CLEAR DIFFERENCE and I have seen it with my own eyes.  I have decided to return this TV because I found the colors not only inaccurate, but also plagued by a yellow highlight effect, particularly noticeable when looking at lighter skin tones.  The whites also seem off-white and this set sufferers from what is commonly referred to as the \"dirty screen\" effect. In other words, areas that are intended to be flat/bright white actually appear to have artifacts or a sort of 'dingy' attribute that is not intended.  Also, rright fades from one light color to another [darker] variation often reveal a gradient effect that is unintended and it really takes away from the viewing experience.Overall, my thoughts are as follows:  This is a great set for someone who doesn't know what to look for.  The screen is clear, vibrant and offers clarity that is above average in its price range.  The sound is decent, which is something most modern flatscreens are missing and the settings are more than enough for a day to day user who doesn't require too much tweaking.  The TV seems well made and though some have complained about the shaky stand, I can assure you this is how almost all modern flatscreens are constructed so good luck finding something better.  If I weren't me - and didn't know what I know or have seen what i've seen in my line of work, my complaint might seem invalid and this set would be worth a solid 4 stars based on all other factors combined with not having an eye for this sort of thing.  Video games  truly looked great as did Disney cartoons and they were simply fantastic.  If you have this set, all you have to do is turn on Toy Story 3 with Trumotion and sit in awe of its vibrancy.Aside from great gaming and cartoons this set really falls short in the live action realm.  Because I am in a position to know the differences in color reproduction (AND I'M PICKY) and I can tell you with confidence the weak point of this TV is the color accuracy.  If you are someone who really cares about good quality picture reproduction, this simply isn't the set that is going to give it to you.I hope my review makes sense and helps some of you make the best decision for YOU.  I really think this set is deserving of a 4 or 5 star rating as some of you have given, but for me I can't give it more than 2 stars having a keen eye for color and realism.  On the plus side, I have never had to return anything to Amazon in the past and this time I am going to.  Amazon has been absolutely great to work with and have arranged to have UPS pick the package up for me at my home and expedite a return.  I will likely use them again for a different TV purchase, but not for an exchange of the same set.  Thanks!!", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Incredible picture, great price", "Author": "C.

It does what it's suppose to do very well and that is simply to hold the television.The only thing I will suggest (as other reviews have suggested as well) is that you turn off the power savings setting. The resulting variation of screen brightness is very annoying.

We've had it for about a month now, and we love it. I was a bit OCD in picking out a new TV, as this is my first HDTV, and I literally spent weeks doing the research, running around the stores to see the floor models, and making a final decision on this TV.  Here is some feedback on specific areas:Picture:- The picture quality of this 47\" LCD is amazing when viewing programs in 1080 resolution (our cable box sends a 1080i signal for HD programming, and that is the majority of the programming we watch). It does leave a little something to be said for viewing SD programming (480i) on this large TV, BUT you can adjust a setting on the Picture menu to have the TV automatically adjust the screen's aspect ratio depending on the signal (1080 vs. 480), and that helps. The TV will then automatically \"shrink\" the viewable screen size to make SD programs more viewable (less blurry, fuzzy, etc.).- Energy Saver: The TV comes factory set with the Energy Saver on Auto, and this is not a setting I recommend. Using the enrgy saver at anything higher than medium makes the screen extremely dark, and results in an unpleasant viewing experience. We have it set to Low, and that works fine (you can also turn it off completely).- I like that there are multiple options for the type of programming I'm watching, such as Standard, Sport, Cinema, Game, and Vivid. I've tried switching from Standard to Sport when watching football, as well as turning the TruMotion setting to high, and this makes watching sports amazing (as you can really follow the fast-action clearly and without blur from screen-refresh).- The picture color is absolutely stunning. We were watching Survivor in HD last week and actually felt like we were sitting in paradise on the beach. Every time we turn the TV on and pull something up in HD, I comment to my wife how amazing the color and picture quality are. We have not tried gaming or using a Blu-Ray player yet, so I cannot comment on the quality there, but I don't doubt it will be just as amazing.Audio:One of my initial concerns based on reading the reviews on all HDTVs was the poor audio quality from small speakers. BUT, I have to say that the audio quality on this TV is actually really good. I thought that I was going to need a separate soundbar or sound system, but I am putting that on hold because the speakers built into this TV do a really good job, and I have NO complaints about the audio.Installation:The TV came well packaged and was easy to get out of the box and laid out on the floor. The directions for attaching the stand to the bottom/back of the TV could be a little clearer, but we got the job done. My only complaint is that if you're trying to attach the stand while the TV is lying flat on the floor, it's not gonna happen. This was a 2-person job, because one person had to hold the TV up at an angle so the other person could screw on the stand (as the stand extends out to the front of the TV and thus is not attachable when the TV is flat on the ground). I might recommend laying it on the edge of a bed so you can attach the stand easier without lifting it awkwardly. After that, it was quite easy to lift and position on the entertainment center.Setup was a bit confusing, as I did not initially realize that when hooking it up to a cable box via HDMI, you need to change the Input setting (via the remote) to HDMI. I stupidly sat there for 20 minutes trying to get the TV to program itself and the channels in the default TV mode. But when I finally switched to the HDMI Input mode, the signal from the cable box was immediate. Don't be stupid like me!Bottom line: We love this TV and I would definitely recommend it. Granted, it doesn't have all the bells and whistles that other, more expensive TV's have (3-D, Internet, etc.), BUT it more than makes up for it with picture quality (and truth is that the picture quality on some of those fancier TV's is pretty awful).

I did a lot personal research and read quite a few customer reviews (on Amazon and elsewhere) all of which indicated that this 42 inch LCD TV was a really good one. They were wrong... it is an excellent TV. I am NOT disappointed in my selection. Short and sweet the picture is great even stunning when viewing true 1080p broadcasts and/or blu-ray media. This is not a 3D TV but the TV is so clear and sharp that (for example) some scenes in AVATAR seemed to jump right off the screen. Sports, prime time programming, even the nightly news are all brilliant... again when broadcast in true 1080 HD quality. This TV comes with internal picture calibration which allows the viewer/user to fine tune dare I say super tune the image to exact personal preferences. Standard/preset adjustments are available too but I found using the calibration settings by far achieved the best result. The 120Hz refresh rate means no blurred motion when watching sports/action programs. The sound isn't bad either... i.e. using the TV itself no external speaker i.e. home theater system. If you want to hook up to external/home theater audio you can via optical connection. This unit also has a very good internal tuner for those who want to receive over the air HD broadcasting using an outside antenna. Again the picture quality is excellent for prime time HD broadcasts and the tuner pulls in a surprising number of channels. I got 32 in the Cincinnati area. This TV is not the newer LED/LCD version so it's not as thin and theoretically not as bright nor sharp. In the store nor at home I can't tell the difference at least concerning picture quality. It does not have 'smart' internet capability and again no 3D. I mounted my set on the stand and not on the wall. This TV is big and heavy enough to produce an unavoidable but small wobble when stand mounted. An anchor screw is provided to fasten and so secure the stand and TV to any surface it is on though this is not a realistic option for a finished/fine furniture surface. As such it should be located in a corner or up against a wall and not in an open area where it might get an errant bump. If you have kids get it deep in the corner or better yet... up on a wall. At around $600 this, in my mind, is a terrific value for what I want out of flat screen HD TV... which is... to watch it. Hope this helps.

Only negatives the stand is kind if cheaply made, it does it's job if you you don't plan on moving it around a lot, though you can tilt it slightly without too much worry.  Also of notice if you view this TV from many different angles or standing up the picture quality isn't as nice as the Plasma, but as long as you have a direct view sitting down I think it surpasses the some if the best Plasmas, great for bedrooms not so great for living room if you have many people watching from many different angles.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome tv!", "Author": "Nancy", "ReviewID": "R3ALDQ000WN3JU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just received the LG 42LK520 TV from Amazon.

The set had the supposedly preferred S-IPS panel but there was a graininess to the picture when the camera panned over light backgrounds that was especially noticeable during sporting events. There was also a small light smudge in the main viewing area that gave the the impression it was moving along with the camera.There is some discussion that the problem could be caused by a anti-glare coating. While the coating reduces glare, it can sometimes cause grainy and smudge-like effects in the way it affects light produced by the backlight, especially with light colors. It's like a coating was applied with a cheap brush. I don't know if this is the case with this model, but it accurately describes the issues I saw. The odd thing is the problem is not visible when the camera is still or with a dark background and unless you watch sports, you might not notice it at all.I contacted LG and they are aware of the issue. However, their fix was to turn off the Tru-Motion 120hz feature and the Energy saver in all viewing modes. First, I had already tried that and it didn't work. Second, turning off Tru-Motion means you no longer have a 120hz set, which was not a viable alternative. So I decided to return the TV.The HD picture was very good to excellent and I would have kept the TV if that also applied to sports programming. The SD picture was very poor. If you care about design, the bezel around the panel is noticeably wider than other TVs (2.25\") and very glossy to the point where it was sometimes distracting while viewing in a bright room and it also gives it a dated look. There is a headphone jack but it cuts out all other sound output so you have to manually unplug it when not in use. The sound for normal programming was very good as was the menu system and versatility it offers.It would be easy to give this a good rating if not for the dirty screen effect. However, since this issue is not uncommon and LG is aware of it, I did not consider replacing with the same model.

My Uncle has a Sharp Aquos 60 inch LED TV and it sounds like the speakers are cardboard box speakers, its terrible. At least my LG TV speakers are actually pretty decent when bass and treble controls are turned all the way up. I select different sound and video modes when I use the TV for different things, movies, games, music, DTV, ect... We do not and probably will not ever get cable of any kind. DTV is good enough for us. Plus, we have netflix for ps3 and the wii as well, which helps a lot. I'm glad I did not get an internet connectable TV, because internet connectable TVs most of the time have bad reviews. I mostly go by the reviews, and this TV has great reviews. So I went for it and I love it! I hate the fact that it has to be cleaned and dusted even though I love doing that, but I'm afraid it's always going to scratch it every time. Menu is a little slow at switching from one windows to the next, but not too bad. Great boot-up time, like 5 seconds! Don't you hate that when you can never seem to get your TV stand perfectly straight on your entertainment center/TV credenza? We have a 10' x 12' foot living room, so its kind of a small room, yes. We were looking into the same TV model, just a 47 inch instead, but the price range was over $250 more. I was originally thinking of a Dynex or Insignia, but I heard they have terrible sound and terrible contrast ratio (like 1000:1) that's terrible. Then I was thinking about a Samsung or RCA. Then I saw this, and I feel in love with it for months. I love this TV!

The Vizio took a long time to start up, had an array of audio problems and was a bit more confusing when switching inputs.  While the LG and Vizio had similarly good pictures, my LG is far better on many other fronts.  The TV starts up very quickly, the input interface is really nice, all the inputs are grayed out and then when you plug a cord in it becomes colored so when you hit input you can see exactly which inputs are plugged into a source: the cable box, DVD, player, X-Box etc.  I like the volume settings, it turns up / down noticeable but not too much or too little with each number and is really a pleasure to use and watch.  I highly recommend this TV, which I got for around 575.00, for folks who want to make a big upgrade from their old 75 lb behemoth tube TV's (mine was a bear to lug to the basement).  It is a wonderful TV for a great price and as I don't do anything too fancy with my viewing / audio outputs, it was a perfect giant step up from my old Toshiba, which refuses to die by the way after many years of use.

Although I prefer shopping on Amazon, the sell was too good to pass up ($950, which, according to by sources in best buy is store cost). If you are considering this tv, there are three things you should consider.1. This tv is very highly rated on consumer reports, and if you are interested in this tv, I think it would be very helpful to pay a month subscription to read it. It is about #3 on their list of 50-55 inch tvs, above Samsung and Sony.2. I searched all over the web for recommended calibration settings, but to no avail. I finally got my hands on the disney hd calibration blu-ray, and must say it is much much much more effective than the built in calibration software. This disc is worth every cent! The settings that it calibrated mine are:Brightness: 57Contrast: 98 (This sounds a little high, but the tv never looked better, and the test images are spot on)Color: 55Tint: 0Backlight: 50Horizontal and vertical sharpness: 503. Although this tv is not an LED, it goes come with LG's flagship level of display settings, in short, this tv can be calibrated to look it's very best. A lot of the LED tv's in this price range do not offer the full calibration settings. (including LG tvs)I would note, that I am using my ps3 as my blu-ray player, and the display setting are pretty extensive on the system, I would imagine that these settings my tv calibrated to most likely would be pretty far off if used by any other blu-ray player.Overall I am very pleased with my purchase. For the price, I think it is as good as you can expect. This tv performs just as well as a Sony or a Samsung (subject to opinion of course).

I've had mine for 6 months and no problems. It's great especially for those that want to upgrade from the old tube tv to this LG 42LK520. It does have a lot of nice features but is also very simple and will last a long time.I found out that the new LED models are just LCD HDTVs with an LED back light that might burn out faster than a regular LCD HDTV so that's one of the reasons why I chose this model.The 1080pixel with the 120hz motion is the best way to go because you will get a very clear picture without any tracers that you might get with a 720p/60hz or 1080p/60hz so I highly recommend this LG HDTV with the 1080p/120hz. LG is one of the best HDTV makers on the market. (Don't buy a Vizio, Phillips or Magnavox,(Phillips owns Magnavox now) they're all crap)!I actually bought the LG 42LK520 from walmart.com and picked it up at the store the same day for $598.00 on sale.From all the reviews I read it seems that people got confused with how the energy saver mode works, it's very easy to either turn it down to the lowest setting so it doesn't get too dark or you can turn it off completely for standard brightness, there's a green energy mode button on the remote that allows you to quickly adjust it.All in all this model is best for people that don't want to mess with a smart wifi internet connected HDTV but you can use this the 42LK520 as a PC monitor and connect a usb device so that's cool.

I shopped around and looked at many TV's in the 42-46\" range, finally deciding that 42\" would be the best fit in my smaller sized room. I promptly added the cable box and BAM! I was watching the NCAA tourney in HD.

I had the stadard HDMI cable that came with the cable box, and the quality lacked. I purchased the Mediabridge cable, and the TV came alive. I now love the picture which is amazing for a TV less that $600. The custom color screener lets you set it up exactly how you want it.My room is basically a sunroom, with 5 36x60 windows, and a large double glass door, so there is a lot of light. I put the TV in the corner at a 45 degree angle, and turned OFF the intelligent sensor, and have ZERO issues seeing the screen. The sound is a little weak, but that wasn't my concern. A nice 8-10\" powered subwoofer will probably bring this TV alive.Overall, picture quality is simply amazing, colors are brilliant, HD movies are incredible. It has two HDMI inputs, I use one for cable and the other for Xbox. The USB port works nicely, and I have not used the component ports yet, as they are becoming obsolete.I give this TV a 9/10; one point docked for sound, but again, that wasn't my primary concern in a small room.

This shouldn't be a surprise, especially for a cheap mid-range HDTV, but I could see it bothering people. Specifically, I had to adjust several presets (particularly back lighting) for games, movies, and TV. But once you get the image right I have no complaints. Coming from an older TV, the 120Hz makes a huge difference in fast paced games and Blurays. (I did try the light sensor for automatic adjustment, but my living room has some rather unique and changing natural lighting and it had some issues with that - when I tested it in another room it was fine, so I'm not faulting the score too much for that)(+/-) The audio isn't that great. It makes my old Toshiba sound like a live orchestra in comparison. It's hollow and frankly weak sounding with certain media, merely OK at other times.

When I moved, I decided to upgrade my TV.  I originally bought a 51\" Samsung Plasma.  I loved the picture, but I couldn't stand the reflection from the glass screen.  As I looked for another TV, I found out that most HDTV's, have a glass screen.  This really narrowed my search.  I eventually settled on this 55\" LG LCD.  I got the free shipping from amazon.  The TV was at my house within a few business days.  The shipping service brought my TV upstairs and made sure it worked.  Luckily I had no bad pixels.  Since this has a matte screen, there was minimal reflection.  However, I wasn't completely satisfied the first 2 days.  I thought the picture quality was just OK.  Plus, there was light bleeding in the bottom right hand corner.  After adjusting the settings, and researching the AVS website, the picture is much better.  Also, the bleeding seems to have stopped.  I use HDMI for TV/Blu-Ray and component cables for my xbox360.  Watching blu-ray is very nice.  Xbox is good.  I'm sure the picture would be better with a HDMI connection.  The TV quality varies widely depending on the TV station.  Certain HD channels almost have blu-ray quality.  While other HD channels, barely look like HD.  I don't use the TV sound, since I have a HTIB.After getting a decent picture, I still wanted more.  So, I bought the Disney WOW disc.  I found the disc easy to use, with good navigation.  It goes through all the basic TV settings: brightness, contrast, color, tint, sharpness and scaling.  It also goes through audio settings, which I didn't use.  Since I already made some adjustments on my own, it wasn't that helpful.  I found it good for 2 reasons:  1) The disc comes with a blue filter, to help you adjust the color/tint.  2) It also helped me with scaling.  I had it set on 16:9.  After a few tests, I changed it to \"Just Scan\".  This provided more picture on the screen, and slightly more detail.  Unfortunately, this was not enough for me to keep the disc.

I was in the market for a new HDTV, slightly bigger than my current 32\", and while I was hesitant to go with a brand I didn't have any personal experience with, I went with this TV and I am so glad I took that leap of faith... LG came through.I've been a fan of Samsung screens for a while now.  My very first LCD computer monitor was a Samsung 17\", then I helped my dad purchase a 55\" LCD HDTV when they were kind of a new thing, and about a year and a half ago I purchased my aforementioned 32\" 720p 60hz HDTV.  When looking to upgrade after moving, needing a bit more screen size after my average viewing distance increased from about 5-6 feet to 10-12 feet, I looked at Samsung first, but this LG caught my eye for its price, favorable reviews, and the bonus 2\" screen size over the Samsung 40\".  When Amazon brought the price down to $549, that was enough for me and I jumped on this set.  After using it for about a month, I would definitely have paid $600 for this TV and probably more; needless to say, I'm thrilled with it.That's enough back story, now into the product itself.PICTURE - Obviously the issue everyone cares most about is picture quality.  Well let me say this LG performs fantastically.  I watch DVDs and Blu Rays on it, I stream NetFlix on it, I game on it (Xbox 360 with component cables and PS3 with HDMI) and for all of them the TV is amazing.  As I've said, I mostly watch from a bit of a distance (about 10 feet) but sometimes I sit up closer, maybe 5 feet away, and the picture quality is still stunning and extremely, extremely smooth.It's hard for me to really notice the 1080p over the 720p because my comparison is so contrasted (32\" vs 42\"), but suffice to say my devices have never looked better while being hooked up to this guy.  I think I can notice the 120hz refresh rate.  My 60hz Samsung would \"ghost\" a bit when playing games, something one would get used to, so it wasn't much of an issue, but this TV does not ghost at all.  Picture is crisp and clear and the refresh rate is awesome.  The 42\" upgrade over a 32\" doesn't sound like much but believe me it is extremely noticeable and impressive. This is a big TV.SOUND - Satisfactory sound, nothing unexpected here (which is a good thing).  It has a headphones port on the side which is the feature that I really appreciate (but I think is commonplace with HDTVs these days). I haven't had to blast the sound up to max ever yet, even when I want things to be LOUD, and haven't experienced the speakers crackling out during any loud moments even when I've had it at it's highest, which was maybe 65% of the maximum allowed.  All in all for sound, completely satisfactory.MENU - I don't place much value on menus on a TV... every set has its own menus (it seems) and once one figures them out, they're as quick and efficient as they would be on another setup.  The only thing that could be a detriment to a set regarding menus is if the menus are convoluted and counter-intuitive, this set's menus are just fine.OTHER - This TV touts its \"energy-saver\" feature.  Essentially, what this does (I haven't used it much) is dim the screen after a certain amount of hours of use per day.  I believe it may also have an iPhone/iPad style sensor where it detects the amount of light in a room and adjusts the screen brightness accordingly... I guess it's a nice option to have, but maybe on my 3rd day of using the TV I turned the EnergySaver to \"minimal\" and have left it there.  Can't complain about having options though right?Also, one thing I like better about this system instead of my last Samsung are the actual buttons for power/input/channel/volume on the side of the set.  The Samsung I had used touch sensors, which were kind of cool but when it's dark, good luck getting the right \"button\" clicked.  This way, with real buttons, one can memorize the order of the buttons and can operate the TV (if needed, a remote is included obviously) in the dark from the set itself.  Something that comes up rarely but when it's an issue it can be annoying; no issues here.OVERALL - If you couldn't tell, overall I'm extremely pleased with this purchase. I love the extra 2\" from the 40\" Samsung, the price is great, and I couldn't ask for better picture quality.  I will definitely purchase from LG again in the future.Thanks for reading, hope I was helpful.**EDIT on 6/27/2012 below:**After owning and using the TV for about 8 months with I'd say \"moderate\" usage, the power supply died.  The TV would have instances when running on HD (which uses more power, presumably) where the screen would flicker on for a split second, and the TV would power off and power back on.  Over the course of a week this recurring issue persisted, with more and more resets before the TV would function as normal again, until it finally stopped turning on altogether.$180 in repairs later, it now works like a charm.  A little internet research during the downtime had me suspecting it was a power supply issue, which the repair guy ultimately confirmed.  $10 in parts $170 in labor for the repairs.  Presumably he just grabbed a new power supply and soldered it on, at least I hope he did... if he just plugged it in I'll feel ripped off (I didn't open the back to check, I will if it dies again).Based on my internet research this problem is somewhat common with this model of TV.  Except for this one issue I am extremely pleased with the TV, although having to drop another $180 on it wasn't too fun. If that is a one-time issue that the power supply fixes, I'll still be pleased with my purchase (although at a total price of around $700 it's not exactly 5 stars).If you experience a similar issue with your TV, know that it's likely a faulty power supply.  If you have an electrician friend I'd recommend investigating self-repair.  Again, I did not verify, but if this TV's power supply works like a PC power supply, it should be fairly simple to replace yourself, just a matter of buying the correct wattage or whatever which is more than likely listed on the old part.Best of luck.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great for the price.", "Author": "Vutar", "ReviewID": "RH3DQ4DB1Q8JF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pro:Picture: You may have to mess with the setting to get it where you want but it is a great picture for the price.

I have the TruMotion on low right now (there are several settings, including \"User\" defined) and it was so crisp and clear. I saw a little of the \"soap opera\" effect that other reviews have talked about, but honestly I wouldn't know what that was if I hadn't seen in so much in other reviews, but it didn't bother me at all. I haven't done to much customization yet with the screen. I really like the Clear Voice technology. You can adjust the voices levels so they don't get lost in the background. It was nice not having to crank up the volume so I could hear the people talk and not have to get blown away when the volume on the action increased. I think the speakers for the tv are good, but I still plan on upgrading to at least a sound bar with a sub for greater depth of sound. So far so good.

TV 1: Fairly intense \"Flashlighting\" that spanned about 2 thirds of the screen. From the bottom middle of the screen it was like two flash lights shinning to the top left and right corners. I ordered from Amazon and they make it easy so I decided to give this TV another chance. I got the 2nd TV up and no flashlighting! The picture looked great, I thought all was going to be well... Then later the same day the TV started powering off and on by itself over and over which could only be stopped by unplugging the TV. After plugging it back in it would either become completely unresponsive, turn on and then start turning off and on again, or work normally. From that point the off and on cycle was pretty much constant with short periods of staying on. So the TV will go back, and I'll be going with a completely different TV. Maybe it could be fixed, but I don't want to buy a new product that has to immediately be repaired.This is disappointing, because the picture truly was great. Certainly worth the price, if it worked. The picture was so nice it doesn't feel right saying avoid this TV, but I can't recommend or like it considering getting 2 bad TVs in a row. This model has great reviews everywhere, so maybe you'll be among the lucky.More about the TV...It is very light. The picture is excellent. The options are easy to use. The sound is good enough for a TV.The stand feels too wobbly. Two of the holes for the stand on the first TV were about 1/8\" off and required a slight improvement. The screen is more glossy than expected for a LCD which leads to some minor mirroring in some conditions. Most annoying, some light sources can cause a rainbow to appear on the screen I believe due to the glossy screen.My final thoughts... The TV when working with no issues probably would have got 5 stars from me, maybe 4 due to the glossy screen.

Had purchased a Sony KDL BX421 at Costco.  Tv was good for viewing shows (have dish hd), however Wii games were blurry.  Xbox 360 looked fine though.  Took Sony back and got the LG 42 LK520 instead as it is 120 hz vs Sony which is a 60 hz tv.  Again HD broadcast shows looked clear but Wii games were blurry (slightly improved over Sony though).  PS 2 games were really blurry (don't know if this has to do with the fact that the wii is being routed through an Onkyo AV receiver).  Plan on connecting the Wii directly to the tv to see if this makes any difference.  Would have tried making adjustments on the tv except there are no fine tuning options for the LK520.  Overall tv has advantages over the Sony in terms of inputs ( currently have 3 game systems, satellite, and av receivers connected to tv with 2 hdmi, 1 component, 2 composite inputs) and viewing angle (wider with LG).  Also be aware that if you are a California resident and purchase an item from an Amazon vendor based in California, you will be charged sales tax.  I discovered this after the fact (I've purchased items from Amazon over the years due to their great prices, free shipping, and no taxes.  This is the first time I've paid taxes on a purchase.

When watching DVDs, I utilize my 5.1 surround system, but for watching regular television, I haven't had any qualms with the built-in speakers. The remote is well laid out.

Same price and specs across the board. After some research, I went for it. The price was too appetizing. I will spare you the novel about what happened, but here it is in a nutshell. TV shows up in mail. Box looked good, not trashed out. Plug TV in, began to program channels, wouldn't load channels. Tried it again, then TV powered off and could not turn back on. Called Amazon, did over the phone troubleshoot, no go. They gave me the number to LG Service. Again, did the over the phone troubleshoot, no go. They sent out a tech a couple days later. Ordered I believe a \"power board or box\"??? Due to overwhelming Christmas deliveries; instead of a day to arrive, took a week, UGH! (not LGs fault) Yet on New Years Eve the component arrived. Stevie the LG tech called and arrived on New Years Eve around 830pm. (finished at 930pm) Fired up my TV and \"walah\" working great! I was able to watch Avatar on New Years Day, looked great! Then watched my Spartans win the Rosebowl on it. Incredible! Again, I knew I was taking a risk when I bought a refurbished unit, Yet in the end it didn't cost me any more $ just some time. As long as I don't have any more issues, I will say that yeah its worth the risk to save a few hundred bucks. I just wish those dopes that refurbished it would go the extra mile and actually plug the unit in and make sure its ALL good. I don't know what refurbished really means? Just fix precisely what was wrong and re-box it and ship it? Or rebuild the whole whole unit? (that obviously didn't happen) In either case currently I am happy.

It has streaming services built in which is nice but you either need to connect it via ethernet or have a supported wifi usb dongle.  I also loaded up some movies onto a flash drive and was able to play them directly on the tv through its usb port.  I put a movie of an HD fire and left it plugged in (you couldn't see the usb dongle) and it was nice to just play that with some music.  The picture looked really good.  The black levels were not amazing but I didn't expect they would be.  I did run into issues with the TV not responding but after a few software updates that issue went away entirely.  We wall mounted the TV and it was very easy.  The TV is dense so while it isn't heavy it can be a little more than you might think in terms of weight.  There is a noticeable glare if you have a lot of windows but we would just shut the appropriate blinds and that fixed it.  I cannot comment on the sound because I used a surround sound system from the start.  I find most TV speakers really aren't that great despite how they are advertised.The TV itself looks nice.  The bezel is a bit thick and displays fingerprints like crazy but the included microfiber cloth can remedy those quickly.  It has a light on the front that displays LG but all of those lights can be turned off in the settings so that it is all just black.  There are no physical buttons on the TV they are all tough sensitive on the front bottom right corner.  This is slightly annoying because you cannot really see them or even feel them.  Once it notices your finger there it lights them up though.  The TV also has a nice feature that it can turn on and off at a certain time you set and to a certain TV channel and volume setting.  I do this so that it turns on in the morning and I watch the news while I get ready.One thing that was pretty annoying (and is an issue with most thin TVs) is trying to make connections to the back of the TV without looking.  There is very little space between the tv and the wall and even with feeling around first the connections are hard to get right and can be frustrating.All in all it is a good TV.

I have no experience with LG, but from the reviews of this TV and others seems they make a good product that the majority of people like.  The only catch I found on this model was that it had a bad internal antenna!  Hey, if you are going to spend around a grand for a TV spring for cable or satellite!!I'm not quite sold on 3D. I think it's still a little early to drop another grand on one of them.  I bought a blue ray that has internet connection so didn't care that this is not a `smart' TV.  So it met my needs.Amazon delivered the TV quickly and best of all....free!  Most places I checked it was $60 plus to just deliver it.I had the TV installed and hung on the wall using Amazon's Service Valet.  That by the way was a quick and easy phone call to setup.  I will review them separately.  To me that is the only way to really appreciate these big screens.  Not to say the stand looked cheap, I thought it looked OK just don't want to chance it getting hit and then falling over.  Secure on the wall is the only way to go.  The guys who installed it had only nice things to say about LG which made me feel more secure with my purchase.With book in had I sat and played around with the settings.  I thought the zoom controls were fun if you want to turn the picture bigger or fill the screen.  It did this with surprisingly little picture loss, but I normally have it just sense the picture size.  So most standard TV shows just fill up the middle, but I'm fine with that.I have satellite, and a coaxial cable so the picture is not perfect, but with some tweaking on the very interactive controls this TV has I was able to get an OK picture.  On HD channels it is very clear and lives up to its HD name.  By the way, the controls are good.  I do advise to watch the DVD that comes with the TV.  It explains the settings much better than the book.  The first thing I did was turn the power settings off.  The TV gets WAAAY too dark with them on, no matter the light in the room.I have a big picture window opposite it, and the glare is minimal.  This TV has a nice matt screen, but the frame is glossy.  I think the thing is beautiful!  The cute little LG logo only adds to its charm.It has the volume, on and off on one side, and an RCA cable, HDMI and head phones hookup and USB port to hook your PC on the other side.  I have yet to use this, but looks easy and am looking forward to using my PC or a USB drive on it.  Since it is in on the wall it is very hard to get to the back of the TV so I am grateful for the hookups on the side.  The guys who installed it hooked up the HDMI cable to the back for my DVD player, but I will need help taking the TV off the mount to do anything in the back.  For now that's fine since all I have hooked to it is the DVD blue ray.To get my legacy stereo to work on it, I have to use the head phone jack using a Y cord (which you get on Amazon for less than a buck!)  It works like a charm, but you don't need it unless you are a snob about it (admittedly I am!!) The TV had nice sound with lots of controls to it.I only took 1 star off because of the things it lacks, like internet that others may want, but if you have blue ray or game box that has it, there really isn't a need for it.  Also unless you watch the DVD it can be a challenge to setup, but these are small things that you have with any TV.I do recommend this TV if you can find it.  It's under a grand now.  If you have ever had any questions about getting a TV on a website, Amazon is the way to go.  No hassles and good service and I figure I saved well over $100 in delivery and tax!  Just go to the stores and fine one you want then order through Amazon.

After seriously considering the Sony Bravia line, I finally noticed this model at our local Walmart. It was every bit as clear and vibrant as the Sony, but much more inexpensive. The 47-inch size is perfect for the small (12 to 16 foot) viewing distance. The sound without the home theater is passable, but nothing spectacular. It is an attractive unit, and assembles easily.After noticing that there was a sizable price difference between the Walmart.com online price, and the Walmart instore price (the in store was much more expensive), I checked Amazon. I've never ordered anything this expensive online before, but I have had positive experiences with Amazon returns in the past, and for the $100 + price difference, I was willing to take a chance. The tv was delivered even faster than expected, and the company that delivered it was extremely courteous.The only disappointment was with the LG remotes. I have a LG BluRay home theater with Simplink, and have found that both remotes are incredibly slow. Once you push a button, you have to wait a second or two or three to get a response.

ONe of the first features I really like is the 120 hz motion setting, no more blurring of action sports.  Another big thing with the LG was there was no need for a sound bar as there was with the Vizio.  I don't know if Vizio has addressed that with their newer models or not but the sound of the LG was plenty loud and clear, not tinny at all.  Another factor was price here at Amazon.  Unbeatable compared to other outlets such as Walmart, Best Buy, etc.  Have had the set for 4 months now and overall evaluation is 5 stars.

It's a very nice looking product and plays good.  Unfortunately, within a few days, the screen went dark, but I could still hear the sound, while watching regularly tv programming.  Two days later, it happened again, while watching a DVD.  I had to call it in for servicing.  I am currently waiting for a replacement part.  I would recommend the tv, but only if you buy it new.  I considered purchasing a Vizio, which I could have gotten for a couple hundred dollars less, but decided to keep this and purchase the 4 year (they claim 5, but it's only 4 since it begins the day of purchase, which a one yr warranty already exists for) extended servicing contract with.  So, overall with the money I saved on a refurbished item and purchasing the contract, it works out ok for now.

It doesn't.  You can navigate into the video_ts folder and start it playing the VOB files, but the picture isn't scaled, so you have a 720 pixel wide image centered on the screen.

Play the same DVD from a laptop, attaching the TV as an external monitor or play the physical DVD in a DVD player and you get a full-size image.This could and should be fixed with a firmware upgrade.

From the unboxing, the installation was simple enough and light enough to carry myself to mount it. The TV doesn't have a turn on/off sound so that was a bit weird, but the colors are amazing and so are the 120 Hz fast motions. I played COD on this TV and graphic just comes out way too good to be true. What is best about this product is the way you can customize the color and the picture setting more specifically in your likings without much limits like settings from the other manufacturer. I've got used to the Samsung or Sony menu settings a lot, so dealing with the LG's own set of menus took a bit of time, but after couple of lessons from the manuals and tryouts, it became easy to handle.

I initially wanted to get the 42\" LED TV but wasnt gettin the impression that it was a good tv by the reviews and had alot of 5 stars and a number of lowstars.appearence/size:This tv is big! The stand in not that well build so i would recomment getting one of those \"tip wires\" that screw to the back and to the wall to avoid any falls; just to be on the safe side.  The shiny black plastic id okay too doesnt distract the viewing expereince in any way. The tv just can be moved left and right and not up and down.  The tv has three HDMI ports on the back.This tv is awsome and worth the money! It is clear and has a sharp image and I have it connected to my xbox 360 and first played call of duty modern warfare 3 and i was so loving the experience of the tv.  The speakers areent all that loud but then again neither are most LED or LCD tv's. I also bought the HDMI cables (Mediabridge Ultra Series - High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet - (10 Feet) - Category 2 Certified - Supports 3D & Audio Return Channel [Latest HDMI Version Available]\" and they worked so good and the picture at 1080p just had me staring at the tv, cables are a must get from media bridge and were a GREAT! price.  I turned off the energy saver cause it seemed to go dim on me at times and love it with the energy saver mode off.dislikes: sound from speakers not that loud and the stand is shakey, and menus are kinda weak lookinALL IN ALL, I am a shop around and doin my reviews type person and for the money and size, this is a great buy and you wont be disappointed!!!p.s.

Even with that point I still trust that the tv will not topple over. Another, you need to point the remote towards the middle of the tv in order for the remote to work. No big deal there though.So far this tv is what i expected it is a good tv at a good price.

I'd had the Phillips for about 6 years and was amazed at how prices had come down.  My eyes were drawn to the LG 55LK520 55-INCH 1080P 120Hz LCD TV.  My Phillips was an LCD TV and I was very impressed with both the durability and picture quality.  I'll be a lifetime LCD TV Buyer.That being said I checked numerous 55 inch TVs and compared price, picture quality, features, sound, and ease of use.  I finally settled on the LG 55LK520.  Everything I needed and nothing I didn't....or so I thought.Amazon delivered it via Pilot Freight with a delivery date of September 6.  Imagine my delight at receiving a phone call saying Pilot Freight had received my TV and would be delivering it on Sept. 1.  WooHoo!  They gave me a 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. window, and were actually at my house by 2:15 p.m.  And here's where I have just a small gripe.  The carton the TV comes in CLEARLY states that it is to be a TEAM TWO MAN LIFT.  Pilot sent one guy.  Myself, I'm disabled, but helped him as best as I could.  Now, the delivery guy was just as nice and helpful as he could be, but sending one man for a two man job is going to get someone hurt.  Pilot, are you paying attention?My brother and nephew arrived about an hour later to help me get the TV set up and going.  Assembly of the TV stand was a walk in the park.  As a matter of fact, everything about the TV was easy to take care of.  Picture quality is amazing.  Sound...eh, not so much.  So as I go to hook the TV up to my Stereo Surround Sound System, I discover no stereo rca outs, only an optical digital out.  This would have been okay, but there was no optical cable included with the TV. So, I had to buy an optical cable and the proper digital to analogue coverter so I could hook the television to my stereo.  However, everything else worked like a charm.  I love this TV.  The instruction manual was clear and concise.  Read it and you'll not have a bit of trouble setting this TV up.  My only gripe...no analogue stereo outs to hook it to my older stereo receiver.  Come on LG, for the price you and everyone else charge for these TVs, what's adding two RCA outs for analogue stereo?**Update**  After watching regular DVDs and some Blu-ray Discs, I am even happier with this TV.  The DVDs look great and the Blu-ray is just AWESOME.  I never expected the picture to be as crisp and clear as it is, especially with this being a 55\" TV.  I have to say, I was a little worried after reading some of the negative reviews.  But, I guess that there will always be a few of any product that slip past quality control.  This one, I'm glad to say, didn't.  It's performing just as it should and continues to \"WOW\" me each day.  Best TV I've bought in a long time.  Still wish it had RCA analogue outs so I could hook it up to my older Surround Sound System.  But I'll have my adapter in soon and I'll let you know if it was worth the extra expenditure.

Like most consumers, I was initially overwhelmed by the number of options for buying a decent flat-screen TV, and I hope that this review helps people in a similar situation. Other reviewers have already elaborated on the picture quality, set-up and features of this TV set, and I am loath to beat a dead horse by spending too much time over these details.I needed a decent 42\" TV for my bedroom, mainly for playing PS3 games and watching high definition movies. Budget constraints precluded getting a Samsung or Sony LCD television (I was trying to make the best of a meager budget of approximately $500). Another requirement was that the TV should have decent quality sound output, as I am averse to investing in an expensive home theater setup at the moment. I also needed a TV with a fast refresh rate, since fast-paced action sequences in film and gaming on the PS3 might introduce motion blur if the TV were hampered by a slow refresh rate. This last criterion eliminated all 60Hz LCD television sets from consideration, which was unfortunate, since there are a lot of decent 60Hz TVs for the price I was willing to pay.Being open to both LCD and plasma technologies, I shortlisted 3 TVs that fit the bill: this one, the LG 42LV4400 42-Inch 1080p 120Hz LED-LCD HDTV and the Samsung PN43D450 43-Inch 720p 600 Hz Plasma HDTV (Black). The Samsung plasma TV looked promising: traditionally, plasmas are known to offer better contrast, better blacks and better viewing angles than LCD TVs, although the difference between plasma and LCD televisions now is not nearly as pronounced as it used to be. The only thing that put me off about the Samsung was the 720p resolution. This was more idiosyncratic than being backed up by the force of reason: indeed, you can read endless articles online about the 720p resolution being adequate for the screen size of 42 inches as well as being ideal for PS3 games. Be that as it may, in this age of 3D TV sets, I had a distinct sense of unease about putting money down on a lower-resolution TV; I did not want my enjoyment of the TV to be encumbered by a nagging apprehension about it's lower resolution.The LG LED TV looked favorable as well, but customer reviews on Amazon brought to light issues with quality control and the sound output, which ultimately deterred me from making the purchase. Ergo, I decided to take the plunge and purchase this TV set, and thus far I can't be happier with it. The first thing that I did was turn off the Energy-Saver feature as many reviewers have recommended. I tested the television with Uncharted 3, a PS3 game known for it's beautiful graphics and it looked quite amazing. I also played a high-definition copy of Inception and the TV recreated every scene in stunning detail. I compared results against a friend's Sony BRAVIA EX 400 Series 46-Inch LCD TV, Black, and I can safely say that this TV far surpasses the Bravia in both picture and sound quality. While it is possible that the Bravia might look just as good with proper calibration, out of the box the LG TV looked much better.EDIT -- I checked out the product code of my TV and after doing some research on AVSForum, I can conclude that the panel type on my TV is an IPS panel. The product code for my TV is UA-AUSYLFR, where the \"Y\" designates an IPS panel. For those of you who do not know, an IPS panel offers better viewing angles and less input lag compared to other types.

I read several expert and consumer reviews and was confident that this would be a great TV. The TV is nice, blu-ray and video games look amazing, but I could not get over the dirty screen effect. When watching something with a light background like hockey, there is a very noticeable graininess whenever the camera moves with the action. It was so distracting that I could not watch hockey. It is even noticeable on the grass of a football field or any show that has a light background, even without a lot of movement. This is NOT motion blur, it really does looks like the lcd screen is dirty or dusty even though it is clean, hence the dirty screen effect. I also was not too impressed by the TruMotion 120hz, even with it on high football got pretty blurry during fast action. Also this is an IPS panel, not a VA panel (there are no 47 inch VA panels anyway) so I know the inferior panel is not to blame. I don't know if all the lk520 tv's have this problem to some degree or if I just got a bad set, but I had to return it because this was a deal breaker for me. Even though I loved the set otherwise, I just could not justify paying 650 dollars for a TV with a flaw like that. Also to note: the audio was pretty good, not great.

Moreover, she really didn't seem to think Amazon should have any assistance to offer since it was a shipping issue. After three times on hold where she simply called FedEx, I got the number myself and called them. Seems that they had a NO SIGNATURE REQUIRED however, the driver did not leave it on my porch. (he clearly had better judgement than the Amazon shipper). FedEx then proceded to tell me they had no information about the actual delivery because it was a third party contractor they sent it out with. They told me it was NOT out for delivery the 28th, but was just turned over to the third party and that it would be delivered on the 29th. They also said the guy was authorized to just leave it but could decide not to if he felt like it. (he had already tried to deliver it by then and did not leave it. FedEx did not know that). Had they been able to track their own product I would have been able to arrive and accept the order and not miss an entire day's work. So I asked for a window of time...they could not give me one. Well, that is not true...the window was 8 AM to 8 PM. I had to take an entire day off work and remain home for the delivery. It came after 4 in the afternoon.  As a prime member this really was not acceptable. What is free shipping worth when you have to burn a day off sitting in your house all day long? Shame on Amazon and FedEx for this! One last thing. I had activated the alert feature for status notifications to be sent to my phone. The driver tried to deliver the television at 12:24 on the 28th. The text informing me of this hit my phone at 12:18 on the 29th....a few minutes short of 24 hours after the fact. I still have not received the alert that the shippment came yesterday. I guess that will come after 4 today.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV for the Price!", "Author": "Paul M.

Freeman", "ReviewID": "R21JO3162CIS5R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV's picture quality is gorgeous -- crisp, realistic, fast refresh -- WOW.  You won't find a a better looking TV picture in this price range.  The screen gets really dim in a darkened room because its \"Intelligent Sensor\" mode is turned on by default.  I assume that was necessary for its Energy Star rating, but you'll almost certainly want to turn it off.  The trick is to the picture menu, run through the Picture Wizard and create an Expert Mode profile.  From then on, you can use the Quick Menu to tweak the picture controls (brightness, contrast, sharpness, etc) to your heart's content.The audio is just OK, nothing great.  I'm sure it's difficult for a manufacturer to fit high quality speakers into such a slim case, but I was a bit disappointed nonetheless.  And I don't see any speaker outputs, either.  I keep the sound turned down most of the time anyway, so the mediocre audio quality is not a big deal for me.  You might disagree if you're a serious audiophile.The controls were a little bit confusing for the first couple of hours (\"How do I control the brightness?  Oh, I have to create an Expert Mode profile first\"), but they didn't take too long to get used to.  At least, most of the information necessary to operate the controls are on the web.  LG included a user's guide for the TV on a CD, but I haven't even bothered looking at it.  Google found answers to my questions.------------------UPDATE 9/13/2011I've had the this TV for a month an a half now, and I'm still blown away by its picture quality.  Every time I watch someone else's TV, I think, \"Wow, mine looks so much nicer!\"  I'm also favorably impressed by how well the TV works in our glarey living room, with windows on 3 sides.  LCDs have historically done poorly in rooms with fluctuating lighting conditions, but this LG TV is great.  The matte screen finish looks nice and helps keep glare a comfortable level.I continue to be underwhelmed by the sound quality.  This TV's speakers sound tinny, especially in the low range.  I personally think people shouldn't have to purchase an entire home stereo system just to get halfway decent sound quality while during the occasional concert on PBS.  But I don't know enough about recently manufactured TVs to know if mediocre sound quality is a problem industry wide, or if it's limited to this particular TV.  I do know that our inexpensive old TV sounded much, much better.", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "GREAT TV", "Author": "BIG DAWG STL", "ReviewID": "R2V59G1KNRY5S7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THIS 42\" LG LCD TV IS ONE OF THE BEST BUYS THAT I'VE MADE.

After a little over a year the TV started to turn itself off.  This was an occasional problem that became worse over the ensuing months.  There was no pattern to the unexpected turn offs.  I searched the internet and found that many people were having the same type of problems with their LG televisions.  I replaced the surge protector and the wall outlet to make sure the problem was not the electrical service.  The problem persisted and eventually it became unwatchable so I finally called LG customer support.  The support woman was friendly and arranged for an LG technician to come diagnose the problem.  She did advise that, \"since I failed to protect my investment with an extended warranty,\" I would be charged $89.00 for the service call.  The warranty was for one year.  I expected to be charged knowing that I was out of warranty so I agreed to the price of the service call.The service technician that came was pleasant but barely spoke English.  He asked me what the problem was and I explained it to him.  He said that I needed a PCB main assembly and told me the part was $410 and the labor another $150.  Said I could buy a new 55 inch LG television for $1,000 and shouldn't fix this one.  He did no diagnostic work and was only at the house for 10 minutes.  Most of that time was spent trying to explain the problem to someone who did not grasp the language.  He collected his $89 and gave me a receipt.  I noticed on the pre-printed receipt it already had the description of my problem that I had given the customer support woman.  He could have called me and not charged for a service call as he obviously didn't want to fix the television.The only good thing that came out of the service call was he put the part number of the PCB main assembly on the receipt.  Amazon sells the part for $176 and another business sold it for $136.  I took my 'disposable TV' apart and in twenty minutes had the PCB main assembly disconnected.  The new part arrives in a few days and hopefully fixes the problem.  If not, I certainly won't be buying a new LG.

The menu and setup was intuitive and quick. I fired the cable company and went with OTA signal with an indoor Mohu antenna and the picture is unbelieveable. I love it! Also hooked up my laptop and able to use it with a bluetooth keyboard as a giant monitor and can watch stuff from  the many streaming sites that i have now joined.The only thing i don't find excellent on the set is the stand. Not that i don't trust it, it just isn't as strong a build as the rest of the tv. Also sound is lacking, but I expect that as most people have surround systems and minimal investment in sound keeps the price low, under $600 in my case.Bottom line, BUY IT!", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Aggravated with LG", "Author": "meeko350", "ReviewID": "R3R5AYZ29IP2FK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "TV has a nice picture and sound.  My box wasn't packaged well.  I ordered a new tv, not open box.  The bottom of the box was missing & only one side was secured.  I had a hard time getting the tv inside because the tv kept trying to fall out of the box.  Part of the stand was missing (the stand body) which made it impossible to attach the base. I've had it propped against the wall for almost two weeks while waiting for LG to send the missing part.  Today I received another stand base from LG instead of the stand body. If LG can't overnight the correct part, I'm returning the tv because if I have to wait another two weeks, my 30 day return period will expire.  This isn't an isolated event, because another Amazon reviewer was also missing part of the stand.Also, an important feature is missing.  Most newer tv's auto switch the input source when an HDMI device is turned on.  I have older tv's that automatically switches the source when I turn my blu ray player on, but the LG doesn't.  I emailed LG about the issue asking if there is a special setting that I need to change, and they stated that LG tv's don't do this.Update:  I emailed LG on 7/26 advising that they sent the wrong part.  The rep didn't even bother to read my email and replied that the part was mailed on 7/22.  I finally did a live chat and got a different rep who said she would try to overnight the correct part.
