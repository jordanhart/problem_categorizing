Television was easy to set up, but the issue I have is the speakers.  They are on the back and the bottom of the television and it makes hearing the television really hard.  The other issue I have is the closed captioning.  It does not work.  I don't know if it is this model or the television itself.  Other than volume and closed captioing not a bad television, its light so it went onto the wall really easy, connected to cable easily.  It has a usb plug on the side so you can download things.", "Date": "July 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very unimpressive. Fuzzy picture", "Author": "Beth McGinn \"bethbga\"", "ReviewID": "R349KKE80DKKCR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I believe this TV was defective to be fair. There was bleed over from the different inputs. Not compatible with TiVo Premiere on HDMI. It shrunk the picture down to a 24\" image and would not zoom. image reshaped, but never got much bigger. I tried this with cable in 3 different rooms and got a fuzzy picture in all of them. The picture on the xbox was very clear with an HDMI cable. I am in the process of returning this item. Paul's TV is the seller and they are understanding and very easy to deal with.  :P", "Date": "September 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Television", "Author": "Glenda J.
