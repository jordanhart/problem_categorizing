{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Works great", "Author": "John L. Reed III", "ReviewID": "R15FGD2G61RFI2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this TV a few days ago and it works great. It picked up some of the basic HD channels on Comcast cable without a converter box (thanks to the QAM tuner).The unit is stylish and thin, with a tilting base. The glossy finish is a nice touch and makes the frame seem smaller than it is. The speakers are on the bottom of the unit making it less wide, and they sound good too.Powered off there is no Stand By light and the ON indicator light is not obtrusive. The remore is average sized and is not excessive with the buttons, only the ones you need and its easy to figure out where they are in the dark.If you can get this TV in the sub $250 range, it is a great deal.I have two cons with this TV, and if they were not present this TV would be 5/5...-At the top and the bottom of the screen the LCD Back light bleeds through the black forming a glowing white area at the edges of the screen-There is no On/Off timer so you can set it to come on in the morning and then turn off, there is only a sleep timer.", "Date": "February 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not worth the hassle....", "Author": "S. Harp", "ReviewID": "RF9M9DSS4KGIZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My fiance and I just bought this TV from Walmart just before Thanksgiving, not even 2 weeks after the purchase the TV started acting up. It would just decide to not turn on. We looked on Philips' website for help, their answer was that the TV needed to be in standby mode (yellow light). When you turn it on there should be a green light. Not only did our TV only display a blue light, it was never yellow or green... we called Philips, they asked us to unplug it then asked for our address so that they can send a different one. The TV they sent was a scuffed up refurb. Two days later, that one does the same darn thing. Called them yet again, they send us another one. Not only did we have a problem with the sets, we're now having issues with the customer service. They expect us to send the sets back and we'd have to drive over 40 miles to get to a FedEx drop point to send it back because they issued the wrong FedEx labels for the free shipping. The woman we talked to at Philips said that she would e-mail us the label and call us in the morning to give us more instructions-She never even called back and it has been over 2 days! We're just glad that we still have the original set and receipt so we can trade it back in at Walmart and upgrade to a TV that works!If the first 3 sets don't work, this model obviously has something major wrong with it. They don't even have good enough repair shops to fix them without damaging the overall appearance of the TV. The customer service is poor and they don't even walk you through the problem, they just try to fix it by sending a refurb without giving you the proper labels to send back the other defective TV.Don't bother with this TV, or Philips for that matter... Its not worth the hassle!!!", "Date": "January 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "When it works it works good", "Author": "David C. Sweet \"David\"", "ReviewID": "R1GB5WM6PRXOUM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I gave this to my wife for Christmas. After about i month it would not turn on. My wife called Phillips and they sent out a new TV. After 1 1/2 weeks the new one does the same thing. If they are unplugged for a while they turn on and remember all of the settings. When it works, it looks and sounds good. Setup was very easy and it detected the 10 digital stations we get from cable. Rather than get another problem tv sent to us I may just plug it in to a power strip and turn it off and on from that. The TV does have a sleep timer. Knowing what I know now, I would not buy this again or recommend it to anyone else.", "Date": "March 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Set will not turn on", "Author": "Browne C.

I called Philips support, who shipped me out a new one without much hassle.  I got the new one along with a pre-paid FedEx label.  Free shipping back was nice, although dropping off to FedEx is a pain if you don't live near a dropoff center.  Anyway, the second TV stopped turning on as well about two weeks later.  Same issue.  On a hunch, I unplugged the power cable for about 30 mins, and the TV worked after plugging it back in.  Not the best solution for a brand new TV, but better than sending TVs back and forth constantly and getting the same crappy model back.Philips customer service seemed very nice (and english-speaking), but this model is a definite lemon.", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "So Sorry to add , issues TV will not turn on", "Author": "Michael Chaves", "ReviewID": "R35O43QVGVR60N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this television as a gift, now i find out after 2 months the TV will not turn on, and repeatedly has issues. very disappointing ..  reaching out to support now, but based on other reviews not expecting much", "Date": "March 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Avoid this TV", "Author": "Soupy", "ReviewID": "R16ANGWRO30JOX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Same problems as other reviewers, TV will not turn on, if you unplug it for 60 seconds or longer then it turns back on.", "Date": "July 8, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "HD 19-inch LCD with 1440 x 900 resolution\nATSC and QAM tuner receives over the air and unscrambled cable\nUp to 5ms response time for clear, fast moving action\nDolby Digital output for connection to a home theatre system\n2 HDMI inputs for full digital HD connection in one cable", "Name": "Philips 19PFL3403D/F7 19-Inch 1440 x 900p LCD HDTV (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51qhHtY33TL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001E43R8S"}}
