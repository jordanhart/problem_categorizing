Not that many features as far as settings go. But honestly when buying TV I was looking for all the settings you can do, however now I have the TV set on sports picture quality and using a sound bar. Sound is not great at all, matter of fact I have not seen any LED 50\" and bigger TVs with great sound. I got a vizio sound bar and I don't need a surround sound at all, its awesome. Never buy a TV without sound bar.Amazing TV with all the Apps provided by VIZIO.", "Date": "September 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Picture...", "Author": "The Hillbilly Machinist", "ReviewID": "REEBEZBC05CJD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this TV as a replacement for a Insignia 50\" plasma that blowed up after 3 years (it really did blow up ... screen shorted and caused a loud explosion which cracked the screen).  Were in the process of having it repaired because it was covered under Best Buy's 4 Year Extended Warranty ... let me clue you folks in on something ... Best Buy's Warranties are a scam at best.  They won't accept any TV back that's over 32 inches for repair at their stores.  Getting the \"Geek Squad\" to come to your residence to repair a TV is like pulling teeth.  Before it's all said and done I'm sure we'll be taking legal action against these con artists and involving the Attorney General!Before that we owned a Panasonic 42\" plasma that lasted 2 years before failing.  Needless to say, those TV's had a known defect and a class action lawsuit was brought against them.Now back to the Vizio M550VSE ... amazing picture quality ... the remote is easy to use and the keyboard on the back is a nice feature but since I use a Logitech Harmony One remote it won't see much use..  I use a Yamaha 7.1 AV receiver and Klipsch speakers for sound so I won't be reviewing the TV's sound quality.  The sole purpose of the TV for my use is picture only.  The built in WiFi is easy to setup and if you don't already have a HTPC hooked up to your TV this would be a nice way to stream movies but since I have a Mac Mini hooked up to the TV this is something that also won't get used.  The TV has 3 HDMI ports ... two in the back one on the side ... Component, PC (RGB not DVI), Ethernet, USB, Optical Audio, PC audio ... so when it comes to connections ... this TV has you covered.  I personally like the Component because it works with my Hauppauge HD PVR which is great for capturing video game or satellite DVR footage.Having only owned plasma TVs which have a refresh rate of 600Hz, I can tell you the 120Hz refresh rate on this TV is more than sufficient and that I haven't noticed any blurring or ghosting while watching sports.  I can't tell any difference between this LCD TV and my other plasma's.Now the all important question ... how long will this great TV last before it suffers from component failure!  Hopefully, the TV last at least 4 years but only time will tell!  All I can say is that the older tube TV were made better than these newer HD TVs.  I have an old Sharp TV that's 20+ years old that still looks as good as the day we bought it!", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "DOA after 70 days", "Author": "Richard C.

Then it would occasionally flash. Then more frequently. After 60 days it was like being at a rave. Rapid flashing, impossible to watch. Then it went solid white.  Returned it.
