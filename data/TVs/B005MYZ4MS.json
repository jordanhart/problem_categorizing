The set up was easy for two adults . Fresh out of the box the picture quality was beyond fantastic. The screen does have some glare that someone might find annoying, especially if you have allot of windows. The first evening we watched some \"NATGEO\". It knocked our socks off. It was if we were on location viewing it live. I have looked at, played with and researched many displays. Would I buy an Elite again? Absolutely . After viewing all the heavenly glory this TV can display, the buyers remorse that sometimes come with a large purchase was nonexistent . In this particular case , I believe you deffinetly get what you pay for . The sound quality is excellent. The 3D is the best I have ever experienced and it comes with a nice bundle of APPS. This TV looks great even when its off?  It is NOT just another Sharp product with an Elite badge. It is a culmination of years of development  between sharp and pioneer technicians. The bar has been raised to a new height with this one....

If you do, you will not be able to watch anything else. Everything else will ruin your eyes and make you long for the Elite. It makes very good LCD sets like the XBR by Sony look like it was designed 10 years ago. The clarity is shocking. The blacks and whites make other set look like you are watching through a vale. Motions are so fluid. 2 d looks like 3d in some scenes. I enjoy watching tv more than I ever have and finding myself watching programs that I am not interested in normally but find myself mesmerized by the beauty of the display. Yes it is pricey....but the best often is. If you can easily spare the cash, and will only be satisfied by the best, you won't be sorry. My qualm is the only pretty good sound quality.  Easily overcome with a home theater sound system.", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Display but Consider Similar Sharp Alternatives", "Author": "NotaSecondTime", "ReviewID": "R3SP8QOI960T6T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The C|net review sums up the performance of this fine display, which is marred only by its high price and highly reflective screen.A more practical approach is the the similar 240Hz AQUOS LC-70LE735U 70\" 3D LED-LCD TV for $3.1K. Same panel and electronics but with standard Sharp firmware.Better for daytime viewing too with no glare screen.The experienced will note that there will be an 80\" 240Hz 3D model coming six months which will sell for about the same price as this overpriced 70\".So the $6-9K is wasted.

Three weeks into it, i still find myself remarking on how incredible the picture is.  Only disappointment is built-in speakers, but no one buys this much TV expecting to rely on those.  I haven't tried 3D yet.To respond to concern that manufacturer will not honor warranty unless product is purchased from authorized seller:  this may be true of Pioneer with respect to Pioneer Elite audio equipment, but I can say from experience this is not true of Sharp with respect to this TV.  I registered without problem and even procured an email from the Elite TV warranty group confirming that my on-site manufacturer's warranty applies regardless where I purchased the TV.  I've also had my first phone service call without difficulty.  They walked me through video adjustments.

Movies come to life a little more and the picture pops like no other I've seen! It really is outstanding.Both 2D and 3D picture quality rival or surpass any TV ever made!That said, you sort of expect perfection from a TV set so expensive, and this set falls a tad short. The biggest issue is that backgrounds can flicker under the wrong settings and circumstances (as if a flickering candle lit one area of the screen) and you can notice slight banding every once in awhile.The good news is that tweaking settings can alleviate the flickering problem to the point where it's no longer distracting, but you should set your expectations that this is the best set around, but is nevertheless imperfect.", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "AIMDOUG", "ReviewID": "R2Z6NCFQMHS3SU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great TV. The picture is awesome. 3D is what really surprised me. I bought it for the picture quality in 2D, but when I got it I had to try the the 3D. I wasn't impressed with the various 3D displays I had seen before, but the Elite 3D made it look good. 3D as a whole has a way to go to. Maybe someday with new technology it will become more natural. But the Elite made it fun to watch.

I wish the tv could somehow select hot inputs the way it does when you plug in a usb device. maybe it can and I just don't know how. Definitely buy a good receiver and surround speakers, the difference is night and day. great tv, still no regrets. The glare issue can be fixed with some good curtains or blinds or shutters. I installed shutters and leave them cracked during the day and the tv is now watchable any time of day. It's still best at night though.I will only talk about picture quality. The TV looks great even when it's turned off. The 70 inch is a large beast. Every guy that enters your house will comment on it. The picture out of the box is good but not great. You have to adjust the settings to get the best picture possible. I used the CNET calibration settings and it looks absolutely stunning. nice and bright and the blacks are the real deal. I use dishnetwork. When i first got the service the picture was not that impressive. Then i used the cnet settings and am now a believer. I havent used bluray with it yet but i'm sure it will look even better with that. Haven't used games with it yet either. The sound quality from the speakers are really great, probably don't even need external speakers but you'll get them anyway. The only negative about the TV is that is is really reflective. I have the TV directly in front of a gigantic uncovered window with plenty of sunlight and it is virtually unwatchable during the daytime (i uploaded a pic to demonstrate). However, once the sun starts to go down it truly has to be seen to be believed. Is it worth 7k? (bought mine on sale brand new for under 6k). This is one of the most expensive items i own, no buyers remorse here. I'm still in awe...btw... someone else commented on national geographic... it really is breathtaking on this tv. extremely clean image, bright, rich colors. and this is on dish (which doesnt carry the best HD signal)...", "Date": "June 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best television you can buy", "Author": "Jerryd", "ReviewID": "RLKBLQSC0068H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Without a doubt, this is the best TV I have ever owned.  The image resolution is so crystal clear that it is almost 3d even in standard mode.  Minor skin imperfections in television participants becomes readily apparent.  The 3d mode is excellent.  Better that what I have seen in 3d motion picture theatres.  Yes, it is very expensive-but in this case, you get what you pay for.  I followed the settings generally found in the Cnet review.

I had some installers tell me the Aquos and the Elite are the same TV's not to spend the money on the Elite.  I stopped by a retailer who had the Aquos and the Elite on their floor, both were using the same DVD player and both were playing the same movie.  I could see a night and day difference between the two TV's!  The Aquos was nowhere close to the Elite as far as brightness and blacks.  Incredible Hulk was a DVD playing at the time.  The green on Hulk looked realistic on the Elite and on the Aquos it was almost a lime green.  You could really tell the color differences between the two.  I know the Elite runs about $3500 more than the Sharp, but hands down the Elite is an awesome picture!  The best picture I saw at this retailer (who carried all the big name brands).Not just picking on the Sharp, I really had all intentions on buying the Sharp.  I walked in my retailer and walked out with the Elite.  I also put the same movie in the new 75\" Samsung 9000 series.  This TV had a great picture too but the room I was installing in has a fair amount of natural sunlight and the screen made for the Samsung is very glossy so I would of had to deal with much more sun glare than I would of had to with the screen on the Elite.The Elite really is hands down the best picture I have seen!  There isn't a TV that I did not research before I made my purchase.  When I saw the Elite on, price went out the window.  Price was a non issue when I saw the picture quality!", "Date": "October 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sharp Elite 70 inch TV", "Author": "AN", "ReviewID": "RBEKDHQEQPKIT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is by far the best TV I have had and seen. Excellent picture, oustanding black levels. Very bright if you want to make it so...will need sun glasses to look if you set it on bright. I have a bright room with many south side windows and have no problem watching TV (my last TV could not be used in room during afternoon secondary to too much light). True to life colors. The 3D (even without true 3D movies) is very good and wearing the glasses is not at all bothersome when it comes to seeing everything in 3D. Watching the Polar Express was wild. The TV converts 2D to 3D, and although not as real 3D, very impressive anyway....looks like you are looking out into a window watching things happen. Although the TV is expensive, there is no buyer's remorse and I have never had second thoughts after it got here (although it took me 6 months of reviews before I bought). Every time you look at picture, you know it is amazing. Also the seller did excellent job delivering. The sound quality from TV speakers is not great and you need any sound system to get the sound needed for the great picture. The set up is easy as well.now a year later, remote sensor not working. Tv no good without remote and sharp has been very slow about responding. After not being able to find tech to come here in the capital of NY, they are approving tv replacement. unbelievable. And it seems to me others have had this problem as well. A big problem as far as I am concerned for such a costly tv.

I had this TV for about 4 days and after reading more of possible image retention with games and there was a lot of glare on the glass screen from my room and the audio was horrible.  I did more research on the Elite and I could not find one person giving this TV anything but 4 - 5 stars. The major complaint was the price of the TV.  I went back to the store and was able to trade up to the Elite 70 inch, which I should have gotten in the first place.  The picture is just so incredible that it blows away and other TV.  The colors and black tones are so incredible there are no words to describe them, you have to see them for you self.  There is no brake in period for the LEDs so you can start playing your games immediately without worrying about image retention and the audio is excellent.  If you want to calibrate it, they suggest at least 12- 14 hours a day on for 3 days for the LED's to brake in.The set comes with 2 pairs of 3D glasses and the 3D is an awesome experience in your own living room. The glasses have an option, if the person does not want to watch the movie in 3D there is a switch you can move on the glasses to 2D and that person can then watch the movie in 2D with the glasses on.The price is sticker shock but you get what you pay for, this is probably the last TV I will purchase for a long -long while, so why not get the best one on the market.You will not be disappointed with this TV in anyway.  10 stars plus", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Over Priced but Love the TV", "Author": "Keith I.

If it happens again, I guess I'll just turn the TV off on the side, not the end of the world lol, but hopefully it won't.
