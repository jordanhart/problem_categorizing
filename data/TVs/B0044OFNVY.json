Also blurs a bit with fast movement. Tried every setting on the picture settings but could not achieve a better picture. When I go to my brother's house and look at his samsung LED tv it's amazing how awesome the picture is when compared to mine. It's like my tv is not even HD when I compare the two TVs. Also not fond of the inputs for the cables on the back of the tv being perpendicular rather than parallel which doesn't allow the tv to lie super flush against the wall.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0044OFNVY"}}
