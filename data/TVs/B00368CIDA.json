{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Perfect fit!", "Author": "Alan", "ReviewID": "R3HQR90ZI4MIJD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My father is in a nursing home facility and we needed a small footprint tv for him to watch and listen to his favorite programs. He is nearly blind so the listening is very important. I was a little concerned about the sound quality that might come from such a small tv, but I was not disappointed after setting up. I only made some slight adjustments to the sound levels (bass, treble) and it was very satisfactory.Ease of use is about as good as one would expect and nice to have a Favorites setting on the remote to set up just the channels that Dad likes. Makes it easier for caregivers to change for him.Dads connection is coax to a cable tv vendor and the tv recognized it was connected and suggested we let it auto set the channels it was seeing. Very nice and never opened the instruction book once.Dad even figured out that the little power light in the center under the screen is also a power button, allowing on/off without the remote!To me the picture quality is very sharp with good color. The stand is tiltable and adequate for the unit, and it really took up very little space on his dresser. We are 100% satisfied with our choice.", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Way better than expected", "Author": "diego", "ReviewID": "R2SE13CDSVLGNU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was thinking it was going to be a crapy and cheap TV but after turning it ON my idea changed completely, the screen quality is off course not that good since it's a monitor with TV Turner but the features like digital turner and the good sound of the speaker is great.Pros: Lots of inputs like HDMIloud speakers sound.SmallCons:Picture quality.", "Date": "October 4, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00368CIDA"}}
