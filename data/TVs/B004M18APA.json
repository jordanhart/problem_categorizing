{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not so much a rating as reporting a lower price.", "Author": "Art Fisher", "ReviewID": "R3220KYHBHVHAE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own two earlier model Sylvania 19\" models, and have had no problems.  I love all the features, especially the 5- band equalizer.  This is Sylvania's latest 19\" model.  Just wanted to report to anyone considering buying this model that it's currently on sale at Kmart for $149.99 through 6/18/2011.  If you're reading this beyond that date continue to check Sunday ads for Kmart and Target as they've both previously sold Sylvania 19\" models for this price in the past, and I'm sure will again in the future.  And if you have, and use, a Target Redcard (credit card) you can save an additional 5% automatically.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "High-Definition LCD TV\nStereo Speakers / 5 Band Equalizer\nSide-Input Panel with HDMI\nENERGY STAR 4.0 Qualified\nAuto Volume Leveling", "Name": "Sylvania LC190SS2 19-Inch 720p LCD HDTV, Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415-ICLI7CL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004M18APA"}}
