{"Reviews": [{"Title": "1st Review of Curtis LCD4299A - Great Bargin in a 3D HDTV", "Author": "Deano", "ReviewID": "R3TSXY57PN2OEO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Can't touch 42 inch 1080p 3D at this price!  Found it on new years for $450.  But with no reviews that were out there on it, it's a risk to buy sight unseen.  But not really once you have.  I thought some of you might be out there looking for someone who had something, anything to say about this specific product.Curtis is a little known mfr, but their other sets get good reviews where it counts for 3D, in the display.  (OBTW, they're NOT the phoenix of Curtis Mathes, an exceptionally high quality mfr that went under in the eighties).You'll want to read DisplayMate's 3D shootout review on Passive 3D superiority to the earlier (and still market dominant) Active 3D.  [...]Bought a refurbished Samsung BDC5500 3D player on the same order (yes, it is a pattern you're seeing here).  Hooked up both & was watching 3D blu-ray in under an hour last nite for only $530 combined.PROs:  Price, bright clear display, price, 1080p 3D, price, 42in, price, 3D glasses same as Theaters (wink wink)CONs: So-So audio, Stand can't pivot, cheap Remote (I know cheap), And no good BDC5500 remote code for Curtis TVs, \"35\" gets ON-OFF control only.  Lastly (from my brief experience) the enormous 16\" x 23.5\" bracket spacing rules out many adjustable wall mounts.  I'll have to fab my own.I've obviously only barely tapped into this TV's feature set, but it did just fine scanning my broadcast TV channels (don't need cable just to watch news), and the HDTV stations I flipped thru come in looking just fine.  And yes, as you probably guessed I use bottom-feeder $15/mo DSL (at least I'm not dial-up) so I can't tell you how it does on internet streaming.Other disclaimers - Never saw a Curtis TV before unboxing mine, so I can't give you a fully informed account of side-by-side viewing competition on a retailer's sales floor.  But I'm a Samsung fanboy when it comes to displays (there, I said it) with 4 of their monitors (up to 27\") gracing various computers in my house.  And nothing with this Curtis HDTV's screen disappoints.Oh, ignore the occasional claim you may run across that 3D Blu-Ray players are either `Active' or `Passive' and must be matched to an HDTV of the same technology.  That's bunk.  This Passive 3D HDTV works just fine with my Samsung player whose MFR is leading the Active 3D camp.  Google it if you still feel hesitant.Now let's be realistic on viewing expectations.  Breathtaking movie theater 3D awesomeness you ain't gonna get (at least if like me you sit close to the front).  At this screen size it's like viewing a 3D scene through a wide window.  But it IS bright & clear 3D, has visual depth, and gives just that much more of an immersive experience over just your basic Blu-Ray.And did I mention price?!?  For the cost of normal 1080p HiDef, you're getting great 3D for free!UPDATE 2/14/12 - Good news.  The Logitech Harmony 300i Universal Remote Control works with this TV.  You can find a refurbished model for $17 bucks online.  Since the programming codes for each individual device are downloaded from Logitech's website, I'd wager any of their universal remote control models will do the trick.  This overcomes the most major of my concerns.  I did find a wall mount large enough to fit the super-wide bracket holes.  It's extra-heavy duty made for TVs up to 65\" and weighing 4 times as much, costing double what should otherwise be necessary for a 42\" TV.  But I'll never have to worry about an earthquake shaking it off it's brackets.Paired with a better remote, I'll up my rating for this TV to 4.5 stars.The built-in audio is still sub-par compared to the other strengths of this TV, but if you're playing the audio through a decent sound system, there's no reason not to have this TV as the centerpiece of a modest home theater system.", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Does everything you could possibly expect for the price", "Author": "Auroran", "ReviewID": "R1NF5WTRE30ZEH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV from Amazon, but with a price match to CompUSA.  It arrived last week, and so far, it works perfectly--as well as I could possibly expect for the under-$500 price I paid.The passive 3D technology (using lightweight polarized glasses) is generally both impressive and unobtrusive.a) The one true 3D Blu-Ray movie I have watched so far is Disney's Christmas Carol.  3D effects were impressive but not eye-popping.  However, I think that was Disney's deliberate intention--to avoid exaggerated 3D effects that might nauseate children and give adults headaches over an hour-and-a-half span.b) 3D (side-by-side) YouTube videos (streamed from the Internet to my Panasonic BDT215P Blu-Ray player) look good.  The TV automatically recognizes side-by-side video and displays it in 3D.c) 3D photos and videos on my HTC Evo 3D phone play reasonably well, in 3D, on the TV via a simple MHL adapter.  The quality is lower because the pixel resolution is that of the phone's own screen (960x540) rather than the source (1920x1080 photo, 1280x720 video).d) 3D photos and videos from my Evo 3D play better when transferred to a USB stick and plugged into the Panasonic Blu-Ray player.  The Panasonic sends side-by-side to the TV, which (again, very conveniently) automatically interprets it as 3D.  The only glitch in this procedure is that 3D videos must be remuxed into the .mkv format by a tool such as mkvmerge (and with the obscure option Disable Header Compression enabled).e) The TV offers 2D-to-3D conversion for anything it displays, from DVDs to broadcast television.  This added-3D effect is generally rather minor, but I will probably use it when I can.In buying this low-priced 3D TV, I consciously made a few tradeoffs:- I didn't need LED backlighting.  The primary advantage of LED backlighting is to make the TV lighter and thinner.  This might have been nice, but I was not willing to pay considerably extra for it.- I didn't need any Internet capability in the TV itself.  My Panasonic BDT215P player has all the Internet capability I need right now; and as the technology progresses, I can eventually replace a small $130 player much more easily than a large $480 TV.- I didn't need a name brand.  I figure that passive 3D technology (for 42\" TVs) is probably manufactured in only a couple places on earth right now, so I suspect that my TV was built in the same place that produces Vizio or LG 3D TVs.  Interestingly, RCA Televisions Canada sells this same LCD4299A as their own, although I could easily believe that Curtis simply bought the RCA name in Canada.  (I don't think there is a \"real\" RCA anymore, just a virtual brand.)", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "great tv!", "Author": "3d addict", "ReviewID": "R7LV5NENT0167", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this tv to basically just see if it was even any good for the price..I have to say this tv wrks great ! The 3d movies look great the regular 2 d looks great and blue rays 3d or not also look great! I feel like i got such a bargain on this tv and is the best buy i have done in a long time!! Buy this set !! You will get the quality of a top shelf brand name for much cheaper!!! A must buy for anyone who wants 3d at a bargain price!", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great, for the price and overall!", "Author": "Steven", "ReviewID": "R2D0PT7W4W9OE4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought an LG Cinema 3D monitor in November. I loved the way the technology worked, but the monitor is only 23\", and I wanted something bigger. 42\" is large enough to enjoy 3D.A quick opinion on passive technology. If you plan on entertaining it is the most affordable option, especially with a tv this cheap. I tested a Panasonic plasma 3d that boasted a 600hz refresh rate and I was not impressed, the was far too much flicker. I loved the LG cinema 3D tvs that have 120hz plus, but the are twice the cost of this tv.I hesitated with this Curtis tv because of its 60hz refresh rate, but here is what I have found:This tv requires a little more fine tuning to avoid flicker. I have tested it out with Tangled & On Stranger Tides Bluray 3d and they both look great.The 3d conversion feature is a step up from my lg monitor which relyed on software for conversion. This Curtis tv will natively convert regular bluray to 3d with no loss in quality. The image does not \"pop\" when converting 2d to 3d, but the depth is impressive. There again this tv may need individual configuration depending on the movie.I paid 449 at Kmart for this tv. If you can find a similar deal or make amazon do a price match, you have a steal!Note: I use a pc based system for Bluray 3D playback.Update: I noticed some \"crosstalk\" when displaying some bluray 3d movies. I updated my graphics hardware to NVIDIA GTS 520 1gb dedicated. This enabled me to do frame packing on the tv (1080p @ 24hz). Refresh rate seems low, but I said to myself at least 5 times \"I can't believe how good this looks\". I suppose you will have to tweak it somewhat to your configuration.", "Date": "May 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "So Far So Good...until the warranty ended", "Author": "Chicken Denchers", "ReviewID": "R23M7U0VX4OI1B", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for about a month and so far I can say I have no real complaints.  The visual aspect of this tv is great for the price range, and the passive 3D is a nice extra as well.  The sound quality of the speakers is absolutely horrendous, so if you do get this you HAVE to get external speakers of some kind, which is the main reason I give it 4 stars and not 5.  There has been an odd refresh issue that will sometimes (albeit rarely) occur but I think that has to do with a software problem with streaming to my PS3 from my PC rather than a problem with the tv itself, but if it persists I'll update my review accordingly.EDIT: Nevermind, the issue is in fact a problem with the tv itself.  Dealing with Curtis' customer service was a nightmare, but fortunately Amazon's was great as usual and let me return it since it was defective.", "Date": "May 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Stay Away from this Company", "Author": "Andy Dufresne", "ReviewID": "R3VL3GHET3AKJI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this item on Amazon, when it arrived, there was no remote control in the box, and no instruction manual.Amazon's solution to that problem was to send me another television, and they told me to take the instruction manual and remote out of that box, then return that television to Amazon.  This is a huge package (\"Team Lift!\" across the box), so this is a real pain in the a** solution.  The second television arrives, also with no remote control, and no instruction manual (I'm not an idiot, i checked all crevices of the styrofoam, everything).  The box says there's a remote control inside.  If you look up the instruction manual online for the LCD4299A, it talks about the remote on the first page.I called Curtis corporate office in Canada, explained to the lady who answered that they have a real problem, and that Amazon will probably pull the product because these items are missing in all their packaging, and she transfers me to someone's voicemail, obviously didn't think it was important enough to let me speak to a live person.So then I call Curtis 1-800 number, which is obviously India.  After reciting the spelling letter by letter of my name and address 3 times, the CSR was about to send me the replacement items, when all of a sudden he couldn't hear me, so he hung up on me.  Had to call again, the second CSR wanted me to call Amazon again, I explained Amazon's only offer of help was to take everything back, finally convinced him to send me the 2 items, and it took 5 times of telling him my address before he got it right (the computer kept telling him it wasn't a valid address).  I have no officially wasted a few hours of my life on this, and am not happy at all.If you don't need a remote control or a user manual, then ignore my review, this is probably the perfect TV for you.", "Date": "May 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "One of the best TV's out there!", "Author": "A. Fernandez", "ReviewID": "R17MN70VL30LD6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After a huge dissapointment with 2 different sets of the Sony 46EX720 model ordered from Amazon (Sony's lack of quality control, not Amazon's fault at all), and with the biggest frustration I placed an order for this TV. I thought this would be a crappy set with mediocre picture and even worse 3D images. But for the price, I took a chance... Well, this turned out to be one of the nicest pictures picture quality TVs I have seen ever... Who is this Curtis International guy? I have no clue. The TV is made in China, like anything else you buy these days, but has all the trimmings of your regular HDTV sets with 3D built in, for about $500. I tried with Direct TV 3D signal, with Time Warner cable, with blu-ray 3D (that Narnia movie)and with stuff I got from the internet. I just could not believe my eyes... it is so vivid and real! and it uses the passive glasses type (the same that you get from the 3D theatres). It comes with 3 glasses from the manufacturers (design of the glasses are the best I have seen so far)however, the 3D glasses from the theatre seem to render the best 3D and best color. I previously had bought other 3D HDTVs (Mitsubishi, Sony 800 line model, Samsung Plasma) so I have a good reference to compare. I have tested it only for one day, but I am extremely impressed with what this low priced set has to offer. Doing an internet search, I noticed that the places who sell this model, have already ran out of stock. I guess I am not the only one who made the amazing discovery of such a great 3D performance (and 2D is algo very good)for about $500.The only thing that I don't like is that the base will not swivel. Which is kind of a silly, considering that it is one of the common features in this type of devices.Kudos to this \"Curtis\" guys, and shame on Sony for making 3d TV sets of such a crappy quality and claiming features that do not work not even half decent, and still ask 3 times as much.Thank you Amazon, for carrying this wonderful TV at such a low price, and $4 for next day delivery on such a big/heavy item.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "DONT BUY ANY CURTIS PRODUCT", "Author": "Abby Reese", "ReviewID": "R2U1NSDTP3EA77", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this tv and was told it was compatible with apple products and i only had to buy the correct hardware to connect the two. WRONG. After three hours on the phone with their customer service people, I get four different answers.

They have no clue what's going on...it's 2014 for Christ's sake.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "OK", "Author": "W. Gentry", "ReviewID": "R1ITM316QN4DFS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Anyone who has ever seen the picture on a top of the line Hitachi or Pioneer Kuro plasma, or even a top of the line Panasonic LCD, would know this set isn't anywhere close to being top of the line.  That being said, it does look better than the 720P LG that it replaced.  I was surprised that my PS3 recognized the set immediately as being 3D since the PS3 forums have several complaints about other 3D TV brands not being recognized by a PS3.  The passive 3D at this price point is why I purchased this set and it works.  The screen is bright and sharp and there's no doubt it's a 1080P screen.Unfortunately, there are way more negatives than positives with this television.  The feature set is very short.  The menus have the same look and format of software that was used on Panasonic televisions in 1997. It's like stepping back in time not only in look, but in options.  Your choice of color correction is limited to tint control.  There is very little in the way of black level correction either.  If you spend some time adjusting brightness and contrast, you will eventually get an acceptable picture.  I'm sure this panel is used on other brands of televisions and can achieve much better black levels with better software and electronics, but that's why this one is so much cheaper.The worst issues include the absolutely horrible NTSC tuner.  If your cable company is stuck in the dark ages like mine is then some of the channels will still be analog.  On several analog channels the audio would go in and out like the tuner couldn't lock in on the channel frequency. I solved this problem by getting a $10 VCR from the thrift store and use if for it's NTSC tuner and it works great.  That's pretty sorry that an old VCR has a better tuner than this TV.  The other sorry thing is the speakers, you'll need to buy some external ones.  I have a 21 inch Emerson in the office that sounds better than this TV.The final issue is the screen does have quite a bit of light bleed in the lower left hand corner.  You won't notice it in the day time, but it is very visible in a darker room.  This is a fairly common problem on low end televisions and I figured I would see some on this one.I did up my rating by one star after owning this TV for awhile.  Despite it only having a 60khz refresh rate it is amazingly good at reproducing 3D from a PS3.  The PS3 automatically adjusts for 3D content to be displayed on the TV.  This is very good feature and the 3D really comes out at you.  I really like having Zombies disintegrate right in my living room and in another movie snow appeared to be falling on the couch.  It's a shame the studios don't release more 3D content at a reasonable price.  The poor black level (1000-1 contrast), the cheap speakers, and cheap remote are what prevents me from rating this any higher.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$723.48", "Features": "42-Inch LCD 3D TV, 1080P\nIncludes, 3 x 3D Glasses,\nConnections: HDMI x 3, VGA, YPbPr, AV Audio/Video, PC Audio & RF Coaxial Out\nMulti Language On-Screen Display, Sleep Timer Function, Bass, Treble, Balance Controls\nWall-Mount Ready, Limited warranty 1 year parts and labor", "Name": "Curtis 42-Inch 1080p 60Hz 3D LCD HDTV, Includes 3 x 3D Glasses", "ImgURL": "http://218.201.42.40:8080/ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41nfbdsYMJL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005YVTLBO"}}
