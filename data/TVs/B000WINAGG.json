{"Reviews": [{"Title": "GREAT TV FOR THE MONEY!", "Author": "Sean T. Johnston", "ReviewID": "R3EOAK8BR05BN9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been researching HDTVs for the past 6 months before finally, settling on this model.  I decided to go with the Plasma over the LCD mainly, because plasma offers much better PQ and motion for the money and I didn't want to sacrifice size.  The new Pioneers are very nice but way too expensive if you ask me.  So it came down to the Samsung 5084 or one of the Panasonic 1080p models.  For a long time the specs of the Samsung had me leaning that way.  However, after seeing one in person I was not that impressed, it looked cheap.  Panasonic also has a much better track record for reliability when it comes to Plasmas (they are rated for 100,000 hours vs. 50,000 - 60,000 hours of other manufactures).  No knock on Samsung they make great LCDs check out there 71 or 81 series.The 3 current Panasonic models are the PZ77U, PZ700U, PZ750U.  The 3 models can all be purchased within about $250 of each other (MSRP range from $2800 to $3500).  The 77U and 700U are almost identical with the exception that the PZ77U has an anti-glare screen and the PZ700U has a slightly upgraded speakers package (who buys a 50\" plasma for speakers anyway?).  The 750U adds to the 700U a third HDMI input and more picture settings (I was going to go with this model but the HDMI input is right in the middle front of the TV?).  Panasonic has a very highly rated anti-glare screen, not to be confused with anti-glare coating found on the 700U and 750U; they are not the same thing.  I went with this model because the anti-glare screen actually increases the contrast.  So far I have had it for 3 months and been extremely happy with my purchase from 6ave.", "Date": "November 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "For $2000, you can't go wrong", "Author": "Scott Rodriguez \"sheismysin\"", "ReviewID": "R24FGJQPIY7BXA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was on sale at Circuit City for $2k. I almost thought something was wrong, but that was indeed the sale. I picked it up and almost immediately was disappointed by the lack of pop in colors compared to my LCD 4665.Turns out that I was just watching a bad source, in daylight. Once the night came, and HD channels were on...things got better - a lot better. I went to the store again to compare the picture on this to the 700 which has a glossy screen, and I honestly couldn't not tell a difference when looking at them from dead on. One looks like it has glass, and that's about it.The whites are not pure white on this, or hardly any other plasma. But the darks are yummy and perfect. SD stinks, but HD sources really shine. If you can get a good deal on this - you can't go wrong!I would like to see more control over the tweeking features, but the picture looks great, so I'm not complaining too much.I definitely prefer this to my old LCD...the motion on it is smoother - no blur when the camera pans. The darks are REALLY dark and uniform.

I'm happy to report that after two weeks of use the experience has been fantastic.  First off, the picture is just gorgeous.  Of course I expected that with HD cable and a Blu-Ray (PS3) player -- it's jaw-droppingly great -- but I was very impressed with the SD picture of this unit. Sure, it pales in comparison to HD, but the SD channels don't have that processed look that makes everything appear like it's been through a photoshop watercolor filter. I've seen that on a number of LCDs and plasmas before and it drives me nuts. Remember, they never will show a SD signal to you at most stores-- it's always a sharp HD signal. The good SD clarity is even more impressive for a 50\" model.I'm still in the break-in period-- trying to make sure the phosphors burn in easily; I downloaded a burn-in disc from eaprogramming.com, which has been helpful.Lastly, a few nice words for the purchase experience via Amazon and 6ave: The unit was shipped to my home in Michigan within a week; upon delivery the unit was inspected as required; everything was great. I'd certainly use 6ave again.", "Date": "March 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent 50\" Plasma", "Author": "rdoggy", "ReviewID": "R3LSHROKTL79P9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After much research and actaully seeing the 700U, 750U, and 77U in person I settled on the TH-50PZ77U. The anti-glare screen works excellent in my environment. I have a fair amount of indirect light during the day, with light colored walls and hardwood floors there is high possibility of glare. This TV handles it brilliantly and I no longer have any issues watching during the day.I was able to view all 3 models at a local Best Buy Magnolia so I had pretty much decided on the 77U when CC dropped the price down on sale to 2k after the Super Bowl. It was a no brainer and I do not regret it one bit.I have an Onkyo TX-SR705 so I did not need the additional HDMI input of the 750U. I ran a break in disc when I wasn't watching it for 150 hrs then had it calibrated and WOW does the picture pop on this thing! I can't believe how good the black levels are either. As good as it looked on the show room floor it looks even better now. Unless you have an extra couple grand to throw at a Pioneer you can't do any better than a Panny plasma in my opinion.Connected devices: Onkyo TX-SR705, Panasonic DMP-BD30, Xbox 360 Elite, DirecTV HR-20", "Date": "February 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "EXCELLENT TV - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED", "Author": "M.

Even though we still don't know the potential this beauty offers, because we received it just a few days ago, I can assure you that this is the best tv we have had until now. Standard image is superb and its design is very classy and beautiful, it got slim and invisible speakers on the sides which make it look a little wider than other models, and more sober. Tv image definition is very clear, specially with directv, colors are vibrant and clean, and the most outstanding thing to notice is the depth of the blacks, which you will immediately notice when you turn the tv on, this makes a big difference in comparison with other tvs that aren't full hd. Back connections are plenty, you can connect from component or composite, passing through coaxial, and even hdmi. There is an SD card reader on one of the sides to view digital pictures from your digital camera. The user guide is very precise, easy to understand and clear, and it comes in English and Spanish too. But please, connect this magnificent gem to a good home theatre system and, if you can, placed in a proper space, then you will get to yourself the nearest cinema experience you can have at home, you will feel like you were in the movies, I can guarantee.

After about 5 more minutes the unit would power off entirely and the power LED would just blink seven times. Would have to unplug the TV from the wall to get it to power back on. After doing some google searching for power issues this appears to be an issue with many Panasonic TV's (didn't see this while researching the product pre-purchase). The Panasonic help line was friendly and helpful and tech was out within 4 business days to repair so I give them some credit for that. Tech has to replace one of the system boards to fix.  Talking to the repair guy he confirmed this to be a common issue he has seen with Panasonic brand plasmas (appears to not just be this particular model). Luckily mine was under warranty.

The digital picture quality when I watch Nova on PBS is absolutely stunning.I only have two small complaints:1)  The TV will not tell me what resolution the current channel is that I am watching.

There should be a single \"Speakers On/Off\" button on the remote.Other than that, this TV is great.

I wouldn't rate the built in speakers as being very good but if you're running the sound through you're own amp, it won't make any difference.
