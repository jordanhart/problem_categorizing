WTF.....I had an older Samsung but I am pleased and disappointed at the same time. The first thing I noticed is that this TV is not as vivid and crisp as my Samsung (LN40A530P1F) but after about a day or so, I realized this TV has 3D without glasses.... It is called 2D to 3D conversion. It only happens during a close up pic but it doesn't look bad and actually is a great feature. I was saying to myself something looks off but looks good... It is the 3D. Sometimes it looks better than other times, but I am very happy with this purchase. Has a lot of picture settings to tweak it as you like.The only reason I am disappointed is because I am used to the crisp, clear and vivid pic coming from the Samsung. But I will say the Samsung crapped out after just 4 years.....Only had this a few days but I am happy. Just hope it lasts 5+ years like TVs are supposed to..... Maybe I'll update this 5 years from now to let you know......", "Date": "September 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exceptional Experience", "Author": "Tim", "ReviewID": "R1DMMH5DQGUGJE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is replacing a Sony 51 inch.  Picture had gotten bad and was difficult to watch when daylight was in the room.This new 50 inch Vizio is what we needed.  It is a perfect fit in our entertainment wall.  Our room is aprox 15 X 25.  This TV  is large and clear enough that it is easy to watch from the 25 ft end of the room.I used the Audio out to connect to our surround sound.  That was very easy to do.The only thing I can't offer is for the longevity of the TV.  As a new purchase we look forward to many years of enjoyment and hope it continues to provide the quality picture and sound we are getting now.Another plus with this Amazon purchase was the two years interest free offer available with an Amazon card.  I will pay more than the minimum, but the minimum payment will be under $30 a month.  Exceptional value at the offered price.Get yourself one today!!", "Date": "June 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00A2FXUEQ"}}
