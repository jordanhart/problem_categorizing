I am happy with all the features except the Format adjustment, and this is why I gave it four stars.  Since I have another TV (different brand) in our family room, I find the format adjustment does not adjust as well as our family room TV.  By this I mean I cannot move the picture up and down, and often the format leaves black bars no matter which format it is in.  This does not happen with all channels, but with the family room TV the format adjustment can remove black bars if so desire, which I am sure most people would prefer.  For the price, I cannot complain and since this is a TV I only watch now and then, I can deal with the formatting issue.", "Date": "February 19, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$199.99", "Features": "LED Backlight High Definition LCD Display\nConvenient Side Input Panel with HDMI\nStereo Speakers / 5 Band Equalizer / Auto Volume Leveling\nUSB for JPEG Playback\nAV output: Headphone out", "Name": "Magnavox 19ME601B/F7 19-Inch 720p LCD TV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31EpbTcZUKL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005450YTS"}}
