This is not the case. I bought the 39\" version and could not be happier. just a heads up, i bought this TV to use for my computer and xbox360 only.Pros:-Very slick design-Amazing 1080p, watching blu-ray movies is a treat, everything is clear-Extremely cheap for the specs, will no find another TV for same price with same specs.Cons:-Sound sucks. But hey! it's a television! made for viewing, not listening.-Stand does not spin and is made of glass.. yikes, careful not to break it. However it looks really nice.-Not too many picture adjustable options!!!!!!INFORMATIVE FACTS!!!!!!!!!!-In case you didnt do your research and is skeptical about buying this TV, it is a chinese manufacturer, that uses SAMSUNG screens in their TVs. The reason they are so cheap, is because they have a really good screen and no super duper features. If you need something to display movies and such, this is perfect.-If you are going to use this TV as a monitor, BUY IT!, People are not aware that if they try to buy a 120hz tv, it will be useless with their computer, as computers output at 60hz. In fact, a 120hz is actually lagging with a PC. Personally, if you ask me, watching a movie with 120hz just looks weird. It is only useful if watching sports. This TV gives the best movie experience.-I fixed the lame sound quality by purchasing logitech LS21 speakers 2.1. I gotta say, that it sounds absolutely amazing. Unless you are one of those weirdos that listens specifically to get some crazy ass sound, get those speakers and plug em in. Problem solved. No need to spend $$$$ on a home theater system.XBOX!:For some reason my games looked pretty bad when i started playing them. Heads up!: adjust the sharpness of the TV to about 25% so it's is not as sharp. The best auto setting to be on is \"cinematic\" if you do not like fiddling with the TV.PC!: for me, I am using a HDMI to DVI cable from my graphics card but for some reason it doesnt auto detect the TV on boot. (on ATI graphics cards). EDIT: just found the solution. Set your graphics card software to scan for TVs on startup.Overall: This is a pretty awesome TV, especially for the price.UPDATE: 1/9/2013: TV is still amazing. Playing games on the 360 is still awesome. I got greedy and bought z-5500 speakers from craigslist and a coax digital cable. I now have a massive home theater with about $1000 off of what it would cost me originally. *drool*Update: 4/1/2013: Sold this thing in perfect working condition and bought the 55\" version.", "Date": "July 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "An okay HDTV", "Author": "Tomboy", "ReviewID": "R30ZB2DWLIX6C7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this TCL brand LE39FHDF3300TA television one week ago and listed below is a brief summary of my observations to date.- The screen does not have anti-glare treatment so room lights are annoyingly visible while watching TV.- Off axis viewing is not good. There is obvious color and contrast shift when viewing the screen off center.- Digital audio output uses S/PDIF coaxial cable connection. This might necessitate purchasing a converter if you require TOSLINK fiber-optic or analog lineout connections.- Digital audio settings are provided for Dolby, PCM, or off. This should accommodate most home theater or stereo systems.- Poor sound quality using the internal TV speakers, equalization adjustment has little effect on the sound.- There are no analog audio outputs other than headphones.- TV dissipates very little heat, uses LED backlighting.- When installed into a cabinet the edge of the screen could be obscured by the cabinet depending on cabinet size. The screen sits back 3 inches from the front edge of the TV stand.- Easy to setup and use, light weight.- Low price when compared to other brands.- Two year warranty is longer than most assuming service is available when needed.TCL LE39FHDF3300TA 39-Inches 1080p LED HDTV with 2-Year Limited Warranty - Black", "Date": "July 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "TCL 32\" LED", "Author": "SRN", "ReviewID": "R1XRSRPL8W91SM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Just recieved this tv today and I'm very impressed with the picture quality.

The UPS delivered item was not damaged in any way, nor were its internal contents (as I read in some reviews for TCL Tvs).My HDTV is the TCL 39\" (3300) model which sold for $329 compared to $418 for the 43\" TCL model. I didn't think a couple more inches were worth so much more in cost. I do need to say that Amazon was selling the TCL 42\" model for $369, (but they ran out of stock just before I ordered, so maybe that sale will return, it's the best deal).My previous HDTV was a 32\" RCA (720p with 5000:1 contrast) that I got at Walmart for $899 five years ago, but it died so I wanted a cheap replacement and this one was the one I chose. The setup on the TCL tv was easy, just put  the bottom glass stand on with 4 screws, connect a couple cables and turn on the TV. It goes through a quick channel scan and that's it. The picture is quite an upgrade from my previous RCA HDTV, plus its a much larger screen size. My old RCA had problems getter all the local broadcast (free to air) HD channels, but this thing is picking up all of them from as far away as 90 miles WOW!The sound quality to me seems NORMAL for a TV of this price. My TCL model doesn't sound thin or tinnie, nor does the TCL volume go extremely loud. But there are 2 audio output options, to resource the sound out to other locations by using either the headphone jack, or the SPDIF connections (SPDIF is a type of digital audio interconnect cable)(S/PDIF: check it on Wiki for more info). So if you want high quality digital output, you have to use these 2 options.Remember the thinner TVs get, the thinner their speakers become, and this reduces their sound quality. So think about adding a cheap sound-bar (with or without a sub-woofer) to your TV, this works really well to improve your sound at a minimal cost. I'm thinking of adding a sound-bar with a wireless sub-woofer that also has built-in Bluetooth (like the LG NB3520A model). This sound-bar can also be used for my wireless tablets and phones to stream media to wirelessly, by way of its built-in Bluetooth. Another cheap one: iLive ITB382B Bluetooth Sound Bar with AM/FM Radio - both of these soundbars are available at Amazon.comThe remote isn't perfect, they really don't use the 4 arrows on it properly, but it does have a couple of extra features that are nice like a channel info button and channel guide button, so you can see what programs are coming up.There's a large orange power light in the bottom right corner that can be annoying at night in a bedroom, but I just put a piece of black electrical tape over it.The 39\" screen is a perfect size for the bedroom or living room, its 1080p,  100,000:1 contrast ratio is beautiful and the 1/2\" trimmed edge only compares to the newer, more expensive, HD models coming out now. This Tv's thickness and weight is good for tv stands, tables, and in some cases wall mounting, but most people might want to goes with a thinner model for wall mounting. It is an LED tv so its weight is on the lighter side.Yes this TV's cost is cheaper than most and you only get 2 HDMI inputs, but the performance, screen size, beauty, picture quality, and lack of problems, make this TV well worth its price. The Energy Guide rating is $11, so it uses very little power.Generally its hard to get 5 star reviews from me, and maybe I will come back later and edit it if I have problems, but so far its what I review it to be. A person cannot expect the world for $300 plus dollars, but for me its a KEEPER!", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "The New Vizio", "Author": "Pocono Bob", "ReviewID": "R10ICGF0735UPW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I began to buy flat panel TV's several years ago, the prices were still pretty high.  I researched & researched.  I came upon the Vizio line & my 1st purchase was a 50\" 1st generation plasma.  I was very happy w/ the set, so my next purchase was another Vizio.  A few years had passed and technology advanced some more & I ended up getting a 42\" LCD and to this day the picture is great especially for a 2nd set in our dining room.  The picture was/is better than the original plasma.  I found Vizio to be a great bang for the buck at the time & pretty much still think the same.OK, onto the TCL.  I wanted another TV for our bedroom.  I researched and stumbled on the TCL brand which I'd never heard of before.  I read every review on every TCL TV I saw that was remotely interested in.  I found that it's a Co from China.  I also read that the actual screens are Samsung.  I didn't need anything special for our bedroom since TV viewing is minimal.  I wasn't looking for a TV w/ all the bells & whistles by any strech.  From day 1 of researching flat panel's I was amazed at how many didn't include a timing system.  I mean there's a clock, so how difficult could it be - right?  It's a digital world now!  Well, I still find many TV's these days that don't so you can imagine my surprise when setting up this 39\" TCL last night and seeing that there were settings for not only the clock, (w/ a simple to use)sleep timer, but also Power On settings as well.  I was thrilled especially being that this purchase was to be for the bedroom.  Sleep timer - Off, and Pwer - On when it's time to get up.  Simple concept I know, but very much appreciated.The packaging was in very good condition and the TV arrived undamaged & very timely.  When I unpacked the content the very 1st thing I did was connect an HDMI cable from my satellite provider, and plug the power up.  I never even cared about putting it on the stand, b/c I read the negative reviews about this TV not even powering up, or upon intial power up, that was it.  I was pleased to see it functioned normally, disconnected the cabling and proceeded to the install of the stand.  Pretty simple.Set up took only a few brief minutes to get familiar w/ navigating & locating all of the settings.I changed channels a many times to compare the quality of the picture and set up the \"Picture setting\" to my liking.  The sound isn't the best, but not many TV's these days are.  That's what external systems are for and mine was already in place so one more cable connection & I was finished w/ this installation after I programmed the remote, which took no time.I find that the picture & ease of use of this TCL is like the Vizio of old, \"the best bang for your buck!!!\"  I would defintley give another TCL a try in the future especially w/ it's competetive price and what you get for it.  Keeping in mind it's only 24 hours old, but I couldn't be more pleased w/ this purchase.  I'll ammend this accordingly if need be after some time has passed, but upon my initial eval, I'm a a happy camper.I'll go as far as to date myself.  I am techical in nature 1st of all, but, I've witnessed the advent of the TV/technical advance from B & W to color consoles, to the bulky & heavy table top CRT's requiring a 2 man lift. Then onto the projection flat screens housed in a huge package.  Plasma, LCD & LED true flat panel TV's.  So I've seen them all & love the advancement of technology.  Not very long ago when researching a TV (in the middle of the pack) I found pretty much the cost to be approx $10/\".  That would put this set @ approx $400.  Well, enough said there!I would recommend this to anyone of my friends/family.", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Warranty?  Hardly.", "Author": "Cap'n Jan \"Cap'n Jan\"", "ReviewID": "R1VRWPS7Y12HQ1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Update:  2012-12-09:  We got the TV back.  Rather we got A TV back.  It isn't the model we had, it is the 'replacement' model, newer, and it is not compatible with the laptop we use for it.  However.  It is back, apparently they read the review ;->  I must say that the picture on the replacement is very crisp.  No dead pixels out of the box, but we will see how long it lasts.  I WILL update the review if we have further problems.My original review stands.  Four months is too long to wait for service on a warranted consumer product.  If they weren't going to fix the original it should have, at the very least, been replaced within the month.  Ludicrous.  Perhaps they noticed the flurry of one star reviews...Update:  It is November 7, 2012:  Our TV has been at the 'repair shop' (warehouse?  Garbage dump?) now since the first of August 6, 2012.  That makes it 3 months.In talking to my husband last night he said \"I bet the reason these TV's are so inexpensive is they bought up all the discontinued parts sitting around in China, assembled the TV's and sold them dirt cheap.\"  So what if they break?  They are disposable!  Trouble is they don't inform the customers that they are throw-aways.  Instead they talk about their warranty!  And their Customer Service!!!.  The disposable TV theory makes sense to me particularly given the treatment we have gotten.  I am putting this review on EVERY TCL TV even though we only bought the 42 inch version.In looking at other reviews (and not just on Amazon) TCL has this same ho-hum attitude about customer service for ALL of their TV's.  I promise to eat crow if we ever see that TV again, but I don't think I'll be burping feathers any time soon.  I would bet money we will never see that TV again.  I'd appreciate any comments where people have had satisfactory customer service - it might restore my faith that I will see that TV on the front porch in the next couple of years.----------------------------------My original review written in October still stands:When we set it up, we were very happy with the picture quality, there were a few dead pixels, but that doesn't show up much and we weren't concerned. But the whole panel died after only 6 months. We aren't big TV watchers either. The thing was on less than 5 hours a week.So we contacted TCL (after several tries to get them on the phone), they gave us the number of the repair shop we were to send this TV to. After several tries, I got them on the phone. They agreed to send us a box to ship it in (a whole other fiasco, but that's not to do with the TV).We received the packing box (after a couple of weeks). We packed it and sent it to them Fed-Ex the same day.Now the Big Wait begins. After 3 weeks I called (again, several times, for several days before an answer). Oh, its here, it is in our shop and they are working on it. Sometimes it takes a couple of weeks because we are So Busy!!OK. Fine. We wait some more. Three more weeks. I call (yes, again, several times over a period of days before I get an answer). NOW there is a problem getting the part. But it should be in 'any time now'.Hmmm. So I wait some more. Another 3 weeks. I call (here we go again! several times a day, for several days -FINALLY an answer). This time someone let the cat out of the bag and told me that the 'panel' that my TV needs is on 'back order'. They have a warehouse full of TCL TV's waiting for this part. She was honest enough to say that it could be 3 months or 3 years before it is received. They simply do not know.Of course it is not the repair shop's fault. I am mad at them for not being more forthcoming, but it is TCL's fault for not providing proper warranty service - TCL simply does not care about customer service.I will update this review as things change, but things probably won't change. This week I am due to call again. I am nothing if not persistent.So, you can go ahead and buy a TCL TV, and you might get lucky and get one that works for a while. But then you can send it to the repair shop so it can keep mine company - in the 'warehouse full of TCL TV's needing repair'.Fair Winds,Cap'n Jan", "Date": "November 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Beautiful TV for a Budget Price", "Author": "Alksion", "ReviewID": "R13C68OACZ5L17", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned 3 TV's in the past 5 years, this one is by far the best investment I've made for the price, I have a 47\" LG and a 32\" Sharp and now this 39\" TCL....If you can get past the fact that it is a brand that you have never heard of then you will love it. I ordered this TV because I live (have a roommate) from China that is here to study. I asked him a lot about TCL and he said that it is very popular in China and a very good and trusted brand with good warrantees, he actually owns one in his house back in Beijing. Everything he explained to me made complete sense so I ended up purchasing it and wasn't disappointed, I was actually thrilled by it. I know a lot of people on here complain about thing but you can't please everyone right? Even the $5,000 Sharp TV's have reviews of people who weren't happy, common guys, electronics don't always work perfectly or satisfy everyone because we all know no matter what the brand, LG, Sony, Sharp, or TCL....electronics can fail and have problems but this comes with a 2 year warranty for free which is more then I got for my other TV's and I had to pay $200+ for them so this is really a sweet deal.Pros:- Stunning Visuals when picture is changed to \"Cinema\" and sharpness is reduced between 25-50,- Small bevel around the sides makes it look like an expensive TV- Picture quality is just as good as my $1,399 LG- It's relatively thin and has a very nice glas mount bottom, a very attractive TV to say the least- Piano black finish looks great in any room or entertainment system- 39 inches is just big enough for a room and gives a great picture without taking up too much room- Dirt Cheap TV with the quality of a $1,000 TV, what else are you looking for?Cons:-When the screen is all black you can see some light leakage on the sides but it doesn't affect the movie or game- The sound isn't that great but I fixed that by plugging in $30 Logitech speakers from Target and it sounds awesome now- Only has 2 HDMI ports, so if you have a lot of things to plug into it, like in a living room this may not be the TV you are looking for.- There really aren't any cons beyond that, everything about this TV blows me away for what I payed for it.Realize this, if you are a TV guru, this isn't he TV for you, go buy a $25,000 85\" Sony 4k screen. But if you're just your average joe or someone who appreciates great picture quality but either don't have a budget for a more expensive TV or you're just trying not to spend a lot of money, this is the TV for you.", "Date": "April 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best TV We've owned", "Author": "Joyce Miletic \"+\"", "ReviewID": "R3RFFOBXPOUTAN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Daily I hear my husband say how incredibly clear and detailed the picture is.

We are happy about that, as that is fairly important to us, when one wants to sleep and the other wants to watch TV.

I couldn't confirm that, but I did find that Samsung and TCL formed a partnership where each owns a 10%-15% stake in the other's production facilities, and that TCL manufacturers 2.55 million LCD displays for use in Samsung TVs each year. That gave me some comfort in TCL's quality, so I took the chance knowing I had Amazon's return policy as a safety net.Packaging:Fairly standard, though the glass stand was not secured properly and came loose during shipping, partially ripping the plastic wrap around the TV. Thankfully, there was no damage.Build quality:The glass stand is heavy (perhaps half as heavy as the TV itself) and supportive with rubber feet on the underside. It does not slide, even on inclines, and the TV does not sway or wobble - it would be difficult to accidentally knock it over. The plastic around the TV itself is solid and does not seem likely to break without being hit or dropped. However, while it seems sturdy around the edges, the plastic does bow around the VESA mount in the back when pressed on - though it does not seem to compromise the strength/integrity of the TV.Picture quality:Out of the box, the picture quality was just 'ok' - colors were too bright/washed out and everything seemed pixelated. After I switched display modes to 'cinematic' and lowered the sharpness, along with some other tweaks, I upgraded my opinion of the picture to be 'very good.' Imagery is natural-looking with great white/black contrast, and fast-motion video (such as action movies and NASCAR) is smooth without pixelation or streaking (despite the 60Hz refresh rate). Plus, I have found no dead pixels, no backlighting leaks, and no significant image distortion when viewing at very wide angles around the room. Nevertheless, strong lighting contrasts within small regions (such as in dimly-lit scenes of horror movies) appear somewhat washed-out. And I would have preferred a matte display as this one is glossy seemingly without an anti-glare coating, so bright lights in the room can cause a distracting glare at certain angles. Still, these caveats are relatively minor and are to be expected in this price range.Sound quality:I was quite surprised how good and strong the sound was out of the box. I purchased this set fully expecting to pick up a sound system as well based on other reviews, but the downward-facing built-in speakers are loud and rich enough that I'm not going to. Thus far, I haven't had the need to turn it up above 40% in an average-sized living room to get an immersive experience. The only issue I've encountered is with the simulated surround sound feature - there is a very noticeable vibration/reverberation during louder scenes, so I disabled it in the settings and haven't had a problem since.Features:I'm running everything through a new Google TV box, so its USB audio/image (sorry, no video) playing abilities, channel labeling, sleep timer, etc. are of little concern to me. However, it does have the standard manual picture (brightness/contrast/sharpness/backlight/color/tint/temperature) and sound (equalizer/balance) settings. In addition, it offers auto-volume leveling (based on the content), dynamic backlighting (based on content), and a dynamic light sensor (based on room lighting). I was surprised to find the TV had the latter since the model comparison chart here on Amazon said it didn't have that feature - but it does (sensor is in the lower left corner) and it seems to work well! Volume is steady and backlight transitions are very smooth.Remote:The included remote is light, easy to use, and offers good range, though I use the universal remote from my Google TV instead. I know others have had issues using their cable/satellite remotes to adjust the TV, but the Google TV remote easily controls power on/off, volume, and mute, which are the only native TV controls I need most of the time. For settings and input change, I still revert back to the included remote.Warranty:TCL's 2-year warranty is longer than any competitor's, and does offer the possibility of in-home service (at their discretion). Unfortunately, they only pay the cost of shipping back from the repair facility, not to it, if they elect not to do in-home repair, which seems to be the industry standard. Thankfully, a SquareTrade warranty covers all shipping costs in addition to extending the coverage term. ~$10/yr is reasonable to enhance the default warranty and ensure the TV's longevity, though hopefully I never have to use either.Other:- The ultra-slim bezel looks great, as does the glass stand, both of which are nice selling points. It's hard to tell from the product photos, but the glass stand actually has a black coating on the bottom, so only the outer 1/4\" is transparent, which looks quite good.- This model is more energy-efficient than every other TV I looked at and generates very little heat after extended use, making it even more budget-friendly.- It takes 10+ seconds for it to turn on, during which it briefly displays an oversized TCL logo, but once powered up it is pretty responsive.- Unplugging the TV occasionally resets the picture settings while leaving all others intact - a mild inconvenience.- The power light in the bottom left corner is on when the TV is off and off when the TV is in on - very counter-intuitive.Bottom line:This TCL has its quirks, but it's quite a good HDTV, especially given the price range, and one I'd definitely buy again. If you're considering paying the premium for a more recognizable brand as I did, give this TCL a try first. If you don't like it, send it back - Amazon will even pay the return shipping!

I use this with DirecTV, my PS3, and my MacBook Pro, and all of them look amazing, especially the stuff in BluRay and 1080P. The screen is bright and vibrant, has good contrast, and good color.

Again, my friends 2,000 Samsung LED does not have great sound either, which is expected from a thin TV. The bass, mids, and treble can all be adjusted in the EQ, even though you really can't get too much bass out of it. However, I did get it to sound better than the default settings. Again, just take some time to adjust the settings.Physical Setup & Appearance: To me, the TV looks great! It's very thin and the thin bezel is awesome. I have read a lot of reviews regarding the stand, and how is it hard to setup. I did not encounter this problem at all. It took me about 5 minutes, if that, to get the stand on. The screws require a little strength, but nothing compared to what other people exaggerated about it. Also, the stand is glass and is very sturdy. I was looking at a Sceptre TV as well, and there were many complaints I read about how the plastic stand was not sturdy. Trust me, if you put this stand on right, it's defiantly not going anywhere.Overall this a excellent TV, especially for the price. I recommend anyone pondering over whether to get it to just get it.", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "(PICTUREs/PROs/CONs)The Creative Life 39 inch LED TV, BUY IT!", "Author": "gabe", "ReviewID": "R3PBC7U30KTOH6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "On a budget but you want a new/secondary HDTV?

It was only $275 plus about $40 shipping (no tax), which is a good amount below the new price. It was not in perfect shape, but it works fine and looks great. The only problem with it was one of the tabs of the top of the plastic frame was popped out, and the screen was warped slightly outward there. This caused a bright line (from the backlight bleeding through) to show up at that area along the top edge of the screen. All I did to fix it was remove a few screws from the plastic frame and pop the clip back into place. Now everything is perfect except for a little piece of dust that got down into the screen. I can only see it when I am less than a foot away, so no problem there. Otherwise, the thing is in new condition, with the plastic wrap still covering the glass base. Shipped faster than expected and came well-packaged in original box.As far as features go, this TV is pretty basic, but that's exactly what I was looking for. It looks really good for $300. The settings/remote are easy to navigate, and it plays well with external speakers and PC hookups. If you're messing with the picture, don't get \"brightness\" and \"backlight\" mixed up. If you turn the brightness down to about 40 and the backlight to 100, you get good blacks and nice bright colors. I had never heard of TCL before researching this one, and I don't know much about their customer service, but this TV is of solid quality, and I have no problem recommending it. I give it 5 stars despite the frame tab issue because I expected as much buying it used.--UPDATE--Concerning the customer service, I was pleasantly surprised. I had a question about hooking up my computer to the TV using an HDMI cable (wasn't displaying full screen). I submitted the question via their website, and I wasn't sure it would work, so I also called them. I got through on the phone quickly, they took my question, and said they would call me back within a day or so. The next day, I got a response to my email, as well as a call back about my question. They were extremely patient and helpful. I had given them my graphics card model and they figured out it was a problem with that, not with the TV. I adjusted my overscan on my computer as they suggested, and voila, a perfect image! They were basically helping me troubleshoot my graphics card, which has nothing to do with TCL. Impressive service.I have heard bad things about people who need physical service done (warranty work) and long delays in replacement parts and such. However, I suspect this has more to do with the authorized technicians then TCL itself, as well as the fact that this company is not quite as well-established as other brands like Samsung or LG. They seemed eager to help though, and I definitely will consider TCL for future purchases.--UPDATE--15 months later, still going strong with no issues.

Since a lot of people use external speakers, it may not be that much of an issue. For normal TV watching I managed to adjust the sound to the point where I can tolerate it without making me cringe (the wife thinks its fine.) I have a surround setup for movies and I *could* use that for the TV too, but it would be one more remote to use.The lack of inputs may not affect the many people either, but I have an older DVD player that doesn't hook to HDMI and this doesn't have S-video, plus I have older consoles systems that I hook up to it (SNES, Genesis, PS2 and they work fine with it).I hate it when new equipment makes me modernize my perfectly good old stuff!I give it 4 stars for the sound being pretty bad and lack of inputs, but after living with it for a couple months it seems to be a good purchase. I hope it lasts!Also, one problem that I have with LCD, plasma, LED TVs is the lack of screen protection. Some of the old glass CRTs had a protective piece of glass in front of the screen and they were far more resilient to impact than these new ones, and none of the modern TVs come standard with them. My other TV was permanently damaged by a pretty low impact to the screen (a marble thrown in the air and not at the screen). Not enough to break the glass behind, but enough to cause a vast amount of pixels to become stuck. So, I purchased a piece of clear plexi-glass, cut it to size and mounted it to the frame with velcro to protect against any accidental impacts.

I had some minor troubles, but they were easily fixed.First off, I had a hell of a time getting the stand on it till I realized the screws were self grooving screws and I needed to screw them directly into the plastic slots without the glass stand first. Also, I had my Playstation 3 plugged into HDMI 1 and not even 20 minutes, the picture when using the PS3 would go to grey static with no sound. I realized I saw it say \"HDMI/DVI\" next to the slot and tried my DVI to HDMI cable I bought ages ago for my computer and moved my PS3 to HDMI 2 and voila, no problems ever since!So here are a couple things to consider when purchasing:1) Screw the screws into the slots without the stand first to create the grooves, then unscrew them and apply the glass stand.2) If you have problems with a device via HDMI going to a quiet grey static screen, switch to the other HDMI port and use the top one for a computer or other device that wont fuzz out.Other than my couple of problems, I've really been enjoying my new 39\" TV.

If you need a lot of features/function from your TV such as Audio-out for your Coaxial and Optical ports, 4x HDMI ports, 4x Component ports, and built-in functions like picture-in-picture or program guides: do not buy this TV. This TV comes with the bare essentials and you should treat it as much when deciding. Thankfully there's a built-in digital antenna so picking up digital channels is possible.The speaker quality is below average. You can tolerate it but it sounds like the speakers are coming out of a pipe rather than naturally coming from the TV itself. The TV comes with headphone jack-in: What I did was disable the TV speakers and connected my Logitech Z5500 to the TV. TV speakers should only be a deciding factor for you if you intended to use them primarily.

This things picture quality destroys my 37\" widescreen 1080p Samsung, which admittedly is 7 years old.  At this time I have no regrets about buying this one, even considering getting one of the versions with Netflix built in for the bedroom at some point in the future.  I will be updating this if anything changes.  On a no name product, one only has reviews to go off of, so if longevity is a problem for the TV or I have any other problems I will update to make sure people have the best possible info to go off of.  Side note, if you already have a receiver close to your TV, there is a cable that you can get to run two channel (stereo) output out of the TV to run through your receiver so you can get better sound, because the sound is definitely a little tinny.  That is for those of us with dinosaurs for audio system (Dolby Digital and older)  If your receiver is a nice one and has HDMI audio AND video switching, (please make sure it does both, because HDMI carries both signals, that does not mean your audio equipment will output both signals) then you can run HDMI from your video devices through your receiver and then out of that to the TV . . . not sure if you can turn off the speakers on the TV yet though, give me a sec to check that while I am thinking of it . . .yes, the speaker can be turned off.  This TV does not have ALL of the bells and whistles, but it covers the basics fairly well from what I can tell.  The remote is a little counter-intuitive in comparison with many of the remotes that I have used in the past, but despite the odd layout, it is something that is learnable, and it is fairly clearly labeled.  At this time this is rated as a great buy for the value minded TV purchaser.Update 03/23/13:  Less then a month after receiving, this TV turned itself off, and would not turn back on.  Previous reviews lead me to believe that you either get a good one, or a bad one.  This is my hope, and that the next one will function well, for much longer then around two weeks.  Rating is losing one star, which it may earn back if then next one works as it should.  It may also lose stars if I continue to have problems.Update 03/??/13:  Apologize for the lateness in getting this in here.  Thought I already had.  Wow in a box it is not, or was not for me.  The replacement model got to us quite quickly, and it's picture was bad from the start.  Where as the first model gave us an outstanding picture from the beginning, this one the color faded in and out.  On Netflix for the Wii it has a screensaver that just shows darker then the regular.  Best description I can give for the problem with the second model, is the shade on the screensaver should stay the same, and it went dark and lighter, unevenly the entire time.  On a second model from an unknown, with a history that is not terribly impressive, I wasn't gonna take a chance at a third time.Final Comments:  If you like your luck, you have a chance at a fine TV, if the first model shows any bad behavior, when you go for a replacement, get the name brand if you can afford it.  With the good reviews on here, you could end up being satisfied, however I won't give it a try again.  And if you have it replaced with the same model, you won't have the option of trading up if the second one is a dud as well.

I'm not a videophile, I just didn't have a TV and figured it was time to get one so I gave this a try.  I have been using it for 6 months now and have been pleasantly surprised.First, the negative.  I shouldn't have looked but since so many other reviews mentioned dead pixels my eyes couldn't help but go searching and sure enough, there it was.  A little dark speck that never seemed to go away, however it is only noticeable when you're right in front of the TV.  Move back about 5ft and even knowing exactly where it is I can't spot it.  Because of this, I decided it wasn't worth the hassle of returning the TV.  If you don't think about it I even forgot it was there for a few weeks.  As others have also mentioned the sound isn't great but it's certainly acceptable and on par with other thin TV's like this.  The USB input doesn't recognize any video files I've tried so I think its kind of pointless but it's there.I do feel the positives outweigh the negatives with this TV.  Despite the dead pixel, the picture is quite good.  Watching an HD movie from back on the couch is quite impressive and as I mentioned before, the dead pixel isn't noticeable.  It can be viewed from all angles and is even decently visible in direct sunlight.  I also use the HDMI to hook up to my laptop and the two link up flawlessly.  There's no lag with mouse movement or keystrokes at all.  The smart volume feature is basically just an audio compressor and for the most part works well to even out loud commercials.  The audio quality does suffer if listening through a good system and you can sometimes hear sounds that go above the compression threshold and get quickly brought back down, which can be annoying, but the feature can be turned off and it generally works ok.  It would be nice if it had RCA audio out jacks but adapters can be had to utilize the 1/8\" jack.  The 1/8\" jack is in a tight place that larger adapters won't fit in, so a skinny extension might be needed.I gave this 4 stars because of the pixel but considering the price that this thing goes for, I think it is still a good value for the occasional TV watcher or someone who wants a bigger computer screen.", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far so good!", "Author": "Cmodman", "ReviewID": "R3SQR3ZC4X7EDI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Will update after 30 days, then 3 months then so on...5/7/13 - 5 STARS!After just a few days, I love this TV for the price and quality!Shipping / Packaging: Top notch, very secure packaging, no dents on box, no dents on product, everything accounted for, nothing missing, does not look like used product, arrived ahead of schedule, very pleased.Set up: Super easy, didn't even look at instructions. Attached the neck to the TV then to the stand (screws all fit by the way, not sure what some others were saying about it not fitting, maybe a bad batch or use the wrong screws??) then that was it. Attached all the components and boom, after a few color and image tweaking which by the way, the presets were all fairly set nicely, but I'm more meticulous to use presets.TV: first thing I did was play some PS3 and it looked pretty awesome. From the distance I am from this TV, it looks just as good as my 60\" LED 1080p, not any better, but not far off from similar quality. Very smooth images, good refresh rate, no issues whatsoever. There are only 2 HDMI ports, which can be bummer for multiple components. I have my Apple mac mini to one HDMI and have to swap between the PS3 and XBOX for another HDMI. It has an audio port for headphones which is a nice feature, especially those with turtle beaches that need an audio out for wireless headphone. I had posted a pic of the set up in the images sectionSummary: overall, very impressed and pleased with this purchase. At only $200, it didn't break the bank, and it's a great addition to the house.

It looks like it would be really easy to scratch the screen on these staples as you unbox the TV, so be sure to discard the staples before lifting the TV out of the box!---Paid $329, which seems reasonable for this TV. Sure it's not top of the line but it blows my old 26\" 720p TV (bought for $500 in 2007) right out of the water.Most importantly the Samsung-sourced screen looks fantastic, contrast ratio is excellent, factory settings use rather high Backlight power which you might want to turn down for better blacks. As other reviews have mentioned, adjust the Sharpness setting to taste. Remarkably slim bezel around the screen.Switching between inputs is nice and snappy.There is an 'Auto Volume Control' setting that appears to be a compressor; handy if you're watching videos that are way too loud during the loud bits and way too quiet during the quiet bits.The orange 'power off' LED does not distract me, it's dim, in daylight you could mistake it for a daub of orange paint.Audio quality from the 3.5\" jack is fine; I am running it through Logitech LS21 speakers ( [...] ) which are great for the price.Some notes on the base plate:To attach the base plate you must lay the TV face down on a flat surface overhanging the edge and then attach the base plate with screws. As other reviewers have pointed out these are not high quality screws. You must use some force to screw them in; I could feel the threads biting into plastic, instead of threading into a nut. They look like wood screws, not machine screws. This seems like poor design; I worry that after a few assembly/disassembly cycles, the plastic will strip and the screws will stop holding the base on securely.However that's a minor quibble for me. The base is securely attached (for now); the TV is stable on the base; and I don't intend to transport it anytime soon.", "Date": "March 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Very Nice", "Author": "Dnice1", "ReviewID": "R31VQISNMP8FBA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price it's great, haven't had any trouble, picture is awesome.

This TV was the largest screen LCD that would fit into my 40\" cabinet and it has room to spare.Picture quality is excellent.  I find the angle of view to be exceptional.  I was working on the TV in the cabinet looking down at the screen virtually standing above the TV and I could make out the image just fine.  Some reviews were negative about angle of view so this may be a subjective measure or a factor that varies within the sample.  Mine is great.I use the SPDIF Coax audio out to my Yamaha receiver,  two Bose 901s and Bose rear/center speakers.  There are a lot of surround sound effects in an NFL football broadcast that would otherwise go unnoticed.  This is a flawless implementation of digital audio, as far as I can determine.  I use the over the air antenna rf signal input as well as HDMI from the HTPC and a Blu-ray player.I like the glass stand but, because this is in a cabinet, it keeps the screen from being flush with the cabinet front.

I did have a small amp laying around and a pair of small speakers that I built, so I was able to use the headphone output to drive the amplifier, and finally, the sound was in the same league as the picture.This TV still makes a very good purchase for my wife. It's replacing an old 32\" tube SD TV. She can live with the sound.

The only negative with this monitor was that it took a little effort to get our DISH TV remote to work with it.  TCL is not one of the standard options and the remote was not able to autosync with the TV. I read online that RCA codes work and I had some luck with those, but the best option was to call DISH and get their assistance.

The sound is poor, but just about every flat panel has sound issues. Open the equalizer in the audio settings and boost the two to the left up almost all the way gives a vast improvement. If you have a cable box like mine you can use the TOSLINK to hook it up to a sound bar.Do not buy this if you are using it for a family room because as other reviewers have mentioned when you get to the sides the picture fades. But in the bedroom both sides of the bed are in the narrow sweet spot cone which I estimate at no more than 35 degrees before fading begins. (35 may be generous)But within the cone I was surprised by how good the picture really is.Pros: 1.Price, price and price. 2. Nice picture in the small cone for the money. Surprised at how good I could get the picture with the very limited picture adjustment settings. Due to the limited settings it was very quick calibrating with Disney's Wow. But there is a big improvement. I turned the dynamic backlight, the Light sensor and the SABC to off. Sacrificing the little bit of energy savings for a better overall picture. These three items should be in the con section because I found the picture to be erratic when they were on. Over the air HD looks great, cable HD looks great, Blu Ray looks great and cable StandardDef is adequate but you must zoom the heck out of it to remove the black bars. With no up converter SD is what it is.Cons: 1. small viewing cone 2. I wish the HDMI cable inputs were on the bottom side of where the other inputs are. For wall mounting you could then route the HDMI cable behind and through the middle opening without having to bend it so sharp like you do now then hide the wires. Routing the HDMI cable from the side back to the middle and down puts way to much force on the connectors because of the sharp bend required.3. Some may be bothered by the shiny screen, I have a tilt mount and a bright light overhead that doesn't bother the picture one bit.4.More calibration settings would be nice but hey it's a 328 dollar LED 1080p TV.", "Date": "September 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice Quality - Speakers lacking though", "Author": "Andrew", "ReviewID": "RXXBTMSIHAZA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Great looking TV, looks like a samsung to be perfectly honest.

Out of the box, the TV looked slick, well designed, and had a nice heavy base if you're not mounting it. I was going to primarily use this as a computer monitor in my room and after hooking it up to the PC the screen powered on and I saw a bright crisp picture. The image it produced was great, almost on par with much higher priced lcd's. I played around with some settings and all seemed good. Then I was about to plug the antenna's coax into the back and noticed there was nothing there where the coax should be. Closer inspection showed the coax connector for the antenna line was never installed on my set and it left a gaping hole in the back. No idea how something so blatant could've been missed during manufacturing. I looked around the box and there was no loose parts and the box came to me in perfect condition. I was leaning towards a replacement set from Amazon until I played with the set a bit more and realized the second HDMI port also did not work. That port never detected any input from any source I plugged into it.If you get this set, be sure to test it out as much as you can within Amazon's return period.

I either received a crappy quality product or people's expectations went way down over the yearsI got the 39' model on my winter break from college, so I could only use it for a few days.  During those few days, I tried lying to myself that the quality was good, that it was a great buy.  My whole family came and told me that they didn't like it, but me being the stubborn person I am, insisted that that's how it should be.  So I went back to college, came back for spring break and used the TV again for a week.  During this week I really saw just how bad the quality was.The contrast is bad, the sharpness is bad, and the colors are decent.  I messed around with the modes but still this did not do anything.  I played a show that looks AMAZING on my 32' LG at college on this TV and it looked horrible.  There's no need to talk about anything technical here, if you go to any store with electronics and see their TV's on display, 80% of them will have WAY better display then this TV.Not only is the quality bad, but one thing that really irked me was that-the HDMI ports on this tv are not easily accesible at all.  If the covering on your connector part of your cable is even a little bit on the thick side, you'll have to push really hard and wiggle to make the connection, something that is very uncomfortable to do on a expensive TV.Eyes dont lie, I tried buying a TV that was cheap and good (reviews say that the reason why this TV is so cheap is because it has no extra features, but the quality is great) but there's no such thing.  trust me on this one and just save up an extra 100-200 dollars and buy namebrand(samsung/lg/panasonic) and you'll be much better off.", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't buy!!!", "Author": "Lori", "ReviewID": "R29GGRL1WVD7KE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this tv.

The default brightness is set to \"vibrant\" which makes the colors very vivid, perhaps not to everyone's taste though I prefer it overall.  The TV is very thin and light, easy to move.  Set up and control is painless.  If you are using a universal remote, RCA three digit codes should work if you cannot find TCL codes on the internet.  The sound is inadequate, as is the case with most all ultra thin LED televisions these days.  An external amplifier and speakers are recommended.  If using a stereo amplifier you will not find analogue audio outputs, which is also the case with other new HDTVs.  You can easily work around this by purchasing an inexpensive headphone jack to RCA audio cable, which plugs into the headphone jack and will connect to amplifier inputs.  The only downside of this is that the sound has to be separately turned on and off with the TV, a small inconvenience.The stand is not very well engineered.  The metal plate which fits over the four screw holes is not perfectly aligned.  I found that I could not screw in the screws until the plate was entirely flush with the base, with the result that the TV on its stand is a bit more wobbly then it should be.Like my other two HDTV's, the \"info\" button on the remote will not correctly resolve the input resolution of streaming video:  it always says 720p/1080i no matter what the source resolution.  It would be nice if the engineers would make this function actually work.Overall, the TCL gives a very nice picture.

Let me tell you how I use this device first: I only do on-demand streaming using a Roku box or as  wireless extended desktop to view content beamed from my laptop via bluetooth. I don't use it to watch the more traditional cable channels (I gave that up a few years ago). For my use, it works flawlessly. See other reviews for more technical details (I'm not good at that!).I looked over user reviews here carefully before buying. I am glad that I did not put much faith in some the critical reviews here (one of which seemed to be for an entirely different TCL product).First of all, the two HDMI input sockets in the back are clear of any obstruction, and I'm using both of them (However the user who had problems with that may have received a unit with the TV mounted loosely inside the outer console and it may have shifted during transit, making the HDMI sockets hard to plug into).Some are unhappy with the way the glass stand assembly. In my case, I found mounting the TV on its glass stand to be a breeze. I laid the TV face down on top of a bed with the stand stem hanging over the edge of the bed and mounted the base in less than 5 minutes. I had no trouble at all with the screws (however if you don't use the appropriate sized Philips screw driver, there might be problems forcing the screws in or stripping their heads). I also found the glass stand to be very stable for this unit. It is heavy glass and about 19-20 inches long and 10 inches wide (sorry, I can't find my tape measure at the moment for a more precise measurement).Additionally, one user rated this unit solely as a computer monitor and not as a TV set! Since computer monitors usually have higher resolution than TVs, there are bound to be disappointments! However, I can use the TCL LE39FHDF3300TA as extended desktop from my Dell Laptop using bluetooth, Intel WiDi software, and a Netgear Push2TV HD TV adapter (hooked up to an HDMI socket on the TV). Wow, it works wonderfully!Yes, the sound from the internal speakers is tinny, as to be expected from such a slim unit.

I wanted to wait and see a bit before reviewing it to make sure it wouldn't randomly die or some other factory defect. We used to have a 42' Samsung(with built-in side mounted speakers making it wing out) in the study but it was a little to big for the space and we just really wanted something  a bit smaller yet not to much smaller. After looking at a few Vizio and Samsung 32' & 34' I came across this guy. I was skeptical at first since I didn't know anything about TCL till then. After some research they seemed like an ok company so I took a chance.Lucky for me that chance panned out nicely. It came in a sturdy box padded on all sides and felt completely protected. The TV fits perfectly where we needed it to be. While not perfect I have to say it is worth every penny so far. The picture it self is great with some deep colors for what it is and the speakers are modest and won't wow you. My main complaint is screen uniformity. This is a problem that affects nearly every company of LCD/LED TVs. My previous Samsung had it, my 60' Vizio has trouble with it in the bottom right corner, and over all is something I would love to see more ironed out from all brands. Is it going to just kill your viewing experience? No, not for me especially when you consider this is a secondary TV. Yet it might bother some of the videophiles out there. I whole heartily recommend this TV to anyone looking for a nice 2nd screen or someone who needs a good one on a tighter budget.Overall:Pros: Great picture quality! Decent remote overall. Low profile bezel. Cheap in price not in quality!Cons: Screen uniformity. Speakers are modest. Glass stand(This is a con for me, you might like it though).", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV!", "Author": "idaguy", "ReviewID": "R31WED1V2LMF5X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the 43\" early 2013 from Amazon. Product shipped FedX and I had the television in 2 days.For starts, I reviewed a lot of televisions on Amazon; also, I visited a few stores and compared 39\" televisions to sizes slightly larger. Good idea as my wall is high/ wide. A 39\" would have been a mistake giver the wall field. So, I settled on the 43\" TCL.I noticed the 43\" on the Amazon websites view, bottom right, that there is a \"light on / off indicator\" that protrudes...my 43\" television appears like the 39\" pics same location. The TV I have has a manufacturing date of May/ 2012.I am very impressed with the quality of TCL. I did not search for dead pixels as a few television reviewers do. The TCL 43\" viewing experience is excellent, deep color saturation, sharp views. My house faces South, has a lot of glass...glare is minimal, not a problem at all! I did not change any of the factory presets.The sound...I do not know why a few people complain about the sound. The sound is very good! Maybe TCL improved the sound features.I have DirecTV as my provider. If you look at the other TCL reviews, it is a lengthy pain to coordinate with DirecTV to get your TCL television to work on the DirecTV remote. I tried the DirecTV route...gave up after a few tries. I \"Googled\" and found \"TCL Television + DirecTV Remote\" [...] My DirecTV remote is \"RC64\" and the RCA code \"11547\u2033 was the one I needed. The only issue is that I have to use the TCL remote to shut the television itself off.After reviewing other comments about sound, I just attached a \"Creative Labs I-Trigue 3330 2.1 Multimedia Speaker System\", that was not in use, into the \"audio\" jack on the back left side and that simple little \"cheap\" fix of 2 satellite speakers & subwoofer really improved the sound. I think any cheap speaker system should help a lot.I use my television in the \"traditional\" way, just normal broadcasting. I did purchase the 2 meter long \"AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI Cable\", but I have not the occasion to utilize You- Tube with the T.V.***rev.Aug8  Took the opportunity to view You- Tube via the HDMI cable. Must say that HD movies are an eye- opener on the 43\"...colors true, details very sharp.

I've been building computers and tinkering with electronics since i was a pre-teen. But i also cannot afford to purchase every toy i like. So when i needed a TV i did alot of searching, and i mean alot. Now all this talk about 120hz and 240hz being a necessity in a tv is a bunch of bull, you really are not going to notice a difference unless your constantly looking/expecting to see a difference in the TV's performance. I know that i can tell the difference while watching a hockey or football game but its very minimal and doesn't bother me enough to spend an extra 200-400 dollars for higher refresh rate. This TV literally surpassed my expectations more than i imagine. I have seen TV's like Seiki and Westinghouse that were god awful and for this TV to be in the same price bracket i figured i wasn't going to see amazing quality, I WAS WRONG! The colors are accurate, i dont see any light bleeding and the one thing i thought i was going to hate were the black levels but they are phenomenal. I dont understand how they were able to make this TV with this amount of quality for such a ridiculous low price. BRAVO TCL! BRAVO!My only gripe is i wish i had at least one more HDMI Input. But its not a deal breaker at all.For all you people complaining about audio quality........COME AND WAKE THE **** UP! Every new LED TV's sound is going to be inadequate even if you spend $2000 on your TV there is just no way your going to get Great sound out of a 2-3 inch speaker. JUST NOT HAPPENING!!I Have a Yamaha 6.1 Receiver, 2 8inch Yamaha Bookshelf Speakers, 1 klipsch synergy center channel, 1 Mirage Audio 8inch subwoofer, and 2 cerwin vega surround sound speakers, so my man cave is.....well a man cave.

We just don't watch cable. But with a baby on the way, and my wife staying home much more during the day - we wanted to give her an easy way to watch some local stations, movies, & netflix.I had been watching the TCL brand for awhile. In general I'm against buying no-name brands, but TCL seems to be shoving into the competitor's playing field. Supposedly Samsung makes the internal components and TCL puts a casing around them.Pros- The picture is great for me! Great clarity and 1080.- Menu is simple- Remote is laid out fairly well- Lots of input/output options- TV has a sleep function. Don't see that too often.- TV turned off automatically after we finished watching a movie. I was too lazy to go grab the remote and turn it off right away. After 5 or 10 minutes with the BluRay turned off, the TV turned off as well (it warned me first). I like that option.Cons- Remote is all black, buttons aren't color coded to group similar functions together- Internal speakers absolutely suck! Other people are not kidding. In general TV's this thin don't have great sound, but this is below average. Plan on buying a sound bar or hooking up to surround sound. I have a surround system, but the receiver currently is broken - so we're temporarily stuck with crackling speakers. (good thing we don't watch much television).- Dislike that HDMI has input on the side, cord shows off to the side a little bit - rather than coming straight out the bottom- No wifi or apps. I wasn't willing to spend a few hundred more for these features. I already have a Samsung BluRay that does these things, so I'm okay with the TV not doing it.Overall it's a great price.

For the record, 2 HDMI ports (one can come from a DVI cable), an RCA connection, a component connection (though you can't use both simultaneously, because it shares the audio jacks), and a digital coaxial audio out.This isn't really enough ports for the TV to be the center of your home theater, and I would strongly recommend you use an AV receiver in conjunction with this.

I bought the TCL 43 inch LED model with my wife's Amazon Prime account and it was delivered Dec 24.  So far it has been a great family Christmas present.  It doesn't have quite as many bells and whistles(like only one audio out connection) as some of the big name brands, but it has everything we were looking for.  The stand does not swivel but that has not been an issue as the picture is great from any angle in our living room.  This TCL has better built in sound than our 32 inch Philips LED TV .  I hooked up our Phillips CSS2123BF/7 sound bar and our Sony Blu Ray player BDP-S580 with no trouble.  I only refered to the quick start guide to put the base together, I have not needed the manual.  We watched the newest Batman movie in HD from Amazon videos and the picture was excellent.  We looked at some pictures on a thumb drive plugged in the TCL's USB port and had no trouble at all running a slide show.  My only question will be durability and how well the warranty works if we have a break down.

It was important to my wife that she have a TV in the bedroom.  It was important to me that I could do that, and still return the defective TV.

Shipping was super fast despite regular super saver!The sound is indeed weak, as was expected from other reviews, so you should buy a pair of small speakers or a soundbar, but you will still end up with a bargain and a nice screen (color is a bit different from an angle, though, ie less deep blacks etc, if that matters). The thin frame looks great! One thing I don't like is that the screen tends to take a while to switch between different resolution programs (ie HD and regular resolution) and it also always displays that info in some blue display in the corner, which is annoying. There should be a way to get rid of that small channel display (ie it says HTML 1 1080 x 720 dpi) as I don't really care for that info, I know I might be switching to a lower resolution channel you don't always have to tell me!

I get the screen today from Amazon with their quick 2 day shipping. I open the box, packaging is great, put the TV stand on, put the screws in easily into the 4 unthreaded posts, takes a little bit of work but I had it done in under 2 minutes, some of the reviews on here are greatly exaggerated on here about it being hard to attach the base. I hook up my cable box, pleasantly surprised with the quality of the picture which actually looked pretty good once on \"ECO\" mode and even better when I switched to the \"VIBRANT\" mode preset. This TV will work great for what I need because all it will be used for, is for watching with the cable box hooked up to HDMI 1.Here is the problem which is why I took this from a probably 5/5 star review for the value, down to a 1 star review. There is a bug with this TV that was also on many of their other models that they released a firmware update to fix but they have no firmware update for this model. The issue as TCL described it in their firmware update instructions for their 40 inch TV (L40FHDF11TA) is the following:\"Some owners may experience a condition, when using the HDMI connections on the TV, where the screen blanks out and loses sound for a few moments. This \ufb01rmware update will correct that problem. This entire procedure should take about 5 - 10 minutes.\"This is the exact issue I am having with the TV. When I hook up my laptop with HDMI out set to 1920x1080 and I turn on a video the screen starts to go completely blank after 30 seconds like it has lost the connection, audio over HDMI also drops out too so the problem is obvious when it happens. The screen blanks out for about a second and then it is back, only to have the same problem happen again, after another 30 seconds.This is not the purpose I am using the TV for as it works fine with my cable box, but other people could have the same problem, and it may even occur with other cable boxes, Blu-ray players, etc...I am going to leave this one star review until they release a firmware update to fix this issue, people need to see this and know they may have a potential problem if the TV doesn't play nicely with the input device. Some people may luck out and it may work fine depending on the device like my cable box, but other people are going to be disappointed.If you want to see the firmware instructions for the 40 inch you can go to this link:tcl-django.s3.amazonaws.com/medialibrary/2012/11/L40FHDF11TA_Firmware_Instructions.pdfI was thinking about flashing the 40\" firmware for the heck of it to see if it worked and if it didn't send the TV back since this is an issue anyway, but I don't think I'm going to risk it.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "WOW SUPER AAA+++++", "Author": "JR2673", "ReviewID": "R2WC1DY1T0BW7G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "JUST SO YOU KNOW THIS IS MY SECOND 43 IN TCL THIS TV IS MIND BLOWING..

BUT, that's OK! Fine Picture, Good Price otherwise.Seriously, in the pantheon of horrible TV audio, this unit is up there with the gods.*****But I Knew That When I Bought It!*****(Note: there are lots of other reviews that focus on the picture and probably describe it better than I. I will stick with other parts)In several reviews, this single fact (the bad audio) was the one noted repeatedly and yes, the speakers are as bad as everything written, but do not let that deter you from getting this TV. The solution is to grab a sound-bar (which you can get as cheap from $10-$75 or more) or set of computer speakers like the Cyber Acoustics Subwoofer Satellite System (CA-3602a) (about $40-$50) and you will have one rocking TV. I personally use a set of Bose Companion 2 Series II that I had from a previous TV and they work great. (The Bose speakers are not the best for TV audio, but it works for me.)The audio controls with the TV are fairly basic with a 5 band EQ and some other features like auto-sound level balancing, but it is pretty simple. The sound output is though a mini-headphone jack on the side. There is a on-screen control panel for Auto Volume Controll, SPDIF Type, Surround, balance  and internal speaker on/off. It is all very functional and easy to use. If you are some crazy audiophile, this may leave you wanting for more, but for the other 99.999% of the population across the inhabited world, it is fine.As noted in many other reviews here (and other places) the value in this TV is the fact the actual LED is SAMSUNG which makes a pretty big difference. That, along with the price were the reasons I bought the unit as I have other options for sound.If you really want to see some more detail, I suggest getting the PDF Manual for this unit. It is located at the following URL.............https://tcl-django.s3.amazonaws.com/medialibrary/2012/07/F3300_UM.pdfThe Quick Start Guide is located at this URL.........................https://tcl-django.s3.amazonaws.com/medialibrary/2012/07/F3300_QSG_6262012.pdfBoth files are free to download and view with Acrobat Reader or equivalent.As far as setup goes, it was easy. The pedestal base is a heavy glass that you should be careful attaching, but is not a big deal. Also the base measures 9\"x19\" so make sure you have the space. Also, there is no tilt on the base, so the entire unit has to be at the right level. The TV only sits about 2.5\"above the glass base.AS far as wall mounting, I did not go that route so I cannot comment.Regarding the picture: The actual image seems fine to me. I really appreciate the 1080p resolution when it is available. When it is not (depending on the channel) it is really obvious. Color balance, sharpness, backlighting and other features are pretty standard and nothing really jumps out other than this unit is a good functional product. If you are looking to win contests with this (whatever contest that might be), this TV may not be the best....in fact I am sure it is not the best. What is it then? A decent picture with a simple solution for better sound that will work well for a majority of people. If you are trying to keep up with the Joneses or even be the Joneses that others want to keep up with, you might want to keep shopping. If you want a decent TV at a reasonable price, this one fits the bill.Finally, one small shortcoming that is not a huge deal, but it is there. The IR remote receiver on the TV is located in the bottom left corner of the screen. The issues is that there is a likelihood that you might put something on the table the TV sits on and block that receiver. Not a huge thing, but it would have been preferable to have the receiver at the top of the unit.I give it a 4 because for the parts (picture, price, warranty, size) that mattered to me. If you factor in the sound quality, the unit does not really live up to a 4 (maybe a 3 or 3.5) as it is so bad. However, as I knew before-hand about the audio, it was an easy decision to purchase. If you want a TV where the sound will  come from the actual TV, you will be disappointed.", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "TCL LE43FHDF3300 43-inch 1080 LED HDTV", "Author": "Mollie Weaver", "ReviewID": "R1XXI666GMSVZI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The TCL 43\" TV is just right for me.

We could turn it off and on again and it would work just fine but we took to leaving it unplugged so that it didnt turn on and waste energy when we weren't around.The third month the mixed up columns of pixels started showing up when we turned the tv on ourselves, not just when the tv turned on by itself.  So we started having to spend 5 minutes or so turning the tv on and off until it booted up properly every time we wanted to watch something.  This continued to worsen.  I think one time we spend 15 minutes turning it on and off before it worked.We are in the fourth month now and last night the tv would not turn on at all.

I did not want to go through that again with this product so instead I did the smart thing and am returning it and buying a better known brand SAMSUNG 40 inch HDTV.  Should have gone with them in the first place but the price on this TCL was very attractive.

The Picture is SO bad, and the sound is worse. When we watch CNN news the anchor's head is chopped off (yes we know about adjusting the Aspect ratio). The remote control feels like a plastic toy, and only works if you're within 5' of the TV, so if you're in bed and you need to turn it up, well, you get up. The Direct TV won't program to it for some reason. Anyway, long story short, we made up our minds within a couple of days that you get what you pay for.

When comparing it to my other 3 monitors, it was clear that this monitor had to go back.  If you used this monitor without comparing it to a computer monitor directly, you might not see the difference.  Others have wrote that it is working fine for them, great deal then, but to my eye, I think it would contribute to a loss of vision.I also found the color of the MAC OS Lion background unable to display correctly, compared again to other monitors.  I tried calibrating the color in advanced mode on the MAC, and playing with the limited monitor adjustments.  The color never appeared correctly to me.I also sit fairly close to my monitors, one being an older 40' Samsung monitor, and found this 39 TCL to be blocky in text display.  Another quirk of this monitor, and it may be fine for some, is that it shuts off if the computer goes to sleep, again some might like this, but you have to wait for the startup cycle from scratch off all over again after turning it back on with the remote.I think, after looking at a Westinghouse LED monitor from a big blue and yellow store, the two are very similar, and to give some credit after looking at several other LED and LCD monitors running from a MacBook PRO thunderbolt display out, the two brands are better at text then many other new models I looked at, but not as good as some of my older monitors.  So it is better at text then some of the even higher end models I tried.
