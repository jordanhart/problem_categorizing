I was inclined to buy Samsung 6400 Series but NX711 won our heart. I am quite budget minded and couldn't spent a lot to get decent TV. 3D was never been top priority for me. Neither was 240 Mhz refresh rate. One thing I always wanted was Built-in WIfi in TV. Many Brand market their TV as \"Internet Ready\" or \"Internet Connectable\". To be honest, I thought its one and same thing but researching further, I came to conclusion it cost extra to make your TV connect (yes, you need to buy accessory to connect your TV to your internet).Specs: The TV got 120MHz , 3D transmission , LED, 46\" , Built-in WiFiSet up : Over all, it took 30 minutes for , not so geek , fellow like me to set up and Watch Cable and internet. I had to to call technical support, which was to my surprise promptly connected, for setting up TV Remote to control my cable box and DVD player.  I didn't have any issues updating software or firmware with the TV. Many of the apps were pre-loaded, including Netflix, You Tube , Hulu, Weather Widgets.Picture Quality: I still haven't tried watching 3D movies, but so far all the HD channel, makes you realize its beautiful world out there. I have very Bright Living room, but that doesn't affect the quality of Picture. Although, I do end up customizing sharpness sometimes.Audio: its decent but I think speaker will make things AMAZING.Drop Comment if you have questions.I will update this review after month or so.", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Shuts off by itself. Do Not Buy this TV!", "Author": "Satyaprakash Vedule \"satya vedule\"", "ReviewID": "R1MQJ44I6676NI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This TV powers down and powers back up by itself. This cycle goes on for atleast 15-20 times before it stops doing the same. I bought it at Costco and was asked to talk to Sony Folks for replacement. Sony gave me a couple of TV repair center contact  numbers and I was asked to seek their help. The repair center guys did what was the easiest.They replaced the power box and assured me the problem was resolved (without diagnosing the problem..:)..). The problem persisted and I called up Sony guys again. This time Sony agreed to replace the TV with a refurbished one and guess what? The new unit was plagued by the exact same issue, this time even worse. The TV would shut off and power on like 30 -40 times before you could start watching anything. I researched online and looks like this model - KDL46NX711, inherently has issues with it's circuitry and the way the soldering is done and many units that were dispatched have this issue. Embarrassing and frustrating. Not to mention, Sony does not cover installation costs and I have to Wall mount the new unit again.Just not expected from a brand like SONY. My recommendation to NEW buyers - Stay away from SONY TVs if possible. They are overpriced and if something goes wrong, their customer service is terrible. They will make NO exceptions if you have had issues with your device!! After all, they are TOO BIG to LISTEN to customers, RIGHT?", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Happy so far!", "Author": "corinabian", "ReviewID": "R2PDYUJS0NA5EL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Well I purchased this tv thru Sams club...it sat in the box for 2 weeks, while I tried to research it! I got it out of the box today, and I am so happy so far. I can't tell you I am a electronic expert by any means....This is my first LCD HD tv. I am replacing a 10 year old tube tv!! But I shopped alot and waited until i found a tv that had everything I wanted for a price I could afford. There is no reviews on this tv that I can find Via google! WE compared it to the on the local TV stores had. They had the same TV with 240hz(instead of the 120hz) One guy told us it is impossible to get a 3d picture with 120hz....well this Sony kdl46NX711 does! We have 90 days to play with the tv if I don't like it, it will go back. But so far.....LOVING IT. We have it in our living room. Our room does have a 7ft picture window in it, and the heavy drapes are open, just the see-thru curtain is covering it, and the light is not affecting the picture at all. Our package also included a ps3....we haven't played with that yet, but will be nice when we want to watch 3d blue-ray movies! I will update this review as I use the tv more...Oh wait, I was told by everyone that I would need a sound system....we have a 16x23ft living room and the TV is only 1/2 up and the sound is FINE...I am sure if we wanted cinema sound we would need a sound bar, but we are just happy to have a big tv with a wonderful picture....The sound will do for now. It is not Tinny like others have put on some reviews.The built-in Wifi was super simple to connect with our wireless network! As of right now the TV is on a table and we are not getting sound \"bounce off\" either.", "Date": "April 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "TV still working very good after one year", "Author": "Judy Yiu", "ReviewID": "RZMWQJ4ZONG6Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I always do research before I buy an expensive item.

The fact that its only 1.5-2\" thin is amazing.The built in streaming is awesome - i have sub-par Internet at the house but I'm amazed at the quality of Netflix blown up 46\" - the other built in Sony channels are great as well.I haven't played with the 3D functions that much but have so far up converted 2D to 3D and it works great. Looking to get a PS3 to play my blu ray and 3D content.One purchase I will not regret! :)", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "S. E. Mellema", "ReviewID": "RNGEL5WZNIUYB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV has a phenomenal picture and good sound. Tried a Vizio 1st-yuck-then a Samsung. It had a great picture and sound, but was very limited on the things I wanted to do(like have channel names). This Sony's simulated 3D leaves a lot to be desired, but maybe it's just my unit's problem. It has a TV Guide which is handy. It seems to loose the info, or not update after a time or two. If you have Broadband access all the time to update via the internet, this might work better. I've been trying to use the internal tuner, and when it fails, do internet. Guess I'll have to call Sony to see if there is a fix for this. Anyway, haven't had a 3D movie or broadcast yet, to try out the real 3D. Of the 3 TVs though, this is by far the best!", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004UV1M5C"}}
