I will start off with what I like about the TV and move on the few cons I have found.  I love the monolithic design of this TV... it really does look stunning on or off.  The internet streaming capabilities are very cool.  The included internet widegets/ channels make it easy to wirelessly stream various media (which has been fun) and it's also a breeze to connect to your Windows 7 machine to stream photos, videos, music etc... Like all HD sets you need to be connected via HDMI and have a true HD source to get the best picture quality... with that being said I have a PS3 for games and blu-ray, and a DirecTV HD DVR for cable.  The picture is very sharp, bright and crisp.  I would also say that standard def processing is above average as 4:3 content looks pretty smooth as well. I have handed off the up-scaling to a nice Anchor Bay chipset on my Denon receiver and didn't notice any improvement in picture quality.  So the on-board processing is definitely above average.  All-in-all this is a very nice set from Sony.  The only negative comments I have about this set, is that when the TV is on for a little while, I hear a slight popping noise... I believe its from the set heating up?  No big deal to me, but it has bugged me on a few occasions.  Other than that, the picture controls are somewhat limited which makes it hard to get the exact colors you may want to achieve.  Great set from Sony!  NX700 and NX800 series TV's are very sexy!", "Date": "October 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great for HD Broadcasts/Not so Good for other stuff", "Author": "madtsr \"madtsr\"", "ReviewID": "R3NXDNRUWS3HY9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall, a good deal for the price.  It is super thin (total width, not including the base is 2 inches).  Super-easy set-up for base mount (didn't do the wall mount).  The quality of pictures depends on whether you are watching something in HD or not.  Some channels listed as HD show SOME programs in HD, but not all.  No complaints about HD programs which come in great, with the usual caveat that the blacks have some slight color issues (black comes in black/purple black), which is pretty common with LCDs.  You really can't get away from this problem unless you go with a high end HD TV (thousands of $) or you buy a good plasma TV which have their own issues as well.  Overall, you won't notice this too much.  Blu-ray DVD movies come in great as well (with HDMI cable-see comments below).One of the nicer features is that it has an LED backlight behind the LCD screen, which you can adjust to make the picture brighter/darker.  Just playing with it, it looks best with the LED backlight turned up and the room lights dim.  As far as the sound, it is excellent-really good speakers.  I'm not too crazy about the menus, which are cumbersome because this TV has many different features (for example, settings for movies, gaming, sports).  I leave it on auto, which has been working fine.  It also includes the ability to access the internet for certain things, but you cannot surf around the internet like you do using a web browser.  The TV can do this, but you would need to purchase another box, like the Logitech/Google TV (it comes WiFi capable with a mini-keyboard for typing).  If all you want is what the TV offers out of the box (Netflix, Youtube, Slacker, facebook, twitter, Sony Music, & more), the WiFi is as easy to set up as a laptop, if you have a wireless network, which I do.  It searches for available wireless networks, you pick yours and enter your network password and you're done.  One problem - Does not work with Mac.  Some folks have suggested they have gotten it to work with some adaptors, but since I don't have a Mac I didn't bother reading much more about it.IMPORTANT - If you are going to order satellite or cable, make sure that you talk to your provider and ask specifically for a receiver that has an HDMI port.  The HDMI port is capable of faster/better data transfers than the ordinary three cable (yellow, red, white) plug in connections.  This makes a difference!  Some cable/satellite companies will give you the HDMI cables, and some won't.  If they don't provide them, you can buy an HDMI cable almost anywhere, but the receiver has to have the HDMI port.  I would suggest that you do not pay more than $5 for a 6 foot HDMI cable.  You will see advertisements for HDMI cables than run up to $50 (gold plated, turns a sandwich into a banquet, etc.).  You do NOT need anything more than the basic HDMI cable.  Any reputable techie website like CNET will say the same thing.Standard Definition programming is not so great.  Most of the time, they come out ok.  But for some of the older shows, often you get pixilation around the edges of text/images and the picture quality ranges from good to not so good (fuzzy).  Also, my wife has a huge collection of older movies (going way back to the 40's through the 60's), and she thought they would look really good on HDTV.  We have a Sony Blu-ray DVD player, also connected via HDMI cable, and some of the older DVDs look ok (e.g., The Honeymooners DVDs) and others were pretty sucky, so she is keeping her old TV to watch her old movies.  It's probably worse because this TV is a 46 inch, and the TV is essentially translating the standard definition information into a larger image in a different format.  If you're not looking back too far (only watching only the current age shows), this shouldn't be as big an issue for you.Finally - the remote is huge (10 inches by 2 inches long) and not all features are captured by the cable remote, so you can't just use the cable/satellite remote.  Not a good design at all.  Also, the printed instructions that come with the TV are minimal, and the i-Manual (which you access via the TV) is a pain in the xxx to use.  I prefer e-copies of user manuals, but I cannot seem to find one for this TV on Sony's website.  I sent them an email, and will update this review if I ever get an e-copy.12/9/10 Update:  I received an email back from Sony, saying that there is no pdf version of the i-manual for this TV.  Whoever thought of the i-manual obviously never tried to use the i-manual instructions with the TV.  It is a ROYAL PAIN!", "Date": "December 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very good TV", "Author": "INB", "ReviewID": "R3VVLAUMTIEWOR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Its been almost 2 months since we bought our 46 inch NX 700. Its a very good TV with amazing features and amazing picture quality. Internet connection is fast, File Sharing between PC and TV is amazingly fast. Picture and sound quality is above competition.Was thinking about whether to buy Samsung or Sony, no doubt Samsung also makes good TV but Sony makes it better. I would say Picture/sound quality is almost equal between two but Internet features are really good on Sony and it loads internet videos very fast. SO far no complains absolutely love it...This is my first review of any product, I found it strange that there is no review for product of this quality.

Here's some help, I hope.When you connect the TV there will be some introductory setup instructions. If you are going to wall mount it, there are no mounting screws included, so read the instructions and get metric screws/bolts of the proper size and length of 8-12 mm; if too long, they may screw into the TVs innards and damage something. Bye-bye $800.00 or more (the cost obviously depends on your shopping score).1. If you have a cable box, be sure and select cable2. Select automatic updates if you are going to use the internet. It didn't work for me (see below) but for you, who knows?3. Internet setup. Router password is case sensitive. An icon in the lower right switches between upper/lower case, numbers and symbols. after setup, internet features can supposedly be available. Not so fast. From the main menu, there are icons across the top. A film strip icon identifies internet content. This is where it gets sticky. I clicked on Netflix to register my device with my subscription and got a message that a TV software update was necessary, and to turn on automatic updates. I already had done that, so I turned the TV off and on again. No luck. Went to the computer and to Sony support, selected the model number of the TV (KDL40NX70) and migrated to \"firmware updates\". Presented with a lengthy menu first advising me to turn on automatic updates. blah, blah-done that.Lower on the screen instructions on how to document my firmware version and download updated firmware. Long story short, you must download a zip file, check it's length, unzip it, copy the unzipped folder to a thumb drive formatted in fat32 and plug it into your TV's USB port. The TV must be on! That worked. Took a while. Don't touch the TV or remote while updating on pain of death. The TVs, not yours-at least till it tells you it updated Ok. Migrate back to Netflix and an activation code will be displayed to enter on your computer at the Netflix site--my account, register new devices.4. Now that you can get internet service, time to set up the TV picture. First go to audio setup. Last upper icon on the top to the left and slide down two icons to the audio setup. Turn off the obnoxious noise every time you press the setup buttons. Now one up to picture setup. The picture as the TV came was horrible, dull and smeary. I'd suggest going right to \"custom\" and sliding down to \"advanced\" so you can select the warmness (I chose low), motion blur (off is better), white, black, and color screen intensities in light and dark areas of the picture. Skip the not too helpful basic setup. I wasted about 1/2 hour without success in getting the picture the way I liked it before I went to advanced. Connect your DVD/Blu-ray, adjust it's resolution to 1080P and it's aspect ratio for your movies, and that's about it. When you adjust the specific colors, the TV displays half of the picture on the right of the setup screen, so you can monitor changes.I probably skipped a few things, sorry. I noticed some of the reviews said the pic was too blue. That can be adjusted from the advanced menu.After the setup, good stuff.Good luck.", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good but not great...", "Author": "sg", "ReviewID": "R1NGGYQ7AFE7JY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "overall experience with the TV is pretty good. I like the thinner profile hanging on my wall and the updated interface is a big improvement. picture is a little washed out no matter how I try to tweak it. previously had a 3/4-year old 40\" XBR which had a little bit better picture...I gave it to my mother because I wanted a bigger screen. the glossy screen is nice but gets lots of glare from room lights at night. the remote is awful.  Sony spent no time designing this thing to fit in the hand and there's no \"pause\" button for DVR/DVD function. crazy. lastly, if you have a Mac you will not get the internet functionality. too bad because I would have loved to use the Netflix capability. don't know why Sony has never made their stuff Mac-friendly, except when they were forced to make iPod accessories.", "Date": "July 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "This is an excellent TV!", "Author": "Mark C. Asuzu", "ReviewID": "R3C9ZRH36C4JPK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this TV for a month now. I love everything about the TV. For five months, I searched for a replacement for my 12-year old Sony Triniton that still works like magic. I visited many electronics stores and compared the items physically. Here are what I like about the TV:-Monolithic design. There TV is covered with a glass [as in a plasma tv]. This reduces glare associated with other LED tvs. The glass looks tinted dark, just a little. I have kids and I know they cannot push their little fingers through the glass to destroy the liquid crystal.-The picture quality is superb. It is almost on a par with my neighbor's toshiba that he pays extra for HD transmission. I get an astonishing picture without HD.- The speakers sound clear. Many other brands sound like mosquito unless they are connected to a sound bar or home theater. With this TV, I do not have nor will I ever buy an external speaker.-Connection to the internet is perfect. No adapter is needed. The WI-FI is built in.-It is so satisfying just looking at it.- There are no motion blur.- The screen stays cool to touch.- It is a SONY! Good quality control.- It is very heavy for a flat screen TV because the glass adds about 30 pounds to the weight. So, get a sturdy TV stand if you buy one.- I bought is for in Newark, DE. The one reason i wrote my review here is because I shop and buy from amazon and I know that many people shop here, too. I noticed that the price has gone up by $300~$400 all over the stores. This model is no longer in production. People are realizing the quality and that pulls up the demand. With the supply fixed, prices can only go up. If you cannot find one, then buy the NX800. It is equally good and boasts a 240Hz refresh rate.Buy one now if you can find it. You will be glad you did.", "Date": "November 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "great HD; not so great SD", "Author": "H.
