{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Gorgeous TV", "Author": "Tyson", "ReviewID": "R3GCJ8HUK08YFQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This 4K TV is not currently within my budget, but I'm in awe of how gorgeous the picture quality is. I sat at the display center at Best Buy for a solid 45 minutes with my mouth dropped open in amazement. I think it's pretty safe to say that all the naysayers who thought 4K Resolution wouldn't be discernible by the human eye have been proven wrong. A great 1080p transfer still wows me, but this is a whole new experience.Obviously the major problem right now is that there is virtually no 4K content to enjoy, but that shouldn't be a problem for long. Amazon and Netflix have both announced that 4K streaming will be coming soon and Samsung is saying a new 4K Blu Ray disc will be out before 2015. Movies filmed in 35mm, which are almost all of them, will see vast PQ improvements with 4K so it's actually a very practical upgrade from 1080p. Definitely looking forward to this new technology!!!", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$5,496.00", "Features": null, "Name": "Sony XBR-65X900A 65 4K Ultra High Definition TV & 4K Ultra HD Media Player Bundle", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41c-d2UJrSL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00DRKQPTU"}}
