Wong", "ReviewID": "R22PZ7XHUJB3FN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Today I threw out the humongous carton that came with the Sony XBR65X900A.I bought this set exactly 30 days ago from Amazon.  It took a lot of effort to get it ready for view, the TV cabinet, the Sony technicians for the 4K Media Player, Time Warner Cable, and a physical wired ethernet connection for the Sony Media Server.  The hard work was worth it as the picture from this thing is better than anything I have seen at the best New York theaters; including screens at AMC Loews Lincoln Square 13, BAM Rose Cinema, Lincoln Plaza, Ziegfeld, Regal Battery Park and the fabulous Paris Theatre.  The sound at level 45 is at 98 decibels in my 21x14' room while playing Avatar in 3D.  Oh yes, the 3D with the Sony passive glasses are the absolute best 3D I have seen at any setting.  Less confusing than at an IMAX theater, the details are pristine and there are no confusing backgrounds to foregrounds even with Avatar.  Watch Harold and Kumar 3D Christmas and you have the best 3D demo up to 2013.Now about all the non 4K sources upconverted to the XBR65X900A, DVD and pre DVD stuff will look no worse than they did with any current top of line 1080p set, including the great plasmas from Panasonic and Samsung.  (I did sit for hours at the Best Buy Lincoln Center store where they had this set next the the 4K set from Samsung and the near $4,000 plasmas from Panasonic and Samsung.  I bought in blu-rays to compare....)With Time Warner Cable premium channels like HBO and Showtime, the upconversion is seamless and looks like film with the extra resolution and spark you just will not see at most theaters.  You will not be annoyed as in certain theaters where the screen has scratches, dark spots, curvy lines and or the brightness isn't uniform.  The Sony 4K is sharp and true to the edges.  The blacks like in The Dark Knight Rises appear so detailed you can see the stitching in Batman's costume.  No problems differentiating the different shades of blacks.  The whites maybe a tad less white than the top Panasonic plasma but I am picking hairs.I did not change the default Standard settings during my first 30 days.  I did try briefly the Vivid and other pre-set modes and did not like them.  The Standard seems true in most cases.My kid and his friend played a day of PS3 on the XBR65X900A with all thumbs up.  They played many action packed games and had no problems with delays or artifacts.Regarding the 4K server.  Sony's people here in New York were very careful with the handling of the set.  The TV needs to have the back panel removed in order to change a chip for the 4K Media Player to work.  This is also suppose to make it future compatible for HDMI 2.0, although that is not available now.  The 4K sources are like the Sony 4K demo videos (with the little girl running all over the place...), sharp and lifelike, almost 3D level.Using a web connection speed of 20mbs and higher, the 4K Media Player can pretty much download from Sony's 4K online service within minutes.  By the time you get a drink, the 4K movie is ready for view.I hope this helps.", "Date": "September 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Was a BELIEVER!!  But now throwing in the TOWEL!!!", "Author": "D. Diggs", "ReviewID": "R1PL7V2VYPFMHJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I rated this television 5 stars after making a few picture adjustments that seemed to literally POP the picture out - possessing a depth-of-field approaching 3D; however, I now must downplay that review.In addition to my 4K I own a Sony XBR-HX929 (a year old set), and found that making similar picture adjustments produced a near identical picture.This realization was disconcerting given the vaunted 4K technology in which I made a significant investment was reduced to me having to stand a few feet away to attempt to see something, anything, that was different (i.e., better than my year old set).  Knowledgeable of the return policy of the vendor from whom I purchased the 4K, I found myself thinking more and more of divesting myself of this...underwhelming yet significantly priced new innovation.In hopes that perhaps seeing native 4K from the media server (just made available) would sway me, I purchased one and enthusiastically hooked it up and awaited my appointment a week later to deal with the HDMI circuit board swap to allow the television to communicate with the server (I guess Sony forgot that communication with the server was necessary?).  The technician showed up and did his work (upgrading to HDMI 2.0).  Upon pressing the power button I was immediately rewarded with a 4K symbol fading in and out showing signs of life for about 30 seconds...before morphing into a black screen with an error code.The technician couldn't do anything about it and referred me to Sony phone support to rectify the problem.  I started that process the following night attempting various fix suggestions that didn't work and waited fifteen minutes after my case was escalated to the higher level before hanging up.  I called back later and that \"higher level\" support department was already closed.  Apparently they think so hard at that level they need more rest and leave at earlier hours.I tried again the next day telling Sony that I wouldn't wait for more than a few minutes and requested that they call me when I would be available in front of my television.  The rep said they could and made the notation in my file, but the call never came.  I called Crutchfield, the retailer, and requested a return.  As I type these words my 4K is back in its box and the 4K Media Server is in its (i.e., they'll both be soon headed back from whence they came).I'm a Sony fan, but this 4K roll-out was rather...ham-handed.  After paying $5500 for the television and server to have a combo that doesn't work together and requires technician and phone support (to no avail) is NOT a good use of my money and certainly doesn't engender near or longterm confidence in the health prospects of the equipment.I opted to divest myself of the 55\" 4K and invest in the 65\" XBRHX950 (Sony's last pre-4K XBR).  The picture quality, outside of 4 feet, will be indiscernible with that of the 4K, I gain 10 more inches and pocket $1500.  I'll take it!!!Plus, the picture difference really is not anything to hoot about.  Sony says it themselves that one must be within 4 feet of the screen to appreciate the difference.  If you plan on setting this set up in a bedroom and make a habit of sitting on the edge of the bed to enjoy the higher definition, this television is for you.  However, if you plan on setting it up in a larger room where you're likely to be more than 6 feet away, there really is no sense in buying 4K.Also, another thing that is and always was worrisome about this roll-out are the 10 movies Sony sought to be the flag-bearers of native 4K prowess:Bridge on the River Kwai, Bad Teacher, and The Other Guys to name a few.  I think if I were rolling out something revolutionary I would seek to kick down the front door with blockbusters people want to see, not sneak in through the back door to catch people looking the other way.If money is no object and you haven't purchased a television in 5 years...I still won't get this television, get a XBRHX950 or XBRHX929.  But if you have a 2 year or younger set, wait until there's a reason to upgrade.  This, unfortunately, is no reason to upgrade...not yet.Why did Sony go ALL IN on 4K that doesn't yield obvious benefits to the end user?  I can only imagine that Sony envisions economies of scale rendering the cost of building a 4K about the same as building a conventional 3D HD and the only televisions that will be available in the very near future will be 4K - so they want to be the first to throw their hat in the ring.Don't be a pioneer, it's expensive and time-consuming.  Wait for the price drop.", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "This Exceeded My Expectations", "Author": "J. Ward", "ReviewID": "R1GRKZGR80H3AM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I waited patiently for seven years to upgrade my (then-new) Sony KDL40-XBR3.  As then, I wanted to spend some dough and acquire a future-enabled TV that I can enjoy for years even as new content and technology becomes available.  My XBR3 is a native 1080p display and when I got it, nobody provided native 1080p content.  Now, it\u2019s everywhere and the XBR3 still does a fantastic job rendering 1080p.So I wanted a 3D TV that has all of the high-end video and audio processing capabilities I will ever want over the next 5-10 years.  This means no active goggles so I need passive 3D.  And it means something that can handle the HDMI 2.0 standard, which was finalized only last October.  And I don\u2019t want to add a separate surround sound system so I want at least the great pseudo-surround experience I always had with the old XBR3.  Finally, my viewing distance is limited to no more than eight or nine feed so I need something no larger than 50-55\u201d or so.  Oh, and I really wanted to do this for about the same cost as my XBR3 so forget the $9,000 OLED I saw recently.After surfacing every January to look around, I postponed for one year and then another.  Finally, when I looked again in January 2014, I found that LG, Sony and Toshiba had 4K passive 3D UHDTVs available.  But the Sony alone had top video and audio quality ratings.  Even the cheaper Sony XBR55X850A added to the line later in 2013 omitted the 65W speaker system included in the 900A, and the others didn\u2019t compete with the Sony video processing quality recited in the reviews I found.Every passive 3D UHDTV uses Film Pattern Retarder (FPR) technology to provide left and right 3D images simultaneously with no frame delay between L and R eyes.  This suppresses ghosting compared to active schemes with non-zero fame delays as I understand it.But I was concerned about rumors that the Sony XBR55X900A provides a 3D image that is limited to 540p resolution (allegedly not the case for the larger 65-inch display in the same Sony line).  With the new HDMI 2.0 support provided by recent Sony firmware upgrades, the video bandwidth should support 1080p 3D images (one L HD image and one R HD image packed into a single 4K frame) but rumor says that the FPR was too tightly squeezed in the smaller 55-inch display to permit reliable production of 4096-line retarder films (somebody heard it from somebody who knows a Sony engineer, etc).  I tried but could find no real evidence of this except for a You-Tube video purporting to demonstrate the deficiency with a test pattern \u2013 but this video predates the recent Sony firmware upgrade.  I was not persuaded but worried because I want HD 3D.Finally, seeing no other real contender, I ordered my new Sony XBR55X900A, relying on the Amazon Return Policy to bail me out if these rumors proved true.This new Sony has exceeded my most optimistic expectations.First thing I did was install the new firmware (upgraded to PKG4.201AAA) released on 07Feb14.  Sony Tech Support website says that the PKG4.001AAA released on 23Dec13 supports the October 2013 HDMI 2.0 spec and supports 3840 x 2160p at 59.94/60Hz YCbCr 4:2:0 8bit and 4096 x 2160p at 59.94/60Hz YCbCr 4:2:0 8bit, which should handle data rates necessary for 1,920 x 1080p passive 3D images at 60 fps (but I know of no available content).  The original Sony specs (before the firmware upgrade) limit 3840 x 2160 to 30fps and limit 4096 x 2160 to 24fps.Next, I ran a few basic tests using the Spears & Munsil Test DVD (with 3D) in my Oppo 103 Blu-Ray Player, which has native 4K output capability and certainly can handle 4K frame-packed 3D images.  I could not detect any frame delay between L and R images using the test pattern.  I did not make the effort needed to test for ghosting with a light meter but was unable to see any ghosting even out to the sides or standing up near and above the screen.  Some Reviews had reported more of a vertical ghosting tendency than lateral but I saw none at any of the positions we reasonably use.  This amazed me.  Even if there is ghosting, if I can\u2019t find it, I\u2019m good.Regarding the rumored 540P 3D limitations: I can see individual hairs and other HD-type features (razor sharp edges, etc) in the 3D images provided on my new Sony.  Looks like 1080p to me \u2013 I don\u2019t care what the early test results may have shown (before the December 2013 firmware upgrade).  I admit that the 3D image (up very close) appears to have double-wide scan lines (one L and one R most likely but I did not test that assumption) and I\u2019m no expert but dual lines in a 4K display is what I expected in a 1080p image anyway.  No matter \u2013 my Sony provides the best color and other image processing qualities available today for 2D images (don\u2019t rely on my opinion alone \u2013 check out the Consumer Reports review of October 2013).  And the sound, like my old XBR3, is awesome.This Sony can also display Native DCI (Digital Cinema Initiatives) 4K (4096 x 2160) but a 60fps refresh rate requires the December 2013 firmware upgrade.  I\u2019m unaware of any available content.I know of no significant available native 4K content (beyond demo disks) but my Oppo 103 will up-convert anything to 4K, as does the Sony itself.  One review suggested that the Sony up-conversion quality is at least as good as the Oppo.  I couldn\u2019t say and I don\u2019t care \u2013 the 4K content will come in its time and I am ready for it now.  In five years, we all will be buying passive 3D HD displays, I expect.  I am ready for that with this Sony XBR55X900A.I suggest a careful review of the Consumer Reports review published in late October 2013 and made available as \u201cSony XBR-55X900A: Consumer Reports Shares a Review with AVS\u201c on the web.  However, be aware that the review predates both the finalization of the new HDMI 2.0 specification and the announcement by Sony of the new firmware PKG4.001AAA that supports this new standard.Finally, one disappointment.  My old XBR3 has a wonderful matte screen that eliminates reflections beautifully.  I miss that with the new Sony XBR55X900A, which could stand in as a boudoir mirror.  I suspect that the light polarization provided by the film pattern retarder technology would be scrambled by a matte overlay (but I have not researched it) so this to me is likely a trade-off for a great passive 3D experience.  Also, the passive 3D image is reduced in intensity by the polarized viewing lenses, which limits utility of this Sony in bright rooms.", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "oh yes.. it's INCREDIBLE!!", "Author": "eDER80", "ReviewID": "RAS8FJFBOZ7OU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE-4/19/2014I recently upgraded this tv to the 65\" X900A and i have to say, I'm so happy I did! It's a gorgeous tv with an incredible quality. The 3D is just breath taking!Bigger is always better with 4k! :) worth the upgrade!(original review for the 55\"X900A)I finaly decided to pull the trigger on this tv,upgrading from the samsung es8000. The samsung is still one of the best tvs i've ever owned, but this Sony is beyond impressive. It's incredible! I wasn't sure if i would be able to see a difference in performance based on the fact that samsung has one of the best picture qualities out there, but i was wrong. The fact that 1080p can look this good upscaled is exciting in its self! First of all, this tv is very expensive but does it deliver the goods? Yes it does IMO. After bringing it home, the first thing i noticed was how heavy this set is. Twice the weight of my 55es8000. The set up was simple and fast.It comes with two controllers. I had no problems setting this baby up myself.I love the circular chrome stand and the speakers. Not sure why many are whining about,I'm actualy a fan of the sexy/sleek design. It's different from the other XBRs from previous years and i like that. I hooked it up to my sony 3D bluray 1000 watt surround sound system,BDV-N790W and WOW! what a beautiful Picture! There are tons of picture and sound settings that i'm still playing with and getting used to since this my very first XBR Bravia, and boy what a way to make the switch! lol All i can say is that this tv delivers!! Bright, beautiful true to life color and detail that surpasses anything i've seen up to this day. I have not tryed the 3D since i've been checking out some of my 2D blurays to see the benifit of the built in upconverter. The sound is also very good on this tv, though i wont be using it much since i already own a system. I must say, the 3D glasses look good and feel light since they are passive. I will post a few pictures. Over all i'm extremly happy with my purchase and cannot wait untill true 4k content starts to hit the market! Already the picture quality in this set is amazing, that includes my regular Dish programing. Watching sports in this tv takes it to a whole different level! One complaint i do have is that the screen reflects light a bit more than my old samsung. Not a deal breaker, but still a bit annoying at times.I know that turning up the backlight helps a bit, but i dont like to do that because it makes my picture seem like its on torch mode. Sometimes i forget this is only an edgelit led thanks to the local dimming. The picture pops with excellent contrast. I have it set to standard right now, and my back light set to 7. Again, the settings on this tv are nothing like the ES, so i try to keep that in mind. For those people saying that you have to sit realy close to the tv to see a diference, I'm here to tell you that isnt the case. When you do get close to the tv however, you realize the picture is still clear as if you were at the regular viewing area. there is little to NONE of the picture noise you tend to see in other 1080p tvs because of the 4x  amount of pixels. The picture is smooth and lifelike thanks to the increased resolution. Over all, if you want some of the best detail and picture quality on an LED tv, look no further, but be prepare to invest! lol thanks for reading and feedback is welcomed. Will update on the 3D performance soon!Update 6/10/13After finishing the Avengers 3D, i have to say this tv delivers an AMAZING 3D experience unlike anything ive seen before. I've seen the passive 3D on high end LG's and Vizios, and they dont even come close. The best way i can describe it is a mixture of the beauty and sharpness of active 3D combined with the comfort,brightness and eyepoping style of passive 3D! :) it truely is the best of both. I cant wait untill true 4K 3D is available. that in itself would be nothing short of expectacular! Thanks for reading.edit- one thing i must add to this review, is how well this tv handles internet streamed video content. it is simply AMAZING! Sony throws in a year of free Netflix,Hulu plus, and music unlimited. the quality is breath taking! the richness in scale of color, detail and smooth motion is just beautiful to watch. :)update 6/23/13sony sent a second software update which seems to have made the picture even better. Still in love with this TV and i'm still blown away by how clear regular 2D bluray and streamed video is handled. watching \"The Hobbit, the desolation of smaug\" teaser trailer on youtube is just mindblowing! The quality is beyond impressive! to those of you who own this tv and have seen it know what i mean. One thing i forgot to mention in my review is that this Sony also has a setting called \"mastered in 4k\" which is enabled when you choose \"cinema1\" PQ under settings. This not only upscales remastered in 4k blurays, but also any of your favorite 2D blurays from your collection. The result is a more lifelike,true to life color that is just unbelievable.update 7-14-13with the purchase of the 4k media player, Sony is sending a technician free of charge, to replace the HDMI port 4 from 1.4 to 2.0 and upgrade for compatability. Had to include this in my review as I have noticed some are concerned about making the investment in buying this awesome television because of that.When I bought it, I was told by Sony that this tv would be upgraded and current owners wouldn't be left out. Thank you Sony for coming through on that promise.update 8-28-13I now own both the tv and the 4k media player, which is only compatible with this model. My hdmi port 4 was replaced to 2.0 during activation along with a software update. I comfirmed this with Sony today. I must say i continue to be wow-ed by the beautiful picture quality and amazing detail only this sony delivers, specialy when you see true 4k being displayed on screen. It realy is a beautiful sight!update 9-5-2013I just read on the sony website that all of these 4k sets will be upgraded to hdmi 2.0 standard for all additional ports by the end of 2013. it will be done through a firmware update! Here is the direct quote from Sony,13).\"An Internet firmware update to support HDMI\u00ae 2.0 to accommodate 4K/60p (59.94/60Hz) video content will be available end of 2013. Requires that the TV is connected to the internet to receive the update.\"So as you can see, this updagrade will be given for ALL Bravia 4k owners.update 01/27/2014Sony indeed updated this model and the X850A 4k model to hdmi 2.0 with a firmware update back on Dec 19th 2013. I'm using the \"cinema1\" option for my picture settings which enables the \"mastered in 4k\" feature for every input. This upscales even regular programing to near 4k quality. I have to say that i'm still blown away with the crisp, clean sharp images, 3D performance, and over all picture quality on this set. inky blacks, great contrast and rich colors make the image pop. With prices going down and more 4k content on the way, including Netflix 4k later this year, This tv is still a great choice.", "Date": "June 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wow'sa", "Author": "Forrest S.

The colors are amazing add to that the detail and you feel like it's not a picture but the real thing. We got the set on May 16th, maybe one of the first around here(NH), the 5K is hard to swallow at first but in truth we've paid more for Flat Panels when they first came out with no where near the Picture Quality, someone has to start the ball rolling, lol.It's important to note that this TV is NOT Samsung Thin, matter fact almost harkens back to them older Plasma's we had, maybe not as thick but don't think your buying into a hanging art piece that hugs the wall. We got the Slim tilt one touch from Sanus it's a nice wall mount for this TV and to adjust it you just gently push or pull on the TV. For those who want slim you could do a in wall setup.Setup of the TV is simple and instructive, but be fore warned you need to do a SYSTEM UPDATE otherwise you may find the TV turning on/off, the remotes not working etc. We spent a hour with Sony Tech Support after hours trying to reset the TV so we could go back through the setup and download the update, after awhile we finally go the TV to reset and update, THANKS to Sony for having Tech Support available on a weekday night after 9PM and low and behold a English Speaking rep, wow, Kudos to Sony.As for another Kudos for Sony how about them fancy side mounted Speakers and the amazing thing they sound pretty decent, no need for a sound bar for this TV, if you want casual TV time no Surround Sound this TV has more than acceptable Sound to watch general TV without running the AV Gear.All in the All, yes it's expensive, but the newest and greatest tech always is, and being the Tech Nerd I am, the latest and greatest always gets my attention, Sony will Sell a lot of these TV's and were not in the least unhappy we bought it.Pro's;  WOW what a picture, Amazing Colors and Detail no matter what you watch, Nice Sound built-in another WOW, easy setup and got to say what a pretty TV.Con's;  Expensive, No Warning about doing the Update so make sure you do it, not so Skinny like a Samsung.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "3D on the 55\" doesn't really work, but otherwise a remarkable product that everybody who has seen it at my home goes on about.", "Author": "jjnbos", "ReviewID": "R2YARWK737T7T9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is an awesome TV. I have the 55\" which is bigger than any TV I've ever owned but it has a design defect: 3D only uses 540 lines. That is correct, this \"4K\" TV only uses a quarter of the lines available when displaying 3D. Maybe I'd watch more 3D if it didn't have this defect, or maybe I wouldn't, but it's obvious to see that this is the case: get reasonably close to the TV with the googles on and you'll see horizontal black lines cross half the screen!The 65\" does use all the lines. So if 3D is important to you, get the 65\".--Otherwise it's an awesome picture and the sound is excellent. I mean so excellent that we moved the stereo to the man cave and use this TV and a small 8\" subwoofer as the living room stereo. Sounds unlikely but it's true. I used to fill up the living room with huge speakers, power amps, preamps, processors, and all that. The sound on this TV is so good most people like it better than the big stereo. Obviously you'll need to use the TV's own  equalizer to roll off the internal sub to get these results, but it's amazing and easy to do.Speaking of equalizer, you'll want to calibrate the picture too. Long story short at the Best Buy they'll have it set to \"Vivid\" which is completely inaccurate, but the default settings in \"Cinema\" are within a single click of calibrated. Which is what you'd expect for a TV this expensive, I guess. You need to do that so that the blacks are black. The AVS forum I discuss in the comments has a zillion entries about how to do that; backlight 7, dynamic LED standard...Bottom line: it's the best \"consumer TV\" out there, but probably the most expensive too. As the price drops to the $3,000 level I expect this thing to take over the market for high end mass market stuff. Sure you can buy a $10,000 plasma with better blacks, but if you don't sit in a room with black out curtains and so on, this is TV you'd want.

Mcdermott", "ReviewID": "R2SMYOV19BNT4N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This new XBR-55X900A display is the best I have seen and the upscaling quality is noticeable.  Despite numerous posts about lack of 4K source material, the screen picture is much brighter/vibrant and sharper with better color, yet smooth pixel-less for regular network broadcasts. Blu-ray disk movies are improved with sharpness, better color, and a picture that \"grabs you\", so I do not agree with some posts that the picture is the same as the 1080p TVs. The up scaling is noticeable.Also YouTube is now offering 4K videos so you can see what new source material will look like. Not sure what the new Blu-ray disks with 4K mastering will do for this new 4K TV. Sony provides via mail 3 of these \"Mastered in 4K\" Blue-Ray disks when buying the new 4K TVs (See www.sony.com/RegisterMy4K)  The biggest improvement for me was the exceptional sound quality and passive 3D. The difference between my 2 year old NX810 and this X900A is remarkable My sound is better (from installed front mounted speakers) than I was getting using a Boston Acoustics sound bar (w/subwoofer) with my old TV. The sound is very close to my Bose surround sound system. Very happy with the new speakers. And yes my 55inch takes up by 60\" entertainment center space or I would have purchased the 65\" TV. But I am happy with the new speakers and the fact they are attached makes for a good looking TV. My wife is very happy as the new TV looks great with her furniture instead of a sound bar popping out of a wall or corner. These new speakers produce an exceptional sound better than any Sony TV I have ever had including those that had front mounted speakers. There are 6 speakers with a total 65watts The 3D (passive vice previous version was active 3D using shutter glasses) is exceptional, as good as a movie theater with great 3D depth and a brighter picture (my 2 complaints with the NX810). Much better depth and much sharper than my previous Sony TV (NX810). Also the simulated 3D is also good. And the passive 3D is easy on your eyes. Just watched Avatar 3D and my eyes are not tired as they would be with an active 3D. 3D is now worth watching and the glasses are light on your ears as they are only a thin plastic (no batteries)(same glasses used in the local theater) Price is steep but happy with the purchase Also the new Sony BDP-S790 blue-ray player upscales Blue-Ray to 4K and passes it to the X900 via the new hi speed HDMI cables that are available for under $10. My X900 display data reports a 4K signal received when using a normal Blu-ray disk so I am hoping the new Mastered in 4K disks will make a difference (vote still out). But YouTube also has many 4K videos available that you can stream via the YouTube app. This app makes it easy to shift the YouTube video from your iPad to the X900 display and the video appears to be 4K-certainly much better than any of the YouTube HD videos.", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic TV", "Author": "Gary W.

Before purchasing this Sony, my latest was a 73\" Mitsubishi that we found very satisfying. But, technology moves on. As we found our lifestyle including more video streaming and renting movies to view at home, I began looking to upgrade our viewing experience. 4K immediately grabbed my attention as a tv I should research and consider. I now spend considerable time researching products before making a purchase, including Amazon reviews, You tube research, and visiting local retailers to see things in person. A friend who bought a Nikon digital camera system described it as the \"hold, touch & feel test\". Having tried the approach myself, it is now a mandatory part of my research.Finding 4K tvs locally was a bit difficult. After visiting several of the regional tv outlets in our area, I was impressed with models from Samsung and Sharp, but couldn't find Sony models. Finally, my local Best Buy displayed a Sony 65\" 4 K system that included the Sony media hub.After watching & having the various units demo, I concluded the Sony provided the best visual experience. Audio quality was not important to me, because like me, you probably already have a quality surround sound system. I settled on purchasing the Sony 65\" 4K tv with media hub. The next step in my procedure is to research price because there are so many options since the advent of the internet. I compared the price from my local Best Buy with on-line retailers and soon came to the conclusion that although I could save maybe $500 by buying from a discount retailer from New York, who wants the hassle of delivery, set up and repair with a company 3000 miles away. Because my experience with Best Buy has always been terrific, I purchased this Sony set with Sony media hub, delivery & set up included. The delivery, set up and subsequent service provided by the Geek Squad was nothing short of magnificent. I'm glad now that I purchased the Sony from them, although I was tempted to buy directly from Sony after talking with their tech person.The Sony 65\" 4K tv is absolutely fantastic. It is be far the highest quality visual home entertainment system I have ever owned. Another factor that influenced my choice of the Sony tv is the commitment to provide 4K programming. And who is better suited to provide 4K movies than Sony itself?This tv fills our living room with a commanding presence. The picture quality is unquestionably superior to any other tv we have owned. The pairing with the Sony media hub provides you with an easy method of renting or purchasing 4 K movies. Using the Sony Entertainment Network is as easy as using Netflix. I have noticed the picture quality is superior with every video source we have, including DirecTV, Apple TV, the latest Sony 4K 3D blu-Ray player, & built-in apps.The picture quality and interface of the Netflix app provides a better picture than that provided by my Apple TV, which had been my favorite way of accessing Netflix.And this Sony set comes with an 18-month factory warranty, which I consider vital when purchasing a tv of this caliber, not to mention price. Yes, it's not cheap, but considering the fact I'm more comfortable watching movies in my home than anywhere else, I consider the price for my new Sony 4K tv to be reasonable.If you are ready to consider joining the 4K revolution, I strongly urge you to consider Sony units like this. You may conclude as I did that Sony provides an outstanding choice in home entertainment.", "Date": "April 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wow!", "Author": "UbiMea", "ReviewID": "R7AK67FRYASPC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Sony 55XBR900A is a beautiful TV.  Ordered on a Friday, it arrived via CEVA \"white glove\" delivery the following Thursday morning.  Amazon concierge services were helpful and available prior to delivery.  The delivery guys unboxed the TV, assembled the stand, placed the TV where we wanted it, and allowed me to hook up the TIVO, PS3 and Cat5 cable connections before powering up the unit; they then helpfully performed the initial setup before getting to a factory set out of the box spectacular picture. Pros: Picture and sound are nearly perfect; the beauty of the built in side mounted speakers is that you don't need a separate sound bar, although a high quality 5 or 7 channel surround system trumps the small surface mounted speakers.

This was my first major purchase of a television, most of my TV purchases were $2k or under. The most astounding thing about this TV was the picture quality. Regardless of signal this thing is a stunner. 1080i content or 1080p Blu-ray all look superb, the colors on this bad boy will awe. The upscaling feature is awesome and does make the image coming through just a little bit sweeter (480p still looks like 480p). The TV only has 120hz which I found not to be an issue, I don't notice any blurring or image quality issue because of it.3D is astounding. It comes with 4 pairs of passive 3D glasses and the TV handles passive with 1080p resolution per eye; which is something that most passive 3D 2k TV's could not do. I have tested it with Avatar and The Hobbit and many others. I found the 3D darn near flawless, little to no ghosting. The picture is bright and colorful due to the passive glasses. One movie I had the most issue with on other 3D TV's that I have owned was My Bloody Valentine 3D which was a mess with double imagining throughout. The only one's not having that issue seemed to be DLP TV's, well this one plays this one flawlessly. I did have some double imaging on some 3D films but they were conversions, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter was a minor convenience but Meet The Robinsons 3D was practically unwatchable. I did not fiddle around with settings but most of all other 3D Blu's I have watched have had no issues.The inputs are plentiful but there is one issue that must be talked about and that is the HDMI inputs. The four that are on here are only HMDI 1.4 and not the 2.0 spec that is coming later this year. 2.0 will offer 4k at 60hz and allow other specs that will be used for future 4k content. Sony has stated that purchasers of these 4K TV's will not be left out and that they will offer a solution. No details as to what or when or if it will be at a cost to us buyers or free. So beware if you decide to buy this TV. You can still enjoy 4K content like movies but 2.0 will be needed if you want to enjoy 4K gaming in the future, currently it would be capped at 30fps.The sound is excellent if you use the TV\"s sound versus a dedicated sound system. The speakers are not detachable and definitely make this TV wider than it would be for a normal 55 or 65\" TV. I use a sound system so I cannot say much more than that. The TV is also thicker than most LED LCD TV's so if you are looking for sleek and slim you might be a little disappointed. It's not DLP or CRT big just a little bit fatter than most are use to.The lack of content also must be brought up. 4K content is available on Youtube there is some debate on whether the 4K clips on the TV are true 4K or 1080p upconverted. I must say that if it is upconverted it looks damn good. If you want to experience true 4K you would need a desktop or laptop with a high end graphics card that can handle 4K and has an HDMI output that you can hook up to your tv. Sony has given owner's of the 84\" model a loaner 4K media box for free with the intent of giving them the upcoming Sony 4K Media player. We 55 or 65\" owners will have to fork over the $700 or $500 with coupon for this device which currently has no release date but rumors are for a July release date. The device will come with 10 free 4K movies with more to buy and 4K video clips possibly even a subscription service. There are Mastered in 4K blu-ray's available, they are not true 4K blu-rays but rather 1080p blu-ray taken from a 4K source. It's has extra information for our TV\"s that will make the image look a bit better than the regular blu-ray version. For a limited time you can can get 3 mastered in 4K movies free (Ghostbusters, Angels & Demons and Spiderman) just submit a form online.The TV makes HD look quite a bit better with it's upscaling and the Triluminos display technology really adds to the TV's image quality. So 4K content is lacking and we won't see much in the next year or two, but if you just want a TV with stunning picture quality than you cannot go wrong. This TV is pricey but that's the price we pay for having the latest technology. If you can wait a few years I would do so to see what improvements TV manufacturers come up with. But If you want one of the best picture quality possible (IMO) in a current TV and you can afford it, I say go for it. I do have some minor clouding and that seems to be about it. No TV is perfect but it's barely noticeable and when not seeing a pitch dark image the PQ is stunning.Native 4K looks stunning and is something that will make you excited to see what the future holds for 4K content. If you game you can buy specialty glasses that will allow split screen gaming to be seen by each person as full screen. Those are available for $20 a pair. I game with out a problem, no it will not make your Wii or Xbox 360 games look good like it would for a 1080p Blu-ray but it's a blast to play on a bigger (for me) TV. The two remotes are unnecessary and the both are not back-lit. It's got built in wifi so you'll have plenty of access to apps such as Netflix, Hulu and Youtube. There are other's but those are the 3 most I reckon use. I gave this TV a 4 out of 5 due to price as well as the lack of HDMI 2.0. If a solution does indeed arrive than the score would be bumped up to 4.5.Edit 9/4/13: Looks like Sony will release a firmware update later this year that will bring the spec to HDMI 2.0. No new HDMI cable needed just spec 2.0.

Until more content comes out one of the biggest benefits to 4K TVs is the ability to watch 3D in full 1080p Resolution. According to Sony's website both the 55\" and the 65\" version like all other 4K TVs on the market have this ability. Well that's a complete lie.When I initially purchased this TV I was amazed at the color and picture quality, I even enjoyed the sound coming from the side speakers so much that I didn't need to setup my sound system. However when I popped in a 3D Movie I was disappointed to see visible vertical lines. I assumed this was probably a limitation to my blu-ray player. However, watching the same movie on the same player at my buddy's place who owns the 65\" version he bought AFTER seeing my 55\" version shows how wrong I was. Passive 3D on his TV compared to mine made it seem like I owned a cheaper older 1080 TV and in a way I was right...After doing some more research I realized that the 55\" version of the 900a does not come with 3D at 1080p and has the same limitations as old 1080 panels. This is due to the size of the panel preventing them from fitting the appropriate FPR technology in/on to the smaller panel. Thus making the actual vertical resolution of this TV in 3D 1920x540p the very same issue older 1920x1080p TVs had in 3D. Afterwards I called Sony Technical Support, the first representative told me this was impossible and that the TV should come with 2K (1920x1080p) Resolution just like the other models as advertised, but after transferring me to a level 2 support rep my fears were confirmed. This TV only shows 3D at 1920x540p resolution. No firmware or changes to the panel could fix this. Afterwards I spoke with a supervisor who showed no sympathy to my problem and said there was nothing they would do to resolve the issue. I paid $3,500 (A $2,000 Premium) for the television itself, $700 on mounting the TV to my wall, and hours of labor all for a feature I was promised and lied about to.The worst part is that before buying this TV, I made sure to check Sony's website so I could be 100% sure this TV had 3D with 2K Resolution, going as far as using the website's comparison feature with all 3 sizes of this model and reading down the list to check for any differences. Not only does it make no mention of this feature being left out in their website description but actually states that the XBR-55X900A comes with 3D in 2K...3D Features3D Format Support : Yes(2K-only)Simulated 3D : Yes3D Super-resolution : YesAuto 3D Depth Adjustment : Yes3D : PassiveThat description is the same for both the 55\", 65\", and 84\" versions. This is false advertising and had I known this I would have never went with the XBR-55X900A since to my knowledge this is the only 4K 3D TV that still shows 3D at 540p.

Amazon had fast shipping and their TV concierge service worked with the freight company on the phone to get me a quick delivery.  Unpacked, checked that it turned on, put it in place on a stand and had some fun.Initial impression was that this set is nothing short of spectacular.  4k content (youtube) is breathtaking and upscaled content (DirecTV, Bluray, 360) is so clean and sharp it looks like you are on the movie set when you watch a movie - it's almost surreal.  Never been impressed by 3d until I watched a few 3d blurays on this set (Transformers Dark of the Moon 3d has some scenes that will flutter your stomach, like you are on a roller coaster).  Colors are vibrant, grayscale was good out of the box and both black and white are pure yet detailed as they devolve into shadows and off-white.  The cabinet is sleek and attractive and the 65 inch was definitely the right size to show off.  Only complaint with the design is they should have made the speakers on the side of the panel detatchable - If you are going to spend 7k on a 4k set, you are likely pairing it with one heck of a HT system.  People who say they don't see a difference between this set and 1080p sets (whatever the viewing distance) are off their rockers, or simply haven't bought and taken one of these home.However, I only had this set working for 48 hours.

Would change nothing except maybe some kind of button for customer who knows zero... for grandma to restore EVERYTHING... all inputs to \"back up settings.\" The button would be \"RESTORE.\" I like the TV sound so very much that I seldom want my elaborate 7.1 set up. The player works so easily that it seems like the ultimate recorded material interface. I wish that IT could control my blu-ray player. It's expensive stuff. I don't see myself updating this for many years, if at all (old guy talking). It is so much more than I expected. And... this is a big one.

I had my eye on the 65X900A because I wanted a larger screen without any loss of image quality. I'm not interested in 3D and 4k seemed like a big plus for years ahead. I have the Sony media player attached along with my blu-ray, Direct TV, cable, and sound system. Yes, I want excellent sound without my audio system because I don't like too much... fancy surround sound for talking heads and other programs. I'd say I only use sound system 40% of time. Big news is 1080p looks best ever, 1080i also great. Standard def, which I seldom use, is quite good... when I must. I love the design. The thing looks good... kind of like polished stone... well ...black glass. It's not imposing. Control is great. I love baseball... best ever image. I have checked out hockey recordings... fantastic. I love opera and my blu-rays look better than anything. The 4k player is a look at what will undoubtedly become normal. Right it was just a few years ago when experts said we'd never have 1080p by satellite or cable. 4k is spectacular. I can't wait until opera gets the treatment. No more buying blu-ray for me. I'll wait for 4k. Oh, I'll get a few... because they are so fine on this TV. I have read reactions of others. We are tough customers... we who buy early. I have experienced many great products that came early and were over-produced... built with over the top quality. Sony products have never disappointed me. Customer support by phone and online that is offshore is usually painful. They have great sales people on-shore... who know the product. I paid extra for install even though I did not expect a lot more than moving old TV and placing new one in position. The Sony contracted technician was very excellent. He saved me a lot of time and energy. We needed not a single call to anyone to achieve full function of the TV and the player. The 3D is startlingly effective, but less impressive than 4k. I love the equipment and it seems more valuable than the cost. Did I mention that the audio from the TV is excellent. Best ever for me, though my surround system is more perfect for classical music.

I highly recommend this TV you will be very pleased.", "Date": "July 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "When 65\" isn't enough", "Author": "Busy Executive", "ReviewID": "R1BWT0565NDGX6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "To me, the big promise of 4K TV will be large screen sizes that don't have the fuzziness of a 1080p signal gone too far. For instance, I have a top quality 1080p projector with all sorts of fancy video processing capability, but even with the best 1080p Bluray sources, the image gets unacceptably soft when projected on my 120\" screen. In contrast, a 65\" plasma screen looks great in 1080p, but to me, this has been about the limit. 1080p to 4K, having four times the resolution, should look as good as 1080p on a screen twice as large, so I have high hopes that I will indeed be able to fill my 120\" screen with a stunningly sharp picture in the not too distant future.As for the Sony XBR, I suppose I have mixed emotions. First, the picture is certainly quite good, even at 84\" and with 1080p content. Side by side to my favorite 65\" plasma, I'd say the Sony manages to give about as sharp and contrasty a picture with the same source material, even though the screen is substantially bigger - this is quite a feat. The image has Sony's usual crispness and brightness, and if this is the look you like, you won't be disappointed.This TV has all the state of the art standards, beyond 4K: HDMI 2.0, latest 3D technology, Internet connectivity, etc etc etc. If you're a tech-junkie, it's all in here.Still, as everyone points out, there's very, very little content available in 4K, and if you think you can send a conventional DVD image to a screen this large, you may want to audition it in person before spending your money.Also, keep in mind that you really do need a large TV to see the difference between 1080p and 4K...on two TVs of equal quality, size, viewing distance, etc, the human eye can't distinguish between 1080p and 4K resolution until the screen is big enough to make it obvious. Personally, if I were looking for less than 60\", I don't think I'd opt for 4K anytime soon. On the other hand, 4K opens up a whole new dimension, such as the 84\" Sony, or giant projection screens - if I'm going large, it's definitely going to be 4K.One other point about 4K content is that it may be more of a challenge than most people think before widespread adoption takes hold. Although content producers talk about resolution (4K or 1080p), the other issue you have is bitrate, or the degree of compression applied to the video signal. You can find camcorders, for example, that do 1080p at 10mbps, and professional grade equipment that do over 60mpbs. Both are technically 1080p, but the lower bitrate is never going to look as good on a big monitor. A video remastered at 4K but the same bitrate as 1080p likely won't look any different.Problem is, high bitrates create lots of cost. If 4K is four times the resolution, a movie that barely fits on a Bluray disc will need four bluray discs (or a new technology altogether). The cables and internal circuitry of your Bluray players, AV receivers and so on would need to be four times faster. If you're a cable operator, you can only fit one-fourth the number of channels over your bandwidth. Etc etc etc. No doubt this gets fixed in time, but the easy way out is to simply compress the 4K signal a little more, so you get something that's technically 4K, but isn't really four times the picture quality.All that aside, Sony has a fine product here, and it's definitely worth an audition if you're looking for a stunning TV that breaks the 65\" barrier.", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not exactly what I hoped for", "Author": "Doodle Meriwether", "ReviewID": "R3LBMY7I5KVIM1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm really impressed with the 2D picture quality, especially the detail and color when using a good source. Native 4K will look the best (when its available), but even an upscaled blu-ray looks amazing. Upscaled cable channels do not look any better than regular HD, since they are compressed signals. I haven't seen any of the available remastered 4K titles yet, but from what I understand they are still only 1080p and so will not look much (if any) better than an upscaled 1080p blu-ray. 4K content from YouTube looks great, but again, the signals are compressed so its not really true 4K. The TV handles SD very well which was one of my concerns. It won't turn an SD picture (especially analog cable) into a Monet painting like I have found some TVs will do. The sound from the built-in speakers is fabulous. Its nice having the option to have great sound anywhere you decide to put this TV. My only wish would be to have covers for the speakers as they give off some reflections that can be distracting. The TV has a lot of other nice \"smart TV\" features like access to a multitude of cool apps. Other reviewers have gone into much greater detail about the positives so I don't want to be redundant.Now for the bad. The flashlighting from corners in dark scenes is atrocious and possibly the worst that I've seen on a TV (see pictures... nevermind, the pictures were taken down). Maybe an exchange would alleviate this. The 3D on this set is very good, but while it claims to push passive 3D to the next level by delivering full HD to each eye, I have yet to see it. I'm seeing upscaled 540 + 540, i.e. the same 3D resolution you would get on a standard passive 3D TV. There are no details in the manual or online explaining how to achieve full HD 3D. After several calls to Sony support I still don't know how. They can't even tell me what it takes to make this work. Though I was hoping to be able to use my current blu-rays in a 4K upscaling player to see full HD 3D, so far this doesn't work. Actually, I started out using the PS3 and was hoping that since its possible to deliver full HD 3D on an active set that maybe the PS3 with a standard 3D blu-ray would work. It doesn't. Passive 3D works by displaying both L+R at the same time, so it means the source must output 1080 + 1080.. basically it must output a 4K signal. I did a little research on 3D frame-packing but I'm still a little confused about how the output should be delivered for a passive 3D set or how the passive set should handle the signal. Anyway, so I ended up buying a 4K upscaling 3D blu-ray player. For maximum compatibility (or so I thought) I bought a Sony (BDP-s790). As I was saying before, this doesn't work either. It mentions in the manual of the s790 that in order to view 4K 3D you must turn 3D OFF in the settings! First of all, this makes no sense! Second, it doesn't make any difference and flat out doesn't work, i.e. you cannot even play a 3D movie with 3D turned OFF on the player. I had Sony on the phone two separate times and we could not get it working. They are not even sure what is required! I thought I had seen full HD 3D on this set at best buy when they did a demo, but I don't know how they did it. Needless to say, I'm a little frustrated... by the lack of 3D resolution (and flashlighting). Sony was supposed to call me back yesterday with some more details... if I ever get that info I will post it here. Actually, I think I recall getting a business card from the Sony rep that was demoing the TV at Best Buy. If I can find the card maybe I will contact her.If you own this set and are seeing full HD 3D then please let me know how. To be sure you are seeing full HD 3D you should be able to see about 35-40 lines of resolution per vertical inch (while wearing the 3D glasses). If you are able to count only 20 bright lines (based on a 55\" TV) then you are getting only 540 per eye. You can also use the TV \"DISPLAY\" button while playing the movie - the TV will show the resolution in the top left corner. You should have a \"4K\" signal indicated (3840x2160) if you are getting full HD 3d, i.e. it should not say \"1080p\".The TV also comes with HDMI 1.4 which does have its limitations when compared to the soon coming HDMI 2.0. Sure, you're never going be able to buy electronics that don't become obsolete eventually, but I would hate to get stuck with a brand new TV that is obsolete right out of the box. I've heard that Samsung will be offering an upgrade kit for some models in their lineup. Its rumored that Sony will also. I also don't like that I can't zoom a 4K source (2D). I like having the option to zoom a video with an aspect ratio that leaves black bars (e.g 2:35:1). Not having the option to do this is a little annoying.7/2/13 update:Had another call with Sony today. They are making my decision on this TV very easy. It will be returned. Regarding the 3D, I was told that Full HD 3D will only be supported with a 4K 3D source (e.g. a 4K 3D blu-ray), but when that would be available was unknown. The demo I saw at Best Buy was using a remastered 4K blu-ray and the TV was set for 2D->3D conversion, i.e. it was not a legitimate 3D blu-ray. I don't believe anyone owning this set is getting FULL HD 3D, yet. I would like to be proven wrong (tell me you see \"4K 3D\" resolution when you press the DISPLAY button on the remote). I can't say that I feel deceived since it was never stated anywhere that one would be able to use their current 3D blu-ray collection for full HD 3D. It was simply my assumption and I think a lot of folks might assume the same. I still think the 3D is the best 540p 3D I've seen on a TV though. There's nearly zero ghosting. Its just not full resolution, bummer. This alone wouldn't necessarily cause me to return the TV if the other annoyances were resolvable. Unfortunately, Sony told me flat out that flash-lighting and screen non-uniformity were a problem on all LCD/LED TVs and there was nothing they could do. No suggestions on how to possibly mitigate it. No concern about the severity of it. Up yours, Sony. You're not getting my money. I wanted to love this TV. I do like it, but not enough to spend five grand. I'll let the 4K dust settle a bit and wait for offerings from other manufacturers.7/3/13 update:I've thought about the 3D picture more and I think there actually are 1080 rows of pixels per eye, but read on.... I see 540 bright \"lines\" per eye. However, per line there are 2 rows of pixels. So technically there are 1080 rows of pixels per eye, but this will not give you an HD 3D picture. I was expecting it to alternate every row of pixels, not every two rows. The way its displayed leaves a lot of black space between each line and though it may technically be 1080, it does not look \"Full HD\" but looks more like standard passive 3D (540p) with the accompanying loss of sharpness.As we all know, a 1920x1080 TV would display passive 3D by alternating rows of pixels, 540 rows for the left eye, 540 for the right eye. Below are shown a couple of rows for one eye with the \"space\" between the two rows of lit pixels (each \"O\" is a lit pixel) being for the image for the other eye . So, there would be 540 such \"lines\" for each eye:OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOThe 4K TV is currently displaying passive 3D (with current 3D blu-ray) by alternating double rows of pixels, 540 double-pixel rows for the left eye, 540 double-pixel rows for the right eye. Below is shown a double row of pixels for one eye followed by a double row of space, followed by another double row of pixels. The row of space in between would be for the image for the other eye.I.e. for each eye there are two rows of lit pixels followed by 2 rows of \"space\" followed by two rows of lit pixels, etc (each \"8\" is a stack of two lit pixels). So, there would be 540 such \"lines\" per eye (each row of \"8\"s being a bright line on the screen).8888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888This is really just upscaled 540p per eye. The 3D on this TV may look just slightly better than a standard 2K TV passive 3D because of the increased resolution from the higher number of pixels, but it still suffers from the large gap between each bright line which subtracts from the sharpness.This is not the marketed 1080p Full HD 3D that Sony claims and it cannot be had with a standard 3D blu-ray. From what I am told by Sony a future 4K 3D disk (or digital content) will be able to provide an input signal to the TV that will yield real full HD 3D. Your current 3D blu-ray collection will look a little better on this TV but its still not FULL HD 3D just yet.Update 7/5/13:Dynamic LED settings do not seem to help the flashlighting issueUpdate 7/11/13I've returned the TV due to the flashlighting. I may reorder and just hope I don't have the same issues.Update 9/23/13I just reordered the TV. I will update review soon after...TV again returned for yet another screen anomaly. There's about a thumb-sized area, of irregular shape, top center of TV where its missing color. There's only white light coming through. The corner flash-lighting is not as bad but the light bleed on both sides is a little annoying, but not really distracting and only obvious when its a really dark scene, but there's also like a faint thick line running vertical on both sides. Giving up on this TV. Picture is really really beautiful, sound is really really awesome but there are too many quality issues for this kind of money. If someone ever comes out with a 4K TV with full array LED, great sound, passive 3D, and none of the issues the Sony has had I'll buy it. Hmm, hello LG, Vizio.11/29/13I've had the opportunity to see the LG 4K TV, LA9650, at Best Buy. I can only comment on the passive 3D of the LG since I have not spent enough time with the TV overall, but the 3D is, in fact, full 1080p per eye, unlike my experience with this Sony. They were using a Pioneer 3D player, don't know which model. I really wonder how Sony can achieve full 1080p 3D. From my understanding it seems to me that the panel must have the right filter applied to achieve full 1080p, i.e. its a physical thing on the passive 3D TV itself and not a software or 3D source issue. I'm not sure about this though and I hope I'm wrong. The LG also has the ability to \"Cinema Zoom\", so it can zoom a 3D source and eliminate the horizontal black bars in movies with aspect ratios which do not fill the screen.

To summarize I ordered the first set initially from Amazon, had Pilot deliver it a week later (after missing three promised delivery dates in the process) and finally set it up. I was able to enjoy it for less than 48 hours before it developed a propensity to shut off after about 30 seconds of use multiple times, then give me the \"LED flashes 8 times\" code. Looking on the internet, another person had the same issue and attributed it to a faulty power supply, which made sense based on the symptoms.After a useless call to Sony, I called Amazon who came through with sending me a replacement tv. On the scheduled delivery date of my second set, good ol' Pilot actually had no idea where the television was. They had to call all of their ports and finally located the tv sitting on a dock in Ohio. Needless to say the second set again was delayed by about 5 days. Apparently these large-item shipping delays \"rarely happen\" but it occurred to me twice in a month. Go figure. At least after being quite vocal about this whole ordeal (squeaky wheels get the grease, right?), I got a 10% refund, which for this tv is a huge deal.Anyway, the television looks incredible. Of course, my previous television was a 40\" rear-projection LCD Sony from 2005, which admittedly would make any $150 flat panel tv from Walmart look like a 4k in comparison, but seriously this television is a work of art hanging on the wall.

Having 3840 x 2160 resolution is a dream come true. This is only a review for the XBR-55X900A. This TV was purchased from a big box retailer and when i mean big box i mean BB. At any rate I bought this at the same time i purchased the brand new MSI Dragon 2 Notebook. This notebook does have the new Haswell chipset which is more than capable of driving this display, but it also has a discrete NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780M 4g DDR5 video card. So suffice to say that this notebook rocks. I connected the notebook via HDMI with an Audioquest Carbon cable. Should be simple enough?This is where the fun begins. To my dismay once it was synced at 3840 x 2160 it runs at 24hz. For the life of me i haven't seen any display run this for at least 10 yrs. Why on earth would anyone want to run their display at 24hz. To Sony's point they do list their specs:Video Signal : 3840x2160/24p ; 3840x2160/25p ; 3840x2160/30p ; 4096x2160/24p ; 1080/24p (HDMI only) ; 1080/60i ; 1080/60p(HDMI / Component) ; 480/60i ; 480/60p ; 720/60p ; 1080/30p (HDMI only) ; 720/30p (HDMI only) ; 720/24p (HDMI only)Sure the TV will run 60hz at 1920x1080 but then again so will any TV on the market today. In fact you can find one for $500 or less. How does this make any sense? The flagship TV from Sony runs slower than its discontinued models? No I did not read the specs. I just figured a TV that is the flagship should be at least the same or better for refresh rates. My bad Sony you got me there.The worst part about this TV though is the gray lines. No this has nothing to do with input. Take your remote hit the home key and look at the inputs. The white background has gray lines in it. Look carefully.  Once you notice them once you will forever see this flaw. Sure could it have been a defective TV? Sony sent me a replacement mind you it took almost a month to get it. The replacement had the same issue. So maybe I just have the worst luck in the world and it just so happens that i received two bad TV's. I did go and check the TV out at my local big box store. Now at this occasion the Sony reps were actually present at this store. They showed me their white test and once again the gray lines were there. After several attempts by them to rectify the gray lines alas they could not.  They did however point out that if you dont have a super white background those lines are a moot point. The conclusion they came up with this TV is not good to be used as a monitor. That is quite a shocking answer.I am sorry Sony I am huge fanboy of your products, but this is quite the letdown. Not only are you pushing a refresh rate that is ridiculously outdated. But the whites with the gray lines make the TV unacceptable. If this is indicative of what a flagship product is supposed to be like, I think Sony might be headed out to pasture.", "Date": "July 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Is it worth it?  Kinda??", "Author": "LM1000 \"LM\"", "ReviewID": "R38YMIZXUGJGFC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Ok, I'm writing this review based on a few things:  1.  Having done extensive research on this product and on 4k televisions in general.  2.  Seeing the Demo unit at the store and watching it for what seemed like an hour (on a couple of visits) and most importantly... 3.  Having a very close friend purchase one and spend a boatload of cash to be the first of our group to have one.  So here are my thoughts:It is a Good television.  1080p broadcast over a cable box, or a 1080p blu ray look as good as on just about any other tv.  Not necessarily better than on other TVs but they look good.  4k content looks very good...but here is the deal.  If you are sitting 8 feet more more away, I cannot tell ANY difference between this and a 1080p set.  If you are 6-8 feet away, I THINK I can tell a difference, but I'm not sure (I'm not sure if I think there is a difference but am trying to convince myself there is one)  In all reality, you really have to be standing (or sitting) right up close to the TV to tell a difference for sure.Now here is the problem with that (at least for me). Sure, this would be great for most people in a huge set (80 inches plus) or to enjoy a 60 incher 4k tv from just a few feet away. BUT, when I sit that close, I find I don't enjoy watching the TV that much.  After a little while, I find my eyes are having to move around too much to catch details on the screen that are happing on the far left or right.  If you think it sounds silly, try watching a sporting event or a movie on your current set from just 2 feet away, it is fatiguing to your eyes, not from the strain of the light, but from how much you have to move around to watch things.  So personally, I find watching television and moves most enjoyable when I am, say, at least 6 feet away from a 50 inch screen, or 8 feet from a 60 inch screen. And at that distance, there really isn't much of a differene between 4k content and 1080p content.So overall, the set is a good set, but it is really only an improvement from distances or from a set so big that make it 'uncomfortable' to watch for extended periods of time.", "Date": "August 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "$5k TV delivered DOA", "Author": "Marc Desin", "ReviewID": "RAYAOHE5ZA6KI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "For the price I paid for this TV, I would have expected Sony and Amazon to make sure that the it worked.

So you can sit about the same distance you'd sit from a 40 inch TV, but get a grander, more theatrical experience.  Except that 4k in a theater is much further away, so it's much more vivid to be able to sit close and see all this detail.  At the Sony Store in Manhattan, they have a bench about 8 feet back from it (if I recall correctly).Now I would give this TV 5 out of 5, but alas at this point, the price is ridiculous.

I have reviewed this Sony product, and it is a beautiful component indeed, but I urge buyers to consider one very important factor when purchasing Sony products, CAN THEY BE REPAIRED.  I was NEVER so shocked to find out that after (7) years my SCD-1 Flagship $5,000.00 SACD player could no longer be repaired by Sony Corporation, NO parts and NO service, not even a consideration of service.  Since that time I have spoken to retailers and shared my experience, and their response, wow, you were lucky, we have sold products people have tried to have repaired at Sony repair facilities even after TWO years and there are no parts, and what can we do as a Sony retailer, NOTHING, it's just a problem that there seems to be no answer for!  Sony Corporation is simply too big, manufacturers far too many products to support them all, it's just a painful fact.After I personally spent $5,000.00 on an SACD player, the SCD-1, I never, ever anticipated I would be facing no parts after 7 years, but that is exactly what happened to me.  I now own a  brushed aluminum \"boat anchor\".  If you pay good money for a Sony product, especially a high end or ES product, be prepared to be UNABLE to secure service or parts somewhere between the 2-7 year mark.  I have been told it all depends on how well the component sells, in my case the SCD-1 was an audiophile piece, limited production strictly, so they cut parts and repair off quickly.  When you choose Sony, you probably assume they can repair the component for an unlimited amount of time, as I foolishly did, but I can assure you, YOU ARE ON THE CLOCK THE SECOND THE PRODUCT IS MANUFACTURED, NOT the date you purchase it.  If a product is out for a few years, that time line then becomes 4, 3 or 2 years for you, and that's if you even get the full 7 years of service and parts to begin with. No one ever considers what happens AFTER the warranty, and you need to be prepared to have no parts and no service available to you, and for me, that is simply unacceptable, but I learned the hard way.  You might think, well I will have my Sony component fixed by someone else, WRONG, you can't find the parts to what was probably a Sony product with proprietary design. Can you imagine purchasing an audiophile component for $5,000.00 and be told, we apologize for any inconvenience, but we no longer carry any parts for your player, nothing, not even a remote control, and we no longer support the product. To add the ultimate insult to injury, the Sony Laredo repair facility, their primary repair facility,  badly damaged my SACD player that they would not and could not repair, both at the facility and shipping it back to me.  When a product arrives at the facility, I was told the first thing they do is check when the product was manufactured, as I told you, the clock is ticking the second the product is manufactured. What good is any great component, when it can't be repaired?  It's one thing to pay a few hundred bucks for a component that can be thrown away, but to pay $5,000.00 for a Flagship product and be abandoned by Sony Corporation, it certainly made an impression on me.  Hey, if you have any reservations about what I'm saying, check out Sony Complaints and you will be blown away, I certainly was.

I do not even like Panasonic, just the Vierra plasma television mentioned in my review.) Do NOT waste your money on 4K televisions. They are overhyped, overpriced wastes of plastic. I am a former high-end television salesman and current videophile who ordered one based on the rave reviews of so-called expert critics. Its reportedly high defective and glitch rates aside, the $4,000 Sony XBR-55X900A has an overall picture that cannot even live up to that of my $1,000 Panasonic TC-P50ST60.  A television is only as good as its source material and 4K broadcasts are not even available where I live. The signals which are available actually look better on the Panasonic. By better, I mean clearer, sharper, prettier, smoother, and far more realistic and vivid. The Sony was a tad brighter, even after making maximum adjustments on both sets, but it just did not have the excitement and charisma of Panasonic's Plasma.  I did witness an actual 4K demonstration on the Sony, which was impressive but no more so than Panasonic's newest better plasmas. The only advantage of the Sony is that the sound is marginally clearer and the features somewhat more extensive and cutting edge. The latter characteristic means nothing to me, because I merely use TV's to watch broadcast signals and an occasional movie, and do all of my fancy footwork on my powerful, gorgeous, and reliable 27-inch Imac. The sad thing is that consumers judge TV's based on how their screens look in brightly lit stores. Some stores even deliberately tone down the pictures of low-profit brands like Panasonic. Trust me, the TC-P50ST60's picture will look infinitely finer in the real world than those of most TV's at any price, especially in your home in low to medium light. If you must go with a Sony 4K, choose the 55-inch because the smaller the screen, the sharper the images. You could do worse, much worse, but why pay four times what a better TV (the Panasonic) costs?

The only way the human eye can distinguish it is if you sit less than 3.5 feet from your TV.  Is 4K great? Yeah if you can fit a 100 inch tv in your house or you own a movie theater. I love people that fall for the hype.4K reading material....Will I be Able to Notice the Additional Resolution?To be able to detect the additional resolution of 4k (or 8k), the screen must be large enough and you must sit close enough. So how do you know if your particular setup would benefit?  Here's your answer.Based on the resolving ability of the human eye (with 20/20 vision it is possible to resolve 1/60th of a degree of an arc), it is possible to estimate when 4k resolution will become apparent for the average eyeball.For a 84-inch screen, 4k resolution isn't fully apparent until you are at least 5.5 feet or closer to the screen. For a \"tiny\" 55-inch screen, you'll need to be 3.5 feet or closer. Needless to say, most consumers aren't going to sit close enough to see any of extra resolution 4k offers, much less 8k.1080p 3-D Content on Passive (polarized) ScreensThere may still be one benefit these screens can offer and it's when watching 3-D Blu-ray movies. There are two types of 3-D glasses: more expensive Active Shutter glasses and lower-cost Passive Polarized Lens glasses. Active Shutter glasses deliver the full screen resolution to each eye; Polarized Glasses deliver only half the screen resolution to each eye (540 instead of 1080 vertical lines)4k allows all 1080 lines to be visible when using Passive Polarized glasses, so long as you are sitting close enough to view 1080p (see chart above.) You wouldn't be able to get the full benefit from 4k 3-D, but 4k content doesn't really exist anyway.What about 4k and 8k Content?If you are among the rare few who has a giant screen and sits close enough to it to benefit from 4k resolution, will you still see much benefit? The answer is still \"Probably not.\" Regardless of screen resolution, the source material needs to have the same resolution as the display to see any real advantage. Video Processors will upscale any input to 4k resolution, but upscaling only offers a marginal improvement. Until true 4k and 8k content is widely available, which is a long way off, you are better off saving your cash and getting a 1080p HD TV instead.As of this writing, the only readily available content source for 4k is the Sony PlayStation 3, and it can only display static pictures (not moving video) using the HDMI connection. This may be worthwhile for photographers, but probably not for anyone else.In conclusionThe benefits of 4k and 8k are marginal at best. You have to sit unrealistically close to see the full detail and you also need 4k and 8k source material, which is virtually non-existent. If you want a 3D TV that uses Passive Polarized Glasses, you will be able to view 1080p content at full resolution. If you want to use a PS3 to view 4k photos, you could benefit from 4k. And if you use it as a computer monitor to view high resolution source material, you could benefit. Other than that, save your cash and purchase 1080p instead.ISF states the the most important aspects of picture quality are (in order): 1) contrast ratio, 2) color saturation, 3) color accuracy, 4) resolution.
