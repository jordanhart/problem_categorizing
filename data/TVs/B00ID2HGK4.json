{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Picture quality - Buggy firmware = 3 stars pending????", "Author": "Elisa and Teddy", "ReviewID": "RHWEDQQB23XDW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying that I hate being an early adopter, but I did so because I needed a new TV. Having said that, I am returning it and going to try a replacement 7150.Strengths of this TV are:The panel that is on this TV is amazingly uniform. I cannot see any banding, clouding or DSE on a white image or in bright action scenes - Hockey for example.  Did I mention there is no DSE or clouding on this panel. That is amazing to me.Borrowed calibration settings made this TV really come to life.  It renders color very well and life-like. On all sources, digital streaming, Blu-ray, live TV and digital TV.  Great picture quality. It has good contrast and while \"inky blacks\" are not there - the blacks presented are very, very, good.Smart features are good and the quad core processor flies through the settings and menus easily.The Bad:There is just a minute amount of blooming or haloing when highly contrasting objects appear onscreen together.This unit was very susceptible to \"judder\" or cadence stuttering from air and DTV stations.  I am very observant when it comes to motion stuttering on video.  It drove me nuts, it was random and happened quite often on all channels and incoming signal resolutions. Sometimes my wife even noticed.  When my wife asks \"why is it doing that?\" there is something wrong.  I tried turning on and off all motion compensation settings - No Go!  Off board Roku, Blu-ray sources were fine and solid - I never really use the judder or Blur settings - always off.Finally - the smart-hub kept locking me out of app streaming from the TV apps (Netflix and amazon prime).  Every 4 or 5 hours it would say that the streaming service was not available.  I called Samsung support and the adviser remotely reset the smart-hub, and region settings.  It worked for a while and then I had to reset all over again - 3 more times before I decided there was something wrong.I don't know if this is just buggy initial firmware, or I maybe received a bad unit, but the picture quality on this thing is worth giving a replacement another try.I started my hunt to replace my previous TV with a modern LED TV about a month ago.  First I tried a 2013 Panasonic 58\" TC-L58E60 - Terrible banding and DSE but great smart apps and fast wi-fi connectivity. I Then tried a 2014 LG 60LB6500 that exhibited a horrible pink color on the right and left side of panel - plus the calibrator said I should exchange because the panel seemed out of spec.  Moved up to the direct LED LG 60LB7100 - same pink coloration on left side???? Its too bad, the viewing angles for those sets are really very good. I am now hoping the replacement 7150 will resolve the smart-hub issues. I'll update when I have the replacement.****************UPDATE******************I have decided  to return the 2nd attempt at this model.  Actually, I tried the Costco 7100 model.  This model had the HH01 panel, unfortunately I did not check to see which panel came with the 7150 from amazon.  The 7100 had the same price and it came with the bluetooth keyboard included in the package.  That was a nice little extra but not enough for me to overcome my objections to the set.Here's what I found:This panel showed the same excellent uniformity without DSE or banding on bright action scenes that the 7150 displayed. But, It definitely had more noticeable flash lighting present on dark scenes. I could actually notice the light spilling onto video  from the lower left corner during night scenes. It wasn't overly distracting to me but was visible while watching Master and Commander and Jack Reacher.I failed to mention previously that the viewing angle on the 7150 was very narrow, it's contrast and color seemed to suffer when I sat outside maybe 30 degrees from direct  frontal viewing.  This 7100 panel was no different with its fairly shallow viewing angle. Still, the picture was very good with colors and uniformity in normal viewing.  Very much like the 7150 I had before with just slightly more flashlight effect.I decided to return it because it was also very much like the 7150 in its weak points . There definitely seems to be something wrong with the motion and cadence handling from DTV and OTA tv.  At one point I had the 7100 next to my tried and true Samsung LN40B630. The 630 had no issues with the cadence or stuttering on the same channels.  Also, I kept getting kicked out of the favorite channel list editing in the menu.  I have to believe there is some firmware issues that have just not been resolved. While I did not have the problem with the smart-hub that I had on the 7150, there were some freezing issues with the netflix and amazon prime apps.  I could not resolve these issues, and my roku 3 did not hiccup by comparison.If I had the patience and nerve I might wait to see if a firmware fix would actually resolve these issues - I don't. I'm back to the hunt.", "Date": "April 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Beautiful TV, super slim and light! *updated*", "Author": "OregonBay \"\u00a9 OregonBay - 1999 to 2014\"", "ReviewID": "R4QD6N08PUVKZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "*Update June 3, 2014*Ok, I raised the rating to five stars because I discovered today that there is a new app on the App Store that works for the screen mirroring and what they call \"smart view\" which allows you to watch broadcast TV on your TV and iPad simultaneously, along with being able to change the channels, adjust volume, etc...The app you need is the Smart View 2 app, it says it's for 2014 or newer TV's, but it works on this one.*End edit*Original Review Follows--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I just upgraded to this TV from a six year old Mitsubishi TV which unfortunately began having a LCD issue.  I really didn't want to buy a new TV yet, but as it is...I decided on this model due to price and features.  Important features to me included being at least a 55\", LED backlighting, Wi-Fi, 3D, and HDMI 1.4a for the Audio Return Channel (ARC).  This TV met all of my requirements and includes many extra features as well.The TV itself is super slim, it's about 1/3 as thick as my Mitsubishi TV was (it was a CCFL backlight LCD), it's also really lightweight and has a really super-thin bezel -- and I thought the bezel on my Mit was thin!The contrast and clarity of the screen is very good, much better than my old set.  The LCD runs on the cool side of the color spectrum -- which is what I like.  When set to \"cool\" in the settings it comes out too blue, I usually set my LCD's to cool but on this one I went with the normal setting as it is already cool enough.There are tons of built in features with this TV, however I'll discuss some of the ones I've already ran into problems with in the CONS section below, and that is the reason I rated this at four vs. five stars.* Unboxing *Well packaged, Apple-esq packaging.  I received this with the Amazon Enhanced service, so it was unboxed, assembled, and tested by the delivery person (nice touch).  In the box is the TV, Stand, a Standard Remote, a Smart remote (which functions a little like a touchpad in the air), an IR extender, and two sets of active shutter 3D glasses.  Included also is a user manual and all the usual paperwork.* Installation *Easy.  I watched the delivery guy assemble -- it had two stand pieces that had to be installed on the back of the unit with bolts, then attached to the stand with bolts.  It took him about two or three minutes to assemble and it was ready to plug in and go.With the Audio Return Channel there are few wires actually going to the TV.  I have two HDMI cables, the one from my receiver and one from a security camera DVR, the power cord, and the included IR receiver extender.* Setup *Again, easy.  It walks you through the usual internet connection settings, and other settings.  It's truly Apple-esq.* Video *The video clarity is very good, it's very crisp, clean.  I popped in Planet Earth and found it to be somewhat better looking on this TV vs. my old TV.  The LED backlighting is very even on this TV, I haven't found any \"flashlighting\" or anything like that.  Contrast is very good for a LED LCD, blacks are black without much clipping, and whites are white.* Audio *The built in speakers are pretty good, haven't used them much as I use a receiver.  It's pretty much what you can expect from a TV today.* Smart TV *Ok, this is both good and bad, the smart TV functions very well and is fast with the quad-core processor, however I have ran into some problems with some of the features.  Apps work as expected, but the web browser is not so good, it's hard to use as expected without a keyboard and mouse connected -- that in and of itself isn't unexpected, but I tried using it with the Picture in Picture (PIP) function and it didn't release the audio back to the TV upon completion of use, forcing me to unplug the TV and replug to get audio back.  In addition it doesn't work with sites like the History Channel for streaming shows, a big deal-breaker for me.  This is why I never use these web browsers.* App connectivity *This is where I reduced the rating from five stars to four stars, I downloaded the app from the App Store for my iPhone and iPad and neither would work with the TV, the TV is detected and the App says to click on \"allow\" on the TV, however there is no where I can find that says \"allow\" on the TV.  I understand Samsung is a competitor to Apple in many areas, but if you're going to offer an App for the TV on the App Store, make sure it works, otherwise just don't offer it.* Inputs/Outputs *Probably adequate for most modern setups, however many of the outputs on the back of the unit are not recessed, that might be a problem for some who wish to wall mount this TV.- RecessedThree HDMI inputs, three USB inputs, one Coax for Over the Air (antenna) or Cable.- Not recessedOne HDMI input, a combined component/composite input, ethernet, IR extender, a 3.5mm audio out, digital optical out (toslink), and another output I don't know what it's for...* Build Quality *The unit feels solid and looks nice.  The stand is stainless steel looking, it goes well with stainless/black components.I'll go over the pros and cons:PROS+ Appearance -- Looks nice, slim, sleek, thin bezel, nice stand.+ LCD -- Great picture quality, video is smooth, and the LED lighting is very good to great.+ SmartTV -- Most of the apps work as expected, and there are lots of apps to choose from.+ Setup/Use -- Easy to setup and use, the Wi-Fi works well with everything I have.+ Size/Weight -- Super slim, weighs very little.  This would be easy to wall mount.CONS- App connectivity -- The iPhone/iPad app doesn't work with my setup.- Physical connections -- Some aren't recessed, might make it hard to wall mount.- Web Browser -- It's not as full functioning as they might want you to believe.- PIP function -- Didn't work right with the Web Browser, as I stated above it didn't release the audio to the TV upon completion of using the web browser.Overall:I like it, it was definitely worth the money in my opinion and it's a big upgrade for me.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this TV to most people.  If you are looking to wall mount this you may need to find a mount which will allow for the inputs, but that's probably not going to be a problem.  If it wasn't for the app issues and web browser issues I would have rated this five stars.Highly recommended, but with a few caveats.", "Date": "April 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very good picture, mixed 3D \"experience\" and buggy software", "Author": "T. Boy \"Audio Snob ;-)\"", "ReviewID": "R3JJMRE7PVSR7B", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First off, I've only owned this for two weeks, but now that the ooo's and ahh's have worn off, I think I can be a little more objective.Picture:Quite stunning with contrast, saturation and black levels for an LED (coming from a plasma). On a black screen (used Spears & Munsil blu-ray for calibration), the backlight does bloom from the corners, though I don't notice it in active viewing, even with dark scenes. This could be the local dimming doing its work, so I will not discount it too much, but worth noting.I use digital over-the-air broadcasts to watch TV. On my Panasonic plasma, these were exceptionally clear. On this TV there is much MPEG blockiness that I note on the HD channels viewing from about 6 feet away. For broadcasters who offer the same channel in both standard and HD, I really noticed no difference. That's not really a good thing. I read a review that this was supposed to be a strength of this model, but I beg to differ in real use. Since one of the primary reasons for spending a premium on this is because it is a television, I dropped a star.Where this unit shines on picture is on streaming HD and blu-ray. Using these as source material really make the picture wow me. Netflix HD streamed flawlessly via wireless and the picture was spot on. Natural colors, sharp detail, no disturbing amounts of flicker/judder (with \"assistance\" settings turned off mind you), it is the best way to appreciate the premium price for this unit. Shadows details were exceptional, giving me quite an appreciation for the advancements in LED TVs - as I never thought I would give up plasma.3D:So I decided I would try the 3D. I love 3D movies in the theaters and have enjoyed them at a friend who has a passive 3D Sony TV. The picture brightness and color is surprising adjusted well for 3D viewing. If you remove your glasses to view it, you can definitely tell there is major color shift and contrast changes to account for it. I was impressed with this aspect of the 3D picture.This TV uses active 3D, and most pro reviews said this TV would provide a better experience than most active 3D TVs. I guess I am sensitive to the refresh rates, because I could definitely notice the flickering of the glasses - which by the way are more comfortable than I expected - and I don't know that I will use 3D as much as I'd like. That's a big disappointment for me, but I suppose that's why you pay so much for the 3D movie theater.I would avoid the 2D-to-3D conversion unless you like the feeling of vertigo (maybe your kids will enjoy this). It just makes me feel sea sick as things that shouldn't stick out do, and vice versa. Interesting idea, but without real depth data, what could you really expect current technology to do on the fly?Problems were had using the SmartHub 3D \"experience\" via wireless would not work for me. I would get major amounts of buffering and then it would kick me out of the app and back to the previous source I was watching. The only way I got the \"experience\" to work was to hard wire the ethernet connection. Considering I get about 35 Mbs via wireless, I was a little surprised by this.One more thing about the 3D, it does not seem to support YouTube 3D, though it attempts to decode it. I've tried different settings in the 3D menu, but none seem to work well. I'll keep trying and post any update if I find the setting that works.Sound:This TV is wafer thin (okay a slight exaggeration, but close). What can you expect for sound then? It's listenable for the news, but if you spend this much for the picture you want to spend for sound as well, as you just will be disappointed otherwise. Like most of these flat panel designs, the manufacturers expect you to use a soundbar or AV receiver. Not much more to say about it than that.Smart TV features:I really didn't plan to use this much, as I do have a Home Theater PC (HTPC). However, I've used it much more than I expected and if I didn't have so much stored on the PC, I'd consider putting it to rest. The overall interface launches quickly and is easy to navigate. It is very responsive and the variety of apps is impressive. I mostly use Netflix and YouTube, and both were easy to use and produced great pictures (well, YouTube is only as good as what was uploaded, so this really applies mostly to Netflix). Some of the other apps would randomly kick me out like the 3D experience I mentioned earlier. I recently had a firmware upgrade pushed, but it doesn't seem to have changed this behavior. Another star dropped. I'll patiently wait for improvements...Remotes:Yes, that is plural. There are two different remotes supplied. A more traditional backlit button remote for the tactile types (like me) and a \"magic\" remote. I'm not a remote snob, so I can say my only gripe with the traditional-style remote is that the directional buttons seem too low on the control for me. Otherwise, it works as expected. Almost all of the buttons are backlit, but I like button remotes because I don't have to look at them.As for the magic remote (or whatever Samsung calls it), it's small, fits in your hand well, but I guess I'm not a fan. To me, as remote shouldn't have a learning curve and I don't have the patience for getting it to work. I will admit, it is faster for entering text on the screen, but other than that, I still prefer the other. I guess Samsung must have tested this with users and thus included both remotes for this reason. Seems a bit silly to me. In the end, I'm probably going to revert back to my old Harmony remote anyway...I'm not one to write reviews for a $10 item I purchased, but since I spent over $1k on this TV and rely heavily on user feedback, I felt obligated to provide this subjective review. In conclusion, this TV picture will initially provde a great wow factor, but the source will drive the HD levels. The digital tuner on this set was a disappointment for me, but otherwise, the picture is a stunner and will not disappoint you for movie watching and streaming content. If you are a big user of Smart TV features, this TV may cause you more frustration than enjoyment. While the interface is slick and responsive, its stability is greatly lacking - surprising for a company that makes top smartphones and tablets. I am ultimately keeping this TV, but if I had the choice again in the LED realm, I might have gone with a Sony instead...", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "1st Time LED TV buyer, overall--very satisfied.", "Author": "DVL \"DVL\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZPYM683GB8DY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must preface this first with a somewhat embarrassing fact.  In 2014 I still had a Sony Trinitron 36\" CRT television that was heavily used daily.  Finally came to grips with reality and figured that this television will outgrow my lifetime and will continue to operate long after I'm dead!?  I did not want to burden my children with the logistics of moving/removing this behemoth of a TV!Anyways, I thought I'd put my 2 cents on this Samsung LED TV after spending about 2 weeks with it.  As I mentioned before, I've spent 12+ years with a CRT TV so as far as image quality is concerned, I'm completely biased.  Any newer modern TV for me will look absolutely great, no matter what!  Image quality on this set is sharp, bright, and nicely vivid.  There are some oddities with moving images that seem to produce a slight stutter, about maybe every half second or less.  Doesn't really bother me now, but I do notice it.  It does not occur all the time, very intermittent.I like this TV's styling too, very thin and nice modern stand.Originally, I had so much trouble using the TV's smart features, I thought I had a defective unit and was very close to returning the product.  The first few days using the Smart Hub features and apps was a very unpleasant experience to say the least.  The TV's Smart Hub was extremely lagging and slow, simple operations like turning the volume up or down would take about 1 to 2 minutes to to respond--(not making this up).  Certain apps failed to stream or load all together, Amazon, Netflix, Vudu, pretty much everything I attempted to use was or became almost unresponsive.  Sometimes the TV would reboot on its own multiple times.  I spent a few days trying to figure out if I had a lemon, or if it was a buggy 1st-2nd release of firmware.  Luckily, I found a parameter that I disabled that made the TV smart features perform as intended.  Disabling the \"Instant On\" feature on this TV really made a positive difference in the overall performance of basic and advance features.  It probably adds another second or two powering up the TV, but no big deal. Smart Hub and apps still do occasional flake-out here and there, but doing this really improves things two-fold!The smart remote was much better than I expected and functioned very well.  The \"Wii-like\" pointing feature also works great, I like the fact that the pointer only shows up when you lay your thumb on the remote's touch pad.  I found myself inadvertently confirming different areas of the screen because the pointer always resets to the middle of the screen, no biggie, something else to acclimate to. I use a Harmony Touch remote and it also works well in controlling the TV...  No pointer obviously.Overall, this TV's picture and smart features are excellent.

It's thinner, is more vibrant picture, has no washout from angles, and has less glare on the screen in well lit rooms w/ windows, etc.  Blacks are really black.  Did I say it has a great picture?  The only drawback in my book is HDMI 4 sticks directly out the back, so if you have an ultra slim wall mount, get an angled hdmi cord if you need to use this 4th input.

Remembering the black & white sets of old and looking at this amazing product, I sometimes can't believe Star Trek technology is here today. This device is everything I wanted. Thin, attractive, bright, and sharp with the latest/greatest Linux-based technology driving its functions and applications. The picture is so sharp, it is almost surreal. Some people call it the \"soap opera effect,\" because the picture is so high resolution it looks real. At first it was a bit jarring, but now that I've adapted, I can't imagine watching anything else. There are options to \"tone down\" the unbelievable vividness and sharpness of the picture, but why buy this level of technology then bring it down? Watching some of my favorite shows, I can actually read a cell phone screen the character is holding. Of course, I had to try 3D and popped in several of my favorite movies. Equally amazing! The 3D picture is bright and sharp. The new styled 3D glasses are lightweight and comfortable. They're so thin and light you almost don't notice they are there.

My brand new 55\u201d Class UN55H7150. Let me first disclose that I am a die-hard Sony TV loyalist. I have not owned a non-Sony TV since 1985. That being said, when looking to upgrade and replace my 8-year old Bravia XBR 40\u201d (still working like new BTW), I looked into Sony\u2019s offerings. They really did a number on themselves with their reduced 2014 product offerings. Unless you want to take the plunge for a $3500 4K TV, you are kind\u2019ve out of luck . The performance stats for their top-line non-4K TVs were not so hot. 120Hz \u2013 really Sony? Also the reviews suggest that last year\u2019s 2013 models outperform their 2014. Their loss\u2026.So I read up on the new Samsung LED TVs and zeroed in on the H7150 series. 55\u201d seemed right for my room and not much bigger than my old 40\u201d that had a huge plastic border around the screen. I unpacked the new TV and the first thing that struck me was the weight. Goodness, it was like lifting a piece of plywood, not an anchor. Nice. The thin screen was nice too. Assembly took me all of 15 minutes. After straining my back moving the old set out of the way, I did nothing other than plug the HDMI into the new TV, put the wireless IR extender cable under my TIVO and turn it on.The Smart Hub remote setup was non-intuitive, but I followed the on-screen directions and fumbled my way through it. One negative about this process is that you would think for $1,500 Samsung could provide me with an actual paper instruction manual. I am all for paperless for some things, but the TV is a significant investment and a little easily accessible documentation on connections and setup would be useful. I hate reading 200 page pdf instruction manuals on my laptop. The TV connected to my secure wireless home network. Do yourself a favor and get a piece of paper and write down the model numbers of any set-top boxes, DVRs, disk players and router passwords you may need. It will save you some time.Here is the good thing. After fiddling around with the setup I was able to discover that my older TIVO HD DVR box was actually supported! For fellow TIVO users, you will recognize this as a bonus and nothing online indicated that the Smart Hub would interface with TIVO (in fact, some online reviews I later saw said you cannot \u2013 wrong!). It was not obvious and you have to retry cable box options three times before the software gives you an option to search for it, but there it is. Same for my Sony AV receiver. It was non-obvious and I could have easily given up early. So in the end, everything synched up. The software did an upgrade to v.1110 and rebooted the TV. The software upgrade only took a about a minute, not hours like some others have reported.Operation: I was impressed by the out of the box performance of this TV. I am sure I will spend the next few weeks tweaking the display settings as I am a stickler for image quality and hate washed out, over saturated images. Such images are easy to get out of this TV since there are a lot of settings that one can boost. It will take me a while to figure it out, but I can tell that the picture is pretty awesome. That is good news because I almost did not buy this TV after seeing a friends E-series Samsung last week (which I thought had a horrible picture. It was an older and cheaper model. The higher end 240Hz systems are worth the extra money.I tried a variety of channels on my cable network and have not yet even tried the Blue-ray signal that I have heard great things about with this TV.Sound: This is a thin TV. Really thin, and lightweight. Two factors that I knew would not lead to deep, full sound. That being said, the TV alone sound is ok. My wife hates loud TV (and I love it). So when she is out of the room I turn up my 5.1 AV system and it sounds great. When she is in the room I just use the TV sound and it is thin, but sufficient. Fine really. Apparently, I read in reviews here that I should hook the TV to my AV through the HDMI (ARC) connector to get this to work right. I will try that tonight. Like I said, there is a learning curve with this TV. I wish it was simpler. For those that like full sound with any bass, you will need a soundbar or AV system, but that should not come as a surprise to anyone building a home entertainment system. If it is a surprise, you have been warned.Smart TV: This is my first foray into smart TV and I will say that the smart tv made me feel pretty dumb. I am an Amazon Prime member, so the first thing I tried was streaming live HD content through Amazon. It was easy enough to link the TV to my account and the interface to Amazon was ok. The first night we tried to watch a couple of movies and there was a significant problem. It was a big enough problem that I was considering returning the TV the next day. While streaming, the picture would randomly zoom to the bottom 75% of the image \u2013 essentially cutting off the heads and anything else on the top of the movie. It would reset itself or you could manually get it right by pausing and restarting the movie. It took us 3 hours to get through a 2 hour movie. Really annoying. The image when it was working was awesome. I looked up this problem on the internet but saw nothing similar. At this point I knew I was in for some Customer service Hell. The next day I was on online chat with Samsung (no wait). The guy was nice, but in the end, after reinitializing the Smart hub and going through the whole Smart hub set-up all over again, the problem was not fixed. Samsung then pointed the finger at Amazon. I was not happy to hear that, but then got an on-line chat session going with a knowledgeable fellow from Amazon. He couldn\u2019t figure out the issue at first but then asked me to do one of the stupidest fixes \u2013 unplug the whole system for 30 seconds and plug back in. I was skeptical. Guess what? It worked. I watched a bunch of Amazon streaming content last night. Mostly a great picture, but there seem to be some bandwidth problems. One minute the image looks stunning and sharp but next there is some blurring a lowering of resolution and even pixilation/stutter. I may resort to getting a Belkin wireless router or the like and using that to connect to the TV via an Ethernet cable. I think wireless for streaming high bandwidth content with this TV is not so good. It is a major weakness of this TV. I have read similar comments about the poor wireless.Next: I will install my new Samsung 3D blu-ray player and mess around with the HDMI interface so that the sound integration is better. My initial impressions of this TV are quite positive. My support through Samsung and Amazon have been good so far. I am really enjoying the awesome image quality. It is the next level over my Sony. I fear I still have a lot of jostling to get it right, but I like a technical challenge as long as it is not something that I cannot fix. I am not happy about the TV wireless. I have 100mb service to my house and I am disappointed that I pay so much and things are not perfect. I will work on that. I will report back in a few days pershaps\u2026", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Buggy software, editing channel guide bricks TV, Don't buy!!", "Author": "Shawn Everson", "ReviewID": "RZTMVIW8TX3SN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "While the picture is amazing, the software is so buggy i can't recommend this TV. The 1st day after getting this TV I updated the firmware to 1109.3 when prompted to. All worked well after that. I then edited the guide  to remove channels that I didn't get. The TV then went in to a boot loop (power cycling every 10 seconds or so). There is no way to update the firmware except to have a service tech come out and replace the processor board. A week later a tech replaced the board and all worked well until I edited the guide channels to remove those that I didn't get or want to watch. Guess what? Same problem, TV is now in a boot loop. I'll have to get a tech to replace the processor board again. I'll never buy another Samsung TV again due to the poor software quality control.It isn't that hard to do unit tests on software to catch this kind of problem before releasing it. I do embedded firmware development for a living and we always do unit and regression testing before deploying any firmware. The other problem is that the boot loader doesn't have a way to recover from a bad firmware image. It wouldn't be that hard to have a way to load new firmware from a USB stick on powerup if, for example,  the user held the power button on the back for 10 seconds after power is applied..Save yourself time, money and frustration.

That experience was one of the main reasons I went with Samsung again.  Unfortunately, my experience with this 65-inch LED unit hasn't been as favorable.First off, the picture itself, when things are working correctly, is amazingly good.  When things are working correctly.My first unit had flash-lighting in all four corners, and it was really bad in the bottom corners.  I kept it for a week, hoping I could get used to it, but it was very noticeable and distracting in any semi dark scene.  I finally decided to send it back and got my new unit yesterday.  While the new unit still has some flash-lighting, it's nowhere near as bad as the previous unit, so I'm going to live with it.Auto-motion plus (AMP).  This feature appears to be severely broken.  Do a search on it and you'll find that many people have problems with it.  What's disturbing is that some of these AMP problems go back a couple of years, so it's not a new issue.  The highest setting I can use is \"clear\", which is the lowest AMP setting.  Any setting above that and I get video stuttering and/or the \"soap opera\" effect.Also, I was pretty excited to get a TV that has built-in support for Amazon and Netflix.  Unfortunately, the software seems buggy.  After I watched an Amazon movie a couple of nights ago, the Amazon app crashed on me.  Never had that happen with the Amazon app on the PS4.Also, the web browser seems slow and buggy at times.I'm hopeful that a future firmware upgrade will address some of the software issues.  However, it seems like companies are always moving on to next year's models so support for existing models seems to be getting worse and worse.I think picture wise the TV is probably a 4/5 stars but for the money I spent I expected more which is why I gave it a 3/5 stars.", "Date": "May 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "WOW!!!!Unbelievable picture and looks.", "Author": "aaaaaaaaaaa", "ReviewID": "R2WL2YB22SJTZO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like it.The picture and sounds are amazing.

It has been fantastic.  The setup procedure was straight forward. We have it mounted on the wall.  The back accepted the standard screws that came with the mounting bracket.The TV picture is nothing short of spectacular.  The images are crisp, the colors right on the mark and the contrast beautiful.  My wife best describes it as \"the people seem to be live inside the box\". The picture is that good.  In our case, we have tried the web browser and it is sufficient, however you will appreciate surfing the web on your laptop vs the TV. Its just easier.  The other apps for streaming videos work well.  The 3D content, although limited, is pretty cool. We bought and use the TV as a TV, without need for all of the special features previously listed.  We also have a blue-ray attached which is perfect. We are not video gamers, but rather a 60yr old couple, who enjoy watching movies, sports, etc \"the normal stuff\".  For that purpose, this TV could not be better.  The picture is THAT GOOD.  I realize there are better \"professional ratings\" for other units with bigger price tags.  After extensive research on all models, I came up with this as the best bang for the buck. It is instant on, no waiting for warm up, the picture is perfect.  That is all we need a TV for.  Although the sound quality is OK, I would strongly suggest using a sound bar or surround sound stereo unit.  With this type of large viewing area and total immersive entertainment experience, you need great sound.  The TV produces just ok sound, as does any other TV on the market.  They are TV's not stereos.  We are the type of people that will return a product if it does not meet our expectations. Always. We do not \"settle\" for \"good enough\" .  This TV has exceeded our expectations. Great set so far. No buyers remorse.

First off, the picture quality is truly amazing.  We keep the auto motion plus turned off when viewing HD cable broadcasts and also for blu-rays because the 240 refresh rate offers a very natural HD picture with no blur.  This is probably the single most important reason to step up to this television from the lower models.  We enjoyed our first at-home 3D movie last weekend and we chose The Hobbit.  It was a great experience, I had heard that the auto motion 'on' settings really shine with 3D and sure enough it really enhanced the picture quality.  I went with the 'smooth' setting and the active 3D really immersed us middle-earth.  Really pleased with this and we are already thinking of our next 3D movie.  It comes with 2 remotes, a standard remote and a smart remote.  The set is very aesthetically pleasing to me since I prefer the design of this stand over the other models.  Finally, the TV has a lot of options and it is worth playing around with them to see what suits you the best.  Rest assured, there is a setting you will be pleased with and probably more than one depending on the type of broadcast you are watching.  During the day we keep it on the standard (energy-saver) setting and in the evenings we go with the natural setting for a little extra brightness.

The picture is truly OUTSTANDING.  But I am quite disappointed with the Wifi and USB support.  Hence the 2 stars.I played around with the TV for an hour or so before connecting to the web. I was impressed. Once I tuned on Wifi all interaction became painfully slow. I got stuck in Netflix. I couldn't back out. I couldn't power off. I eventually pulled the plug. I decided I should try to upgrade to the latest firmware.... my original firmware was dated 2012!... Trying to set up the download the remote was sluggish. Once it started it was again painful... It took fifteen minutes to get the first download progress update. 1% ... 2 hours 29 minutes to complete.  So I again pulled the plug. Upon reboot I immediately turned off wifi...Remote reponse returned to normal.I next tried playing my home content that I had been viewing on the previous TV via an HDMI attached LG smartTV box. This content is all AVI, MP4,  and MKV. All played fine on the LG SmartTV box as well as my Win8 PC and  my android tablet. Only about half played on the Samsung built in USB. I kept getting messages that the format was not supported.  This content also plays  on  a 2 year old 40 inch Samsung SmartTV. So it appears the codecs are not the same.I hoped perhaps the new firmware update would correct this as well.My TV is around 45 feet from my router.  I have numerous devices that are 50+ feet away from router and work fine including a Wii game console attached to the TV has no wifi issues.. So it appears that the wifi is on the weak side in this Samsung TV.So I ran  a 100 foot ethernet cable through 2 rooms and a hallway. When I connected the TV it worked fine. In fact I could now run Netflix, Amazon prime, web browser. I downloaded the firmware took around 5 minutes. Reboot. Switched from wired to wifi..All the painful interaction returned. Again I had to pull the plug to power off the TV. Switched back to wired connection. All was well again...So did the firmware update fix my USB playback problems... Not a single extra video played. No better no worse.So I decided to attach the 3 year old LG SmartTV box to an HDMI port.This means I get none of the advantages of built in smart tv and USB. I still have this extra box.But I do have an OUTSTANDING picture.  I could have bought a cheaper model without the smarts and ended up exactly where I am now.=====Update after 6 days.======I got a comment from my review to try an ethernet wifi bridge. I bought one from Amazon... The Belkin universal 4 port HDTV wireless link. Only $27 in May 2014. This has let me attach the Samsung TV via Ethernet to the Belkin box. The Belkin box attaches via wifi to my router with a strong high speed signal. Something the built in Samsung Wifi would not do. This lets me enjoy the built in smart TV features of the Samsung TV... It works quite nicely. And I am raising my rating to a 3 even though it cost me extra money since I do enjoy their built in functions via a single remote.But I still need the LG SmartTV box for attaching my personal videos via USB. Many of of MKV and MP4 video files do not play using the Samsung USB interface. But those same video files work fine with the LG external USB box.Hopefully Samsung will update their video codecs in a future firmware release to be more compatible.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "very nice tv", "Author": "BC858", "ReviewID": "RVCSI83BXU12F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "picture looks great. thin and light. the bezels are very thin. was considering purchasing a vizio glad i choose samsung. very happy with purchase. no complaints.", "Date": "April 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not sure what to think, yet!!!!!", "Author": "John A.

Unfortunately I only had about a hour before leaving for work, but everything seemed fine.This morning it turned on fine and I attempted to use the E-manual, the menu came up, I selected one of the items and the screen went blue.  I was able to exit out, but was unable to access it again.I used my laptop to access the manual online from Samsung's website and then attempted to set up a favorites list of channels to view.  I marked the channels I didn't want to view in the guide and hit delete and the TV turned off (don't believe it was supposed to). It turned back on by itself and now it's stuck in a loop about every 10 seconds it turns itself on and off. Both Samsung remotes are inoperable and the only way to keep it off was by using my U-verse remote.  I tried the usual unplugging both the power cord and HDMI but as soon as I plugged the power cord back in it turned on stuck in the same loop again...Called Samsung support and after the usual unhelpful questions (Is the power cord loose) they gave me a reference # and told me someone would call within 24 hours to schedule a service call.  Just what I wanted to hear considering the TV is less than 24 hours old!!!!I'll update after service call!!Update:  No call within 24 hours, I called to check status the rep indicated the service center attempted to call, however not on my caller ID. Besides asking to verify my personal info no less than 15 times they were of no help to me..Final Update: It's been 5 days and I never received a call back from Samsung or authorized repair center.

The CEVA delivery service was fantastic, and better yet, the return process was super easy and the refund came about 3 days after the item was picked up.  I saved all the packing materials (I'm not really sure why, but it turned out to be a good move).Now to the TV . . . . First, as other reviewers have mentioned the picture is amazing.  The problem is the picture only looked amazing when the source was amazing (i.e. a Bluray player).  My DirecTV genie source (i.e. \"normal\" HD TV) wasn't so amazing.  It was almost like the TV didn't have the software capability to deal with a \"dumbed-down\" picture.  I turned off the the auto-motion hoping it would solve the problem, but it only makes things worse. I actually had my wife do a side-by-side comparison between this TV and our ancient sony XBR2 (52\"), and from the DirecTV source, she liked the Sony picture much better (and that TV is 8+ years old).  The picture almost studder's while watching things off the DirecTV source.  My initial thought was maybe our DirecTV source was just crappy, but DirecTV did some investigation and showed our signal strength/clarity weren't just good, they were fantastic.  Most of the picture issues disappeared when using a Blu-Ray source.  Actually, the picture was awesome.  Unfortunately, life doesn't revolve around a blu-ray player.  I contacted samsung to see if perhaps this was a firmware issue, and after getting the run-around, they basically told me to turn on auto-motion and everything would be better.  Gee.  Thanks.The wireless was just downright awful on the model I received.  I contacted Samsung to see if a firmware upgrade was in the works but I didn't get any kind of useful response.  As one other reviewer noted, I was actually told that the TV didn't have wireless at one point.  It took 22 hours+ to download the first firmware upgrade and the wireless router was in the same room.  Also, the wireless card won't support a WPA2 mixed security protocol (this took 3 hours to figure out), so you'll just have to go WPA2 (enterprise or personal).A 50ft Cat 5 cable later, I was able to get the SmartTV features working.  But that's when more software problems started occurring.  The TV would just turn off, and when it would come back on, it would be like it never had actually been turned on requiring it to be setup again.I stuck it out just over 3 weeks with the TV and then had enough when Amazon Instant Video just stopped working in mid-streaming.  It happened repeatedly.  As other reviewers have mentioned, this TV probably needs a software overhaul ASAP.

I was able to accept the 3D and Smart features just to be able to watch a tv with this kind of superior quality picture.The tv has a lot of extensive settings to control picture quality to suit a variety of tastes. I have read elsewhere that some folks have tweaked some of the picture settings, but my experience has been that the several picture quality presets provide optimal settings. I like the \"Dybamic\"  setting, but that is just me. I first watched Startrek (2009) Blu-ray on this Samsung and was BLOWN-A- WAY!!!! You just become riveted looking at details and effects that were not apparent in prior tv's. HDTV channels looked fabulous and non-Blu-ray disc movies up-converted extremely well to the point that I swore that I was watching a Blu-ray disc. I don't have a 3D Blu-ray player (yet), but switched on the 3D effect and paired the 3D glasses to the TV and was amazed at the 3D effect that was able to be achieved.Even though I had not originally made it a priority, I am enjoying the 3D and the SMART features! I really like that you can use voice commands to search the web, and have pulled up several Youtube videos. The processing speed is quite good, and have not had to wait for buffering. So far, I have not experienced any difficulty and am looking forward to using more of the Smart features.The native speakers/sound in the Samsung are marginally better than what most flat screen TV's come with, but I purchased a Sony HT-XT1 Sound Pedestal due to that fact that the TV is in my bedroom, and a 5.1 Surround system would be too much., and it had overall 4-5 star online reviews. The sound from the Sony HT-XT1 is REALLY GOOD, as I  set the bass to max (12). A nice benefit with the HT-XT1 is that it raises the he viewing height of the TV by 3 inches since the TV is sitting on top of the Sound Pedestal. This is appreciated as practically all LED LCD TV's come with hardly any vertical adjustment, and most tv's have too low of a viewing angle.Used a digital optical cable to hook up the sound. The sound quality fills the room and sounds great, with just enough bass to provide that theatre ambiance. Note: cranked-up, I did notice a buzz coming from the Samsung UN46H7150's support stand legs that vibrated the leg stand housing. I cut 1 and a half inch square black high-density 1/4 inch thick foam pieces, and put them between the 4 contact points of the Samsung legs and the top of the Sony Sound Pedestal, and no more buzz!As a product designer, I appreciate form, fit and functionality, and this Samsung UN46H7150 gets extremely high grades. The overall aesthetic look/styling is extremely refined, and the thin screen case with thin bezel looks very high-end. The leg support stand is a nice visual departure, although it could benefit (as mentioned previously) with a method to provide vertical height adjustability (at least 6 inches or more).The Samsung UN46H7150 came with 2 remotes, one is a more traditional full-sized, and the other smaller, with a light beam selector for quickly engaing the on screen Smart features. I really liked the smaller remote, especially with the light beam. That said, Samsung really needs to further optimize this remote with 2 upgrades:  1) integrate selectable backlighting for the buttons, and 2) replace the slippery plastic backside of the remote with a more grip rubber-like texture (right now, the little remote is just too slipperyand \"squirmy\" to handle. (I know a lot of customers want selectable back-lit remotes, as it is just annoying to have to turn on the house lights just to be able to see what you are trying to adjust....I know that I would pay the money to alleviate this annoyance).Summary:PROS:Absolutely STUNNING Picture Quality!Very High-End Look (Industrial Design)Nice Integration of Smart/3D featuresNearly Optimized Picture Mode PresetsCONSSmall Remote Needs (Selectable) Button Backlighting and a Better Rear Surface Grip .No Vertical Viewing Height Adjustability for ScreenBest to add a sound pedestal, soundbar or sound systemOverall, I am EXTREMELY excited with my purchase of the Samsung UN46H7150!  If anything, I have to try to make sure that I don't spend too much time now watching movies/programs on it, as the overall experience is just simply that good...you find yourself almost addicted...", "Date": "June 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Mine's defective :(", "Author": "migit", "ReviewID": "RAEJA7UU0BC39", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The TV is great, but there is one slight defect with mine.  My HDMI board is probably defective.  Samsung support so far has been wonderful though.  The customer support representative was awesome.  She didn't make me do a million things to try and prove to her over the phone that it was defective.  After I described the issue and my troubleshooting so far, she set me up with their service department and they're sending someone to my house to fix it free of charge.  It's unfortunate I got a defective TV, but I couldn't be happier with how they're handling the issue.  I'll update my review, up or down, depending on if/how the issue gets resolved.For the curious:The issue is that every once in a while (like, once or twice per hour) a single frame gets distorted with all sorts of wonky colors.  I've ruled out the cables (switched them out), my receiver (bypassed it), my XBOX (happens with the wii as well), the port on the TV (tested with 3 of the 4 ports on the TV) and the display itself (streaming from samsung apps doesn't cause the issue), so it seems likely the HDMI board is defective.", "Date": "June 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "love the tv!", "Author": "casey", "ReviewID": "R2HK0K64T0C9GQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "love the tv! great picture, easy to use and looks great on your wall if your going to mount it.  it does come with 2 remotes and the 2nd remote will kick you out of the smart hub when your trying to watch netflix or hulu", "Date": "May 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Buy for 3D content only", "Author": "Joshua D.", "ReviewID": "R397O3DGYJA643", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is what I was worried about.

There are some key ones you'll want to be aware of to get a good picture though and it depends on your setup of other things like cable box, dvd, etc.  Things like the Black Level setting Low or Normal depend on the input you're sending the signal from so don't judge the TV because of your whole setup.
