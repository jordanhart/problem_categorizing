{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Better than your ordinary TV!", "Author": "CMack", "ReviewID": "R35CQQVICRC9MB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is great! There are some mixed reviews out on the internet about this TV but the reality is, most TV's can not do what this TV can. There are some limitations to what the TV can do and some down side to the actual specifications of the TV but the positives out way the negatives by a lot. I will start with the negatives:The first major negative for me is that the TV is only 60 Hz. While this is lower than most TV's out there this size, you can hardly notice a difference. The second major negative is that the TV's processor is also a little weak and causes the TV to lag a little when loading an application. Because of the slower processor speed the TV is not very good for playing video games online but can still work fine for games in regular story mode (Offline). The third major negative about this TV is the fact that some websites block the TV from gaining access to their site. Most of the websites that do this are working on special deals or have already made deals with Sony or Google and only a few websites actually block the TV. The fourth negative for me was that fact that this TV uses an Audio Optical Cable out in order to hook up surround sound which meant I needed to buy a new receiver because my old one did not have an Audio Optical Cable IN.Now for the positive features of this product: The first major positive feature of this TV is the fact that it self updates, meaning every so often new software is available that makes it better or easier to use. As of right now each Google TV product should be running Android Honeycomb 3.1 or higher. With The newest software update you have full access to Apps, Widgets, and every feature Android tablets are capable of doing (Except a touch screen) all on your large screen TV. The second major positive feature is Internet access on its own or at the same time you're watching TV! There are not many other TV's on the market that have a full Internet browser! The third major positive feature is instant movie/TV show rentals/streaming on your TV. No longer do you need to watch Netflix, Amazon, or HBOGO movies (or any other streaming service) on your laptop/desktop or third party device like a PS3, you can just watch it on your TV. The fourth is HD upscale; this TV can upscale a picture or movie that is being displayed in a lower resolution to 1080, which is nice if you have a bunch of standard definition DVD's at home that you like to watch. Another cool feature that I have not tested out myself but have heard about is a TV web cam (If anyone has tried this please leave a comment bellow letting me know how it works.)Some of the other features about this TV worth mentioning are a universal remote that is functional and easy to use. Note: the mouse on the remote isn't the best but it's not the primary source of maneuvering around on this product. The TV also has multiple USB ports, remote streaming from your phone or computer and an application that turns your smart phone into a remote control! One of the coolest features I like about the TV is Google itself. I use a lot of the features Google offers online like, Google Drive, the calendar, and chat (have not tried video), along with Facebook/Google+ and other websites that I can access right on the TV. This is a Great TV and is worth checking out for yourself!*If you think you want to try the Google TV out but don't want to pay all the money for a new TV you might want to check out the Sony NSZ-GT1 Wi-Fi-Enabled 1080p Blu-ray Disc Player Featuring Google TV! Its a blu-ray and all of the features of the TV in a nice looking box that cost around $200.00. I Also have one of these hooked up to a Samsung plasma in my living room and it rocks! Google TV is now available on LG's new LED TV. LG offers a updated processor and faster refresh rate, making it a much faster, thinner TV worth looking at!", "Date": "February 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent device, with a few flaws...", "Author": "johnnycab", "ReviewID": "R386GI1IMMFE3I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted a TV for gaming and video-on-demand (particularly Amazon). I haven't had cable TV in years and get all my media from the internet, so the idea of having a non-internet-connected TV seemed ludicrous.When I began researching TVs I was astonished to find there are basically no televisions that have WiFi and full internet connectivity. And even the XBox 360 I'm buying is crippled by Microsoft so that web browsing is difficult or impossible.I really like the form-factor of the remote. I considered the Logitech GoogleTV offering but their mini-keyboard approach seemed inferior compared to Sony's game-controller-style remote. My major problem at the moment is the optical trackpad / thumbpad DOES NOT WORK! When I click it the cursor appears, and occasionally it will respond and move across the screen, but 9 times out of 10 it is completely unresponsive. All the other keys work flawlessly so it doesn't seem to be a signal problem. Perhaps the remote is defective, but I sure don't want to return this TV just to get a functioning remote. Current workaround is plugging in a wireless USB mouse which works perfectly but is inconvenient.Setup was easy; however, the mounting brackets on the TV did not slide fully onto the stand, preventing me from putting in the mounting screws. No amount of force/jiggling would allow it to slide fully on, but it's on well enough to stay.Documentation is sparse and I had to search the web to figure out how to add/delete bookmarks and the like. Still if you can get around an Android phone you should have no problem with this TV; it is essentially an Android device with a very large screen and a custom UI.I would say if you have a decent TV already, go with the Logitech box (or the Sony one if you happen to want a BluRay player). But if you're upgrading to a new screen and are happy with the 40\" (or 46\") screen size this unit is a good way to go. Part of the reason I didn't want a separate box is that I expect Android/GoogleTV will be built into most televisions within a couple of years...if consumers get to choose between a dumb standalone box or a WiFi-connected fully internet-ready device, which do you think they'll pick?", "Date": "March 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Input lag, read update at bottom (Will not work with PS3, XBOX360, Wii)", "Author": "D. Maxon", "ReviewID": "R3EM5A8XWMVYMO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I spent a long time shopping for a new TV and turned down a bunch because I wanted something cheaper. Once I saw everything Google TV had to offer, I ended up deciding to spend more.Picture: I have seen some complaints about the picture quality but have not had the same feelings myself. I am in love with audio and good sound, an audiophile, but not a big \"Nice picture\" kinda guy. That being said the picture quality seems awesome. Watching Planet Earth in 1080 was amazing and Disney animated movies (Like Toy Story, Shrek) look fantastic. My daughter is mesmerized with the picture on these movies. As I am sure a lot of you are aware of, the picture quality of a Blu-ray depends a lot on the movie itself so there are some movies (Like Napoleon Dynamite) that do not look the best and leave you feeling ripped off if you paid too much. I like to use Toy Story 2 as a good test of picture quality because it is not made to have that \"fuzzy\" theater look and is very colorful. Toy Story 2 looks AMAZING! The one complaint that I think has a little merit is the depth of the blacks in films. But it is such a minor problem that I have to point it out to people to make them notice. Maybe \"problem\" wouldn't even be the right word, it just could be better. Its not like this TV is made with an AMOLED screen, the blacks are back-lit and therefore not perfectly dark.Hardware: The TV itself seems built pretty well. Along with the HDMI jacks there is an optical audio out that makes me very happy. Unlike my last Sony TV, this set turns the built in speakers off when external audio is connected. On top of that the software allows you to disable the TV sound altogether (When you press volume on the TV it says its disabled) and that is perfect for me because I have a great home theater setup and feel the TV speakers are useless (For me, an amateur audiophile) The included stand on the TV could be better, but its nice and sturdy and gets the job done.Software and Google TV: This was the strong point and weak point for me.  First of all having Google TV built in is a very useful and impressive feature. The other options for Google TV require external devices that just can't do what a built in version can. My wife and I love being able to access our TV applications and channel line-up and still have the show we were watching in the corner. The applications allow you to watch Netflix and more and includes Google Chrome for web browsing. The web browsing is just about as good and fast as my home PC. The people that complained about the speed must have been using wireless. Since I stream a lot of movies it is important for me to be able to connect my Ethernet cable right to the TV. The built in processor (1.6 GHz Atom) seems to be able to handle web browsing without breaking a sweat.The downside for the Google TV is the lack of an Android market (For those of you that don't know, Google TV runs on Android). It seems there is so much more that this TV is capable of that it doesn't do. For this reason and this reason alone I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.Google makes the promise that the Android market will be available for this TV this year (2011) and if it was any company other than Google, I would have waited. But Google is usually pretty good about following through with their plans so I took the leap and purchased this TV even with this problem. Once they open the Android market I foresee a lot of possibilities opening up.Don't let me down Google!***Update6.13***I don't play much video games and don't own any consoles but found that after connecting my computer to the TV there was an input lag (Also a lag with Wii, PS3, XBOX360, Etc). I wanted to play one of my first person shooters on the TV instead of my monitor. I found there was enough of an input lag to get in the way. I contacted Sony about this and got this response:Spencer_ > Users may experience a slight lag or delay in response time when connecting the Internet TV device to a game console.Spencer_ > This is a natural result of the advanced processing circuitry in the Internet TV device.Spencer_ > This is normal operation.Advanced processing makes my TV have a lag? More like poor design. They could have at least apologized and said they were working to fix it. This TV has been great otherwise, but this is a joke and their poor response, unwillingness to try to fix it, and lack of information about the input lag before buying this TV makes them go from 4 stars to 1.Shame on Sony.", "Date": "April 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "you put your tv in my computer...your computer is in my tv", "Author": "Animals R Friends", "ReviewID": "RYQ4YPJRT6H0X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have been waiting years for just the right tv. I bought this sony googletv to replace my 20\" sony tube tv (yep you heard me right 20\") that I bought 14 years ago and was still going strong. So I dont have much to compare with as far as picture quality or sound or internet. I was blown away by the picture (when I finally got it hooked up) and the sound is nothing short of amazing when hooked up through my receiver. I actually heard lines in movies I have never heard before. Only complaint you cant watch hulu or some online shows through the network website. Closed Caption does not work through tv must set up with your cable box instead. Love the picture in picture.

In my case, I bought the TV for a master bedroom. I purchased the 40\" model because it would insure enough room to be able to watch TV and work on the internet at the same time. This is a very important issue, especially for someone with limited mobility. Before, my wife used her laptop for internet access and a 32\" TV on the wall to watch satellite TV. Having both on the same screen actually makes the experience a lot easier for her.Picture Quality -- We have a large (55\") Samsung TV that allows 1080p viewing in the living room, so I knew that some screens would simply be too big for a bedroom. When it comes to HDTV, being bigger is not necessarily better. It has to do with viewing angles and what the eye can see given the context and position of the screen. We had also been using a Sceptre 32\" HDTV in the bedroom, but it was only capable of 720i viewing.When I got the new Sony running I was amazed at just how clear the picture is. I knew Sony made good TVs, so I had expected some improvement. But it was easily 3x better than the Sceptre 32 at 720i resolution. In fact, it was significantly better quality than my 3 year old Samsung 55\" at 1080. We watch a lot of Netflix, especially older TV shows, and they even come through really well.Amazon recommends that you have a 40\" screen when viewing from 10 feet or more away. Our bedroom is about 15 x 15, so we are easily 10 feet away from the screen. That meant that the 32\" Sceptre was below the minimum recommended for HDTV, and this may account for some of the quality difference. But it is not enough to make up that big difference I am seeing. I attribute that to this being a really good TV.Sound Quality -- I know the TV manufacturers and retailers will claim they put these anemic speakers in their TVs because \"most people use home theater systems.\" Frankly, that's a lot of Bologna! If you're paying $800 for a TV you should get sound quality better than my 50 year old transistor radio playing an AM talk station gets. With that pet-peeve out of the way, let me say the sound quality is only fair to good. You can probably get by with it if you are only watching older TV shows. But if you like movies or anything that will have a need for good sound quality you will have to spend the extra money to buy a soundbar or home theater system.I initially invested in an RCA Home Theater system with Blu-Ray player, and the sound was great. After about 2 hours, though, the Blu-Ray player started making a noise, and when I took it back to the store I was told that model had a long history of noise problems. I have not replaced the system, yet, and hope to do so next week. I'm sure some sort of soundbar or theater system will be a welcome addition to the setup.Google TV -- This system uses Google and provides access to the Android Market. I use a Droid X for a phone, which also means I can control my TV with the Droid. More importantly, I can get the same games and other software on my TV now. Better still, I can access my Gmail account easily and control my calendar system from the TV. This is pretty cool. You also use Chrome for the net browser. If you're not a Chrome user then it will take some getting used to. I hated Chrome for the first week or so I used it, and still have not gotten used to the oddities that make it so much different from Firefox or Internet Explorer. I have to say, though, that my net sessions don't crash as often using Chrome on my computer, and now that I have it on my TV as well I think I'm slowly becoming a Chrome fan.Netlix -- In my mind this might be the biggest selling point of the Google TV system. Recently Netflix went to a dual pay system where you can buy the DVD package, streaming package, or the combination. I use the combination, so I have access to all of their DVD library. The streaming package is the real advantage, though, when it comes to the TV side of things. The greatest part is there are NO commercials, and you don't have to fast forward through them like you do when using a DVR. I'm sure Netflix will expand their library, and there are some \"old\" shows that I'd like to see on the streaming (such as Newhart, Taxi, etc.), but all in all this is a wonderful feature.Switching from live TV to Netflix is really simple as well. With my living room system, I have to turn on the PS3, login, connect to Netflix, and then I get to watch the streaming stuff. If I want to jump back and forth between streaming and live TV it can take several minutes, 2 remotes, and is generally a pain. With this system, though, the switch is as simple as hitting the \"Home\" button the Sony remote and then selecting Netflix. Going back to live TV is even easier. Add to this the DirecTV DVR and you can pretty much always find something to watch. And if you can't, then there is always the other options on Google TV.Other Options Like Qriocity and Youtube -- I have not used the Qriocity system yet. It is a pay-per-view type of system, and I've simply not had the time or inclination to check it out.As for Youtube, I never used it much on the computer. But now on the 40\" TV screen I find myself drawn to it for some reason. Just something about watching some dunderhead skate board kid crashing onto a handrail guarantee he won't breed that is sort of fun. Surprisingly, there are some pretty decent things on Youtube as well. I play guitar and I've been using some of the homemade and a few of the commercial guitar videos to help me learn different riffs and techniques.As the entertainment choices expand on this system I can see that it will be a great purchase. My only fear is greed! If Sony decides that their Qriocity system is not making enough money they may \"update\" my system so that I'm limited on the types of things I can access. For right now, though, I have access through the home network to the Internet, and there's plenty of reasonably priced options for my entertainment. I could even see a fellow dumping all of the satellite and their high-priced pay-per-view stuff in favor of the online servers. Drop your cable or satellite service, which often costs $100/month or more for multi-room access, and put the money instead into services like Netflix and Qriocity. But then, I'm guessing the folks at Sony already had that figured out when they put this TV on the market.", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "excellent tv", "Author": "har", "ReviewID": "RP3AHBDHWHTZ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is beautiful, the picture is great and the sound is wonderful if you are watching and listening to in a normal way.  It does so much that I am sure you will never be able to use it at its 100% capacity.

The remote is great; you do have to use both hands but which other remote has QWERTY in it?Overall this is a great TV, first round for SONY/GOOGLE they do upgrade the software which did make a difference in my case.  I would recommend this to someone looking for a one stop TV, obviously if you are looking for the top of the top, you would not get it all in one unit therefore do not try to compare a TV with a surround sound system a PC and a TV tuner altogether.This TV is great for everything you would need the TV to do which is to watch TV!

My Son is an avid XBOX 360 gamer, so I figured, no problem, this is basically a computer within a TV, so it should be fast enough to meet my Son's needs, plus it is such a cool looking TV and he was enamored with it's appearance (he is very particular).He and I were both excited and we quickly set it up and he started playing.  That's when the trouble started.  Within 5 minutes he was complaining about input lag.  What is that?  Well it is a delay imposed by the TV on rendering frames and it causes the responsiveness of the game to be unusable for 3rd person shooters.  He was devastated, the cool TV that he wanted so much was not usable.So, back to the store it went and we had to go buy a less desirable looking unit that was fast enough for his gaming.Sony, what are you thinking?  Come on.  This unit should be fast enough as it has a computer in it.  Even Sony admits on their eSupport web site that this may be an issue.  Shame on you Sony for creating a great looking easy to use product that kids can't play games on.Buyer be ware.  If you are buing this for a child who plays video games.

As a net surfer it's kinda bad actually-not that many apps and no google market place as has been promised for some time-not a great picture quality compared to cheaper LED models with it's slow refresh rate and generally poor picture (but the average person won't really care and will think it's ok)All in all, it's not bad but it isn't great or even really good yet.  The reality is it's not very user friendly unless you are a first gen. adopter type of person.  I don't mind it but \"Mom\" will typically hate it.  As a computer, it is crippled heavily by the worst thumb track pad in the entire world.  It's so bad that I think I might actually have a broken unit.  If the track pad worked well it wouldn't be too bad really.  Clicking on a link can take several drunk swipes and usually leads to frustration.  It's a mediocre tv, a mediocre computer, and all at a very high price.  I would suggest, for the price, buying a cheap LED tv and an Ipad or other cheaper tablet device until this whole internet TV thing catches up to modern technology.  As it is now, it's kinda like going to a fast food restaurant and paying fine dining prices.  Sure, the food is decent and it fills you up but it's really expensive and it still tastes like fast food.So why am I keeping it?  Frankly, when it works, it's pretty cool and the way I hope technology will continue to go.  Also, I got it half off because I know someone otherwise I would never have bought it at full price or even 25% off.  It's almost ready for prime time but not at MSRP or even close.  And yet, I still gave it four stars.  Go figure.  It is cool though.

I dutifully clicked OK and waited... and waited.  Nothing.  The TV froze and would only show the SONY logo in white taunting me.  I called Sony tech service.  After a lengthy series of what amounted to \"kick the tires\" the rep gave up and said I needed to talk to a technical expert.  She said they would call me on Monday morning as they don't work weekends. I grumbled and waited and waited.  About 2:00 I called to find they had no intention of calling me.  And, by the way, you don't really need to talk to a technician.  They can't fix this over the phone.  To me, that says that this is a VERY COMMON PROBLEM.  Why I had to wait three days to find this out, I'll never know.  I asked the \"customer service\" rep what I was supposed to do with my 4 yr old twins that I'd promised to watch a movie that past weekend AND SHE HUNG UP ON ME!  Sony refused a refund.  They did offer me a refurbished TV and another wait of a week of more AND I had to give them my credit card information again.  Really?! My TV was only 2 months old and they want to give me potentially a much older and also previously non-working TV as compensation for my troubles? I asked for a refund or a new one.. no go.

We have broadcast TV and Netflix only, so we do watch some programs on the internet.  In the end we finally decided to spring for a Sony google TV.  Sony NSX-40GT1We are very happy with our choice.  Several of our favorite channels are now available on it, including MSNBC and Comedy Central.  It has 4 HDMI inputs, which is nice for people with lots of toys.  We use one for a DVD player and one for a brite-view Air-Sync HD which feeds it from the Tivo in the next room.

I'm waiting for a compatible remote that I like better.  We also have an Android phone configured to control it and the mouse is easier to use on the phone.My only other complaint is the screen is very reflective.  We have windows in the room with no curtains and lots of reflections on the screen.  The TV previously in this room was an analog TV so since those screens are not shiny and not even flat, reflections were never a problem. Our other digital TVs do not have such shiny screens.

Internet  build in on this Tv is plus feature, if you got bore watching TV just switch to internet and no need to get up and turn on that bulky computer and the best part is that it will work with Iphone or Sony smart phone as additional remote.The good: Good clear & sharp picture quality @60hz, Internet build in with N card also work with 5.8hz router, plenty of hdmi input, menu driven are straight forward, nice LED that lit up SONY logo in the front :) which can be turn off, additional remote can be conjunction with Iphone. I did not have any issues connecting @5.8hz also the atom 1.6ghz is plenty muscle for browsing the web. Nice fit in your hand remote control but little confusing at first but yes there is always manual for everything.The bad: Google chrome does not work with few website due to plug-in incompatibility, once in awhile during internet browsing I will get an error with the browser complaint about the plug-in but hey what the heck...we get this all the time using IE, Mozilla & so forth on the computer and top of it all we have to worry about getting spyware malware or virus, this you don't.Overall I think it a great TV, Amazon price is still higher than worst buy even after tax & free shipping.

Those are my primary uses for the TV..The one problem I seem to be having now though is streaming movies from my PC.  I can stream movies to my tablet, phone, ps3, but my Google TV will stream them and then stop playing the movie after about 10 mins, some times it even skips to another movie.

And this didn't use to be an issue, I also don't think it's an issue with the wireless connection on the TV because it plays YouTube and Netflix without any hiccups (mostly).I'm considering running an Ethernet cable to it just to make sure that doesn't fix the issue, but haven't found the time yet...

This was the main reason I decided to take a chance with the Google TV.  But after owning it about 10 days I took it back to Best Buy.  Honestly I don't think this is ready yet.  I know that it's currently got Android 2.1 as it's OS, so maybe when they update to a later version of Android \"This Summer\" it will make things more fluid...It just seems to lag a bit between switching from Live TV to Netflix, Media Player, or even just pulling up the Menu..Another Problem I personally had was I could never get my Program Guide to populate.  I have Comcast and had this TV in my bedroom just connected with the coax (No Receiver).  I've read where other people had the same issue and i tried Deleting the Profile as suggested SEVERAL times, i even tried nearby zip codes, even Factory Restoring (nothing ever worked)Also this TV's picture is definitely not up to par with other LED's..But the Main Deal Breaker for me was i noticed it had a dead pixel..  You could see it anytime there was a dark scene.  There was 1 Green Dot lit up.Overall, I think this has definite potential to be pretty cool.. That is if the update can tweak and fix a lot of issues..  I'm really hoping that the processor that Sony went with is enough to pull off all they're trying to with this TV though...But as it is now I don't recommend this product..", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Can't hook my PC into the TV!!!", "Author": "chipmalee \"chipmalee\"", "ReviewID": "RG7IZ8AHAC7EW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "MAJOR FLAW...there's no VGA input.  All other Sony models have VGA.  Sony really missed the boat on this one, otherwise, this would have been a \"keeper\".PROs:1.  The picture is phenomenal.  It's big and crystal clear, almost what you expect a Sony to be.  I refuse to pay for cable so I got a coat hanger TV antenna and it works perfectly with a pre-amp (google COAT HANGER ANTENNA on YouTube).  Gets CBS, NBC, PBS and several UHF (Fox, ION, CW, WB) but does not get ABC.2.  Google TV fires up instantaneous if you have an active WiFi.  See my comments about waking up to it.3.  The TV PIP is larger than usual so you won't miss the smaller details on TV while browsing the web on full screen plus there's also an option to increase or decrease the PIP size with the keypad.CONs:1.  There's no VGA connection.  I brought it hoping to hook my PC to the TV so I can do work at the same time monitoring what's on TV.  Google TV is not for working.  There's no place to copy and paste.  You are basically like browsing a magazine at the dentist's office. WORKAROUND: Buy a new computer with HDMI but that's spending extra money so not that great of an idea. Don't try a VGA to HDMI converter...researched it and doesn't work too good.2.  The keypad is not easy like a TV Remote.  I miss those easily accessible features like \"last channel\" and sleep.  You have to hit several keys to get there but I haven't figured a work around yet.  And that's how unfriendly the keypad is.  Especially in the dark, it's hard to type in those HD subchannels like \"12.1\". WORKAROUND: Bookmark the channel. To get back you have to click \"Home\" and cursor to the bookmarked channel, \"Enter\".  That's at least 2 steps...not as easy as a \"last channel\"3.  The built-in On Air broadcast TV Guide doesn't work.  It's blank, thus worthless.  I've researched and worked on it for more than 8 hours.  Still no data.  So I bookmark Zap2It.com to view my TV schedules. WORKAROUND: There's a \"What's On\" app when in home menu. App will only give you the title of show and minutes left. Stick with Zap2It, set up an account, and keep the cookies on.4.  There's no dual tuner so you can view several channels at once.5.  There's no reset button.  Google TV locked up or crashed on me couple of times.  Only needed to unplug the unit once to reboot.6.  Google TV needs Google account to sync and TV voice command (option turned on) tells me every time it syncs.  But I don't know what Google is syncing.  Is it syncing my web surfing activities?  Can't find any info.7.  NEW! USB ports doesn't play most videos. Plugged flash and tried playing AVI, WMA, FLV...can't find files. Specs says Sony will play MPEG4 but only had MPEG so plugged that in and only got sound...black screen.Comments:  There's nothing like waking up in the morning and click on the Sony without turning on my PC and checking on the weather because I have leached onto my neighbor's unsecured WiFi.  There's no wait for a PC to warm up.  I like to say, life is almost worth living...if only I can hook up my PC to it.  I'm returning this TV in hopes that the Samsung or Panasonic Smart TVs will have VGA input.UPDATE:  Added \"WORKAROUND\" comments to help consumers hack Sony's missing features.I've returned the Sony and now trying out a LG. Even though I only gave Sony 3 stars, I am going to give LG 2 stars because it's even harder to work with. More to follow. The CrunchyRoll app which gets Asian TV shows and movies on Sony Google TV will not let you watch it unless you pay for premium membership.  However on the LG Smart TV, it's FREE.

I figured with the so called advanced processing circuitry and the fact that it was specifically designed to access and display web based media that it would be the clear choice for my needs...WRONG! From the second I hooked it up to my computer (it's running a six core processor, 8Gb of ram and a Nvidia GTX 570. I just listed that so you wouldn't thing it is my computers fault) there was an immediate and unfathomable amount of input lag from what the mouse was doing compared to what the cursor on the screen was doing. The input lag was so bad that it made it even hard to try to open a desktop icon because I kept passing them up. I checked and rechecked everything and found everything to be set up and connected perfectly. I then tried the PS3 and found it had the same issue making any game I tried virtually unplayable. I decided to browse the forums looking for NSX-40GT lag and found this to be a HUGE and documented issue with this TV. I thought how does Sony put out a TV that you can't even use with their own product, the PS3. Disgusted, I contacted Sony and spoke to three different drones over the course of an hour that kept repeating the same thing...\"Users may experience a slight lag or delay in response time when connecting the Internet TV device to a game console. This is a natural result of the advanced processing circuitry in the Internet TV device. This is normal operation.\"...Lag is \"NORMAL OPPERATION\"?! and they call it 'advanced circuitry\"...wow.

(i heard so many theories online and was concerned) he said it was discontinued because in the end on March they will be coming out with a newer model with much better feautres(actually thats now at time im writing this) Im cant image how they can get MUCH better. this thing is so awesome.So quick rundown about the negative review that worried me...the REMOTE? fantastic! yes it looks different, this tv has redefined everything you can do with a TV. All that THIS TV  does cannot be done with a standard remote.  its amazing it all fits in roughly the same size remote (square inch wise i mean, it is a bit more square than most) It works like a touch screen although there no \"screen\" on the remote.. you just slide your thumb or finger over the direction pad and the courser moves on the screen! ive never seen anything like it before? yeah you can use the pad buttons most of the time if you prefer but it is so naturalk felling to use the touch sensor you wont use it any other way.

THEN it asked my zip code, then it supplied a video feed and channel number info for a few test stations and asked if they were the same stations that appeared on the list that Comcast says (like is channel 3ABC and is channel 421 HSN ect) after that it is complete?BROWSER? it hasnt failed me yet ANYWHERE? social networking, XXX content (including videos) just for test purposes of course lol, online picture sharing galleries, my fathers personally hosted websites, what else.... um i dont know like i said i have not EVER had a issue reaching a site.. ill update here it that changes. i HAVE heard of restrictions to 3 (1,2,3) websites and they are all news sites (i have heard) that supposedly block videos being viewd? but there are so many news site you CAN see? and PLEASE DONT EVER FORGET this IS a tv? you can tune in to the REAL news anytime you want even PIP it while your browsing?UPDATES?

I do love the free pandora app and the classy fireplace that crackles away in the background! and the media player and the netflix!I dont know what else to say those were the biggest features that concerned me after my impulse buy. this thing is a amazing piece of hardware you cannot be disappointed. it doesn't make coffee or go to work for you? im sure there will be some critisisim for that? ill update this if i have issues its been about 1 moth now and this thins is WAY more that just a conversational piece! I love it!...oh thats right i forgot to mention (some here criticized me for not saying)if you want to use the remote for your cable box to there is a small cable (called a IR blaster cable and it is shipped with the tv. it has a plug like a headphone jack) that needs to be plugged in the back and has a sensor on it with a piece of self adhesive tape (the hole piece is about the size of a 5 cent coin) it can be stuck on the back of your tv with just the tiny led like bulb protruding for reception. the hole installation took me 2 minutes, and only that long cuz i wanted to decide where to stick it?

It's definitely a great market for consumers.What I thought I wanted out of a TV was this: a device running on a flexible and future-facing platform that leverages the best of internet video, apps (that I would actually want on a TV like Netflix, IMDb, etc.), and old-fashioned television. The Google TV seemed like the obvious choice.Unfortunately, it's not quite there yet. I've now used this TV for over a month and I am looking to get rid of it. I wanted to like this TV because it had so much potential. If it's helpful in making your decision, below are the reasons why I wish I wouldn't have purchased it. Also, you should know that I have the latest software on it (Honeycomb), in case you were thinking that update might fix some of this. Sadly, it doesn't. = )The Remote- The remote looks cool, but using it is entirely frustrating. I'm sure there's a logic as to when to use the trackpad wheel on the right, and when to use the nav wheel on the left, but it's certainly not intuitive. The buttons are easy to accidentally press because they are small and several. It's easy to bump the remote, and that causes a mouse cursor to jump onto the screen which doesn't disappear for about 30 seconds. I ended up downloading the Google TV remote for my iPhone and just sitting the physical remote aside.Android Doesn't Seem Ready for TV- The OS the TV is running is Google's Android and it is very exposed. The TV runs apps, and when they need an update a notification pops up on your screen every few hours (even if you are watching something). Sometimes the updates don't work and it just continues to notify you. I've been trying to update the NBA app (which came installed on the TV and can't be removed), for weeks, in order to get rid of the notification pop up. When I try to update, it gives me an error message saying the operation failed and to try again later. Another fun OS error occurs when I try to use the Google TV Remote app for my iPhone to control the TV. If my iPhone is dormant too long, it generates a large error message on the TV screen that pretty much blocks the middle of the screen (and whatever you were watching). The error says the connection failed. When you select OK, which you can only do by finding the physical remote and using the annoying tiny trackpad, it gives you another error indicating the Remote Control app failed. At this point you've lost your focus on whatever you were watching. There's something very annoying and unnatural about the error messages and notifications popping up in the middle of my movies that served as the final straw for me.No Hulu- There's no Hulu Plus app for Google TV and there's actually no way to view Hulu on Google TV. It just gives you a message indicating that it's coming soon (as it has been for months and months and months). Every other Sony TV with Internet connectivity currently being sold offers Hulu Plus. I never realized how much I liked having Hulu on my TV until I couldn't get it.YouTube Doesn't Work Sometimes- When you try to watch a YouTube video it prompts a box asking if you want to watch it in the browser or on the YouTube app. I honestly feel it would be nicer if it just chose one or let you set a default to limit complexity (maybe there's a setting I haven't discovered). After a few videos viewed in the browser, YouTube just stops working in the browser until you kill the browser app and reopen it. Sometimes the same thing happens in the YouTube app. It's very hit or miss.Very Few Apps- Google TV advertising boasts several apps, but there are only a handful of apps actually designed for the Google TV. Most the apps offered appear to be designed for Android tablets. Some of the tablet apps work out OK, but Google clearly hasn't built a strategy for how to limit dysfunctional features by device yet. For example, some apps offer errors when they can't access features like vibration or screen brightness, etc. One app was unable to use the TV's internet connection so it didn't work. This is disappointing because they are offered in the app marketplace on the TV. You would assume that the majority of features would be functional on the TV if they are offered on the TV's store. Unfortunately, that's not always the case. So they kind of work... but not really. To be fair, you really don't want every Android app on your TV; only a few are relevant (like Flixster, Netflix, IMDb, etc). It's just annoying that Google isn't moderating the content well.Searching is Confusing- You would assume that Google would do search well on Google TV, but it's not quite there yet either. If you hit the search button on the remote from within Netflix, for example, you would assume you are searching Netflix. Instead, you are searching the entire OS, all videos on all apps and services (like your cable or satellite). I hope Google offers developers an API (or perhaps they already do and nobody uses it) which allows the option to narrow search to within an app with the hardware search button in a future update. If the search functionality worked intuitively, it would be very useful.Settings... a Nightmare- Because the TV (even the hardware) thinks of itself as an Android Device... like, literally thinks of itself as a giant tablet, all of the hardware settings are in the Android settings app. It's sometimes tough to know what's a function of the OS and what's a function of the hardware. That makes it difficult to find the right settings. It also seems that some of the settings you would expect on a TV are just absent.The Hardware is Cheap- I don't want to hark on this too much considering the price point of this TV, but the hardware is really cheap. It's also pretty poorly designed for wall-mounting. For instance, the speakers are on the back. If you mount the TV, the volume sounds muffled, but your neighbors will likely complain since it's reverberating through the walls. Another annoying hardware element is that, by default, the Sony logo on the front glows a brilliant white whenever the TV is on. It's pretty difficult to navigate the Android system settings to find the option to turn that off. Trust me though, you'll want to turn it off right away. The light is very distracting with movies. Lastly on the hardware front, the low refresh rate results in ghosting. It's most evident on games.I waited for the first major revamp, hopeful that Google TV would finally be a perfect fit at this price, but discovered it's not. I wouldn't recommend this TV unless you really need a browser on your TV; the fully-functional Chrome browser is it's only real strong point. I gave it several weeks thinking I would eventually fall in love with it once I learned to use it better or once I found it's \"killer app\" or \"killer feature.\" Turns out it just doesn't have one.I hope these experiences I've shared help you make a well-informed decision. If you really want to tinker with Google TV (and I'd posit that tinkering is all it's really good for at this point), you may want to consider the less expensive Logitech Revue connected to a different TV:Logitech Revue Companion Box with Google TV and Keyboard Controller.If you are just looking for a good way to get Netflix, Hulu, Pandora, and some other key content on your existing TV, I'd consider a Roku. It's got dozens of apps/channels to bring web content to your TV at a very reasonable price: Roku LT Streaming Player. There are some differences between models though, so read carefully before buying.If you have an iPhone, iPad, or Mac (and don't mind not having Hulu), you are better off with an Apple TV. They are fairly inexpensive and work well with your other Apple products. They allow you to do things like push YouTube videos you start on your iPhone to your Apple TV, access iTunes Match, shop the iTunes store, stream your music from your computer, etc. Apple TV also has an incredibly well-designed interface built around simplicity (something Google should really consider), and intuitive navigation: Apple TV  MC572LL/A  (NEWEST VERSION).If you are interested in what I have my eye on to replace this Google TV, I'm considering a Panasonic Plasma model with VieraCAST. It has all the web apps and YouTube you could want. it also has a video adapter for Skype that allows you to create 3D video (imagine sitting around the TV on Christmas morning while it takes all the video for you in 3D). Plus it has dozens of apps including Netflix, Pandora, Skype, Hulu, YouTube, 3D, etc: Panasonic VIERA TC-P46ST30 46-Inch 1080p 600 Hz 3D Plasma HDTV. Some of the Samsung Smart TVs also look pretty amazing.Thanks for reading, hope it helped, and I hope you enjoy whatever you ultimately decide on!", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Impressive TV, but read the reviews so you know what you're in for!", "Author": "MarkOTheBigO", "ReviewID": "R2BPCMH90036X8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV is used in our bedroom. I got this TV in September for my wife, to replace our old 22\" tube TV. I waited a couple months for us to use the TV before writing this review. We are in our early 50's.Pros:Even when it's off, this TV looks great - very sleek and clean, back side is white.All printed documentation that comes with the unit is in English only. No multi-language excess garbage.Way more features and frills than we'll use today, but we'll be able to explore and make better use of these as time goes on. For now, it's just a TV and Netflix for us! And it's a Sony.Cons:1. Shipping box is the original Sony box...ie, no added protection. This is totally inadequate for this TV. The box had a 1 inch puncture in the middle of the bottom, with some scratches on the unit on the underside.2. Where's the User Manual? Just a Quick Setup Guide (10 pages, generic for all 4 of the NSX models), a single sheet about unpack aging & installing the stand, a sheet on tip over cautions, a 12 page reference guide, and a 50 page EULA book (totally useless) that's as thick as what a User Manual should be.3. Took a long time to get the remote to sync up. Instructions do not say about how long it takes, neither does the on screen menus. After 40 minutes of changing batteries, moving around, trying different buttons, turning off the lights and other TV/stereo stuff, etc. I finally took another (actually about the 5th time) look at the quick reference set up troubleshooting. It says if the remote don't sync, get closer to the TV. Well I did that before, but this time I got about 1 foot away from the sensor on the TV and it worked. Jeez that's weird, what good could this remote be if you have to be a foot away? Well apparently this is only for setup; after setup in normal use the remote works anywhere in the room with no problem.4. Could not get the wireless working at setup, waited and waited and the on screen display just did its `searching' without giving any status update. Instructions say it could take 15 minutes, so if it doesn't work after 15 minutes with no status update what do you do? Try something else, and wait 15 minutes again...and again...and again. Finally I used a wired connection, but that did not work the first time either. After power down and up again, it finally found itself and was able to continue with the setup.5. The setup process FORCES you to have a Google email account. Note: Not just any Google account - specifically a Google EMAIL account; and if you do not already have one, you are REQUIRED to create a Google email account before it will even allow you to continue the setup! What kind of crap is this?!6. After getting a football game on, I put this Sony next to my 2-yr old Toshiba 37 inch 37HVL66 LCD TV for comparison...uh-oh. Did not look nearly as good as the Toshiba - the Sony had dim, dull colors. Had to change to `Vivid' picture and then it was much better (comparable to the Toshiba). Then I did some more changes with brightness, contrast, color, etc and finally got it set a little better to my liking - and looking slightly better than the Toshiba.7. The remote - mixed feelings on this one, buttons too small. Intuitive? Not for me, and no way for my wife. But we can turn it on/off, find TV channels, and watch Netflix.8. My 17 year old son tried his xbox360 and yes the \u00bd second time lag makes this unusable. But I knew about this, and was ok with the tradeoffs before I bought it. I actually now have even more second thoughts on this, since someday this TV will be the 'old' TV, and then it goes to the basement rec room...and then more likely to be used for gaming!9. When set to the `power save' mode, it will take ~40 seconds for the TV to come up when you turn it on. We got used to it, this is sort of nostalgic actually...just like the TV's from the 60's! Not a big deal really.So I was going to return this TV before the free 30-day trial period was up, just because the TV was pretty expensive and complicated and had minor shipping damage etc. Costco had good prices on smart/internet TV's at the time, and they included 2 year warranty's. But my wife grew to liking this TV, and all its other fancy features that she has no idea how to use, so she wanted to keep it. I also think she was a bit giddy that I surprised her with an expensive TV, just because I said she needed a good one - And not for her birthday or xmas or anniversary, but just because she's worth it.

My review is based on the fact that as a smart TV it simply fails.The layout for Netflix is actually very limiting, so when browsing for movies they only show you a handful of selections. So you can use pretty much any other internet access to Netflix to get a real understanding of what movies are available and then search Netflix on your Sony Tv to find them. Apple TV and Samsung Smart TVs both have a much better design.The worst aspect is that HBO GO app is just a link to Google Chrome. Literally no user interface effort put into the HBO GO app in over 2 years and the streaming is spotty at best. Renting movies is also a process and never easy. Sometimes I can rent movies from YouTube and sometimes I can only pay to rent a movie, but can't watch it. Amazon renting doesn't always work either. Surprisingly, if the Sony movie rental place has the movie you want, it works.I just spent a weekend with a Samsung Smart TV to realize how terrible Sony and Google have been married. It is almost like Google and Sony put together a half-assed product, and in their failure decided never to improve it.

BUT, you CANNOT use the Pandora app anymore, I have to go to Google Chrome and pandora.com to login to listen and that takes about 5 minutes to get going. Netflix locks up all the time. I contacted Sony about my google TV and they said my internet was too slow. REALLY? Works fine with ipad and either of my laptops, and was okay for the first 1-2 years. I disconnected everything wireless to make sure I was not drawing down the bandwidth. Still bad. SO, I upgraded my DSL to 3megs after Sony suggested I do so, and still crappy.

When searching for a new TV, we typically tend to look at CNET and look at the reviews and specs that are offered there.

If you are not a computer person, you would NOT want this TV remote.  If you are a gadget person and love new cool gadgets, then this TV remote is for you.  It has options for the HOME screen, you can set your timer, you can navigate through your cable or Netflix, and also with this TV, navigate through the Internet.  The TV wirelessly syncs up with your home internet and is basically a computer TV after that.Another neat feature this TV has are the App options.  My children all love the fireplace App.  When they all want to \"camp out\" in the living room tent, they like to have the fireplace app on with either a little added jazz music, or even the sound of a thunderstorm.  The options are truly neat!The TV in and of itself is obviously large.  If not hanging on a wall mount, the TV can take up a lot of space with the way the stand is set up on it.  My daughter has this TV sitting on her dresser, and is only able to have the small cable box on the stand with it.  Her blue ray player will not fit because of the width of the stand.In addition to the good picture and sound quality, the TV is very sleek and aesthetically appealing to any room.While I recommend this TV whole heartedly, I do not recommend this TV for the person who may be electronic or computer lacking.

First reason being i don't have cable boxes, so the revue can't be used with tv content. The Sony google tv can integrate tv just plugging your cable in. I didn't miss it until i had it, it completes the experience. On capabilities, I would give Sony the strong advantage. I'm not sure what's different inside, but the Sony seems much faster, streaming hd video gives thr Revue a real work out, sometimes not working, but the Sony handles it just fine.  We've been able to stream Mtv shows and it upscales to hd stream no problem. The Revue had real trouble with this.My only real gripe is the keypad. I like the keypad itself but I'm the kind of person who will learn the layout of channel buttons to find at night without looking, not possible with this one. We use it at night in our bedroom, and you cannot find the number buttons without looking, and using the light of the tv. Backlit keypad would be much nicer. The thumb sensing mouse thing ( what is it?) works ok, but seems like it could be better. The remote is otherwise full of usefulness in a small package.The tv itself is beautiful. Chrome stand, high quality materials, not cheap plastic everywhere, glass front that goes to the edge, the sony on the front lights up, smooth white back so you can have it visible if you have that application, a nice cover over the cords in the back. I have a Sony 46v5100 that is 1080p 120hz that the Revue is on,  and the Sony google tv is a much nicer performer. I get a much nicer picture from the google tv, and dont miss the creepy 120hz. I'm not a tv expert, messing with tv tuning dvds or anything, but I do know that this one is a high quality display. I feel like since it is sort of a flagship for them with the Google tv, you get more attention to quality and detail. And since people are getting ants in there pants waiting for honeycomb based update with market, you can get an exceptional quality tv that was to be the flagship for a steep discount. But believe me Google tv is not dead, I've seen the leaked update for the revue, google tv is very much alive, and the update will expand function greatly.

Really haven't tried all of the features, but what I tried I have been fairly satisfied with. It is pretty straight-forward in setting up and getting it going. The remote is a little difficult to understand all of the functions, but I can get by with my types of use.Here's the catch... Sony service and warranty!!! First of all, I wish you could read the warranty info before buying. Here's what has happened: At exactly 6 months, I turn the TV on and it has a reddish vertical line about 1/3 to the left of the right hand side running all of the way through the LCD panel. I tried updating the TV, tried unplugging it, checked my other TV's to make sure it wasn't the cable companies fault. Nope, just this TV. So, I go to Sony's Website, get the email address for tech support and send them the info on the problem. The next day, I get a return email with suggestions to try and fix it. Of course none of them work. That begins my journey into the vast void of Sony customer service.I call the number they provided, go through numerous menu's, wait on hold for a great deal of time, then finally speak to someone. Of course their call center is outsourced and I can barely understand the person. That person says that they can't help me and gives me a different number, but will transfer me. After waiting, and my cell phone minutes are ticking off, I get another barely understandable person. They can't help me, so again I am transferred. This person says the TV needs an LCD panel replacement, and they can send me a \"refurbished\" TV. If it was within the first 30-days, they would send me a new one. I tell them that in my experience, when I have received refurbished electronics in the past, that the functionality might be okay, but I am getting someone else's used product and usually, there are scratches, dings, or something else less than what I had purchased. Secondly, if I wanted a refurbished product, I would have bought one in the first place and at a cheaper cost. So that person transfers me to the repair department. Then I'm told I need to speak with someone else. I'm given another number to call. They also transfer me... finally, a person says that it can be taken to an authorized Sony repair business and gives me a case number and a number to call. I call the repair place, and they tell me that Sony has told them that they can't do these types of repairs. So I call Sony back, go through the menu, wait on hold, then get transferred again. Now, this person says that there's another repair shop and calls them to verify and tells me that the shop will call me. Okay, 2 hours has gone by by now. I wait all day and no call, so I call them. Then I get a voicemail and leave my info. The person doesn't call me back. So the next day I call them again. \"Oh yeah,\" he says. \"I'll call Sony and see what they want me to do.\" I said they already gave you the case number and instructions... He says he still has to call them and will get right back to me. And by the way, he is in another town 108 miles away!!! Of course I don't hear from him.So today I call him back, and he says he still has to call them and will get back to me in 30 minutes. So I wait all day long and still haven't heard from him. Now my head wants to explode!!! I then call Sony back before they close for the day. Go through the extensive menu, then get another barely understandable person, and of course, I have to explain everything and then get transferred and of course was given the 6th Sony telephone number. The bottom line is that they are now forcing me to accept a refurbished TV. But first I have to send them a proof of purchase and give them my credit card info.All in all, I've spoken with 13 people, and have spent more than 4 hours on the phone!!! It will be the last Sony product I ever buy, and I have learned a valuable lesson, try to get ahold of the manufacturer's warranty before purchasing a product.

After some  research, I found a great deal on the Sony on Amazon. I must say that the idea of a GoogleTV did pick my curiosity. As far as the Internet functions, I was not disappointed, but the the TV quality really sucks for a Sony!!! The image is grainy, when the image contains many colors it has a tendency of being over saturated (sorry if the term is wrong, but it seemed appropriate). For a flat screen TV, the sound is ok. But the strength of this tv is its \"smart capabilities\", its remote take some time to figure out but is pretty cool!!!", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Cons and Pros, big on both.", "Author": "annieoftirol", "ReviewID": "R2BHMCPIPQN11H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am rating my overall user experience: First the bad: 1)This is a complex tv. The remote really takes studying and a lot of practice, because of the integrated google wifi, and other, functions. I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THE TV COMES WITH A 50 PAGE BOOK ABOUT VARIOUS LAWS AND LIMITATIONS BUT ONLY A FLIMSY 11 PAGE QUICK START MANUAL! NO PRINTED USER MANUAL. A tv of this complexity absolutely needs a hands on user manual. I constantly want to look up various functions and have to go online from one place to the next to finally (hopefully) find an answer. That is a big minus for me. 2)I have an old red/white audio speaker/receiver set up and tried to hook it up through the headphone jack, the sound is horrible, tinny and small. On my last tv, an aoc, this set up worked fine with great sound quality. The only other audio out here is the optical digital out, so I'd have to get a converter ($20-30) to get a hopefully better sound.If you don't have a high end audio system with optical digital, this tv will not work well.3) I already have a high end android phone and love it, including the android market, but compared to the android phone,the tv apps here are a joke. There are only about 50 apps in this tv 'market'. I tried a couple and they froze constantly.Most apps that are already on the tv, cannot be uninstalled. Much of it is bloat ware. I could not download the apps I already bought for my phone on the market. I had thought I could use my phone apps on the tv also, but that was wishful thinking. 4) I cannot access my email pop server. Just get a blank screen. One of the things I really was looking forward to was reading my ( non google)e-mail on the tv. I am also having trouble accessing some other  sites, just get a white page. I do not know if this is a limitation of google chrome or of the tv. There is no documentation to help.The good: 1)The picture looks to be of very high quality to me. I only watch basic limited cable and also antenna tv. Both come in beautifully. 2) I love that I can be on the web and still watch the tv channel in the PIP. 3) WIFI/google was very easy to set up with my home wifi. 4) The design is really top notch, the tv is much heavier than an LED tv but looks sleek and light.All in all,I had doubts about keeping this tv because of the limited sound options and the complexity of the tv/remote functions and usage. Then I realized that an LED sony tv without the google function would cost me more that this one did on sale. Since I love the picture and style of this tv, I guess its a keeper after all. I will probably upgrade my sound system in the future. I am hoping Sony will continue to update the software on this tv, because it definitely needs it.I appreciate the amazon 30 day return policy,as it gave me an opportunity to test out this tv without feeling stuck with it.Edited 12/18/2011. I hooked up my old Sharper Image audio system to the headphone plug and now have very good  sound. I have also used netflix and am totally pleased with the picture. Streams flawlessly. Picture quality remains excellent, I am more enthralled with this tv and am upgrading to a 4. Documentation issue remains a minus for me.Edited 01/26/2012: After another month of usage, I find the following: The tv function works great and I am very happy with it. Crystal clear picture on HD. On the other hand, the google/android function is pretty bad. I guess I am spoiled by my flawlessly functioning Android smartphone and the many things I am capable of using it for. The tv just isn't there yet. It seems to need a lot of software and hardware work (stronger processor) to be truly useful as an internet tv. The very limited number of applications that actually work well,the constant freezing, the constant stopping and starting when trying to play online videos,the many error messages and 'force closes' etc, etc, etc., make its use as an internet tv very frustrating for me. It's easier to just use the laptop and stream to the tv via HDMI cable.The good: The one great discovery was that my smartphone handles an android market application that turns the smartphone into a remote for the tv. So I use my sleek phone as a fully and very smoothly functioning remote for the google tv. Is that great or what?Would I buy the tv again knowing what I know now,after 2 months of usage? Probably not, I would wait for a more developed version. The frustration with the internet part of the tv is just too great.

Keefe", "ReviewID": "R2R9KLMXK26TV5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "For starters, the picture on this tv is fantastic, whether it's coming from a BluRay, Netflix, or live TV. I LOVE the picture quality. I also absolutely love that with the Plex app available on the Android Market, I can pull up all my tv shows and Movies that are shared from my server downstairs (it happily plays full 1080p content over my network which is wonderful!) If that's not enough, the netflix app works great, and the tv does a decent job of giving my a good listing of cable tv as well. It would be nice if Hulu would stop being stupid about allowing me to stream their content to this tv though (seriously, it just boggles my mind that they stubbornly refuse to allow this to happen on Google TV devices...) I am giving it one more month and I will be cancelling my Hulu Plus account if I still can't pull it up on this tv without hooking up one of my gaming consoles.Speaking of consoles, this is where this tv really falls short. You might notice the fact that there are 4 HDMI inputs, plus 1 composite input, which would let you play whatever gaming devices you like, but you would be mistaken. This tv is TERRIBLE for playing games. I have read complaints for many tv's out there about lag with games, but I have never seen anything THIS bad. It truly is unplayable, and Sony very arrogantly states that this is how this is TV is intended to function. Don't expect a Firmware Update from Sony to add something like a game mode to this TV. This is a huge bummer. Currently, my PS3 sits hooked up to it for BluRay and Hulu Plus, but since finding out just how awful the delay times are, gaming is not even an option, so I would kind of like for my PS3 to go back downstairs on my old Sony Projection TV where I can actually play games. What a JOKE. Absolutely pathetic.All in all, I kind of wish I would have passed on this TV. I still like it, but for all the awesome things it does, not having the option to play games is totally lame, and Sony flat out refusing to address the issue really bums me out. If we could hold out hope for a firmware update that would allow the TV to bypass all the processing that goes on to enable playing gaming, it would sting a bit less.If you have absolutely no interest in playing games on this television, and don't think you ever WILL have an interest in the future to play games, you really will fall in love with this TV. Minus the gaming thing, it's actually a really really great TV, with features on offer that you simply cannot find on any other TV. The remote really isn't that bad either,and even better than that, if you have an Android phone, you can get the Google TV Remote app for free and control your TV with your phone instead (which I find works even better than the included Sony remote).If I were to do it all over again, I would have purchased a regular HDTV, and then bought Sony's BluRay/Google TV combo box separately. This would give you all the great features of the Google TV integration, PLUS you would be able to hook a console or PC up to it and not experience the laughably bad delay times you will find with the all-in-one TV version.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good product", "Author": "rodi", "ReviewID": "R3M22FN5CWIJMD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We purchased this TV about 6-7 months ago.

Needless to say, we don't watch much TV, and we've never subscribed to any TV services. We're not into gaming either. We only watched DVDs and the occasional VHS. However, we do use the internet excessively from a variety of mobile devices. So really, we were looking for a television that had the simplicity, convenience, and elegance of a mobile internet device, but with a screen large enough for our living room (we live in an historic bungalow, so our living room is not large). The NSX-40GT1 continues to fit that bill. We now subscribe to Netflix, though we still don't subscribe to cable TV. Between the Chrome browser, YouTube, the Google PlayStore Apps, Netflix, our first gen Apple TV, and our DVDs we now have way more entertainment than we have time or motivation to engage in. Even the Netflix seems like an unnecessary expense at times.Our only concern is that Google will neglect, or even abandon the Google TV service like they plan to do with their iGoogle service (really misguided move IMO).  At this point in time, we are still seeing new apps in the PlayStore arrive every now and then, and the occasional update, so I have no complaints. I just hope Google and the App providers don't forget about those of us who invested as the first generation of adopters.

Overall a good buy for a normal user.Before buying i had read a few reviews who really wanted to use this as a computer than a television.  probably for those folks this television is going to have some hickups ... but for normal television users who want netflix/internet access thru a television .. this a very good buy ...", "Date": "August 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love the TV on many levels", "Author": "L Family \"Avid book reader\"", "ReviewID": "R1LR29NEEI11DB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bout this TV in December 2011 for Christmas.

The browser is just like any other browser it has Google-Crome browser inbuilt and you can open any website mostly the same way you open any in your PC or Laptop.

Picture QualityAbsolutely stunning! Great picture quality. I can't believe how good the picture quality from Netflix and Amazon instant movies is. Picture from AT&T; U-verse looks great (plugged in with an HDMI cable). I haven't seen too many complaints about picture quality from other reviews, but if you happen to see any I would absolutely disregard them.2. I/OTons of inputs, more than my 56\" Samsung DLP. Over all plenty of I/O so no worries there. My favorite feature are the 4 usb ports. You can plug in a flash drive or external hard drive and play .avi, .mkv, and other movie formats directly on your TV flawlessly.3. Google TVThis feature is amazing. Google TV takes your cable (or satellite) service and combines it with services such as Netflix, Amazon Instant, etc. and gives you a well organized browser to choose from different movies and TV shows. It definitely creates a fun, and quite unique, media experience.4. Android appsLet me start off by saying I am a die hard Apple fanatic. I own an iTouch, iPhone, iPad, iMac, and several other apple devices. I was expecting to be disappointed by the app selection for the TV. Although I still prefer Apple apps hands down, there is a surprisingly good selection of different apps to choose from.5. Keyboard RemoteI have read quite a few complaints about the remote and I say rubbish!!! This remote is the coolest TV remote I've ever played with. Works great, optical mouse isn't perfect but I really don't use it all that much. The main thing I love about the remote is it can control all of your devices so you don't have 5 or 6 remotes to fiddle with.OverallI love this TV and I am so glad I purchased it. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an internet TV with loads of features. I had a few concerns after reading some reviews, but any bad things I've read are because of the following:A. People are stupid and/or techno-retardedB. One person says their Google TV is stupid and only does Netflix well. That is complete rubbish, I have browsed the internet on the TV and if it takes you 10 minutes to type a few sentences you have some serious problems.

Picture quality aside (not that it isn't great) the functionality of this set blows all other smart tvs out of the water. I can surf the web, download and play games from the android marketplace, and even sync files wirelessly from my computer, all while showing live tv in the corner of the screen. Of course, it also has netflix and amazon. In fact, this tv reminds me more of a giant ipad with television built in.The picture quality is absolutely stunning for being only 60 hz. The blacks are black, and the brights are beautiful. i did notice some very very VERY slight graininess when viewing dark parts of blu ray movies, but that may have more to do with my blu ray set up - cheap player, cheap HDMI cable - than the actual tv since i've only noticed it on movies and not my other hd content.The audio sounds better than most led televisions, but then again thats not saying much. I would have been fine with the sound as it was, but I went ahead and hooked the tv up to some cheap computer speakers with a sub.There's not much to say about the build other than its thin, sturdy, and beautiful. I'd expect this thing to last until the screen quits.The only real complaints I ever came across when researching this tv was that it had video game lag and possible problems with brightness uniformity. My set has no brightness issues whatsoever from what I can tell. As for the video game problem, I haven't tested it out myself yet since this tv is only a secondary set i'm using for my bedroom, but I will update the review if I do. Even if there is a problem it wont really bother me as video games aren't the reason why i bought this tv.Overall, this tv is incredible. For $599 (originally $999), I almost felt like I was stealing. With a price like that, I can only guess they are trying to move all of their inventory so they can replace it with a new (more expensive) model. If I were buying this as my main entertainment television, i would probably wait for the new version since most of the gaming problems will probably be fixed and it will likely have more hz. As a secondary tv for a bedroom, this set is more than perfect.UPDATEI finally got around to testing out my wii and i will admit there is a small lag. Fortunately i was able to go to custom picture mode and make a setting that eliminated most of it. Also, a couple days ago google rolled out an update to Honeycomb 3.2, which among other things, made browsing the internet much much faster. the performance is now comparable to my computer if not faster at times. The loading times for apps is much shorter and the menu is now extremely snappy. All three of those things were my only real complaints about the tv.

It took a few times and I have nearly all but still missing 2 channels.Google TV is the name given for the package of internet shortcuts included in the internet menu.The problem with this is most are useless short movie clips, obscure internet videos that aren't the least bit interesting, and a few radio stations, with access to Netflix and Amazon movies IF... you pay for those. There are some movies but they are stretched out to about 2.5 hours with all the commercials they put in them. Forget that. But, I will say that the quality of an internet movie is amazingly good, as others have commented on Netflix movies (haven't done this yet).The news site presets offered are mostly liberal in content. There are about 3 CNN sites, MSNBC, NPR, NY Times, USA TOday, no FOX NEWS of course.If you have older components such as (SONY) VCR, Older (SONY) Play station, Older (SONY) DVD, camera with USB cord forget about being able to hook them all up, they are completely obsolete to this TV as it only has a SINGLE component video (while most TVs half this price offer several) and 4 HDMI inputs and 4 USB inputs for...?....something with USB outputs? I don't know, I just know my camera pics wouldn't show up on it when I hooked my camera to it using USB cable.It has no audio out (like my old 27\" tube Sony had). I ended up getting a Y chord out of the head phone jack to hook it into my surround sound (lame).Added: I did find that if I put the VCR between the antenna and TV coax connector and turn TV to channel three, it would work, thus hooking anything with RCA jacks up to VCR front inputs will work too.The picture is good, after I customized it to my liking. You better be a tech wiz because the menu is extremely difficult to navigate. It has a LOT of options and the names of each option are somewhat vague.The remote is kind of nice for typing but if you want to put in a station quickly, you have to use 2 hands for the decimal point for over the air stations. The same for settings, it takes 2 hands and 2 buttons. It will not give you a quick list if you put in a number like my $40 converter box did. I could use one hand for my old converter box remote and quickly put in stations. Not so with this Sony beast remote.I couldn't get the Menu icon to work. Tech support told me to resest to factory which would lose my entire setup. Forget that. I can still get to settings by pushing 2 buttons on remote at same time (crazy).At first I didn't think it would run my old Sony AV receiver but after a while I figured out that the optical wires that came with it can be positioned over the sensor to the old receiver and the old code can be entered in the TV settings to run it. HOWEVER, it will not run it until the TV is fully booted up and if you turn your TV off first, you cannot turn your AV off using that remote. The functionality is limited, changing inputs and volume, on/off is it I think , maybe pause.It has a screen saver for the internet displays but takes an extremely long time to activate. I didn't see anywhere to adjust that time. (added: I did find this eventually and set it to 10 minutes)An old Sony remote will control this TV (slight plus).Some said it does not have this but it does have a \"last channel\" feature if you hit the \"Tab\" button on remote (weird).It locked up a few times navigating through the menu, complete with a \"submit\" option for sending the error (a la Windows style) to...Sony? not sure.This TV could have been so much more useful but they seemed to have concentrated on making it merely a novelty without practicality.After 2 weeks of trying to figure it out, I'm stuck with this thing but I would recommend looking for another internet TV with more features, easier menu, more convenient remote, less liberally biased internet content options, and better backwards compatiblity, as far as input connectors go, for older technology if you need it.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Skip this", "Author": "roger", "ReviewID": "R3NOJS2QDQRZBE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you plan to get Netflix ....

I shopped around and found this Sony.  It cost the same, $600, as the similar Sony LED TV without google TV, so I took the plunge.  First thing that I don't like about the TV two of what I consider very basic TV functions.  In order to set the sleep timer you need to dig down a menu tree.  That's ridiculous since this is a function I use pretty much every day!  Not to mention that you need to press two buttons simultaneously to get to the menu.  There is no last channel button on the remote.  So you can't jump back and forth between two channels.  This remote must have been designed by a woman because men can't live without the last channel button. :)  The remote is also pretty big, but when you start to use the google TV functions you will be happy they included a full keyboard.  It makes a big difference.The other part I am not thrilled with is the picture quality.  HD channels come across with an OK picture, for an HD TV.  Other channels look pretty bad.  I tried playing with the basic settings, but I could not improve the picture much.  I'm not sure if I need to get a set up DVD and run it through it's paces or if this is as good as the picture gets.  I think I just need to adjust the settings because with internet content and when using my PS3 the picture is very good.  In either case I would have expected the TV to come out of the box with a better picture when using the built in tuner.One thing that is very obvious is that what ever picture manipulation they use for internet content works very well.  Youtube videos that only look so-so on a computer come across as passable on this TV.  There is a PIP function so that you can watch TV and surf at the same time, but I was not too thrilled that the smaller window has only 4 distinct locations on the screen.  I would have preferred to be able to size the window to the exact size I want and to be able to position it to the exact location I want.This runs some flavor of Android, so you can download apps to run on the TV.  So far I have not tried that function yet.Right now I am on the fence as to whether I like this TV or not.  There are some good things going for it, like the built in computer and ability to run internet content.  But the missing buttons for the sleep timer and last channel really turn me off to this TV.  I'm going to try my picture set up DVD on the TV to see if I can tweak the picture to get the best out of the TV.

I don't like when sony monitors the comments on any website and responds to customers like they haven't tried everything like contacting them. This isn't customer error so stop trying to mislead ppl. All of this reminds me of when the PS3 came out and everyone's system over heated and sony didn't have a solution nor did they refund our money. When they realized their was a problem they quickly came out with a thinner version of the PS3 to cover up the problem.
