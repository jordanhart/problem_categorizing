{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Love this Vizio", "Author": "Leslie", "ReviewID": "R3N2X9I3R0YXBZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had put off purchasing a new tv for ages and looked at all that I came across in all stores. Read reviews, researched reports looked and measured ones to make sure they would fit in the apace it was destined to go into. I didn't need Wi-Fi so that was not a concern. I saw this model is several retail stores against non LED's and loved the resolution. It has more than enough HMDI connection possibilities and the sound was just fine.It was extremely easy to set up. I have it mounted via a Vizio was bracket which is perfect.In short this HDTV fit my bill perfectly, I have NO complaints whatsoever.The delivery of the unit was great no damage and on time.I would highly recommend this HDTV.", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very disappointed, Vizio", "Author": "Joseph Katarivas \"Joseph Katarivas\"", "ReviewID": "R1DIMUZEMIFMDG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "PROS: +Great picture+Extremely thin and light+Plenty of ports (HDMI, component, etc.)CONS: -HDMI ports 2, 3, and 4 were all damaged out of the box-Horrific sound-Unfamiliar manufacturer/help-Lifespan (8 months)For those needing further detail, I will go a bit more in-depth in relation to the overall quality of the product. So, first thing I noticed when opening the box was that it was very well packed, nothing was loose or bouncing around (no chance of accidental scratches). Upon plugging it in and completing the initial setup, what came to my attention was that fact that HDMI ports 2, 3, and 4 were not working...PERIOD! Whatever was plugged into port 1 appeared on the screens of port 2, 3, and 4. Apparently, HDMI problems are quite common with this model. I also quickly realized just how poor the quality of the sound was. The picture was gorgeous, however. Well, I called Vizio, and they very quickly and efficiently setup an appointment, and the repairman arrived right around when he said he would.Things are all downhill from here. Despite his friendly demeanor, the gentleman had absolutely no idea where to begin after opening up the back of the television. He had to call his boss and speak on the phone for about twenty minutes, upon which I was told that his boss also had no idea how to fix this. For a common problem (so I read on the Internet), you'd think they would have a bit more knowledge about it. The repairman decided to wing it, which frightened me but I just wanted to use my new TV. After taking out the replacement parts he was given, he noticed that they forgot to send him one. Marvelous! After an hour of playing around, we attempted several methods of fixing it. Not a one worked.Come day two, the same guy is back, and he is still unable to resolve the problem. He went about his business after failing once again, and I was left unsatisfied. But I sucked it up and pushed forward, attempting to enjoy my new televison. After less than a year, it has officially died after what I read is called \"the pop of death.\"I am very very unhappy with this product.", "Date": "November 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ok", "Author": "DoubtingThomas", "ReviewID": "R3BNLZEPQS2KH5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It is not the best TV, but it's okay for its price point.

Allshouse", "ReviewID": "R2HPTLMAGZK23S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This TV has the strangest problem I have ever seen. If I plug a digital audio cable into it, for a soundbar, I can no longer change the input on the TV. So, I can improve the horrible sound of the TV only if I never want to use any other HDMI input. No DVD player, no xbox, no nothing. Yeah, that's what I bought a modern TV for. I cannot recommend you buy this TV.", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Vizio 42\" LED/LCD Telivision", "Author": "S.

I have always bought my Vizio's local but I couldn't pass up the price of this one. The only problem was the TV was VERY poorly packaged. It appeared to have been used before as the manual was missing and the styrofoam surrounding the tv was broken along with a lot of added packaging tape around the box. I have to say though the TV plays fine and with the LED backlit LCD screen the picture is great. I am just disapointed at the thought I bought a second hand TV.", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$649.99", "Features": "42-inch LCD HDTV with Full HD 1080p resolution and VIZIO Razor LED backlighting\nBuilt-in ambient light sensor adjusts backlight levels based on surroundings\nView full-screen slideshows of your JPG photos from connected USB devices\nSRS audio technologies for virtual surround sound and volume smoothing\nFour HDMI inputs for connecting your Full HD sources\n100,000 to 1 Dynamic Contrast Ratio\n1080p Full HD resolution\nAmbient Light Sensing Technology\nEdge Lit Razor LEDTM backlighting\nSRS TruSurround HD and SRS TruVolume audio", "Name": "VIZIO E420VT 42 Inch Class Edge Lit Razor LED LCD HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41eLDoFeOrL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004T1YADE"}}
