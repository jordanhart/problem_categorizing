If you plan on using for say a bedroom, or dorm, or something for the kids, it should work out fine. As is customary, the audio is not that great. Picture quality is acceptable.

The picture goes black after a few seconds of powering on, and will not turn off without unplugging it entirely. Up until it died on me, it was a decent 29'' TV with a solid picture and good sound, so there was really nothing to complain about considering the price is less then $200. It served it's purpose while it lasted. The fact that it only lasted 2 years is rather disappointing, but worked fine up until that point.Overall, this is an ok TV considering the price, but if you do make this purchase, i strongly recommend purchasing the 3 year warranty with it. Im not the only person whose Haier TV died sooner than expected.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Giftees love it!", "Author": "Melanie26", "ReviewID": "R2DPBQ0BB7HZKS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband and I bought this for our 75 year old neighbors for the computer room, they purchased a second tv, different brand, for their kitchen and ending up returning it because it was not nearly as good quality as this one.

Your Haier TV will go blank on you it will start with a snowy screen then in will turn to a black screen. The TV will not let you turn it off by the power button or remote. Holding the power button will not reset it nor holding the menu and power the same time will do nothing at all. Your Haier TV might work fine for a couple of months to a year. The first symtoms will be going snowy then blank then you cannot even power down. When that happens you are pretty much a** out.
