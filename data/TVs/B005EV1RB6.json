{"Reviews": [{"Title": "1080p, but really only 1 HDMI input", "Author": "S. Palmer", "ReviewID": "R3LLFPZJDAMFQ6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am using this TV in a bedroom to watch TV shows.  I do not do any gaming.Great picture- true 1080p in a 24\" screen is rare.  Colors are natural and blacks are rendered nicely.  Ghosting is not a problem at all, even at 60hz.  Remote is good quality and easy to use, but it only controls the TV (it's not universal).  OSD is surprisingly well thought out.  Speakers are better than average for a TV of this size and I have no trouble understanding dialog, but you can always use the digital audio output or headphone jack to connect external speakers.  Good looking TV and pretty thin.The only bad thing about this TV is that it really only has one HDMI jack.  \"HDMI 2\" is for satellites, cable boxes, blu-ray, etc. and has both audio and video.  \"HDMI 1\" is meant to be used with computers so only video is accepted- the audio input for \"HDMI 1\" is in the form of a mini headphone jack connection.  Viewsonic did this for people who have older computers that use a DVI connection (HDMI's predecessor that only passed a video signal).  So \"HDMI 1's\" audio has to be input via a mini headphone style cable.  You could still attach, say, a blu-ray player to \"HDMI 1\" by using an HDMI cable for the video and an RCA to mini headphone cable for the audio.  You can also use an \"HDMI port saver\" or an HDMI switch to swap multiple HDMI inputs through the \"HDMI 2\" input.I would absolutely buy this TV again if I needed another one.  My first choice was a 24\" Panasonic, but it turns out that it is only 720p, NOT 1080p like the advertisements say.  I probably wouldn't have noticed the lower resolution from my bed, but I wanted true 1080p in case I ever used this as a computer monitor.  1080p has double the pixels of 720p.This TV is listed for sale by many Amazon merchants (in different posts than this one) for a lot more than Amazon lists it for (I bought it directly from Amazon).  I think this is because other merchants are advertising this unit as a \"worldwide\" model since it can accept 120-240 volts.  My GUESS is that it can display European frame rates (25hz and 50hz) but I don't have any European videos to test it with, so I don't know for sure.Here are the settings that I recommend for use with a dish, which is highly compressed when compared to blu-ray video:PICTURE:Picture mode- personalContrast-14Brightness- 50Sharpness- 16Tint- 50Color-30Color mode- personalAspect ratio- normalNoise reduction- middleOPTION:Transparent- 75%DCR- offBacklight- lowHDMI overscan- offUPDATE 3/4/13:I hooked up a new laptop to this unit and it gave me the option of playing video at 25hz. So I tried it and it worked.  The laptop didn't give an option for 50hz, so I still don't know if it can play 50hz.", "Date": "October 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "This a GREAT HDTV - We are VERY pleased with this!", "Author": "The Legal Beagle", "ReviewID": "RFEAXH3YFCZ9A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a Christmas gift to my wife.  We unpacked it, and installed a Comcast compact cable converter box (used double sided 3M HD Velcro tape and it fit neatly on the back of the TV with a 12\" HDMI cable).  The HD viewing is especially good, and we enjoy it every day in our sitting room.  I would recommend this unit to anyone.
