{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good value on 32 inch LCD", "Author": "J. Foster", "ReviewID": "R2M87T95IY4COF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Toshiba 32AV502U seems to be a good value for a 720p LCD.  It was easy to set up on the stand; the hook-up to my cable, TIVO unit, and playstation was easy; the initial set up for all the available channels was pretty easy and fast; and the picture is great.  The only negatives are that the remote control & remote control buttons are too small, the ability of the set to switch between various functions seems a little slow (in other words moving from one menu screen to the next), and the process of switching back and forth between inputs is especially slow and tedious.  Maybe as I learn more about the functions I can figure out a faster way to accomplish this but I haven't found anything in the manual yet or by playing with the various buttons.", "Date": "November 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Suits my needs perfectly - great image for the money", "Author": "David Bauckham", "ReviewID": "R1QG99CN6QZXMT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this product for about three weeks now, and so far I am very pleased with it.  The picture, which I receive from an indoor/outdoor antenna is extremely crisp.  I would recommend those of you out there pondering whether or not to get cable/satellite to consider simply installing a good antenna - that way there is no video compression, and you actually get a sharper image from the local networks.  I honestly cannot tell the difference between my TV's image as a 720p and my brother-law's 47\" 1080p Sony.The TV menu is easy to see and use.  I keep my video settings on sports generally, as it is the brightest picture (some of the others, like \"movie\" are just too dark for me).  However, you can also adjust the picture in preference mode, and play around with brightness, sharpness, contrast, backlight, color, and tint.I also own a wii system, and even though it is not high definition like some other gaming systems, I have to say that the picture on this TV is excellent (especially with the wii component cables attached).The sound on the TV is also very full - I did not notice any tinniness coming from the speakers at all, and it seemed well balanced between base and treble. It will obviously not produce the same depth of sound as a full sound system, but it suits my needs perfectly.There is, as the other reviewer indicated a minor lag time when switching between inputs, but this really doesn't bother me.  One mildly annoying element however is that most of the inputs (HDMI, component cables (AKA color stream), PC inputs, S-Video, etc.) are on the back of the TV, which is a mild nuisance. The only exception to this is Video 2, which is on the side.  (This would probably be good for connecting a digital camcorder and the like).The only other thing that seems a little inconsistent is PC connectivity.  When I hook up my laptop (I use an RGB computer video cable and audio cable since my computer doesn't have a built in HDMI port) it is necessary for me to turn the laptop off, connect the cables and then reboot, or the image will not display on the TV.  Perhaps this is a standard thing for most TVs - I don't really know, having never owned an HDTV with PC inputs before.  Also, the TV seems to project the computer screen a little differently each time the computer is hooked up, and I sometimed have to do a little tweaking to get an image I'm happy with.  This may just require more trial-and-error on my part.  Since my primary purpose is to use the TV as a TV screen and DVD player and not a computer screen, this isn't a big deal to me.On the whole, I am extremely satisfied with this purchase.  It does its job well, displaying an excellent, non-pixelated image and it is even an energy star product, so it should save energy and money.  There are other good deals on the market, but I really think that this is one of the best.  It is hard to beat the price being offered by Amazon right now.I will update later if my opinion of this product changes or I have anything more to add.", "Date": "December 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Beautiful, seems like best bang for buck", "Author": "Brian De Leon", "ReviewID": "R1OMU62BQOTOJE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this LCD the weekend of Black Friday. I was hesitant, but i could not pass up on the price match I was getting. It comes in a big box, light sturdy.Initial set up was easy plug and play done. The stand is easy to place and comes with screws. Channel set up is easy,finds the channels fast. This has different mode sin which you can set, for an example; gaming mode, theater mode, sports mode, and normal. I use this especially for gaming with my PS3 and Oh my God it is BEAUTIFUL! picture is so crips and clear.the only problems I discovered isremote lags at times. Really oversize remote. Buttons sometimes lag to perform.A few times my speakers seem to crackle, pop.then come back to orignal sound, but i think it may because im still on regular cable. but otherwise ok.the lcd hd tv is very sexy, sleek looking I LOVE IT!", "Date": "December 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "great picture short life span.", "Author": "Robert V.

I find the picture as good or better than the picture on my Sony Bravia which was much more expensive. The speaker quality is average (hence the 4 stars), but since I have mine hooked up with a surround system, it is a non issue for me.  If you plan to use the TV speakers and like to crank the sound up, you might be a little dissappointed as they are a bit tinny and don't have much power.  The speakers are good for everyday users.As far as overall product quality, I know that Sony is SUPPOSED to be the better brand, BUT I have had three other Toshiba products over the last 16 years, 2 TVs, and my laptop and they are all working great. Never had an issue. I have had three Sony products, a camcorder, the surround in my living room, and the Bravia over the last 7 years and I have had every single product break down on me to some degree or another.  Sony always comes at a premium price so it is my experience that Toshiba is undervalued.I will stick with Toshiba from now on.", "Date": "January 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great value, very happy with this purchase", "Author": "Lucky", "ReviewID": "R1N8X742LVENT7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV after returning a Sony 32M4000.The picture looks great and the price was considerably cheaper than the Sony. The Sony's picture looked washed out when viewed from an angle and it made people's faces look like the living dead.  I do not notice this with the Toshiba.  The picture looks wonderful.  I also like that the connections on the back are pointed in the downward direction (rather than toward the wall) so that your cables do not have to make a 90 degree bend.I'm using it in a bedroom so I didn't see a need for 1080P resolution.

Most mounts come with 100x100, 100X200 or 200X200.I bought a Peerless Mount PA740 for $65.00 from Amazon then I had to buy an additional adapter plate for $79.00. So make sure you buy the correct mount for this tv. Other than that the picture is superb.It comes with the latest HDMI v1.3 connections.I used a MONOPRICE HDMI v1.3 cable and I am amazed at the quality of the picture this cable produced. I paid only $5.35 for this cable. I have always used Monster cables but this cable is as good.I don't know if it's better but that's all I can afford at this time with the economy the way it is. The reason I did not give this set 5 stars is the VESA 200X400 information which they could have put on the box to make life easier.I had to wait an extra week to mount the tv.", "Date": "December 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good Value...", "Author": "D.

The feature of this TV is great it is HD ready and HDMI ready too. I've hooked up my Xbox 360 to the HDMI port and just wow the game look so clear and even when I watch movies they are just great. The good thing about it is that I still have 1 more port for HDMI so I can still hook up something there if I needed so. There is a port for your computer if you do ever wanted to use the TV as your own monitor. I have tried and it look really nice, but then it didn't made any sense for me to use this feature at all just because I still had my computer monitor, but for the people who still have those bulky comps then this is a good alternative.Overall this product is a good buy and just good quality hey it is a Toshiba we are talking about here they make good TVs.", "Date": "January 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Toshiba 32\" HDTV", "Author": "linda s hinkley", "ReviewID": "R2U8F9CRTG413X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A 5-star product.

The coaxial tuner failed (everything else still works) and the Toshiba 32AV502U was the unit Assurant sent me as a replacement.When  I turned it on for the first time, I saw right away why people were willing to pay twice what I paid for my Norwood Micro TV. Only then did I see the wear my old TV had taken. The contrast between the blacks and whites was amazing compared to the cheap TV I first bought. The sound quality was great for built-in sound and even though the TVs had similar specs, the Toshiba blew away the Norwood Micro. I watch TV through my XBOX and the color is amazing. I switch it to my computer and I can see in such detail! HDTV through my cable box is sooooo crisp!The only issue I run into every once in a great while is it occasionally \"crashes\" while in use. All of a sudden, I just get loud static and whatever I'm watching is gone. It seems I have to hold the power button to turn it off. Once I turn it on, it's fine again for a long time. The problem is it didn't happen often for me to call Toshiba while under warranty.

It's great in regular LCD digital channels, but when I switch it to HDTV..OMG..the picture is superb. One feature we love is when you MUTE it..it \"half mutes\" on the first click, meaning it goes alot lower in volume yet not totally muted, Than when I click again, it's totally muted. I recommend this Toshiba 32\" TV to everyone who wants a great TV at a great price. We also have 2 more TV's..a superb SCEPTRE & a superb Sharp 32\" LCD HDTV, yet the Toshiba has us hooked.

The difference between LCD and CRT is truly amazing. I got it at a really good price and even if deflation drops HDTV prices through the floor (at which point I will cry), I'll feel proud that I helped the sagging American economy as much as I could. Seriously, if you're on the fence, go ahead an get it. It's a well built, solid, crisp, sharp little machine and you'll love it. Like another reviewer said, though, if within a month or so it's sputtering and tweaking on me, I'll revise this so fast it will make yer head spin.UPDATE: As of 5/18/09 still working fine. I'm very pleased with the set. But, keep it dusted!UPDATE 2: 7/20/09 Have bought a Sony upscaling DVD player. Now am watching the TV at 1080i. Yes, there is a difference. It's not knock your socks off different, but I do notice it.UPDATE 3: 4/5/10 Still going strong. I have to make an amendment to the previous update to correct misinformation. The TV does NOT play at 1080i (even though the screen display says so). Apparently it's only recognizing that the PLAYER is 1080i. It is playing at 720. What I've research about these LCD tv's is that while they are not as long lasting as the old CRTs that would go for twenty years or more, they are improving at such fast clips these days that you'll probably be buying an improvement before the thing goes blooey anyway. Me, I'm already wanting a 47 inch. Or higher. How quickly we get spoiled.UPDATE: 2/11/11 Twice this TV has \"glitched\" on me by \"solarizing\" the picture. Meaning, the colors begin to burn in the highlights and the overall cast of it turns green. It's easily fixed by turning it off and on again, but I'm keeping my eye on this.
