{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great TV but it has its flaws!", "Author": "Lorenzo Ruiz \"lodown505\"", "ReviewID": "RRDKW1YUWI8RM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I always wanted a big freaking TV. All my friends always had a bigger one than me, so when tax time came around I bought a 50 inch Vizio and later on, found this 55 inch Sanyo TV for the EXACT same price. What a bargain!The TV was not too hard to handle in its box. I loaded and unloaded it by myself with minimal trouble, but the hardest part was getting it out of the box by myself. This thing says it weighs in the neighborhood of 60 pounds but I think it's closer to 80. But then again I was out of shape. Anyway it's REALLY big. And bright. Here's a list of pros and cons.PROS*Huge!*Very vivid colors and bright display with dark blacks.*Game Mode eliminates lag on videogames!*RGB input for PC!*More than one HDMI port.*Two video inputs; One Composite, one component.*USB Ports for those of you who use them.Unfortunately here are the cons.*HEAVY. Very, very awkward as well.*The composite (AV) video is weird. Without game mode on, there's a noticeable delay in action on screen and with it on, it freezes the images on the screen for a full second once every ten seconds. Irritating to the core.*When you set the TV on game mode, it won't stay on it when you turn the television off. If you want lag-free TV every time, for example when playing video games, you have to switch to Game Mode every single time. Sucks when you lose the remote as well.*The TV is not very loud at all. I put on a CD and cranked this sucker up to 100 and I could still literally talk over it. So whatever it sounds like at 55, that's as loud as it'll stay, unfortunately unless I am missing something.I'm satisfied because I've gotten used to the flaws, but at the same time I shouldn't have to. Yes, it's a gorgeous TV and I am super proud I can trump all of my friends and their puny TVs with it, but I can't deal with the fact that I have to depend on the remote so heavily. I actually wish I hadn't traded in the Vizio but the only reason I did was because the Vizio lacked an RGB (PC) port, which I needed for my studio and unfortunately I threw away the box AND receipt from Walmart and I don't feel like carrying it anymore. Sadly, I haven't heard of a way to conquer the Component flaw either, so I'm stuck in channel-changing limbo and dealing with either a lag or a freeze every ten seconds. It sucks and is very distracting.I'm giving this television four stars because it's impressive with the RGB input, two HDMI inputs and the 120 hz as well as its impressive size and array of features. But once you get into details it proves itself to be a trojan horse of frustration. Buyer beware!
