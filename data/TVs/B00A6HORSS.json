Really efficient.", "Author": "animatt", "ReviewID": "R1SJPDNU0EWI8C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This will be mostly about power consumption as I have had tv for only a few days.  It will get updated in the future if anything major happens.I bought this for an old motorhome that I will be living in full time(offgrid).  I really wanted a tv with low electrical consumption so I did not have to run generator all the time.So first I looked at dc tv's with integrated dvd.  Working directly off batteries will save me some power as to not need to run an inverter. Inverters have standby loses and efficiency losses when actually inverting power.  I will have an inverter but to run a microwave when needed.Okay so looking at a dc tv with dvd. Also must be led as that will save a lot of power as well.  For our space the 19\" seems fine.  I am sure 22 and 24 inches versions consume very little for their sizes 19\" would consume even less energy.After about a week after I order product it finally arrived. Broke out a kilo watt meter and plug tv into the wall.To plug this tv into 110v you need to use the supplied power brick.  IT is sized 4 amps at 12v so it is a 48 watt power supply.  I was unsure of this as the old dc/ac tv we does not have a power brick.Anyway so plugged power brick into tv then into the kilowatt meter and then finally into the wall.I tried to take power readings of a few different scenarios.  The highest I ever saw on the meter was right around 20watts when the dvd spun up.  That was a peak.Playing music cd actually seems to use the most power.  Drawing 18.9-18.3  volume on high then low.  If tv is on high volume and you hit mute it does not seem to drop down to 18.3  that only seems to happen if you manually lower volume. I am totally guessing here but imagine when you hit mute it just disables input into the speakers but they stay on. Really not a big deal just stating my observations.With a music dvd.  Basic a normal dvd but music and slower moving scenes not super fast.volume 70% 18.3-18.7w  turning brightness from lowest to highest setting I could not tell if any difference in power consumption.  MAybe .1 watt. On high brightness the tv gets a very washed out look but it is fine atleast for me. I did not buy tv for state of the art system.  I bought it to keep power consumption down while being able to watch simple tv.Pressing pause while dvd is playing dvd keeps spinning but image on tv is stationary. Waited a few moments but dvd keep spinning.  This drops power consumption .1-.2 watts.  When I hit stop button tv image goes back.  THis says another .1 watt while dvd keeps spinning.Eject dvd to stop if from spinning drops another .8 watts and sits at 17.3 watts while on dvd input.  After a few moments screen goes into a screen saver mode where a colored oval bounces around. Power is between 16.9-17.5watts while this is happening.Time to hook up cable.  It seems to need to do a scan of the channels or I could not find how to bypass this step.  Took a while to scan.  and uses 14.2-14.6 watts during this time.  While waiting I figured I check the PF reading on the meter and was around .36va  .  kind of horrible.  I blame the power brick, seems lite and probably very cheap.During view of tv at 50% brightness which looks the best to me power ranged from 14.5-15.2 Here the volume from low to high seemed to affect power consumption a bit more.Using the hdmi connection I hooked up an android device and ran netflix on the device.  Output sound and video to the tv.  The tv's power consumption for this time was........14.0-14.9  depending on volume and scene action. lower volume tended to be lower.  again did not check screen brightness.  I attribute this being lower as now tv is not running its tuner.Also power consumption when off flickers between 0.0 watts and 0.3 watts.  Seems energy efficient to me.  Although I will probably unplug when using in off grid setting.I can only assume since all this testing is happening with an ac/dc adapter that when run from a dc source power consumption would be knocked down a few points.  I could be wrong but seeing how it uses so little power to begin with I do not see the power supply being something they would spend money on and make very efficient. Assuming 90% efficient power supply 18 watts ac would translate to 16.2 watts dc.  That would be roughly 1.3 amps from a 12v(12.4v average) battery. or 14.5 watts ac would be 13.05 watts dc assuming 90% efficient. 13.05 would be roughly 1.05 amps at 12.4v.For those motor home users out there. The standard incandescent lights in my old motor home used around 18 watts PER bulb. This tv will use less power than a single light bulb.  This just reinforces two things. One incandescent bulbs are horribly inefficient(I changed to led bulbs)  and this tv is very efficient.Once I have the tv installed in operation on dc power I will measure power again for at least a few scenarios and post update.  This time with a clamp meter and a volt meter.That is the end of power consumption figures.  It seems like a fine tv but not sure if that will last.Controller seems to suck though.  We will see in the future. Like most say about these tvs the volume is weak.  All tvs in these classes will have weak speakers, but for our situation volume and quality is fine.", "Date": "February 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Average TV at Best", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "R1VZX33V5EVU3M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this TV to replace and old CRT TV in my conversion van, as there are very few options for TVs that come with a 12 volt car adapter. I could have used a power inverter but didn't want the extra component nor the inefficiencies of converting DC to AC to DC. I started by building a TV mount that sat in the cavity where the old TV was. I then mounted this TV and hooked it all up. It worked fine, but the viewing angle was horrible, and I couldn't see the TV from the middle seats in the van, since I was sitting slightly below the TV, looking up. I ended up added a spacer to the top part of the TV mount to get it to angle down and that solved the problem. It doesn't look nearly as nice as if I would have been able to mount it flush, but at least it works.Keep in mind that I didn't buy this TV for everyday use, so my criteria is likely different from yours, but I gave my 3-star rating based on the following:Pros:- Includes 12-volt adapter- Built-in DVD player removes the need for extra component- Decent picture (when viewed straight on)Cons:- Poor viewing angle- Buttons on remote need to be pushed very hard before they registerSo all-in-all, this is an average TV, and I primarily bought it for the 12-volt feature. If I was looking for a TV for everyday use, I would probably buy a name-brand TV.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Falsely advertised", "Author": "CHB", "ReviewID": "R33EVGW96B90BP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is NOT a 1080p 120HZ set as advertised, therefore it has NONE of the benefits of those features.

The color is very muted (mostly blue/gray, not very life-like), the sound is quite tinny, too.  I tried playing around with the settings, but it was also very hard for the remote to be sensed by the tv from 10 feet away.  All very disappointing, but at least I have the cable company remote, so I don't have to bother with the one that came in the box.  Right - until after an hour of trying to figure it out, searching online and finally talking to a cable company representative all to no avail.  Then, I called the company.  None of their products work with universal remotes!  (so even if you ended up losing the remote in time, you're going to have to get one directly from them)  That's three strikes, and it's back to Amazon with this TV!", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hard to see", "Author": "pedro", "ReviewID": "R1KK031JACL1N0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I wanted to replace my old TV with a flat screen.

The USB and SD storage slots do not work at all.  The DVD can function for photos, MP3 and TIVO-type recorded programming.  It is unfortunate that it is not fully functional.  No wonder it was so deeply discounted.  The options for 12V systems are very limited, so as a 12V TV it is awesome.  Additional advertised functionality does not work on this 19\" model.

I was looking to replace a CRT/DVD combo with an LED/DVD set.  The old set is heavy and bulky, but the quality of the set surpasses that of the NAXA NTD-1954.As mentioned in other reviews, there are issues with both how this set is advertised and how it performs:- the picture quality is 480p, the low end of HD, not the 1080i listed in the Technical Specifications;- NAXA (my first experience with this \"no-name\" manufacturer from China) makes the most of the (lack of)quality control specifications that allow for a certain number of dead and stuck pixels.  The brightly colored \"spots\" in the picture are distracting at best; and- the sound quality is that of an inexpensive laptop.I would not buy this set again.", "Date": "September 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "The picture was terrible", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2BGT7R3I8RH5X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Shipping and packaging was great.  It arrived on time.  Mechanically it worked fine, but the picture quality was so bad that it was often hard to even see what was on the screen.  I'm sure I just ended up with a defective screen.  Nothing about screen problems was mentioned in the reviews I read before purchasing this one.  Amazon was terrific.  I was traveling when I called them, I'd purchased this set for my RV and I was in the first two weeks of a four moth trip when I called them.  They refunded my money before I returned it, because I explained to them I needed to order and receive a new TV so I'd have a box to return this set in.  I ordered a 22\" Naxa instead of another 19\".  It arrived at my next stop and I returned the the 19\".  The 22\" is the same TV only slightly larger.
