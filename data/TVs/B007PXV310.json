The choice was between this one and a Philips that had some good reviews. When I went to the store, I expected to buy the Philips, but this one seemed to have a better picture.As with all flat tv's the sound leaves something to be desired.  But I have a Samsung in the other room that has the same issues.  Quite simply you need to connect a sound bar or external stereo to any flat tv to get great sound.As for the picture, at first it was fine, then I played with the settings and put the picture in Dynamic mode and now the picture really POPS!  I guess the energy saver mode that it starts out in really brings things down.  It also performs really well with PS3 HD games, the 120Hz refresh rate really keeps \"tracing\" to a minimum during action scenes or while watching sports.Overall, it's a great value TV, nothing fancy, it does what it's supposed to.I'm very satisfied!", "Date": "August 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Strictly a Video Monitor, No Audio Out", "Author": "D. COSTA", "ReviewID": "R27K7IVSS7W3DE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The picture quality of this unit is terrific when using the HDMI inputs available. The sound is terrible as others have stated and I would add, worst than most flat screens. In purchasing this unit I overlooked the fact that this Coby does not have any digital or analogue audio outputs to enable a work-around for this major \"sound\" drawback. I have purchased a \"vizio\" sound-bar to make up for the audio, but am forced to use my \"audio out\" from my cable box to push the audio through. This requires the cable box to be locate near the sound-bar which I have wall mounted under the TV. This also means that any other \"video\" device must have its out put directly to an alternative sound device if audio is important to you. For Music, Gaming, and Movies this is a must.For now I use this unit in a bedroom so the logistics work for me. I will most likely use it as a computer monitor when one fails in my office. In the end You get a good quality \"Monitor\" for the money, but it has little versatility as anything else. I would recommend this unit for a bedroom or office for use with a PC or game station with separate audio capabilities. Do not think that the sound quality is something that you will be able to live with. You will be disappointed.", "Date": "October 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Value!", "Author": "S.

It was very easy to set up to the PC, and I was pleased with the bright, clear color. The best thing about it is the size. I do not see well, and I am thrilled with how easy it is to see things on this monitor. I do lots of editing, and this is definitely going to make my life easier.

Too be quite honest, Coby has been a brand I have not had much luck when it comes to smaller electronics such as portable DVD players, digital photo frames and MP3 players, but this is the second television we posses by Coby and there are no complaints.The picture screen measures 31 \u00bd inches diagonally from corner to corner.  It is not the thinnest LCD 32\" television we have, but it sure is the lightest.  The only negative feature I can comment about is the actual stand.  The TV does not sit very stable on it - wobbles side to side.  I am not worried it will tip over, but the base could have been made a bit sturdier in my opinion.  However, it can be hung on a wall using a wall mount that is VESA standard 200mm x 200mm.For inputs it includes 1 component video, 1 composite, 3 HDMI and 1 PC.For a bedroom or small living room, this television is perfect.

At this point I am keeping the tv as is because I only notice that pixel in certain situations and when I go look at it, but remote works, and you can forget about that screen flaw while getting immersed in a movie.So I think you cannot have 100% quality for a $240 full 1080p hd tv with 120hz refresh ratio; for me I had to chose whether to live without remote control (not an option) or having a small screen factory defect that to me is not worth paying $400 more to get the same 32\" full hd from Samsung. And I know I don't want a 720p HD with just 60hz that would leave trail in high speed movement, I much rather compromise with the small pixel. In that sense, the specs of the Cob y are really great (in only the screen or remote sensor worked fine)If you decide to purchase this tv be prepared to inspect it thoroughly and know that you may have to either return it or compromise. Also, don't forget to add the 3year extended warranty you can buy separately from Amazon as well, I am sure I will be calling the warranty guys in a year or so. At least, I am covered for 3 years.In any case, Amazon was absolutely wonderful with their policy. I give Amazon 5stars.Just as a note, some reviews say that the screw to attach the base is missing, I don't know if that is totally accurate, but I can tell you in advance that the screw comes screwed to the TV post base, that you need to take it off before putting the base (sandwiched between tv and screw) and screw it back on. The screw does not come loose anywhere on the package, look at the base of the TV.

I'm on the phone with Customer Service now, and so far, I've been reminded (hate how it's only once something's gone bad that you remember the guarantee on it was comparable to the newly-perceived quality...) that there's only a 90 day full product warranty. The first agent that I spoke with told me that I could take it to a local repair shop, and have them figure out what the problem is, and what part needs replacement, but that I'd have to cover the cost of labor, and wait for the part to be shipped. I asked to speak to a supervisor, and the agent put me on hold. When the original agent picked the phone back up, he offered to extend the full warranty, but explained that I would have to pay to ship the TV back to them, as well as enclose a $30 money order to cover the costs to ship the new replacement TV back to me. This was all after calling multiple times within their stated business hours Saturday, but getting no answer, then hearing a message saying that they're closed, and to call back during normal business hours (which, again, I was), or that I could leave a message, which I then found wasn't possible as their voicemail box was full.The TV has a beautiful, vibrant image, which I'm really missing, now that I have my older Sharp LCD back in place, but I really do, now, find myself questioning how much of a value this TV really is if it's dead after only 99 days of use (I was on vacation for twelve days recently, so, out of my 111 days of ownership, it's been actively used only nine days in excess of the duration of their full warranty). At this point, I just feel bad if my previously glowing review has encouraged anyone out there to buy this TV, as I feel my encouragement could put others at risk of spending your hard-earned money on a product that might very well not be worth it. At this point, I'm not sure whether or not I'm willing to dish out for shipping costs on this TV, since I just don't know how much I trust Coby and their products now...* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *When I write anything (reviews, emails, text messages), I aim to be as thorough as possible, which, honestly, ends up making my writings pretty long and verbose. In considering exactly what to write on this Coby TV, though, it's pretty cut and dry for me: the picture quality on this TV is top-notch for what you're getting in this (and an even higher!) price range, but the sound is simply abysmal, which is why I deducted a star.At its price, this Coby TV is a great choice if you happen to be in the market for either a really big computer monitor, or a smaller-size TV, AND you happen to have an external audio source. In my case, I'm fortunate enough to fit all of those requirements. So, in light of that, this TV works perfectly with my current entertainment system's setup. The picture comes through unquestionably as HD from all of my external media that are connected via HDMI, and said picture is sharp, and as clear as the best that I've seen out there. The AV signal that comes to this Coby TV via my coaxial cable (through which I receive simple basic cable) is, obviously, NOT HD, but it still delivers a pretty clear picture even from that substandard connection.I had previously had a 32\" flat screen Sharp TV (whose model # and specific details I don't recall right now, but I'll be sure to update my review with them) connected to my entertainment system, and it IS a good TV, but the color quality and image on THIS TV is GREAT! The only other high quality image that I had at my regular, personal disposal to compare image quality to previously was what I see on my current computer monitor as transmitted via my video card. That image is sharp, clear, and brightly colored (thanks to a quality computer monitor, for color production). This Coby, when I'm watching anything via my Xbox 360, for instance, leaves nothing to be desired for me in the sharpness and color saturation of the produced images... Really, I'm being redundant here because the picture really IS great from this Coby, and it just makes me want to wax poetic on it (but, I'm NOT a poet, so... )!As stated before, the only place that this Coby falls short IS the sound. As another reviewer stated, it DOES sound abysmally like it's being routed through an old-fashioned radio. The sound produced by this TV is hollow-sounding, and, really, it's just pretty crappy, to put it bluntly. Anyone that doesn't have an alternate speaker system to route this TV's sound through won't be able to deal with it long-term, I am positive. Truly, think of the worst-quality sound that you've been subjected to in the recent past. Now imagine what that would sound like if it was five times worse. That's at LEAST as bad as this Coby's audio quality, but the audio quality from this Coby TV, even still, might just be even worse than that! It really IS that bad! So, again, if you happen to have an external sound system with a receiver, you won't have to worry about that, since your audio will be routed elsewhere, but if you're relying on this Coby's speakers as your sole sound source, just don't even bother with this TV.In my case, the only issue that I've encountered really is the fault of my receiver's manufacturer; out of, easily, 45 different TV manufacturers (and I would bet money that it's more like 65 different ones), my Onkyo receiver does not accommodate Coby TVs regarding its universal remote. Really, it's not a big deal that I'm stuck keeping the Coby remote around to turn the TV on and off, and to switch the input to the one I've currently got selected, but, for me, it IS still an annoyance...Long story short, I feel that, for all of the connections that this TV offers, and the image quality that it presents, it's really very well-priced in comparison with its competitors. Unless you have prior experience with a given manufacturer, you really don't have any way of knowing if what you buy that's made by them will be worth the money that you've paid for said product. This being my first Coby TV, I can confidently say that the image that I am enjoying from this TV is right up there with its better-known competitors. The sound, however, is going to be this TV's downfall for anyone without an external audio source to connect it to.Hope this helps! Happy shopping!*UPDATE* Regarding the remote, mine never quite worked right, and it DID become enough of an annoyance for me (and Onkyo really was no help in giving me codes to get this Coby to work with my Receiver's remote), that I opted to go out and pick up a new universal remote. I ended up going with the Logitech Harmony 300 Remote Control 915-000143. Setting that remote up was a bit of a trial, as MyHarmony does NOT currently have an active code for THIS specific model, were you to type in this TV's model number, but they DO have a code for the Coby TF-TV3227 that DID finally control my TV on my new Logitech universal remote, so if you opt to use a Logitech Harmony remote to control your A/V equipment, try putting THAT model number in the MyLogitech field instead, and hopefully it'll work for you, too...", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Garbage", "Author": "sb D \"S.

Digital channels are available only after you've gone through the analog channels.  On our other TVs, the digital channels are mixed in with the analog.  (For instance, our analog ABC station is channel 6 and channel 6-1 is the digital version of the same station.) I have attempted to correct/change this, but have not been successful. I am probably overlooking something that may be obvious to others.The picture is not nearly as good as our Vizio, but my husband thinks it could improve with a new cable.  When my son was home from college, he played Xbox on this TV and was pleasantly surprised by the picture quality.  (He used RCA instead of HDMI hookup.) The sound is a bit tinny, but not too bad. The HDMI and RCA hookup is on the side, which is quite convenient. The cable hookup is on the back of the TV, but does not protrude.  Much like a computer monitor's plug, it faces down and is recessed. This makes for much better cord control. The TV is somewhat thick for a flat panel, but feels fairly solidly built. The weight is typical for a 32 inch. Base was quite easy to attach and it is possible to mount the TV, though I would purchase the TV before the mount to determine what type might be best.  I do not think all mount types would work.The remote is different than any I've seen. Button placement is quite awkward and hard to read. It's not my favorite, but there is a sleep timer - which is more than I can say for my TCL TV remote.Overall, I would recommend this TV if your expectations are not extremely high for sound and video quality.

Yes, it's a bad TV as everyone says, but as a PC Monitor, I found it completely unusable.  I know how to change display resolutions and refresh rates on my computer, but I could not find a combination that was compatible with the TFTV3247.  On boot up I could see BIOS messages, but as soon as Windows launched there was no display.  In addition to various resolutions and refresh rates, I also tried Window's Safe Mode and Window's VGA mode.  I was never able to see a display.  To make things worse, Coby's Tech Support is equally useless.  With most monitors, the manual provides a list of usable resolutions and refresh rates.  This manual doesn't, so I called Tech Support.  Coby does not provide their Tech Support team with this information.  They told me to call the maker of my graphics card!!!!  Simple logic... if Coby can't tell me about Coby products, what do they think the graphics card maker can tell me about Coby products?  I persisted and finally reached the Tech Support manager named 'Migel' and discovered why his team is so rude.  Migel is rude.

In fact adjusting the resolution in Windows 7  states that 1280 x 720 is the \"Recommended setting\". With that noted, if you want to know more about the PC Monitor experiment read more below.As a TVAs with most TV's the factory settings need adjustment but there are enough presets to go through, and adjusting them will help get a balanced setting. The menu items are straight forward using the controller to adjust the changes.The one thing I found lacking was the 120Hz performance. As good as the broadcasts look, watching sports didn't appear to benefit from it. I could see ghosting and blurring as I would see on a standard 60Hz TV set. I looked at several different sports channels and couldn't see that any of the broadcasts benefited with the 120Hz feature.With that noted, the picture quality is about as good or better as one could expect from a similar priced 60Hz TV.Solid blacks and good support of mid tones and color make for some pretty nice viewing.For Console GamingThis TV is real nice for gaming. I attached the XBox 360 and ran several games. Great color and sharpness in all games tested with great response time.For PC MonitorMost important to note - You need to disable Overscan in the Picture/Advanced Video Options to get your desktop to fit.Using the HDMI out from my PC, the Colby does an OK job in the 32bit color department. I'll state right here that I would NOT use this to edit pictures in Photoshop. Its probably a combination of low color gamut and at 32 inches, the colors in images  start to band - almost like looking at a Gif where you can note bands in color gradients. I'll also note that text is not sharp.If  you're simply going to visit sites, do non graphics work, and game, it fills that bill nicely. Given that its not an advertised featureNow for PC Gaming, note that as a monitor, it has at least a 7Ms or more response time. Not exactly the best response time but workable depending on the games you plan on playing. The other thing is 32 inches is big, you'll need to back away if its on your desk or your peripheral vision advantage will be lost.I attached some pictures showing the Windows 7 Desktop and running Battlefied 3The real downside is seeing others reviews noting the missing base screw. That's what happened to me which required me to find a metric screw that would fit it at Home Depot. That alone takes off one star.3 StarsSo one Star off for having no base screw (as others have mentioned) and another Star off for not performing as I expected it to in 120Hz. Seeing other TVs at 120Hz, the Colby falls well short.SummaryThe saving grace of this TV (for me) is its ability to perform as a good PC monitor (60Hz)using HDMI, something that isn't even advertised. For TV viewing and console gaming platform it holds up very well against similar priced TVs. It was close to 4 Stars but I simply don't see the 120Hz advantage which is the key reason I bought this TV.ProsEven tone and color - edge to edge even at varying viewing anglesNo light bleedGood Variable viewing angleNice blacksEasy intuitive controlsConsMissing the base screw120Hz not notable - blurring and ghosting was present in various sports broadcasts", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "DON'T DO IT!!!!", "Author": "Richard A.
