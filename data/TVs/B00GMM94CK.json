Haier has discount insert for the Roku streaming stick, the flyer says $10, but at checkout the discount is $20. It works very good with fast action sports like live ice hockey off Roku. No problems at all plugging in Roku or hooking up DVD/VHS machine. Picture quality is outstanding, no adjustments needed.", "Date": "February 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice TV, almost five stars", "Author": "David Good", "ReviewID": "R1QTRXHDE284WS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this tv, don't get me wrong. Has great video and looks super. I only have two complaints (so far). First, I understand that with these flat panel displays it's challenging for manufacturers to find a place to put the speakers. Best I can tell they have them pointing directly down from the plastic panel. Unfortunately if you have the TV in say, an old-style entertainment stand, this causes a really tinny echoy sound.I hooked a couple of PC speakers to the headset port and improved the TVs sound dramatically. But for what you pay for an HDTV, you shouldn't have to do this.Second, Haier is offering a discount on a Roku Streaming Stick as a promotion. I'd like to point out this is slightly misleading. The $10 discount is ONLY applicable to the Streaming Stick for MHL - which is some sort of funky mobile version of HDMI. Technically this is nice because MHL carries power so you don't need to hook it up to USB for power.My two problems with this is that first, the MHL streaming stick costs $69, not the $49 of the regular streaming stick - so you're actually not saving money. Even after the $10 discount you're still spending more. Second, if you have another TV that doesn't have this funky new port that no one's ever heard of, well, you're out of luck. Your fancy Roku won't work with it. This coupon code is ONLY applicable to the MHL version so don't be fooled - make sure you know what you're getting if you choose to take advantage of it.If the sound was a teensy bit better and the streaming stick discount was applicable to ANY roku purchase, this would be five stars for sure.Edit 4/3/14:By the way if you bought this TV and the sound changes unexpectedly, check the audio menu and check to see if \"Auto Volume\" is on. If it is, turn it off. This should fix your sound issue.", "Date": "April 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "We love the tv and the price.", "Author": "homeschoolX3", "ReviewID": "R2L1SAL18OTGFY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At $299 this tv  amazing. The picture is superb and it was extremely simple to set up. Basically ready right out of the box. We will probably end up getting a different surround sound or audio bar so the audio quality can match the visual. Overall I am pleased with our purchase.
