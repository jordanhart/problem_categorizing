{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Bought this TV instead of a Samsung or Panasonic - glad I did!", "Author": "Anthony Palombo", "ReviewID": "R2DZU0VATBLU98", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I learned reading reviews about TVs and trying to draw clear conclusions is like trying to find unobtainium. It also seems that in any ratings table, you may see about 5% to 15% of the ratings being 1 and 2 stars no matter what brand or model you are looking at. Then again, 67% of all statistics are made up on the spot.Now here I am add adding one more to the many stories and opinions out there...I paid the $649 price-tag on this TV and saved much $$$ over my initial choice of the Panasonic GT50 (and second choice a comparable new Samsung), and it turned out to be a good move. I already own a 42\" Samsung 1080p plasma for a bedroom, and also have a 2007 42\" Pioneer 720p plasma (remember those?) that still has a fantastic picture. I have this new LG TV for about a month now and it works flawlessly. I looked into this after coming across reviews of the LG PA6500 model. I used the calibration settings found on reviews here for the PA6500 and they worked well on the PN6500. I also bought the Disney WOW disk and that worked well too. The TV has a decent picture using factory pre-set Standard mode, but it was much improved by using the customizable Expert 1 (which also allows use of the built-in Picture Wizard) or Expert 2 modes. I actually used Expert 1 with PA6500 calibration settings and Expert 2 with Disney WOW created settings - couldn't really tell the difference in picture clarity, but there was a small difference in color.I use the Panasonic DMP BDT220 Bluray player and it streams Netflix at 720p without any problems. It works so well I didn't need to use my Roku Netflix player anymore (now I have one less device cluttering up my TV area).This TV shows Netflix HD at 720p really well. I sit 10ft away and the 50\" seems the perfect size TV for me at this distance. Standard definition DVDs are upscaled well and the picture is sharp. Bluray shows a crisp picture. I watch mostly at night in a darkened room, but the TV shows well enough in the daytime with shades drawn closed.Why did I consider this TV over the Samsung, Panasonic, or even a Sony (which I'm told makes Vizio too)?1. Some reviews pointed out the panel lottery that Samsung and Panasonic (and some others) are engaged in. For example, you buy a Samsung and the panel may be made by Sharpe or some unfamiliar-named manufacturer. So reviews on Samsungs/Panasonics/Sonys are supposedly inconsistent because the corresponding panel is not identified. You can search out the other reviews for this info: the various manufacturer panel label codes have been identified. I was convinced enough not to want to chance getting a non-Samsung or non-Panasonic panel when I'm paying for one. Sony is supposed to be a nice set too but I think there is a large premium in the price due to name (like for Samsung and Pansonic too). It was stated LG does not play the panel lottery so all reviews are for the same LG panel - that makes the LG reviews more reliable to me.2. Electronics engineers we've spoken with that are not affiliated with LG mentioned that LG has higher reliability than the other big names. In the store, I was checking out the LGs when the salesperson came over and steered me to the Panasonics saying how great they were, and the Panasonic he was showing me had severe pixel problems, which he stated was a good reason to buy the extended warrantees. How can a problem TV be a selling point for a 'great' TV?? So, I took a leap of faith that maybe the LG was of a more reliable quality.3. I read reviews that my first choice Panasonic GT50 was really difficult to calibrate and that The Geek Squad has only a 50% success rate in dialing it in. I'm not paying hundreds of dollars for a coin-toss chance of having it calibrated properly. The Panasonic Viera TC-P50GT50 shown in Magnolia seemed dull and not that sharp of a picture for the money, and it was a dark room which is where plasma's are supposed to show best. Why go with a reportedly difficult to calibrate TV? And the reviews about Panasonic's burn-in problem? Those are plenty - no thanks.4. If points # 1,2 and 3 above turn out to be bogus, I still have a great-picture and LG's 2 year panel warranty and 1 year parts-n-labor warranty to fall back on. Now that I see the picture quality is really nice, I could chance spending $649/yr for 2 or 3 years on replacement LGs and it would still be cost effective compared to the big name TVs. Do Samsung or Panasonic, or even Sony, really honor their warrantees? I read enough horror story reviews to be convinced they typically don't, or at least don't until after putting the really die-hard persistent 'valued-customers' through much hassle.  And if LG is the same with warrantees, I'd rather be out $650 than $1800 or more. And there are enough bad reviews on Extended Warrantees to make those a gamble as well.So far so good - I have a picture quality that I see is on par with the Samsung/Panasonic for about a third of the price. My Pioneer does show a great picture though, even for a 2007 720p model (used online calibration settings I got from CNET). Overall, the LG picture quality seems to be better than my Samsung plasma (I have a 40\" Samsung 120Hz LCD in the basement, but I found I like plasmas the best because they show dark scenes better and also fast motion better).  This is after calibrating both with Disney WOW, and even when using other online calibration settings for both the Samsung and LG the LG seems to show better.Some (many?) reviews complain about the quality of LG and if my TV craps out or the pictures degrades anytime, I'll be back here for a humble update. And I will seek to get the TV fixed under warranty and if not successful I may even buy the same again to see if my luck changes. See, in the end this TV game is all about taking chances anyway, and for me the less costly chances are the better risk.", "Date": "May 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Gorgeous, gorgeous picture....puts you right in the movie.", "Author": "T Boyer \"seattleparent\"", "ReviewID": "R1P4TQVUK2TQBH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought it elsewhere because the price was lower than Amazon at the time (though now Amazon's prices have come down too). The professional reviews said this is pretty close to state of the art plasma for a super low price, and I agree. No hitches at all, adjusting picture settings was easy, and the picture is just incredibly gorgeous. Movies look the way they were intended to look -- the color is even more true than the typical movie theater projection system. Motion is handled really well -- no soap opera effect.Here are some decision points to consider:1) If you have a room with good light control, such as a basement den, this TV (plasma with a clear glass screen) is great. If you have an upstairs room with ambient light, this might not be your TV. You probably want LED for more brightness, and a non-glare screen.2) If you want your colors super warm and vivid, then then LED is maybe a better choice. If you want natural, true, accurate color, this TV is about as good as you can find at any price.3) If you want smart TV features or lots of HDMI ports (this model only has two), this is not your model. If you want pretty close to state of the art plasma picture quality for a great price, this is a super choice. We overcame the lack of HDMI ports with an inexpensive HDMI switch.", "Date": "July 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phenomenal Picture", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2KS68SZQDJR4N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This LG TV was an upgrade from our 42\" HDTV.  It set up within minutes and requires minimal tinkering to begin enjoying your television.  The size upgrade alone was obviously imposing, but the picture is amazing.  Between you and me, I think I prefer this TV to the LED Cinema TV dominating our family room.  This is probably a matter of taste, but the picture on this set is slightly sharper. I simply can't say enough about how real the images appear on anything I've chosen to watch.  I will say, I won't be using the ECO-Friendly display.  It is simply too dark to make viewing enjoyable.  It's a wasted feature on this set where a vivid picture is the major draw.I love the way this TV looks even when it is off.  LG doesn't muddle the aesthetics with casing and framing.  The result is a beautifully streamlined display which is 98% screen. It doesn't come with the bells and whistles of other TVs, WIFI for example.  With only 2 HDMI inputs and 2 gamers in the house, this can be inconvenient.  This may not be a consideration for some. The remote is also pretty standard. The sound is near worthless without the use of additional speakers.  Though the sound is clear and undistorted, it doesn't get loud or make much of an impact without assistance.This TV is obviously designed for someone looking for a superior picture at a decent price point, and if that's you, I can recommend this TV whole-heartedly.", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG Electronics 50PN6500 Plasma TV", "Author": "lil \"lil\"", "ReviewID": "RVWDBO28T2GOI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start by stating that overall I really love this TV. The picture is absolutely stunning. More on that later.There are some minor (at least to me) things that I don't like so I will cover those first. During the initial setup the TV got stuck on trying to search channels on the coax connection even though I had nothing connected to it. It took me awhile to figure out that it was stuck. I had to break out of the setup and go about the menu to finish it. Since it seems to recognize the HDMI connections I would have expected it to know that nothing was connected to the coax input. Oh well. And it would be nice to have more than the 2 HDMI connections but it's not that big of a deal to get a switcher to add more inputs. My final critique is just a general issue with any plasma tv - any light source that is opposite the tv will reflect in the picture. In our case we have a huge picture window that reflects. Obviously you can move the tv elsewhere or like us we just bought some heavy curtains to block the outside light when watching during the day.I love the ease of use of the settings on these tv. You get a nice menu with icons so there is no mistaking what to click on. There is also an input button which allows you to change the input source, however, it also recognizes if you put DVD in your player and will ask you if you want to change to it. Very nice. For picture modes, I have not tried to do anything custom even though you are allowed to do something. I haven't found any need to. The available settings works just fine for me. I generally leave it in \"Standard\" mode for tv, but my favorite is \"Cinema\", especially when playing Blu-ray DVD's. As I stated previously, the picture is stunning in all modes. I love the deep, deep blacks and movie action scenes are awesome. As with the picture, the audio settings are easy to use. I quickly made a custom one with the bass enhanced to sound good with my sound bar. I would characterize the internal speakers as adequate but I usually use the external sound bar. I have not tried the USB connector yet but it's at least available if I ever decide to copy a bunch of movies to my external hard drive.I also wanted to comment on the slenderness of this tv. It's very, very slim for a plasma tv. I had not realized that it would be until we unpacked it and set it up. Very pleasing. And my wife loves the fact the housing itself is not very big either.Really, overall this tv shines.", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "MAYBE THE BEST LOW-END TV YOU'LL BUY THIS YEAR!", "Author": "Haze Blackmon \"TheInsatiableBookReader\"", "ReviewID": "R2GWVPKZWCSJZN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this really awesome plasma tv set up for about 6 hours now and used it, so far, for Blu-Ray(watched Gangster Squad), played an hour of the PS3 game Dead Island: Riptide and have fiddled around with cable(mostly news channels). For a plasma this size and it being 1080p it's a lotta bang for the buck. It took some playing around with the various settings to get picture and sound where I want them. Once I got it where I want the picture is nothing short of amazing, especially Blu-Ray! Even cable looks really good. I don't have high-def cable, it's just standard stuff, but it is really crisp and clear. The sound on this LG model is very good, though some will still want an external sound system. Me, I'm fine with the sound. I cranked up Gangster Squad and it hurt my ears. Of course, this LG is in a 12x15 room, so I don't know how the sound would be in a massive room. I suspect it would still be quite audible.The only drawbacks I've noticed was when I was playing Dead Island: Riptide on my Playstation 3 and the black levels(in general). The framerate of Dead Island dropped quite a bit at times and there was some juddering. However, I don't know whether this was a game issue or the tv. Most low-end plasmas are not the best option to play a video game on. The graphics though looks beautiful on Dead Island. As far as the black levels, this is just me being nit-picky. They are really just average and this is to be expected with cheaper plasmas. I was just hoping this year they would have deeper black levels on these models since LG really increased picture quality this year(actually over the last two years there's been a big increase in pic quality). Yes, some people will bemoan the fact that this isn't a 3D television and that it isn't a Smart TV, but that's really a non-issue for me. I rarely use Smart TV and 3D I use maybe once a month(I have a 47 inch 3D LG I bought in August 2011 for that purpose). The side viewing angles are just like other plasmas - perfect! You won't find that with LCD/LED tv's.The bottom line is if you're in the market for a television and don't have a big budget, then this is defintely one that should be at the top of your list. Price, picture, sound, looks of the tv(it's a beauty), installing the stand, setup of the tv, and plenty of hdmi inputs all make this a serious contender this year in the plasma tv market. I suspect this one will be a hot seller! Again, if you're not into all the fancy features of the high-end models, and Smart TV and 3D aren't a necessity, then you've found yourself a great television.

At the time of this review, Amazon is selling it for $649.00 with free shipping. This is very competitively priced for a 50-inch, 1080p television, especially from a major brand like LG. Some other words you might notice are things like \"Plasma\" and \"600 Hz\" which I will try to help explain if you're not already familiar. Below is my FAQ and review, if you have any other questions, please post in the comments and I'll try to help out to be the best of my ability.01. How is the picture quality?Fantastic. Depending on which Blu Ray you pop in, you may feel like you're watching a movie in hyper reality. Like you're IN the movie. The characters flow across the screen in such perfect refresh rates that it truly trippy to behold. I don't think it's the absolute BEST image I've ever seen on an 1080p television, but I'm VERY impressed. Not even the snobbiest HD expert can give too harsh of a rating in regards to the picture quality.02. Will I need to fiddle with any of the picture settings or will it look good right out of the box?The default image setting is some kind of \"eco-friendly\" mode which is slightly darker than usual. Kinda like when you unplug your laptop and the screen dims a bit. So NO, out of the box the image isn't right. The good news is that they include some cool picture presets such as \"Game\" and \"Cinema\" which are much better. Right now I keep mine on \"Cinema\" which is very crisp and just about always looks right. You can also adjust every little individual setting (brightness, contrast, etc) if you desire.03. OK, but I thought 3D and LED TVs were the new rage. Isn't PLASMA outdated?Yes and no. PLASMA used to have issues with images being \"burnt\" into the screen, but those problems have been fixed. In fact, the evolution of Plasma has come along amazingly well. Some people even argue that it gives the most \"natural\" look. However, in my opinion, LED is definitely superior in regards to overall picture quality, especially when it comes to black levels. Still, not every LED TV is created equal. I've seen plenty whose picture was much better than this TV. I've also seen some that look much worse. LEDs do tend to last longer and are even thinner than Plasma, but right now I don't think they're necessarily superior by definition. It depends on the TV. 3D is also a format that is not going away, and if you're in to that, the lack-of-3D capability may be a disappointment in regards to this TV.04. What about 4K TVs?Sony will be rolling out its first wave of 4K televisions this year - here's one: Sony XBR-55X900A 55-Inch 1080p 120Hz 3D LED 4K Ultra HDTV - so I don't actually know how the picture quality will look since I haven't seen one yet. In theory, 4k televisions have some 4x the resolution of 1080p. Some say that the naked eye really can't tell the difference though, unless you have a HUGE screen (like 100 inches) or if you're sitting inches from the screen. I think that there will probably be a noticeable difference between 4K and 1080p, but it will most likely be another 5-10 years before the price of these TVs are reasonable. Still, the Blu Ray Disc Association already announced that it has plans on updating the Blu Ray disc format to support 4k resolution. 4K is definitely coming, but I wouldn't worry about it too much yet.05. How difficult is setup? Will I need a professional to help me?Set-up is a breeze so long as you're just sitting the TV on a table or something. I was able to do it by myself. If you're mounting it on a wall, however, I would definitely recommend having someone help you who knows what they're doing. It doesn't have to be a \"professional\" exactly, but you don't want to mess up your wall by doing it wrong.06. I see I can plug my USB drive into this TV. That's cool. What all file formats can it play?So far I've found that it can only play music files such as mp3s and picture files such a jpegs. Kinda cool I guess, but actually disappointing for me. I would like to play video files or music in a lossless format. Fortunately most Blu Ray players now play a wider variety of file formats so you can still play digital media on your TV.07. How is the sound quality? Will I need to purchase surround sound speakers?Although I would never recommend an HD television without surround sound, I can actually say that I'm very impressed with the television speakers themselves. There is absolutely no distortion, even at high bass levels, and voices are crisp and clear.08. How is the glare?The screen is very reflective so you'll want to position it away from windows if possible. Windows on the side or behind the TV shouldn't create much of a problem, and artificial lighting hasn't caused any issues for me. It all depends on placement though, because the screen does have a mirror-like reflection to it.09. What's 600Hz mean? Will I be able to tell the difference between 60 Hz or 120Hz?In theory, 600Hz is the \"refresh rate\" or number of times a still image is refreshed in one second. So, 60Hz = 60 times per second and 600Hz = 600 times per second. A pretty extraordinary difference as far as numbers are concerned, but even the really picky tend to agree that it's hard to discern between 120Hz and 600Hz, except maybe when it comes to sports when you do tend to see some motion blur. CNET calls the Hz rate a \"spec to ignore\" because the typical eye can't tell the difference between 60 and 600. I agree that you shouldn't buy a TV solely on the refresh rate, but I believe you can tell a difference, especially between 60 VS 600. The image seems much smoother to me on this TV than those with lower Hz. Probably not a major difference, but the fact that this TV has the highest Hz rate in the market is just another reason to love it.10. I'm nervous about ordering expensive electronics online. What if it arrives damaged?I'm not sure if Amazon ships all televisions the same way, but I was able to set-up an appointment for delivery with the delivery company and they were very professional and courteous. Everything arrived in perfect shape. In my experience with Amazon customer service, you can always buy confidently from them because they're very helpful.11. Would YOU buy it?Good question. It should be noted that I received this system to test via the Amazon.com VINE program so I didn't actually have to pay for it. Now that I've experienced all the pleasure and wonder of its picture quality, would I actually pay $700ish for it? It's hard to say.I would be VERY tempted to go for an LED TV instead, because they are definitely the future format, but at the same time, I have absolutely no complaints about the picture quality of this Plasma screen - and it's very affordable. I'm also tempted by 3D TVs even though the 3D format doesn't excite me too much. There is definitely something cool about being able to watch a 3D movie right at home. Knowing me, I would most likely opt for the latest greatest (an LED 3D TV) but for the price, I can definitely back this TV up with a full-hearted recommendation. It doesn't have all the latest bells and whistles, but it is affordable and looks AMAZING.

My main TV is a 58\" Samsung Plasma That I purchased a few years ago for a lot more money than this one.One of the things I wanted in a new TV was Wi-Fi, but I didn't want to pay a lot of money. Fortunately, I got some advice from a local dealer who said to pick a cheaper TV that had good picture quality, then buy a Blu-ray player with Wi-Fi and save yourself a ton of money.I took his advice and found this TV. I have to say, after a few tweaks to the picture settings, this TV produces a very beautiful, crisp picture! I love it almost as much as my main TV and have spent quite a bit of time watching TV and movies on this over my other.The only minor problem I have with this TV is that it has a glossy finish and not a matted finish. This is something I missed while searching for a TV, so I'm not taking points off of the review. Sadly, it's in a very sunny room, with lots of windows, so during the day, there's quite a bit of glare and reflection from the windows. The black levels also wash out a bit on really bright days. Still, in the evening and at night, or if you are planning to place this in a dark room, this TV is awesome, especially for the price!One quick note is that it only has 2 HDMI slots, so if you have more than two HDMI devices to hook up to it, you might want to plan on getting a HDMI Switch Box. I planned ahead for this and just use one to switch between the Blu-ray player and the Xbox360 that's hooked up to it without any issues.I would definitely recommend this TV to others!!", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "For the price this is a very nice TV", "Author": "G. Ware", "ReviewID": "R10B82CARYZF8W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first plasma TV and so far I am satisfied.  Prior to this LG the only other flat screen TV's that I have had are LCD's by Sharp, Panasonic, and Samsung.  To start off the review I will focus a little on the delivery by Amazon.  The TV was delivered by Ceva and they did a good job.  I did not have them setup the TV, though that is part of their service.  The delivery company called to schedule the TV and gave me a four-hour window that they would deliver it within.  That is kind of a wide window but I got lucky and I must have been first on the list as Ceva actually showed up 20 mins before the delivery window started.  The delivery drivers brought the TV up to a spare bedroom on the 2nd floor, which was nice as the TV box is heavy.  For the 2nd part of the review I will focus in on the TV itself.  Unboxing and setup was straightforward.  It may take two people to lift the TV out of the box, depending on your lifting ability.  Setting the TV up on the stand was easy and requires 2 screws to secure it to the stand and it feels steady after it was setup.  I like the stand for the TV as it is sturdy and allows the TV to swivel.  The TV itself is very nice looking, I like the thin black frame of the TV.  The TV looks very good in a room on a TV stand.  The TV is very thin and could easily be hooked up to a wall mount.  The 50-inch is a good size for small to medium rooms.  Setup of the TV settings is easy and the user interface reminds me of my older Samsung.  There are easy option settings for picture, audio, channel, and input.  There are enough settings available to fine-tune the picture to your desire.  Out of the box the picture is not that great and will require time to experiment with settings to get it to the way you will like it.  The \"eco\" mode that is default picture settings is designed to save energy but it makes the picture too dark.  I set mine to standard picture setting and modified some of the settings to get the picture to a look that meets my needs.  Be patient with this process, for any TV, as it can take some time to find the right settings that work for you.  I'm still adjusting mine to bring the picture to my preferred look.  I am using this TV mostly for video gaming, Apple TV movies, and over the air digital TV.  I don't have my satellite hooked up to this TV.  The over the air digital TV looks good when on the HD channels, the non-HD channels look good enough.  At the higher resolution hdmi inputs like Xbox, PlayStation, and Apple TV, the TV picture is very good.  The picture is clear and colors are good (although black is sometimes a bit light for my tastes).  For a gaming TV this plasma works well.  The colors are rich and the speed of the TV makes the gaming smooth.  For the price of this TV and the size of the TV, it is a very good value.  LG has put together a very nice TV at a very attractive price point and that combination make it a very compelling option.  LCD's and LED's are much more expensive at this size screen.  This TV does not come with all the bells and whistles as more expensive TV's but for the price who needs all that extra stuff.Pros-1. Price- great price for this size TV from a well-known brand.2. Picture- very good for price.3. Size- good size for small and medium rooms.4. Look of TV- very attractive looking and will compliment or enhance any room.5. Sound- for a thin TV the sound is better than other brands I have had. The sound isn't stereo quality but for a thin TV the voice can be heard and that is a plus.  Other flat screen TV's I have had it is difficult to hear the person talk so I had to buy a sound bar.  For what I use this TV for I don't think a sound bar is needed.  If this is your main TV additional sound might be needed but for every day use it is adequate.Con-1. Only two hdmi inputs- for the price maybe it is ok but 2 hdmi inputs is not enough on a modern TV. Just hook up your cable and one game machine and you are out of hdmi ports.  If you have more than two hdmi connections you will have to purchase an hdmi switch/hub so that you can connect more than one.

I ordered the TV without seeing Adorama was the seller, and assumed I was backed by the Amazon return policy.When the TV arrived, it was defective out of the box. The screen quality was poor and it flickered quite a bit. It was nothing like what I saw in the store. So, I began the process to return. I was shocked to learn that Adorama does not take TV's back above 47\", which makes no sense. I emailed them about this, then called Amazon who then emailed them on my behalf to send return instructions, and Adorama replied to what was a few emails with the same response pretty much telling me I was screwed and to call LG. That's not the point. It's defective, and I've opted to purchase another TV by LG so I have a TV after waiting so long.Adorama doesn't seem to care, and after reading a plethora of consumer reviews on other sites, it looks like Adorama is a poor operation with terrible customer service. I have sent the TV back at Amazon's direction and have filed an A-Z claim.

I had been searching for a new TV for about 4-5 months and was hesitant to get a plasma over an LED, but after reading numerous reviews, plasmas were the way to go, and I felt this was the best bang for the buck.The picture quality is excellent, the setup is easy, and I don't notice any lag when playing video games.  Blu Rays, and especially animated Blu Rays, look absolutely amazing.  The sound seemed pretty good when I tried it but almost immediately after hooking up the TV, I hooked up my surround sound system, so I don't have a great testimonial for the audio.It doesn't have all the bells and whistles (3D and Smart) but most people will already have a device that can stream Netflix, Hulu, etc., and I heard people who have 3D capabilities rarely use them.  If you don't have a streaming device, you can get a Roku player for pretty cheap.  I did want a 3D TV (I have one movie in 3D and a PS3) but there is no way of getting a 3D TV without smart capabilities, and it would have costed at least an extra $300.  This is why this TV was the best fit for me.  It was in my budget, and I felt I really didn't NEED the 3D.  I maybe for my next TV though.Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase.

Plasma tvs remind me of the old CRTs, it even has the glass screen that reflects everything (don't put it in a bright room, its great in the basement).  I have noticed that images will tend to burn in, like if you leave the xbox on single screen for a while or a dvd player.  But you can't even notice it really, and it completely goes away after a while.  I would say if money is no object, go with a Sony lcd.  But for the price, this tv is ridiculously awesome.  Another note about the TV, I wasn't sure if it would produce Dolby 5.1 from the digital optical out, but it does.  I have a Sony BDP-1100 plugged into this tv via hdmi, and use the digital optical out to go to an older Tecnics A/V receiver that does not have hdmi inputs.

It's still \"behind\" the screen - it's tucked in a few inches - just facing wrong to keep cabling consistent.

None of the flashlight or clouding problems seen in some LCDs costing hundreds more (I played the Samsung lottery 2 years ago). Minor screen door effect on some inputs if viewed at < 10 feet from the screen. No buzzing or weird audio problems. Stock sound is also great, one of the better ones I've heard. Power consumption is less than my 42\" LG LCD, and heat is not a concern, even after 10-12 hours of continuous use. I played Gears of War 3 online for almost 3 hours (\"Horde\"), and it looked like an image had set in. But after playing a looping full-screen movie for 12 hours after that, it was nothing to worry about.This 2013 50\" model is similar to the 50PA5500 from last year, but with some notable options taken away. The PN6500 only has 2 HDMI ports, the 2012 model has 3...this one does NOT play movies via USB, the older model does - which is a nice feature to have without relying on a separate box/remote to hassle with. But the worst part is the menu. There was an option to see the firmware and hours on the older LG plasmas by using the red button to take you into the service menu (menu or home - red button). My 2011 LG 42\" LCD had this, too. Maybe it's still there, but I could not find it. There's an anti-image burn setting, it's under Option - ISM Method, but no mention of it in the manual. The remote is fine, very small and not accurate - it's not the best but also far from the worst. The 2011 LG remote I had also worked on this one. What drove me crazy is that if I'm watching Netflix on Xbox, and switch to the tv, and switched back to Netflix, I'd get an 'Output protection error' and the app would crash. I think this might be due to the HDMI cable, but the other cable I used put artifacts all over the movie. Oh well. Just keep in mind you might want to upgrade HDMI cables or experiment with different ones.This is a great plasma, outside of the feature set and limited menu. Blacks look really black in the movies I watched. I played Arkham Asylum on Xbox for a bit and it looked great. The game had some flickering on loading screens which I've been told is normal for plasmas.  I also watched an NHL game, and it looked awesome. I'm about 100 hours into the initial burn-in but I'm debating returning it. The price  of this is currently a little too considering this is an entry-level model, although LG used to sell 720p sets a year or two ago in this model's  place. I'm probably going to replace it with a Sony KDL-50R550, which is more expensive, but I want the best 50\" I can buy for under $1000. Or I might just keep both.

My husband had a pretty easy time unpacking and placing the tv on its stand (12 year old son helped!), the packaging was excellent. This tv also has great sound, we had external speakers set up for the tv this one is replacing, but we put them away for now, that's how good this tv sounds, which was a pleasant surprise.The set up is also easy, the remote makes it easy to navigate to the different set ups for picture and sound. We generally use the standard setting, there are several settings: standard, cinema, eco, game, photo, 2 \"expert\" settings (you can adjust these to your own specifications)and vivid. The picture wizard allows you to set the expert settings with ease and confidence, guiding you through with suggestions. Two settings will allow you to have a night and day setting, if needed. I watched the movie The Descendants on the cinema setting one evening, which is full of gorgeous scenery (Hawaii) and music, and really felt my \"movie at home\" experience was elevated from the usual.The extra HDMI outlet is easy to access. We plugged in our NeoTV streaming device to watch YouTube and Netflix, and switching back and forth between HDMI outlets is also fairly simple. This is a basic tv set, as far as extras go, (not a Smart tv) but still (in my opinion) more than adequate and easy to learn how to use pretty quickly.I think maybe my only complaint is about using the remote (manufacturer's or our in home tv remote). It just isn't as sensitive to the remotes/tvs we've had before. You really have to thoughtfully aim it at the tv's lower left hand corner for it to work, whereas, most tvs, even much older ones, we could aim the remote at the ceiling or the wall behind us and it would work. But that's pretty petty, considering what a great deal this tv is(and because most of the time, I'm changing the channel from the cable box, so it is mostly using tv volume and on/off when I am aiming at the tv).

I own a variety of flat-panel TV's in both plasma and LCD.  Honestly, they all look good to me.  This LG is no different.  I was looking for a 50\" TV that was realtively slim at an affordable price.  This fits what I am looking for.  The TV is thinner than I expected (which is good...I thought for $599 I'd get an older, thicker version).  The standard picture setting is on 'Eco' mode so the picture looks a little dull until you adjust it (I put mine on 'sport' and the picture looks great).  Item shipped undamaged from Amazon so no issues there.  I was specifically trying to buy Samsung (which I own a 51\" plasma of theirs) and would've bought another one but this one was $50 cheaper and, according to my research, is also made in S. Korea like Samsung (granted, not made in the USA...but I'll take a S. Korean made product over one made in China any day).

But after playing around with the advanced settings for video and sound quality, I'm pretty impressed by the quality for the price. I think adjusting the setting is absolutely necessary to get the most out of this unit. The video quality is rich, crisp, with great contrast and detail. The colors look accurate. Not to mention the great frame rate - very smooth even during fast action scenes. The sound quality is adequate (again after a bit of tweaking), but you'll probably want an external sound system if you're serious about sound quality.The setup is a breeze (but I only mounted it to the stand, not on a wall. I would advise having an extra set of hands to help with unboxing and moving the TV). And I find the remote for this TV to be much superior to the one for the 60\" SmartTV.

I returned to Amazon a Panasonic VIERA TC-L55ET5 55-Inch 1080p 120Hz LED/LCD for being a \"dirty\" looking window into my favorite golf shows and having horrible sound and other issues. I went back to the store to look again, then ordered and then returned a Panasonic VIERA TC-P50ST50 50-Inch 1080p 600Hz plasma for having a really loud buzz on all bright scenes, horrible sound and other issues. I then went back to the store to look again, then ordered and then returned a LG 47LA7400 47-Inch Cinema Screen because even though the one in the store looked just great, mine had the \"dirty window\" effect almost as bad as the first Panny, truly bad viewing angle, and (even though they turned out to be wrong as I discovered), LG support told me I had to use the Magic Remote to change inputs, necessitating carrying two remotes, because the \"magic\" remote was severely limited in its ability to control my other devices. I finally decided that I wasn't going to get any luck buying TVs from amazon and headed out to get one from the local store.OK, this finally brings me to the LG PN6500 I brought home. This TV has none of the bells the others had, no 3d, no smart, but it DOES have a great picture, easy to adjust, and great sound. There is no sign of any unevenness to the pixels or the glass, whatever made those lcd's look like they needed cleaning. Compared to the LA7400, the PN6500 is not a pretty unit, it's shiny-black everywhere, and the picture cheats - it doesn't even go out to the \"thin-frame\" bezel, adding a good half-inch to the apparent bezel width during the time (always) that the TV is on. The LA7400 looked SO much better in my room. But the PN6500 has a far superior picture and seemingly just as great sound, to my ears. And that's what really counts, to me. I wanted the bells and whistles too, but the local store didn't have LG plasmas that had them, so I've ordered - HDMI switch, 5 in, 1 out, with remote control, Built-in Equalizer, Blue Jeans Cable brand - to expand my HDMI inputs (luckily, I have a good learning universal remote) and G-Box Midnight MX2 Android 4.2 Jelly Bean Dual Core XBMC Streaming Mini HTPC TV Box Player to get the smartness, hopefully even better. The 3d I'll have to give up, for now - I'll wait for that til they get affordable TVs with the clarity of picture and sound I need that have it.My bottom line on the 50PN6500:Pros:Picture bright and clean to the corners - even in golf, and sky scenes, with no color bleedSounds greatCons:Slight buzz on DirecTV screensaver scenes - only place noticed yet -reason for 4 starPicture cheats inside bezel -reason for 4 starOnly 2 HDMI inputs - fix with HDMI switch and universal remoteNo smart capabilities - fix with tiny G-Box HTPC that plugs into HDMINo 3d - live without for now, as 98% of use would be 2d anywayUpdate: My first PN6500 from the local store died dead after 3 days - it would only flash red, then green then blue, etc., screens - the local store replaced it immediately, the latest one seems fine so far.

No \"streaky action\".Very easy to set up (except, see below) just \"plug & play\". But yes, those who like to monkey with stuff to get things \"juuuust right\" will find all the tools to do so. (Take a gander at fellow reviewer D.Debar's excellent review for his suggestions on what to do here).Sound is better than average, listen before buying that soundbar.Now for the bad things (both minor): altho easy to set up, this thing weighs a ton (actually 0.029 of a ton, aka 58#, but let's not quibble). It's also rather unwieldy until set up. So, altho you will not need your \"tech guy\" to set this up, there will need to be two of you. And, if you want it wall-mounted, consider bring in that handy-man.Next- glare. This is the trade off you get vs a LED (also LED's use less power)- you need to have this in a place where you can control the glare during TV watching hours.So, you get better picture than a LED TV of the same price.  Easy to set up. Easy to use. Price is good.OH, and they have to deliver this by a local freight co. Once I figured this out, it worked fine.

So this review is a bit of a comparison.I immediately looked for the things that annoy me about the panasonic (image burn-in, buzzing, deep menus and response lag) and the LG was much much better.Pros:-Does not buzz (make noise). (well if I press my ear to it there is a slight buzz, in contrast, I can hear my panasonic buzz across the room though if its a bright screen).-The picture is excellent and I can turn off dynamic video settings. (this was impossible with panasonic and so it would change brightness depending of the content of the screen making it impossible to calibrate).-It gives me 2 \"expert\" presets that I can tweak, but the presets for cinema and game were excellent.-The quick menu is so nice. I can change screen presets or sounds without digging deep into menus.-The power LED, turn OFF when the TV is ON. This is so nice: no distractions when watching TV.-Sound: The speakers are not bad. What really shines is the option to make dialog clearer than the background noise. This is adjustable and works well. This is very handy if you don't want to turn the volume too high at night or something and still want to hear the dialog.Cons:-I have to aim the remote pretty accurately. I hate that so much. It's 2013, why to companies make remotes so cheap and frustrate people for years?...-While there is no burn-in issues, the manual doesn't talk about it except to mention to play a screen saver. There is no anti-image-retention screen (I haven't needed it so it may be a moot point).This is not a con but leaves a bitter taste of bad advertising/claims: The box says TruSlim Frame. Yes the frame is thin but there is a wider bezel still (the picture never reaches the frame, there is a hidden black bezel under the glass).Conclusion:With my limited exposure to plasma TVs, I will pick LG over any Panasonic every time. There has been no image retention (burn in), and it looks amazing.Note on buying from Amazon: Save ALL the packing material in case you have to return it. The carrier didn't check if the TV even turned on for me since it was colder than 50 degrees F outside. Amazon advertizes that they can dispose of the packaging for you (in which case you can't return the TV if it doesn't work, but carriers hate that I think so they will try not to take care of the packaging for you).", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice tv  if the stands  were worth a  crap", "Author": "Markus Wolfe \"markus\"", "ReviewID": "R1OSD97DLH3XGK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "nice  tv  except  my  tv  fell  off  my stand  when  no one  was  around,,further  lookin  that a  clip  had  broke on the  stand  so  i expect a  new  one", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Towani \"Chris\"", "ReviewID": "R18ERM862VRS4C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Honestly, I love this TV.

I don't hang out at sports bars or with friends who do nothing but sit and watch their big screens all day. I don't play games either, so this television is a whole new world to me, and I'm still trying to figure out what-all I can do with it - there are a whole lot of bells and whistles I may never use (advice appreciated - I'm a babe in the woods here).Set up was fairly easy, but since the television is so HUGE and heavy, it's definitely a two-person job, even though attaching the base to the monitor is a matter of a few screws here and there. At this time I don't have a bunch of equipment (i.e. DVD) to hook up to the television, but I did like the plus of a cord tie at the back to keep them all tidy. Once hooked up to the cable, there's some set up to go through with the remote (language, etc.). It looks like there's a bunch of options for adjusting the picture quality, but after choosing the home viewing option, I can't imagine wanting to adjust anything. The color and image quality are perfect, I had no idea Guy Fieri's Camaro was that red and shiny. Wowza, what a difference from the old set.Back to set up, with the cable I have, there's a digital converter box that's required, along with the cable company's remote for channel switching, so that gorgeous remote with way more buttons than I have any idea what they are for is probably going to gather dust somewhere. The most complicated part of getting up and running was figuring out the cable connections and how to get the channels from the converter box onto the TV (I really can't remember what finally worked), but after that I was up and running - but so far I've mainly watched the Food Channel and CNN. A bit miffed that now I really would love to watch some TNT and AMC and their idea of *classics* is Dirty Harry? I'll keep looking for real classic movies.The sound is very good as well, but until I get a set of cordless headphones, I haven't given it a full test (condo and elderly neighbors making blasting music a bad idea). If I can get my spare room wired for cable, I hope to move the TV in there and also try it out by hooking up the computer. If so, I'll pop back to edit this review with my thoughts.Even though this is probably more television than I'll ever need, it is a beauty and I already love it, and a HUGE thank you to the folks at LG and Amazon Vine for giving me a new life in the digital age.
