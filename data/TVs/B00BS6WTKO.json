{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best TV in its size for the price.", "Author": "Jimbo", "ReviewID": "R3LKOEJNUYJJGT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased this model from bestbuy for $399, believe it was on amazon for the same price.Pros:- Absurdly low price- Slim Bezel, generally attractive low key aesthetics- Loud (but standard quality) Speakers- No problems with build or design quality (no dead/stuck pixels, no light leaking, etc.)- Nice deep blacks, great image quality overall- 3 HDMICons (many of these are obvious artifacts of the low price):- Not real 120hz (like almost every TV that claims 120hz), but rather frame interpolation. It is 60hz. No noticable effect on high def files/streaming so far. Although I haven't watched sports on it.- No ethernet or wireless card- Sufficient but limited connections, noticeably missing was optical audio out- Colors cannot manually be adjusted (RGB), there are three color settings, \"Normal/Warm/Cool.\" For the price, I was surprised any of these settings were accurate. The default color setting (normal) was relatively accurate, but the warm setting was functionally perfect. Therefore I ultimately chose the warm setting for color accuracy and then modified the other image settings to turn the highly accurate warn setting into my personal preference of slightly cool coloring (similar to the default scheme you would see on many samsung LCD computer monitors). BOTTOM LINE - More control is always better, but you can get an image with this tv that is highly accuratem, although it takes a bit of doing (also sharpness is absurdly high by default on this thing).For $399 and free shipping, I basically consider this an absurd windfall that I was able to obtain simply due to the previously mediocre reviews of TCL (or its relative obscurity in general in the USA). This is a damn fine TV, and outstrips many many others I have seen in terms of image quality and color accuracy (despite not having manual RGB controls). If this thing goes on sale again, I would jump on it.And hell, its a two year warranty just in case. But you are getting almost 50 inches for $400-500. It's hard to complain.", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT quality after calibration", "Author": "Simon", "ReviewID": "R3L6WAI0A77EL3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV for $400 and out of box the colors were too saturated and picture was too bright. Couldn't change the tint settings and I was really getting annoyed with the reddish hues on faces and skin color. Everything just looked very off and unrealistic. Thankfully I found a solution.I got a tip from another owner to update the TV's firmware(it would allow changing of the tint). It's located on TCL's main website. One thing TCL forgets to mention is to rename the file to \"Merge.bin\" since it won't accept otherwise.[...]Firmware Update Instructions \u2010 3010 & 3310 modelsPlease follow these instructions to install the firmware update.1) Load the firmware update file \"MERGE.bin\" onto a USB flash disk.2) Take the USB flash disk and plug it into the USB port on the TV.3) Set TV to standby status, press \"Power\" key on the TV for 5 seconds, TV will autoupgrade.Note: Standby status is when the TV is off, but the indicator light on the front is lit, to indicate that it isplugged in.After the firmware is updated you can make sure(you don't have to if tint is already changeable) by going to menu - \"settings\" and look at software info under \"Build time\". Last time I updated the date was changed to Jun 5 2013.Then you can finally calibrate it to minimize the uneven tones!Brightness: 52Contrast: 53Saturation: 43Sharpness 4 (doesn't really make much a difference, so feel free to play around with)Tint: 46Color Mode: WarmBack Light: 40Dynamic Backlight: OffDynamic Light Sensor: OffNo Overscan (Obviously)These settings do dim the TV a bit but the results are worth it in my opinion. Color reproduction becomes much more accurate. Lastly, the TV cannot compare to more expensive models (usually 2x the price) but at only $400 it cannot be beat.", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love these TCL tv's.", "Author": "R.

I had this in a small office tho, so not the best place to test.I probably got a bad unit, but didn't feel like trying another round.If it wasn't for the bad display, the only complaint that I have is that when it was wall mounted, it was impossible to plug in component or antenna connections because of the placement, but HDMI was on the side.", "Date": "July 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "great picture quality and pretty good speakers", "Author": "emad", "ReviewID": "R2QSPYEPDRI3LR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, I wasn't sure whether to buy this or a smart tv.

The only other quirk about it is that it takes about 4 seconds to turn on. Not really a big deal but I am rather picky on televisions.

Its a great 2nd TV, very sharp 1080p. No blurring during fast movement. Looks great with a PS3. What else do you want in a TV?HUGE problem is their support and warranty or lack of both, 6 months later I received a recall/warranty warning via Amazon (way to go Amazon because TCL didn't tell me until I called and confirmed). Called TCL support Jan 21, said they would have a technician to fix it in 2 days. 2 days pass, nothing. Call them again, oh we have let them know it shouldn't be more than 5 days. 15 days later, nothing. Emails and calls to escalate result in nothing. Its now been 45 days and they still don't have a solution. I have asked for the repair manual so I can do the work myself but nothing... (The recall issue is related to 'we left a piece in on a certain number of serial numbers during manufacturing that could cause an electrical shock'. Oh great, electrical shock from my TV, just what I want. Of course shock can also mean fire risk which means I have had this thing unplugged since learning about it.)So I will say its a solid looking TV. But if you ever need TCL to support their own product, even if its their own problem that they admit to and suggest they will fix... Good luck.
