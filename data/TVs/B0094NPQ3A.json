I've owned lg tv's in the past and paid alot more and I love love love this tv better than any tv I have ever had.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best of Class", "Author": "Tom Fulery", "ReviewID": "R16IZBF04IJJDL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Several reasons to love this TV.First, great picture with lots of adjustments. Turning the backlight control down can make the screen last much longer.Second, decent sound with 20 watt speakers and a full graphic equalizer that really works.Third, it has an external AC adapter/power supply that you can easily replace for only about $20. (When a TV goes bad it's often the power supply, which can cost a lot to have replaced by a repairman.)Fourth, the remote is one of the best I've seen. Well-made, simple, easy to use & hard to lose.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tv", "Author": "carla gaikis", "ReviewID": "RN1R7PCCDZVTR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "No complaints at all.

The resolution is low with today's standards. It broke in 2 days. With better build quality and 1080p resolutionit could be an excellent TV. It is sad that no one makes 37\" televisions anymore.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Junk", "Author": "Michael E. Granahan", "ReviewID": "R2D353NZCJ808Z", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've bought two of these in the past five weeks. After the first two weeks, the first tv began losing sound and the picture dimmed and became muddy. Turning it off, waiting a minute and turning it on resolved the problem but it's neither convenient nor good for the unit. The frequency of the event increased so much I returned the set last week. I purchased another one today. After four hours of use, this one began doing the same thing so it goes back tomorrow. It's a great size and the picture is excellent when it works but there is apparently a design flaw with this unit. I should add I did NOT buy either set via Amazon so this is no reflection on the seller...but it is a very poor reflection on JVC.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$290.95", "Features": "Resolution: 720p\nRefresh Rate: 60Hz\nHDMI Inputs: 2\nDolby Digital 5.1 Decode\nSupport HDMI-CEC & HDMI-ARC", "Name": "JVC EM37T 37\" Class 720P 60Hz D-LED HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SV58gWucL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0094NPQ3A"}}
