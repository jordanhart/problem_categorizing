This won hands down.  Yellow Pixel or not!  Now that I have it at home, it makes my blu-ray's come to life and my Wii looks equally great.  I do not use the speakers, as I run the sound through my Home Theater. The addition of the glass pane over the screen is great for over-zealous gamers or those with little kids in the house.I would reccommend this unit to anyone.", "Date": "December 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV", "Author": "Krista D. White", "ReviewID": "R180NOPDKOC3RU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased the TV at a great discount from the normal price. Set it up and have been amazed at the quality. My wife occasionally complains that the picture looks \"weird\" because it is too crisp and the colors are too bold. It is like looking out the window, you actually feel like you are there. Sharp has made a fantastic product that actually backs up the hoopla of the commercials.", "Date": "September 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "great picture and color quality", "Author": "Rickie Aucoin", "ReviewID": "R2DYIOHQQBXWIY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this as a warranty replacement for a 3 year old 42\" DLP TV. I own 2 other LCD 32\" sets and 2 LCD computer monitors so this is not my first LCD screen, BUT it is by far the best I have ever veiwed. The local stores did not carry this set so I had to rely on pro reviews and customer reviews before ordering the set. People did not lie, it is a great TV. The black is as dark as I have ever seen and the white contrast is so bright I almost need sunglasses. The colors are vibrant and deep colors without being faded looking and washed out look that happens when many sets are set too bright. The edge light LED is fantastic and I never see any light bleeding from the sides no matter what the scene is.About the only negative I have is the menu. I have seen easier to operate and understand menus, but this is ok with enough time to get used to it. I am not that impressed with the built in apps, I can add movies to my instant queue on my Samsung blu-ray player for Netflix but for this TV I have to go to the computer to add them. The sound is typical TV sound, not that great but I like the fiber optic digital out and all my HD equipment runs through my Yamaha AV amp and then to the TV, so the built in sound does not matter to me.Given the opportunity to buy another TV, I would by this one.", "Date": "December 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Simply the best LED TV out there", "Author": "Karmjit Sandhu", "ReviewID": "RJH8SZC95K0V8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tv is simply great, I have 3 high end LED tvs at home (Samsung, Sony and Sharp), side by side you can tell this out performs in ways you can actually notice. It lives up to the hype in the commericals, just make sure you are using HD components with the TV. Next purchase will be the 60\" Sharp Quattron 3D TV, nothing else is worth my time. The price on Amazon is unreal, trust me I know, I get everything at cost at the big box retailers.", "Date": "November 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Quality and Performance", "Author": "Gregg Bolen", "ReviewID": "R1QY2YCEF1CYBO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After my two year old samsung LN40A630 front panel went out, I purchased this sharp tv. I researched many different makes and models before deciding to go with sharp. I have been very pleased so far. The picture quality blows away anything I've seen from samsung, sony, or any other major brand. The picture just pops with clarity and detail. I was pleased with the factory settings for the most part but you have many options to adjust the settings for your preference. I love the real glass front on this tv but it does reflect lamps, lights, etc... The sound is very good for a thin led but i hooked it up to a sharp sound bar that really helps the sound quality. I am very pleased with the service I received from amazon and sharp has a very good on-line support department. I would recommend this tv to anyone who wants a quality led at a reasonable price. I think samsung is very overrated and needs to take some lessons from the sharp team. Buy this tv now!!", "Date": "February 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Incredible LCD HDTV", "Author": "L. Sernyk", "ReviewID": "RWHHO61S3UTKR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't leave reviews for items unless they have a real impact on me and this TV sure has done so.  I bought it to replace an older 32\" LCD TV and have been absolutely amazed by the quality of the image (color, brightness, blur free motion) that this Quattron HDTV delivers.  The 40\" screen is much larger than my old 32\" but yet the TV overall is not much larger.  I had considered buying a larger screen size but I am glad that I did not as it would have been too big for the size of our room. I had needed a set box top receiver to pick up local HDTV broadcasts for my old 32\" LCD TV (no built in HDTV tuner) but this unit has it's own, very excellent built in tuner for over the air HDTV signals.  And it can also stream Netflix movies from the internet.  This is one awesome TV!I highly recommend the Sharp LC40LE820UN LCD HDTV.", "Date": "January 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "A middle-of-the-pack TV", "Author": "D. Dennis", "ReviewID": "R3LOLAO14ZI01L", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "On the plus side, the picture quality is remarkable, and the remote is more intuitively designed than most of the others I have.  On the down side, the ports on the back for connections (HDMI, optical, ethernet, co-axial, et al) are way too close to the edge, meaning the cables turning radius allows them to stick out past the edge, so you see all these loops of cable off the left edge.  If you try to bend the cables to avoid this, you risk either breaking the cable connector (as happened with an HDMI cable), or having the cable pop out of the TV's port.There is also a highly reflective bezel surrounding the screen, so you get to see a ribbon of reflection of the room.  That may not be a bother to some, but I find it distracting.The controls for aspect ratio don't always correct for proportional sizing...  the stretching and zooming functions are too limited, especially for PBS British shows like Antique Roadshow UK.This is my first flat-panel LCD, and I'd been unable to find this model at a local retailer, so when I bought it through Amazon, I was buying sight-unseen, with the advice of other reviews.  I have since seen other TVs that might resolve some of my issues with this set, but I won't know until this one gives out and needs to be replaced.The bottom line is:  This TV is okay, but I doubt it would be my choice if I were shopping today.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Should have bought a Sony", "Author": "F. Freymuller", "ReviewID": "R15RS1J3TH9FKW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The setup is painful. The manual is poorly written and incomplete. The setup menus are cryptic and not user friendly. And after all of that, the picture isn't all that great. Considering the raves about Aquos, frankly, I don't see it. Against my better judgement, I strayed from decades long satisfaction with Sony products and I got screwed by going with Sharp.", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not For Multiple Devices", "Author": "Katie Mac", "ReviewID": "R62K3IOYI7J0P", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We bought this Sharp Aquos model LE820UN and the picture is excellent.  None of these negatives apply to Amazon. However, we were told it was good in bright rooms (we have a big picture window) but it is VERY reflective, not a matte screen as we were told.  The menu is difficult as I see in other reviews.  The \"on\" light is white on a silver background; you can barely see it in daylight so you can't tell it's warming up or off.Now for the biggie that takes this TV from a 5 to a 2.  There are no three wire RCA input terminals, only the main five wire, which means no color image on 3 wire.  If you are looking for an easy setup for DVD and games, this is NOT your TV.  My WII and XBox360 won't connect without special attachments which I haven't found yet.  And I'm an electronics person.  The only input besides the 5 wire RCA and the cable are HDMI, USA, AV, and Analog, not standard connections for auxiliary equipment. For that reason, I would not purchase this model again.", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Full HD 1080p resolution\nNetflixTM Ready\nPC Streaming Capable\nUltraBrilliant LED System\nQuadPixel Technology 4-Color Filter adds yellow to the traditional RGB sub-pixel components", "Name": "Sharp 40-Inch 1080p 120Hz HD-LED TV with Netflix, Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FnQx%2Be5RL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003B5J8XG"}}
