I've owned it for about a month and it has everything I want. I'm able to hook it up to my gaming system and my computer so it works out nice. Picuture quality is excellent as well. If you plan on playing Call of Duty with more than 2 people you might want a larger screen.", "Date": "May 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Out of the Dark Ages, finally", "Author": "Mrs.58 \"GimmeDaOldDaze\"", "ReviewID": "R3721VH2R8BQ6M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Dear fellow AmazonianzMy previous television was a 25\" Sharp purchased 15 years ago. At the time it was considered top o'the line, even though it weighed a mere 3 tons and was unmoveable. When it fell, landlord came running up stairs to see if I was still alive. Being so large and dense, it survived the fall and continued providing great images but the sound was slowly fading. My cable provider who I wont insult here is so busy acquiring new customers with a new comprehensive total residential package, that smaller customers like myself in a small apt w one set have become like gnats in their ears. My reception was freezing or breaking up, request for service calls meant minimum 7 day wait, and a sudden event of no picture and no internet connection was becoming part of one's day, like the water or electricity going off each day in certain 3rd world countries.Fortunately I moved 2 days ago and so decided to leave the dinosaur behind w a neighbor who was thrilled as his dinosaur was even larger than mine and about to crash.I honestly had no idea (I originate from the dark days of silent cartoons) of what kind of television to buy for my new life. After researching the concept of saving money and ditching cable altogether by getting an antenna for a tv set up for local limited viewing still needed technological skill I'm too old and tired to get involved with.So I did what any idiot would do, I looked for the best reviewed set by Amazon customers, read all the reviews on a set I could afford and bought this one.Dont be put off by a 22\" screen, this smaller dynamo has a crispy clear picture; the images almost appear to be in 3D (is that what HD is?) the sound can be heard anywere in the room, I've postponed my hearing test (no joke) and the set can be lifted with 2 fingers, is less than 2\" thick and sits on a small table.In short, great set at an unbeatable price, easy set up although my cable man did it all and the remote is similar to my former cable company.Money well spent.", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Philips 22pfl3505d LCD TV", "Author": "Surfbro Phil", "ReviewID": "R1WJL0DAJNY13D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "What can I say, the TV was a good value for the size and it came to the house in good shape. We've had the TV on almost everyday and it's been working perfectly. The set up was effortless, it automatically scanned the channels and we were done. I had to go back and de-select some of the stations but that was easy too.", "Date": "April 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "some what annoyed", "Author": "lulu from gambak", "ReviewID": "R2W05N9SFPINZ6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "the set has a very high picture quality so long as i am in the sweet spot,aprx.5ft.of the tv.when ever i get closer or farther away the picture quality will either get very dark or very light.i have HDMI cable connected. the lack of consistent high picture quality  is my only beef.", "Date": "May 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worth the price", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R2QCOMAT4IA27V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A very awesome LCD.
