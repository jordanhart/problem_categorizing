You really do NOT need the directions, but they are excellentConnections amount,availability, setup:  10 ... I have cable, a PS3, and Xbox360, dvd ... too easy if you ask  me !Viewing: 9  ... great from even extreme angles. Adjustments in the menu DO fine tune your individual needs.  : the 1080P shines in action movies, sports, and especially video games ... resolution is phenomenal !  : I've experienced NO bleeding of colors or blurriness in high speed transitionsAudio: 7 ... OK at best, but I bought it for its viewing capabilities, NOT expecting a 'Bose' audio capacity.  One of its menu items allows you to keep advertising volumes the same as network broadcast volumes...  Mine does NOT function that way... commercials still too loud  I have it (easily connected to) enhanced by my stereo system, so this is a wash as far as I am concerned  when wanting to listen to a Nascar race, music concert, or other venue.Price: I did a LOT of homework, and found the price very acceptable in comparison to other tv's boasting  similar if not identical capabilities... I bought mine on sale at Best Buy, but lucked into a good priceGreen : Not much heat coming out of the uppermost exhaust ventsMy end result:  A great buy.  YES, a thumbs \"UP\" !  After owning a SONY HD tv, and experienced their lack of customer attention/satisfaction... a  lack of callback on their part force me to forever part with them as a trusted manufacturer.  In my opinion, their (SONY) trusted name is forever trashed/overpriced... if they will not  service what they sell... I want no part of them !", "Date": "August 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "I love this tv!", "Author": "polluxcastor", "ReviewID": "RFYUZI3FZEL96", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm watching baseball on the LN40B530 as I write this, and am blown away by the crisp picture and wonderful colors.  The sound is fine as far as my family is concerned.  I did make some adjustments to the equalizer, which improved how it sounded right out of the box.  I walked past the \"tv wall\" at a local Best Buy, and to me this TV looked as good as the ones in the $2,000-and-up range.  As far as its being \"only\" 60hz, it looked better than some of the 120hz ones.  Maybe if you're a heavy gamer that's an important consideration, but nobody here is.  Our previous TV was a Hitachi plasma EDTV that we thought was great, but this is a big improvement.  Can't wait to see a blue-ray disc on it.  I wonder if the previous reviewer had a defective one.

When I purchased this unit through Amazon I really didn't pay much attention to who the actual seller was since it received the standard free shipping.  I purchased this on a Saturday morning.  With in 2 hours I received a phone call from Crutchfield thanking me for my purchase and explaining how the unit would be shipped, etc.  I was very impressed with this and would absolutely purchase from Crutchfield in the future.As for the Samsung - The picture is great with HD.  I got it primarily for sports and the HD channels look great.  Some of the standard def channels are not so spectacular but I don't necessarily think that is a fault of the Samsung, I think it is more a Directv issue.

We love the sleek black design and easy to swivel stand.  Putting it together was a breeze and it was working within 10 minutes.We have a set in Samsung's Touch of Red line which has a constant blue light under the center of the tv that could be annoying - this set has the same blue light when it first turns on and off and that's it. Yeah.  This tv has a swivel stand with fluid movement and works great!  I can now watch tv from the kitchen with just a slight push to get the perfect angle for viewing.  The picture is super crisp and clear with the HD cable box provided at an extra cost by my cable provider and great viewing even without the HD cable service.We considered a Vizio based on great reviews, cheap prices and it being touted as the #1 seller of flat screens but found that the quality was not as good.  I also like the amount of control Samsung provides over the tv settings.  Another huge plus is the Samsung service, they stand behind their brand and their customer service is outstanding.  I love getting a live person to help with any issue or questions.  I dare you to find that with other brands.The only drawback (and lack of five stars) is the tv controller.  This tv controller does not work as well as I would like: it needs to be pointed directly at the bottom right of my tv (the infra red spot) in order for it to work properly and you need to really press down on the buttons for it to work.

I think this is why this model gets such great reviews - people tend to write them right after they get the product. However, our TV stopped working after less than five months. Upon researching the issue, it turns out that it is very common for this brand to have defective capacitors in their TVs. Some older models have been recalled in the past because of this defect. So common in fact, that the service agency we called did not even ask for specifics about what happened. Rather, they left a message on our phone stating \"we will call you as soon as we get the part\". Anyway, we are hoping to have it fixed under warranty but it sounds like many people have had to pay $500 or more to have this part replaced.

There was a dramatic difference betwen this and the other 1080 sets.  The Samsung was the best the colors were better than the others.  BTW if you are looking at the 37HLH30 go with the 37HLH40 the colors are much better with the H40. The other set I saw at the store was the Sony KDL40S5100.  All 3 of the final sets LG 37HLH40, Sony KDL40S5100 and Samsun LN40B530 had beautiful pictures but side to side Samsung has the best colors. Sony was second and LG third.  The LG had more connections (inputs) but my old set a Sharp Aquous 26 has so many that I never used them all anyway.The only thing that the Samsung did not have was the picture in picture.  But I barely have used this anyway on my Sharpe.After narrowing down my search to these 3 I was going to purchase the Samsung or Sony preferably or the LG if the price was a steal.  In the end I got the Samsung (on Amazon) at $60 less than I could have gotten the other two so I choose it.Overall the picture is unbelievable.

Honestly I don't know why someone need that many more HDMI ports but even if they did, they have HDMI hubs for that which make switching among devices even quicker.Sound is great for an LCD TV, good amount but I have mine hooked up to some 40 series  Polk bookshelf speakers and a Polk subwoofer. Talk about a theater experience in your own bedroom.Overall, if you can find this TV for ~600 shipped brand new, call it a steal! But like I mentioned above, for that price nowadays, you can find a 42 inch easily and possible a 46 inch even.", "Date": "November 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Plain awesome, excellent bang for your buck!!", "Author": "gp19", "ReviewID": "R3JWSFB746Z5DB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is just awesome and I love every aspect of it.First of all, the exterior design is dark, sleek and really attractive, it mainly continues with the line of Samsung designs we've grown to love.The TV isn't heavy at all so it's easy to move around and set up, be it the normal stand or the wall mount.The image will blow your mind. It's just as awesome as it comes. The 60,000:1 aspect ratio gives a pretty nice black-to-white transference and the brightness is really good too. The colors are really vivid and really make the images stand out.I have an xbox360 and a PS3 hooked up to it and the gaming experience is just mind blowing. The blu-rays on this thing are just breath-taking, the image is really sharp and clear and brightness and color depth will really amaze you.Many people have critisized the built-in speakers, but I think the sound is really good and clear. I also have it hooked to a 5.1 home theater system, but the built-in sound is not bad at all.The price is excellent IMO, I paid U$705.00 and it arrived in perfect conditions.Overall I think this item is a great buy. An excellent TV for a very good price.

The Samsung LN40B530 is a second TV that goes in our bedroom.  It was easy to hookup.  I only had a cable box and a DVD player to plug in, both are HDMI so it was a snap.I replaced the remote with a Sony Universal Remote which replaces the 3 remotes to run everything else.  I love the Sound Mode, SRS, Picture Size and Picture Mode buttons on the remote and programed them onto the Universal Remote.  P.MODE button changes the Picture Quality (PQ) in an instance, I love this feature as you can rotate through the different choices as quick as you can click your remote, the same is true of the other 3 buttons mentioned.The picture is fantastic.  My wife was amazed with the PQ.  I have viewed the Samsung LN40B530 against other TVs with faster refresh rates and higher priced at the different box stores.  Personally I feel the PQ is as good as other higher priced TVs with the faster refresh rates.  If you are price concise, this TV is to be considered.  One of the first things I noticed when I started watching this TV was the clarity and vibrant colors.  I remember in the first day or two of getting the TV, I was watching a show, I don't remember which one it was, but I remember thinking, look at the hair on the arms of that girl, that is how good the clarity is on this TV.  The PQ is awesome.  I love the rich vibrant colors.One negative item, when ever I see a label of HD on a program, I assume it is 1080 however the signal may only be 720 or less.  On my Sony all I have to do to check this out is hit my info button on the TV remote and it would display 1080 or 720 or whatever it may be, however with the Samsung it always shows 1080 even when watching non HD programs.  I have scanned the manual and haven't yet found where the correct info can be displayed.  Personally if the PQ is not 1080 I would rather watch something else that is 1080.If you can not differentiate the PQ of this TV from that of other TVs with faster refresh rates or if you watch little or no sports, don't be taken in with all the hype of the faster refresh rates and buy this TV and you will do yourself a favour and save yourself $100s of dollars.", "Date": "December 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Another great Samsung product", "Author": "Dean J.

I had a hard time convincing him that he needed more than a 32\" so getting him to agree to a 40\" was quite a challenge. He sits at least 12' from the tv and can afford ANY tv he wants. All that was left was to decide on which model would be right for him.After we decided on this model, the rest was up to Amazon and they didn't disappoint! Pilot freight delivered our LN52A650 set and they delivered this one to our Uncle. He lives about 50 miles from us so we wanted to be sure his delivery was truly \"white glove\". Some retailers say white glove when all they offer is to bring it inside and set it down in the room of your choice. Pilot unpacks it, plugs it in, puts batteries in the remote, powers it on and takes away the box.Our uncle had Charter arrive the same afternoon to hook up his new HD DVR. He is very impressed with the picture. But he is so completely non-tech oriented that we were amazed he even wanted an HDTV. Now if we can just talk him into actually USING the pause and record features of his dvr, he'll be all set! When he first got his cell phone, he would NOT turn it on. No one could call him on it. It took us months to convince him that he was NOT being charged airtime for just turning his cell phone on!

Everything about this set is fantastic, except for the lack of inputs. The sound was seriously lacking at first, but I just went to the Equalizer settings and moved the sliders from the middle over to the right a bit and now it's plenty loud.About the inputs: If you have a lot of older equipment, like this cheapskate, then you're going to run out. I have a 75 ohm digital TV antenna input, a composite, or AV,S-Video, or 75 ohm input from an FTA system, another composite (or AV) from the DVD, and the AV from the VCR. I also play tapes and slide shows from the DVR and digital cameras, which require AV or S-Video inputs.Well, this TV only has the HDMI inputs (3, I think), one set of composite, one set of AV, and that's it. There are no side or front inputs for a camera, and no S-Video jack. None of my boxes will let the digital TV  pass through and be picked up by the TV, so everything needs its own cable and jack. All those HDMI inputs don't do me any good, since only the DVD has a jack, and I'm not about to spend $20 for an HDMI cable just to use for a week or two. Of course I'll be spending probably $200 on cables when I finally get my big screen, so I'm being super cheap here.So I highly recommend this set for anyone that doesn't have a bunch of old stuff to connect. The picture is superb, the sound is great, the remote is easy to figure out, and the menu system is good enough. The instruction booklet is a joke, there are 2 pages of everything because of all the different models, but it does have a nice index if you need specific info.Oh, one more thing. Ordering from Amazon was great, and Pilot shipping rocks. Good communication, right on time, and the driver unpacked the TV so we could plug it in and verify it wasn't damaged or DOA.
