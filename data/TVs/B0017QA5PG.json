{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sony quality for generic price.", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"apartoflife\"", "ReviewID": "R2ERLNXHBE1C45", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first venture in the HDTV era. I patiently waited for years waiting for price drops. LCD HDTV's have finally become affordable and something rare... Sony has come out with an affortable decent size HDTV. This tv is sharp both aesthetically and the picture. I never saw this tv in person so I had no idea the bottom was clear plastic. It looks like solid silver in the pictures but it is clear in fact. It makes it look that much better. The sound is not great but HDTV's are meant to be paired with entertainment speakers. There are two HDMI slots and tons of component slots. The TV is solid in short. I paired the TV with a sony upconverter (Which I will review as well), and that did wonders to my DVD collection. The picture was not near HD quality but it was without a doubt better than ever before. It did improve the picture and the colors are vivid and bright. I have standard expanded cable service and plugged the cable in before turning on the tv for the first time. When I turned on the tv it automatically searched for chanels and to my astonishment, found 30 digital channels and all local chanels in HD! Straight out of the cable! No box necessary! This made me think cable companies are ripping people off renting out HD boxes. My cable company (Cox) has told me and advertised the HD channels can only be accessed through their special HD box. This is true if you want MTV and 12 other cable channels in HD but not local channels. Needless to say, It was a very pleasant surprise as I don't have to pay 17 bucks a month extra to see HD content.The second HDMI cable was used by my PS3. I don't need to say anything else but I'm in heaven. Here is the best part, this tv is one of the cheapest on the market and it's a Sony! Morevoer, the shipping was free and no taxes! I checked the best buy website and found I would be paying 70 bucks more at my local store! Highly recommended.", "Date": "June 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "The choice was easy for me...", "Author": "M. S. Kubota", "ReviewID": "R2FEWWT889ZVLK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR: Cheap-ish 32\" widescreen with a flat-black cabinet for my bedroom.  I already have a 32\" Viewsonic in the other room.  Although that was about $150 less, it shows.  I wanted something one notch up.  Plus, my experience with reliability and service was a nightmare with the Viewsonic.WHAT I GOT:  Let me start by saying I can't understand for the life of me why 90% of TVs today have glossy black cabinets.  Isn't the last thing you want near or on your TV something shiny or reflective?  Stupid fashion statement.  Maybe it's just me, but I'm more busy looking at what's inside of the rectangle- not outside of it.  So this pretty much narrowed it down to this TV alone.  Amazon had a killer deal on the Samsung LN32A450 when I bought the Sony, and wherever you look it says the Samsung has a better picture.  And when I saw the two at a store I would have to agree- just by a bit.  But that shiny glossy cabinet was the deal breaker for me.  Again- I just don't get it.  The Sony is all I want it to be- and a little bit more.  Very good picture, a cabinet that doesn't shout for attention, decent menus, logical input menu, etc.  The channel switching is a tad slower than past Sony's I've owned, but still not nearly as slow as various Philips, Magnavoxs, Viewsonics, etc. that I've used.  The unexpected bonus was after connecting it to my standard (not digital) Comcast cable, I noticed that I can pick up local HD channels.  This is something I was not able to do with my Viewsonic.  Perfect for the Olympics!!!  Not ready for a bigger cable bill, my intention for this TV was just to watch DVDs in WS and the rest in 4:3.  This was a nice surprise!The bottom line is I doubt you will find a better TV all-around for this kind of money.  Unless you're a hard core videophile who spends a lot of time with calibration discs and watching reference material looking for shadows and artifacts, you will not be disappointed with this set.  And if you are, go ahead and spend 50% more you lucky guy/gal!  And if you're considering lesser brand names to save $100 or so, I would say save up a bit and move one step up.  You'll probably own the TV for another 6-8 years so think how little that is per year.", "Date": "August 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great display and ATSC tuner; good sound", "Author": "Mitch Chapman", "ReviewID": "R29BK7K2DC3LY8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this item from another vendor.Picture quality is very good to my eyes.  The blacks are black, not washed out as on, say, a Westinghouse lvm37-w3.  Sound from the built-in speakers is good, but nothing to compare with external amplified speakers.  The built-in ATSC tuner does a great job.Setting up the channel list was easy and took only a couple of minutes, but  I do wish there were an obvious way to skip analog channels during setup.  I don't have cable and didn't want to include any analog channels in the channel list.  Since they were automatically identified, I had to manually hide them once channel setup was complete.Of course, it will be easy to skip analog over-the-air channels after February 2009 :)I wanted to set up a laptop with a TV tuner, for use as a DVR.  It was easy to connect to the Sony.  I'm using a MacBook, so for the video connection I used a Mini-DVI to DVI adapter connected to a DVI-D to HDMI cable.  For audio I used a 3.5mm male to 2 RCA-type male audio y-cable.  With the cables connected and the TV turned on, the MacBook recognized the display and automatically configured it to 1280x720 resolution, without so much as popping up a preference pane.The owner's manual warns not to connect a PC to the HDMI ports, and to use the RGB IN port instead; I'm not sure why, or whether this is specific to PCs with VGA video-out ports.  Given the MacBook's Mini-DVI video port, I guessed the warning didn't apply to it.Pros: * Very good picture quality * Good ATSC tuner * Plays well with computersCons: * No obvious way to skip analog over-the-air channels during channel setup", "Date": "July 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Comparing the M series to the L series", "Author": "Seen", "ReviewID": "R3HKDIB13EJPZ8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'll try to be succinct as possible, but I thought it might be helpful to compare the L and M series Sony Bravia televisions currently on the market, as they are similarly priced, and people may be wondering what differences are any may be worth the price or size difference/sacrifice.I recently \"tried\" both the M series 26\" Bravia and the L series 32\", and ultimately chose to keep the L series.  (Both were basically the same price.)To make a long story short, the M series is a step up.  There is a better control over picture display, display options, as well as a lot of convenient features like \"live color\" (I believe that's what it's called) which automatically adjusts colors to make flesh tones appear more accurate, and some kind of \"smart sound\" feature (which I'm not sure Sony's name for) which adjusts the level of the volume so commercials don't blast when you're watching a tv show--which is particularly helpful if you're an insomniac like me and other people are sleeping.  It also has an ambient light sensor for the backlight, which is truly missed now that I have the L series.  The sound is superior on the M series as well.  The menus and layout are just better, on the M series.  The L series it should be noted does not have a headphone jack--something most people don't use, but if you watch tv late at night or use speakers that utilize the RCA to miniplug (head phone jack) you are out of luck.  (Though there is audio input for external RCA connected speakers.)The L series seems to be calibrated differently visually and otherwise, but with some fiddling around I was able to get an accurate image (colors, sharpness, etc.)  (For instance, I generally prefer warm on color temperature settings, but on the L series, it's too warm, so I go with neutral and adjust the hue manually.I don't have the technical details for both tvs, but I do know they are both 720p and will output from inputs (like hdmi blu-ray players, etc.) in 1080i.  response time, contrast ration, etc. seem to be comparable, though I don't have the exact technical specifications.the other main difference is cosmetic, the M series is a piano black finish (popular nowadays) and the L series is a matte finish (which I personally prefer) and it should be noted that they space at the bottom as in the picture of the L series is indeed transluscent and that is also where you're indicator lights are.these are just a few of my observations from trying both models out.  ultimately, the M series is a step up and it's if it's similar in price, you may want to consider it.  But if you prefer the larger screen size at a cheaper price (though prices fluctuate) and the matte finish of the exterior of the tv, i would say go with the L series.I give the L series four stars, and the M series 5 stars, but they are both excellent choices.***Edit:  After spending more time with the L-series I am still very pleased, particularly getting great quality at a bargain price.  (If you compare other brands in this price range, this Sony blows them out of the water, though for a comparable price, I think the Samsung 32\" might surpass this one--though I generally prefer Sony.  Do keep in mind that the L-series is the bargain model, M-series is still bargain, but the picture quality IS better, and the XBR and S-series (not sure if S-series is still being made) is better than that.  For me, having the 32\" screen versus the 26\" was worth the sacrifice in image quality.  It's true what they say, I've found, (they being consumer buying guides), often when faced between two sizes, the larger one is the one most people wish they'd bought once they get home with it.  Both are excellent choices though.***", "Date": "December 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV, so-so delivery", "Author": "T. G. Reese \"bent_nail_software\"", "ReviewID": "R2X3CD3MNN0Q42", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I went to look at this TV (and others) at the local Circuit City, and couple of things struck me. First, these TVs will look much larger in your home than in the stores. You need a big room for a big TV, unless maybe you have a dedicated theater room with nothing but AV equipment and a couch. This is not that kind of TV ... but it is a huge step up from your typical CRT (old style) TV.Next, all these TVs look good, but the Sony's picture is wonderful - I received my TV just in time for baseball's All-Star game, and it was great. Setup is easy. The only downside might be that you will be disappointed in the appearance of any NTSC channels you still watch... partly due to the large screen and partly by comparison to HD channels.Seems like the \"white glove\" delivery service varies by locale. For me, the driver clearly wanted to do as little as possible and get out. Delivery, but nothing more ... plus they require the usual 4 hour delivery window.Amazon did have the cheapest price I found for this TV though, when you consider the sales tax. You can buy the TV locally for the same price, but you'll have to pay tax.All in all, I'm very satisfied.", "Date": "July 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Terrific High Def TV", "Author": "Golfnut \"Capecodder\"", "ReviewID": "R25HPM1N8ZQJ9M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this Sony model for my sun room as my third and final high def set. Not only am I very satisfied with the picture and quality that Sony builds into their tvs, the set arrived before the actual date of delivery and was very easy to set up with my Direct TV system. Sony has a reputation for building quality products and this tv model is no exception. Color and texture of picture is stunning, bright and vivid. My only issues and they are minor  relates to the fifteen second delay (blank screen) I get when I first turn on the set. The other issue (again a minor one) is the sound is average at best but acceptable.Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone who is considering 32\" HDTV for a reasonable price. 720 vs. 1080, I do not see any discernible difference in the picture comparisons between the two.Hence, my suggestion is to go with the 720 with the much lower pricetag.", "Date": "June 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nice value for a flat screen HDTV", "Author": "Eagle Vision", "ReviewID": "R3OSXAZVJKXGJI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was in the market for upgrading the last of the CRT televisions in the house.  For a viewing distance of about 12 feet, I needed something relatively big enough for that distance, that had HD capability, was inexpensive and reliable.Other flatscreen TVs around the house that I own include a Panasonic Viera 50\" Plasma 85 Series, Sony 37\" Plasma, Sony 32\" Bravia LCD.SETUP:The television is relatively light and I was able to connect the base to the television and lift it upon the stand without too much effort. 3 phillips screws were all that was necessary.After initializing the television for language, the autoprogram feature for channels worked relatively quickly picking up about 66 analog and 111 digital channels.USE:The remote is a no frills highly functional remote with standard buttons. The menu system is clear and intuitive.  The buttons of the remote are large and it is easy to read, for a farsighted person like myself.IMAGE QUALITY:Standard definition and high definition picture quality are excellent for the price.  You can choose Custom, Vivid or Standard settings (I chose Vivid).  720p resolution is great for a TV of this size.  1080p does not play a part in resolution until you get up to 46\".SOUND QUALITY:With the external speakers, I thought that the sound would have been above average.  However, I think this is where the price point reveals itself.  Sacrifice sound for everything, else.  This is definitely not a deal breaker, you can always opt for an external speaker system or run the TV with a receiver or speaker - if this is your primary TV.PRACTICAL ISSUES:2 HDMI inputs allow for a cable box and Blu-ray player.  Component input for HDTV is another option.VERDICT:Overall, this is a nice value for a television that will be primarily for the guests - or when I want to get away from the crowd in the house.  Just keep in mind, the sound is just average in quality.", "Date": "November 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Love at first sight", "Author": "Carl G.

The delivery by CEVA was prompt and on the due date. The Sony was taken out of the box and pluged in by the delivery man. Later I promgramed and did some set up. Using an old roof antenna I started to get up wards of 50 chanels most all chanels broadcast in one HD chanel so I get superb reception on those, The Sony upped my Converter box chanel count from 26 to 48 with the new Sony. The converter box I had gave a pretty poor picture with lots of fade out. This new Sony is like seeing TV for the first time, the picture is great!!  So far my only quibble is that the menu info is a little small so it's hard to do programing.  The LCD seems to work well and keep up with fast action, the picture is great, the sound quailty is good. As time goes along and I do some more set up it will only get better. If this TV lives up to the Sony quality reputation, I will enjoy this tv for a long , long time.  It's better to upgrade to an LCD than get the converter as the old tube TVs  don't seem to take the HD signals very well.  I love my Sony!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No balony!!!!

Sony has become one of those companies that will bounce your call all over the world. We called for a replacement set 3 days ago (which took forever I might add) and I called today to find out when our replacement would ship.  Let me also add that we were told our replacement set will not be new, it will be a refurbished set. When I placed the second call to find out when the refurbished replacement set would ship, I experienced multiple transfers and multiple holds - you probably know the game.

The second is: QUALITY. Value and quality are pillars of the Sony brand name. A brand name that usually commands a higher price...Until now...At $500, the Sony KDL-32L4000 is an absolute steal. First off...31.5\" of 720p real estate. With HDMI, you can accept a native 1080p signal. The signal is then downsized to 720p for Blu-Ray movies. A 32\" screen is small enough where you don't need 1080p resolution. I have my Bravia hooked up to a PS3 and Xbox 360 with HDMI. The results are stunning. I have the HDTV hooked up to my Surround Sound system via Optical Audio.I compared the L series and M series when shopping and learned the M-series does NOT have an optical audio out. It has a digital coaxial out plug.Seriously...the image quality on this HDTV is primeau! If you mess around with the settings and feed the TV an HD source, you get really good results. I also have a 40 inch Sony Bravia XBR4. Is the image quality as good? No. But is the image quality of that HDTV, $1250 better? Absolutely Not.I thought that the lack of a Bravia Engine chip would lead to unbalanced colors and distortion. No problems at all! IF you feed this baby an HD signal via its 2 HDMI ports, you're going to get a great picture.Design wise, it looks like the XBR6 with its floating glass panels. This TV looks real classy and sexy. It is solidly built and looks at whole lot more expensive than $500.This HDTV has a PC input. I have my laptop hooked up to the TV.

Your gain, I'm serious. Sony forgot.", "Author": "Nick", "ReviewID": "R2EQ91H2JRFFNK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, this TV DOES display 1080p images. It may be marketed as a 720p, but the manufacturer forgot to block the \"display\" setting from telling you what kind of image is showing, which ranges from NTSC to 1080p. Just press the \"display\" button in the remote. So having said that, THIS TV IS AMAZING FOR THE PRICE. Thanks Sony.I like this tv a lot. The picture quality is amazing when connected to my playstation 3. It still surprises me after a year of having it, since its almost like looking through a window into the games or movies.Games such as Bioshock, Dead Space, Dirt and movies such as Wall-e and the Watchmen look incredible. Regular NTSC channels look like crap, since the tv enhances the detail so much you have to make some adjustments to \"tone it down\".You go to the \"sharpness\" and \"noise\" settings and adjust them. They won't adjust themselves. I put the sharpness to the lowest and noise setting to its highest and NTSC channels look fine. It has 3 preset-adjustable picture settings: vivid, custom and standard.The speakers deliver crisp sound, but obviously they don't have a bass punch. You will need to connect a separate set of speakers for powerful bass, but the tv's are powerful enough for a room and they volume is loud at 30 where I usually have it. It goes up to a 100 but I've never used it once, don't need to.It has an optical-out connection that you can connect to a theater sound system for crisp digital signal.I don't know what the big deal with the black colors is, if they wash out or not. They're just black, and if you want blacker just adjust the brightness and the backlight settings. simple.I did notice that the backlight leaks a little at the higher right corner when the screen is black, but is not a huge problem. You can adjust it.I do have a problem with not being able to discard all the analog channels, and just keep the digital ones. You can't discard any channel for that matter, and they're all programmed together.The favorist list is pretty bad too. You can favorite 10 channels, but you can't organize them or delete the ones you already added. You just sort of push them off the bottom of the list with a new channel which is pretty time consuming and stupid.It has 2 HDMI inputs, and about 3 analog video inputs. 1 pc input which I haven't used.This TV doesn't have many features, aside from adjusting the colors. But again, its a Sony, and the picture quality is great. If people want many secondary features, they probable should pay double the price and get the more expensive Sony.I have yet to have a sony product break on me, and this tv will probably last several years, hopefuly.Edit : i saw my review right now and decided to update it.  It's august 2012 now and this tv is still working great.  I use it for several hours a day in the background even though most of the time I'm not even watching. lol.  There's a small back light leakage in the bottom of the screen.  It's not awful, just like a watermark of light about 2x3 inches.  But I'm assuming is a pretty general problem of lcds,  since most screens were made by samsung back then,  i heard.

When the couch is back against the wall it leaves us wishing we had one a little bit bigger as the writing in some of the on-sceen menu's for the TV service are a little harder to read.

There are fewer view options to choose from than on the Sharp.I called Tech support and was told everything would be better next year when the stations start broadcasting 100% in HD.  I watch TV more than I do DVD movies and if I had wanted a 19\" television I would have bought one.", "Date": "August 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "DONT BUY DONT BUY", "Author": "Donald Keylon \"Captain\"", "ReviewID": "R3E85TTAS14AIO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "What a total farce, Blu ray beats HD.... HDMI Cables?? Compatibility???$4500 dollars for NOTHING!! OK so I bought into the hype that Blu ray won the HD Race. I buy into the interoperability of SONY and THE hollywood ONLY serving HDMI Cable... I buy a new $3500 TV (Sony 1080P/24-52\") and a new Sony Blue Ray Player and a new BLUE RAY FILMED MOVIE for three TIMES the price of a standard DVD and put them together only to discover that I have black lines (letterbox) on my TV, The picture is a little worse than a standard DVD, the menu system works like a $27 VCR. The \"Interoperability\" between the Sony TV and the SONY BD works about like free air digital TV. And the Audio is like listening to a 3 transistor radio...What a total JOKE!! ANYONE CONSIDERING UPGRADING TO ALL THE \"NEWEST\" because of ALL THE HYPE, Leave your money in your pocket. Go buy a cheeseburger and put the remainder in a 401k. When what you have breaks, get new average price stuff. When you pay all the big bucks for all the best you get NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING!Maybe someone else's BD/TV actually works (oh wait a minute, ALL BD is Based on SONY technology....)Sony (who made my PSP, PS3, Nav System, TVx5, BD Player and PDA has seen the last of my credit card.MY NEW $500 BD Player hooked up to my new $3500 52\" LCD TV, wants to operate in PAN-N-Scan mode in order to utilize the other 30% of the $100 per square inch real estate I bought from sony.I though Pan-N-Scan died with Beta Max....In closing, you would get the exact same experience (Maybe better with a $27 480i DVD Player, a $99 \"Home theater system\" and a No Name Rear Projection 50\" DONT BUY DONT BUY DONT BUY", "Date": "December 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Never received", "Author": "G.
