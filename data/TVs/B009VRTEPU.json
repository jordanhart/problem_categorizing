Rao", "ReviewID": "R3E60CSKOKW86N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In the myriad list of televisions its always confusing as to what to buy as all of them although separated by a number in their models have a wealth of differences aka the 6003 and the ES6000. First there are three main features in the Samsung TV's one can classify a)The SMART (software piece) , b) The 3D piece and the c) Form factor and refresh rate. I know I wanted a TV which was not 3D , not SMART (too many bad reviews about this being unusable) but had the slim form factor (1.2-1.8) and a refresh rate of 120hz or higher. The ES6003 is the one which fits this review. The ES6000 is the \"fatter\" television with the same features as this one and the ES6100 is the SMART portion added each adds or subtracts 300 bucks from the TV price when compared at the same size. At 999 this was a good choice. Not a lot of adjustment for the picture settings , not too much of a bleed at the edges , lighter than the older TV's I have had and perfect for a normal living room. So far pretty happy with this TV. There is a feature matrix below each of the Samsung TV's on Amazon which is a good reference before one makes up their minds on which TV they want.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "A great package without the kiddie features.", "Author": "TheBronxBull", "ReviewID": "R4G41E3S3W1W5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the 6003 this past week from Amazon, and this was the only model that fit what I was looking for. My criteria was the following:1) No SmartTV Features: I already have an Apple TV, which is essentially the equivalent of the Samsung \"Smart\" features, but more refined, I feel. As such, and in addition to a slew of reviews I've read about the \"Smart\" technology being slow and antiquated, I felt as though choosing between a television that is cheaper by $100 and the \"Smart TV\" features, I would take the former. Also, being that an Apple TV is only $99, and is a much better package, this was an easy choice. Navigating through the Samsung menus is like flying a helicopter through a rainforest; they simply cannot beat the Apple software UI.2) No 3D Capability: Also, I have zero interest in 3D. I'm sure there are people out there that enjoy the features for their kids and all, but I feel as though it's a gimmick; both the 3D features in theaters, as well as the 3D TV's at home, I believe, will both be phased out and known as a \"fad.\" In fact, I actually *prefer* to see a movie in 2D at the theaters, since I think it takes away from the film a bit (the maybe one exception being Martin Scorsese's Hugo).3) Ultra-Slim and Bezel: One of the most important features I wanted was an extremely thin bezel, and the thinnest TV I could buy. When comparing the thickness of the regular Samsung TV's vs the slim versions, it's a huge difference (3.8\" in the thickest part vs 1.8\") - the latter being exceptional in the cosmetic department, which, in my opinion, future-proofs the purchase a bit more. On the edge of the televisions, it's seriously about 3/4\" thick, which simply looks beautiful. I love the Samsung televisions because of the great picture quality and features, but also because of their thin, light, and simple designs.4) Technical Specs: I wanted the 1080P resolution, the 120hz refresh rate, and the 46\" model.Negatives: the one negative thing I have to say about this television is that it only has two HDMI ports. That being said, I only use two, since my A/V receiver accepts everything else. If you bump up to the next model with the SmartTV features, you gain one additional HDMI port - not worth the money for another $100.Conclusion: after doing my research based on the above criteria, Samsung's 6003 model was the *only* one that fit the bill - no SmartTV (don't want to pay for features I'm not going to use), no 3D (waste of money, I believe), the Ultra-Slim form factor, and all of the technical features which make the display so great. At $697, I felt this was a great price - and I really liked saving money by not having the features I deemed obsolete.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV when applying some tweaks to picture settings", "Author": "CVD", "ReviewID": "R1DN82YB2RUFIC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this 55\" TV from Amazon on Black Friday for a great price... Pilot Freight delivered on schedule, and the delivery men were friendly  courteous.  This is actually the first tv I've purchased sight-unseen; I just couldn't pass up the price.  At first, I must admit I was a bit discouraged when I saw minimal \"flashlighting\" (aka edge bleeding), and quite a bit of clouding as well.  I have read numerous times that many edge-lit led tv's have these issues.  Also, when viewing the tv with the preset settings, I saw significant motion blur and artifacts (due to \"Auto Motion Plus\").  These were ALL easily correctable for me.  After tweaking my set, I am 100% happy with it.  I just wish I took \"before and after\" pictures to document the success I've had with the following tweaks.1.  Movie mode provides the most tweaking ability.  To correct the motion blur and aritfacts, these were the settings I followed via lcdtvbuyingguide.com (as reviewer Mark Douglas has also posted): There is NO motion blur or artifacts on my set after applying these settings.Picture Mode: MovieBacklight: 16 (I have mine set to 12)Contrast: 95Brightness: 45 (I have mine set to 32)Sharpness: 15Color: 50 (I have mine set to 60)Tint: G50/R50ADVANCE SETTINGSColor Space: AutoGamma: +1  (Mine is set to 0)Dynamic Contrast: OffBlack Tone: Off  (I have mine set to dark)Flesh Tone: 0Motion Lighting: OffWHITE BALANCER-Offset 25G-Offset 25B-Offset 28R-Gain 18G-Gain 23B-Gain 21PICTURE OPTIONSColor Tone Warm2Size: Screen FitDigital Noise Filter OffFilm Mode OffAuto Motion Plus OffLED Motion Plus Off2.  To help ease the edge bleeding, I loosened all of the screws along outer edge of the back of the tv, a quarter (1/4) turn for each screw.  This reduces the pressure on the leds and eliminated the \"flashlighting\" on my set immediately.3.  To help the clouding, I took my microfiber cloth and screen cleaner and gently massaged the screen all around - with LIGHT pressure of course.  It took no longer than 5 minutes.  I now have absolutely NO clouding.You can research the flashlighting and clouding fixes for yourself.  Others have had varying success, but it worked perfectly for my TV.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice display but some features are sacrificed.", "Author": "C. Rawlings", "ReviewID": "R2BOJZ80NTY6YI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received this TV yesterday and am mostly happy with it. The picture quality is equal to models like the ES6100, so for those that don't need or want 3D or the \"smart\" features it is a great option. For me though, there are two missing HDMI features I thought this TV had when I bought it. It doesn't support HDMI CEC or ARC (audio return channel). CEC allows your devices to control each other over HDMI (e.g. your bluray player can turn on your TV when you insert a disc to play a movie, software like Raspbmc/Xbmc can be controlled via your TV's remote, etc). ARC allows TV's to send audio from the TV back to the device that it is hooked up to (e.g. a Receiver), so you don't have to hook up two cables (i.e. one HDMI cable from receiver to tv for video, then one audio cable from TV back to receiver). These features will not matter for some people, but the lack of these two common features in modern TV's may sway me into returning the TV despite the great picture and great price. These are two features that should not be reserved for the higher end Samsungs. There are much lower priced Vizio TV's with these two features so it is somewhat annoying that Samsung felt the need to remove these features from this particular model.Pros:120hzSlim designGreat pictureNo noticeable input lag (for gaming)Good black levels (but not perfect)Not having to pay for features like 3D and Smart Apps yet still getting a great screen.Cons:Very minor light bleeding on the edge of the display (runs vertically along the entire length of left and right sides). I'm nit picking here.No HDMI CECNo HDMI ARCSome of the connections come straight out the back of the TV (coax, power, etc). At least the HDMI ports come out the side of the TV.Limited HDMI/Video connections (not a problem for those that own receivers though).", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Extremely Pleased", "Author": "A. Sharp", "ReviewID": "RE8FTH1A2427S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was on the market for a 46\" HDTV for a while; we have a small living room and 46\" is the perfect size for it.  I was mostly looking for 1080p + 120Hz.  I also wanted to make sure the manufacturer had a solid reputation for quality.  After doing a little research, I also learned that I wanted to make sure the TV looked good from many different viewing angles, and I also wanted to ensure that the built-in TV speakers offered decent sound quality.This TV showed up on my radar thanks to the Black Friday sale, for $698.  I looked it over and confirmed that it had absolutely everything I wanted.  Even better, it DIDN'T have all of the extra \"junk\" that I didn't want.  (smart TV, 3D, etc etc)  Generally speaking I am a late adopter to new technology, as I prefer to let technology mature a bit before I think about jumping on board.  I also like prefer my devices to do one thing and one thing VERY WELL, rather than having something do many many things but none of them particularly well.This TV showed up at my door very quickly (1 day after Amazon shipped it from PA), and I was thrilled to hook it up and try it out.  It turned out to be even better than I had hoped.  This TV is pure quality, inside and out.I also followed the advice of a fellow reviewer here (Mark) and tweaked the settings using the 6100 settings guide as a template, you can see that here:[...]The factory defaults for this TV aren't too shabby at all.  But making some of these adjustments really did improve it. The picture quality is absolutely stunning now.I also observed (as another reviewer here has mentioned) that some of the screws are indeed rather tight to get threaded in, while trying to secure the stand/base to the TV.  I think this is actually by design, these are very tight threads and once seated, it holds strong.  I didn't have to go so far as to use a power drill like the other person did, just a little extra elbow grease and those screws will get in there no problem.  Don't treat it like a fragile delicate flower; just grit your teeth and put those screws in there.  Once done, the stand is very solid and secure.I love this TV because I feel like Samsung was thinking of people just like me.  People who want high quality at a reasonable price, and don't want all of the extra gadgets/bells/whistles, and fluff.  This TV does its job very well -- you will not be disappointed.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice TV on the 3rd Try", "Author": "J. Leavitt", "ReviewID": "R5EJEA7F0VJVU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got a good one after three tries.Like many others, I bought the 46\" during Black Friday.  And as others have stated, it fills a very nice niche.  Not Smart (I have other devices for that), no 3D (no interest whatsoever), with a beautiful display.  And as others have stated, one negative I have is that it only has 2 HDMI inputs.  I currently have my X-Box, Blu-Ray, and PC all competing for an input.  In the future I plan to get a receiver and will hopefully negate that issue.I bought my first TV from Amazon. I received it promptly, as always, and the box was in good condition.  The screen showed significant clouding on a black screen (lighter smudges of white) that was noticeable during movies and especially while viewing black-background presentations on my computer.  Dissatisfied, I contacted Amazon and they accepted the return.  I did have some difficulty coordinating the UPS pickup.  I work 24 and 48-hour shifts, sometimes back to back, so my preference would be to print a label and drop it off at UPS, or at least be able to schedule a specific date or time (I don't like wasting their time if I' m not home).  Amazon and UPS were both unable to help in that regard, but I eventually got it picked up when I happened to be home a week after my initial RMA request.Amazon offered a full refund (instead of replacement), as the TV was now out of stock.  I went to my local Sears who was one of the only stores to have the TV in stock at $700.  I bought the TV, brought it home, and turned it on.  The screen was damaged on the left side with vertical lines.  I returned to Sears and exchanged it for another.This final TV has minor clouding, most of which is negligible after adjusting the picture settings.  Overall, despite the inconveniences, I am happy with the TV.  The picture is absolutely beautiful.  Also, the TV itself is physically attractive.  It has all the features that I wanted, and nothing I didn't.  HOWEVER, seeing some of the other reviews, and with my own experience, I'd have a very hard time recommending it to a friend.  It's a fine TV, but perhaps the QA process at Samsung is a little lacking.  Also, it might be worth noting that this TV was just released, and that future models may be of better quality.I give it three stars for the process.  I'd give my final TV 4 stars for being nearly, but not quite, perfect.", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "JasonT", "ReviewID": "RFV8343ALCG55", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I took a risk an purchased a TV online. In this case it payed off. The TV is awesome. The colors are amazing and it is bright. It has great quality without having that \"soap opera\" effect. The 3 best points for me are:1) Slim. The TV is extremely thin. I don't have any space issues but being so thin really adds to the beauty of the TV. 2) Small bezel. One of the things I hate the most about TV/ Monitors/ Tablets/ etc. are the big bezels that surround the screen. This TV has an extremely small bezel. It really makes the TV seem so much bigger.3)) Sound. I am actually really impressed with the sound. Most TVs like this have horrible sound. This TV has excellent sound that has great range and is loud. It doesn't come close to an actual sound system but for built in speakers it is very impressive.My only regret is not getting a bigger one. Not that this size is bad. I love it.

Remington", "ReviewID": "R2ZKQLFLSRLAYU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So you're looking to buy a new television?  Congratulations... It's an exciting prospect and there are a lot of televisions out there.  Each has its own set of features and the picture quality varies from manufacturer to manufacturer.  My wife and I just went through a holiday exploratory to locate a television that was right for us.  We chose the Samsung UN60ES6003 mostly because of the picture quality we enjoy from a 46\" Samsung we purchased last year and also side-by-side comparisons with other televisions at our local AV store.In this review, I'll outline the Samsung 60\" LED television and discuss how it integrated into our home use.  Perhaps this might help you make a decision which television is right for you.The Samsung UN60ES6003 is a stripped-down version of their LED television line.  It has a generous 60\" screen without the big budget price.  It features all the respectable specifications, including 1080p and 120Hz operation.  It offers a 240Hz clear motion rate, which smooths out action sequences to prevent ghosting and pixelization.  It is not a 3D television and has no Smart TV functionality.  The 6003 is an upgrade to the old 6000 series and features a new slimline form factor, giving it a sleek, thin case.  It sits tight to the wall, for wall mount installations.  The television comes with a stand for those who don't intend it to be wall mounted.AV connections are also stripped down.  The television comes with the following connections:  (1) Component In  (1) Digital Audio Video Out  (2) HDMI  (1) Shared Composite In  (1) USBYou should be aware that this television does not support an HDMI audio return channel.  If you need to route the audio from your television to your AV receiver through the HDMI port, you won't be able to do it.  This shouldn't be confused with not being able to use an AV receiver with it.  The sales associate at our local AV store recommended we not buy this television because we wouldn't be able to use it in a home theater setup.  I knew this was incorrect.  It integrates very well into our home theater configuration and is perfect for people who only want a television with no bells and whistles.  If you have an AV receiver, you connect the TV to the HDMI Out connection on your AV receiver, then route all your other components (cable/satellite receiver, DVD, etc.) to the other inputs on your receiver.  Audio and video signals transfer fine to the Samsung television.The other feature this television doesn't support is HDMI control, known as CEC (Consumer Electronics Control).  This feature provides single-button control of up to ten HDMI devices, such as a home theater receiver, a Blue-ray player, etc.  We don't really care about this, so the absence of this feature is no loss to us.  If you don't mind manually powering up your other devices, then don't worry about the loss of this feature.The remote is a standard Samsung remote that has no universal features.  It's very basic and very plain, but it does what it's intended to do and that's control the various television functions.Samsung has a reputation for quality imaging with its televisions, and the UN60ES6003 is no exception.  The 46\" 6000-series Samsung we purchased a year ago has an excellent picture, but that particular model is known for having flashlighting problems.  Flashlighting effect is an illumination of light on the screen, usually in the left or right corners.  It gets its name because it looks like a small flashlight is shining down on the corners.  We notice it on the 46\" during dark scenes or on a blank image.  The 60\" UN60ES6003 doesn't show any of these effects.  Dark images are uniform and the contrast is deep, providing decent image contrast.  Overall, the video quality on the 60\" UN60ES6003 is excellent, although the brightness is not as controlled as on our 46\" 6000-series Samsung.  Regardless, for the money, the UN60ES6003 provides an excellent image.If you're not brand loyal to Samsung, compare this model with comparable models.  Take into consideration the off-axis image quality.  Sharp televisions tend to have outstanding off-axis performance.  Comparing this Samsung to other televisions, we found it performed better off axis than other brands in its price class.  It's hard to beat the performance for the dollar paid with this model.The Samsung UN60ES6003 is a good way to break into a 60\" display at a budget price.  It has the most basic features to accommodate most home theater setups.  For those brand-loyal consumers, Samsung offers a nice quality image without any of the extra features that more expensive models offer.  If all your after is the television's basic features, then the UN60ES6003 is definitely worthy of your consideration.", "Date": "February 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "This TV made me cool.", "Author": "Shawn M.

Dave R. was kind enough to comment and informed me this common LCD/LED issue is referred to as the \"Soap Opera Effect\" (SOE). The issue is, even though I couldnt explain it right initially, all parts of a particular picture frame (background, foreground, everything) is brought into focus. That Depth Field that directors look for (focusing on what's important, blurring out the rest) is intentional and LED/LCD TVs of today will remove this Depth Field through the \"upconverting\" processes. I googled this issue and there are people that love the effect and people who hate it. I didnt like it too much myself, and was able to disable this by changing the AUTO MOTION PLUS function to CLEAR. Some sites say to turn it OFF, but that will make your live games and such \"jitter\" too much. Changing it to CLEAR resolves the SOE while leaving the motion smoothing function engaged. I already rated this TV 5 stars to begin with. Now that this Soap Opera Effect is gone, I would throw another couple of stars in there if possible. Thanks again Dave!!!ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWS:Looked at 3D TVs in the stores and found them less than impressive. The 3D tech is still pretty weak and, last I checked, ESPN is still the only 3D channel out there. They really need to step up the game on this technology before I join in on it.This TV is incredible, from picture to it's incredible profile (super-thin). I must have missed the last wave of thin line TVs because I was not expecting it to be 1\" thick (roughly). You see TVs like that but there's always a 2 or 3 inch bulge on the back somewhere where they stuff all the hardware. This puppy is the same thickness throughout. I cannot fathom how they stuffed all that tech into that thin shell. My 42\" flat screen is practically obese compared to this TV.The LED is super clear, with little to no glare from the lights in the room. It is truly amazing.It's almost too clear. Seems that, in giving you the best picture possible, it looks like it removes some of the production out of the footage. Hard to explain, but imagine a scene where three or four people are in a bar. With this TV, this same scene looks like three or four regular people sitting on a stage-set. Almost like you are seeing it with your own eyes instead of in a camera. Makes some movies look like acting practice, while also making NFL games incredibly sharp and true to life. Hope that makes sense. It is, in a way, too damned good.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Overall an excellent LED HDTV - but horrible remote control lag", "Author": "Gearhead Mania", "ReviewID": "R36F7TRJFNOXV5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Samsung UN60ES6003 60-Inch 1080p 120Hz Slim LED HDTV (Black)The ES6003 in 60-inch replaced an older Samsung 40\" LCD HDTV that I bought over 5 years ago. The 60-in ES6003 is significantly larger, but also significantly thinner. It is about as thick as my Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone with the Otterbox Defender case! This is very extraordinary, but it also made it hard to handle the large TV while trying to install the stand. I needed a large enough table to hold the screen and it was almost impossible to find. I'd recommend just going with a wall-mount straight out of the box.During the initial startup, I noticed the TV/HDMI/Composite inputs would result in odd motion. DVD movies and HDMI output from my PC would look almost like real life, with extremely fast frame rate (think 48 fps vs 24 fps) and then suddenly slow down. There was also some ghosting with fast moving images. I played with the menu settings and found out that the special power saving settings, motion settings, digital filter, etc... would cause that behavior. Disabling everything and going to game mode made things look \"normal\", and one could still utilize a power savings mode to reduce the LED output. The EcoMode does weird things when a mostly black image comes on (like credits) by dimming automatically.I noticed that the  \"ScreenFit\" option is only available with a HD signal, so when I connected my PC's HD video card output to the ES6003 via HDMI, it overscanned but the ScreenFit resolved that issue. With my Standard Definition cable tv signal, I am stuck watching in 4:3 mode or squished 16:9 mode. Long story about why I don't have HD cable TV, but bottom line is that Comcast wants a large sum of money each month just so I can watch HD TV. Amazon Prime / Instant Video, Hulu, and Netflix does a much better job at a lower price.The screen coating causes it to glare a little more than a matte surface, but it isn't a big deal unless you have a bright light source facing the screen. I connected my Xbox 360 to the ES6003 and did not see any ghosting issues. In fact, the screen refresh rate is fast enough for gaming that I don't really see a difference compared to my Asus 24.6\" gaming LCD. The screen can be a little darker than I'd like, but the image quality is acceptable for gaming.The LED backlighting will far outlast traditional backlight technology. I have a Dell Studio 15 laptop from 2008 which had one of the first displays with LED backlighting, and it is still going strong 4 years later. All of my other CCFL backlit LCD displays show significant reduction in brightness after 3-5 years to the point I am running them in maximum brightness.The revision code for this ES6003 was \"H\" and I am told that this indicates a Samsung display. It was manufactured in October 2012, and appears to be a newer design while the other Samsungs were released earlier in February 2012. There is no Smart functionality, so it is just a HDTV which is fine by me. I run my own HTPC (home theater PC) which has a dual-core Intel Core i3 running Windows 7 and a discrete HD video card. It's silent and has so much more versatility than a built-in Smart TV, although at a slightly reduced convenience. To rectify that, I just use a wireless Logitech trackball and wireless keyboard.The remote control lag is horrendous. The Samsung remote doesn't register volume up/down changes immediately, and if I rapidly push the volume up or down, it will all of a sudden change the volume dramatically. That is about the only negative aspect of this TV. My Xfinity remote does not cause this issue, and neither does the Samsung remote for my other LCD TV (which happens to work fine with this new TV).Overall: 5/5 stars. The stand installation can be a hassle due to the large size of the TV, so I recommend considering a wall mount even before you open the box. I really like this Samsung TV and am not disappointed. The first flatscreen LCD TV I bought was the 40\" Samsung 720p from over 5 years ago and it is still running perfectly in the guest bedroom.", "Date": "December 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good for a non smart TV.", "Author": "Colten Berges", "ReviewID": "R1055HN2LZJ3LB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this 46 inch TV for $697 on amazon.com. I received the TV with in 4 days even though it said it would be a week for shipping. I've now had this TV for over a month now and it has lived up to all my expectations. The picture is 10x better then the previous TV i owned. (Which is not hard to do because that thing was bare minimum and 4 years old) They TV has decent settings out of the box but will def need some tweaking to user preference. As stated in the product description it is 120 HZ NON SMART LED TV and apparently has the ability for an Motion Plus 240 HZ feature, but I have yet to figure out how to do that. (If I read the manual that might explain it) Regardless to that the 120 HZ does a superb job on picture display. There is and auto motion 120 HZ feature which can clear or smooth images at face paces, the clear feature seem to be the best bet from testing on different sources (blu-ray, video games[ps3]). The TV has a built in media player which allows you to watch movies, listen to music or view pictures from a usb flash drive or and external HDD that has its own power source. The feature is simple to use and does a wonderful job displaying the images. I have been recently watching the show Arrow in 720P from my flash drive. The sound quality like most TV's is not surround sound but does a good job, once you set the settings or select a pre made Equalizer setting. The TV its self is beautiful looking and is a little heavy if you try to attach the stand to it buy yourself with out trying to damage the screen or any other part of it. The stand is a swivel and can turn a good good distance to either side for viewing. The TV has a limited input selections so if your wanting a TV for everything this one will not work. The TV has 2 HDMI, 1 Component Cable Input, 1 TV Cable receiver, 1 Digital Optical Socket and 1 RCA input. Unless your computer has and HDMI plug then you will be fine. I mainly use the TV for ps3 gaming and watching blu-rays and videos through the media player. I've the tried the cable TV on it and it looks nice but don't watch much TV.I hope this review to helpful some and if you decide to buy the TV I hope you enjoy it as much as I am.So I'll do a list of pros and cons to conclude this review.Pros-Great 120 HZ picture QualityThin LED TVElegant looking bezel around the screen to make it look as big as possibleBuilt in media player (that plays most video formats)Many picture options for setupEasy to use (no smart features)Digital Optical socket for watching TV and the media player with surround sound.Eco Power SavingsCons-Decent sound qualityLimited Selection on Cable Inputs", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not Bad", "Author": "G2C", "ReviewID": "R1M9ZFM7N1PJRQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was able to purchase this TV for just under $700 as part of a black Friday deal (2012) I'm pretty happy with the purchase but this TV won't win any awards.

Like many others, I have literally spend days, nights and weekends studying up for all the sales and originally I had my mind set on the 6100 but after much deliberation, I have realized this TV is best in its natural state.The SmartTV isn't that smart. As great Samsung sets are, it just doesn't have the guts to really give you the Smart functionality like other devices out now. Plus you could get one of those for cheaper than $100 which is what the difference is and it would work MUCH better and fast.The 3D is a gimmick and I had no desire for that. And like everyone else the BIGGEST negative about this set is the 2 HDMI outlets. However; for just $10 you can buy a HDMI splitter (sold on Amazon) and the problem is solved. It's still nice to have more than 2 outlets in 2012-13 but everything else on this TV is just fantastic.If you paid $700 for this, be grateful and enjoy.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV, A little light bleed 4/5 stars", "Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "R27GH7JE8PKOD6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have had good luck with Samsung TV's and think they offer the best picture for the $$$. With that said, I had been looking around the last few months for a TV that was slim but didn't have 3D or smart features. The Samsung's that have smart features and 3D are $300 more then this TV, which i do not think is worth it. Thanks to Amazon this TV arrived a day after I ordered it. It was very easy to setup and mount onto the wall. I had my mind set on getting a sound bar, but have been pleasantly surprised with the sound quality of the speakers. The only downside is the TV has a little light bleed on the sides and on the bottom of the set. For some reason the light bleed at the bottom only happens after the TV has been on for 30min, but is only noticeable when there are black scenes. Not a big enough deal to return the set, as I have been told that all LED TV's have some light bleed. I will however try the picture settings that some of the other reviewers have recommended. I am giving this TV 4 stars because of the light bleed at the bottom of the set. Other then that its a great TV with a very clear picture.Updated 1/3/13 - This tv is sadly going back to Amazon. There is major flashlighting or light bleed in the center of the screen. I tried to live with it, but its really distracting during dark scenes.

Hits SWEET SPOT for the price and features.  Amazing bargain!!", "Author": "Kwest", "ReviewID": "R1ULCR7XB9N8QD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After doing much research on which LCD to buy and what features I was looking for, I found that Samsung's ES6003 on Amazon fell right into a sweet spot category.  It is the sister model of the ES6100, but like many other reviewers have noted, if you're looking to pay for a high-quality LCD big screen TV without all the extraneous features like the SMART TV and 3D while having the ultra slim design, all at a great price, this TV is for you!It arrived just the other day and right out of the box, the small bezel and slim design make it extremely appealing.  Unlike some other Samsung models, the ES6003 comes with a swivel stand.  The configuration features on the TV itself are very user friendly and after hooking it up through HDMI, the PQ is really extraordinary. Very crisp and clean. Sure, it's no plasma, but it certainly punches above its weight and holds its own.No problems so far with the usual suspects correlated with edge-lit designs like bleeding or flashlighting.  And though the sound isn't exactly home theater system quality (as you would expect anyway), it is perfectly adequate, despite what others have said.Luckily, The Dark Knight was on TNT and allowed for checking out the different contrasts available for blacks.  Seemed like \"Movie\" settings do look best in both movie and general TV viewing paired with turning off the Auto Motion to prevent the \"Soap Opera\" effect.  It's easy to monkey around with the settings to find something that you like.DRAWBACKS: One of two reasons I would give this four stars instead of five is that the TV that was sent to me had screws that didn't fit well AT ALL with the guidestand and stand during assembly.  After struggling mightily to attach the parts with a regular screwdriver, calling Amazon and Samsung, looking things up online, I opted for the power drill, which probably increases the likelihood that a part may crack if forced in.  Fortunately, it didn't, but if this problem is widespread, hopefully Samsung can fix this issue.  The screws should fit with a plain old Phillips.The other is the dearth of HDMI ports.  Three ports would have been just right and almost all the other LCDs I've looked at had at least 3.  But those who are buying know this going in, and for the Black Friday price of$697.99, you can't really complain as the ES6003 is definitely a great deal.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "stuunning and a smarter buy than the smart tvs", "Author": "Philip Johnson", "ReviewID": "RF03R3YHUCMMF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent the entire day researching and black Friday shopping.Knowing how superior Samsung picture quality is and design I decided to stick with them. At first I was considering the models with the real 240 Hz refresh rates and built in smart features.  But these were all around $2000 and higher.Then I narrowed it down to the un55es6300. I saw the sister model at best buy and almost decided to pull out my credit card and buy it online .... for 1100 quite the deal. I believe this deal has run out of stock on amazon now by the way.  However after reading lots of reviews I decided that the Samsung smart features were not really what I was looking for because they are slow and dated and desperately need a faster engine for it.  Also, I hook my computer directly up to my TV to watch Netflix and play spotify all day, so why purchase anything I do not need.So, I then decided to get the un55eh6000. However, after seeing the sister model at best buy I realized one thing .... it is chubby and dated, I believe it may be last years model. Also, it only has two HDMI in pus, that's it. At best buy and online earlier it was 799, not bad but for an older model ? Also to update, that one is now 999.So, I decided, this is the one. Its thin, beautiful, has everything i need, and doesn't have the smart features I  don't need. Cannot wait to get it in the mail. Based upon the twin sister model of this TV selling at best buy for 1100 I have very high expectations and do not expect to get let down. Oh by the way this does also have the swiveling stand and 1.8 depth and 240 auto motion which amazon specs don't really mention. I found out on cnet this is a BRAND new model :-)  happy shopping !!update: this tv is now $1200 but can still be found for $999 with free shipping from other websites.  this tv for $999 is by far and away the best value per dollar for any TV on the internet, which is why i bought it.  $1200 is still a great deal however.  also the sister model of the model selling with the smart features is now $1300, still a great buyrespond to crtiticisms:  this is a \"real review\"... i shop on amazon all the time.  also, i have in fact \"seen\" the exact product.  best buy and fry's electronics all have the series with the same exact build quality, specs, and features.  this model i am reviewing is the exact same as the un55es6300, just without the smart features, which in my opinion is a bad thing from samsung at this point, every review about smart samsungs are bad when they refer to the smart abilities.", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Serious clouding/backlight bleeding issue", "Author": "bruinphd", "ReviewID": "R1J72D15J5O4QN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I should start by mentioning that this is my first LED experience. I didn't do a lot of research before buying this product because it was really cheap compared to what it is offering (paid 690). It is a great looking TV. Colors look bright and vivid. Everything was perfect until I started using it more than 2-3 hours at a time. So after watching 3 hours of TV i decided to watch a movie from my computer. So I plugged it in and turned the lights of and started watching. As soon as the movie started I noticed that blacks at the edges are lighter than the other ones. It was really distracting so I turned it off and did a backlight bleeding test using a video from youtube. It was clear that my TV has serious clouding issues all over the edges. I was able to reduce it by turning down the backlight and using a small desk lamp to brighten the room a little bit. However, it was still there. So I decided to return it back. Since it was a black friday deal they don't actually change TV. So I am waiting for refund.I should mention that if you are planning to use this TV mainly in a bright environment, it is perfect for that job.

However, I was disappointed with the soap opera effect when I played a DVD movie or watched a movie on the TCM channel with Film Mode set to Auto.  I changed to Game Mode setting when watching movies. Doing so better helped reduce the soap opera effect. The contrast was a bit too high at this setting, so I lowered it from the default of 95 to 70. That worked. Movies don't look as fake anymore in the Game Mode setting, at least for me.I'm wondering about this TV's capability (or any on the market) to satisfactory auto detect 24 frame per second movies (Film mode set at Auto) and adjust the screen settings accordingly to reduce the soap opera effect effectively, and at the same time, have the capability to revert back to regular viewing settings afterwards (sources that are not film). For me, the Film Mode set at Auto isn't as good as Game Mode set manually for reducing the soap opera effect in movies, which means I have to manually set it with my remote control to Game Mode (for movies), which is sort of a hassle. Game Mode makes my movies look more normal, but doesn't look as good when changing the channel to non-movie channels (while still in the Game mode).  The soap opera effect with movies is an issue with all 120Hz LCD TV's. So, ya...

So far I am extremely pleased with it.  First off the base on this thing is heavy and secures firmly on the TV.  Some manufacturers will provide flimsy stands but Samsung didn't.  The shape is sort of awkward if you don't have a TV stand and have to place your boxes / sound bar behind or in front of it, but this is livable and won't even be a problem for most people.Next, this thing is thin.  This being only the second LED/LCD that I have purchased it is by far the thinnest I have seen for it's price.Picture quality is great.  With only a little bit of tweaking in the setup the picture is perfect.  This is one of those TVs, where if your new to HD it makes the image look so real it almost feels fake.  You can really tell the difference between the production quality of different TV shows and movies.  That being said there are downsides in the quality as well.  During dark scenes the LED backlights are the most apparent thing on the screen.Speakers on the TV are decent and don't require an upgrade like a lot of TVs.

It's an LED, 46\", slim and energy efficient TV.I received the item the Tuesday after Black Friday and was very excited to open it and set things up. After taking the proper steps to set things up I turned on the TV and my cable box and everything looked great. However after a while I noticed a small gray/black spot in the top right-hand corner whenever a lighter picture was being displayed on the screen. I thought it was just a smudge and grabbed the provided cleaning cloth to try and wipe it off. I attempted to wipe the spot away, but it didn't go away.I called Amazon to discuss the matter with them and ran through some troubleshooting steps to try and remove the spot. We completed the steps and the spot was still there. I was then transferred to another department to attempt to troubleshoot it further. This other department told me they couldn't do anything about the problem and that I would have to call the manufacturer.Long story short I wasn't happy with the outcome of calling the manufacturer so I called Amazon back except this time I requested a replacement. They were happy to help me and had another one shipped using one day shipping. I received it within two days and they also picked up the faulty one.As I was opening and assembling the replacement TV I found one of the bags had been opened already and the TV had finger prints along the frame. I'm a little frustrated that I payed (albeit discounted for Black Friday) for a new item yet received what seems like a used/refurbished item.Overall I suppose I'm pretty happy with the TV since the picture on the replacement TV is much better and working properly. However, I'm not sure I will be going to Amazon for my next TV purchase. Also, it may not necessarily have come from Amazon, it looks as though it may have been provided by Tiger Direct. Because of this suspicion I'm giving it a 3 out of 5.

So it's obvious that I would rather have a larger/thinner non LED TV over a smaller/smart feature set with 3D. Next are the smart features, I have a PS3 so it has all the smart features just about minus Skype as far as I know and I don't Skype anyway. I have also seen a few reviews stating the Samsung smart features on these mid tier sets are antiquated and slow. Again I don't need the redundancy of \"smart tv's\" and the aditional cost.Now the things I wanted in a TV was LED, Slim bezel, 120hz at least but could pass on the 240+ hz sets since I find that 120hz is adequate for action scenes and gaming, besides the human eye really only detects 60 fps. I looked at the UN46EH6000 and it was on sale for Black Friday around $550 or $600 IIRC. Anyway that thing was nearly 4\" thick and I wanted a set that was thinner, lighter, used less energy as in more up to date. I was sold on this set and having a Samsung LCD monitor and LCD TVs from them since 2005 I have always been pleased by them.PROS:Thin bezelLED back lightingSlim TV (1.8\" thin)120hzLow power consumptionAttractive price into an entry thin LED TVSpeakers surprisingly good for a thin LED TV.=Cons:Limited edition Black Friday TVOnly 2 HDMI portsOther:For those of you without a Wii/PS3/Xbox/Roku/etc... the smart features may be desired for things like netflix, YouTube, Skype, etc... If you don't need the smart features, save the cash and redundancy and get this set if you can still find it.No 3D, again this may be a con to some, a plus for the rest since it'll save you some $$$I will edit this review in a few weeks once I play some games and use the TV more.", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best all LED made tv on the market!", "Author": "VEGASGUY", "ReviewID": "R2ZXEKDH3QK6QD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One of the first truly all LED screen tv, not to be confused with LCD with LED back lights.

You can't go wrong with these large Samsung flat panels. They have fantastic pictures with outstanding color and resolution and black level. Blu-rays especially look and sound incredible on this machine. On a rare day off from work yesterday for Turkey Day I cranked up my home theater system which consists of a 55 in. 3d LED 240 HZ Samsung flat panel that is hung like a picture over my fireplace along with a set of DT (Definitive Technologies) bi-polar towers, and watched the mind-blowingly good blu-ray concert DVD of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame awards at Madison Square Garden. I sat there in my home theater lounger with a leftover turkey sandwich (oozing stuffing and gravy) like a king sitting on his throne and treated myself (and my entire neighborhood as I forgot that I had left the front door open) to \"see and hear God-like\" renditions of BB doing \"The Thrill is Gone\" with Stevie Wonder (you could hear every sweet guitar pick) and Simon and Garfunkle reuniting to do The Sounds of Silence and Bridge over Troubled Water (I know it doesn't sound that God-like but trust me when I tell you it was...it gave me goosebumps). The sound was remarkable and the resolution on the Samsung was incredible...they make a perfect pair. One thing I must mention, however. For those that can afford it, save up your sheckels to buy the model with the 240 Hz refresh rate...you won't be sorry you did. It makes it seem as if you are watching 50 year old James Bond 007 movies that look like modern day soap operas with the actors almost looking 3-dimensional! Also I highly recommend you get the models with the internet connectivity features if you can afford it. Kinda sweet watching your Youtube videos on a 55 in. flat panel through your home theater system...way cool. Bottom line...whether you go with the upgraded features or not you can't go wrong with any 55 in Samsung flat panel. Samsung is the premier manufacturer of affordably priced quality flat panel TV's. Don't waste your money on Vizio or LG or any of the other budget priced flat panels. They don't compare in overall quality and user satisfaction.", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "I like it", "Author": "rogelio", "ReviewID": "R1KB0VM78FW1AK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this 60 inch tv for 1350.00the reason i didn't give 5 stars because the shipping didn't have a tracking and the tiger direct costumer service is horrible.i spend more then 2 hrs on phone trying to contact them and still couldn't contact them.the shipping came a little late. package came on a small trailer truck and was in good condition.", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Didn't like the picture", "Author": "George J.

I would recommend reading reviews from people who have owned these models for a while as they can give you a better review than I can.BTW I switched to Directtv and I like the picture on all my TV's better than the one I had w/cable.", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Full HD 1080p\nClear Motion Rate 240\nUltra Slim Design\nWide Color Enhancer Plus\nTV with stand (Width x Height x Depth): 49.3-Inch x 31.8-Inch x 10.8-Inch, TV without stand (Width x Height x Depth): 49.3-Inch x 29-Inch x 1.8-Inch", "Name": "Samsung UN55ES6003 55-Inch 1080p 120Hz Slim LED HDTV (Black) (2012 Model)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/311BSL-6EmL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009VRTEPU"}}
