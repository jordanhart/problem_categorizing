{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great TV for the price", "Author": "Brooklyn Architect \"alexisk\"", "ReviewID": "RTR2OHCW4B8Z8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV last weekend, after the price dropped almost $300.  HDTV broadcasts, particularly from HBO and Showtime, look fantastic.  I've had a 20\" Proscan (hi-end RCA) television for 15 years, and this is a more than ample replacement.  The best featuers of the Proscan, picture brightness, clarity, and color correctness, are all there with the HP.  Color is, from what I've read, the most difficult picture issue for LCD technology.  HP has incorporated very detailed color set-up menus, allowing for fine adjustment.  However, at the touch of a button, the color and light settings provided by the AV Mode button on the remote are fine.Looking forward to baseball season!", "Date": "March 14, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great television", "Author": "Luke H. Klipp", "ReviewID": "R1FZ03NK3E81FP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the biggest, best television I've ever owned, and I'm no connoisseur of televisions either.  The picture is clear, the options plenty, with lots of input and output jacks in the back of the television so you can hook up your DVD, cable, computer, and a few other things.My only complaint at this point would be that the stereo audio hook-ups only work with an HDTV input, and, since our cable hook-up is not HDTV, we only get to use the two television speakers when watching cable - although we do have surround sound when watching DVDs.Overall, it's an excellent television and I HIGHLY recommend it.  We got it at a price lower than on Amazon, but I'd still consider it worth the list price on this site.", "Date": "January 19, 2006"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Built-in ATSC , QAM and NTSC tuners\n16 - 9 Aspect Ratio\nResolution up to 1366 x 768\n4000 - 1 Dynamic Contrast Ratio\nVisual Fidelity technology combines scene-by-scene contrast adaptation with ambient room lighting info, for an optimum picture anywhere", "Name": "HP Pavilion LC3200N 32\" LCD HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N4QNPFDBL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000AV4NFM"}}
