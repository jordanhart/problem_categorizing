{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Beware!  It doesn't last!", "Author": "S. Atkinson", "ReviewID": "R1LVA3100V69QK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After owning this tv for only seven months, the screen started getting brighter and brighter.  Some of the colors were washed out by the brightness.  If you're watching a cartoon, it looks like just an outline of the drawings with a light shade of yellow.  I tried adjusting the picture controls, but they didn't help.  I also called Sylvania's customer service for assistance.  The representative had me unplug the tv for five minutes and then turn it back on.  Once again, as the tv heated up, the screen got brighter.  Since this occured after the 90-day warranty, but within a year of purchase, Sylvania said they would replace the tv, but I would have to pay shipping and handling, which is around $40.  I originally purchased this tv on sale for $179 and now I would have to sink another $40 to receive a replacement, which may end with the same result since its the same brand & model.  I'm saving my money and purchasing a different brand during the holidays, when the prices drop.", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Silvania Pleases", "Author": "The Sphinx", "ReviewID": "R2UGGF2AGSLNCO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed a TV which would hang on the wall and be narrow enough not to protrude into the limited passage at the end of my bed. This model certainly satisfied all of my needs and expectations. The digital equipment fit onto it nicely. It produces good sound, true colors and a nice quality picture. I would recommend it, especially at the price I paid. I was most impressed with the quick delivery of this item! From the time I placed the order until it arrived at my door was only 48 hours!
