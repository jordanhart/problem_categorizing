Picture quality was most important to me, where I was willing to accept a plasma if it blew me away, but I was definitely siding towards LCD or LED. I wasn't too shocked to find that while plasmas were nice, they weren't \"that\" nice, and settled in to the Sharp.On my way out, I thought I'd check a couple of the 3D displays, just to be 100% sure I wasn't making a purchase I'd regret as soon as 3D content became more widespread. I looked at a couple of Panasonic models with active shutter glasses, and found that the 3D looked acceptable, but the glasses weren't comfortable on my head or to my eyes. A DirecTV rep all but insisted that I look at a high-end Samsung model connected to a DirecTV receiver, and I immediately noticed that getting the thing to display 3D apparently required messing with the DirecTV remote, the Samsung remote, and continually re-syncing the active glasses. \"No, thanks.\" I thought.Then I noticed an unloved LG display, with a bucket (yes, an actual bucket) of scratched passive glasses. No way was this going to look good, but it wasn't like I didn't have a few minutes to spare.I was absolutely blown away. By far, the best 3D experience I've seen. Standing about six feet from the screen, there was a scene from an IMAX documentary where a fish seriously looked like it came out about halfway between where I was standing, and where the TV was. And I could see parasitic fish on the nose of that fish, moving around. It was incredible, clear, and I knew it had to be pretty expensive. Much to my surprise, it was in the same league as the Panasonic models. I had to have it.Doing more research online, I saw that Amazon's price was even better (better, in fact, than a national warehouse club sells the non-3D version of this TV for). I ordered on a Monday, and scheduled my (free) shipping for Thursday afternoon. The delivery people came 15 minutes from the start of my four-hour delivery window, with no hassle at all.Out of the box, the picture quality on this TV is pretty awesome. Better than I remembered it being in the store, for sure. But, I did notice that motion seemed really... weird. I wasn't sure if it was my satellite receiver, or the TV, but things just didn't seem to move naturally. After spending some time adjusting the dejudder and deblur settings, I was able to make the motion normal. But then, I figured, I might as well calibrate everything. Using a combination of the calibration feature on the Life Blu-Ray and recommended settings on various forums, I was able to achieve an absolutely stunning picture. Seriously, this thing looks like it cost hundreds upon hundreds more when it's calibrated.1080i / 1080p content looked absolutely brilliant. SDTV, on the other hand, isn't the best I've seen. It's certainly acceptable, and arguably on the better side of what's commonly found on LCD / LED models, but I'd probably consider getting something different if most of your viewing is going to be sub-DVD quality content.Then it was time to break out the 3D. I snagged a copy of Tron: Legacy (Four-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy) and spent most of the movie sitting with a dumb smile on my face. The picture quality and depth were outstanding. Don't fall for the \"active / passive\" hype. Watching 3D content with the LG's passive glasses is certain to please anybody who can see. And going back to my memory of the Samsung set, when the LG detects 3D, a box pops up that tells you to put your glasses on. That's it. No messing around endlessly with modes to get it working.I then decided to play with the 2D-to-3D function on some HD channels and standard Blu-Ray discs, and was actually pretty surprised. More often than not, the TV seems to process the image as you'd expect to see 3D. It's not something I'd want to do all the time, but I have to say, watching Moulin Rouge! [Blu-ray] with 2D-to-3D was actually pretty awesome.The built-in applications were kind of a mixed bag. Getting the TV on my WPA2 wireless network was pretty simple, and the Wii-inspired remote worked better than I had expected. The Netflix and Amazon On Demand apps were both very solid -- arguably better than what you'd find on a Roku, and miles ahead of the ones built in to my Sony Blu-Ray player. The other apps were less than impressive. Bringing up the weather app is more time consuming than just tuning to the Weather Channel, for example. The included web browser is fine for \"Hey, look what my TV can do\" showing off, but you're probably not going to want to fire it up to look at IMDB in the middle of a show.All things considered, this is probably the best value around. While I lost 5\" of screen real estate over what I planned on buying originally, the difference in picture quality alone was a decent tradeoff. Getting 3D was gravy, to say the least. Unless this thing sets my house on fire, I'd be hard pressed to recommend anything else within a couple hundred dollars.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "UPDATE - ISSUES FIXED: Consider the 47\" model instead", "Author": "Reviewer", "ReviewID": "RXRG75B2DSE0L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "NOTE: See UPDATE below.  We've edited this review because all the initial concerns we had about this TV have been addressed and corrected with a few simple steps.  So, feel free to skip down to the bottom to see what we did to make this TV look AMAZING!  :-)------------------------------------------------------------I just learned a couple of things.First of all, I learned that bigger is not always better.We had purchased the 47\" version of this TV ([...]) and were absolutely blown away by the image quality... it is PRISTINE!  (Easily a 5-star+ set.) In fact, we were so pleased with that unit that we thought we might want just a slightly larger TV instead. So, we ordered the 55\" model and planned on returning the 47\" one. Well, amazingly, we're sending back the 55\" TV. The image is noticeably less pristine (grainy/pixelated/dull - even on the highest resolution blu-ray content... and even more surprisingly, the 3D was making us sick. (So strange, since we totally LOVED the 3D on the 47\" model.) Too bad... because we were really excited about the larger size... but we'd much rather have quality over quantity.Interestingly, it was my wife (who claims to not notice the \"soap opera effect\" of the new LCDs) who was most disturbed by the quality loss.  It was glaringly obvious to her (as it was to me... though I didn't want to admit it, since I really wanted the larger model).  If my wife notices the difference, trust me... it's there.  I later did a side-by-side comparison between the 55LW5600 and the 47LW5600 which confirmed our suspicions.Here's a little more detail:IMAGE QUALITY:On this 55\" model, image quality of even the highest resolution blu-ray discs was noticably less sharp, more pixelated/grainy, and overall just more dull.  I played extensively with the settings but could not overcome these issues.Alternatively, images on the 47\" model and crisp and GORGEOUS.  My hunch is that the resolution on both units is identical, but it is spread over a greater screen area on the larger unit, resulting in the ability to more easily see image flaws.  I have not found specs to confirm this, though.  We sit about 10-12 feet away from the TV, and we did notice a significant improvement in our perception of the image quality when moving back about 5 feet.  But, the arrangement of our room does not allow us to sit this distance from the TV... so the 47\" is the obvious choice for us.I would say that you should not consider the 55\" version if you intend on sitting closer than 12 feet to the TV.  Further out than that, you may have a better experience.3D EFFECT:I also learned that 3D can (under certain circumstances) make us sick.  Strange, because we've always enjoyed 3D in the theater... and we absolutely LOVED 3D on the 47\" version of this TV.  But, on this 55\" model, there were some strange fluttering effects, especially in fast-motion video.  We also noticed some kind of strange boxy/pixelated effect during quick scene changes, or when going from bright to dark (and vice versa) scenes.None of these 3D issues occurred with the 47\" version.  In fact, not only was the image impeccable, but the 3D looked absolutely gorgeous (and appeared to be fully HD quality with no noticeable resolution loss).So, if you're debating (like we did) about whether to go with LG's 47\" version (47LW5600), or to go a little larger with the 55\" model... I'd suggest sticking with the 47\" TV unless you will be sitting a fairly significant distance away from the set.So, what else did I learn?  It turns out my wife's a videophile!  Who knew?!?  :-)------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE - ISSUES FIXED:We have found ways to make adjustments that have COMPLETELY ELIMINATED the issues we spoke of earlier!!  So we have now changed our star rating from 2 to 5.  (Yeah, it's that much of an improvement!)  :-)2D IMAGE FIX: Just wanted to let everyone know that I was able to improve the 2D video quality of this 55\" model SIGNIFICANTLY by using the settings given on hometheater.com [hometheater+dot+com].  (Just search for \"LG 55LW5600 3D LCD HDTV\".) Blu-rays now look extremely good... and MUCH better than the default settings.3D IMAGE FIX: Additionally, we found a setting on the TV that allows you to adjust the 3D image in such a way that it positions the image further back into the screen (essentially virtually giving us the additional 3 feet back we felt we needed to eliminate eye-strain and nausea). To access, simply click the quick menu button *while 3D content is onscreen*. Then, select the top option to adjust the 3D settings. From there, the bottom option allows you to send the 3D image further back (to the left) or you can also bring it further forward going the other direction. We found the setting of \"-5\" (about half way to the left) to be a good compromise, improving the 3D image for us immensely (so that we no longer felt nauseous when viewing) and still kept us from seeing ghosting. (Going all the way to the left introduced some faint ghosting and didn't seem to be necessary since adjusting it half-way seemed to alleviate the sickness we felt when watching 3D content.)So, with that, and the video settings we found at hometheater+dot+com (Amazon keeps removing my link, hopefully my pseudo-URL will work for now), we have now fallen in love with the 55\" model.Our FINAL VERDICT, then, is that the 47\" model is better out-of-the-box. Plug it in and WOW! However, while the 55\" model requires a little more work, it can eventually look every bit as good as the 47\" set.  It is truly STUNNING!  So, we are keeping the 55\" set after all, and are extremely happy with it.  It took a little extra work, but it was well worth it.Hopefully our trial-and-error helps someone out there. :-) Enjoy!", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Great Value", "Author": "Robert \"Flightdog\"", "ReviewID": "R1TS8W6URP0I7J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Summary - This is a good buy if you are looking for a LED Television with 3D and internet capability.Background - This television is mounted on the provided stand and placed on top of a media chest. The television sits above the seated viewers. Replaces a 5 year old 40\" Sony Bravida LCD panel. Connected to a HD TiVo and a Sony Blu Ray.Set-Up - Fast and easy. The manual is adequate, but not excellent. The \"Pro\" video set-up is a nice feature and gets the picture looking its best quickly. The HDMI cables come out of the back of the television at a right angle on the left side rear. Placement is not optimal since HDMI cables have a tendency to be stiff and sharp bends are not recommended. There is enough room to make the gentle bend and align the cables, but tie wraps are a must for more than one cable.Stand - Basic. Swivels right to left, but a tilt feature should have been included. See comments about 3D for explanation. A cable management slot on the stand would also have been nice to clean-up the cables for those who are not wall mounting.Picture - Sharp and clear. No motion artifacts. Superior to the Sony it replaces, but this was expected due to the technology improvements since the purchase of the Sony.Sound - Decent for ultra-thin panel televisions. If you are looking for audio quality, I recommend an external amplifier and speakers. For normal viewing, the sound is acceptable and voices are clear.3D Blu ray - Comparable to my expensive active 3D television without the flicker and associated issues. Although the picture quality is not as high, I challenge most viewers to tell the difference. As stated in other reviews, there is some ghosting if the television tilt does not point the television straight at the viewer (A tilting stand would have been a nice feature for LG to add, but alas, it only swivels!). To the right and left of the television, there is no degradation of the 3D experience.2D to 3D - This television does a superior job of converting 2D into 3D. It seems to excel when the film has depth of field and the less action, but the overall experience is very good. Based on my prior experience with my Active 3D television, I expected far less and found this to be a compelling 3D experience.Internet TV - Linked to Amazon.com quickly and easily. Netflix was also excellent. Some buffering issues left me wishing that the television stored more of he content locally as the video streamed. Web Browsing was less than adequate and I did not find it a useful experience, with the television not always responding to the commands of the remote. Apps are limited and it made me wonder why someone does not develop an Android based television or a iOS based television so that there could be more Aps to access.Remote - The standard remote is decent and well laid out, but unless you own LG components, you will have to have multiple remotes. A learning remote would have been a nice feature. Key back-light is dimmer than I would like.Magic Wand Remote - Think Wii controller for a television. Similar to other people, I had trouble with the response of the remote and found it worked best when I was sitting straight in front of the television. I felt that the software could use further optimization and I don't see this currently as product differentiation and I would not buy this television for this capability alone.Recommendation - I would recommend this television and I am satisfied with the purchase.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "LGs lack of audio support made me say 3 stars", "Author": "RCD", "ReviewID": "RBN4142U0BE85", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I hope this helps someone.So, with my TV already ordered and on its way, I stumbled upon the \"Audio down-converting issue\". If you search through the reviews both here and elsewhere you will find many people having an issue with the surround sound signal coming from their source (STB, DVD, PS3, Etc.)  being down-converted to 2 channel by the TV. Makes sense if using the TV speakers but if your like most people, you want to use your surround receiver. You would think that you could simply turn off the TV speakers and allow the full audio signal to \"pass through\" the TV and out of the optical audio port. Unfortunately, the TV does not allow it to fully pass through the optical audio out and instead it stays a 2 channel signal. I called LG multiple times and it is very obvious that this is something that they are fully aware of and can't/won't really help with. In fact, I have seen where previous models have had it for quite some time and some 2012 models will have it again. LG could fix this by way of an update for this model but said they will not. Sounded like it was due to cost. One LG person told me of a procedure that could be physically performed by a tech that could allow AC3 surround to pass through but they couldn't guarantee the result ? This is why I could only rate the TV at 3 stars for picture only.So, after receiving my TV, I tried to run video to the TV by way of the source HDMIs (my receiver does not have HDMI to pass through) and the source optical audios to my receiver. This has worked fine for me with my other TV for years with no issues. However, now this created a syncing issue between the sound and the picture on the LG 55LW5600. In my case, the sound was slightly ahead of the picture. I understand now from my extensive thread readings that this is actually a fairly common problem for people with this configuration and in many cases, the reason they were unhappy with the TV. I really liked the TV's picture and the 3D is way cooler than I expected. I did not want to return it, but there was no way I wanted a beautiful 55\" picture with 2 channel audio. I began to consider buying a new receiver with HDMI/3D pass through to hopefully fix the problem and allow me to keep the TV. When speaking to an audio salesman at a well known company, he asked why I didn't adjust the audio timing in my existing receiver ? Although I saw the \"audio adjust\" responses here and there in threads, I just figured that it must be something new and didn't know that my receiver even had it. Turns out that my 7 year old Sony receiver actually had a feature under the \"custom\" set-up that slightly retards the audio output. The manual even states that it is for this type of issue specifically. It lacks the adjustability that some of the newer receivers have (just a preset millisecond on/off adjustment), but it worked great. I have gone through my channels and checked several DVDs to confirm. The reason I am writing this is because I spent alot of time reading through forums to find a solution to this and for the most part only saw the complaints. Apparently many Dolby Digital and DTS capable receivers have this adjustment. Thanks to Amazon, I still have plenty of time to keep an eye (and ear) on this, but I am thinking I have an acceptable solution.I should mention that LG did say that the digital optical out would support surround when streaming with net flicks, etc. Did not try it myself.", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "M.

If you don't believe me do a side by side comparison at your local electronic store. Yes, you do have half the resolution when viewing in 3D, but you will not be able to tell.  The pixels are spilt in half from 1080 to 540, but you see both halves of a 540 image at the same time giving you that full HD illusion. It's amazing! I have 20/20 vision and sit 7ft away from my TV and I see no jagged edges. I have heard the bigger the TV the worse the picture looks in 3D with passive technology. I was sold after looking at the 55\" at the electronic store. It is every bit of the 3D experience you'll find in an active 3D set if not better and more natural like the theaters. Check it out for yourself.  I purchased this 47\" lw5600 and am very pleased.However, there is some negatives about this TV which is why I gave it 4 stars.1) The magic motion controller is to horrible for browsing the web. It's worthless, think about having to point at every single letter of a word you want to spell out. Don't even get me started on scrolling down a page. I almost developed turrets syndrome trying to use this thing. I've given up trying, so I just connected my laptop to the TV so I can use my wireless mouse and keyboard to surf the web.  -1/2 STARS2) The stand is cheap. It looks good but the TV will wobbles when you move it. Don't worry its not going to break but LG could have just put a little more effort in this TV's stand. However, I do like that it swivels. -1/4 STARS3) This TV must be at eye level. 3D images will start ghosting if you looking down or up at this TV.

(No above the fireplace mounting here) There is almost no ghosting at all, even on content which contains crosstalk on my 3-D plasma.  Resolution IS reduced (I can easily tell) but it isn't that bad and as long as you sit far enough away from the set, you won't see scan lines.  The 3-D from blu-ray 3D is bright and of course the polarized glasses are lightweight and easily replaceable. Directv's 3-D channels are bit softer on this set but still acceptable.Is it as good as my active 3-D set? Not quite, as the active has better picture quality, but the passive set comes out on top even over the plasma as far as lack of ghosting/crosstalk goes. I think most casual 3-D viewers would be quite pleased. 2-D to 3-D conversion is probably the best I've seen also, though I would rarely use this feature.I wouldn't call active obsolete (after all, 3-D content works on either kind of set, just as you can choose between LCD, plasma or DLP, you can choose active or passive) but if they can get the resolution to be better (full 1080p in both eyes) I would expect the market to go in the passive direction.2-D picture is excellent, and the various apps and internet features are well executed.", "Date": "April 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "lg 3d tv", "Author": "J.

I also put there claims to the test. I was able to see 3D from any angle except laying on the floor, but i have a swivel  and tilt mount that with 10seconds to adjust  will tilt if i wanted to lay down. Note- the mount was overkill as it looks heavy duty and rated to hold 167 lbs. Tv only weighs 50 something punds.

No sickness, little to no eye strain and a great 3d image. People have complained that the way the 3d is created halves the resolution, this is not noticeable at all with 3d blu-ray. I did notice lining in the image when i was very close to the tv, closer than I would want to sit comfortably. One complaint I have, though it is a small one, is that 3d gaming is noticeably lower in resolution.

I finally decided that the LG 47LW5600 was the best TV I found, not even considering the price (which is a steal in my opinion!).I went to a certain major box store to compare this set to some other active 3D sets, and enjoyed LG's passive 3D hands down. Not only are the glasses more comfortable and MUCH cheaper, but the 3D on this set just seemed to have much more 'pop' to it. The active sets were ok, but the glasses I tried were uncomfortable, and on top of it all, active 3D just didn't seem to have the same depth to it. I had also read about passive 3D losing the HD quality and some people noticing resolution lines. That's the primary reason I wanted to see it for myself. What I noticed in store and at home is that if you sit within a few feet of the screen, the lines do become slightly apparent in still shots. However, as I backed up to a normal viewing distance for this set (7-12ft), I no longer noticed any diminished quality. In addition to content produced in 3D, this TV will also convert 2D content to 3D, which I first thought would be marginal at best. After using this set for a few weeks now, I have come to enjoy this feature much more than I imagined I would and often don my 3D glasses for Netflix, cable, and non 3D-encoded movies. While not as good as 3D encoded content, the TV does do an amazing job of converting. Finally on 3D, make sure you get an HDMI 1.4 cable for 3D content, and should you need more than the included 4 glasses, pick up a few more for cheap!Yes, the 3D is great and I just spent a good long paragraph praising it, but the other features and overall picture quality also deserve similar praise. Brightness, contrast, black levels, and just about everything else are superb. The LED's allow the TV to produce quality blacks with no graying, no flashlight effect, and just an overall good, crisp, clean picture. The picture wizard does a great job of allowing you to adjust the settings for an optimal viewing experience for your room. The smart TV features are good, but could certainly use some improvement (hopefully more apps to come in the future). I mostly just use it to Netflix, but you can YouTube, check the weather, and other things I haven't explored. The TV includes an Ethernet port for internet, as well as a wireless dongle should you prefer fewer wires poking into the back of your TV.Overall, I would recommend this TV to anyone, hands down.

Just like in the movies. It leaps out at you. I bought the Canyon DVD and the water bubbles just float in front of you and water splashing made me blink! We also bought Step Up 3D and it was just like seeing it at the movies. The picture is very bright and looks beautiful. If you are concerned that you will not see \"full 1080P\" because of the technology don't be. I watched that same Canyon DVD in store with the active shutter glasses and saw zero difference in quality.I played a little bit of Call of Duty Black Ops on my PS3 to see what the gaming side looked like and it seems to only work with the story mode, but woah 3D gaming is wicked. It's like playing a video through a view master.The 2D pictureIs excellent. We had a 50\" Sony LCD 1080i and this picture is far superior. There's a certain realism that comes through. We noticed it first at our local Best Buy store. Some TVs looked as if the content was taken like from live TV and we were pleased to see this TV also producing this type of picture.As for the 2D to 3D, I tried it on a show being shown in HD and saw no difference. I will experiment more with it now that I see others having success with this feature.It has a bunch of other goodies like Netflix, YouTube etc. The USB internet \"card\" (like a thumb drive device) plugs in the back and the TV recognizes it. Going to the Network set up I easily connected to my home's WiFi and had my Netflix account up in a flash. You can go on Youtube, but I saw no way to log in to my account so if you have subscriptions or your videos this is not your best way to check those out. The browser works fine, but doesn't have Flash and I'm not sure if it is or will be supported. The TV comes with two remotes, the smaller works like the Wii controller so you have a mouse-like interface, pretty cool. There are other apps and games, but I have not played with those yet.Negatives so farOne thing that was disappointing to me is that there is no RCA (Red/White) audio outs from the TV. Just an optical audio out. My surround sound system doesn't have an optical in so I can't use it with the TV.Also the remote doesn't have separate source buttons to quickly jump from one input to another (Cable to DVD for example). You have to press the one \"Input\" button which takes you to a screen that lets you choose. One nice touch however is that it seems to sense when you turn something on. For instance, if Im watching Cable TV then I turn the DVD/Blueray player on the TV \"sees\" this and switches to the new source (DVD player) automatically.These are my initial (and lengthy) impressions so far. In short, I'm really impressed with the quality picture of this TV and the technology it uses.

I think samsung has done exceptional job on this regard this year.I was mainly looking closely how the 3d performs as 2d area is already good on todays tvs.overall, lg gave more comfortable, flicker-free, bright, and best of all, natural 3d experence.If i didnt compare directly, I also would have liked samsung as samsung didnt feel much of a flickering or cross talks if any.but when seen side by side, the difference is apparent easily.lg gave not only natural, comfortable image on the screen, its hard to put in words, but overall everything feels simply simplified and just comfortable to watch.Compare to lg, samsung gave rather darker image, too.also, for fast moving scene samsung give a little judder looking artifacts as if the glass shutter couldnt catch up the speed of the scene. Whereas lg simply doesnt have issue with having passive system.some people say passive cuts resolusion in halves so you see lines between lines.you do see these line when you get really close to the tv. But when sit back farther distance you would normally watch, thses little lines disapper.  But just like you know shutter glass are flickering in front of your eyes, and it makes you uncomfortable, this lines on lg, even though might not visible in normal distance, might make you uncomfortable.so I think which one you value more.To me, lg has overall better image on my eyes, that is, no flicker or crosstalk whatsoever, much bright image, and natural viewing without feeling of any artifacts.I guess I can summarize like this.samsung feels like some high tech glass is doing fine job in front of your eyes to create 3d, and lg simply feel you're not wearing any glasses at all. when you are immersed into the content, glass simply disappears from your awareness.I highly recommand this tv.", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "UPDATE: MUCH better than the 55\" model - comparison", "Author": "Reviewer", "ReviewID": "R3116RLOVAWY4H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, I just learned that bigger is not always better.We had purchased this 47\" version of LG's new passive 3D line and were absolutely BLOWN AWAY by the image quality... it is PRISTINE!  (Easily a 5-star+ set.) In fact, we were so pleased with that unit that we thought we might want just a slightly larger TV instead. So, we ordered the 55\" model (55LW5600) and planned on returning the 47\" one.Well, amazingly, we're sending back the 55\" TV. The image is noticeably less pristine (grainy/pixelated/dull - even on the highest resolution blu-ray content... and even more surprisingly, the 3D was making us sick. (So strange, since we totally LOVE the 3D on the 47\" model.) Too bad... because we were really excited about the larger size... but we'd much rather have quality over quantity.(Interestingly, it was my wife - who claims to not notice the \"soap opera effect\" of the new LCDs - who was most disturbed by the quality loss.  It was glaringly obvious to her (as it was to me... though I didn't want to admit it, since I really wanted the larger model).  If my wife notices the difference, trust me... it's there.  I later did a side-by-side comparison between the 55LW5600 and the 47LW5600 which confirmed our suspicions.)Here's a little more detail:IMAGE QUALITY:On the 55\" model, image quality of even the highest resolution blu-ray discs was noticably less sharp, more pixelated/grainy, and overall just more dull.  I played extensively with the settings but could not overcome these issues.Alternatively, images on this 47\" model are crisp and GORGEOUS.  My hunch is that the resolution on both units is identical, but it is spread over a greater screen area on the larger unit, resulting in the ability to more easily see image flaws.  I have not found specs to confirm this, though.  We sit about 10-12 feet away from the TV, and we did notice a significant improvement in our perception of the image quality when moving back about 5 feet.  But, the arrangement of our room does not allow us to sit this distance from the TV... so the 47\" is the obvious choice for us.I would say that you should not consider a larger version of this TV if you intend on sitting closer than 12 feet to the set.  Further out than that, you may have a better experience.3D EFFECT:I also learned that 3D can (under certain circumstances) make us sick.  Strange, because we've always enjoyed 3D in the theater... and we absolutely LOVE 3D on the 47\" version of this TV.  But, on the 55\" model, there were some strange fluttering effects, especially in fast-motion video (using 3D blu-rays as our video source).  We also noticed some kind of strange boxy/pixelated effect during quick scene changes, or when going from bright to dark (and vice versa) scenes.None of these 3D issues occurred with this 47\" version.  In fact, not only was the image impeccable, but the 3D looked absolutely gorgeous (and truly appeared to be fully HD quality - despite the controversy to the contrary -  with no noticeable resolution loss at all).VERDICT:So, if you're debating (like we were) about whether to go with LG's 47\" version (47LW5600), or to go a little larger with the 55\" model... we'd suggest sticking with the 47\" TV unless you will be sitting a fairly significant distance away from the set.  Otherwise, this 47\" model is THE NEW STANDARD by which TVs (anywhere near this price range) will be judged going forward.  Enjoy!Oh... so what else did I learn?  It turns out my wife's a videophile!  Who knew?!?  :-)------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE:I was able to improve the 2D video quality of the 55\" model significantly by using the settings given on hometheater.com ([...]).  Blu-rays now look extremely good... perhaps still not quite as good as the 47\" version, but MUCH better than the default settings.  So much improved, in fact, that if we only wanted the TV for 2D viewing, I would no longer hesitate to keep the 55\" version.Alas, though the 3D image quality has improved on the 55\" set with the new settings, you still really need to be a minimum of 13-15 feet away from the set to keep your eyes from wigging out when viewing objects that are closest to you in 3D space.  Objects that go back into the screen fare the best, and border on stunning... the closer the object to the viewer, the more likely eye-strain/sickness will result.Again, none of these issues were experienced with this 47\" set.  This has made the decision on which set to keep much more difficult.  For now, 3D is an important enough feature for us to keep us leaning toward keeping this 47\" set.  Decisions, decisions...  :-)------------------------------------------------------------FINAL UPDATE:Well, we found a setting on the larger 55\" TV (which is also present on the 47\" model) that allows you to adjust the 3D image in such a way that it positions the image further back into the screen (essentially virtually giving us the additional 3 feet back we felt we needed).  To access, simply click the quick menu button *while 3D content is onscreen*.  Then, select the top option to adjust the 3D settings.  From there, the bottom option allows you to send the 3D image further back (to the left) or you can also bring it further forward going the other direction.  We found the setting of \"-5\" (about half way to the left) to be a good compromise, improving the 3D image for us immensely (so that we no longer felt nauseous when viewing) and still kept us from seeing ghosting.  (Going all the way to the left introduced some faint ghosting and didn't seem to be necessary since adjusting it half-way seemed to alleviate the sickness we felt when watching 3D content.)  So, with that, and the video settings we found at hometheater.com, we have now fallen in love with the 55\" model.So, our FINAL VERDICT is that the 47\" model is better out-of-the-box.  Plug it in and WOW!  The 55\" model requires a little more work, but it can eventually look every bit as good as the 47\" set.Hopefully our trial-and-error helps someone out there.  :-)  We're extremely happy with our decision now.", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Feature rich for a competitive price point!", "Author": "John I. Gonzales", "ReviewID": "RSVBXFOZL6ULQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went round and round with what to buy in Late October 2011. Sony, Samsung, Sharp... actually I looked at all the brands. Dollar for dollar, feature for feature.... I boiled it down to this LG 55LW5600 3D HDTV.For $1300 I was able to get a 55\" 3d HDTV with just about all the bells and whistles. The TV has been in use for about 2 months now and I absolutely love it! Here were my main decision points;1) Price - Dollar for dollar the other name brands could not stack up. LG represented the best overall value PLUS LG offers a factory direct extended warranty for a cheaper price than anyone else. For 5 years of LG \"in home\" coverage I paid $179. Sony, Samsung, etc does not offer factory direct warranties.2) Type of 3D - You have a choice... active shutter 3D or passive 3D (like at the movie theater). After reading reviews and all of the PROs and CONs I opted to go with passive 3D. If the movies I see at the theater are in passive 3D then that is good enough for me. BUT more importantly I had to consider 2 things.... vision strain/headaches and cost of glasses. Passive 3D is a winner in both categories. Less overall eye strain when compared to active shutter plus the glasses are dirt cheap. In my honest opinion, passive 3D is the way to go. In the future 3D viewing will not require glasses (new technology is being developed).... until then you only have these two choices.3) Features - I wanted \"Smart TV\", 3D, great picture and a thin TV to mount on my wall. I got all of that and then some. One cool feature is the LG Magic Remote that is included. It is like a wireless mouse when you want to get online from your TV and go to Netflix, Amazon Videos, surfing, etc. This is a very nice controller to have for surfing on your Smart TV. The only thing that this did not have on it was a 240 Hz refresh rate... which from what I have read is more marketing hype than a usable feature. From what I read on the subject is that the 120Hz refresh rate is the \"natural\" refresh rate for the human eye... anything more or less than that starts to create artifacts in your viewing. Regardless of the technical truth to that I overlooked that \"hot advertised feature\" for two reasons.... most TVs are still sporting a 120Hz refresh rate, second - my TV looks great! PLUS I have a long background in the electronics retail world.... and if there is anything that I understand is marketing hype. LOL, if the average customer only knew the truths of their favorite brands \"marketing claims\" they would be shocked! So the debate over 120Hz vs 240Hz means very little to me since my 120 looks great out of the box!Overall, all things considered, this LG 55LW5600 is a home run! Throw in a factory backed 5 year extended warranty for only $179.... I have a great theater setup and piece of mind... at a price that I can actually be happy with!I hope this review helps!

It's amazingly thin and light and produces a very good picture in most circumstances. 3D mode is great on movies designed for 3D. 3D mode is an okay novelty at best for all other movies and programming not designed for 3D. Passive glasses are cheap, so this TV is a great way for families to go 3D.When connected to the internet this Smart TV offers a lot of great features. For example, you can stream movies from NetFlix (for about $11 per month, including physical DVD rental), watch movies on YouTube, or find your way around the world using Google Maps.The magic wand remote is pretty cool (it's like a Wii remote) but it doesn't work in NetFlix, which is too bad.For normal everyday viewing you'll likely be impressed with the picture quality. One problem with side-lit LED TVs in general, and with this one in particular, is that the lighting from the side can cause areas that should be dark to be very light. For example, when there's something light in the middle of a dark screen you'll see a lot of lightness from the sides all the way to the light object in the middle of the screen. This creates a \"band\" of light across the screen. On a back-lit LCD TV or plasma TV this isn't an issue. But since the major design goal of side-lit TVs is to make them as thin - from front to back - as possible, it's a necessary tradeoff that may result in a lower viewing experience. This can be mitigated somewhat using the local dimming feature on the TV. Some people may not notice this problem at all, even when it's really evident. I had to point it out to my wife, for example. And a lot of kids probably won't notice. But anyone who's pretty critical of display quality will notice it within a few seconds while watching dark scenes in a movie.So, that's side lighting, which you should know about when buying this TV. Not a problem if your expectations are set correctly.Here's the problem, though: If you watch dark scenes in the standard picture mode, you'll get a lot of flashing from light to dark and back. I'm not sure which particular setting causes this problem, but the problem goes away in cinema mode. (I do know the problem has nothing to do with energy saving mode because I've had that turned off since day 1). Of course, in cinema mode you have to be watching in complete darkness to see anything at all in a dark scene. There may be a setting which allows for a brighter picture without the dark/light flashing problem, I just haven't figured it out yet, even after an email and telephone call to LG tech support. If there was no way to watch without this flashing problem occurring I would assume that the TV was defective. But since there are settings that fix the problem (e.g. the default cinema mode settings), the problem probably cannot be defined as a defect. I would think that standard picture mode would be pretty forgiving in all scenarios. It isn't.So, if you understand side-lit LED LCD TVs and the implications of a super thin cabinet design on screen lighting, then you'll really appreciate this 3D Smart TV.*** Update 7 Months Later ***We still really like this TV. We liked it so much we got another one for the bedroom about a month ago. No complaints, although the dark scene issue is still a little bothersome at times in standard picture mode. Sound could be better, but it's good enough so that we haven't purchased a sound bar or home theater system, which we had planned on buying initially. You just can't go wrong with this TV. Still 4 stars. It would be 5 stars (easily) if it didn't have the dark scene problem described above.", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Passive 3D", "Author": "Cody G Culwell", "ReviewID": "R73QXHHFE389G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this TV for about 2 weeks now and continue to be impressed. I first got a glimpse of the TV and its technology at the LG demonstration at BracketTown in Houston during the Final Four, and I was hooked.

You cannot see any difference in the resolution when watching a 3D as some have mentioned (supposed half resolution with the 3D). So far my family has watched Tron Legacy, Tangled and Despicable Me in 3D and it rocks.  The 2D picture is also clear, and I have only occasionally noticed the lines that some others have complained about. I haven't seen them on any true 1080p content. Instead they rarely show up on Internet content such as Netflix and iTunes downloaded content that generally lacks as much clarity anyway.

BTW, prior to my purchase, I've been a proud owner of a Samsung 720p LCD TV of 8 years.The TV is great.  Passive 3D glasses FTW.  It really gives you a good feel for the depth of each element in the picture.  Viewing angle on the screen is pretty good too.  I have my living room set up so that a love seat is off to the side (perpendicular) to the TV and guests are still able to view the screen.  There is a 20degree float to both left and right sides of the TV.User interface is pretty straight forward.  I'm use to Samsung's but LG's interface isn't very far off from being the same.  My only problem is the lag between the remote control and the menu selection screen.  Sometimes, I'll click the down-arrow on the remote and nothing triggers on the screen so I have to press it an extra time.  IMO, that's very minor.Apps that I have tried are NetFlix, YouTube, Facebook, and Google Picasa.  These apps work very very well.  In addition to the remote control, LG has also bundled together a \"Wand\"-like remote control similar to the Nintendo Wii.  It runs on AA batteries and all you have to do is point your remote at the screen, press a button to activate, and a cross-hair comes up so you can select buttons on the screen.  Although, this is nothing new and groundbreaking, it is nice to see it integrated into a TV.The physical characteristics of the TV is amazing.  I see it in the stores as thin, but bringing it back home, i couldn't even see the TV looking at it directly from the side.  The 2D to 3D conversion works flawlessly.  I have over-the-air DTV and my fiance and I are just shocked at how simple free HDTV channels looked on the TV.  That's the best part about the TV, passive 3D glasses.  Now, I don't have to invest any money on those active shutter lenses.The TV is 120Hz and has a very fluid motion when characters move in scenes.  But it isn't over-the-top fluid like the Sony Bravias; I think those are just over kill to the point that the pictures don't look natural.Bottom line:  for $900 at frys electronics, it was the biggest bang for the buck.

I recently bought a 47\" 240HZ LG TV for my living room and am very happy with the quality of the image, lack of a glare from my windows (which is a huge negative with the highly reflective Samsung screen) and the fact I don't see the tv struggling to give me the clear image when watching a sporting event.  I hung the the 55\" in place of my 47\" to test it out before putting it in the basement and used it to watch the NCAA Finals.  The picture is big, but there is a noticable difference between the ability of this TV to draw the picture and my 47\".  The 55\" noticably messes up, or pixilates every now and then.  It isn't a show stopper, or a reason to hate the TV, but it is noticeable and I can't help but think the 120Hz for the 55\" television is the problem.  I tried the 3d conversion and it does add some nice depth.  I like it.  I plan to try it with some real 3D content to see if it is impressive.I am connected to the Internet and tried to use the browser to watch an episode of Castle from the ABC website.  The site told me to update my version of Flash and I have no idea how to do this since I don't know the operating system.

In this case, I felt compelled to share my experience with anyone that is trying to decide whether or not to purchase this item.  How my purchase started was by looking for an Xbox 360 bundle deal for my nephews for Christmas and I came across the LG+Xbox+Halo CE package deal from Amazon.  I wasn't really in the market for the new TV but I just thought this deal was too good to pass up.First, as always, I have to give my experience with my purchasing at Amazon a full 5 stars.  I have never had any problems purchasing anything I am looking for and being a prime member is always a plus as well.  So kudos to Amazon for such an easy site to navigate and making my purchase process so easy.Next, I have to say that I was a little wary about the home delivery service that Amazon uses for larger items such as TV's and appliances.  Let me say that all my concerns have been put to rest.  The company assigned to perform my delivery kept in communication prior to the day I selected as my delivery date.  The day the TV was delivered, I received a phone call right at the beginning of my slotted time from the driver stating that they were on their way and they were 30 minutes out.  Sure enough, they showed up right on schedule and were very professional.  They brought the television into my house and made sure that I was satisfied before they left.  The shipping company name was CEVA and I give them 5 stars for the experience with them as well.Finally, onto the TV!!!!!!!  Let me say that I am completely impressed with this television and I have only had it for 2 days.  Very easy to set up and connect all of my devices.  I did some research and found some preferred advanced video settings that I wanted to test and with some playing around, I was able to get my preferred settings and enjoy.  I was a little concerned about connecting to wireless due to some other reviews but all I did was search and put in my pass code and I was immediately connected in no time at all.  Some reviews also mentioned that the sound was well below par.  I found the sound to be very sufficient.  The room that I have it in is quite large(24X18), yet with the TV volume set to only 15, I can hear it all throughout the house.  Needless to say, there is about 35 levels more to go until it is up all the way.  I guess some may expect home theater sound or possibly they are hard of hearing.  Either way I found the audio to be above average.  The video quality is above and beyond what I was expecting.  I am upgrading from a 3 year old Sharp Aquos 46\" LCD which I thought was a great TV but the LG has brighter colors, darker blacks and just a sharper picture all around.  I have only been able to test the 3D on a few video games but it is amazing.  I like the passive 3D over the active because I did not experience any headache even after player for a half hour straight.  With the active glasses I tried at a friend's, I had a headache after 10 minutes so that is definitely a plus.If you have any doubts about this TV, please take it from me when I say you will not be disappointed.  I have friends that have spent almost twice as much as I did and I can say that I think I made the right choice.  The only thing that I may regret is going with the 5600 rather than the 6500.  But from everything I read and what I will be using it for, I just didn't see a need to get the 240Hz over the 120Hz.

Vibrant, but reasonable color, good default settings, solid contrast.  I'm still waiting for OLED TVs, but this is very good.The best image processing options on any TV.  Hook up your set-top, laptop, or other computer via HDMI, hit Q.MENU on the remote, and then choose one of the bottom 2 \"expert\" image modes.  As far as I can tell, this is the only line of TVs that allow you to totally disable sharpening when set to 50.  In expert mode, you can even adjust settings for vertical and horizontal processing.  My head asplod.  Sony and Samsung can disable sharpening, but they incorrectly display text, so you'll get red and blue fringing on text that has ClearType enabled over HDMI.  I guess they expect you to use the RGB input, but why would you want to and lose the pure digital connection + audio?  There is a way to modify ClearType, but it does not seem to have an effect.  Better to just get a TV that works.The matte screen is terrific.  Yes, glossy screens look good in the store, but there is a reason they are called \"glare-type\" screens by some companies.  I'm so glad LG is not using a glossy screen as we have plenty of mirrors in the house already.  I'd rather see a movie without seeing the room reflected on the screen.The remotes are solid.  Ours came with a full featured remote, and a small Wiimote-style remote.  The Wiimote seemed a little questionable at first, but it's been great as it communicates with RF (radio frequency) and does not need to be aimed at the TV at all to use it.  When that obnoxious ad comes on at 200% volume, you can just mash the volume down button with the puny remote right on your coffee table.  No need to grab the remote, aim it at the TV, and then hit the volume button.  It also provides a mouse cursor on-screen for those of you who need to watch YouTube through your TV.  The IR emitter on the normal, full featured remote is also very powerful (unlike some Samsung remotes); you can use it at random angles and it often surprises us.Input handling is very intelligent.  Turn on a digital device and the TV will ask you if you want to switch to it on a small pop-up dialogue.  Chances are, if you just turned on your PS3, you will probably be using it.  Unlike the obtuse Samsung interface, you can force the TV to switch to an input that does not have any connection detected; sometimes, you need the TV to be \"ready and waiting\" on an input so that you can see what appears on-screen right when the device is turned on (e.g. early rolling movie previews, computer bootup BIOS screens, etc.).  This LG lets you do that.3D gaming works perfectly.  At any decent viewing distance, the resolution difference is not noticeable compared to active shutter glasses.  The 3D performance of console systems is another story.The 3D image is silky smooth and natural, unlike the jittery and unstable 3D image exhibited on some active shutter systems.  The glasses are feather light, cheap as hell, can be easily washed/cleaned (no electronics) and don't look incredibly lame.Metal back construction makes it surprisingly tough and durable.  Ours took a hit during delivery, but shrugged it off with a dent but no impact on performance.LED backlight means lower temperatures (nice in the summer), no potential mercury leak, and a longer theoretical life.Relatively frequent firmware updates pushed out by LG.  I'm guessing most of these are for the web services that I never use since we have a computer hooked up to it anyways.  Either way, it's nice to have a supported product.Stable firmware.  It's sad that this is even an issue for a TV, but our previous TV was a buggy joke of a product.  I'm surprised a TV needs reboots, but our Samsung did.  This LG, while significantly more sophisticated, has been totally reliable.  I dread the day my toaster will need a reboot.Active volume control is surprisingly useful when you want to hear dialogue in a movie without a 120 db explosion blowing out your eardrums.Solid reliability.  \"A leading consumer magazine which accepts no advertising\" and, uh, rhymes with consumer reports lists LG in the same top tier as Sony.Minuses:The thin side profile is cool the first time you see it, but the high price is the lack of effective local dimming.  It's not as impressive as some full-array TVs.  I'd much rather have a thicker profile and have a full array. Plus, I'm guessing that the thin profile is responsible for the relatively sparse input/output options.  Form over function, unfortunately.  I don't spend a lot of time looking at my TV from the side, so it's not exactly mission critical if it's 1 or 1.5 inches thick.  I'd much rather have better image quality, better speakers, and more input options.You'll sometimes notice faint horizontal lines if you have sunlight or light of a certain polarization bouncing off the screen.  This is with 3D *disabled* and glasses off.  It's not a big deal.4 HDMI inputs might be enough for some.  It's not enough for others.  Blame the anorexic look!No S-VHS inputs.  Yeah, these are a dying breed, but still useful at times for that old game console (is a Wii old?) or DVD player.  I wouldn't pay extra for these, but I wouldn't mind if they were there.Other observations:Optical-only audio outputs.  This will work for people with modern receivers, but more options are usually welcome.  As a workaround, there is a variable headphone output which cuts out the TV's built-in speakers and can be used with a miniplug-to-RCA cable.Built-in speakers are decent, but nothing exceptional.  Again, I blame the supermodel-thin profile.  Not a big deal as anyone spending these kind of bucks on a TV would probably have at least a pair of decent speakers.Conclusion:All in all, this is easily the best TV we've owned so far.  It makes our Samsung look like it was built by amateurs, and gives our previous Sony LCD TV a run for the money.  Vizio's comparable offering comes close, but the image processing options on this LG put it over the top.", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Much Better Than I Expected", "Author": "N.

I had frustrating experiences with both TVs regarding the loss of synchronization between the active-shutter glasses and the TV.  To bad, as they had fantastic 2D pictures.I then purchased this LG 3D TV, because the passive 3D glasses are simple, with no synchronization issues.  However I saw reports that said the picture was not as good, but anything is better that having glasses that keep going blurry.Well, to my surprise, this TV has the BEST 3D picture of all of them.  I was expecting to have to compromise for lighter, simpler glasses.  No way!  This 3D picture is very clear and bright.  And Full HD too.  The reviews I saw used a test disk to prove this set has lower than HD picture in 3D mode, but those disks are created assuming traditional line-scan technology.  Well, LG does not use traditional line-scanning to make this passive 3D picture, and maybe the tests don't represent this new method that well.  Well, that must be the case, because this picture is (if anything) better than the Samsung's 3D output.  It handles fast motion much better (less blur), and my eyes don't get as tired.I am VERY pleased to find I didn't need to compromise ANYTHING to go to passive 3D technology.  LG has made a great TV and I would recommend it to anyone.  This sounds like I'm being paid for this.  No Way.  I'm just that surprised that passive glasses can be so good!", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R16NLJBIHBH4O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So after 15 years of watching our 27 inch Magnavox box, I decided to leap into the 21st century and buy a new flat panel TV. And as long as I was buying a new TV, I might as well get the latest technology. I spent hours on-line researching all the brands available and learning the difference between Plasma vs LCD and Interactive 3D vs Passive 3D. I also went to all the stores and looked at the screens from all the TV's hanging on the walls. Finally, I read all the reviews from all the different websites on all the various TV's. Man, now I was totally confused and had no idea which TV to buy.I looked at what made sense for me and my family and decided that the most important feature I needed was a 3D picture that all 5 members of my family could sit around and watch without taking a mortgage out on the glasses. I went with the 55LW5600 passive 3D.Wow ! I made a great choice.The 3D picture is fantastic. It is so clear and looks so alive. I bought a 3D Blu Ray player also, so I don't know if that makes a difference, but we are so awe struck by the 3D that my family has demanded that I go out and buy more 3D movies. I went out and bought another 2 set of glasses for $24 and now friends can join in the fun. The 3D experience has become a hit.The 2D to 3D format is pretty cool. It's not quite 3D, but it does add depth. My wife watched Dancing with the Stars in this mode and loved it and I watched a hockey game and it was great.We have HD channels on our cable system and that picture is also amazing. Again, very clear and sharp. I don't watch the digital channels anymore unless I have to.Set up was easy. The system recocnized the Blu Ray and the internet. Pretty much, plug it in and go. we have Netflix, which works great, but I haven't spent a lot of time on the other Aps yet. I also have not tried any video games on this TV. Also, we sit about 10 feet from the TV and am glad we bought the 55 inch.Overall, for the average TV watcher like myself, great TV.  To get passive 3D and all the functions found on all other TV's, for the price, the 55LW5600 is the way to go.", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Our First HD TV", "Author": "Paul Cassel", "ReviewID": "R3T73R8I5RMUPE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Unlike almost everybody else, this is our first HD TV. We vacillated between wanting this technology and thinking it's rather silly because we don't watch that much TV nor do we view many DVD's. Still, after a bit, we decided that it's time for us to move into the current millennium, ditch our 24\" tube TV and move forward into the land of HD 3D TV.We are glad we did. This set has exceeded our expectations on every level. Well, perhaps that was easy to do as we had little expectations or should I say, we didn't know what to expect. First, I'll discuss our experience transporting and setting the TV up.My thought upon getting my hands on the TV in the box was that it was an inflatable TV. It seemed a certain size in the store, but it expanded somewhat mysteriously when we had to put it in the truck. Somehow it pretty much filled the bed of our compact pickup truck with an 8 foot / 2.4 meter bed. Then the TV expanded yet again when we got it into our den. Let's say we don't regret at all not getting a 60\" TV. Our viewing distance is 11 feet / 3.3 meters from the TV. This set's size is certainly large enough for that distance and, I suspect, a good deal further.Setup, our greatest fear, was trivial. In fact, there was no setup to speak of. The only item which had any element of effort was configuring the WiFi and again, the TV sensed that (we got the WiFi adapter as part of the package) instantly. My only problem was entering the 128 bit encryption which took me a bit of time until I figure out how to switch the remote control from alpha to numeric output (and back).We plugged in two HDMI and one component for our sources. To my surprise, the TV sensed input from a signaling device and switched its port to that device. If two devices are both signaling, the TV will ask which you wish to use. There are two setup screens. The first is the quick screen useful for accessing the most often needed adjustments. The other is the complete setup screen where you can fiddle to your heart's delight tweaking the various elements of the HD experience. Since I'm slightly deaf from years of motorcycle riding, I changed the sound setting to some sort of hard of hearing enhancement and am happy to report that it works wonderfully. I now can watch and clearly hear speech at volume levels my wife says are comfortable for her too. That has been impossible on any device before. I wish I could give 6 stars for the sound quality.The TV picture is amazing in all respects. There is no bleeding, no flashlighting and no buzzing or other annoyances. It's just ideal. Given a quality input such as a Blu-ray DVD or an HD cable 'cast, the picture will range from beyond expectations to stunning. We watched an HD cable 'cast of something about Star Wars and the Stiths (#3 or #6 of the Star Wars series of movies depending on how one counts) and we could hardly believe the utter perfection of the picture. In fact, we were to immersed in the look that today I can't tell you what a Stith is or why it's making a war on a star.We tried the 3D from a Blu-ray source. The effect is, we thought, better than in a theater. Unlike some here claim, we saw no degradation in the passive vs. the active 3D glasses. We experienced no headaches or dizziness from the 3D. We found the 3D experience to be a benefit rather than just a gimmick. I ordered a Blu-ray DVD of Avatar in 3D. We can't wait.I can't rate this compared to other HD TV's I've owned because, as said earlier, this is our first. I can wholeheartedly and without reservation recommend this set to anybody with a special call out to newbies who may be worried about complex setups or other issues. The TV seems setup in the box with the WiFi the only item which took a bit of effort.", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "3D is effective, but TV is otherwise average", "Author": "P", "ReviewID": "R3AQUO8YGTM1JH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "UPDATE: Our TV lasted about 21 months, but now it has stopped functioning and is out of warranty. If you're into getting extended warranties, then you might like this TV, but if like me you think such products should be built to last a bit longer that this, then keep looking.-----------------------The passive 3D is a good effect, easy to adjust to and convenient to watch. The loss of resolution due to the interlacing is noticeable but tolerable. Supplied glasses are lightweight but flimsy, however they are inexpensive to replace.The frame interpolation 'TruMotion' is somewhat unnatural, and we soon deactivated it. SmartTV apps are ok, but don't expect the kind of quality interface you'd get from an AppleTV.However the worst aspect of the television is the severe bleeding through of the backlight. Screens of blackness have large clouds of light all around, particularly in the top left corner. This light leakage is so bad that we are presently considering returning this television.Overall, the pleasant 3D doesn't disguise the fact that the rest of the TV functions are just average.", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Gamers review.", "Author": "Art", "ReviewID": "R28WM8L1MHL3BC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are already plenty of reviews saying that the screen quality is superb. I will confirm that this is true. Especially if you get your settings right. Go to either CNET tv settings or the AVS forumn for great calibration settings.This is a great tv especially for watching tv during the day in brighter rooms as it has a matte screen finish.GAMERS! This TV does have some lag. It might not be noticeable to you as it is lower then some other TVs i have played on. It is very minor and unless you are either really sensitive to lag or you are en elite gamer i would still consider this TV. It really is great. Sometimes i notice it more then other times. My setup is an Xbox 360 connected with HDMI, main game is Halo reach. The key to having low lag is relabeling your xbox 360 hdmi connection to \"PC\". hit [input] on the remote, then [green]. Change it so it's name \"PC\". Renaming to the input to \"PC\" is suppose to disable all the extra XD processing that runs in the background. Don't forget to hit [AVmode] and select GAME too. This was KEY to having low lag. The tv had terrible lag in game mode and even more terrible lag when it was not in game mode. But for some reason when you relabel it to PC it magically disappears.Sound is just average for a tv but get a sound system if this bugs you.Interface isn't the best and isn't the worst i have seen. Magic wand is sorta a joke. It makes some things easier to deal with and some things not.UPDATE (Aug 23, 2011): For those of you that are hard core gamers and want as little lag as possible. Using a VGA connection from your Xbox to this TV brings down the lag to almost non existent.

I really wanted a great 2D picture, but pretty much all the top tvs these days have 3D built in. I debated whether or not to go for active vs. passive - even after comparing the 2 in the store. Eventually, I narrowed it down to a Sony EX720, a Samsung D7000 or the LG LW5600. I almost pulled the trigger on the Samsung because of the picture quality, although it was more expensive and needs glasses. But I found a great deal on this set that was too good to pass up. Now here's where the 5 stars part of my review comes in...I found a better price for this set than Amazon was selling it for at the time, and so I called in and Amazon agreed to price match and to still give me free shipping even though the price matched site charged shipping! I am an Amazon Prime member, and really wanted to get it on Amazon anyways....so I took it up.I got the set 2 days later, and I am ecstatic that I got this set! The picture quality and local dimming are great, although you really do need to change some default settings right out of the box (Real Cinema sucks and makes everything look like a soap opera). Again, I didn't get this TV for 3D content, but I gave it a shot on some of the Direct TV 3D channels and it looked great! And, surprisingly, it converted 2D->3D really well (although it worked a lot better for animated stuff). I got 8 pairs of glasses with the set, so I think I'm set for life from that front. I still don't know that I'll use the 3D all the time, but it does look great on this set. I read around that people complain about the decreased quality of passive 3D, but it really does look great on this set and I can't see any lines or ghosting at all.With all of the features and quality of this tv, the fact that it includes the wifi dongle and the glasses, and the comparatively moderate price, I think it's one of the best 3DTVs out there.

It stopped working March 5, 2012 (that's 3 months, if  you're counting).One night it worked fine, by the next morning we could get sound, but no picture.  A quick Google search on 'LG TV Sound, No Picture' revealed this is a known problem with LG sets.  How well known?  There is a class-action lawsuit against the company in New Jersey.I want to say LG's customer service has been great.  I really, really want to say that. Unfortunately, I cannot.  After an hour on the phone with customer service, I was referred to a local TV repair company.  They told me that they cannot come out to fix the set at the LG-scheduled time because they did not have parts.  So there was a little miscommunication between LG and local TV repair company, no big deal, right?Maybe.Because if you go to Consumer Reports, you'll see not 1, not 2, not 10 pages of similar problems (and a similar parts back log) but 44 pages of LG problems, many of which are this 'sound, no picture' issue.  It appears, and I admit this is conjecture on my part and the part of hundreds of other consumers who have had this issue, that this is a such a widespread problem there is a parts backlog.  Apparently the part is called a 'capacitor.'  See the website, badcaps.net for more details.My ardent hope is this issue will be fixed in no time flat and I will back here singing LG's praises.  That's my hope.  I'll keep updating this review as the situation evolves.  But as of now, my advice is to stay far, far away from LG TVs.  Spend an extra $100 and go with another brand.  After all, just a simple Google search will tell you we're not the only people who've been nailed by this.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great picture, loads of features--calibrate the picture first", "Author": "J. Smith", "ReviewID": "ROOK27LE3SHKN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for about three weeks, and have been very satisfied with my first LG product.  I looked at quite a few TV's, but finally settled on this LG model as it seemed to offer the best picture and a large number of features that should prevent it from becoming obsolete too quickly.After first setting it up and trying out a BluRay disc, I was amazed at the picture quality--much better than my previous 3 year old Westinghouse LCD HDTV. The picture while watching regular cable TV, however, was disappointing at first. There are five preset modes you can choose from: standard mode that is the default right out of the box, cinema, game, etc. I tried all of them but was not really satisfied.  I noticed that there are two additional \"expert\" modes with complicated values in the setup screen that I didn't understand at first.I checked CNET.com and found detailed instructions for calibrating this TV using the \"expert\" modes. After printing out the directions and changing the values in the expert mode according to CNET's recommendation, the quality of the picture while watching cable TV went from good to fantastic, and normal DVDs and BluRay discs are also superb. I strongly recommend that you calibrate this TV's picture using the directions on CNET to bring out the best in this set. The colors are the best I've seen--incredibly life like.Turns out there are 2 \"expert modes\"--you could set one for all around viewing (which I did using the CNET directions), and use the other to dial in some other viewing experience (CNET has a recommendation for a second set of values as well).  With the two expert modes and the five preset modes, you have a total of 7 choices -- you will undoubtedly find one that satisfies your needs.I bought a 3D movie and was pleasantly surprised at the experience.  Four of us watched \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" and everyone enjoyed the 3D movie.  That movie's 3D experience was more like watching 3D \"within\" the screen as opposed to having images project into the room.  I imagine that the \"projection\" style 3D experience has more to do with the disc than the television--I did see a demo with this unit where undersea creatures seemed to be floating outside the screen in the room.  If you want to watch a 3D movie, you'll also have to buy a 3D BluRay player.You can also convert normal 2D TV shows to 3D.  That feature works ok, but is not the same full experience as a 3D BluRay disc.  I doubt if I'll ever use the 2D to 3D feature (you have to put on the 3D glasses for that feature just like watching 3D movies).  There are really only a handful of 3D movies for sale right now (mostly cartoons and sci-fi type movies)-- and they are about twice the price of a normal DVD, but that should all change as more 3D sets are sold.The wireless internet feature works perfectly and was simple to set up--updates to the TV are installed automatically via wireless as well.  You plug in a small wireless receiver which comes with the set into one of the USB ports on the rear of the set when you first set it up to get the wireless features to work.The auto volume system that lowers the volume of commercials during TV shows is wonderful--no more fumbling with a remote to lower the volume while people are screaming at you to buy something. (If you like really loud commercials, you can turn off the auto sound feature.)The LG apps left me wanting more.  I downloaded a few to the set (I think you can store about 250 megs of apps onboard), but most are children's games or other things that I doubt I would ever use--a computer will allow you to do much more than the LG apps. (The weather app, for example, only lists major cities, so my town is not listed--the closest weather info is for a city 250 miles away). LG does seem to be adding apps to their library regularly, so you may find some you like.  I don't subscribe to Netflix or HuluPlus, but those apps would be helpful if you are a subscriber.You can also easily access your computer from this TV.  Once you synchronize the TV with your computer you can wirelessly view picture and video and sound files, but you do need to designate ahead of time which files you might want to view on your TV--a very nice feature if you want to watch a slide show with pictures on your computer.  I tried a short slide show and it worked well.  I also tried hooking up a laptop to the computer--worked perfectly and you could also watch a slide show or surf the net or whatever using the TV as your computer monitor.The set comes with two remotes--a fully featured infrared remote you point at the TV and operate in the normal manner by clicking your way through various options, and a smaller, sleek radio frequency remote that you don't have to aim at the TV to control volume and channels.  The smaller remote controls basic options such as volume and channel changes--it also has a button for the Home Screen where you access all the TV's special features.....this button also activates an onscreen icon that you can use by  pointing it at various screen options on the home page to make changes to setup or inputs, choose apps, play games, and other things. This system is much faster than using the full size remote.  You will want to aim the remote at the screen while using this feature to point the icon around the screen at the things you want to control.Since my old AV receiver finally gave up the ghost, I am currently using the TV's built in speakers and find them to be fine for most of my purposes.  Obviously, the TV's speakers are nothing like my old surround sound system, but I don't have any complaints--dialogue is easy to understand, and music is ok as well.  You can control treble, bass, etc. to your liking. Eventually, I'll probably get a sound bar with a subwoofer, but don't feel the need to rush out and upgrade the sound on the TV to cure a glaring defect.There seem to be plenty of spaces in the back of the TV for attaching various components--at the moment, however, I only have a DVD player attached to this set and a monitor cable for those times when I want to connect a laptop as well.I'm sure there are other features I'll find that I'm not currently using as I play with this TV more, and assuming this LG proves to be reliable, I think I'll be happy with this unit for quite a few years.

Simply put, this LG TV had exceeded all my expectations so far, and it didn't disappoint me in any way.It is light, thin, bright (LED), crystal-clear HD pictures, good non-HD pictures as well, affordable price tag (under $1,400 as of Nov. 2011), and top price/performance ratio (good value) in my opinion. But above all, the most pleasant surprise is the SmartTV, which i actually didn't care much about it before the purchase, but only realized it more how it adds more value and convenience in today's world where you have almost constant, instant access to the zillions of contents on the Internet thru your smartphones, tablets and those iGears. Although the SmartTV features (such as web browser, AppStore, contents available) are still in its early days as compared to others like Apple's AppStore, its built-in wireless and wired network connections provide a fundamental infrastructure connecting a TV to the Internet. Think about it for a moment! You could update software/firmware on the TV. You could connect to Netflix & Youtube among many others, and access to contents provided in the \"LG store\", many of which are free of charge. As more contents available, i think one day I could cut my cable subscriptions. Last not least, this is a 3D TV. I had seen it in store demo and it looked good. I liked the passive 3D technology as the glasses are lighter, easy to use, and way less expensive than active 3D glasses. In fact, 4 pairs of 3D glasses were included in the package.In summary, over about a month I did my research and compared several brands,sizes,and models (including Sharp, Samsung, Sony, Vizio, etc.), before choosing this LG, 55\", LED, 3D, Smart TV.  It turned out that 3D and SmartTV are the two most important new features that would keep this TV looking decent in 3-5 years at least. The rest of the other features are becoming commodity and don't matter much among brands, and typical human eyes probably cannot tell the subtle differences anyway.", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic 3D HDTV", "Author": "Norman Steere", "ReviewID": "R105U5445W0UJK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this LG 55LW5600 3D 120Hz TV for several weeks now. My familly and all our friends and familly and have been very impressed with it especially with the Blue ray 3D movies.Choosing between a passive 3D and and an active 3D TV was a no brainer after seeing both in action at the same store. I have heard that passive 3D cuts the resolution in half. If that's true it was impossible for me to tell the difference between it and the Active 3D resolution. To me passive had a much better look and feel to it and you don't deal with VERY expensive bulky battery powered glasses, and the viewing angle for passive was really good. I could not evaluate viewing angle on the active 3d because they had the glasses fixed to a viewing stand on the floor. I'm guessing they were worried about the glasses being stolen or damaged because they are not cheap! Also (I don't know if there is any truth to this) but a sales rep told me that Active 3D was limited to a certain number of viewers, meaning that if you had a bunch of people over to watch a 3D movie only a few of them would be able to watch because the signal transmitted from the TV was limited to only (I think he said) 4 pairs of glasses. Check into this if you decide to go with an Active 3D TV.The only draw back I had with this TV and it is a well known problem with many LED HDTVs and that is the input lag during gaming. When gaming the controllers whether it be a joystick, mouse, game pads or TrackIR, all of these had what seemed to be a 1/2 second delay from the time a button is pressed or joystick or mouse moved to the time it actually happened on screen. I found it to make playing games impossible even when the TV setting was set to gaming mode. However I read in another forum that one way to getting around that problem was to plug the PC into the VGA connection on the TV instead of the HDMI connection. (Using the VGA bypasses the TV processor which is what causes the lag) I have a high end graphics card in my PC with both HDMI and DVI ports and simply used a DVI to VGA cable and pooof! no more lag and the graphics were as good as they looked on a high end PC monitor. Just keep in mind that if you use the VGA connection that you will need to use a separate audio source from the PC to the TV or to an amplifier or use your desktop speakers for sound because VGA connections do not carry the audio signal like HDMI does. For mine I used an Optical audio cable from the PC to my surround sound receiver.So far I am very impressed and pleased with the picture quality right out of the box with no calibration. Also there has been talk of needing a 1.4 HDMI cable to view Blue Ray 3D movies. I and many others have found this to be completely false. A current standard HDMI cable works perfect so don't let the salesman talk you into buying a $120.00 HDMI cable.Also make sure that the store you buy from will price match, meaning if another store locally is selling the exact same tv at a lower price they will match it. The salesman I dealt with went so far as to do the price matching for me on the spot on the internet and found that Best Buy was selling the same TV for less and offered me that price plus 10% off of that price and threw in an additonal 6 pairs of glasses and also will give me a refund for the differance in price if I find a lower price than what I paid for it within 45 days after the purchase.", "Date": "July 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Value", "Author": "Amcd", "ReviewID": "R1553RKBVCOHLK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We're value consumers.

Got it with 36 months free financing. Can't beat that.Brought it home and out of the box it looked great. Looked up some videophile sites and tweaked a couple of settings. Video is great. 4 HDMI inputs. 2D to 3D conversion is pretty cool. Although what that gives you is depth of picture. Don't expect objects to come out of the screen. We don't have a Blue Ray player but I did invite my mom over who I helped purchase a new laptop which just happened to have a Blue Ray drive. Watched \"How to train your Dragon\" BD disk. You can definitely tell the difference in video quality over our 720P Panasonic plasma TV upstairs. Set up DNLA server to pull content from our laptop. Worked like a charm.

Amazon, I can't create a review unless I've ordered something recently? Really? I come here to get opinions from other consumers.

I have read countless reviews on it, most great some not so good.A few days ago someone else mentioned all the ghosting when watching sports and that scared me a lot, since it is mostly what I watch. After installing the TV and calibrating it I must say that I am extremely satisfied with this purchase. I watched 3 hours of soccer two days ago in HD and it was superb, no ghosting at all. Then last night watched a college football game on ESPN HD and it looks amazing again, without any ghosting or blur.I have played BF3 on it also and all I can say is WOW.

I originally wanted the equivalent Samsung TV, but this TV came with the internet dongle, 6 extra pairs of 3D glasses (from Best Buy) in addition to the 4 free ones, and it's 3D.  The samsung costs hundreds more for the same specs and more for the extras.  Now I'm not a crazy videophile but I'm very pleased with this tv.  The picture quality is excellent.  I don't notice the LED edge lighting issues in the corners like I've read on some reviews.  The features are very easy to program and the different picture modes are easy to select.  This model is also very easy to calibrate and I did that by google-ing it.  The 3D is ok.  It's not as good as the active glasses but it's way cheaper so I sacrificed a touch in 3D quality for a few hundred dollars.  If 3D is really important to you go with the Samsung.  The sound is adequate.  It was better than I expected given the reviews I read but I feed it out to my receiver anyways so it doesn't matter.  I do notice a bit of voice lag or voice mismatch, but I've read that's really a Verizon FiOS issue more than it is an LG issue.  The tru-motion is the only thing that is a complete bust.  It pixelates everything and when I searched for the different calibrations, every expert just said to turn it off so if you're buying the TV because you're interested in the tru-motion, don't do it.  The 120hz is enough for all the pro sports games I've watched so far.  I like the internet and ap features especially when using the remote.  I tried out the Samsung remote and it just didn't work easily for me.  It's true that the TV doesn't have Flash 10 so it has limited web content, but I expect there to be a firmware update in the near future to alleviate that.

You will not notice it unless you're hunting for flaws. Anyone who says differently is just being a negative nancy. The 2D picture is amazingly crisp and clear. I compared this tv to Toshiba's 55 inch 3dtv which boasts 240mHz. Lg's 120mHz tv blows it away in picture quality and 3d depth. I only have two complaints: 1st, the stand is very flimsy and unstable. If you or your kids run through the house YOUR TV WILL SHAKE. I highly recommend mounting this one to a wall. 2nd, sometimes (only sometimes) when using the 2D to 3D conversion the picure and sound can be out of sync by half a second.

It was delivered 4 days earlier than expected. As always, you can't go wrong by shopping at Amazon. When I first unpacked LG Infinia LW5600, I was so pleased at the aesthetics. I hadn't actually seen one in person and was amazed at how sleek looking the front was, and how incredibly thin this television is. It's amazingly about 1\" thick. It has a nice swivel base, which I love. At this point I wasn't going to mount it on the wall, but given it's incredibly thin profile, I would some day; it would look awesome on a wall. It was easy to mount on the base, and the television is light enough, a strong enough person could do it without help. I didn't have any problem. I turned it on went through the easy to follow initial setup. Easy Easy Easy to set up, and connect to a home network via WIFI.This set has more bells and whistles than you'll ever need, some being really cool. It has the standard stuff like Netflix, Pandora, Youtube, and even Facebook. It also has a web browser that allows you to brows the web just like you would on your computer. Pretty cool on a 55\" HD screen. The web browser even has some nice tools such as Favorites. There are Apps, just like you would find on a smart phone; some free and some for purchase. The \"magic wand\" remote is pretty cool, with it's Wii like function of just point at the TV, move the cursor over an item, and click. In other words, when you hear the term \"feature rich\" this TV certainly is.The passive 3D is pretty cool, although I don't have a 3D blue ray movie in my collection yet. The 2D to 3D conversion is surprisingly pretty cool and pretty well done. With the conversion feature, you won't get things popping out of the screen, but it does add depth to the picture, sort of like watching real life through a 55\" window. The glasses are very comfortable, to the point I forgot I had them on. You can walk around the house with them on and they do not hinder your vision. However, I did notice, with the passive 3D, you can't get to far off center from the picture because you'll get a lot of crosstalk. I did view some true 3D content in the apps section, which did have things popping right out of the screen. I was impressed with the 3D.The BadFirst let me say, I'm crushed this TV didn't live up to what is could be. I wanted to keep it so badly, mostly because if it's awesome features, and the sleek look. Then I started actually watching television. It was all uphill from there. Let's just point out the very poor sound quality form the speakers. I expected that. You can't expect theatre sound from a TV that's an inch thick, or any other flat screen TV for that matter. I also noticed, very distinctly, what some are calling the \"Soap Opera Effect\". It makes the picture, no matter what the source, BluRay, Cable, Netflix, etc... look like it was filmed on a home video camera. It's very odd and hard to explain, but it's like watching a low budget public access show that can't afford the really expensive professional video cameras and lighting they use to make Hollywood movies. Grab your video camera, go out in your back yard, and film your family, then watch it on your TV. That's what all programming looks like on the TV; even Avatar looked like it was filmed informally with a cheap camera, even though in HD. To be honest, at times, it was pretty interesting to see things in that perspective, but mostly it gets annoying because you never see anything as it was intended by the director. In other words, it's a huge drawback, but not the biggest.The biggest drawback is the different aspects of the horrible picture quality. First, let me explain, this ain't my first rodeo. I've owned plasma and LCD TVs, ranging from 40\" to 50\". So setting up a good picture is something I'm quite familiar with. I spent three days tweaking the settings in this TV, trying to get the colors, brightness, etc... where I like it. It seemed to get one thing right, I had to sacrifice another. Finally I just settled by saying it's not the best, but I could probably live with it, although it still ticked me off. Of the poor picture quality issues, this wasn't the worst. The worst and complete deal breaker was the incredible amount of motion blur and shuttering you get from this set. It's horribly intolerable, even to the point of causing horrible eye strain. This is in regular 2D mode, mind you. The \"True Motion\" feature is useless. In fact even LG Support suggests you turn it off. After the first couple of days of trying to get rid of the juddering effect, I called LG customer support and got a tech on the line. He said I'd have to switch the AV mode to GAME mode. This helped some, but only some. The motion blur and juddering were still intolerable, and what you gained by using GAME mode, you lost by adding a ghosting effect around any moving objects on the screen. The LG tech said, and I quote, \"if that didn't fix it, that's just how the picture is then.\" Anyway, what's the point of having different \"Modes\" if you can only use GAME Mode? Didn't matter anyway, it still didn't solve the problem.In the end, the TV is sitting in my guest bedroom now, all packed up, and waiting for the shipping company to pick it back up to return it to Amazon. I went to Walmart yesterday and purchased a 60\" Panasonic 2D Plasma they have on sale for $898 This set was awesome right out of the box as soon as I turned it on. I spent less than 10 minutes tweaking the picture settings and I'm done. It's awesome every time now. I really wanted to love the LG set, but unfortunately there's no getting around the fact that you purchase a television to enjoy watching it, and this set did nothing but frustrate and annoy me. I wouldn't recommend it. You still can't beat a plasma TV for picture quality.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "A 3D impression review", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1GJKRKOULCCEQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm really here to talk about the 3D picture.  I've had my TV for only 2 weeks and if something changes over time I will update this review.  This is my first ever review about a product but it has been such a great experience I had had had to share.Con:1. Out of the box 3D picture quality isn't the greatest but with just 10-20  minutes of configuration it's (for the lack of a better word) AMAZING.  If 10-20  minutes is way to much time for you...  Oh never mind...Pros:1. 3D Movies (using PS3) are fantastic (colors are bright and image is actually  clearer than watching a movie in 2D).2. 3D gaming (PS3) is mesmerizing.  I have not tried using my 360 for gaming yet.3. 2D -> 3D gaming brings new life to video games you've already finished and also  makes games you haven't played a really great experience.4. 2D -> 3D movies/tv series (blu-ray) and tv shows (cable) sometimes works great  and other times doesn't add much.5. Customization of 3D depth etc.The Review:In some online (professional sites) reviews as a con they say that the 3D picture is soft compared to active.  IMO and friends of mine this is soooo not true.  I have both Passive and Active Tv's (Active TV is top quality Samsung UN55D8000) and I'm sorry but Passive does not lose ANYTHING in terms of 3D color, image, depth and it sure isn't \"soft\".The whole HD diminishment of quality is a crock (with one exception so far.  See 3D gaming).  Sure, if you are using some high tech gear that can detect the difference or sitting 1 foot in front of the tv (who does this anyways) but my eyes and 30 + of my friends can't see it.  Yes.  30 + of my friends see no difference (not one) and actually prefer to wear the Passive glasses.Movies in 3D:  Watch REAL 3D movies like Tangled, Legends of the Guardian, IMAX Hubble side by side with an Active and Passive tv and you will see NO difference besides the fact that your eyes don't hurt, no ghosting etc. on Passive (I'm about 6 feet away from my TV).3D gaming:  Killzone 3 - The exception in quality was this game which seemed pixilated compared to the 2D version.  Don't get me wrong, it was still really fun to play and look at but just not as crisp as other games.God of War Origins Collection - What great depth it provided.  It was like playing a new game running down corridors and all.Wipeout - The depth and color was perfect.Motorstorm - Great depth and things flying out at you.Super Stardust HD - The colors are vibrant and when you die the explosion made my son and his friend duck and say \"Whoooa!!\".  It was pretty funny.2D -> 3D gaming:  I've played Batman: Arkham Asylum, Infamous 2 and God of War 3.  I'm not going to go into detail about each one but I will say this.  ALL of them worked being converted and something interesting happened as well.  The 3D brought out a more crisp color to each of the games.  What a great feeling it was playing these games in 3D. It was like I was playing a whole new game even though I've spent many many hours playing them in the past.  I can not wait to play on my 360 and play games like Dead Space.2D -> 3D movies/tv series (bluray):  There were a couple of movies that looked really good in the conversion (Green Hornet, Avatar, and How to Train Your Dragon).  Others (color wise) looked good but the 3D was less effective (Battlestar Galactica (new series) and Transformers 1.2D -> 3D tv (Comcast):  I've only done a couple football games (1 NCAA and 1 NFL) and a hockey game and they were alright.  Not the best but the 3D still worked and again the colors were sharper.3D customization:  There are many blogs out there that tell you how to set up the TV.  Each one is different for the type of room layout (size, brightness, darkness).  No matter which one you choose it doesn't take long to really make your TV look fantastic.  You can also adjust the depth of the 3D image which is really impressive.I'm not an Active hater (I do own both) and I still love my Active TV but if you want a great TV get a Passive TV for hundreds if not thousands of dollars cheaper and you will not be disappointed.PS.  At 120hz even with the fastest motions on screen do not blur.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "A wonderful tv, for a reasonable price.(Update:Jan 29 2012)", "Author": "Loriann Moreno \"Optimist\"", "ReviewID": "R3RSPE3TRYEV6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "To be honest i am a new person to the smart tv's and the new school HD TV's(last tv i had was a Trinitron Sony rear projection tv of 2004#. I was deciding to get Sony, but i went in to the 4 free glasses and a LG LED/LCD 3d tv. After a week I am really glad i passed up Sony to get an LG, i baught this at Costco for about a thousand dollars while Sony's was a hundred or two hundred more. For me it was the fact that Sony was too expensive, it needed a WIFI dongle that was sold seperately and there was a slight difference in picture quality, nothing drastic in terms of quality in comparison to this product. I will begin to review what is inside the box and what you can expect in terms of 3D,Graphics aka picture quality,Video Games, Apps and the built in internet.Inside the box-You will get 4 free 3D passive glasses#AG-F200# in two small boxes, meaning that it is like ordinary sun glasses but instead of having batteries to put in, it just works as you are watching the 3D, no on and off switch needed just watch it through the shades and enjoy. Plus when i looked at the prices on Amazon, i believe they were 20$ dollars or 10$ per each pair of 3D glasses.The stand itself is auctully really well made and it has two different ways to put the TV on, but most likely everyone will be using the normal style of putting the tv into place and just using a basic Philips screwdriver to put those screws into place.A WIFI dongle that comes with the tv meaning that once you put the WIFI dongle in the USB port, all you need is WIFI and you're tv will update to the newest patch available and you are all set to go. Also i would like to add if you have a laptop that is wireless you can share music and put it wirelessly to you're tv thanks to the dongle.The Remote- it is vary solid and i like the looks of it, it has small details and pictures printed on the controls that would not make sense to a new user. For example the connections and settings are on top, along with the numbers, in the middle is the volume button on the left, channel on the right, favorite button,mute and 3d in the middle, it goes on and on it is vary simple for me to use.There is no HDMI but the basic AV connector i am highly dissapointed in that. I highly suggest that LG next year on forward they try to include an HDMI cable because i do not see the point anymore for an AV connector when everyone knows HDMI cables enhance the tv's resolution and auctully shows the 1080p and 720p in the fullest and purest detail available.Everyone needs buy an HDMI Mediabridge Ultra Series - High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet - #6 Feet# - Category 2 Certified - Supports 3D & Audio Return Channel [Latest HDMI Version Available] it is 10$ but it is worth it to get the most out of you're television and viewing experience.Graphics and Presentation-While i will admit the presentation might not be the greatest and certainly not the worst on the menu of a tv screen. But i will concede that it is vary simple to use and really helps new users like me navigate through the screen, i just think it could be a little bit more polished.As for the picture quality i am absolutely floored, the levels of colors are just really unimaginable in the sense that it feels like a theater, i have watched a few shows and truly instead of scenes feeling like the camera has turned to black one moment and then turns back on, the tv auctully makes it move at 120HZ. Meaning that instead of seeing motion blur#Example a speedy pass by a quarterback on television and a WR catching the ball for a TD, or a movie where the scene fades to black for too long#, it speeds it up a little bit making smart decisions on keeping the flow of what a person is watching, move naturally instead of feeling contrived. The higher the Hz the better decisions can be made on the tv's end of processing what is seen on the screen no matter how fast it is and nothing feels slowed down or choppy.There are also 5 different modes plus two expert modes if you do not like the standard mode at allIntelligent sensor- I like this a lot, it helps if you have a well lit room, i highly suggest this, as it scans you're room and adjusts accordingly to the room and it's lights.Cinema-This is interesting, because it dims down and it really feels like a movie experience at the local imax theatres except you do not have to pay a thing, but enjoy the movie like mode as much as you please.Vivid-I suggest this only if you are wanting to make the room a little bit more brighter, that is all this mode does clear and simple.Game-I highly suggest this one if you are playing video games, because it turns off most of the image processing power to reduce the lag on a console or computer.Internet and Apps-On Youtube-LG did a bad job with the youtube browser in general. Sadly it is not to fast, and i wish it would allow a wireless keyboard to type in the search bar quicker, and an update to make the internet a tiny bit faster. Most of the time i am stuck tapping my remote up and down and it takes 4 seconds to move up or down to a word or a number and it just really needs to be looked into and improved a lot more. I think LG should let you login to you're own youtube account and have some way they can integrate it to were it is a seamless transition.The good news i will say on LG is that the graphics look a lot crisper with the tv than they do with my PS3 going on youtube. It really shows if LG could really work on this, they can really become nothing short of amazing. LG to me is on it's way especially with the internet browser, it is not bad at all either, but there is room for improvement.As for the apps they are nothing really special right now, i think it is to cluttered and it needs to be cleaned up in favor of a few and more efficient applications in which LG can update every 3 months to make the apps better and better. Who knows maybe LG can try to have a few classic RPG games or Sim City one day.3D and Video Games-WARNING- I have to strongly warn parents etc if you have a child under 6 years old, do not let you're children watch 3D, they are in the devolpmental stage of their sight,hearing etc and it might send wrong signals to a childs left and right eye quicker than they can handle. This applies to all 3D technology as of now in 2011. Also i would advise parents and children who do watch 3D to try to take a 20minute break if you feel uncomfortable or atleast a 15minute break after each hour to rest you're eyes and to not cause eye strain for a few days.I put these two together because i really play a ton on my PS3 and it really has been noticably weird. Also to note i have a few games i have tried in 3D and especially youtube videos. It is not like everyone thinks it is, where something is sopposed to pop out at you and you are to be frightened. To be honest i think 3D has completely changed in the 21st century and it shows with this TV.I was a little bit concerned buying this tv, thinking 3D is a gimmick, but let me clarify something especially with the games i played#i have yet to watch a movie in 3D but i am sure people who have will agree with me on this#, is that when i put on my 3D glasses on for a game like Killzone 3, there is not a cheap effect or a knockoff back in the old days. I feel more immersed and apart of that world with the snow coming towards me etc, and the graphics in 3D are in high definition#not in some oldschool standard) and as are the characters that you interact with, which really creates a unbelievable combination.For all the good news about 3D there is also bad sadly, i think 3D is on it's way but right now we might have to wait awhile for more games,movies etc to start supporting this feature, but overall LG has nailed the right balance in the 3D department along with an immersive experience for the common movie goer and gamer alike.Overall opinion-To me it has been a longtime since i have baught a brand new tv, and the wait was well worth it. Also who can argue the savings and efficiency this tv brings, from what i read at my local costco store it can save 70$ to 40$ a month, my collosal tv i previously owned could not say that really. I believe if you are looking for a fantastic tv with a balance of quality.conveinence and with some new features with 3D but can not afford more than 1,200$ i urge you to take the plunge and get it. You will not regret it, because i know i do not. I hope i helped a lot of people out there make the right choice.-----------------------------------------Jan 29th 2012.So far i came back to report after nearly 3 months, i have had zero problems with my LGLW5600 it took a month to start burning in and to keep up with my games,movies etc. Also i am happy to report there is no dead pixels, start up problems or anything of that nature. the 47 inch may look a little bit small to those with a wide area, but it still fits the bill. It still looks as crisp as when i bought it if not better. For those who are wondering if they should get a 47 inch version or a 55, i would go with the 47 inch, for now the technology is not there verify a purchase on these types of televisions to leave you stunned or awestruck especially with the 3D just starting to be implemented. The graphics look excellent on the 47 inch model, even in high definition with fine textures in video games or contrast with photos, movies etc. I would highly advise anybody to still purchase from LG.

I'm not even sure whether they still ship this particular model but I was sitting here enjoying the set and thought I'd better pass on my congratulations to LG for a really great range of 3D TV's. To preface my comments I should say that I own a 3D company that works on 3D blockbuster movies so i) I'm invested in 3D ii) I'm pretty damn fussy when it comes to my TV and 3D in particular iii) I have no affiliation with LG whatsoever, I bought this on Amazon like everyone else.In my office we have an array of 3D displays from LED screens from various manufacturers that cost $2k to Projectors that cost $20k and beyond, and there is not one of them that does a better job in the home environment than this one does. It's easy to setup, easy to use, the image is sharp, the colors are strong and true and the 3D is spot on. The passive glasses technology is fantastic for the home environment for three reasons i) passive glasses are super cheap and super light ii) no batteries or charging required iii) if you want to bring home the glasses from the movies you can and they work perfectly iv) and this is super important: we have people working with 3D monitors all day long and ALL OF THEM use passive screen technology...why? because it reduces eyestrain which can be an issue if you're watching 3D for an extended period of time with active glasses.What really blows my mind is that these sets are nowhere near the most expensive on the market but I can categorically say that of all the sets that I have seen and used over the last 3 years (samsung, sony etc) I would not buy one of them in preference to the LG set. The ghosting on this set is virtually non-existent something I cannot say for the samsung sets we've had.In closing it works great as a regular TV (I turn off the 120Hz, 240Hz etc because it does things to the image on every tv that's ever had it that as a filmaker makes me want to hurt myself...the best film images in the world look like bad soap tv when you have those things activated and honestly even for sports it leaves me cold). And it works amazing as a 3D TV. Visitors are constantly blown away by how cool the 3D is. And if you're holding out for glasses free tv i) the light passive glasses actually make it much less of an issue ii) you have plenty of time to save up :) we're still years away from a set without glasses that you'd like to have in your living room (and yes I've seen them all, including the prototypes that are still 2 years away from production and they're still nowhere near this tv).If you get one, I hope you enjoy it as much as my family has enjoyed having ours.", "Date": "November 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great tv - I'll TRY to keep this short and simple", "Author": "vince", "ReviewID": "R1KUZ1OP2U6CIN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "With so many reviews for this tv already here and other places, I'll keep this short and to the point.  The price on this tv is GREAT right now, which was the big reason I went for it.  A passive 3d, led lcd, wifi ready 55 inch tv for under 1500?  That's a pretty good deal....Setup:Pretty easy.  I'd say an easy 9/10... there are countless \"setups\" out there for this tv, but really it wouldn't take the average person (who is at least slightly tech-savvy) very long at all to get this tv looking great.  Do whatever you want with the sharpness/tint/color/etc....but as others have suggested, as do I, I would turn off trumotion and put local dimming on low (local dimming helps a bit with black and shadows, but not as much on this tv since it is edge lit).  Basically what I did for the brightness/contrast/backlight was watch a show like Mad Men where there arent TOO many dark scenes, mostly just people, and just get the light levels to the point where the black looks pretty close to true black, but not too dark, but also to the point where the light (especially at the bottom corners) stops \"bleeding\" into the tv.  I think my setup is something like: backlight - 80 contrast - 85 brightness - 65 or something like that....just tweak it until you like what you see.  I will be tweaking the tv for awhile yet, using the expert controls to dial in exactly what i need.  The inputs selection is definetley great, and i can't see many people having issues at all with hooking things up to this tv.  It's pretty straight forward.  Even plugging in usb hard drives is extremely user friendly and takes no brains.Picture/Performance:9/10.  For the price of this tv, I am absolutely blown away.  I can honestly say it has the BEST color of any tv I have ever looked at, and this was obtained, like I said, with some easy tweaking.  The colors absolutely jump out at you.  Compared to the Sony Bravia line, there isn't a single thing I don't like MUCH better about this tv.  Compared to most of Samsung's TV's, however, the picture on the samsung (in my opinion) is slightly sharper and crisper, and I think that is the general consensus, but the color and sheer \"presence\" of this tv is much better.  So when it comes to comparison shopping, it really only comes down to 7 things for most people seriously considering tv's like this:  3D, Wifi, size, picture quality, build quality, ease of use, and price.  The LG takes at least 6 of those things.  The only complaints I have is the fact that there is slight light bleed from the bottom corners, but with a bit of tweaking you can bring a great black picture with minimal light pollution back into this tv.- 3D - amazing....I do not have all that much experience in this field, but am nonetheless blown away.  Must see it for yourself.  passive is so much better than active, too.....it's cheaper....easier and less noticeable to use, and still looks amazing. You can choose 3D options extremely quickly on this tv too, which i also love.  the 2D -> 3D is pretty cool in some movies (HD is pretty much a must here) like harry potter, limitless, planet earth, and a few others i tried.  The option is there, so sometimes I'll use it, and it looks real crisp, but at the same time it feels like you are wasting the tv's true 2D picture quality.  This is why I reserve the 3D for true (side by side) 3d movies.  These look GREAT. I've watched a lot of them, from Hugo and Kung Fu Panda 2 to the Immortals and the Smurfs and Avatar, and many more.  They all look terrific.  not many scenes will come out and grab you, but the added clarity depth of field is very cool.  side note - as stupid of a movie as smurfs was, there's a scene about 10 minutes in with these things flying into a vortex....actually made me and the wife jump, it felt so real.My absolute favorite part of this tv - the wifi. 10/10.  The media sharing is INCREDIBLE.  the first time i went to use it, it prompted me to install \"plex media server.\" and i was a bit put off, realizing i would now need to use a 3rd party program.  After installing it and using it for a few days and learning it, i have to say i am sooooooooooooo satisfied with the program.  me and the wife can both run our own \"media servers\" from our desktop/laptop and access all of our media folders from our tv WITH pictures, episode synopsises, etc. that is all i will really say about it, doesn't take much learning, and is WELL worth buying this tv for if you have a lot of media on your computers (like i do)Build quality 8.5/10I only say this because the screen is so insanely thin, which is a good and bad thing.  The front of the screen can become slightly bent or warped just from shipment, which i have seen reviewers say/post pictures of.  Mine is barely noticeable, but if you were to take a level to most of these tv's I think you would find the front face is not always completely straight.  this does NOT mean this screen won't be straight, just the bezel around it can become (mostly unnoticeably) slightly warped.  I actually very carefully \"bent\" mine back just a slight tad when i got it out of the box, and it is now much better. Also, the stand isn't the greatest.Sound - The speakers are on a 1 inch think screen....so obviously they arent gonna knock you off the couch.  but honestly, for strictly dialogue-based tv shows and late night viewing, or when the volume doesn't need to be up, it's perfect.  clear voice does actually help a good deal, too.  when the wife watches her shows, she never even uses the sound system, theres just no reason to.The bad:Most people have already said all these same things, such as the magic wand remote being retarded....and it is....and I do not use it.  At first I would go back and forth between it and the standard remote, but I have since already gotten used to the standard remote.  The magic wand ISN'T completely useless, however...and I haven't seen anyone say this, but it's nice to have it for typing things into the tv (setting things up, web browsing, etc.)  The stand is yet another thing most people complain about, but it isn't THAT bad....I actually like it, though it may be a little flimsy for such a wide screen.  I don't ever notice wobbling, but I can definetley see people with kids running around (especially on hard wood or tile) having an issue.  I have mine on a glass/metal entertainment center on carpet, so this should never be an issue.  If it was, I would probably just put a thin pad under the stand...problem solved.The viewing angle isn't the greatest, but i have a very wide living room with 2 couches side by side (about 6-7 people can simultaneously be looking at the screen) and to the far sides (the 2 side people) the viewing angle is just starting to fade.  For 90% of movie watching, though, it is unnoticeable, and again, i have very little to compare it to, for all i know this tv has the most usable viewing area in its class, though i have heard that samsung's are slightly better for this.  I know for a fact that bravia's have just about exactly the same viewing angle, if not SLIGHTLY better than the LG.  Too bad bravia's have a crap wifi setup, and subpar picture.  and the whole spyware on their products thing awhile back always put me off of the company.  I don't like gremlins....I haven't messed with this nearly enough to complain about, but with the media sharing (plex) i have noticed the 1080p videos lagging and needing to buffer periodically.  There are numerous forums addressing this issue, and i have tried a few things to no avail THUS FAR.  I have only had this tv for a FEW DAYS, and I am sure I can fix this issue.  Even if i had this issue for years to come, though, i wouldn't even care.  This is because, for a true 1080 HD video, especially in 3d, it may be best to NOT stream it, as you will surely be losing at least a little quality.  Any true high def 1080p videos really deserve to be on a hard drive attached to the tv or on a disc.  I will provide an update as to whether or not i have fixed this, and what i did to fix it.That being said - the 720p and the rest of the media i have streamed to this tv LOOKS AMAZING. it isn't quite as flawless as if you were watching a blu ray or even directly off of a hard drive into the tv, but it certainly doesn't look like you are watching youtube.  for 90% of my content (really only excluding 3d 1080p movies) the streaming plex media player does an incredible job.9/10 product.  with only a 5 star system - i had to go with 5/5I would def. buy this again, for the same price or lower.

WOW!", "Author": "John Rodriguez", "ReviewID": "R2UC1ZZZJRJR30", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I searched and viewed so many HDTV reviews (mainly form CNET)& read plenty of customer reviews. For the money, this HDTV has won me over in every aspect! The first thing that WOWED me out of the box was how thin the TV was out of the box, it seems no thicker then an inch, very nice. Then the picture & color was very nice out of the box. Then I tweaked some configurations then I got the WOW moment from the picture. Unlike most of the customer reviews that I read, it seemed that very few people were actually looking for a 3D TV, well I was.  I wanted to have something to show family and friends when that come over, you know, something they haven't seen yet. The 2D-3D conversion was nothing to great, but was cool non-the-less, Gave it a cool looking depth perception. Then I tried 3D gaming on the PS3 (Call of Duty: Black Ops zombies) then I got the WHOA moment, not WOW, WHOA. At first kinda gave me a filling of being cross-eyed. My eyes adjusted, got better/bigger weapons then it started to give me that semi-wow moment. Wasn't playing online, but playing in 3D gave it a little (online filling, but not nearly as bad)lag, also got a little eye soreness but no headache. All in all, it was pretty frickin' cool playing in 3D.  Then I tried a Blu-Ray 3D movie (fright Night 3D) and once again, it gave me that WOW moment continually. The picture was clear, if not seemed clearer then full 1080p picture, as life-like as it gets. Never got the cross-eyed filling at all, it more-less gave me the filling that the movie was being directed and shot through a window in my home, one continues shot without the directer screaming CUT! (TV is mounted, giving it that window filling) If you don't have a 3D yet, you've got to get one, preferably this 3D HDTV. The Cinema 3D experience is way cooler/better at home then the 3D you see at the movies.  On another note, the apps are cool, use Netflix all the time with the magic remote. (some people say the magic remote doesn't work for Netflix) The picture is really clear too. The browser works, but not the fastest engine for a browser. Kinda like browsing on a 3G android phone. But it does work, already set up a few favorite for the quickest use. Facebook app is pretty cool too, can click and view pics right on the TV. The only negative thing to say about any of the apps that I do use is You Tube, it doesn't seem to allow me to log in with my You Tube account. So I can't view my favorites or do anything that's associated with my You Tube account. It just starts playing videos the moment the app loads up, but it does allow you to search videos while the videos are playing, kinda weird for You Tube though.  I bought this HDTV because of the big 3. 3D Compatibility, Picture quality, and Internet Connectivity. Out of all the research and video reviews and customer reviews, it all lead to this TV or the LG Plasma 60PZ950. I choose this TV because of the LED technology and the cost of the glasses. Not to mention this HDTV came with 4 pairs of classes and the 60PZ950 came with none, and those glasses cost 70 buck a piece. For that reason alone I choose passive over active and I could not be happier with my decision.

However, 3D viewing requires more brightness, so for those events we generally turn it off, and it pulls about 120W* Low-cost 3D glasses - yes it comes with 4 glasses, but we wanted a few more for friends, and at about $5 each, its a bargain* Viewing angle is great for LCD.  My living room is wide and shallow, and when I have guests, they can see the TV just fine from 60 degrees off center.* Good streaming support - Comes with Netflix, Hulu+, Amazon VOD, and Vudu (which we don't use).--- Netflix has been reliable and is easy to navigate - it presents recommendations and new releases well, but the PC is a better interface for searching.  HD looks sharp and only rarely does a frame skip or rebuffering take place (we're using FIOS for internet).  It sometimes forgets that you have completed an episode and says that the already played episode is the \"next\" one.  This is easy to workaround by asking it to show all episodes and picking the latest one that hasn't been watched/completed.  After that it works well for a few episodes. --- Hulu+ we use occasionally.  It take a while to load the App, but it is good after that - has a good browsing interface.  Streaming has been pretty reliable, but \"HD\" isn't impressive - we have FIOS which has _plenty_ of bandwidth.  If you stop a show and return later, it sometimes forgets where you were, placing you a few commercials back or forcing you to start from the beginning.  Fast forwarding works, but we often miss our mark and have to rewind again.  Using the \"mouse\" helps, if you can get the pointer to show up on the screen.--- Amazon VOD - we don't use it much, but I was very impressed with the HD quality!Cons====* Smart TV--- Are there any good apps, really?  Searching for apps is a pain, then I didn't t find anything worth installing.  I don't think this mouse is good enough for games, I get annoyed using it.--- The \"Home\" screen confuses my wife with apps she doesn't use and having to navigate the complex menu - I recommend the \"Premium\" screen, simple and direct* Streaming lacks some popular content such as Crackle and Pandora* Mouse usability - the pointer will sometimes disappear and I can't get it back when I want it* Auto mode of Energy Efficiency - generally too dark, sometimes too bright, never just right* Changing Energy Efficiency is annoying.  Yes, they have a dedicated button for this, but rather than toggling it directly, it opens a menu that you have to navigate with the arrow keys, press Enter, then press Exit, and finally it puts a big Energy Efficiency Meter on the screen for 5 seconds - too cumbersome and slow", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "great tv", "Author": "ted", "ReviewID": "R2A8DNRO1KO9J8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a pretty solid TV. I got mine in about 2-3 months ago and it is still working great.I'm just going to list several notes since I've seen most of the same things from a lot of these reviews.- The TV's sound is good enough for regular use. Anyone who complains about the lack of speakers in a TV this thin is stupid... if they cared about their sound that much they would already have a sound system set up and wouldn't need the TV speakers.- The internet dongle isn't very good. However, I have my PS3 / PC hooked up to the HDMI inputs and I just stream my stuff from those.- 3d live sports is not great yet. I have verizon FIOS and that only gives me 2 3d channels... mostly they play College football on them. The quality of the picture is not that great but it is still cool to see sports in 3d. Just lower your standards a  bit and its good enough.- I have a lot of video game systems. All of them work great on the TV, although this TV really makes it show how bad graphics used to be. One problem I've had is that my N64 does not work with this TV but does with others. All the colors glitch every few seconds. I tried this with 2 different N64 setups and see the same thing. Not sure if it is just my TV or if this is a software problem.- TruMotion is worthless unless you are watching animal planet or something. It causes delay on the Wii and mouse movements for my computer. Sometimes it causes sound sync problems. I leave it off most of the time.- The picture is really good. I just took someone's settings I saw in a review on here and they work great.- The magic motion controller or whatever is okay. It is a cool gimmick, but I never end up using it.- The LG apps that are not mainstream on the TV are awful.- The stand is MEANT to be able to turn side to side. I don't understand how people can review this TV and say that they are not sure if the TV can turn or not. It is clearly meant for that. Make sure you put it together in the right order... I don't remember what that order is but it only works one way (I think hook the TV up to it first then attach to stand?).- I got 10 pairs of free 3d glasses with my TV. They are nice. I switching two pairs so they were left / left and right / right lenses so I could play video games that were split screen in full screen (each player sees their screen as full screen) and it works fine with this TV. I am waiting for someone to come out with 3d glasses that do this so I don't have to do a crappy job popping lenses in and out.- Passive vs active 3d : passive is so much better. lighter. cheaper. no batteries. no headaches. anyone who buys an active 3d tv is a fool who thinks that paying more money = better without doing any research. All this 3d technology is probably going to be way better in a year or two, so why pay top dollar for something that will be obsolete in a short time? Get the cheap one for now.- I have heard there is some lag for gaming when compared to plasma TV's... I don't notice it with TRUmotion off. When I use my computer there is no mouse movement delay after its set right.Overall, great TV. Colors are great. Darkness is great (I play Dead Space on it). Shipping was fine. I don't notice any lighting issues with the LED's in the TV like some people mention. Any bad review I've seen is just too critical. Nobody is going to notice the stuff they have problems with. You get an awesome TV for 2/3 of what everyone else pays.Let me know if anyone else sees the same problem with N64 color glitches...UPDATE:I finally figured out what was going on with the color glitches. First of all, it is was not just with my N64... it was with A/V jacks in general. Apparently I had to be in expert mode (game mode had glitches) on the TV to get rid of the glitches. I think the TV was doing some processing on the signal that it should not have been.

Also got the promo of the family pack of glasses for free, and those are great for the kids, and for my friends who have glasses (clip-ons; great idea).WHY?Bought this to replace a 42\" Panasonic plasma, which I love, and it served me well these past 6 years. I was hesitant to go to LED/LCD as I watch hockey, which is a fast paced game. When I initially bought my Panny in 2005, LCD was not even an option... it was waaaay to blurry for sports. Anyone worried about blur on an LCD need not worry; at least on this unit.SET-UP:Easy. Internet set-up just as easy. The wii-type controller does make browsing simpler for sure. Menus are easy to navigate. Usually there is always one setting that is in some obscure place within a tv menu, but everything in this unit is where it belongs. Got some good specs for calibration on-line and easy (I highly recommend tweaking the out-of-box settings). Google \"47lw5600 calibration\" and you'll get lots of results.PICTURE:Wow.... going from my 6 yr old Panny to this was like going from a well-tuned corvette to a lambourghini... both good, but leagues apart. The picture quality, once calibrated is very good. Out of the box I was not that pleased, but once tweaked (using normal menu settings, no fancy secret codes required) it is stunning. This is an excellent 2D tv for the price. Viewing range for us is about 10' and it's perfect. Holds up incredibly well in daylight.. a million times better than our plasma did, and at night very sharp as well (I recommend playing with the settings for daytime and nighttime viewing).3D:Once I figured out I had to re-calibrate my PS3 under Display Settings (thank you IGN)....Surpisingly good. Anyone ripping on passive not being \"true HD\" must have implanted eagle eyes.... While this may be true from a technical sense, my eyes like it just fine. Playing games in 3D on the PS3 is actually very cool (and I used to rip on a buddy who swears by 3D gaming...I am converted). The glasses are light (especially the family pack ones that are more custom fit), and within about 5 mins you forget you are wearing them.

Having the wireless internet feature is also fun - I watched a streaming video from netflix - which had a great picture but my dsl internet connection was too slow so it needed to stop and build the buffer every 5-10 minutes.

First was LED vs DLP vs Plasma, and the second was whether or not to go 3D.i opted for the LED TVs because it will be hooked up to a FiOS box, a PS3 (for bluray), and probably a computer. I know that plasma has come a long way but I still can see the burn-in from the DVR guide on my friend's 2 yr old plasma. I rather be safe then sorry when spending over $1k. The next item that makes it worth it is energy consumption... it uses less energy and therefore produces less heat (I think one reviewer measured it at 80-100 watts at his settings).I decided to go 3D because, at that price, whats another few bucks for a cheap thrill. i don't believe that 3D tech has settled yet, so I can't understand why I would put hundreds of dollars into active shutter glasses.

When I got it I was unimpressed.  I owned a 46-inch 1080p Samsung before it that is still beautiful to watch.  The picture on the LG was VERY grainy and pixelated.  I tried different settings and reset it to factory defaults to no avail.  I went to different sites and used their suggested settings (even settings offered by those here) and it only made the picture more \"fuzzy\" and out-of-focus to cover up the grainy image.2D:Now I know close up at 55-inches you're gonna see pixels, but this was different, it was like the picture was  compressed into a low-quality output, then blown up, like a digital zoom.  My settings were 16x9.  The picture was just off.  Even black backgrounds had way too much artifact.  It was an assault on my eyes - especially after plunking down my hard-earned dough.  Booting up the TV showed the gratuitous LG logo for 5 to 7 seconds and I could see a white bleeding of light waving all around the border (which my friend also noticed and thought it was bad).3D:This was fantastic.  I NEVER played 3-D content, but I did try the 2D-3D conversion using cable programming and it was pretty cool.  I loved using the passive 3D glasses.  The white and radioactive-orange colored ones that came with the TV will have you looking like an american idol reject.  You'll look cooler wearing the ones from the local movie theater.The Return:I ended up returning this thing and going with the more expensive Samsung UN55D7900 55-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D LED HDTV (Silver).  It was over half a grand more and uses active-shutter glasses, which adds even more to the overall price.  I regret buying that TV too, but that's another story for another review.I noticed on the LG TV that the banner at the bottom, that shows what channel I'm on (displayed by my cable box), looked clipped at the ends.  The corners weren't rounded off like I remembered them.  When I swapped this out for the Samsung I noticed the rounded corners were back.  This told me something indeed was wrong with my LG set.  Maybe there was a setting I could have used to fix it, or maybe it was just calibrated wrong at the factory - I dunno.  But now I'm stuck with my Samsung - whose 2D viewing experience is unsurpassed.Active vs. Passive 3D:I did my research and read a bunch of blogs where these two technologies were compared.  Some (even Samsung's site) claiming your eyes are only seeing half the resolution with Passive, and others saying, no each eye gets half the resolution, but your brain processes it into full resolution, yaddy-yaddy-yadda.Well, I'm here to tell you that Passive is the clear champion.  Beats me what those bloggers were smoking.  Active sucks.Active:Active glasses are expensive, easy to break, you have to charge them or buy batteries for them, and they're not as cool.  That's just the glasses, the picture is also not as good - I don't care what anyone else says - I have seen it with my own eyes!With active, my eyes could \"sense\" the glasses at all times.  Tracking an item with your eye on the screen, or moving your focus from one part of the screen to another, causes a weird sensation.  Almost like the shuttering of the glasses went out of sync with your eyes as they glanced across the screen.It's a very uncomfortable viewing experience for something that I paid hundreds of dollars more to view.  Also, I only had enough for two pairs of glasses, so everyone else is sol.Passive:With passive everything looked better - even better than when I was using 2D.  Images were sharp and crisp.  I have young nieces and nephews that visit, and the idea of spinning up a CGI cartoon and throwing some movie theater glasses at them would have been fun.  I can't do that with the active shutters - I'd stress over them accidentally breaking them - and again, I only have 2 of those and 7 nieces and nephews.I really miss flipping on the 2D-3D setting because it is unwatchable on a Samsung, whereas with an LG it was fun to watch (especially with cartoons).Passive FTW!Verdict:Even after returning this set I'm giving it 4 stars ONLY because everyone here raves on about this thing and I don't want to tick them off and have them flame me with comments.  Maybe the TV they have is justifiably awesome, but something was definitely wrong with mine when viewing 2D content.  My regret is that I didn't ask for an LG replacement and instead went with Samsung's active-shutter technology (which I hope dies a fiery death).", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "A quick look", "Author": "E.

I ordered in on Tuesday and it arrived 3 days later. I was a bit nervous about Pilot since I saw some negative reviews but my experience is very positive.I have only played with it for a couple of days. The major minus is the \"flashlighting\" issue. I understand that many LCD panels have this issue. This tv has this around the edge on one side and around a couple of corners. One minor issue is that the standby light did not come on the second day. Perhaps it was just a glitch. I reset it in the setup and it was fine. I finally decided not to have the standby light. I am using the calibration given in this forum.1) The flashlighting issue is more profound than on my Sony 52XBR4. My other flat screen tv is a 42\" Panasonic 720p plasma, which the lg is replacing. (The Panasonic does not have this issue. I think in general this does not occur in plasma tv.)2) The picture quality is very good. I don't think the black level is quite as good the Panasonic but I am just a causal viewer so it is good enough for me. I also think that it compares well to the Sony at 1/3 of the cost. (Sure it is a larger tv and it was a few years back.)3) 2D->3D conversion is quite interesting. I know that it can't do magic but I think it is quite good and I am very happy with the result. The effect is best when you have stationary scenes. For example, its 3D effect is very good during the French Open especially seeing the spectators in the stand.4) I really like the swirl stand and the TV is so thin compare to my Panasonic.5) There is no way for me to use a wired connection so I used the wireless option. I wish they have the \"build-in\" wireless rather than plugging in the dongle (which is included with the TV). I prefer the build in version so that it doesn't take away a USB slot.6) I like having a headphone jack on the TV.7) The second component connection is very interesting. It only has one connection for a combined video connection. I don't know whether it will degrade the signal. Since I won't be using it, it is not an issue.8) The magic remote is ok. As other have said, it is like the Wii remote. However, it doesn't allow you to calibrate so if you sit to the side, you have to compensate.9) I was not able to get DLNA to work. To be honest, I didn't try very hard. On my LG BD 570, I really don't have to do anything and it picks up the service from my macbook pro. So I expect the same for the LG TV but it did not see it. Since it is unlikely that I would be using this, it is no big deal. (If I really need to use it, I will figure it out.)10) I tried reading a 3D mp4 video file from a thumb drive via the USB connection once, it seems to work.11) The glasses are very light. I understand the con of the passive 3D with resolution being reduced. I watched Tron Legacy 3D via vudu and I think it is very good.12) The TV seems to have a limited size of build-inmemory. I didn't install any new apps and I see that I only 258M.Overall, I give it a B+ taken into account of price and performance.", "Date": "June 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great 3D LED LCD", "Author": "Toby", "ReviewID": "R7HKOMKBRHZ18", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There is WAY too much to consider when making a purchase of this kind.  I have had this set for about 2 mos now, and I have no complaints.  I have done extensive research on 3D, LCD, LED LCD, and Plasma (previously using a 50 inch plasma).  Knowing I wanted a 3D tv, I read up on and tested many individual brands and tvs. In my opinion, the 3D quality of both active shutter and passive 3D is the same.  Some people will argue that active shutter is clearer, crisper, and more 3 dimentional.  I personally found this to not be true.  The only reason I believe some sets may look \"better\" than others, is becasue of the indepth settings controls that most sets have now, which can be altered to your tastes.  In the end, I believe it is the viewers preference.  From my perspective, they all looked great after tweeking a little here and there.  My reason for buying this passive model, was to have glasses that I would not need to remember to recharge, or set heavily and uncomfortably on my face.  Again in my opinion, Im not losing out on anything with the passive glasses.  LG is a great brand, and is priced nicely for the size.  There is no pixilation during fast moving scenes with the correct connections, (that I have encountered anyway), and I am very happy that I selected this model and the LG brand.", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beautiful TV for the Price", "Author": "Jason McCartney", "ReviewID": "RHDVHZ4BUYII4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The first thing that struck me when I unboxed my 55LW5600 was how thin it is.  I was replacing a Toshiba 52XV545U and flat panel technology has improved greatly since 2009.  I was almost afraid to lift it. :)  But when I did, I was struck by how solid and well-constructed the panel itself feels.  It's thin and pretty light, but it's rigid - no creaks or moans from the casing as you pick it up.  My only complaint on construction is that the included foot stand is pretty wimpy - it gets the job done, and does allow horizontal angling, but it feels flimsy and has less precision than I'd like it to have.Hook-up was super simple.  There are 4 HDMI ports easily accessible at the left (standing in front of the TV) rear of the panel.  One cable per device, and the TV does the rest.  The wireless network was easy to set up - the TV set comes with an included wireless USB dongle that you just plug into one of the two open ports on the back - there's also a port for an ethernet cable if you'd rather go wired.The picture itself is amazing.  Almost painfully bright and vivid on the stock settings.  After messing with the settings for a while, I found the ones that work best for me in my space and it looks beautiful.  There are zero visible lazy or dead pixels, and I haven't been able to see any video artifacts caused by the display.  That said, the display will tend to show any flaws in your video sources, so you might become dissatisfied with some content - particularly some of the \"HD\" content from your cable provider.  There is a picture setting for automatically adjusting the backlight and other settings with an \"intelligent sensor\".  I found the picture under that setting to often be too dim, so I ended up abandoning it for a variation of the standard settings with the backlight set around the middle of the range. I started with some settings from a well known AV forum and worked from there until I had the look I wanted.  One nice thing for me is that this TV has a lot of range, and I didn't have to max anything out to get where I wanted to be - even in a brightly lit room.  I haven't noticed much backlight bleed at the edges - even in the dark.  I'm not saying it's not there at all, but it's not at a level that bothers me in any way.The passive 3D is pretty awesome with the right content.  The set comes with four pairs of lightweight, polarized glasses that look and feel pretty cheap, but work pretty well.  I'm discovering that 3D is ALL about the content.  If you want to be amazed, watch something like Despicable Me in 3D - the depth and resolution really draws you in.  For me, though, it's still just a novelty and the grand majority of content I watch on the set is 2D.  It's worth noting that, if you have a Playstation 3, the Playstation Store actually has some decent 3D content available online.The sound was acceptable, but like most built-in speakers, was kind of \"Meh\".  It's functional, but don't expect miracles in volume, dynamics, or clarity.  I certainly don't recommend the sound for movie watching or gaming.  I pretty quickly hooked the optical audio output to a Bose 1SR sound bar and turned off the TV speakers - that put it right in the sweet spot for me.The \"smart TV\" software is better than expected.  The menus are easy to access, and even more so with the included free motion remote (swing it around in the air and it controls a cursor on screen).  There are quite a few video apps that let you watch content from various online providers like Amazon Instant Video or Netflix, and they seem to work pretty well.  There's not a lot of lag in the menu system.  The typing interface can be a little clunky, but again, the motion remote makes it much better.  It would make a good stand-alone system, although I still find myself using my Playstation 3 or Apple TV to watch Netflix content because I just like the interface a tad bit better.  Another reason is that I have all of the gear programmed into a Harmony universal remote, which only supports standard navigation (click for up/down/left/right/etc), and I often can't be bothered to go get the motion remote that makes the TV menus so much easier to use. :)Overall, I'm very impressed with this set for the money.  I was a little nervous about buying LG, but they've really come a long way in the last few years.  I would recommend this display wholeheartedly to any of my friends.", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG 55lw5600 AWESOME!!!", "Author": "sje3156", "ReviewID": "R1985720L0HEOV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok I just got my USED (from amazon warehouse deals) 55\" LG 3D tv and let me start by saying WOW!!! Never in my dreams did I think passive 3D could be this good. First off Amazon did a superb job shipping this TV it came right on time as said and they even trough in white glove service at no xtra cost. The guy brought the TV in my house for and opened it to ensure nothing was damaged. The TV did have a minor scuff mark on the back which nobody will ever see cause its on my wall. This TV is incrediblly thin, the picture is great to me the settings dont even need to be adj. at all but I always have to adj one every time I get one but i ended up resetting factory settings and just added a little more color. This TV gives you that fake look you know the one where it feels like you are right there on the set watching them film the movie. The internet is cool apps are limited right now but in time as these TVs get in more homes im sure they will have more netfilx is all im gonna use anyways (unless something really cool comes out in the app store). And as if all this wasnt enough I switched it in 3D mode and totally blew me away. It wasnt even a 3D movie I just converted it and the depth was incredible more than I expected. When I played an actual 3D movie I swear im not kidding when i say this it had so much depth to it my kids where sitting on the floor infront of me and my wife and a part on yogi bear at the beganing when yogi slides across the table and the chips go flying the chips actually looked as though they where coming past there heads and they where sitting about 5 feet from the tv,it was incredible. This is my forth LG TV and i can say they really know how to build a TV, they are not the cheapest but also far from the most expensive and for what you pay LG is great.I know sometimes people might get a bad one but every TV maker has bad ones the only reason the more expensive brands dont have as many bad reviews for \"the bad ones\" is because they dont sell as many as the cheap ones so therefor less chance for someone to get a bad one. So for those reviews where people are haten on LG cause they got a bad one ignore them. Well thats it for my review I hope this helped you in deciding to buy.

I think the feature is often overlooked, you can read the other reviews on picture quality, smart features, etc...When I started looking for a new TV 3D was not on my list of \"must have features\". I bought the 55LW5600 because of its picture quality, price and size. I used to think that 3D TV's were a fad and I would never care to own one of my own. Mostly because I didn't believe that there would ever be enough 3D content out to make it worth while.However with a 2D to 3D converter built into this TV, it makes every video source a 3D source.Once I had the TV at home and installed I gave the 2D to 3D converter a try. I was amazed, the effect works better then you can imagine I encourage you to walk into a store and check it out.So far I have watched a dozen movies with the 3D converter enabled. The 3D effect is done well. It isn't an exaggerated 3D effect, things don't pop-out of the screen, instead the effect is like looking out a window. This is actually the way it SHOULD be, as eye popping effects will quickly cause eye fatigue and give you a headache.What is more amazing is that I don't have to buy 3D movies. I don't have a 3D Blu-Ray player, or compatible 3D HDMI receiver. I can watch True Grit streaming from NetFliX in 3D, watch the Walking Dead in 3D, you name it. So far high definition sources seem to work the best. A few of my DVDs were hit or miss. The Matrix on DVD for example looks great, but some scenes where there was too much contrast the 3D effect was diminished. BluRay sources however have all worked wonderfully. Watching the epic panning shots in Lord of the Rings with 3D enabled is a whole new experience.A final note on the 3D glasses. This TV uses passive 3D. That means no expensive, heavy, or costly shutter glasses. The 3D glasses are simple light weight plastic. This also means they are more prone to scratches then with glass. So you must take care not to toss them in with the pile of remotes. However since they cost ~$5 to replace it isn't a huge deal if you have to replace them down the road.Owning this TV has changed my opinion on 3D movies at home.

I normally buy and just let it go.  But this TV has impressed me so much that I thought I'd at least put my two cents out there for others.I ordered it for a great price on here. The shipping was free and was considered \"white glove\" which I believe means they bring it in, put the stand on it, and make sure it works before leaving. I live on the third floor of an apartment building and the guys brought it all the way up and did exactly that.I have a Samsung 50\" plasma that has a great picture that this is replacing. Why did I buy it?  Mainly because of the 3D hype and being the first in my family to have that. I know, not the best reason for it but I thought I'd at least try it out.  If I didn't like it, it would go back.I actually bought it without going to a big block store to see it first because of the price here. The next day I decided to go see it in person at our local store. Sadly I was disappointed there. The TV had some film trailers in 3D that they were demo'ing and they didn't really make it shine. I told myself not to get to disappointed and waited until mine came.  And I'm glad I did.Once I got mine I downloaded some files from the net including an official LG 3D demo with this fish that comes out of the screen about halfway between you and the screen.  Now I was totally impressed! One thing, I sit about 7 feet back from the screen.  Slightly closer and I noticed the interlace lines from the 3D.  But from where I was it looked like 1080p.I had issues with getting the wii style remote to connect to my TV. Once I connected my TV to the internet and it updated to the new firmware it connected instantly. I also noticed that the interlace lines I originally saw when I was closer to the screen were much harder to see. From research it seems that LG has updated the algorithm in a newer firmware to make them less noticeable and it works!Also, if you google you'll find that you can activate a THX setting for regular and 3D content that makes the TV look outstanding! And if you do a lot of media streaming through the TV that you can also activate a dolby digital passthrough. Otherwise it limits you to 2 channels.Some people have complained about the TV having video game lag.  After searching the forums I found a few tricks that make this go away completely (labeling the input as PC and putting it in on HDMI input 3). I have no issues at all with lag. I play a lot of video games so this was important to me.A few tips - turn off \"tru motion\" to get the TV to look natural with the movements.  Also turn on local dimming to \"HIGH\" to get the TV to really shine on contrast.  It'll pretty much make the backlighting disappear on a dark scene from the edges.  Works great!With the proper settings this TV looks 10 times better then my Samsung plasma does. I'm super happy with my purchase and would do it again in a heartbeat. This TV looks and acts like a TV costing a good thousand more.Update - 2D to 3D works pretty good but really depends on the material you are watching.  I watched a nature show with in on and it looked amazing. Also, you should hard wire the TV to the internet (don't use the wifi). I just read someone complaining about Netflix looking pretty bad on some motion material, but with the faster wired connection I don't see any artifacts. TV plays MKV files perfectly if you are into downloading, and there are a lot of 3D MKV files out there that work flawlessly on this TV.  Use the \"Plex Media Server\" that you can google on the web.  It's free and sponsored by LG.

As far as the wifi setup goes it's easy enough;  took a little effort, but if you are tech savvy, like most people, it's not a pain.  As far as screen resolution goes, I think LG does just as good a job with screen resolution as any competitor.  As far as calibration, you have to do your homework -  it helps if you read a few websites (i.e., cnet, hdtvreviewlab) to get suggested settings. the LG firmware provides a configuration screen and allows you to choose what seems best for your viewing pleasure.

I see no blur during sports or action movies.I have had no issues with ghosting or flash lighting or blooming or clouding or any of the other negatives that have been mentioned in other reviews regarding the picture.  Not saying they didn't have issues.  Just saying I haven't had any.I like the matte screen because of where my TV is placed.  Reflections are minimal.The 2D picture is very nice.  Take the time to find a couple different recommendations for calibrating the picture.  I went through 3 before deciding which one I liked, then tweaked it a little more to suit me.I have watched several 3D movies with my kids (Tangled, Gnomio & Juliet, A Christmas Carol, How to Train Your Dragon to mention a few) and I have been blown away by the quality.  I have seen 3D movies at the cinema and at IMAX 3D, and the 3D on this set is at the same level in my opinion.  It looks like I could dive right in to the scene at times.  I'm not sure what the 3D hate is about in some of the reviews.  The 3D picture is outstanding.  No one in my family has experienced any ill side effects while watching any movie or show.I also have a PS3 connected and have played Uncharted 3 in 3D and it is super cool.  No negatives whatsoever running PS3 in any mode.  No audio sync issues.  No delay issues.  Absolutely zero blurring.The 2D to 3D upconvert is probably the only thing I don't care for.  It is cool to see it work, but is definitely not the same quality as movies and shows designed for 3D viewing.  Also I do tend to get a little eye strain while viewing with this feature turned on.  Probably just me but whatever.  Not a deal breaker in any sense.I have updated the firmware whenever requested by the TV and have had no issues with any of the updates or any of the Smart features. I noticed some having issues with Flash or other firmware issues.  All I can say is I have had none.I installed a range extender for my wireless signal because of the distance from my TV to my router/wi-fi.

Qty (10) Active 3D glasses from Panasonic would cost $1,500 (Mfg suggested).Setup with Comcast cable box was difficult.  No audio over HDMI cable.  I thought there was a hardware problem (bad HDMI cables or TV).  Eventually found out you need to change the cable box menu settings for HDMI audio.  Then I have an older audio receiver without HDMI connections.  I thought I could run the audio from the TV to the audio receiver using the optical port.  But it appears the 55LW5600 optical port only outputs 2.1 audio.  So I ended up running the cable video to the TV by HDMI, and cable audio to the receiver by optical cable.Also, wireless setup had problems.  In the end, it appears the original WPA2 encryption key on my wireless network was too long for the LG set.  When I changed the WPA2 key  to just 11 characters, the TV was able to connect to the network.My only remaining concern is the screen occasionally goes completely black for 1 to 2 seconds at random.

I had a hard time deciding between this one and a comparable plasma. It seems like everybody that buys an LED LCD loves it and everybody that buys a plasma loves it. The only thing I could find that actually applied to me was lighting condition. My impression from going through tons of website reviews was that LED LCD is better in rooms with moderate light leaking through the windows.

All I can tell you is that in my living room with a lot of windows I can see the TV just fine at noon.GAMERS:Input lag was a pretty big concern for me. There are 3 gamers in my house. It was pretty bad at first. Don't even try 3D on a fast paced game. Have no fear though. With a few short clicks it all went away. If you don't trust me then trust my teen who lives inside of COD:MW3. Make sure your tv is in game mode. Also, [I'm taking this one on faith from more than one website] change the label of the input to PC. Not sure if this had an impact but either way, I have no measurable input lag. Also, the pixel response time is fast enough that I don't have trails either.2D->3D conversion:My only experience with this is on an episode of Spongebob I used for background noise while I was getting everything set up. I tried on the glasses, put it in 2D->3D mode and voila. Everything had a slight texture. Nothing spectacular but pretty cool nonetheless.

The picture is already good!I have fed it several Blue Ray discs - and the picture quality is great.  I have not used the 3-D very much so I don't feel qualified to comment in depth.  But using the 2D to 3D up-conversion is interesting - if not all that useful. I appreciate the non-glare screen and have no problems viewing the TV in my very bright family room.My video comes from Netflix, the blu-ray player, and Cox Cable (without the cable box).  This means that I actually use this set's tuner to tune the cable channels.  This setup illustrated a couple of deficiencies - which is why I docked this set one star. While, the setup menu is fairly inclusive, there are some glaring omissions:- You cannot label channels.  So, if the auto-program fails to register channel 69 as the Weather Channel, I have no way of labeling it as such.  I have this capability on my cheap little VIZIO - so this is pretty poor.- The use of 'favorites' is very cumbersome.  On my old LG, pressing the `favorites' button cycles you to the 'next' favorite channel.  It was quick and effective to see what 'else' was on. This new TV takes you to an intermediate menu where you have to select the next channel and then select enter.  I find this annoying and slow.- The most aggravating shortcoming of this set is the lack of aspect ratio settings.  It has the basic 4:3, 16:9, and 'set by program'.  But LG has eliminated the two 'fixed' zoom selections in favor of something called Cinema Zoom.  On my old LG, when I watched a SDTV channel with additional top and bottom letterboxing (which allows a 'widescreen' picture to be displayed on a standard 4:3 screen), I was able to select zoom1 or zoom2, which expanded the actual picture to take up my entire screen.  The 'new' cinema zoom only stretches the picture horizontally - so you still see the top and bottom letterbox.  Thus the picture's true ratio is stretched horizontally - but you can't expand it vertically (alone).  As my old LG didn't have this problem, it's disappointing that the new one is so limited.  I have a hope that they'll fix this in a future SW upgrade - but I'm not sure if this feature is programmable.Speaking of internet apps, it has a bunch as listed in the description.  I have used Netflix and YouTube.  Occasionally, Netflix loses synch with my wireless network.  But rebooting my wireless cable box/router usually solves the problem - but not always.  I have twice had to come back later to finish a netflix movie.  I also just upgraded the OS via wireless.  It took about 15 tries for it to finally download all the way.  I'm not ready to blame this on the TV.So overall, I think that this set is worth the price and would buy it again.  I WISH there was a product feedback place so that at least future LG purchaser wouldn't have the current shortcomings.  Even morel, I wish that these shortcomings could be addressed in a SW upgrade.

I'm a geeky super tech junkie. I follow tech like crazy so know my info here is not only research it has all been fully tested on this set. First off, no HDTV does apps very well so if you're considering this or any set for the apps, forget it. Some sets do them well but blu-ray players do them much better. Even the highest end Samsung has problems with apps. There are also complaints about the TV splitting the resolution for 3D. This is only true for some 3D, like on the Xbox 360 or any other device using a stereoscopic display that is intended to force the TV to create the 3D effect. If you have a 3D blu-ray player this is not the case. A 3D blu-ray player will do FULL 1080p 3D. So this is movie theater quality 3D. Since this set uses passive 3D you actually get the full 3D effect like in the theater with no batteries or heavy glasses. It's comfortable with no headaches or issues. It looks amazing. I was against getting a 3D TV until I saw this in a store and noticed it actually worked. Active glasses looked terrible but this blew me away.For gaming it's super crisp and amazing. You might notice a slight judder or ghost on very fast games but not really on movies or anything. I've only noticed it with games that have a lot of super bright colors. The TV does have some lag with audio so expect that. The audio sounds tin like and not realistic, it's actually pretty bad. I recommend everyone has a receiver anyway. If you have a high end HDTV, you just look foolish not having at least a cheap receiver with some low end speakers. A good receiver with even halfway decent speakers will make your home sound like an IMAX. You really aren't taking full advantage of blu-ray discs or even your games if you're just watching this amazing picture with completely horrible 3 inch TV speakers. Do yourself a favor and consider a new receiver/speaker set before a new TV.The TV comes with 2 controllers, one is a point controller like the Wii. I never use it. The browser on the TV is okay but the network on the TV is spotty. If you're networking with a computer to watch a video file it's great. If you're trying to stream something or connect to the Internet, interestingly it connects through a server in India...... like that makes sense. I traced its connection to figure out why my TV was getting less than 1Mbps while my computer was getting 16Mbps. That's why.This TV has insane customization features. You can customize not only RGB values but CMY as well. You can also customize it for every input individually plus the media. Using a USB stick to watch something? You can customize that separately. It's awesome for those who like their colors accurate. True Motion has an off feature or custom feature. I never use it, it's a great way to kill a movie. The backlight control and dimming feature makes the blacks actually black. It looks just as black as it does when the TV is off. That's probably the best feature, it looks realistic and great. I am actually able to custom set my TV to look as amazing as a movie did in the theater. It also has ARC which allows you to control your receiver through the TV. The USB thumb option works great. The TV includes the option to turn off the glowing power symbol, which I love to keep off at all times.Overall I haven't had a single complaint about this set other than the audio. I really didn't like the way it sounded plus with the speakers facing the back it can sound rather quiet. The 47\" does make a huge difference over the standard 46. If I could choose again I would still go with this set. At that price, no other set beats or even meets the features this TV offers. Your TV shouldn't tell you what you think it should look like. Custom features are more important than people realize. I've also watched some 3D blu-ray movies on this and do want to mention that it is possible to watch 3D blu-ray with an HDMI 1.3 cable. The players say they require 1.4 but if you have a 1.3 cable try it first before getting a 1.4. You might not need it. However if you're running TrueHD with 3D through a receiver, you will need a set of 1.4 HDMI cables otherwise you will run into cutouts.One last thing. If you're looking for a decent HDTV and you're trying to decide between this and a Vizio or something else not top tier name brand, please do yourself a favor and go with this. Vizio talks big but LG has proven with this set that you can make a cheap TV and still have high quality. Vizio is typically anything but high quality and their sets have issues with reds. This set renders every color amazingly bright and has a very full color spectrum. I used to have a DLP and didn't think I could get used to an LCD, but this set made me forget about my DLP.", "Date": "October 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "LG Infinia 55LW5600", "Author": "Let's Go Pens", "ReviewID": "R1IB99QSVEBB9F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My wife and I purchased this TV from Amazon on Sunday evening, and it was at our doorstep by Wednesday afternoon.  As always, payment and shipment with Amazon are simply fluid transactions and top notch service.As for the TV itself, WOW is all I can say.  Out of the box, the color is simply stunning.  Not surprisingly, the first program that was watched on the TV was a Penguins pre-season game, and the TV itself took the game to a whole other level.  All movement (which is pretty fast in hockey) was very fluid and \"crisp\".  After the game, I wanted to take the 3D for a test drive, so HBO on-demand had Avatar 3D available.  Simply stunning.  I know some people like to knock the passive 3D technology, but to me, the 3D experience that comes from this TV is as good as any you will see in the theater.  The next test was with X-box, and once again, results were fantastic.All this being said, there are a few things about the TV that I do not like.  First, for better or worse, it's extremely thin.  While sleek and sexy in profile, this thinness does not bode well if mounting on a wall (as I have done).  I purchased a standard wall mount (Sanus) and after I hung the TV, I quickly realized that any inputs on the back of the TV are so tight to the wall that they are inaccessible.  I would recommend purchasing a wall mount that is somewhat telescopic if you plan on using component cables and hanging this TV on the wall.  My second complaint is about the wireless.  We have a 20 Mbps wireless network in our house, and when using the internet app on the TV, it seems we are on dial-up.  Third (and this could possibly be the product of my aging receiver) is the audio/visual sync when using 3D.  Fortunately LG put some functionality in the TV that allows the user to go in and manually \"adjust\" the visual so that it will sync up with the audio.  I've got the sync pretty close using this approach, but not perfect.Overall though, a simply stunning TV for the price.

Absolutely amazing. First movie I saw on this TV was Lion King and I wasn't disappointed. Other TV's just don't match to the quality of LG's 3D pictures. The glasses are simple plastic glasses like you get in the theaters and no need to charge like every other 3D TV. The 2D-3D conversion is outstanding. You can watch you favorite show or sport event and just turn this option on and you have 3D picture in nano seconds. If you're into 3D gaming. No other TV can bring the games to life like this one, I assure you. Truly, the best 3D TV in the market.Secondly, the Smart TV. While I am not as impressed with the web browser as I am with everything else, it's fairly well. The real \"smart\" in this TV really comes in the premium packets (i.e. Netflix, MLB.tv, Hulu Plus, etc.) and after a few software updates, these services (if you are a member to any) are absolutely mind blowing. Connecting to YouTube is easy, but I wish they would update the interface and add categories such as \"most viewed\" and \"most popular\"  and allow the user to sign in and rate, comment, and share. This would really make a difference to what it looks like now. I'm not all that obsessed with apps but LG has a large inventory of all kinds of apps.Now for the little details. The 120hz is more than enough to deliver picture perfect resolution in any type of programs may it be live sports, movies, shows, etc. Setting up the TV was fairly easy. I had a furniture stand ready for it, so it was a matter of just attaching the stand to it and lifting it on to the table. Once everything was connected it was good to go. Software updates are extremely important and require internet connection. Luckily the TV came with a USB internet connection to pick up on your router. That was easy to set up as well and took me seconds. The remote controls it comes with are phenomenal. The magic wand remote gives you more up-close and personal management over your TV.Bottom line: this TV left me with no regrets and I highly recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "lip sync issues with older A/V receivers", "Author": "Turbobuick86", "ReviewID": "R2GFVTM9O97NCZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm not going to discuss how gorgeous the picture is or how great the 3D is because they are both spectacular.Have had this TV for one week.

I'm not about to buy a new receiver that would compare to this one sound-wise just for the sake of synching the audio/video. If your happy with stereo then the optical out of the TV will provide digital stereo sound through the receiver in sync. My two previous TV's, both rear projection, had no sync issues with this same Yamaha receiver.

I've got my HD cable box connected via HDMI, with a TOSLINK running from the TV to my Onkyo receiver (which is why I did not rate the audio).

Even eventually went to look at a floor model in the store. I had been looking for a 50\"+ TV for around $1000.00 dollars and most everything in this price range would get me 50\"-55\" basic plasma or standard LCD HDTV. In order to get better LED or plasma with any additional feature (especially 3D) I was going to have to pay 1,500 or 1,800+ and I was even considering it. So when I saw this TV for around $1,200 dollars and I saw the quality of it in the store I jumped on it and I was more than willing to sacrifice the 3\" considering the quality for the price.I have got to say though I wasn't very interested in the other 3D technology out there because not only would I be paying for the TV but an additional $150 dollars per set of active 3D glasses which would also have to be charged and I was told were very fragile.

And the handsome transparent edging around the piano-black bezel is just a very welcome addition to this fine-looking TV.Right then and there I started getting 3D Blu-ray movies and have gotten quite a few since. They look breathtakingly beautiful, simply amazing! (You can always switch the 3D effect off if preferable and the 2D image is just as pristine.) Thought it couldn't get as good as at the theater? It definitely can, even better: at the movies, they can be a bit off-focus, here you see them cristal-clear; at the movies, they can be a bit dark, here the brightness, contrast, color, detail, etc etc are tip-top--I did have to get picture-setting recommendations online to improve this, but no biggy--; at the movies, they can get a bit too loud, here you just set up your home theater system to your liking! (One of the reasons for stepping up to 3D Blu-ray technology is that I had already bought a more-than-decent ONKYO HT-S5400 7.1 channel sound system since May 2011 that was crying for me to get a TV to go with it!) So, trust me, it does get better!!!And, all that active VS passive 3D talk is just nonsense. You cannot go wrong with passive. Go for a demo at a store and see for yourself. Read online comparisons and they give you so many reasons why you can't beat passive--it is so easy to get extra pairs of lightweight glasses in assorted sizes and styles, for one thing! (This would really hurt your economy if you were to need extra \"active\" ones.) Also, the viewing angle is wide enough both horizontally and vertically. Maybe the only hiccup is that you can't tilt this TV down on its base, only swivel it to the sides, but, then again, if the vertical viewing angle reasonably makes up for it, than this is not really a hiccup, right?I could go on and on about all the other features as others have, but, bottom line, if you like 3D and are reading this...get this TV!!!

(gives it a fake soap opera look) i seem to like it but if you dont then its simple \"Turn it OFF\"... some people talk about the screen \"bleeding\" and it does but its not a deal breaker for me.Second most important for me is \"Gaming\"I was close to not buying this tv because of the bad reviews it had when it came to gaming, well im happy to say that i have no idea what they where talking about... i have both an \"Xbox 360\" and a \"PS3\"... and our favorite game genre are \"FPS\"  and \"Fighting Games\"... i have to say that i have not experienced any lag, and i had my son and his friends play \"Black ops\" (by the way they are very good).. and they agree that it plays perfectly normal, even when its not in \"Game Mode\"... i did install the latest update and turned off the \"tru motion\" feature... so rest asuured that this tv will play nice with youre consoles.Third is the \"3D\"The 3D is amazing, my brother has an \"active 3D tv\" and he agrees that \"passive\" is the way to go!... now as far as the 3D effect, well that all depends on the content you play... see some movies where filmed with 3D cameras (which are the best looking 3D movies).. and others where just \"converted\" ... so do youre research before you purchase any 3d movies... here is my quick list of movies i recommend ( avatar, resident evil, kelly slater ultimate wave, despicable me, monsters vs aliens, coraline, rio, open season).. these seem to have more \"pop out\" effects than just a sense of 3D depth...The 2D to 3D conversion is pretty cool but its not quality 3d (you can convert anything on tv thou).. so overall it works.Fourth is \" Sound\"The sound is not amazing but it does what its suppose to do, if you want a kick ass sound, then i recommend you buy a \"surround sound\" or a \"sound bar\"... overall it works, so no complaints.Fifth is \"Design\"It looks like most TVs out there, the bezel is pretty thin, and what is more amazing is how \"Thin\" and \"light\" this tv is... very impressed... over all its a good looking tv.Sixth \"app/Smart tv function\"Let me say that this is no \"Google Tv\"... i was not impressed with the \"app store\" or the \"web browser\"... overall i decided to not even use it (maybe just for Netflix) aside from that i believe that this is the tv weakest feature, but then again thats why i have my two Game consoles for.Overall i am very happy with this tv, and i would recommend it to everyone,... you get \"High end\" features at \"Low end\" price.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG55LW5600  WOW", "Author": "wrdore", "ReviewID": "R4MPJWP69CZQM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am by no means an expert as to what makes the best LED Tv, however I do know compared to the 5yr. old 37\" TV I have this 55\" monster is remarkable.

It made the football games look like you were playing madden on playstation or something.  The 2d conversion really doesn't give you the \"pop out\" that most people like, but it adds a great depth to the picture which is cool.  Especially with movies that were released in 3d like for instance, the new Resident Evil moive.  I converted it to 3d from Starz and it looks great.

I found some edge lit LEDs but most without local dimming, which turns out to be a big factor in picture quality.  The cost of this TV from Vann's via Amazon was $1000 CHEAPER than Best Buy when I bought it a few weeks ago.  Also, the LG 5 year warranty is recommended, as the Best Buy warranty is twice as much for one year of less coverage.  Also, LG techs will go to your house in lieu of taking your TV down and taking it into Best Buy.  Along with no tax and free shipping, buying via Amazon is a no brainer. Set up was very easy and all of my devices hooked up with no problem.  For you gamers, once you update to the latest OTA update and play on \"GAME\" mode, the lag is nonexistent.  Even on Rockband/GH games the sync is perfect!  I also stream Netflix via the included wireless network adapter with no problems or buffering at all.  There are two USB ports which is a bonus, as the included network adapter uses a USB port.  I connect a 1TB HDD to the other USB port.The only little thing that is left to be desired is the sound, for a smaller room, it may be great for most, but my living room is rather large so the built in speakers are not all that great.  Adding a soundbar or component HT is a good idea for those with bigger rooms.  I bought the Vizio VHT215 via Amazon and couldn't be happier.  See my review on the Vizio soundbar is you are interested in a soundbar as your speaker solution.The reason why I did not want a 3D TV in the first place is that I heard/read that some TVs do HD good but 3D terribly and vice versa.  After reading reviews and finally seeing it in my own living room, this set does both MAGNIFICENTLY!  3D has great pop for a passive system and the glasses are very inexpensive in contrast to active shutter glasses.

Obviously it doesn't have the same resolution while using 3D as an Active 3D TV would, but really, thats fine. Considering the glasses are about 8 times cheaper (Free if you keep them from 3D movies at the movie theater), don't need batteries, and they're lighter; I think it's safe to say they are better than active glasses.

The set was decent other than that.  When debating what to exchange it for (Amazon was out of the D6000) I debated long and hard between this set and the Toshiba TL515. After having this one for a couple days I'm pleased with my decision.  I like the picture on this set even better than my D6000.As for this set - it has a really nice bright picture.  Very clean and crisp.  It does have a matte screen, which you can see in some shots gives it a slightly less crisp appearance, but I find that on the other hand, it creates a much less reflective picture than the glossy screens.  It also, to me, gives it a more life like picture and adds some texture to the image.The web browsing functions are decent, but not outstanding.  Even with the magic motion remote (which IS very cool), it's a bit cumbersome to scroll through things, especially when my laptop is right in front of me.  Aside from streaming, I can't see myself using the feature much.  On the other hand, I did download a new software update very quickly, which was nice.As for the 3D, I don't have a 3D blu-ray, but I did use the 2d-3d conversion feature, which is pretty neat.  It's not real 3d but it does give the image some cool depth.  I can't imagine doing it a ton though.  I wasn't really in the market for 3d, but figured for the same price, why not.Another couple of neat little things - the TV has a touch bezel, which doesn't do a ton for you, but it's pretty cool. Also, the bezel is nice looking, a bit bulkier than I'd like but it's not bad.  The samsung had a nicer pedestal and bezel, but it's such a minor thing that I doubt I'll think about it again after writing this.Another random note for buyers - I watch a ton of sports and at first there was a lot of judder and pixelation around fast moving items (like the ball or legs running).  I turned off the trumotion feature and it seems to have corrected the issue.  There is very occasional mild distortion on really fast motion, but I doubt there's a TV out there that won't give you any of that what so ever.

I bought the LG clip on 3d glasses available here on Amazon.  One other great feature of this set is the content that is playable on USB.  I have a lot of movies, TV shows in different formats on external hard drives and USB sticks.  There are 2 USB ports that accomodate these.  Most formats play flawlessly.  I no longer need my Western Digital media player.  My new latest addition to this set is the Logitech Revue with Google TV.  (see my revue on that item).  That product works as a remote for this set.  I'm also typing this on the revue keyboard and watching TV on the set using picture in picture.

For the first few days, the main menu and sub-menus were not so easy to learn and use. We had menu difficulty mainly because the sparse manual that was provided with it, because it mainly shows mechanical and connection details of the TV, and is very short in detail about the display menus, with no pictures of the displayed menus, nor any kind of printed roadmap (like a block flow chart) to find and get thru and use the many sub-menus. It took a lot of tries experimenting to even find many of the lower menus (kinda like Dungeons and Dragons) and we suspect there are even more to find as of now, (30 days later). When we finally found several of them, we were pleased with many of the available control options. But wait, there are more to be found.. We use external audio speakers to improve the audio, and find that several of the audio setup menus are disabled when we connect them. We enjoy the simple remote BlueTooth control with the on-screen cursor, it works as described in the simple printed manual,(less setup the BlueTooth link).  It easily controls the signal input selections, channels, sounds, and some basic display window settings, however it does not reach into the multiple sub-menus available thru the main remote control. We wanted to use the WiFi wireless link to our home Wireless router, and found it does setup ok, (you have to use the TVs embedded wireless menu to do it). > In summary, be prepared to do a lot of tries via different menu routes to find and use all the control menus embedded in the setup screens.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fabulous and surprising in 3D...but hate lack of audio out", "Author": "Matenai", "ReviewID": "R2HO1VV1WRX9OI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have nothing to add to the rest of the praise...this is one amazing TV it has all the features.One big problem with this as well as all LGs and many other brands that has surprised over a million people is that there is no audio output to go to a stereo or hearing impaired device needed in my case for my parents. There is an optical output that can be used. But you cannot use a normal DAC converter because the optical output is Dolby. This means you need to spend another $90 and buy this device: [...]Do not try other converters as they will not work unless they DECODE THE DOLBY 5.1 SIGNAL FROM THE OPTICAL OUTPUT TO RCA STEREO PLUGS. Your other option is to buy a home theater system and use it's outputs if they exist.This TV does have an earphone output which is a step up since last models but it will disable all audio functions if used. So you can only hear from the optical or the earphones and not both. One error in the manual is that the optical output is still active with the the audio option for the speakers to be on. The manual says you have to turn off the speakers to get optical audio. Not true.I spent over 20 hours trying to solve this problem and others have done the same. The Gefin unit works real easy. Make sure you order an optical cable to use it. Also, one tip as I have never used optical cables and could not get these to work. You must remove the little cover from the ends of the cable before plugging in. On the Amazon cables they look like they are part of the assembly and they do not pull off without extreme tugging. What you should see is a metal rod and the end is where the light comes out.

I didn't care about the 3D, but it's a nice plus. It's hard to find a quality LED LCD TV these days that doesn't at least have passive 3D.2D picture quality is excellent. Nearly every aspect of the TV is customizable, with easy to use menus. The TV comes with two remotes, a full featured standard remote with 4 arrow buttons for navigation, and a wii-type point and click wand remote that is really excellent at menu navigation. The wand overlays a cross on the screen that can be placed on any clickable object. All remotes should have this feature.I tried the 2D to 3D conversion. It works, but to me it seems like a gimmick. The original 2D picture was tack sharp, and there was a clear loss of quality when the image was converted to 3D. However, the 3D definitely added a nice element of depth. I haven't tried a real 3D disk yet. The 3D LG app has a few streamed videos for sample purposes, but they were nothing special.I would have liked rca outputs for my old speakers, but was able to use them with a mini-jack to rca conversion cable, connected to the headphone jack on the TV.The field of view is excellent. The swivel on the included stand works well, making sure that everyone in the room has a good view.The smart tv feature is a disappointment. You can access YouTube, but the interface is practically non-existent. When you select YouTube from the menu a random video begins to play. Accessing the screen keyboard is cumbersome and the wand, while better than hunting for letters with the 4 arrow buttons on the standard remote, is not as good as a real keyboard. A lot of YouTube videos are not available. The smart tv has a web browser, but doesn't support the current version of Flash, so you can't watch video over YouTube on the web. The free version of Hulu doesn't work either.The smart tv feature can access files on your PC, with included media server software. But Macs or IOS devices are not supported.I was hoping to watch podcasts, but the built in podcast app - Howcast, has not been updated for 45 days.Update: If you download the free media player/server Plex you'll be able to access videos and pictures from your Mac. Your iTunes library will play only if its mp3. AAC is not supported. Also Plex has some great apps. Much better than LG's smart tv apps.Overall I'm happy with the purchase.

Once in a while still see blur during sport actions, but got mostly clear actions.2.  Using HDMI ARC (Audio Return Channel) feature to play Dolby Digital audio through a audio receiver is great during football games.3.  So far only watch two 3D movies (The latest Harry Potter (Best Buy exclusive) and the latest Narnia (got it free with Sony Blu-ray player)).  Those two movies showed 3D depths but nothing really pops out.  Although the 3D quality is really good, kids were kind of disappointed that nothing really pops out.  Based on other reviews, I guess the pops out effects are dependent on the movies and I just need to get the right one.4.  Watching Netflix is not as smooth as I like.  May be the included dongle's Wi-Fi connection speed is not good enough.  Kind of disappointed.  I ended up still watching Netflix using my Sony Blu-ray player.5.  Like others, I do not like the energy saving feature.  Too dark.  I turned off the energy saving feature and use Vivid mode to get to the brightness level that I like.6.  When in the home screen, I keep seeing the message that the TV is updating software, seems to be endlessly updating. I wonder what were being updated...7.  Playing Xbox 360 games are fine so far.  Tested Forza Motorsport 4 and Dance Central 2.  Both showed clear video quality and no blur at all.8.

This was the second TV that we had to have delievered  since the first LG had serious back light bleeding in the corners - so much so that even our young son noticed it and commented on it.  The second TV is much better although there is still some bleeding visible when its switched on initially  I assume this is an issue with most LCD tv's).  However when the TV actually switches on (ie goes from the start up screen to the screen saver page (if your inputs eg cable box are off), then the issue goes away completely.  And when the Tv goes to a picture (when you switch on your source) the picture is amazing.It's just the right size for our room (19 x 15) and we've mounted it onto a stand (rather than the wall) as it's in a corner.  It looks good with it's black surround and matt screen.  Even though our previous RPTV was working just fine, the reflections on the screen from all the windows (even with the blinds shut) meant we couldn't watch TV during the day - the picture was washed out completely.  Since we changed to the LG, the matt screen means that we can now watch TV during the day - so much so that we don't notice any reflections now at all.  If you have a very bright room, a matt screen is the way to go (i think the Matt screens looks better than shiny ones anyways).The colours are vibrant and clear and the picture is great (although i did have to tweak the settings in the menu in order to get a better picture). Some say the speakers are useless but we've found them perfectly adequate for day-to-day viewing.  If you want surround sound then obviously you'll want to add a received and separate speakers.  But as a regular family room Tv, they are fine.One of the stated problems with LCD screens is the so called 'motion blur'.  We haven't noticed any such blur at all (- I do notice blur and have noticed it at my brother's house on his other brand TV).Connection to the internet was easy and the Tv automatically upgraded to the newest software version.  I can't comment on the wifi connection as we are using ethernet which is a much better option if you can go that route.  The 'home' page could be better laid out.  The LG apps are cool but gimmicky - such as a 3D kids one which lets you try out 3D - which itself is a bit gimmicky.  The other apps (youtube, netflix etc) do their job OK and you can download a few more if you want.All in all - we are very happy with the TV and recommend it.BTW - great return policy and service  from Amazon - I wish all companies would take a leaf out of Amazon's book on return policies.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "The best 3D tv out there!", "Author": "U.

It has every feature I want in a TV.  Full HD 1080p, although that's pretty much the standard, now.  Network and internet connectivity through LAN or WiFi, including it's own apps for netflix, YouTube, amazon, hulu, and more. Use it as a uPnP device and play movies from your computer. Passive 3D with four pairs of glasses and support for several 3D modes.  I bet those old movie theater glasses I have might work.  Look at photos and videos from your phone or other wireless device with DLNA on the tv. LED edge lit with local dimming is pretty cool.  I have a lamp a few feet away from the screen and I can tell that one part of the screen is a bit lighter than another when I move it.3D using passive technology is awesome.  It supports all the common modes and you don't have to worry about headaches from flashing/shutter tech.  I wouldn't suggest it for 3D gaming.  There is a bit of input lag even without 3D enabled, and it increases when you enable it.  You can assign a PC input label to reduce the lag which makes games playable without the 3D effect.  There are a couple 3rd party alternatives that support the native 3D mode of this television like iz3d and tridef.  Like others have said, the TV must be at eye level for 3D viewing, otherwise you get ghosting/double image.  With a 47\" TV, you will probably be in a chair or on a couch, so it shouldn't be a big deal.I probably won't ever use the Magic motion controller since I already have a PC hooked up to the computer and can browse the internet through it.  But if you want to sit on the couch and pretend this TV is an internet-Wii, you can.A big plus about this TV is that a lot of people have it, or a similar version.  There is plenty of information on the net about any problems that may be encountered for what I would call \"power users.\"  There is also plenty of calibration info on the net done by professionals with expensive equipment that the average user wouldn't buy or use.  Also, LG has updated the firmware at least twice since I bought it, adding an enhanced 3D mode that is supposed to combat the shortcomings of passive 3D, which is halving the vertical resolution of the content.While I have enjoyed this TV as my PC screen and TV, there have been a couple issues.  A few weeks ago I found my eyes hurting for some reason.  I wasn't watching 3D content, and I don't know what it was.  I increased the back-light and possibly by coincidence, they no longer hurt.  I also notice some weird flickering in the upper left corner of the screen sometimes.  If I move a particular window on my PC away from the corner, it stops flickering.The sound is not very good coming from the tv, but acceptable and capable of being loud if needed. It can sound kind of like a tunnel, or like it's being obstructed by something. It has a setting called ClearVoice that increases the voices during programming, and infinite surround for emulating surround sound. It does have support for ARC, and Audio Video Sync settings in case there is a sync issue.  It also has different settings for whether you use a stand or wall mount the TV.  I think the speakers may be facing backwards or down, but I don't know.  Usually you will see holes on the front of the tv.  Maybe if it had some the quality would be a bit better.  It's possible that thy are facing the speakers backwards for use with the infinite surround feature to get some sort of environment sound space.Overall I love my TV.

The shipping was pretty fast, and it arrived without any damage. It was a little annoying to set up as the base has 2 pieces, and you have to put them together with the tv in the the right order or it won't work. Eventually we figured it out, but there was a bit of a give to it, it wasn't completely stable, it could turn, but it didn't feel like it should. Truthfully, I don't really use all of the apps as I have a laptop, but I'm sure they're cool. The TV is beautiful, I love the glossy black finish, and it's crazy thin, though it does have some weight to it. The best thing though, of course, has to be the picture quality, which is absolutely amazing. All of the HD programs look much better than my old 42 inch 720p Plasma TV. I have no complaints here.Regarding the 3D, it isn't really enough to buy this TV specifically, but it is a great additional feature. I like the theater 3d much better than the active 3D, which bothered my eyes when I tried it. It does add a really cool extra dimension in any 3D movies/shows you can find, but sometimes it is a little lacking, especially with 3D sports. However, with other programs the 3D is absolutely crazy, so I think it may depend on the program, perhaps not exactly the TV.I'll be sure to update this review if anything changes, but I absolutely love this TV, especially at the price I got it.", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Super duper deluxe!", "Author": "Ira & Linda Bass", "ReviewID": "R1W6CQ715JV3XV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm blown away.

As it turns out, the set is pretty light.Installation is a breeze.Place the stand on the back, screw.That's it.Wiring: easy. HDMI from TV to Bluray player. Power cord.In all, it took less than 10 minutes for those two steps, and that includes the wiring of speakers to the amplifier that we bought along this TV.Unless you want to mess with the default set up, there is very little you need to do, you turn on the TV and the TV pretty much takes it from there.We watched regular cable and were are satisfied with the quality of the picture. When you flip channels, there is only a very short waiting time before the switch happens.We purchased the LG player that was featured as an offer. The players responds quickly.We also purchased Tangled, Polar Express and Alice in Wonderland.One concern of ours involved the glasses, since we have 2 kids. We did not want glasses that are too heavy - do keep in mind we do not allow the kids to watch TV that often- nor so expensive that we would be upset if the kids broke them.this time has the best solution: The glasses that are needed are extremely light, perfect for our little people.think about those cheap glasses that you get from the movie theater. Yep, those are the ones, we tried, they work.Amazon frequently offers very interesting promotions (buy this, get 4 pairs)Watching Tangled was amazing, just like a theater moment. It is truly impressive to have so much power coming out of that TV. Amazing.We did watch Alice in Wonderland too. The original movie is fun but the 3D gives such an extra layer of fun.We also tried the fake 3D. It is not bad at all!the TV pretty much tries to add 3D effects. We tried this on a Harry Potter DVD and the effects were really cool.Last but not least.

The manual covers 36 LG models. This model does not have its own section; it is intermixed with all of the other models. For example, for \"component connection\", you have to go through the various connections for listed models then when you don't find this model; you are supposed to assume that it is the illustration labeled as \"other\". This is true throughout the manual. The wall mount illustration is applicable to 21 other models and they use most of the space telling you what models they are, while the actual detailed illustration is only a \u00bd inch by \u00bd inch, and requires a magnifying glass to see it.

The picture quality is excellent, the SmartTv features are pretty cool, the 3D is a nice surprise, and the slim profile makes the TV look awesome.Picture Quality:I did a lot of research on this TV before I pulled the trigger and ordered one. I read some people mentioning \"artifacts\" or \"blooming\" in the picture. I have seen some bleed through (my own description) of the LED backlighting along the edge of the picture with a super dark black image on the screen. The only time I've seen this is when the TV is on some kind of menu or booting up and the screen is supposed to be totally black. I've never seen it with a program (TV or movie), even in the darkest of scenes. Overall, the picture is very crisp, the colors are great and vibrant, and I think the 120Hz definitely helps with the sports.SmartTV:I was expecting more from LG with the SmartTV. Especially watching some reviews on Amazon, Newegg, CNET, etc, I thought this interface would be pretty awesome. It works, but it's definitely not awesome. The Netflix streaming software is barebones, not all that intuitive, and just kinda boring. There was an ad on Amazon's page for this TV saying that you can stream lots of programming from their new On Demand Video service onto this TV, which is true, but there's not much stuff on their database yet, and it's pretty hard to find your way through it. The motion remote is pretty cool. I think this is a pretty cool feature for the first week or two, but I have a feeling the novelty will wear out pretty quickly. All the apps, especially the LG Apps, it seems, are just kinda minimalist and don't have much functionality.3D:Let's preface this by saying that I have not seen 3D programming or watched a Blu-Ray that was 3D encoded. The only 3D I can comment on was the 2D->3D upconversion. The upconversion is pretty cool. It was definitely a nice surprise. It will convert pretty much anything into 3D. It works pretty well with sports and movies. I didn't buy this TV because it was 3D, and the 3D isn't that important to me, but it is a pretty cool feature to maybe watch Transformers or Star Wars or something in 3D every once in a while. *Update: I have seen some 3d programming now and it is great. Watching Avatar on 3D Blu-Ray was out of this world. I felt like I was at the 3D theatre. The disks are about $40-50 each though, so I guess I'll stick to renting. Great picture quality though.The TV was really easy to set up, right out of the box, and the slim profile is really cool. The sound quality is not very good because it's such a small volume to cram speakers into. I have a pair of the $80 Bose computer speakers plugged into the headphone jack and they make the sound 10X better.Overall, I'd buy this TV again for the great picture quality and the slim profile, but not so much for the SmartTV or the motion remote.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Magnificent HDTV", "Author": "MWT4791", "ReviewID": "R17IBLAMOE3B1C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received the LG55LW5600 on Tuesday of this week.

The picture was excellent and the 3d depth and POP OUT was what really sold me.

It has more capability, uses less power, and has 3D capability to boot. It's also not the most expensive TV. Older sets cost more during their time, but none delivered anywhere near the features contained in this set.The set has a very robust base, compared to skimpier bases on other sets. I know many like to mount sets to walls, but if you don't this has a great strong stand that will easily swivel the set left and right (but not up or down).Viewing angle is very good, and color retention at high angles is decent. In a very well lit room with many windows during strong daylight the picture is still easily visible.LG provides a number of applications, including a 3D streaming channel. These are free. Netflix, Huluplus, Amazon, Youtube and most of the staples of internet streaming are supported. As are games, books, even news, entertainment and children's media content.A web browser is included, it was able to display complex pages, manage secure login, and render relatively advanced pages (including pages with flash player) very well (though it was a bit poky compared to my desktop PC).The screen is very well done, built in speakers are as one would expect not the greatest, but are consistent with other similar sets.Weight and thickness are amazing, this set weighs less than one of my old 42\" LCD's.3D HDMI worked with my DirecTV box, and I was able to play the 2 free channels DirecTV currently provides for 3D viewing.As it's passive, there is a resolution hit which is noticeable when looking at some fine detail during sporting events. The compensation is 3D perspectives on those events. Watching a football game, and switching from 2D to 3D there was a noticeable loss of resolution of player details at distance. However the advantage of having 3D perspective more than makes up for that loss in my opinion.My pre-purchase concern was how bad passive would be compared to active, a friend has an active set, and it wasn't fun to watch for a long period in 3D. There may have been issues of the weight of the glasses, maybe sync wasn't quite correct, or perhaps the battery was not full. Whatever the reason for the active 3D causing eye fatigue, my choice was to try a passive 3D set.So far this is a winner for my family. Everyone likes it. Even in 2D pictures are crisp. The set has some sound configuration options that inhibit some commercials from being much louder than the non-commercial part of a program.There are two remote controls provided, one is a standard remote, similar to that with any other set. The other is a wand remote that at first seems very unimpressive. The wand functions similarly (but is overall inferior to) a Wii remote control. To active the user clicks once, and gets a target displayed on the screen, then in most situations the wand can be moved left / right / up / down and the user can hit enter when the target is over the button they want. This works for most data entry.It's not perfect, but it's a darn nice TV.Without doubt, in 6 months this set will be obsolete, but so far we are very pleased with our purchase.

I, so far, have been proven wrong about that. The picture is excellent any way you look at it.Now, I'm not a big gamer. I'm too old for that (although I do own both an Xbox with Kinect and a Wii). So I can't verify the issues other reviewers stated about the slower refresh rate causing their video to lag while playing. As of yet, I saw no lag in anything I viewed to date. I truly believe that unless you are going to be one of those ultimately picky people that I have come across in other reviews, whether you choose to purchase this TV with the 120 hz rate of the 240, I feel you will enjoy the picture either way.One comparison I have between my Samsung 47\" and the LG 55\" is that it seems with all the reviews of these TV's, people are complaining about the light LED bleeding especially from the corners. I saw that very sugnificantly with the Samsung. But, I have to say with my experience of owning this TV in the last week, there is no such bleeding to speak of. The upper left corner seems to display a slightly lighter glow than the other three but nothing to really be annoyed about. After watching the movie \"Cowboys + Aliens\" last night, I was awe struck by the clarity of the picture and the true to life colors. No, it wasn't a blu ray copy, just the standard DVD copy and it was still awesome. I felt as if I could walk right into the screen and be part of the movie. With my theatre sound and that picture, I felt as if I was back at the theatre watching it for a second time. Oh, and it was also not in 3D mode either.I am not sure I am all that big on the local dimming option either because I was a little annoyed that when the scene went dark, and I had the room dark with just the christmas tree lights on, the picture would darken. Then when some sort of lighting would appear on screen, the picture would lighten back up to normal. I thought this was odd as to me, shouldn't the picture, in a brighter setting then become dim instead of brighter? I don't know maybe I was seeing it incorrectly, not sure.As other reviewers have commented about the 3D for this television, in a way I do find it kind of gimmicky, (if that is a word). But, that too, is still a very awesome feature for home theatre. By gimmicky, I found that while using the 3D mode during regular television viewing, if the frame of actors was still with not much movement, then the picture appeared 2D. But once the scene got more active and there was more background motion, then one can very much so see the depth of 3D. I also noticed that when viewing a program in true HD, if in 3D mode, the sharper the picture, the more the 3D depth stands out. Now, movies and videos that are shot in 3D are awesome! I have TRON Legacy in 3D. With the purchase of this TV I also purchased an LG 3D blu ray player. It was so awesome being able to view that movie feeling as if I was at the theatre watching it for the second time in 3D. It is so cool also, with the passive 3D, one can view movies and shows in 3D without worrying about a second box or if the batteries are going to die. You just put the glasses on when switched to 3D mode and totally enjoy!The LG apps are ok. There could be more. One reviewer totally put down the Netflix app. I found nothing wrong with it. It loaded my shows just fine and I actually watched and episode of \"The Munsters\" in 3D. Very cool. I dowloaded the 3D Zone app. It's a cool app if you want something to give you the feel of what your 3D watching experience should be like. The videos are streamed over the internet connection and since my wireless seems a bit hoaky at times where it is located, I had to wait for each 30 second set of video to keep downloading. I also didn't like the way the producers of these 3D vidoes felt it necessary to combine the logos for the videos with actual moving background videos. The whole experience was very annoying for me to watch with all that misplaced movement going on. Once you get passed the logos and the actual video begins to play, then it's pretty cool to watch in 3D.My whole experience with the product at this point is in one word \"Awesome\"! Unless some failure happens with it or I notice other anomolies, I would definitely recommend this product to others. It's a very fun and enjoyable home theatre experience. Reviewers are mentioning how the TV cuts the resolution in half for each eye so you still get the 1080P HD picture. Well all that is way too techincal for this reviewer to worry about. All I know, from my experience the last few days, this product, whether in 3D or not, gives a very sharp, clear, wathable picture. It has a whole suite of picture setting options, some even I don't understand what they do.Oh, and I also find the magic remote quite useful. I prefer using it with the pointer on the screen as a \"one click and point\" button solution over trying to go through the menu options and trying to find all the right keys on the regular remote, especially if you can't see them in the dark. It's so much easier to use than the standard remote control. So, for me, the magic remote is a huge plus!The only drawback I found annoying, as others have mentioned, the speakers for these thin tv's have a bit to be desired. But what can one expect. I felt that once you adjust all the sound options, you can get some pretty good sound out of the built in speakers so again that function isn't even too bad. But, I want to be able to add my first sub-woofer for added bass during regular TV viewing, without having to run it through the stereo reciever where a second sub-woofer is already connected. The only option I could find on the back for an external audio out connection was the headphone jack. I tried plugging my sub-woofer into that jack but because it is labeled as a headphone jack, the tv \"smartly\" disables the on-board speakers and doesn't offer the user the option to do so his or herself. The TV warns you that you have plugged something into the headphone jack and the the speakers turn off. Then I can get some bass through my sub-woofer but now without any sound from the TV. Hmmmmm.... The Samsung at least had not a headphone jack but a labeled audio out jack and didn't disable the internal speakers unless you opted to do so through the options screen. So, now I have to research another way to get sound to my first sub-woofer without the need to turn go through my stereo receiver first.I also noticed people were complaining about the digital fibre optic output and that it didn't pass through the 5.1 audio. I haven't hooked anything up to that yet so I am not going to review or comment further unless I do.All In all, I think the TV so far is awesome and I do say go out and order it or buy it if you have the cash!!!!Update, 1.5 months after purchase....I still go with all the above except now I have tried the 5.1 optical output. I tried playing some dvd video files with 5.1 surroumd sound still encoded and the sound was produced just as it was with the original movies through all 5 speakers. I found that to be awesome!I also don't see where people FREAK out about the saying the resolution is being cut in half when viewing 3D. What exactly do you people feel your eyes are actually capable of detecting when watching television? Geez!! I felt when veiwing 3D, the picture looks every bit as sharp and clear as it did when viewing 2D. Maybe I'm not as picky as some of you but when you expect something more than your own eyes are able to detect in the first place, that is going too far in my book! Just watch it and enjoy!I personally love this television and I personally NOT going to wait a year for some other technology to come out. As far as I am concerned, the next technology will have to be when they make the images holographic and appear in the middle of my living room or viewing area without using any glasses or wearing anything extra for veiwing what-so-ever. Until they master that feet, I'm pretty satisfied with what I have now. Just hope it doesn't blow up on me in the next 5 years or so! :-)", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bang for the buck 3D TV", "Author": "SunJunkie", "ReviewID": "R314WX2CYD8UE2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I brought this TV to replace a portable TV that I had for my bed room. Its been about 45 days and I am definitely impressed with LG 47LW5600. This model packs in a bundle of features that are very handy.  4 HDMI inputs, 2 USB ports, Ethernet connection, PC VGA slot, pc audio and auxiliary audio connections are  in a compact connection module in the back panel. The TV is wafer thin compared to LCD and Plasmas, obviously being an LED.The initial assembly and setup took about 15 min. This TV comes with 2 remote controls one of them is the handy Wii-type controller, to do on-screen selections. It is quite responsive and makes it convenient to browse around in the TV GUI. LG AppStore integrates various applications and the total \"Smart TV\" experience is amazing with all the tools built in. LG and Samsung go head to head on every tiny detail, and have carved quite a niche in the 3D LED realm.This TV renders passive 3D. I have connected various devices, and did some 3D gaming as well thru my PS3. Totally amazing quality, no noticeable lag, and amazing 2D-3D conversion. Yes, this TV converts 2D content to 3D so that you dont have to consistently switch or look at glared images when you take your passive3D lens off. Again, not much should be expected off of this feature, just a factor of convenience.I am a big energy-buff so I tested this TV for heat emission, energy consumption and few other factors. LG wins out big in this area. The TV automatically adjusts its temperature to the ambient room temp, lighting etc. Analogously the energy settings get altered. A good leap towards conserving your carbon footprint and cost savings.  If you are not happy with the adjustments that the TV makes, and want the rich bright shiny picture to be delivered in the highest and crispest quality, you can manually over-ride the TV's adjustment settings, thru the quick menu setup.The only negative that I can think of in this TV is the delivery of \"bass\" in audio. My other TV is a Panasonic Plasma 50\" and compared to that TV, the audio on this TV is not that great. We have to remember that this is the case with most of the wafer thin LED TVs. Thinner TVs cannot (yet) accommodate for good woofers within, hence relatively lack the \"bass\" quality. So I cant hold it against this particular TV or model.Highly recommended unit.

Yes, passive 3D does essentially halve the resolution, but the image is still very nice especially if you are viewing from more than 6 feet away.  On 3D bluray's the image is still very clear and crisp.  On lower resolution content such as that from Directv or streaming on the internet, the lower resolution is noticeable but in my opinion its still good and the 3D effect is great.  I have 4 children and I would be a nervous wreck if they were each running around with $100+ LCD glasses, plus I would have to spend over $500 to get 6 pair.  I just ordered 10 pair of RealD glasses for under 10 bucks total and they work great with this TV.  Now if the kids break a pair its no big deal.The glasses are so light that I don't even notice them.  When you look around the room there is no flicker and everything is just tinted a bit darker than with no glasses at all.  Another big plus is that you can get 3D polarized clip-on glasses which is very nice for people already wearing glasses.Ghosting is eliminated too since each eye sees a different image the entire time rather than rapidly switching back and forth like the LCD glasses.Active LCD glasses 3dtv will give you a sharper image than this passive set, but for me the pros outweigh the cons by a mile.Pros:No headaches,No eyestrain,No ghosting,Cheap glasses,Clip-on glasses,No flickering,No dead batteries in the middle of a movie,Cons:Lower resolution than Active 3D but only noticeable for me if you sit close", "Date": "June 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "this needs the bigger LSW400BG mount", "Author": "D.

LG offers a one year warranty on the tv.  I used it as a guest room television only and probably watched television on it 2 days out of the week.  And, one day, I turned it on and the red light came on and started flashing.  Then after about 10 seconds, the blue light came on indicating it was turned on, but the screen was BLACK and there was no sound!I called LG and they told me the television was out of warranty.  I purchased it with my american express card.  Considering american express warranties items up to 1 year after the expiration of the original warranty, let's hope that they will approve my request for repair.If you do buy this television, buy an extended warranty!  Shame on LG for selling something so beautiful that only lasts for a few years.  I have a sharp 60hz television for which I owned for 8 years and there's no sign of it failing.But, on to the review!  The resolution is perfect; 3d gaming (ps3) is awesome and I wish it would have come with 5 sets of glasses instead of just 4.The sound is lousy, but perfect if you connect a stereo system to it.There are plenty of connections; I have 4 hdmi and a mini-component connection.Everything High Def looked great on it.  Standard was no so great. But, that's to be expected.The online capabilities is via a wireless network card you plug into the usb port on the side, rear of the television.  Coupled with your wireless router, you have youtube (which lacks a search by DATE option).  You have LG videos, which is pretty cool, for some unheard of movies.But, the BEST feature is if you download MKV videos like me, you can PLAY THEM on this television!  My ps3 doesn't even play mkv files; but this television does!  And, if you download an MKV files that has a SRT file, you can use the close captioning.UPDATE!!!!-------------------------------I contacted LG and even though the television was out of warranty, they had me to scan and email a copy of my receipt and they sent a technician out to my home to repair the television.  It turns out it was the power supply and some board. I am now extremely happy.  LG did not have to do that, but they did!

The picture quality (particularly 3D) was terrific for the price point on LED-LCD models of this size.

So that's a very expensive 12-month rental. The TV turns on, but gets stuck at the \"LG, Life's Good\" logo.  None of the TV buttons or remote control buttons work, except the on/off buttons.At this point. LG is not honoring its warranty -- LG says the warranty expires one year after the order date, even though the TV didn't ship until Dec. 27 and didn't arrive until Dec. 30.  I don't see how an online retailer can try to use the order date for warranty claims since they still have the TV in their possession at that time.  I tried Amazon, but they have not been helpful either in getting LG to honor it's warranty.  I'm very disappointed in both LG and Amazon -- I'll update this review if LG agrees to fix the TV.

I shopped around A LOT before I purchased this LG TV, and it turned out pretty good so far with a few things I don't like much. I compared Sony, Samsung, LG, and Vizio before my purchase for the features I wanted: 3D, Smart TV, super thin (approximately 1\"), Internet connectivity, price range between $1000 to $1500. I dropped Vizio because their TVs don't look as good as the other three brands (thicker, bulkier edge, etc). If price weighs more to you, then I would recommend LG! If you prefer better reputable TVs, then Samsung/Sony may be your choice.Love:1. So easy to connect to Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, Vudu, HULU, and other apps with just one click from the remote controls. I find the other LG apps are somewhat useless because I never used them and they are very slow too. But watching Netflix, Amazon, Vudu, and Hulu Plus are perfect!2. Great images and colors!3. Super thin TV is a huge plus!4. Swivel stand that allows me to easily plug/unplug the cables.5. The Magic remote control that works like a Wii control that has a cursor on the TV screen. There are two remote controls with the TV. Easy to maneuver around the TV screen without moving the up/bottom/left/right buttons. The Magic control doesn't work as well/concise as the Wii control though.6. Price is lower comparing to Sony and Samsung. I paid less for this LG TV for comparable TVs from Sony/Samsung. Not sure if Sony/Samsung have better TVs, but I thought nowadays big-name TV manufacturers are just as good.7. Save money on 3D glasses. You can watch 3D on this TV using the 3D glasses from the theater! This is especially good for big families. No active 3D glasses needed, no need to re-charge. Active 3D glasses are sorta expensive. Anyhow, I heard active 3D is a bit better than passive 3D?? I can't tell much when I compared them at Best Buy, so passive glasses works for me since I can't tell the difference!8. The regular control has a back-lit button for night use! Also there is a button for energy saving on the regular control! I don't like bright TV screen at night and I can just use energy saving button to dim the TV screen! Totally love these two little things on the control.Dislikes:1. Wireless internet is TOO miserable that don't even think to depend on it! I have very fast internet service and also bought a second router right next to the TV, yet wireless USB that came with the TV is completely USELESS. I have to plug the Ethernet cable all the time in order to watch Netflix without interruption. This really disappoints because I don't like the cable sitting on the floor looking messy.2. No HDMI output - really sucks when I wanted to connect TV to my receiver via HDMI. There are 4 HDMI inputs on the TV, but no HDMI output at all. Problem solving is to buy an optical cable to connect to receiver to produce sound via home theater system.3. Sound sucks, period. But no surprise for such a thin TV because the speakers are usually not good. I doubt Sony/Samsung would have better sound. This is not a problem for me because of the home theater system speakers. You can get a sound bar if you don't have a system already.4. 2D to 3D conversion sorta sucks! The images don't pop out like the ones you see in theaters! LG only produces a perception of depth and calls it 3D? I like the images pop out, not the other way around.5. LG's processors are too slow for internet connection!! I tested using Facebook app and watched YouTube on the TV directly, hopeless! Doesn't make sense to do this on the TV cuz it is just too low! So the smart TV serves better for streaming thru i.e. Netflix.I would recommend you go to Best Buy to take a physical look at this TV if you want to purchase it online. Best Buy charged *a lot* more for this TV last time I checked, FYI. Overall, I still love this TV and decided to keep it even with some flaws. LG released a newer version of this TV shortly after I bought mine. The newer version looks nicer with the aluminum modern look! I checked out the newer version, and there is still no HDMI output!If you want everything in one set with some technological advance features, then this TV works!  Last word for those who want to buy a smart TV: as an alternative, you can just buy a regular TV for way LESS, then buy a HD Roku to stream online contents that has better wireless!

The LG customer service department admits that this is a problem with this model and that they cannot do anything to fix it. They will only give you an apology, nothing else.

I originally ignored the LG because the crummy plastic glasses just didn't look like they could do the trick, but after trying the shutter glasses... I wasn't impressed at all.My girlfriend got me to look at this LG's demo of a fish.  My god, it blew me away! The TV at that store was over 2000, on Amazon it was nearly half the price so I bought it the next day.In video games like Shadow of the Colossus this TV has looked absolutely dazzling.  It's strange to say it this way, but the 3d effect makes it feel like it's a step above high definition.The only movie I've watched so far is Tekken Vengeance (part of Tekken Hybrid) and that absolutely blew me away too.I hate to say, it's the future, so more and more things will start being in 3d.  This is an affordable option with all the bells and whistles.  For those who are opposed to 3d in general one thing I've noticed is that once you watch something for a while with the glasses on it becomes very natural and I've yet to experience a headache or anything (as I have with shutter glasses).I definitely recommend this TV, and the newer model of it has even more neat features worth considering!And one final note - if you buy this TV through Amazon - their customer service is incredible.

Kevin Nicholls and the other first few most helpful reviews already said most of what I would anyway so I'll just add a couple of things.First of all, if you have a smart phone get the LG Remote App. Works way better than the Magic Wand remote. You can use your touch pad to guide the cross hairs instead of pointing the remote and it makes life a lot easier.Secondly, the 3D is much better than I thought it would be. I figured it would just be a luxury that I only bust out on special occasions but it's actually pretty impressive. Haven't watched any 3D blu-ray movies yet but Batman: Arkham City looked really cool in 3D (XBOX 360) and 3Net on DirecTV had some cool 3D programming that looked great on this TV. ESPN 3D looked great too. Football and Baseball looked great while basketball looked okay. I used the 2D to 3D conversion on the Devils/Rangers game last night and it actually worked pretty well. Not as good as something that was shot in 3D but it was still impressive. Better than I thought.The 2D picture in HD is amazing. Just a great picture. I used the settings that Kevin Nicholls suggests in the comments section of his review and everything looks great. Mass Effect 3 (360) looks amazing on this TV.The only complaint I have has nothing to do with the TV itself. My TV arrived with a 2 inch dent on the frame in the top left corner of the TV. The screen in unharmed and the blemish isn't noticeable enough to make me send it back but it is a little disappointing. Can't really blame the seller (Electronic Express) because I don't know if they shipped it like that or if Fedex dinged it during delivery. Just something to consider when getting something like this delivered.All in all I would highly recommend this TV especially at the price they're offering it for (I got it when it was $1500). I read the reviews for this TV and it still exceeded my expectations.Edit: Oh and don't try to install the stand with the TV laying flat on the ground.

To best enjoy the features, you really need to have an HD signal routed through an HDMI cable. Not to sound like a commercial, try Monoprice for a cable before being scammed by local or other online retailers that will be too happy to sell you a cable for 10 to 100 times more than you really need to pay. We had the tv originally set up to receive SD signals through a cable box from Cox cable through a coaxial cable hook up. The picture was far superior to the same setup through our 10 year old Hitachi 36 inch tv (which had GREAT resolution when it was rated by Consumer Reports way back in the day). With BlueRay disks through an inexpensive Magnavox player via HDMI cable, the difference in quality between broadcast and the disks was very noticeable. We switched our service to include HD chanels (which somehow reduced our cable bill), and switched the coaxial cable between the box and the tv for another HDMI cable and found that the difference was on par with changing from AM radio to CD's.This LG tv has so many additional features accessible via the wireless hookup or via a LAN cable. Having tried them both, the wireless option is acceptable, but limits the functionality of the tv to take full advantage of Internet accesable features like movies from Amazon, Vudu, Netflix, CinemaNow, and others. A wired LAN connection allows almost instant access to everything including streaming HD, HDX, and 3D movies. As for 3D movies, they are GREAT! Even if you play 2D movies and set the tv to \"fake 3D,\" the results are impressive. Passive 3D glasses included with the tv work very well to show your regular movies with increased depth.This tv also has the ability to receive PLEX broadcasts from a computer server so you can stream iTunes, Aperture photos, and other videos. With no problem. If you have a Picasa, Facebook, Twitter, or Skype account, you can also access these easily through the tv  (Skype requires an additional camera). Surfing the Internet is also possible, but the main disadvantage is the lack of connectivity to a Bluetooth keyboard. With the tv, you get two remotes; one regular remote and one that is similar to a Wii remote. The \"Wii-like remote\" is somewhat limited its utility, but allows easy control for younger viewers due mainly to its limited number of buttons. It is not an option that I would recommend paying extra for, but, as it is included in the tv package, does not distract from the overall tv performance.Bottom line for this tv; I wish that I purchased this much sooner, but am glad that I waited until something this advanced was available for so little $$$. Get this one or the 55 inch version if your tv room can accommodate it.

Biresch \"TEEman\"", "ReviewID": "R171Y4B72APJAC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just have the TV for a day after purchasing from Amazon.com so yes, I still have my fingers crossed that this was the correct purchase.I was fortunate to get this TV at a very nice sale price, as I think the normal price for this LG model is excessive.  3D may be a nice option, but unless you have children, there is very little use for 3D at this point.  I only went with this model as I read tons of reviews all over the Net (I read Amazon's reviews, but I like to get independent reviews too, to verify everything) and the overall opinion from all the sources was that this LG and one SONY model were probably the top choices for this size and this price range.  And with the Amazon special value sale price, it was $2000 less than the alleged equivalent from SONY anyplace.First let me say that I was pleased with Amazon's fast shipment and the delivery.  I got free economy delivery which they use HomeDirect.  The TV came exactly 7 days after I ordered it, very quick in my mind.  HomeDirect has had extremely bad reviews for tons of delivery problems as did Paul's TV (the co-supplier on this sale) for shipping defective items.  Both did well in my mind.There were minor glitches with HomeDirect.  I got an e-mail in the middle of the week, giving me notice that they would probably be delivering the TV that Friday.  To my surprise, their e-mail said they would unpack the TV, plug it in and make sure it was working.  SUPER!!!!  They called two days in advance to verify the Friday delivery and I requested an afternoon delivery.  No problem per customer service.  A day later, I went to their site on the Net, the status said 1:47 PM that Friday delivery estimated.  Great!!  I got a call the day before, and the dispatcher said 11 AM.  I said that was okay though I preferred afternoon, but go with 11AM.  I get a call at 8 AM the next morning, saying the truck would be there in 30-40 minutes. WOW, rush time.  Anyway, they came and put the TV in my living-room.  As customer service had said, they agreed to move my old TV off the stand onto a table nearby even though moving anything in the house wasn't in the package.  But all they would do is drop off the TV in the box and not unpack the TV.  After moving my old TV, they just left.  I quickly called customer service and they had the truck come back.  The men apologized saying they mis-read the delivery package thinking it was drop-off only.  I asked if they would not mind moving the old TV into another room on that floor, and they said yes.  They unpacked the LG and powered it up to make sure it worked and the remote worked.  GREAT.  My fears about HomeDirect and Paul's TV were satisfied.  The TV came and is in great shape so far.Some have said it was hard to set-up the TV.  Well I am watching it, I think I pretty much set up everything and was able to do it without reading the manuals yet.  Now I have not tried Smart TV or any of the applications, but I will be reading up on that today as I don't want to get into something I shouldn't.Overall, this has been a pleasant buying experience.  The TV came as advertised and promptly.  So far it operates as expected.  I didn't expect the economy free shipment to include unpacking and checking the TV to see if operating, a big plus.  The picture so far is very good and for now I only have standard DirecTV digital input,  but I will probably be upgrading to high definition in the near future.I did purchase the 5 year LG extended warranty as I know these types of TV's do not hold up nearly as well as the old style ( my old SONY lasted over 20 years).  I am not big on extended warranties as doing retail in the past, I know extended warranties are mostly for store profit.  But with the failure rate on LCD's being reported high, and the cost of repair plus the cost of this TV,  this is one time I really feel extended warranties are a must. Though it must be from a reliable source and from reviews I read in different sites, it looks like LG is good.  I know there are some really bad extended warranties out there.The magic remote is nice, and almost self explanatory.  Like I said, I was able to set up the TV without using the manual, though after reading it, maybe there is more to be done, we will see.I have read other reviews and I do think LG needs to add a remote keyboard for the Smart TV. But that is left to been determined.  The Magic Remote pointer is okay but if there is typing to do, I can imagine it will be a pain without a keyboard and almost useless.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love my LG TV", "Author": "PhotoHawk", "ReviewID": "R2F9ZWTN2B4GUJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased in June 2011, replaced a 5 year old 40 inch Samsung.

For comparison purposes I had an 07 42\"vizio 720p/1080i 60hz.My one complaint first, the stand is garbage, seems flimsy and it sits about 1/8 - 3/8\" crooked. This doesn't impact the viewing experience but I know it is there and it upsets me.Picture quality is excellent. I used the calibration settings on CNet and just turned up the backlight beyond their specs since I have the TV in a bright room. PS3 games look fantastic. I had grown tired of Skyrim after 160 hours of gameplay but once I saw it in 1080p 3d I had to start a new character. On any HD programming I absolutely love it. For non HD programming or programming that is older the quality can be a bit blurry with the 120hz (again was used to viewing in 60hz) but that is minimal impact to me.User interface is decent and the preloaded applications are pretty easy to use, great for me to nerd out on Netflix documentaries. Wifi connectivity setup was a breeze. The browser is worthless though, so no surfing on the TV, hook up the laptop or fire up the gaming system if that is your thing.Passive 3d - fantastic experience. I will not debate picture quality of active vs passive 3d with anyone but passive is the right choice for me. At the retail store watched some Blu-Ray aquatic documentary and it was really sweet, the fish swam out at you and the glasses are really non intrusive, just like a pair of light weight sunglasses. And the price of replacement glasses - negligible vs the active glasses of Samsung TVs. I feel like when using the 2d-3d conversion it adds depth to the picture as opposed to things flying out of your TV, still very cool. If you are super 3d nerd and need the utmost picture quality and more depth then maybe active is the way to go, but for me I love upgrading video games to 3d and the occasional sporting event or HBO movie and now again rent the Blu-Ray 3d so Active is ideal.

As far as I am concerned the picture is as \"good as it gets.\"  There is not one lost pixel or the peculiar show of light at the borders as I read about in other TV sets.  This is a second generation 3D that uses common movie theater 3D glasses instead of the expensive electronic ones. The 3D is quite wonderful.  You can sit anywhere to see the picture, but you will loss the effect if you stand.  As no one in my family likes to watch movies standing, it has never been a problem.  The first 3D video I saw on this set, I could not believe I was sitting in my own living room.  We saw Avatar 3D at an IMax.  Our home viewing was better because of the closeness of the screen, the visual image on the retina was quite large and the entire experience was more intimate.It has great internet interface that permits seamless connection to all popular video downloading venues like Kindle, Netflix, iTunes, etc.  It also has a pointer that acts like a mouse that lets you key information or \"click\" options quite easily.  The sound is more than adequate, and as good as I have ever had with a TV.  The prices was also extremely completive; actually outstanding.I bought the LG Infinia 47w5600 in September and have waited a few months to test it out before writing the review.

Well, it came down to which has longer life - tv's do in general since on projectors, like the panasonic PT-AX200u that I have, need to have their bulbs changed every 2,000 to 5,000 hours, depending on how intensely they are used, and brand. So, tv was the way to go I thought.Having the 55\" 3D LG tv I thought would be big enough. Found out it's not after having a 130\" projected screen, but I figured with 3D and longer viewing life with a tv, it's a compromise - oh, and price: I bought it used since it was only $1,064 and stated \"good\" from Amazon Warehouse deals but seemed excellent to me when I got it- minus what I found out.After having the tv for 3 weeks I had to finally return it.I was noticing a lot of scenes in 3D had a double-image in the bottom left & right corners.I researched more and found at [...] that this is what those reviewers found on the more upscale LG 55LW6500 tv also. They said \"The only drawback was some blurring in the bottom right and left corners of the screen\". Well, same applies here for the LG 55LW5600. Atleast I'm assuming that blurring = double image.Either way, the bottom right & left corners are exactly a triangle size each about 5\" long at it's base (determined a triangle shape when had dark scenes). Kinda noticeable and disappointing to myself and the other viewers in my party.I didn't just leave it at that. I tried adjusting distance physically and in the options. Nothing changes it.

Unless your superman and have supper vision that can detect things that the average person can't, you will more than likely be pleased with this TV.  We rented Cars 2 through Brighthouse/Time Warner on demand in 3D and were extremely impressed.  The 2D to 3D technology works better than I though it would as well.  The 2D high deffinition picture is incredible when in 1080.  Nice features include the smart TV which give you access to VUDU which also rents 3D movies.  The motion remote is great for the women who hate three remotes laying around, point and click, very simple stuff.  You can even name your inputs to logical things like game, blu-ray, cable box, etc.  An unadvertised feature in the box is a CD with Nero MediaHome Server.  You simply install this on your computer within your home network and you instantly have access to all of your photos, music and videos that are stored on your computer.  When your computer is on, it shows up as another available input.If you have a amp/tuner for home theatre speakers, I would reccomend all switching through the TV as opposed to the Tuner.

I mostly watch sports and all I can say is WOW!!  Viewing a football game on this TV is amazing.  The screen is big and the colors and images just pop off the screen.  Football looks the best, but basketball and just about any other sport feels like you're right there. And unlike an earlier reviewer, I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY BLUR WHATSOEVER! Fast moving images and action come across beautifully with no trails or blur.  I also have started watching a great deal more movies as this TV makes you want to stay in front of it.  Of course, Blu-Ray quality movies are the best. I am able to play movies from my computer and they come through pretty clean. To ensure this, I run a CAT 5 e cable from my router to my TV. The TV can can do this wirelessly, but the manual recommends (and I second) a wired connection to be better. After downloading the included Nero MediaHome software to my computer, I was able to play any file easily.  I must add that the navigation of these files could be easier, as well as navigation of the apps on the TV, such as NetFlix etc. Playing the apps you have is no problem, but finding new ones can be a chore.  Also, for some reason, Flash doesn't seem to be supported when you browse on the internet with this TV. The 3D feature is nice and while there is little 3D content out there right now, the few times I have used it, it looks nice. The 2D to 3D feature is a nice touch, as it converts regular programming to 3D. Sports look really good this way! This is my first flat screen TV and as I understand, these TV's don't have good sound, and this TV is no exception.  However, the viewing experience is beautiful, as is the TV itself.

The first one that was delivered was bad out of the box.  The shipping carton and it's styrofoam supports were unscathed but the point at the lower right corner of the TV was missing but it was not found in the box.  I suspect that the TV was damaged in the factory prior to being packed and shipped.  That was very disappointing to say the least.  Picked up the phone and called Amazon and told them that the TV had an issue and without even asking me to describe the problem they scheduled a replacement to be delivered to me ASAP.  This happened on Wednesday December 14th and I was told by the Amazon rep that it would take about a week to get the replacement delivered.  Much to my delight the shippers called the next Saturday and asked if I would like for the TV to be delivered that day the only caveat being that there would be no shipper provided setup - I didn't need any setup assistance so they brought the TV out early Saturday afternoon and picked up the defective unit.  I've had the TV for about 2 weeks now and I am absolutely thrilled with the TV.  I'm using Amazon Prime Video as well as Netflix using the built in LG internet access features.  I am happy with both Amazon Prime and Netflix, I couldn't be happier with the LG TV.  The blacks are inky black and the bright images are awesome.

Using the arrow keys to type is also slow. I gave up after it took 2 minutes to type \"sons of\" in the TV's YouTube app's search box.

I was confused, everything fell in place as I read the manual. Connected Netflix, Hulu plus and Vudu with no problem. I had no network problem what so ever. Connected the PS3 and tried to view a Blu-Ray, Imax, The ultimate wave 3D.  Amazing.  took me a while to understand all the TV setting but once I got it. It was Amazing, The 3D effect is in the movie is not that great and you won't see so much things popping out near your face but good quality.

I'm not the most savy electronics person ( just ask my Ex-wife who now owns my 47 inch LG, for clarification), so I was expecting this to be a hassle to get set up. I started out slow, by just hooking up cable TV. That only took 5 minutes, so now I was ready to attempt the DVD and VCR. That was another 5 minutes and so I tested out the 2D to 3D feature with a Get Smart CD. Wow! How cool seeing a black and white episode of Get Smart in semi 3D! I turned off the energy saver feature, since it was making the picture too dark for the room the TV is in and that helped a lot. The picture is great! I'm only using a $40 DVD player and no HDMI cable hook up for either the DVD player or the VCR and the picture is still great! I read up on the internet connection issues many people have, not with only this TV but all Smart TV's. Though I have wireless at the house, I figured I would be hard-wiring just to avoid the frustration, so I had already measured out how many feet of cable I would need to get to the router downstairs. I figured I would at least try the provided adapter that came with the LG and see how it went. Plugged it into the back of the TV and in about 5 seconds, I was updating the TV software and registering to begin installing the Applications I wanted! It worked flawlessly and no hardwiring. My router is 65 feet away and one floor down and no problems at all getting the connectivity. The magic wand remote works great too. I sit 15 feet away from the TV and both remotes work super. You don't even have to point them to mute, turn on/off or adjust volume. Just hit the buttons as they sit there next to you on the couch and they respond! So, my only gripe would have to be the Apps provided. It reminds me of when the first Nintendo Game systems came out. Pretty bad and a lot of improvement needed. I'm still experimenting though. I hooked my laptop up to the TV and it's great to use it as a monitor to look at Powerpoint slides, photos, porn (just kidding).

Everything works well out of the box, and the wireless dongle was easy to setup.  When you plug it into the USB port, TV detected right away and will give u an option to configure.After doing some searching, apparently there is a hack to bring up the LG Ez Adjust menu where you can turn on the what is called \"THX\" profiles.  Basically from what I learned, with THX, they are standard for motion pictures and it supposed to create better picture that matches with the professional films.  Google for more) So in order to bring up this menu, you have to have a universal remote and I think only certain kind will work.  For me, I used an old Comcast universal remote.  You need to google for 55lw5600 thread on AVS Forum for the instructions.After I call up the THX profiles, I do believe it makes the picture much sharper than the calibrated settings I got from CNET.  Some people claim that THX will not help but in my case it does, so it's YMMV.One thing I don't like about this TV is streaming 3D mkv file over wireless network.  Before you scream about wireless network, hear me out.  I have a Sammy C8000 3D and I stream both of these via built-in ethernet that is hooked into a wireless bridge that is connected to the main wireless.  My Samsung handles the 3D mkv without a hitch, where as LG suffers badly.  LG exhibits choppy and laggy video and it's not even worth it.

The picture on this tv is incredible, blacks are done to perfection and NFL football is taken to another level, even in the 2D-3D conversion setting.

Picture quality is awesome in 1080P. A standard DVD played in Blu-ray player on this TV was like watching a HD movie--totally amazing.  Sound is great even without external receiver or speakers.  Some flaws with the TV in order of nuisance.  1.  Contrast with blacks is not that good. Color brightness is great but dark scenes wash out in the blacks.  2.  Blurring does occur during fast motion or certain scenes.  Doesn't happen all the time so not a major complaint.  3. Clouding is noticable when the screen is all black, for instance during transitions between previews or during scenes in a movie.  The screen is not a solid black, but has very faint lighting that looks like clouds on the screen. It isn't noticeable during scenes with normal brightness and colors.  Once I noticed it on a black screen, it is barely perceptible on dimly lit/dark scenes as well.  Also, left side has a little bleed through from the edge lighting.  Again, only noticeable on dark scenes.  4.  NO PANDORA!  I know its not a big deal to some but if you are going to sell a Smart TV with Premium Apps--I don't understand why you would leave out Pandora.  5.  Smart TV is worthless to me.  I don't use any of the other apps.A great TV with minor flaws in image quality.  I really thought about getting a Panasonic Plasma or Samsung x7000 or x8000 for another room in the house.  Plasma just doesn't have the brightness as an LED. Go to an electronics store and look at a Plasma next to an LED, to see the difference.

Viewing a blue ray action movie and having TV convert to 3D - Very good. The foreground objects will be 3D-ish but the TV may blur out the background to achieve this affect. I believe this is called critical focus. Not a game changer.  Viewing an HDTV channel and having TV convert to 3D - here is the true mixed bag. Remember the critical focus affect? It very prominent here. This greatly affects sporting events as they always have a scoreboard up in one corner and a stats ribbon down below. These are the most prominent and get the best 3D effect, with the players getting enough effect to make them look like they are floating above the playing field. The field gets the blur.Movies with lots of digital effects get almost a 3D effect similar to the blue ray conversion. Older movies get some effect, mostly just the faces and that's kinda creepy.I love this TV. 2D channels look kinda washed out but IO think that's just my old cable box (Scientific Atlanta on Time Warner) but I almost always go to the HD versions now.I don't see ghosting, nor coloring issues.

At one occasion I had to use a USB drive, for some reason the movie was freezing after some time.Internet browsing:Works but a little slow to my taste.MY BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT:The TV has a very delicate plastic frame that has thin transparent edges surrounding the black plastic front frame (you have to see it in a store) and when I got the TV, right out of the box one corner edge was BROKEN and near the same corner, on the left side of the TV it looks like the transparent edge is damaged by applying pressure to this side when it was warm (it looks melted).

They unpacked the new TV plugged it in and made sure that it is not damaged. Also they packed the TV for the return - which I did not expect - so overall I am very happy with the delivery serviceLG vs Toshiba -I purchased this TV after returning the Toshiba 55\" LED Passive 3D TV. The main reason for the return was the Smart TV features in LG is much more than Toshiba and Toshiba TV does not recognize the DLNA network, even though the manual said it does, I could not get it working and Toshiba customer support could not care less. I must say this was the worst customer support I have ever witnessed in any company. However all the other features of the Toshiba TV is good - but the LG is better except for the network bandwidth - the Toshiba had a built-in wireless adapter which was connecting to my home network at 18 mbps, the LG comes with an external USB adapter which is giving less than 2 mbps and that is the only downside I could find for this TV everything else is very very good.Picture, sound and 3D quality -It took me a few days to understand and adjust all the features in the LG TV, unlike Toshiba, LG gives you many more option to adjust everything and it took a while for me to understand all of them - once I did - the results are very good and magic wand (remote control) is truly magical - easiest TV remote I have seen so far.120 Hz vs 240 Hz -This LG TV has the refresh rate of 120 Hz and Toshiba had 240 Hz - but I do not see any difference in performance - all the sports that I watch looks the same - if you look very carefully a little bit of ghosting can be found in some of the sequences in a game however one will not notice it if they are not looking for it. This is true for both the TVs so I do not find any difference in performance for the higher refresh rate.Smart TV Features in LG -I am very happy with this network TV - I have connected it with the media server and able to see the photographs and home videos. Also the internet web browser works reasonably well - only downside is the browser does not support Flash Player - I guess - that is by design since they want the video access limited to customized video applications like Netflix, Vudu, Amazon etc.Final Comment -I have this TV for 3 weeks and I am impressed with the performance - the only complaint is the network band width of the wireless adapter - for which I may need to put in a wired connection - otherwise - this is a very good TV at a very reasonable price - I would say - this is the best value for money for any budget concuss buyer on Internet today.", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV", "Author": "Mickeyb1", "ReviewID": "R1LG5P12M6JH2J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The picture on this TV is perfect and the sound is very good.

Yet for me, it did not live up to expectations.  Starting with the very beginning and end, CEVA's delivery and subsequent pickup was timely and courteous.  In the middle though, I was unfortunately confronted with issue after issue and finally gave up when I could not develop an exhaustive list of workarounds.  So here it is:The Good: With a relatively thin bezel and handsome clear plastic edging that is similar to some Samsung models, this is a truly beautiful television.  I do not agree with other reviewer's comments of a flimsy base.  I found the base sturdy and well made.  The 3D is ok but you may find yourself rarely picking up the glasses.  For some programming, especially sports, the picture is outstanding. LG's technical support was also very good;  I did not expect to have a live person answer so quickly, with no routing, and provide real information.The Bad: Hey, I had to call tech support!  With my previous Samsung 46\" LCD, I never once opened the manual or even thought about calling their technical support; picture was perfect and everything was intuitive.  Had my youngest not thrown a remote at the screen I'd still be watching it.  I hoped for a similar experience with the LG and did not get it.  First, it comes delivered with the \"Trumotion\" feature turned on.  This feature does improve sports viewing but creates what is called the \"Soap Opera\" effect on film.  That was a hard one to diagnose - too many hours wasted and thinking that I spent near $1,400 for a TV that makes movies look like they were shot on video.  With that eventually solved, I then turned my attention to hooking up my home theater system.  Even though my system worked great with my Samsung, with the LG I had a horrible echoing if I chose to have the system on and TV volume on simultaneously.  Yes, some aficionados abhor the idea of keeping both on.  LG's technical support said the reason was because sound moves slower through HDMI cables than through the old red/white ones.  To fix, I'd either need to upgrade my stereo to one that can have lag programmed or try connecting an optical cable from the only TV output to the receiver.  That's seemed like too much work so I resigned myself to muting the TV when using the home theater.  Next, I tried using the internet apps like YouTube.  Tough GUI to navigate so I resigned myself to buying a smart blue-ray instead.  Speaking of blue-rays, be ready to go into your blue-ray settings and change output to 24FS (if you don't the picture will be screwy on the LG).  Funny, I never had to do that with my old TV. Finally on the picture, I found myself constantly jumping from Standard, to Cinema, to Game views.  On my old TV I never looked at the picture and thought I needed to switch.  Forget the \"Intelligent Sensor\" view because it's not intelligent - the colors would inexplicably shift.The Ugly: I understand all LEDs have a hard time with blacks.  What was really, really annoying - and the nail in the coffin for me - was that there was a bleeding of brightness coming from the bottom-left part of the screen.  This resulted in inconsistent, blotchy black levels on the screen that presented the biggest problem when there were horizontal or vertical letterbox bars on the screen.  The TV did a much better job showing vertical bars when correcting to 4:3 standard viewing.  However, with \"ultra\" wide-screen 16:9 viewing (think Lawrence of Arabia or Star Wars), the horizontal bars come from the video itself and are not created by the TV so the black is not automatically adjusted to be darker.  Unfortunately, this leaves the horizontal bars being displayed in varying degrees of blackness, which after a while can be quite annoying.  True enough, this can be resolved by zooming in, but then you lose some viewing content.  I probably could live with this deficiency because I so rarely watch ultra wide-screen but I'm reminded of the defect every time I turn the TV on because the LG intro screen is black.Bottom line for me is that this was an expensive television that required too many workarounds and presented too many annoyances to live up to the price.Kudos though to Amazon - delivery, set-up, and return were fantastic.

I attempted every setting I could think of to correct this problem, even turned Tru-Motion off, Dejudder up, Deblur Off, and vice versa.  Nothing corrected the problem.  Several other television shows as well as netflix movies with fast scenes showed severe signs of ghosting, pixelation and distorted picture.  The 3D on this television is great!!!  Just make sure you plan out your viewing area properly.  You really need to be looking at the television straight on for the 3D to wow.  Ultimately though, I was disappointed with this television. Especially with all of the great reviews that were given.  I am not a television expert or a theater expert for that matter, but I do know what I believe a good picture should look like.  If the television could handle fast scenes or was possibly not defective this would be an excellent television at an exceptional price.  Unfortunately I have to send this television back for a refund.  This is in no way the fault of AMAZON.  AMAZON has been nothing but extraordinary and I would recommend them time and time again.  I hope this review helps in some way.  Maybe I am just unlucky.  Wouldn't be the first time.  I did decide to purchase a Vizio 55 inch Razr LED-LCD Smart Television from Costco.  The price was $1300 including all taxes.  This television wowed me with the clarity.  The colors have to be adjusted a bit but the wi-fi works better, faster.  HD quality from Netflix from the start.  And I conducted the \"Golden Eye\" test to which this television passed with flying colors.  Even better than the much more expensive Samsung 60 inch 7000 series which my brother-in-law owns.  I also performed the \"Golden Eye\" test on that television.  Anyways happy searching for that perfect television and I will continue to test my Vizio.  By the way...I have 90 days to return my television to Costco if the need or want should arise and I have a 3 year manufacturers warranty.

I absolutely love the picture, and the 3D is surprisingly not bad. To me, the picture is absolutely perfect. . . as good as any of the displays I saw at Best Buy. I'm glad I didn't end up spending more for a 240 Hz tv; I am watching HD NFL and again the picture looks perfect to me on this TV. Wifi and Netflix were also a breeze to set up.To answer my previous question, I probably waited because a tv this large wouldn't fit in my car and I wasn't sure if a delivery would work well.  However, the \"white glove\" service from Amazon's shipper, CEVA, was great.  They carried the TV right into my living room and unpacked the TV.The only negative thing I have to say is not about the TV at all (and therefore didn't impact the star rating). Amazon highlights their \"low price gty\" ensuring that if you find a lower price in the next 14 days they will refund the difference (which many people will probably think is for 30 days but that's a point I won't get in to in this review). However, buried in the fine print is the fact that you can only claim the lower price once.  I made a $7 claim on a $1400 TV, which I obviously wouldn't have done one day into the 14-day period if I had been aware of the one-time price-match clause. They must know this misleads a lot of people, because the rebate credit prominently informs people that they are not eligible for another credit.  Just be straight with us from the beginning. Now I feel like I have to stop being lazy and start shopping around, instead of just buying from Amazon like I usually do. It's not really about the money; I just don't like feeling misled.But to recap, this TV is great!", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Picture, Great Wireless, Great 3D Experience", "Author": "R.

White", "ReviewID": "RL1985AZTL5W7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have had this TV about 10 days. There are some great qualities about this TV, but there are definitely some trade-offs involved.  I'll try to elaborate below.First of all, I purchased this TV to replace a 6 year old plasma (Hitachi).  I liked the former, but it was only 1080i and I was tired of seeing reflections on the screen in my new bright living room. The bright nature of the room was my biggest driving concern when looking for a new tv.  Unfortunately, the requirement for a matte screen decreases the available TV options considerably (toss out all plasmas and most samsungs). The LG meets the matte screen criteria and is an improvement to my old situation. However, you will still see some reflection in the bright of day.The TV is thin.  Very thin.  Not something I needed, as it is not hanging on the wall.  And, as I read many times before purchasing, this thinness results in some tradeoffs in visual performance.  However, I went to box stores and could never appreciate the \"blooming\" or other artifacts described.  I thought these were probably only seen by trained people in a controlled environment. I could not have been more wrong. Once I started seeing these artifacts, I just started looking for them and now it drives me crazy. My partner doesn't notice so much, so it MAY not bother you.My next issue is with \"screen uniformity.\" When setting up the brightness, contrast etc, I began to notice that the top left corner of my screen cannot produce as bright and white of a white as the rest of the screen. So now I constantly stare at that when watching TV. I am trying to determine whether it is a fault with this TV or if it is within performance limits, as it is pretty subtle. As an aside, I used Disney's WOW blu-ray for setting the visual adjustments to the TV. You can buy that on amazon, too! Seemed to work pretty well and end result was similar to what cnet.com recommended using in their review.  However, their settings are a little dim for my taste, so this blu ray let me set more to my liking.I have a home theater system, so I have never used the tv speakers and cannot attest to that feature.I've only used the 3d once.  Not much content and comcast doesn't even have espn 3d in my market! Works well, though and definitely better than spending the big bucks for a bunch of active glasses for something that you will rarely use.Not sure if I will send this back or not. It is an improvement over my old plasma, but most anything would be. I think in the end it will be best used as a wall mounted tv in a room where visual performance is not important.  I cannot recommend this as a be-all performance tv for your home entertainment system, though.Hope this helps and I'll try to post an update if my eyes settle in a little better to the new TV.", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "sweet  ride", "Author": "the gorethox \"Helpful as I can\"", "ReviewID": "R2GF2GZMG11Q8J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I will give the best review I can.

I have networked it to my media server and it works great.  Now i dont have to go throught my playstation ( It even plays files that my playsation wont.

WE have been saving the glasses from the theater and they work great and no extra cost to us.  The 2d to 3d conversion works prettey well on some hd movies but it isnt the same when the item like an dvd or game was actually 3d encoded.

I do tons of research and decided to go with lg 55\" LED 5600 tv.  Awesome clarity and high def image for most viewing.  3d was good and glasses are cheap.  That is the reason I went with this tv over Panasonic ST30 series.  But when it came to sports...the LG was not so good.  Blur or shudder or pixelation....whatever you want to call it, it was just to annoying.  Recently just returned it and got the panasonic as originally planned.  I notice that most reviews talk about blu ray viewing or online services.  But not much about sports viewing.  I'm here to tell you, if you watch sports, go plasma!  No brainier.UPDATE 2-18-12..After a month or so with the plasma tv, I noticed something that may have made me rate this LG tv lower than it should be.  It seems like the pixelation/shudder noticed above may be due to my cable providers signals.  I notice that even on the plasma...certain channels ( and sometimes only on certain days) get the same type of \"pixelation\" during movement.  It is especially noticeable when you have seem something like Fox Sports...when their logo spins into the screen and graphics are moving around. Football games on certain days and certain channels (NBC/CBS for instance with me)  Yet on some days...crystal clear with no movement issues.  I wanted to mention this because I am having doubts that the review I gave above was accurate in regards to the TV being the problem.

Shipping took a week, but it was free so I am not complaining. Before dropping my hard earned money on a new big screen. I knew I was in a market for an LED LCD TV. The 3D capability of this TV was also very intriguing which further enticed my interest. I had PS3 so playing 3D blu rays and 3D games was a possibility. Picture quality is great out of the box.

If you are tech savvy you will be able to take advantage of all of them. HD quality on this TV is the reason why I will not watch other SD channels anymore. I had a 32' LCD before the HD quality of this TV is amazing. Which is why I purchased this TV because the majority of my viewing is going to be 2D HD. The 3D quality is better than theaters. I think passive 3D is a more comfortable experience. Try wearing the active shutter glasses if you can stand them go for it. Another thing that I have noticed is that the 3D picture is MUCH brighter and more life like than in the theaters or comparing to active shutter glasses. The 2D -> 3D conversion on this TV is also very good. My only complaint is that I wish there was more 3D content available at this point in time. Do your research look at electronic websites and consumer magazines, you will see this TV has a very good track record. Go to Best Buy and ask for the 3D demo for this TV you will be sold.

Months later I found a display at another Best Buy store where everyone could watch both systems. One was the Sony using active glasses and the other was LG using the passive kind of glasses. There was no quality difference, in fact I must say that the quality of the Sony image somehow disappointed me.

Vibrant, but reasonable color, good default settings, solid contrast. I'm still waiting for OLED TVs, but this is very good.The best image processing options on any TV. Hook up your set-top, laptop, or other computer via HDMI, hit Q.MENU on the remote, and then choose one of the bottom 2 \"expert\" image modes. As far as I can tell, this is the only line of TVs that allow you to totally disable sharpening when set to 50. In expert mode, you can even adjust settings for vertical and horizontal processing. My head asplod. Sony and Samsung can disable sharpening, but they incorrectly display text, so you'll get red and blue fringing on text that has ClearType enabled over HDMI. I guess they expect you to use the RGB input, but why would you want to and lose the pure digital connection + audio? There is a way to modify ClearType, but it does not seem to have an effect. Better to just get a TV that works.The matte screen is terrific. Yes, glossy screens look good in the store, but there is a reason they are called \"glare-type\" screens by some companies. I'm so glad LG is not using a glossy screen as we have plenty of mirrors in the house already. I'd rather see a movie without seeing the room reflected on the screen.The remotes are solid. Ours came with a full featured remote, and a small Wiimote-style remote. The Wiimote seemed a little questionable at first, but it's been great as it communicates with RF (radio frequency) and does not need to be aimed at the TV at all to use it. When that obnoxious ad comes on at 200% volume, you can just mash the volume down button with the puny remote right on your coffee table. No need to grab the remote, aim it at the TV, and then hit the volume button. It also provides a mouse cursor on-screen for those of you who need to watch YouTube through your TV. The IR emitter on the normal, full featured remote is also very powerful (unlike some Samsung remotes); you can use it at random angles and it often surprises us.Input handling is very intelligent. Turn on a digital device and the TV will ask you if you want to switch to it on a small pop-up dialogue. Chances are, if you just turned on your PS3, you will probably be using it. Unlike the obtuse Samsung interface, you can force the TV to switch to an input that does not have any connection detected; sometimes, you need the TV to be \"ready and waiting\" on an input so that you can see what appears on-screen right when the device is turned on (e.g. early rolling movie previews, computer bootup BIOS screens, etc.). This LG lets you do that.3D gaming works perfectly. At any decent viewing distance, the resolution difference is not noticeable compared to active shutter glasses. The 3D performance of console systems is another story.The 3D image is silky smooth and natural, unlike the jittery and unstable 3D image exhibited on some active shutter systems. The glasses are feather light, cheap as hell, can be easily washed/cleaned (no electronics) and don't look incredibly lame.Metal back construction makes it surprisingly tough and durable.

The picture quality is as good as any TV I've seen in the local stores--clarity, colors, adjustment options are astonishing. The ability to convert regular TV into virtual 3D is quite impressive when picture quality is good to start with. This is particularly important because real 3D content availability is still very limited. And when watching programs filmed in 3D--WOW! The passive glasses are comfortable and the flip-on works just as well. (I wear corrective glasses). They are by far more comfortable than the active glasses.

I then looked at the types of 3D TVs... Active and Passive. I went with Passive (this TV type of 3D) in the end because you don't need batteries for the glasses, the glasses are cheaper, they are also more comfortable and lighter, also the active glasses are constantly changing from dark to light, and i really didn't like that so much. I just wanted the passive Movie theater type of glasses. The fact that this TV came with 4 3D Glasses and the Sony and Samsung came with zero was definitely a factor in the decision. The 2D to 3D Conversion is pretty cool. It does actually work well.

However, please keep it mind while watching 3d the resolution will be cut into half because of passive 3d technology. I seat 8 feet away from the tv and it is not that much distinguishable for me so I am OK with this half resolution. I always get blown away by the Imax Under water 3d video when the fish comes out from the tv up to 6 feet.4. I have set the TV auto update feature ON, and it updated itself quite often (started with version 2.something... and now it is 4.something). I am located in NJ and use Optimum onlines' 15mbps connection which is good enough to watch 3d video from vudu, and hd videos from netflix and huluplus.5. I didn't like the fact that you can't sign in to your youtube account and view your playlist as you can do with lg bluray player. I wonder why LG tv didn't have that feature.6. Please do not buy this tv if you are going to use it in slower connection internet, it just won't work that well (as I told you before, in SD, the picture quality is horrible).7. I enjoyed the 2d to 3d video a lot, that way I watch my family videos recorded many years ago in 3d, the effects are not as the videos that are originally recorded in 3d, but it is quite impressive. The depth can be controlled while you are watching this converted videos(conversion happens real time).8. I recently downloaded the LG SDK to develop my own tv apps but found very limited resource to get myself start with... hoping to do it someday soon.If you are fine with the few problems I mentioned above, you can buy this tv and be happy like me.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "love it!", "Author": "Tim", "ReviewID": "R2JHJ1WC0EN56K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "tv is awesome !

I've associated LCD/LED TVs with high contrast and overly-saturated imagery which was OK for sporting events, but ruins most anything else.  Electronic consumer stores like BestBuy have only reinforced my views by setting their TV's to display over-the-top contrast and saturated pictures.  But when it was time to upgrade my ancient Panasonic plasma, I read a lot of articles on the web that convinced me that LCD/LEDs have come a long way, and LCDs had three features I particularly wanted:  matte screens for superior display in bright lit rooms, energy efficiency, and light weight for easy mounting.All that said, I'll briefly touch on the most salient features of the 5600.Image quality:The 5600 is capable of producing well balanced imagery.  The default settings are too punchy, but LG has developed a reputation for providing a ton of picture controls, and the 5600 is no exception.  Beyond the standard adjustments, you have access to two expert modes which give you adjustments such as 10 point color temperature settings.  But the standard control settings give more than enough control to produce a pleasing, natural, evenly lit picture.  This plasma lover is impressed.  In sunlight, it exceeds what my plasma can produce, and in dim light, it isn't too far off.  Overall, a solid performer.My quick tuning advise: disable TruMotion (dejudder), reduce contrast down to 93, reduce sharpness down 58, set Local Dimming to high, and turn off super resolutionLet me just mention that the auto energy saving mode works great.  It dims the picture to match the light levels in the room.  I keep it in that mode all the time.As I don't have any support material, I can't comment on the 3d quality.  I didn't buy the TV for that feature, and until Xbox has some 3d gaming, I don't think I'll ever use it.Audio:What?  Which is to say, weak.  Ok for broadcast TV, but it can't handle dynamic sound that comes from movies.  There's a port on the back to export the audio.  Use it.Remote Controls:The 5600 comes with 2 remote controls and a remote control app that runs on your Android or Iphone device.  One of the two remote controls is your typical button filled device.  Works great.  The second remote control is a minimalist unit that navigate menus using motion sensors.  Basically a Nintendo Wii like experience.  Not for everyone.But the smartphone App is amazing.  It give you a touch pad experience which is great for navigating the 5600's internet suite. When you have to input text, the app pulls up your smart phone's keyboard, which is ten times faster to use than the TV's built in keyboard.  Best yet, on my android, I can speak the text and it shows up on the LG - very cool!Internet Suite:Since I already own a Roku, I wasn't shopping for a TV with apps.  But I'm happy to say that LG's implementation of Amazon video store is so good, I've been able to move my Roku onto another TV.  The internet browser in conjunction with the smartphone control app is actually decent for navigating news sites.  It does have Adobe flash, but an older version that many video sites do not support.  I wonder if they'll update that.You can connect to the internet via wire or a supplied USB wireless device (supports G & N protocols).  Works great.Video Games:There is a video mode for games that shuts of all the tv enhancements to minimize game lag.  Works great - I haven't noticed any lag.Summary:The 5600 is overall a great, well integrated package.  It can be adjusted to produce a very natural looking picture that looks great in both bright and dim lit rooms.  The internet app suite is surprisingly useful, and features like the remote control wand and the smartphone remote control apps reflect great product design.

Blue ray DVDs are SPECTACULAR and 'regular\" DVDs look great. I did some homework in selecting a 3D player and ended up settling on the Panasonic ( 3D) 210. Works great with this TV.I went for 3D figuring that just like the \"regular\" DVDS, that the price (now high) would eventually come down and more titles would become available. For me it was a 'futures\" play figuring people don't buy TVs  every few years ( not me anyway) so might as well get features that will be more valuable as time passes...'nice to have now\" and a \"must have \" in a couple of yearsThe TV came with a printed operator manual which just covers the basics. If you want to get into the incredible capabilities of this TV you need to load the \"complete\" manual included on a disk with the TV. It gets into the 'nitty gritty' of fine tuning picture adjustments using what they call \"Expert one\" and 'Expert two\" menus to adjust and store picture values , ie backlight, brightness, contrast, individual color controls, etc.The factory presets ( \"intelligent', \"Vivid' \"standard'\" \" Cinema\" \"game\" , etc) are handy but a real pro 'calibration requires loading custom parameters in the Expert 1 and 2 setups.If you know anything about conventional CRT tVs you know that contrast and brightness adjustments are critical to picture quality. Unfortunately most people don't realize that if you run a TV with these two adjustments \"cranked up high\" to give a really bright picture that you were doing this at the expense of shortening the life of the CRT.I believe the same is true with the \"backlight\" , Brightness\" and Contrast of this LED edge lit , lcd pixel TV.So I like to run on the \"expert menu selection in which I can \"turn down\" the light output.  It takes a little getting used to as the picture is less bright ( closer to the \"cinema\" selection mode offered in the TV set up).While the picture is not as bright, the flesh tones and general color reproduction is much better than the 'standard settings'This TV is SPECTACULAR in a brightly lit room or window daylight. This is its element. The only complaint that some folks have is that because its an edge light LED design, in a very dark room you get some 'brighter areas\" around the edges if the picture content is a dark scene. For me its an \"I don't care\".As to screen size...Wow I pondered over this big time ( several trips to a big box store to compare 47\" vs 55\". I did some reading and learned that for most people on a big screen purchase is that they regret that they didn't get \"bigger\". The LG 47\" 5600  is a beautiful TV but in the end, I went with the 55\" 5600.... Boy am I glad I did !! but this is your call.To sunmarize...I couldn't be happier with this TV. If you buy one, I'll bet you have the same experience.Good luck!UPDATE...  3/14/12I received my free AVATAR 3D blu ray disk ( with purchase of Panasonic 3d model 210 player). It was the very first 3D dvd I have viewed.. Standard blu ray DVD look great in \"3D simulated\" mode . However , this \"real 3d DVD absolutely blew me away.  INCREDIBLE !!!

I started to wonder when I was reading all the reviews here on Amazon as to if I was really going to like it as much as I do or not.  I did check the TV out and placed it against other TV's before I purchased it, I went to the store and saw it on display and saw its picture versus other TV pictures.  However, I started to wonder if maybe they had placed the settings differently on the display then the TV came to make it look like it did.  Just about every one of the reviews that I read talked about how they had to tweak the TV to get it how they wanted.  I didn't have to do this, and I'm seriously happy with this TV.  I simply took it out of the box, placed it on the stand, turned it on, and started enjoying TV.  3D TV at that, the picture is great and the HD is that much better.  I had it replace a 55\" Vizio which is a TV that I was very happy with, and simply got replaced because I wanted to have 3D.The manual for the TV, that has a lot to be desired.  It really isn't hard to understad, but it really doesn't break down what the settings are for and what they do.  It doesn't even really tell you much about how to put the TV in 3D or get it to convert 2D - 3D, but after playing around with the remote and the TV for a while, I found all the settings that I needed and was able to set them how I wanted.  Now I didn't need to tweak any settings to get a better picture, it was more the change the sound and things like that.  This was temporary though as I have a surround sound system that is hooked up as well, but wasn't at the time because I didn't have the remote programmed to this new TV.  I wanted to try out the TV and got it hooked up to see what it could do and watch some stuff and not mess around with getting all the sound system hooked up.  I have not been disappointed by this TV at all.  In fact, the 3D has really impressed me.The TV has a very crisp and clear picture. I'm not sure if I got it so clear because the size of my room keeps me a distance away from the TV.  It may be due to the fact that the distance that I set from the TV is the recommended distance for the size that the TV is, but the picture is clear and the 3D movies are just about the same as going to the theatre and watching the 3D there.  The non 3D looks really good as well, it is the same if not better picture quality as the old TV that I had.  I was really hesitant to get rid of that TV because I was really happy with the picture quality that it had and didn't see any other TV with the quality that I got from it.  I do see a lot of different TV's too as I work for a cable company and my job is installing TV for lots of people.  Part of installing the services for them is hooking up our HD cable to their TV and I can see and compare picture quality because of this.  That is part of the way that I picked out that TV and this TV hasn't let me down either.

I knew I wanted to get a bigger screen and since 3D is where its heading towards I figured this was my best bet. I did a lot of reading on the difference between passive and active 3d and overall the benefits to passive seem to outweigh the few disadvantages. I think the 3D looks really cool and it will need to be customized to your individual preferences at first but its really awesome when you find your settings. I took the advice of another review and went to hometheaterdotcom for my calibration settings and the picture does look awesome. I really like the local dimming feature, even though in a dark room on a dark screen like the movie credits you can see the light variations where the words are I still think over all its a well used funciton. The tv has a really nice picture and the features it has are really cool. I particularly love the nero media home which creates a neat little linked network between your computer and your tv (if you have wi-fi) and allows you to view content on your computer like music or movies and play through your tv. No more tieing up the laptop to watch movies. Hulu works a little slow so thats a little annoying but its still nice to not have to run my laptop or xbox just to use it. Overall I think this is a great tv and if you can tolerate the very slightly brighter outer edges (hence edge lit) this tv is really awesome. And I emphasize on the slight cuz with local dimming turned on its not hardly noticeable. The tv has a slew of apps that I havent checked out but I just couldnt get over the really nice nero feature. For the price this is a great tv without the 3D...the 3D makes it almost a steal.", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good quality TV", "Author": "Thong Ngo", "ReviewID": "R3FKG9OR51HANF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very good quality TV, I'm impressed.

Haven't yet tried the LG on any true 3D source media, but it should be great.  We have a 5.1 surround sound system, so we really don't use the TV's speakers (but when we do, they sound pretty good to me). The LG comes with a dongle for internet connectivity, but our TV room has weak wireless signal, so I decided to hardwire from our FiOS router (much better!).

My old one was just a 32 inch. I decided to go big this time and got the 55. My only requirements were that I wanted it to be a smart TV with plenty of HDMI connections for all of my components. I really didn't care about the 3D. 3D always gives me a headache.I read tons of reviews and decided on this one. I looked for the right television for over 2 months before deciding to buy this one. When I bought it on Amazon, the big box stores had it for 400 dollars more. So it was a no-brainer to order here. I love that it's so thin and lightweight. Well packed and easy to install.I received it in good condition. It took about an hour to get it mounted and hooked up. Then all I could say is \"WOW\"!!!I love the picture on this TV. Right out of the box with factory settings, it was amazing. Of course I had to make adjustments for my personal preference, but LG did a great job with this unit. It is loaded with tons of options and extras. The Smart TV apps are awesome even though Pandora is missing. But that's not a big deal to me since it's available on the Blu Ray. I checked out the 3D and it was amazing on this set. I still won't watch a ton of 3D but it's nice that it's there if we want to use it. The 2D to 3D conversion is average. I wouldn't say that its awesome, but it's not bad. It's not good enough to make me want to watch everything in 3D. The sound built into the TV is average. Not terrible, but sort of tinny sounding. The speakers are pointed straight down so the sound comes out of the bottom of the screen.I paired up this TV with a Sony soundbar with sub. (Sony HT-CT150 3D Sound Bar System). I'm really happy with the results. The TV has a \"Home Theater\" setting for the sound. This allows me to connect all of my HDMI components through the soundbar, run an HDMI to the HDMI on the TV with ARC and control the entire system from one remote. I then programmed my Dish remote to control the TV. My Dish remote controls the TV, sound, and DVR.The two remotes that come with the TV are easy to learn and easy to use. The Wii like remote is awesome. It does take a little bit to get used to, but I use it primarily for the Smart TV functions. Otherwise, I use the Dish remote for normal TV functions.Overall, I was very nervous about this purchase but I am extremely happy with the results.  Great shipping from Paul's TV.

Originally I was not going to go with 3D, but it turned out not to add a lot extra to the price, so I went with it. Although there are not a lot of 3D TV channels or true 3D movies, I anticipate that this will change over time, making the 3D feature more valuable. To our surprise, the quality of the 3D picture is as good as you get in a movie theater. The viewing angle is very good for a LCD TV and the glare (when the sun shines onto the TV in the morning) is much less than on our previous Sony Trinitron's screen. The HD picture quality is excellent. The built-in wireless internet connectivity works well to streamline connecting to Netflix more easily than the old set-up we had using the WII. And we can connect to the internet easily for almost anything we want. Not sure if we can stream video which requires use of Flashplayer; haven't been able to figure out yet how to do this or if this is possible. But with a HDMI cable we can connect a laptop to the TV and get those videos without a lot of trouble. There are lots of features we are just starting to explore. This is definitely a major step forward in TV technology for us and so far we are very pleased with it. And with a price $700 below list price and with free shipping, we feel we got a good value.

We were just blown away by the HD picture quality. The colors and especially clarity are excellent, much better than the 42\" Panasonic plasma we previously used. Some 2D content actually looks 3D. Off center viewing is very good. Viewed from 9 feet, the size of the picture took a bit of getting used to, but I wouldn't want to go back to anything smaller. SD picture quality is fair. I think that has to do more with the screen size+content resolution than anything else. We haven't viewed any active 3D content yet, so I can't comment on that. Sound quality is adequate, but I have to turn the volume up fairly high to hear it well. Remote control functionality is good. The actual remote itself is poor. The buttons do not give a positive feedback when pressed, and their perceived center is not where the actual center of activation is. The connectivity options are very good. Plenty of HDMI, USB and other ports. Wireless interface/set-up is abysmal, entering the network ID and password is a PITA, and I still haven't got the TV to connect to our Linksys wireless router. All-in-all I am very satisfied with the purchase. If not for the crappy remote and wireless interface, I would have given this 5 stars.Update 03/19/2012 - After about 6 months of use, I am still very satisfied with the picture quality, but very frustrated with the quality of the sound, remote, and internet connectivity. The sound is okay for regular TV programming, but is lacking in volume and quality for movies. The ergonomics of the remote plain and simply suck to the point of it being essentially useless. Internet set up is terrible as well. There is nothing intuitive about it, and the written instructions are poor. We have a DSL connection that necessitates a change in the default IP address for the router, and I was never able to get the TV's wireless connection to work. Our other wireless devices don't have this issue, so I am faulting the TV, not the way I have the router set up. So I'd really rate this a 2-1/2. Great if all you do is watch TV over a wired connection. Lacking if you need excellent sound quality for watching movies, and a fail if you need wireless internet connectivity.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent picture and 3D, sound is so so", "Author": "J.

There's far less pixelization (though is still happens rarely on really busy images) and the picture even in non-3d mode seems to have a lot more depth and definitely more details. Deleivery was on time and painless. The guy set it up up to the power stage to confirm it was working. I just had to plug in the HDMI cords for content on my own. The 3D really is pretty amazing though not something we use often. We watched the US Open tennis finals with it on and bought two 3D movies with the set. The upconverting 3D of regular movies is impressive, nut not something I would use regularly. The glasses are the movie theater type and were a much better arrangement for me as the kids have lots of friends over and buying 10 sets of active shutter glasses just wasn't on my agenda. I'm somewhat used to the picture now but first time viewers comment without exception just on the regular picture. The sound can be disappointing on and seemingly inconsistent depending on the media source. All are hooked up via HDMI but some item are fine on volume 20 and others need almost 50 to be heard well. Yes, I should have it hooked up through the sound system, but to fair the Samsung didn't have this issue, the sound was much better on that unit. Now that unit was probably 2-3 times thicker than this one, but I think the sound could be improved.If you're going to have it hooked up to a sound system, I recommend this without reservation.

There are several modes and options that you can switch back and forth to have different settings for different content, if you need to do that.I like that the wireless adapter is included.  I don't really understand the point of the motion controller, but there is an android app that lets you control everything on your phone.The television apps are okay.

This TV came close to a great balance between quality, features and price.Will briefly describe some of the highlights of my experience:- I noticed the box where TV is coming it's less quality than Samsung, so it gives a first impression that it's a lower quality TV (but it's not)- It's a little more heavier than the Samsung D8000 so you may considering getting help when mounting and/or lifting- Very thin display, looks very nice and practical when mounting in wall. The front look of the TV is very standard, nothing special about the frame or design except the screen which is matte avoiding distracting reflection.- The wii style remote control is really good specially when navigating thru apps menu (this is an unique feature vs others TV)- I had some issues connecting the TV to my network, after some tweaking, I was able to make it work.- Apps selection is very limited, but I found the ones that I was interested on (Amazon, Vudu and Netflix). Samsung, for instance, does not have Amazon yet. Navigation is simple and apps start very quickly, in fact Netflix start right in HD quality from the first second which is better than PS3 or Roku that usually take some few seconds to get full streaming speed...Now the most important for me, Video and sound quality:- Out of the box TV shows a very good image but still needs calibration to get to the best video reproduction.- Excellent color accuracy- For calibration, Color Management is the best I have seen...its give you full control of all the grey scale spectrum as well as each primary and secondary color adjustment... so if you want to do a deep calibration of this TV, can be easily done in less time than others.- After I calibrate the TV (leaving most of the TV video features off but local dimming on) the color looked very natural and balance in all video sources (DirecTV, PS3, etc).- Image looks a little bit soft (compare to the Samsung D8000)but it's not a major issue.- Black levels are excellent, very good screen uniformity considering this is a LED display, however, I have noticed in BD play there was a little white wave when only white with black background were present, but quickly went away and didn't bother me.- This TV is 120hz, the speed of video is ok although sometimes you can notice the lag of video speed when deal with fast pace images... (no different than other most expensive displays)- The sounds of this TV is probably slightly inferior to the average TVs, although it seems to be something linked with the TV firmware, after I updated the software, the sound came ok but still not at par to the best TVs.- 3D playback is Ok, not great but I'm not a big fan of watching 3d movies at home, the advantage of this type of passive technology is glasses are just plastic with no batteries. I do agree with many of the reviews that resolution in passive 3D is lower than active 3d TVs.Summary: if you want a nice size 55\" without paying 2K+ with excellent color accuracy while enjoy the thin and luminance of a LED display, this is the TV for you... if you don't care about luminance and you will be using the TV in low light room, you may also consider a plasma TV such as the Panasonic VT30 which will give you the best color accuracy and black levels but you have to deal with other issues that you may find when comparing LED vs Plasma.Hope this is helpful! I'm giving 4.5 stars (have to give 5 in amazon since they don't use decimals). I think for this price, this is the best TV you can buy in this range. Even compared to a more expensive model like the Samsung D8000 (you can check my review of that one too!), I would go with the LG.", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best TV ever!", "Author": "K.

We wanted to look at 55 inch Samsung, LG and Toshiba as we read decent reviews of each. Next was comparing models at Best Buy.  Closest to the door were the high end 3Ds. The two main displays for 3D were high end Panasonic and Sony active shutter tvs. I would say they were mildly impressive and after less than 5 minutes of viewing made our heads hurt. We continued our search for an LED tv. Samsung was the front runner. After we finished comparing two walls of 55inch tvs we still had not seen any LGs. On the opposite end side of the electronics was the LG display. One with and without 3D. We decided that the one without 3D was the best picture of all until we donned 3D glasses and watched Shrek in 3D on this tv. It was stunning! We didn't want to stop watching it. We then asked to see the 2D on this tv. Also the best picture of any 2D we had seen there. Best Buy had this priced at $1779.99. We ended up buying it here for $1449 with 10 pairs of glasses instead of 4 at Best Buy.Amazon had this shipped by CEVA. We set up the delivery time for 3 business days later (even though it should have been 2 with amazon prime....) between 1-4pm. At 3:50pm i checked the tracking to see what was going on and it showed the delivery date as the following day. I called customer service at CEVA who stated that it was still on schedule. A few minutes later I received a call from the driver who stated that he was about 45 minutes away and on the worst road (in regards to traffic) in the DC area at rush hour. They ended up being 2 hours late but my tv was in perfect condition so I shouldn't complain.It was very easy to set up. We adjusted all the settings to our own preferences. The 3D is so ridiculous I cannot believe I have this in my living room. HBO currently has Despicable Me on demand in 3D. I had already seen the movie but could not stop watching it because of how cool the 3D looked. I felt like a kid. I do advise on watching 3D in the dark as it enhances the effects. The passive shutter seems to be a lot easier on the eyes and head. I really don't understand why anyone would prefer active. I have not found anything yet that the 2D to 3D conversion has really worked for but I still try almost every new show or movie. The 2D HD is perfect. I couldn't ask for a better picture. This tv looks like it costs twice as much as what we paid. I can't wait to watch football tonight!We have played around with the Smart TV. Its pretty cool too. Very user friendly. Most You tube HD looks great (some were sub par)  We found that Amazon has rentals cheaper than ON demand but not as many 3D selections. Netflix only has a few streaming 3D movies. Because of this, I'm not in a hurry to get a 3D blu ray player. Hopefully for Christmas we'll get one and start our 3D movie collection.In conclusion, I cannot recommend a better TV.

Unfortunately, the TV sent to me sustained more than cosmetic damage.After struggling to get 5.1 (BluRay/Cable via HDMI to TV, Optical to Receiver) to my receiver I called LG, they walked me through as much as they could.  Then I called the Blu Ray manufacturer, they said its not their problem.  Called LG back, get someone quite friendly and he scheduled a home visit from an actual LG tech.  I described the problem, he said its probably a problem with the main board (oy!).  So I casually ask him, is this halo on the left side of the set normal?  It doesn't exist on the right side.  He says no, not at all, there is underlying damage here.  Which is what I suspected all along but I was trying to get used to it.  Imagine all the \"edge bleed\" other reviewers complain about and multiply by 100.  I told him don't bother with the repair, I'll just return it. So I called Amazon and arranged a return, bought a NEW set, same model.Aside from the damage and the edge bleeding I am very happy with this TV.  This is my first HDTV and first TV of this size, first 3D anything as well.  Everything has been great.  Discovering the \"soap opera\" effect was interesting and I figured out how to rid myself of it.  Honestly motion blur in the picture is normal and is comfortable to the eye.

But anyways, the TV looks amazing.  I plugged in the power cable and then connected my TW Cable box via HDMI.  In just a few seconds I was watching HD programming!  I upgraded from a 27-inch Sony behemoth so obviously any TV was going to look amazing by comparison.  But this TV looks spectacular... especially after I calibrated it using the CNET specs.I love the apps, especially mlb.tv, for which I already had a subscription.  I quickly visited the mlb.tv website (upon my TV's request) and was able to activate my account and watch any baseball game in HD.  Next I tried out Netflix and was amazed how easy it was to access all of their streaming content (either by search or their recommended selections).Next I tried out the \"magic motion\" remote, which I dub the \"wii remote\".  It works fine... not as responsive as the Wii remotes but you can pick up on it pretty easily.Finally, we tried out some 3D content via our TW Cable \"on demand\" content.  The passive glasses took about 2 minutes for my eyes to adjust to but after that point, no headaches.  Wonderful.Great TV, great value.

Passive 3D is definitely the way to go after seeing the LG in action.  The resolution is lower than active, but honestly I can't notice one bit watching 3D blu-rays...it looks like full 1080P to me.  I've tried out a few 3D movies...Resident Evil: Afterlife and Tangled.  The 3D performance is better than the theater in my opinion, and the colors really pop.  I caught myself ducking a few times...no kidding.So now you're wondering how is the 2D picture...phenomenal!  The colors pop right off the screen like only an LED can deliver.  And standard def dvds look better than ever as well.There are a multitude of picture setup options so everyone will be pleased, and it even has an auto picture mode (I believe it's called \"Intelligent sensor\") that adjusts your picture quality to match the room environment.  Pretty cool.  The SmartTV screen is really cool too.  It offers a lot of apps and web content which is a nice plus.  There is also a wifi dongle which you plug in the back so you don't even notice it from the front.Oh and don't let me forget the magic remote.  This set actually comes with 2 remotes...a normal one and a clever new invention called a magic remote, which kind of works like a Wii remote.  You can pretty much throw away the normal one because the magic remote is much more useful.  It makes getting around the menus a lot easier and quicker.  Very clever addition indeed.I do notice some minor \"flash lighting\" on the bottom corner of the screen, but it's really not too noticeable when viewing content.  I can't really comment on audio since I use my receiver.All in all I'm thoroughly impressed with this unit and can't say enough good things about it.

It wasn't consistent.  Sometimes it would be phenomenal and I would think it's fixed, but part way through a movie or TV show, it would start to fail lip sync.  This drives me nuts.

This is my first HD TV.  I find the following problems very frustrating:1. I use the Wireless Dongle that came with the TV to connect to my 802.11n 5Ghz wireless network.  The dongle is *always* plugged into the USB port of the TV.  Whenever the wireless AP/router is turned OFF and the TV is tuned to a HD channel, the screen pixelates severely and the audio is interrupted for about half a second *every 7 seconds* or so -- it's like a 7-second clock :(  I reported this to LG customer support and they are sending out a technician in about a week from now.  We'll see what happens...2. The other problem is that the built-in Netflix app's settings get corrupted frequently -- Netflix is the only paid service that I use with this TV, so don't know whether it's also a problem with the other apps.  I experience this problem at least once per week, if not more: when connecting to Netflix, the TV pops up a dialog prompting whether I have a Netflix subscription (don't remember the exact verbiage).  When I select Yes, it asks me to enter my email address and password (it's a pain to enter long/secure credentials with their user interface).  After entering the password, it tries to connect again, and then puts up a different error message informing me that it is having problems connecting to the Netflix service.  To fix this, I have to navigate to Options-->Setup-->\"SmartTV\"-->Reset, and reset the Netflix service; after this, I have to launch Netflix app and enter my email address and netflix password all over again.  Then it works fine for a day or a few days, but the problem recurs after that.  I discussed this with LG customer support with two separate agents: one was completely useless - he kept making up stories that the Netflix app is just like a web browser and that it's normal for it to forget the settings every time the TV is turned off; the other agent acknowledged that this is a know problem, but said that LG is *not* working on a fix for it :(3. The YouTube app on this TV is unusable with my 1.5 Megabit-per-second DSL service (1.5Mbps per DSL REPORTS; it's not the fastest DSL service, but good enough for YouTube to work fine on all other gadgets in the house).  The app constantly falls behind and constantly has to pause to re-buffer, even in non-full-screen mode!

This TV is used in our bedroom.  Comparing to our projection TV, which we paid like $3,000 about 15 year ago, this LED TV is incredibly thin, light weight, clear, sharp, and energy efficient. With Amazon's great deal and low price guarantee, it is also an incredible value too. I feel that even if you don't watch TV much, it still worths the while to jump into the technology bandwagon and experience the changes in the high tech world if you are an old timer.After I bought the TV, I bought a LG blueray 3D player, and a few 3D blueray DVDs.  This TV has a 2D to 3D conversion.  Basically, you can see anything in 3D, all the TV programs and all DVD movies.  You can also adjust the depth of the 3D effects.  Of course, if you want to view in 3D, you may want to adjust the depth to the greatest possible.  The difference between the 3D DVDs and the ordinary blueray DVDs in 3D conversion is that the images in the 3D DVDs can come out of the TV screen.  Whereas, the 3D converted images from 2D can only increase in depth into the TV.  However, the few 3D DVD movies I bought, although they have the highest rating at Amazon, have only a few seconds each with images popping of the TV, but cost much more than the ordinary DVDs.  The 3D of this TV is the passive system.  The pro is the light-weight non-expensive veiwing glasses.  The con is that the resolution is cut in half.  If you view good material sourcs, like blueray movies, you shouldn't feel much differnce.The package of this TV is very flimsy.  The edge of the TV is sharp (to make it looks more thin) and makes of plastic.  The first TV shipped to me was damaged on the edge.

Specifically, I routinely get \"initializing, try again later\" errors when trying to launch Netflix.  I'll also frequently see a \"configure networking\" button, even though my network is already configured, it just hasn't associated yet (on TV startup, connected via wireless dongle).Apps packaged with the TV also have bad interfaces.  It is nearly impossible to set the city I want for the weather app (lots of paging instead of search), and Netflix mixes vertical and horizontal navigation in a way that you frequently move too far to the left and undo your previous selections or searches.Also a minor nit (that didn't influence my rating) is that I accepted the GPL as part of my setup procedure, but I didn't find any source code on the CD-ROM that came with the TV.  I would expect the source or a link to appear somewhere when accepting the license or browsing the CD.Summary: because I use Netflix more frequently than 3D, and I can get a comparable 2D picture from other TVs, the home screen interface destroys my opinion more than the passive 3D can make up for.

Primary reasons- Size for the price point and passive 3D feature.  Product was shipped and delivered in timely fashion. Out of the box the picture is GREAT! Network set up was very simple. Connecting to my online services (Netflix & Amazon Prime) was a cinch. I have the unit hooked up to a Insigna home theater & Sony 3d Bluy-ray player both of which played nicely with my Sony TV. I have intermittent issues with the HDMI pass through not working properly when I try to operate the LG TV in the HDMI bypass mode. To solve the problem I have to turn the TV, receiver and U-verse DVR on and off until the TV picks up the HDMI signal(never had this issue with the Sony). I have also not been able to figure out how to get the energy saver mode to work correctly. Other that these issues I LOVE IT!I have this TV in a room with a full wall of windows. The combination of the screen brightness and the matte finish allows us to watch the TV in the middle of the day with very little glare.  Although I have only watched a couple of 3D movies, I am impressed with the passive 3D feature. The 2D to 3D feature is also is pretty cool but really works best with high quality HD broadcasts.The TV speakers are mediocre at best but not an issue when attached to home theater.

I ended up contacting customer support about that issue late one night and before I woke up the next morning the had emailed me with the number for ceva to make sure my number had been changed, it ended up not mattering though because I got an email from ceva for me to call and set up a delivery date myself when the TV had arrived.  I had read alot of bad reviews about ceva and had a mixed experience with their customer service but ended up setting up a delivery for last tuesday, they said they had to go through portland freight in maine for the rest of the delivery which was fine.  The delivery guy showed up about a half hour after the 4 hour window that ceva had given me but he called in advance to let me know.  The delivery driver was amazing! He completely set up my tv (attached stand and cables) and put it where I wanted it and even stayed to make sure all the inputs worked!  I was extremely impressed by how friendly he was and how careful he was when setting everything up.

My wife and I were impressed with the picture quality and the 3D demo that we saw convinced me to go ahead and order it from Amazon (of course, since it's the lowest price out there + free shipping).After a few days, the unit arrived and setting it up was a breeze EXCEPT for one thing: I couldn't get the wifi connection going. TV was in the family room downstairs and the wireless router was in the computer room upstairs. Laptop has 3 bars at where the TV is and no problem connecting to the internet. Hmm... 'flaky' wifi receiver? So I went ahead and temporarily moved the router next to the TV and was able to connect successfully. So I decided to replace my old Buffalo AirStation with a longer range router, a brand new TP-Link WR1043N (also ordered from Amazon). With the new router, Netflix was now doable but STILL WITH rebuffering and video quality issues. Now, what to do? I got a Panasonic DMP-BD210 3D BD player with an integrated wifi. With this player, I can watch movies from Netflix and Amazon Prime without the problems we experience with the TV's wifi.This unit would have been a keeper (full HD picture quality, 2D-3D rendering, light passive 3D glasses, etc.) but another unacceptable function was audio: very tinny sound from the built-in speakers.

I replaced a still-working LC-42SB45U 42\" 1080p 1920 x 1080 2000:1 LCD TV. I received the item right on time. The delivery person unboxed it, plugged it in, and verified that it powered on. That evening, I connected my devices to it without problem. I watched a couple of hours of programming and explored some of the TV's features. The next morning, it worked for about an hour before the screen went black in the middle of a show. I could turn it on and the LG splash screen (with the logo, \"Life's good,\" and the clock) would display, then it would immediately go back to a black screen. When that happened, the screen was as dark as it was when the TV was off. The power light was white to indicate that the unit was on, and it flickered when it received signal from either remote, but the TV remained unresponsive.Before arranging a return to Amazon, I called LG. I was on hold for 22 minutes before their automated system hung up on me. I didn't even have a chance to speak to a representative. I also sent an email to which they never replied. The next day, my wife was finally able to speak to someone who told her that there were no techs in the area and that they would call back in 3 to 5 days. They never did.Because this TV is no longer sold by Amazon itself (only directly from third-party sellers or from third-party sellers and fulfilled by Amazon), I was only able to return it for refund, not for exchange. Exchange would have been my first choice. I thought long and hard about keeping it and giving LG a chance to do the repair, but the wait and their terrible customer service gave me pause. Plus, I have no way of knowing how this set would have held up in the long run. It could have been one repair followed by years of enjoyment or it could have been one repair followed by another repair followed by another repair (i.e. the TV might have been a lemon).So, I've decided to go with the Toshiba 55TL515U 55-inch Natural 3D 1080p 240 Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Net TV, Black after all.PROS (best I could tell)* Low price* Thin screen* Wi-Fi dongle included and connecting to my network was very easy* The two remotes* Low power consumption* 2D-to-3D conversion was niceCONS* TV failed to function almost immediately.* LG customer support is poor.* Wait time for needed repair may be long.* Matte screen is better than a glossy screen but has a prismatic glare. I added a picture to the item description that illustrates this.* LG apps seem okay but, due to my slower DSL connection, I ran into quite a bit of pausing when watching sample 3D videos. It would be ideal if buffer time could be increased. This may not be a problem for those with faster connections.* The Intelligent Sensor dimmed the screen too much when room lighting was low or off. This may be adjustable, but I didn't have an opportunity to find out.Others have had much better experiences with this TV, and I'm happy for them.

While I still like my new LG 55\" TV a lot, I just regret that I have listened to the market campaign on LED TV. It is real sad that the LED TV is just nowhere compared with plasma TV when it comes to image quality (even LED of now against plasma of 4 years ago).I could not believe that I made such a big mistake since I had browsed so many TV's prior to my purchase. So I went back to the brick store where I bought the LG from. I realize that all plasma TV.s were positioned to show the glare from its gloss surface while all LCD (and LED) were facing each other. The matted surface of LCD supposedly reduces the glare. But, it creates a background light right at the surface. You don't notice as much in the showroom because, in the dark scenes, all TV's are dark and don't reflect light to each others. The manufacturers can fool us by showing fantastic dynamic contract of millions to 1, but it does not matter unless  you watch TV in completely darkness. The matte surface diffuses the ambient light, which creates an unintended effect: a flat image. You will not see this when seeing the bright scenes such as sports. But, for movies and most of TV programs, it is just very disappointing to see the leakage of LED backlight and the diffused ambient light.Further, the standard color balance is overwhelming bluish. The manufacturers do this to make the TV's appearing bright. The is because LED's are more efficient to produce cool white (bluish) than warm white(reddish). After a proper adjustment of color balance, the TV loses its brightness a lot. However, you will have to do this if you have a plasma TV in your house to remind you what color really means. Unfortunately, you can not notice this problem in the showroom because all TV's are tuned to cool white to compete for attention (brighter).Feature-wise, LG55LW5600 is unmatched by competitions. LG had integrated the internet features better than others and has more creative ideas. The magic wand remote control is worth the money. While 3D overall is a gimmick of TV industry to make you pay more money, $50 premium is justified because you can show off your TV of latest technology to your unfortunate house guests who go through a series of dizzy 3D test with you. The truth is that, young or old, nobody can survive 3D Avartar. The 3D adds nothing to a good movie, other than dizziness. Therefore, I said it is worth $50 since you won't use it twice to watch movies.My conclusion is: LG55LW5600 is the top model of all LED TV's in the market with the most affordable price. But, if you watch high quality movies at night as your primary usage, you have no option except buying a plasma TV.  I gives it 3 stars for missing the most important requirement for a TV :image quality.

The color and clarity cannot be beat. The 3D effect can be a bit dizzying on true 3D. The 2D to 3D effect does not make us dizzy, and frankly blows me away with how good it looks.There are two issues, though, that LG needs to address. First, it will not pass Dolby sound signals from connected devices to your A/V receiver. Second, despite its TrueMotion adjustments, images that move laterally across the screen show a ghosted image.About the first issue, we connected an LG Blu-ray player and DirecTV HD-DVR to the TV using HDMI cables. Sadly, it would not pass through the Dolby signal from these devices, through the TV, to the A/V receiver.I called LG customer service, and was informed the pass-through feature was not built into this TV. However, over-the-air programs that have a Dolby signal will pass to the A/V receiver. This lack of engineering is a shame, because the solution proved to be very expensive for us.Here is how this got very expensive. The TV has a number of HDMI inputs on the back that easily handle our devices. I guess the intention was to use the TV inputs as a junction box. So, because the Dolby signals do not pass through, we tried connecting our devices directly to the A/V system (vintage 2004) using digital optical cables. Bad move. This produced yet another issue, with the picture lagging significantly behind the sound. Obviously, that would not work for us (nor, I assume, would it for you).If you have an older A/V system, you will likely also have to buy a new A/V system that adjusts for the lag. We did so, and the problem went away. However, that solution cost us about $500. Of course, we went for a good A/V system (Yamaha RX-V671BL), one with upgrade capabilities built in. You, however, might get away with one for about $250.Sadly had LG spent another $10 to $100 on the set (not sure what it would cost) to pass-through the Dolby, our old A/V system would have worked just fine. Goodness knows, they would have saved us an extra, significant expense.The bottom line for you is simple. Whatever price you pay for this TV, if you have an  older A/V system that does not adjust for lag, you will have to tack on at least another $250 for an A/V system that does.The second issue concerns ghosting. It is particularly annoying, especially when watching as much sports as we do. We tried adjusting it as directed in the manual, but had no success. The good news is, as suggested by another reviewer, if you turn OFF TruMotion, things improve significantly. About 99.5% of the drift goes away. Crazy, huh?In summary, the picture image is stunningly crisp, clear, and colorful. To say the least, the 3D is mind-blowing and, really, disarming. However, if LG had left out the TruMotion system and, instead, put in pass-through for all manner of Dolby signals for peripheral devices, I would give this set 5 stars. Because they didn't, and because I had to spend hundreds of dollars more to fix the sound-lag issue (update: and the Web browser issues I talk about in an update below), I can only give it 2.5 stars.Update: Here is another huge problem if you buy this TV with surfing the Web in mind. The browser has Flash 8. That means any content beyond Flash 8 will not play: you know, like just about everything left on the Web. Also, it will not access HTML5.What does this mean? It means the Web browser is almost obsolete. As I understand it, LG has no plans on updating it. Had I known this, there is no way we would now own this TV.

Sucha s the hx929 or the st50.  So now I ahd to come back to this mdoel tot ry again.The settings I am using are the CNET ones.  The picture is very dull and lifeless when using them.  And in game mode, where companies usually exaggerate the look to have it stand out more, it STILL looks bad.  I can ignore it for games, but for movies I want a tv to look good.I doubt it's the CNET settings themselves because I sue CNET settings on all of these numerous tvs I've tried and this is the only model of tv which has looked truly bad with them.I'm hoping someone will have ideas, but I really doubt they can have any.  Trying other settigns to make it lok \"better\" will then have it not look realistic because it's unlikely to randomly change settigns and magically end up with ones which would measure realistically.As far as game mode, yeah a lot of issues there as well.  I set it to PC, have the latest firmware, and put it in game mode.  I was playing rock band 3, so I can change the in-game calibration top help with lag.  But I am still not getting it right.  It's \"ok\" enough to enjoy the game, but missing quite a few notes which I shouldn't.  I don't think LAG is the whole story.  i think when it comes to video games motion must also be coming into effect.  I don't think the notes are moving fluidly and that is complicating lag even more where when things mvoe fast it screws up the lag worse.Just really coems down to picture quality though.  I'm really baffled as to how so many people rate this a 4 or 5 when it has the worst picture of tons of tvs i ahve tried, including even entry level CCFL sets.  I hope I figure out somethign to make it look right, or else my only real other chocie is keep the sony ex500 CCFL ((not the CCFL I was referring to), whichs till bothers my head some, probably due to the glossy look of the picture.I am glad this is not glossy, but that alone is not what's making it look bad!

I hooked both the xbox and ps3 to a 1.4 hdmi cable direct to tv.  Played Killzone 2, Alice Madness returns, and some COD Black ops.  Tried every gaming option-  Game mode, all post-processing adjustments off, all of them on, labeled the input as \"PC\", etc...Video game movement was just too blurry.  Turning Trumotion on helped with the blurriness but introduced bad lag.Clouding.  I had it in the lower right corner about a 6\" radius, and along the right side in the middle along the edge.  Adjusting my viewing angle did not help.  Saw this every time a movie would fade to black.Is it me or do LG's have Audio/video syncing issues?

I recommend trying it out from a brick & mortar store so returns are easy.BTW, after returning the tv, I went back to best buy and tried the Samsung active 3d.  Putting the glasses on and watching Shrek 3D gave me immediate eye strain.  Tried the Panasonic and there was no eye strain. The best buy employee did not experience any eye strain.  It's different for everybody.I suffer from migrains about once every 6-8 months for the past 5 years. (I get the flashing lights, nausea, etc) I had 2 migraines three days apart this week, all when I was looking at these tv's.  I cannot guarantee that it was the tv's but the headaches mimicked the strain I felt behind my eyes when I demo'd the Samsung.Pros:cheap lightweight glasses that do not need charging.Great looking 3D picture.Slim, nice looking cabinet.Good overall picture, way too many configurable options (Picture adjustments and \"AV mode\"?)App store is cool, and tapping into my PC to browse music and pictures is great, however a little clunky.", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware!

If you really cant resist the price I would say go to Best Buy or HHgreg ,someplace like that to see what the pic looks like with a football game on. It's mind boggling the way the TV pic quality just waves goodbye when watching NFL games, could it be a secret plot by Sony?? All NFL games use sony cameras for the broadcast video or could Dishnetwork be the culprit?? I have no idea all I know is I cant stand watching NFL games on my brand new TV. I dont know about you but for me it's a big deal.Yes I have an HD box and even tried a different HD box", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "3D tv", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "R3DXOY1O1HJVLG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The TV only came with 6 pairs of glasses but the promotion was for 8 pairs can this be fixed, other wise the TVs great", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "PO'ed", "Author": "Don", "ReviewID": "R59RNQGNVGZZI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Love the tv, except the sound.

Nothing that effects the unit itself but was very disappointed that it was there.  Thought I'd notify Amazon and LG to make sure all bases were covered in case the chip for some reason turned into a crack.  (which it shouldn't)  LG was decent about it and got back to me right away, said they were forwarding it to the upper management people.
