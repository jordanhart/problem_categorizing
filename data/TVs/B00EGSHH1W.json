{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sansui SLED2900 29\" LED TV", "Author": "Mark L Mallard", "ReviewID": "R1AOQLT2KSG52B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was on the lookout for a 26-29\" TV and since I already own LG and Philips TVs I started doing my research with those companies, as well as Samsung. I wanted a fairly thin one as well since it was going to be wall-mounted.  I'd settled on one, but hesitated ordering it because when it comes to visual type products I wanted to be able to see it in action.  Except for one local furniture store that also carries some electronics there aren't many choices beyond Walmart, so I thought I'd go see what they had.  Not only did the 29\" Sansui's picture win me over I also bought its little sister -- a 19\" (SLED1980) for our kitchen! These TVs beat out all three brands I mentioned above since I was able to view them all side-by-side.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EGSHH1W"}}
