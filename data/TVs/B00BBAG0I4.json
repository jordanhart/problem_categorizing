{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sooooo close....", "Author": "Gaz Rendar", "ReviewID": "RIEU9CJVR4XA8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The LG 42GA6400 is a mixture of solid performance and underdeveloped promise.  At the time of this review (May 2013), the 42GA6400 is a 4-star television.  I put that disclaimer up front because I firmly believe that some thoughtful software fixes could definitely bump this TV up to 5-stars.HARDWAREI'll start with the physical specifications of the television first.  Assembly of the stand is pretty typical for LCD sets, and I had no problem attaching the 8 screws required to get the TV in an upright position by myself.  I would have preferred a base with a standard X pattern, but the two \"arms coming out to hug you\" stand is stable enough and doesn't take up a huge footprint.  It's somewhat of a bummer, but the stand lacks a tilt/rotation capability.  There are 4 HDMI inputs on the side of the TV, a headphone output, an optical out, USB inputs, and some 1/8\" jacks that allow you to plug in composite and component in cables via the supplied adapters.  There is an additional 1/8\" jack for the IR blaster adapter (also supplied--it's a Y-adapter with two IR blasters connected to the same jack).  There is also a coax cable input for direct standard cable signal or an over-the-air antenna.  The 3-prong, grounded power cord is attached to the opposite side of the TV from the inputs.  Unfortunately, I feel like the power cord could be a good 1-2 feet longer.  The frame is about an inch in each direction around the screen, and is made of a pretty slick, metallic-looking gray plastic.PICTUREThe 42 inch panel on this TV holds up well against similar $750-900 competition (obviously scale up the cost on 47-55 inch models).  It's a full 1080p LED backlit screen.  There is no microdimming from the LEDs, and as a result the best black it can produce is a dark, dark gray.  I didn't have any issues with lighting bleed around the bezel or at the edge of the screen.  Still, the black levels and contrast are consistent with panels in this price range.  You'll have to drop another couple hundred to get better contrast.  I do find the color reproduction to be very good compared to similarly priced sets.  Reds and greens have an appropriate amount of saturation, but due to the limited dynamic contrast the overall picture just lacks a little bit of vibrancy.  I watched NBA and NHL playoffs on the set, and I was pleasantly surprised with the ability of the 120Hz refresh to keep up with most of the action.  Hockey still had some noticeable digital motion blur, but by no means was it bad.  Overall, the screen slightly exceeded my expectations for this price range.3DI don't watch much 3D because content is limited and there are rarely any live sporting events that transmit a 3D signal.  This LG comes with 4 pairs of passive 3D glasses (similar to the glasses you get in a movie theatre).  Since my 3D options are somewhat limited, I fired up Green Lantern in 3D (yes, I know the movie is awful) and put on the glasses.  Wow.  For a TV the 3D effect was solid and I never experienced any cross-signal.  The 3D viewing angle isn't that wide, but you can maintain a quality depth effect if you're sitting 30-45 degrees away from straight-on.  Again, I was surprised that I wound up preferring this passive 3D effect over my active-shutter 3D glasses I use with my Samsung ES7500.  It's also nice that you don't have to worry about putting batteries in the glasses as well.REMOTEIf you're reading this review the reason you're considering this TV is because it's a Google TV.  Well, really, the GoogleTV software goes hand-in-hand with this iteration of the LG magic remote.  LG made an incredible remote for this TV, however, they also annoyed me to no end by not going the extra mile and including a couple simple, intuitive features.  First, the good...the keyboard works great and is so much better than trying to type out search phrases in a SmartTV with a D-pad.  The pointer works very well.  It's basically a poor-man's version of a Wiimote.  Some of the features, like holding down the gesture button and air-drawing semi-circles to zoom in can be next to useless, but for the majority of the GoogleTV interface this remote is a wonderful match.  Unfortunately, the remote has problems whenever I try to use my Comcast DVR.  There are times when I want to use my DVR's channel guide (see below) and unfortunately, this remote does NOT have page up and page down buttons.  This problem could be alleviated if LG can fix the firmware and allow a single click of the scroll wheel down to send a \"page down\" signal to the DVR through the IR blaster.  The other issue is that, amazingly, there is no STOP button.  There is a separate play and a separate pause button, but no stop.  Why not make one button PLAY/PAUSE and the other button STOP?  When I'm watching DVR video I need the stop button to get me out of the program I'm watching and give me the option to delete it.  Instead, all I can do is pause, and then hit BACK, which takes me all the way out of the DVR menu structure.  It's annoying.  Buried within the menus is the ability to assign functions to the red, yellow, green, and blue buttons, but I tried to assign this page up and down functions and it didn't work.  There is a lot of empty space on the front of the remote.  Why didn't LG add a couple more buttons for page up/down and stop...and even 0-9 while they're at it?GOOGLE TVObviously, this is the differentiator for this set.  If you ask me is it worth paying roughly an extra $100 over a competitive panel with the same picture quality to have GoogleTV built-in, my answer as of May 2013 would be---not yet.  Hopefully some software and firmware updates will soon change that answer to a definitive YES.  Basically, GoogleTV tries to interact with your DVR and essentially overlay its interface on top of DVR's interface and cable (or satellite) signal.  When you start up your GoogleTV, you are required to log in with a Google account.  Not a fan of Google's privacy policies?  Too bad.  The main thing is that your account gives you access to the Google store so that you can load up your TV with apps.  Once you're logged in, you calibrate the TV to the type of TV signal you receive, what area you're in, and whether or not your receive premium channels.  From there it takes a few minutes to load, but GoogleTV takes over and provides you with its channel guide.  The GoogleTV channel guide is similar to Apple's cover flow for music.  Instead of seeing a common spreadsheet grid from your DVR, you instead thumb through mini-images of movie and TV show posters.  At first glance, it seems like a much more intuitive way to find content.  However, it only works well for live TV and shows that are going to start within 5 minutes or so.  You won't see shows that are going to begin in an hour.  On a normal DVR channel grid, I can flick around and see that a program will come on an hour from now.  I can either record it or plan to watch it.  With GoogleTV, you are instead supposed to know what you want to watch and use the keyboard or voice search to find it.  The search will find it on upcoming TV listings, Netflix, Amazon Video, YouTube, etc.  The difference is that you have to know what you are looking for ahead of time.  While using GoogleTV, a double press of the Guide button will send you to the DVR channel grid, but without the aforementioned page up/down buttons navigating is an imprecise chore.  The TV has a 2-hour sleep feature to keep its content up-to-date.  If you shut off the TV and come back and hour later you won't miss a beat.  If you shut off the TV and return the next day, it can take 30 seconds to 5 minutes for the Guide to update and be ready to use.The GooglePlay app store is...weird.  Within the app store I can click GAMES and I'm taken to a page that shows featured items, or editor's picks.  Except that there are zero, and I literally mean zero apps on these pages.  It's as if the store is empty.  However, if I search within the store for \"solitaire,\" I'm given the option to download a game that works on the TV.  Once again, you need to know exactly what you're looking for.  There are a very limited number of apps, though.  I believe the problem is that GoogleTV is running a variant of Android 3.2 instead of the 4.X running on most phones and tablets for 2012-2013.  I have no idea if an upgrade to 4.X will provide more apps.  Of the apps that are there, it's a somewhat mixed bag.  The internet browser is amazingly not horrible for a TV, thanks in large part to the keypad remote with scroll wheel and Wii-like pointer.  I had a difficult time with streaming services, though.  Short YouTube clips worked well, but AmazonPrime had a rough start.  At first, I searched for \"Justified,\" and Google directed me to an option to watch free season 2 episodes via my Amazon Prime subscription.  Great!  UGH...except that streaming was unwatchable with constant buffering pauses in HD and even in SD.  After taking 21 minutes to watch the first 10 minutes of the show because of horrible buffering lag, I shut off the TV, fired up my Samsung ES7500 (which was positioned right next to this LG) and was able to stream the same episode from the same source, in HD, with no lag.  I was going to post my review last week and drop it another star, but just recently there was an update that dramatically improved the performance.  I still had 4 buffering incidents in a 1-hour long show, but it was at least watchable now.  It gives me hope that a few more software/firmware updates will really improve this TV.SUMMARYOverall, the LG 42GA6400 is a competitive TV in the $750-900 price range (scale the 47-55 inch units appropriately).  The picture is solid and the hardware looks good.  The remote is one step away from being one of the best gadgets of the year, but the lack of just a couple buttons is a mind-blowing admission.  The software has some cool advantages with its image-based content scrolling, but it's still too limited in its current form.  If Google can update the software to Android 4.X (rumored to happen late summer 2013), offer ways to stumble onto TV programs without me needing to know exactly what I want to watch, and if LG can provide some new firmware to improve WiFi streaming and perhaps assign more functions to the colored remote buttons--we might have a 5-star winner here.  But until that time, the functions fall just short.  You're still getting a good set; it's just not the magical TV experience I was hoping for.(If Google/LG push out significant upgrades I'll try to update this review).UPDATEThere's been some minor updates to the OS and several apps.  The Google Play store now lists a few featured apps under the headings (instead of nothing), but apps are still woefully underrepresented.  There is no Hulu app, nor is there an Xfinity app.  And HBO GO is incompatible with this GoogleTV.  I wanted to catch up on Game of Thrones, but the app just sends to you the Chrome browser-based website and nothing loads. I doubt HBO GO gets fixed until (if?) GoogleTV gets updated to Android 4.X.X.  On the bright side, Amazon Prime is working much smoother than before, and the Zillow app with the magic remote is really fantastic if you're house hunting.2ND UPDATEThe second gen Google TVs from LG just got updated to an Android 4.2.2 variant in the past week.  The update took about 15 mins to download and install.  The GooglePlay store has a few more apps available when you open it, but Hulu Plus and HBO GO are still missing at the moment (end of Oct 2013).  However, with the new update in place, I have much greater hope that we'll see better apps coming soon to this device.", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bitter Sweet Purchase - REVISED to ROCKIN

Processor. The Picture is AMAZING!!! 2D - 3D works very well, and the 3D is clear as a bell. This is by far the best video ever produced on an LCD. Again.. AmazingNOW, for the Bitter part!There is something wrong with the OS. The Buttons on the remote will pull up the Guide, but it immediately shuts down. The Voice Search will record your search, but then shut down immediately after finding the results, same with the app store and any other apps it runs. The menu is shows lines next to the icon and will change from place to place, no issue with the actual screen, just the code for the OS.All in all, the purchase was bitter sweet to say. I have contacted LG and they are going to send someone out to look at it. Hopefully they will find the issue and resolve it or replace the set. I will update the post after their visit, or delete and re-post.*** REVISED Update****OK Folks, here is what you have wanted to hear.My TV was replaced by Amazon. I contacted their support and they shipped out a new TV the day I called, it was received the next day. It works just fine, and everything is wonderful. The features are just as expected. The Dual Play is a great feature as I am a console gamer and it makes a huge difference having the full screen to see and not just a portion of it. Netflix, HBOGo, Etc open without any error, and again the picture using the apps is greatness. I cannot tell you how much this TV rocks.  What many people don't mention is the \"Spotlight\" app. I fond in there many sites that are formatted for the Google TV. It was a big surprise to me. If there is anyone out there with any doubts about this TV you should put them to rest right now. The screen is reflective, and I have a lot of ambient light that shines in the room, but the set is so bright that there is no issue.I LOVE THIS TV!!!", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "WEBTV Reinvented . . . .", "Author": "Sunday \"SundayAtDusk\"", "ReviewID": "R22I294OJRVOF5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Unless you need  someone like the Geek Squad to set up your new TV, buying one from Amazon is the way to go!  Shipping is free, and the UPS guy will bring this TV right into your house and set it in your foyer, or which ever room is by your front door.  You have to sign for the TV, too.  UPS isn't going to just leave it on your front porch.  I was surprised to see it only took one man to carry a 42\" TV.  But it is thin, only an inch thick.  The box itself is only six inches wide. Thus, even though I am a petite female, I had no trouble sliding it across the floor and carpet to the den, and no trouble sliding it out of the box, lifting the screen up to the couch, and attaching the stand that takes eight screws.  I could also lift it up a few inches and carry it across the floor, after attaching the stand, since it all weighs under 40 pounds, but I did not dare try to lift it any higher by myself.  Still yet, obviously the 42\" has become the new 32\"!My interest in this LG Google TV was twofold.  One, when I started on the internet 13 years ago, I started with WEBTV.  For me, the internet was a leisurely activity where you were comfortably seated, looking at a big screen.  Surfing the web was not a desk and chair activity involving a little computer monitor.  It was a sad day when my WEBTV stopped working with Cox's telephone lines.  Of course, now you can easily use a flat screen TV as a PC monitor; but it's just not the same as using WEBTV or Google TV, and having a remote control that controls everything.  Two, like many people, I have an elderly mother who was thrilled to learn that two of her favorite soap operas, that were cancelled by ABC last year, were returning.  That is, she was thrilled until she learned they were coming back via the internet.  She does not use a computer, and probably never will even try, even though she does express interest at times in doing so.  Hence, I saw this LG TV with Google TV as possibly a way of finally getting her online, and having those two soaps on the internet was going to be the big motivation to do so.  Or at least I was going to show her how she could watch her soaps again, and that she might consider getting a Sony NSZ-GS7 Internet Player with Google TV for her older flat screen Sony TV.Then, I discovered one of the few problems with this TV.  Actually, it's a problem with Google TV--Hulu Plus is blocked on Google TV, as are the websites for the major networks, like ABC.com.  Unfortunately, Hulu is the only place where the soaps are shown, except for iTunes, which looks like a much more expensive endeavor.  So, all of you out there in Soap Opera Land looking for a way to watch \"All My Children\" and \"One Life To Live\", a Google TV is not the TV to get, unless you want to hook up your PC to the TV, or invest in something else to allow you to watch the soaps on a Google TV.  You need to get a Smart TV like the LG Electronics 42LA6200 42-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 120Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV and Four Pairs of 3D Glasses.  Or a Roku box like the Roku 3 Streaming Player to use with the TV you already own.  Fortunately, I already had a Roku 3400R Streaming Stick  (Purple) that came with the 3M Streaming Projector Powered by Roku (SPR1000).  When testing it out with this TV, I just happened to put it in the one HDMI port that would support it--the fourth port that says MHL.  The Roku stick works flawlessly with this LG TV.  But that's not what LG was thinking when they included the MHL port; it's actually for hooking up MHL-enabled cell phones, so \"digital audiovisual signals\" can be transmitted.The only other problem I encountered with this LG is when I connected it to Cox cable, while only using the line from the wall, not the cable box.  The problem with that is that Cox still has analog channels, as well as digital channels, for the major networks.  And if you use the channel button on the remote to go to a major network channel, it takes you to the analog one, not the digital one.  Pushing the channel button again should obviously take you to the digital one, since the analog channel would be, for example 13, and the digital one would be 13-1.  But it does not.  Actually, using the channel button takes you to only a fraction of the channels.  Using the voice command on the remote control gives you the same problem.  If you say either \"ABC\" or the number for ABC in your area, it takes you to the analog channel.  However, if you use the number buttons on the keyboard side of the remote, you will go to the digital channel.  For example, if you press 13, you will go to the digital channel 13-1, not the analog channel 13. You will also see a drop down menu on the screen when you reach 13-1, with other choices of other places you can choose to go to, if 13-1 was not the channel you wanted.  This matter may be trivial to many viewers.  It is to me.  But others, including elderly viewers, may have problems with the matter, since the keys on the keyboard side of the remote are very small.  They are always very accurate when you push them, but they are still very small.Also, probably the majority of people who have cable use cable boxes.  At first, I didn't think the little connection cords included with this LG TV would even fit the huge Cox cable box connection cords, but they did.  Just make sure when you connect the included yellow and green composite video cables, you hear them click into place on the back of the TV.  There were no problems with channel selections using the cable box, but, of course, you have to use your cable box remote, unless you set up the included IR blaster cord.  What the IR blaster cord does is allow you to use the LG remote to change channels while using the cable box.  The directions for setting up the IR blaster in the included paper owner's manual, as well as on the TV screen, were very simple to follow.  Basically, you just place the sensors on your cable box, choose your cable provider and cable box manufacturer from lists on the screen, and then try out a few codes.  It was a simple process, but unfortunately it did not work for me.  Either LG didn't have the correct code for my Magnavox cable box, or I set up the sensors wrong, which seemed unlikely since there were two sensors, instead of one as shown in the users manual.  I may pursue the matter with LG.  (I already e-mailed them once with a question, which I later figured out myself.  They e-mailed me back in less than 24 hours, and said to please call them, and they would forward my call to the technical person I needed to talk to about the matter.)Now, on to all that is right things about this LG TV:Set-Up:  It was simple and fast to set up the TV.  Set-up starts when you turn it on for the first time.  First, the TV channels are discovered, and then it goes on to the internet connection.  It quickly discovered my network, and I just had to type in my network password, so the connection between the router and TV was secured.  At the present time, the TV is in the same room as my Linksys EA4500 App-Enabled N900 Dual-Band Wireless-N Router with Gigabit and USB, so there are obviously no signal problems.  To use Google TV you must have or create a Google (gmail) account, which you can do on the TV or on your computer.Remote Control:  I was truly impressed by the voice command feature on the remote.  I guess because I knew no one who had a voice remote or wanted one, I thought it was a novelty type item.  It's actually very accurate and useful.  You just push the voice button on the front of the remote, and say where you want to go.  You can say a channel number or a channel name (i.e. ABC, TV Land, Fox) and off you go to those channels.  If it doesn't understand what you said, it tells you that on the screen.  Giving internet commands is even more accurate.  Saying \"amazon.com\" takes you to Amazon's home page, saying \"google.com\" takes you to Google's search page, saying \"msn.com\" or \"yahoo.com\" takes you to their home pages, saying \"live.com\" takes you to the Outlook/Hotmail/Live mail sign-in page, etc.  (If you say \"Hulu\" it takes you to a website called Lulu. :)  A mouse arrow button is also on the front of the remote and the arrow is a bit jumpy, but not too jumpy.  On the back of the remote is a glorious computer keyboard.  I am no fan of small keyboards and I don't text, but I got use to the little Google TV keyboard right away.  As I stated earlier in the review, it's very accurate.  There are two excellent picture instruction pages on the remote in the excellent owner's manual.Adding Keyboards & Mice:  Of course, a full size keyboard will work best for some of the things you'll want to do on Google TV.  I plugged in my Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 6000 USB plug into one of the USB ports on the back of the TV, and it worked instantly.  The same with a very old wireless mouse that came with a USB wired base.  That surprising worked instantly, too. (The 6000 mouse had a premature death.)  Probably the best keyboards to use for Google TV are the Logitech ones--Logitech Keyboard Controller for Logitech Revue and Google TV and Logitech Wireless Touch Keyboard K400 with Built-In Multi-Touch Touchpad (920-003070).  Both have a touch pad on the keyboard, so you need no mouse or the mouse arrow on the remote.Google TV;  There is obviously lots to learn about Google TV that I don't know.  I just wish I had a manual on it, or wish there was a \"Google TV For Dummies\" book, which unfortunately there is not.  (The first Dummies book I ever read was WebTV For Dummies (For Dummies (Computers)).)Picture & Sound & 3D:  I think both the picture and sound are excellent, but I'm no expert on those matters.  It looks great and sounds great to me.  You can, of course, hook up a speaker system, and there is a headphone jack in the back of the TV.  (Not the best place for a headphone jack, mind you.)  I was not that much interested in 3D viewing, especially after reading all the warnings in the owner's manual about it.  (According to the manual, some 3D viewers may \"experience a seizure\" or experience the following symptoms:  \"Headache, eyeball pain, dizziness, nausea, palpitations, blurriness, discomfort, double image, visual inconvenience or fatigue\".  Also, some children may get so excited by 3D viewing that they try to jump into the screen, and children under the age of five are \"prohibited\" from watching 3D.)  But I decided to be brave and watch a 3D episode on meerkats that was in the 3D section on the home page.  As it turned out, watching a wildlife documentary in 3D was absolutely wild! The only thing I fear now about 3D viewing is that all non-3D wildlife shows that I watch in the future are going to seem so flat. (And I could just see a kid trying to reach into the screen and grab a meerkat!  I think TV internet is perfect for kids, though; you'll always be able to clearly see what they are doing online on a 42\" screen.)My Elderly Guinea Pig:  I've got my mother watching her soaps last weekend, and she was very happy with it all.  She could control the play and pause buttons on the front of the remote, which are very small, as remote controls go.  There are also fast forward and reverse buttons that go forward and backwards 15 minutes each time you press the button.  (You can't use them to avoid commercials on Hulu Plus, however.)  A Roku streaming stick is not the best thing for an elderly viewer, however.  I'm not sure it is suppose to be left in the MHL port when not being used, so the stick would have to be put in and taken out each time it was used.  When the stick is inserted, a box pops up about it, and all you have to do is push the enter button to get to Roku, but that may be confusing to some elderly people.  If the Roku stick is left in the MHL port, you have to push the input button on the remote and scroll down to the MHL input, which would possibly be even more confusing.  On my mother's older Sony TV, she just has to keep pushing the input button until what she wants to view appears on the TV screen.  All in all, I don't think the LG Google TV remote is the best one for the elderly, except for the voice command feature, but I'm sure there are those who would have no problem with it, and I know I certainly think it's a terrific remote control.I think this whole LG TV is terrific and Google TV is terrific, too.  My WEBTV days are back, and those were my most fun days using the internet.

Takes a bit to get used to the google TV, lots of options, but its pretty impressive. I like the remote, When you're working with apps has a wii like function to move the cursor around the screen by moving the remote(you can also use directional buttons) has a good keyboard on back. Loving the PIP feature where I can be in a google TV app but still watch TV. I \"cut\" the cord (well have basic cable now) and Google chrome (web browser) works great and I can watch allot of videos (including flash based) like HGTV (wife) and the Daily show. Also have amazon prime, so I can stream allot of shows for free (has netflix too, but no Hulu on any google tv)Comes with 2 IR blasters to control your cable box (if you have one, has built in OTA tuner) and AV equipment. I have a Tivo for DVR (Google TV right now has no DVR abilities but can control DVR's with IR blaster) and the TV controls it pretty good (see below)Added an external 200gb HD to the USB port on the TV. Can store apps and media files on it (had to format it Fat32, use FAT32-Format windows application). Most apps can also access my NAS to play media.Apps from google play store:Vimu player, plays every file I throw at it.Mizuu a media center like app that will look @ all your files and download info about the movie/shows, along screen art and put it in a very eye pleasing way.Mitty, just check it out..crazy....The onlive app (lets you stream & play computer games from their servers to the TV) is not working right now. Onlive tech support said they are working on it but no ETA.Also had an issue with my Tivo premiere not getting the right channel codes from google TV for OTA channels (IR blaster sends whole numbers instead of 2.1, 2.2, 4.2 etc.), but now I have basic cable so that isn't a problem any moreTV picture itself is great, like most TV's today. With OTA the quality is amazing, but cable still looks great too. The are a ton of options to fool with the picture that I have yet to tackle except for true motion which I turned off (Like every TV that has this, makes any show look like a soap opera)So far this TV is doing exactly what I wanted to it do, allow me to cut most of my cable bill (just internet and basic cable now)saving me allot of $$ and my wife approves, and can use it without much fuss", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing!", "Author": "Richard De La Torre \"Richard\"", "ReviewID": "R123IRM9BLA0TM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I could not be more pleased with my purchase.  I bought this when it was selling for $860 and I feel like a complete thief.  This TV is spectacular, and only going to get better (the Google 4.2 update just started going out on these units).  First off, the TV itself is a work of art.  Absolutely elegant design. The picture is stunningly clear.  Colors are vibrant, black is very good.  I don't have cable and I was afraid this would limit what I could watch on this TV, such as the Primetime guide, but much to my surprise, it works just as well with my OTA digital antennae.  It still gives me the same beautiful cover-art for the over-the-air shows I watch just like if I had a cable provided connected to it.  It picked up about twice as many channels as the TV tuner I had connected to my old TV, so that's one less piece of hardware I have to use.  I've used smart TV's from the past and they tend to have sluggish menus.  Not this TV.  I'm surprised by how smooth everything runs.  Switching apps is as intuitive and nearly as quick as on a modern Android phone.  Menus in apps like Netflix and Amazon are incredibly responsive, I'm sure due to the dual-core processor sitting inside this TV.The remote control is fantastic. I've read some complaints about it here, but I think some folks didn't take the time to run the remote tutorial that shows you how to use it.  I love it.  The built-in keyboard and voice search work perfectly.  Setting up my Netflix, Amazon, and other accounts on it was a breeze.  Only wish it included Hulu Plus as well, but for now I'll just keep watching it on my Xbox 360.  On that note, video games look fantastic on it as well.  I didn't think GTA V could look much better, but playing it on this TV compared to my old LCD tv is a world of difference.  Everything is so much crisper and cleaner.The 3D is surprisingly good.  I purchased Avatar 3D and watched it on this TV and I felt like I was in the theater. the TV comes with all of the inputs and outputs you could want, the configuration and setup was not confusing at all.  It supports a number of apps, including Flipboard, IMDB, Netflix, Crackle, and others.  Being able to check my Facebook feeds while watching TV is a nice plus.  At the moment, I'm pondering purchasing another for my bedroom, that's how much I love this TV.  As I mentioned earlier, LG just announced that it's starting to trickle out updates to the Google OS on their GA line.  Very much looking forward to the update where I will have access to even more apps.The only negatives are all associated with the TV running and older (3.2) version of Android.  The Youtube app plays content fine, but doesn't sync my history and subscriptions, but I expect that to be fixed once the update comes down. There isn't much of a selection of apps in the app store, but again, I attribute that to the older Android version.  That update should fix the only, very minor, issues I have with this TV.I can't recommend this TV enough. If you are in the market for a great LED Smart TV at an amazing price, you will be hard-pressed to find better than this.", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesomeness in a thinly package", "Author": "TV McGuirk \"TVM\"", "ReviewID": "R1XZ8CX7UGW7UG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After being loyal Amazon customers for years, I figure that I owe it to other customers to write reviews. This is my first in depth review of a large purchase. So if you will indulge me:We received the TV 3 days ago and I have only good things to say about it.First, I am not going to review the Google TV feature. I only bought this TV because it was on sale and was not persuaded by the Google TV feature. If you have a Roku 3 and PS3 like I do, the Google TV feature is \"meh.\" For me, it was nice to mess around with for 5 minutes out of the box but afterwards I just went back to my Roku 3 because everything is already registered with my Roku and I would rather use that. But some people like the Google TV feature, so it would be unfair to them to say it is no good when I really could care less about it and was biased from the beginning. If you like little extras that Google TV puts with your cable/satellite then by all means go for it, personally, I wouldn't pay extra for them, but I didn't anyways.Secondly, I am not going to get all technical with numbers like 120Hz framerate and what not because if you care about those numbers, great, but this review might not persuade you. You might want to read some technical reviews instead, which is ok too. My review is for the person who might not know too much about this stuff but wants a nice TV because the damn kids broke the old one, which happened to us twice. That is why they get Dynex and we get LG.That being said, I know my way around TV quality. We have 2 LG TVs in the house and 2 budget Dynex TVs for the little ones. I have seen good LCD screens and bad LCD screens. This TV has great LCD screen. This TV is in our basement in a makeshift home theater with a future LG sound bar. The sound quality is actually pretty good for TV speakers, but you know, they are still TV speakers. I have not had to mess with the picture calibration yet because we haven't watched much on it other than The Avengers on Netflix and an old episode of Cheers on Amazon Prime that my dad wanted to watch, but I am planning on calibrating it later to get everything perfect (even without calibration this set is great, I just like a certain bright and vivid look of it for my personal preference and my dad likes a more faded and less bright look because his eyes are bad.)As for the black level, it is an LED TV, the blacks are not going to be as black as on a plasma, but the black levels are fine with this one. Unless you are really picky, then you can live with black levels being a bit grey. They are maybe 90% black, 10% grey if you had to put a number by them.The inputs for the TV are convenient. It has 4 HDMI, one of which is MHL (Mobile) which I am still kind of trying to wrap my brain around. The component and composite share the same audio because they are both on 2 3.5mm inputs (you need a component to 3.5mm adapter and composite to 3.5mm adapter both of which are included but if you lose them then you can find some on here or monoprice.com), it includes 2 USB ports which can power small things like my Turtle Beach XP500 receiver or they can play certain media from a flash drive. It also has the standard optical and stereo outputs (I am waiting on my LG sound bar and until then I am using computer speakers with the stereo output)The remote is really fat but they had to cram a lot of tech in there so that is understandable. I will probably be using my Harmony with it (The grey one that has the screen for $60) forgive me for forgetting the model of it. But if you want to use the fat little remote then it will work fine, it is just another personal preference thing, so I will not review it beyond that.In conclusion, as always use a surge protector on a grounded outlet with any electronic that you can't easily afford to replace. These new LED TVs use a lot less electricity than other TVs but still, use a quality surge protector that says \"SURGE PROTECTOR\" on the packaging. Otherwise you are getting a power strip.I named my review something catchy or what I thought would be catchy. Thinly refers to the thin profile and this is the thinnest TV I have ever owned. I can easily see in 7-10 years having TVs that are so thin they are flexible. Anyways, buy this TV if you want convenience, good picture and sound quality, and if you are into the whole Google TV thing.PS: I haven't tested out the 3D on this TV but if it is anything like my other LG TV, then I will be happy. It is nice because it is passive (Theater-like 3D with the cheapo glasses) which I like and it really adds depth to the screen and doesn't end up looking like a pop up book sort of 3D. If the 3D is sub-par for me then I will update and take a star off because this TV is going to be used for 3D gaming with my PS3 and for movies and 3D is very important to me.Update: I calibrated the TV using my poor man's method (Watching football and making the colors of the jerseys as close as possible)Eco: Off. LED TVs use less energy anyways.Backlight: 60Brightness: 60Contrast: 100Color: 60Sharpness: 20Warmth: C5Tint: 0Trumotion: OFF! 60Hz TV looks horrible on forced 120HzEverything else default on STANDARD mode.This is a compromise between my dad and me but it works for both of us and if 2 men with thick glasses can enjoy the TV, then you guys can too.", "Date": "August 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "A week in, I'm just not sold.", "Author": "Kyle Lewton", "ReviewID": "RT3USVRDYSFT5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was looking forward to this TV (mainly the higher end 7900), I was in the market for a new tv in the bedroom and also the living room. I figured the 47' 6400 would be a fine addition to the bedroom, saw it at best buy and figured why not, I'll pick it up today. For the most part, I really do like it. PQ is solid, the android feel to it is cool and in my opinion, it's a pretty nice looking tv. For $1,100, it was a good pickup. Well, I'm second guessing myself.First off, you will notice immediately that the sound quality is mediocre at best. Sounds echoey. I can get over this as I planned on getting a sound bar for it on my next day off. This is no issue, it can and will be fixed.Here's my real problem at the moment, and I apologize if it is the blu ray player at fault but it certainly appeared to be the tv. Me and my girlfriend decided we would relax and watch finding nemo in 3d tonight on the new tv in our bedroom. Popped it in, put on the 3d glasses and started watching what appeared early on as a classic movie on one hell of a nice tv. I owned the es8000 for a week or two and man, this LG tv I got for half the price as the Samsung looked much better in 3d than the es8000!! Well that changed quickly.On certain scenes, mainly when the scenes were very \"fast\" and moving quickly, huge blocky pixels began forming and it was very noticeable. It ruined my experience after a while and it was just so frustrating. I have tried to do research on this, no one seems to have this problem, and when I see something close to it it seems as if the 120hz is to blame and 240hz is much better. I never once had that problem with the 240hz es8000, even when watching finding nemo on it.The bottom line... I'm disappointed. When spending over 1,000, you expect stuff to work right. Everything else has been good, I like the remote, the menus work well enough for me, picture quality is good, design is nice, very cool features. I have one more day to think about it until my next day off of work, but I am 90% sure that I will be carting this TV back into the best buy store. I have quite a few 3d movies and poor 3d quality is unacceptable to me. It is not nearly the most important factor to me, but I would like to pop a 3d movie in without experiencing these problems. Really wish I could leave this TV mounted on the stand in my room. I will be taking a look at the LM9600 for the living room and LM8600 for the bedroom, good reviews with no such 3d problem reported on either one. If the 2012 models appear better and can save me some money, I'm fine with it.

This is my first tv on the nicer end of the scale.  My initial impression of this tv is that it is good, but not perfect.  Most of my complaints are with the software, so I am optimistic that it can be improved with future updates.  I feel like Google TV has potential to be totally awesome, but it's just not quite there yet.  I'm giving it 4 stars because I like it a lot, but it's not perfect.Installation/set-up:-Installation/set-up was pretty easy.  The only physical stuff you have to do is screw the 2 pieces of the stand together and then screw the stand to the tv.  As long as you can work a screwdriver, you'll be fine.  The TV is pretty heavy (I'm a 5'2\" woman), but I was still able to manage it on my own.-Once it's physically put together, just turn it on and it quickly guides you through all the necessary set up (connecting to WiFi, connecting to your cable box, etc).  I found the set-up wizard to be very easy to use.  Other people have had problems connecting to WiFi, but I had no issues.-The manual is not great.  It explains how to set the thing up, but there's nothing in there about how to work the Google TV features, etc.-You have to be sure to position the \"IR blasters\" correctly.  When I initially started writing this review I had a section saying that I could not get the magic remote to work with my cable box.  This turned out to be because I had not positioned the IR blasters correctly.  It seems to be working now.  If it's not working for you, I suggest fiddling around with the positioning a little bit.  Once the IR blasters are positioned correctly your cable box can be blocked/covered and the remote will still work.  I'm a fan of this because I used to have to have the cable box sitting out next to the tv.  Now it's nicely hidden away in the cabinet below.Aesthetics/structure:-It's very thin, which I love.-The stand swivels, which is nice.-[Update 8/24/13]: The glossy screen looks nice, but it can be pretty reflective.  I have big bay windows a few feet to the right of my tv, and there is a noticeable reflection on the right of my screen.  I'm not sure how much this is going to bother me.Picture and sound:-The sound is good.  Again, I'm not a techie or an audiophile, and I'm sure that if I bought expensive speakers it would be much better, but I don't think that they're necessary.  The sound is much, much better than my old Vizio.-The picture is good.  I'm still playing around with a little bit, but it looks pretty good.  I have been trying to find some guide on the internet about calibration settings, but it looks pretty good on the \"Cinema\" setting or after playing around with the Calibration Wizard.  The one major issue was the \"Soap Opera Effect\" caused by the Trumotion setting.  This is easy to turn off, but I'm glad that I had read about it ahead of time, otherwise it would have been intolerable.  I also recommend reading the Amazon Q&A; above about how to turn off the Trumotion effect for Netflix.  I would not not have figured this out otherwise.-I will leave the details about this stuff to the other reviewers who know what they're talking about.  From my layman's perspective, it looks and sounds good.Google TV/Apps:-The Google TV stuff is pretty hard to navigate, at least at first.  It is already getting easier as I get more used to the tv, but it is really not very intuitive.  I find myself wandering through menus a lot trying to figure stuff out, at least at first.  At first I really disliked it, but I'm slowly liking it more as I figure it out.  Still, it could be much better.  For example, the settings function is buried as an \"app,\" which really makes no sense.  It does seem like it has a lot of potential though, so hopefully it becomes easier.  It seems like a lot of this stuff would be pretty easy for them to re-design, so I am cautiously optimistic.  I will update if I find myself liking it significantly more.-I have started playing with the \"Primetime\" app a little bit and so far I am a big fan.  In the \"Live TV\" sections it suggests stuff that is on right now.  It asks you to rate a bunch of movies and tv shows (1-5 scale) so that it gets a sense of what you like.  Then it starts suggesting stuff.  Those kind of things are never going to be totally accurate, but I'm pretty impressed by what it is suggesting.  It breaks it down into categories (Movies, Comedy, Drama, Family, Reality, etc).  When it suggests a show, it also gives you the option to rate it or say \"not interested,\" which presumably will make future suggestions better and better.  The main Primetime screen also has a spot for you to select favorite channels, and it then automatically shows you what is on each of those channels.  If you're like me and you find yourself really only watching 5 or so channels 90% of the time, this is nice.  It also has a place to select \"favorite tv shows.\"  I have not used this yet, but I assume that you can click on a show and it will tell you if/when it is on.  There is also a separate screen to search for an individual show.  You can then select it and it will tell you when it is on live tv, and if it is on Netflix, Amazon, etc.  This is is a nice convenience because you won't have to check 3 different places to find out if a movie is available somewhere.-A big negative is that the HBOGo \"app\" is not an app.  When you press the HBOGo button it just takes you to the HBOGo website.  This is extremely hard to navigate, and when I finally got to the episode of the show I wanted, it wouldn't even load.  I will try this again eventually, but I am not optimistic.  I ended up using my Roku to access HBOGo.  I already happened to have the Roku from my old tv, but if you don't already have some other kind of streaming device, this is something to consider.  I use HBOGo a lot, so this is unfortunate.-As other people have said, Hulu is not an option.  I will use my Roku to watch it, but for the amount of money that this tv costs, it's a shame that I have to.-So far I've tried Netflix and Amazon Instant, both of which worked well (after the Trumotion was turned off).  Other people have said they had problems with buffering, but I have not encountered an issue yet (although I have watched very little so far).-Google Chrome works pretty well.  It looks pretty much like it does on your computer, and you can navigate with the \"gesture\" function on the remote.  I guess it's cool that you can do this, but I have a hard time imagining why I would need to browse the internet with a tv remote.  But, it's there if you want it.Magic remote:-The QWERTY feature is awesome.  I love not having to scroll through a keyboard the way you have to on a Roku and most other devices.-The \"gesture\" feature takes a little getting used it, but it's a nice option, and I expect that I will start to like it more as I use it more.-As long as you can get it to work with your cable box, it works well.  [Updated 8/24/13]: It takes a little getting used to because it may not be set up quite the same way as your old remote.  It took me a while to figure out that the QWERTY side had dedicated buttons for Live TV, PIP, Info, and DVR.  These were all features that I was wishing for.  You can also assign different functions to these four keys if you have some other feature you want.  Now that I've figured this out, it does pretty much everything on my cable box.-The voice feature is pretty cool.  I thought you could only use it to search, but you can actually use it for commands too.  You can say \"Open Netflix\" and Netflix pops right up.  Or you can say \"NBC\" and it will take you to the right channel.  You can also say \"Breaking Bad\" and it will take you to the Breaking Bad show page in Primetime, which then shows you when it's on tv and where you can find it on Netflix.  I'm very impressed by how accurate it is.  So far I've only had one mix up, and it was mostly my fault for holding the button down too long.  I expect to play around with this feature more in the future, but so far I'm very impressed and I'm already using it way more than I thought I would.-I think that it probably has some tricks that take some figuring out.  When you first start using the tv it gives you a bunch of pointers at once, but unless you're sitting there with a notepad you probably won't remember it all.  I just discovered that if you hold down the Home key, it brings up a list of your most recent apps, which makes things way easier to navigate.  I only realized this by accident though, it was not in the manual.-It's a little heavy for a remote, but not a big deal.-I was not able to program my Roku to work with the remote.  Roku is not listed among the available manufacturers for devices.3D:-I turned one of the 3D documentaries on very briefly, just to see what it was like (I have never used a 3D tv before).  I expected to be impressed, but I actually did not like it very much.  The effects didn't look great, and it gave me a headache pretty quickly.  I am holding my judgment on this one though until I get a chance to watch a good 3D blu-ray.  Other people seem to like it a lot, so it is entirely possible that this particular documentary was just poorly done.  I doubt that this is a feature that I will end up using frequently, but it's nice to have the option.I will update this review if any of this changes significantly.Updates:8/24/13: Updated a few areas where I was mistaken on my initial review.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Oh the thinks you can think", "Author": "Thomas", "ReviewID": "R3TMVLUFM08SRP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let's start at the beginning. When it comes to setup the TV is pretty straight forward. There are a total of 8 screws that need to be used for the stand. After the TV is powered on for the first time there is a setup wizard that will walk you through connecting to the Internet, syncing your cable or satellite providor with Google TV and Primetime, surround sound, IR Blaster, and connecting any devices such as 3D blu ray etc. This will also show you how to use the remote which has a pointer option similar to the controller on the WII and a microphone to speak your commands to the TV.The remote has a full qwerty keyboard and feels good in your hands. The weight is just right, it's compact, and you aren't overwhelmed with to many buttons. There are simple directional arrows, a scroller which is also the select button, 3D mode, voice control, back, guide, home, mute and power. The qwerty keyboard is used with your thumbs. Size of keyboard is about right. It's kind of like an old school Side Kick. Symbols are difficult to see in the dark and you have to hold down the function button to type them. You will be using the remote ALOT because of the keyboard and voice control so I think it's important. Sometimes using the pointer gets frustrating because it is very sensitive when trying to surf the web and click on small icons and links. Tab button and arrows sometimes work better. I also noticed that when I was trying to hold the pointer steady it sometimes moved slowly across the screen by itself at first but has not done this recently.The microphone on the remote is really accurate. You can say things like \"sports\", \"Seinfeld\", \"action movies\", \"movies about _______\". When you want to search Google just say \"find __________\" and Google pops up. If the show is on that the name of which you speak into the remote it will go to that channel, if not it will give info and show future listings. It's fun to test the remote like Siri and see if it works. You can also say the names of apps like Netflix.Primetime is great. You just press the guide button and titles from you cable or satellite provider are all arranged by category at your fingertips literally. The Primetime guide shows what look like the DVD covers for all movies and tv shows instead of just titles, progress bars for each title, whether the program or movie is in hd, and are arranged by movies on TV, comedy, drama, sports, news an talk, family, reality and game shows, special interest, and music. You can also create a category with your favorite channels instead of searching through your cable or satellite guides. You can rate shows and movies and google tv will make suggestions for you. It has changed my viewing experience. There is also a category that shows recently watched, a dvr menu and an option for Primetime full screen. I will try and post a picture of Primetime. If you press guide twice it brings up you cable or satellite provider \"old fashioned\" guide. If you press menu you can get to your dvr recordings. Everything is super user friendly.The home button shows you live tv, premium apps, 3d world which has some 3d programs, smart share, and my interests like news and whether all at once. The bottom of the home screen has frequently used widgets. I will try and post a pic of the home screen as well.The Google Play store has tons of apps that are available. I sign into google with my Ipad and search for apps there. Google can filter apps by the device the apps will be installed on. I press devices and my lg tv is there. (This is configured during setup. You need a google account or need to creat one.) After selecting my device it shows only apps for the TV. Many apps are not yet available for google tv, however there are still a bunch of apps that are. A couple cools ones are Mitty (be careful with this one) and airtight (stream from you ipad movies, music, pictures to your tv). Most of the things that you can think of that an app could do are there. Just check out the play store. Netflix is very user friendly on this tv. When I purchased my lg through amazon I got 6 months free. No Hulu though that I know of.I purchased a USB drive that was 3.0 and tried to play a movie off of it. I plugged the drive into one of my USB ports on the TV and opened it with the app smart share. It skipped, was grainy, choppy, and very poor playback quality. I tried different players and they were even worse. I was just trying to play an AVI file. I called Amazon and the lady said it was because I was using a 3.0 and needed a 2.0. This didn't make very much sense to me but I exchanged the 3.0 for a 2.0 anyways and will let you know it this makes a difference. But thus far the USB drive is a fail.The picture quality is great even from my \"HD\" cable box. I have a ultra thin hdmi cable that I got from mono price hooked up but I purchased a Monster hdmi cable from Amazon which is arriving today. 3d is crazy on this tv. Very crisp. The 3d glasses are very simple and don't need batteries. It comes with four pairs. The glasses are very sensitive though so only use a microfiber cloth to clean. The 3d blu ray movies I have played are of amazing quality on this tv. Very smooth, no choppiness. The player I have takes a while to load but I ordered a new 3d blu ray player from lg which is also coming today so I will update after I get the player and monster hdmi cable.The sound is above average compared to other led/LCD TV speakers I have heard. It's really the best I've heard personally. Better than my Samsung 55\". However I ordered an lg sound bar which is coming in a few days through amazon. TV speakers are usually disappointing after having surround. I guess they are tolerable but could be much better. There is no bass at all. I will update when I get the sound bar.I have no use for the ir blaster or don't know that I do. I haven't read into it very much. I Guess that's all for now let me know if you have any questions and I'll try and find an answer or share my experience. I will be updating soon as there is too much that this tv can do to write it all in one sitting.", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Motion blur lowers value dramatically", "Author": "Eric M.

The motion blur is noticable during football games (especially on the sideline views) and other fast moving scenes (action scenes especially). I've owned the 55\" GA6400 for seven months and have been disappointed with it. I recently bought my girlfriend a 47\" Seiki and even though the picture is not quite as vivid as the LG, it is more than adequate and doesn't have the same motion blur (even though the Seiki is a 60Hz tv).The features associated with this tv are extensive and unique, but the reality is I don't find myself using them very much (except Netflix and the browser) and even then I have issues with loading errors. Bottom line, if you don't have to have a smart tv, then you can buy a non-smart tv and grab a smart blu ray player and save yourself a significant amount of money with similar picture quality.

Foster \"operabruin\"", "ReviewID": "R26AN3Y816KJUK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have lived with this television set now for some time.However, perhaps, being that I am not a Techie or such, my thoughts may not go deep enough for some who come here looking for advice, etc.That said, I must tell you that I am totally impressed (even after all these months of ownership and watching -- mostly dvd and blu-ray movies) every time I see something on it. This is the first large-screen television that I have ever owned. It is also the first or only high-def one that I have owned....also, too the first 3-d set. All three counts here are winners to me, although I could live without the 3-d if it were not included here on this set. I could be quite happy with simple high definition alone.I find the control a little cumbersome, but at 67 and arthritis in my hands, that is expected, I figure, and luckily I need to not use it frequently.Sound....well, a couple years back I invested in a Denon 7.1 surround set-up, and so I am not able to \"fairly\" rate this sets sound on its own as there is no comparison fairly done between the two for me to be done. But! With my system, coupled with the picture....this is some sweet set!I have not as yet taken avail of the \"internet\" type capabilities available, but will do so, slowly probably, in the future. At the present I am completely and happily entertained with the ability to watch my opera dvds and my movies and miscellaneous music videos in my extensive collection.Oh, also, I am finding that I see NO increase in my electric bill even with the extensive hours I spend watching! I find this amazing! And, additionally, living on a fixed income, a stroke of \"good luck\" as well!

It happens, so I'm not upset about that at all as that is what warranties are for.  My update comments here are specific to LG service and support.  You never really know, until you need it, how good or bad manufacturer service and support will be.  I am happy to say that LG impressed me with their warranty support on this TV.I initiated a service request online, and received a prompt appointment window (Monday afternoon request, service guy was here Wednesday around noon).  They do telephone confirmation the prior day with you by phone call, and you can track your open repair ticket on line.  In my case, based on the failure description.. the fault was likely the control card or the power inverter.  Well, the service rep swapped both and no fix. That leaves the flat panel.. so he had to come back with a flat panel (which was on Friday).  I don't fault them on this as that flat panel is extremely expensive so I do not expect them to carry a spare with them for every possible screen size.  They are very good about their day/time commitments and he was indeed back with a brand new panel on Friday morning and that fixed the issue for me.I watched the service rep as he did the diagnostics and repair and I give him high marks for attention to detail, knowledge, and professionalism.The other thing to note is how simple the design of this TV is in terms of electronics and mechanics.  It's extremely easy to dismantle and there are literally only three field replaceable parts (controller card, power inverter, and flat panel) + the awesome remote.  It's very well designed for field repair, and if you have any service experience at all you could self-repair (unless it was the flat panel as it costs more then the price I paid for the TV) If the flat panel goes out after warranty.. throw the TV away.. their FRU cost exceeds the cost of the TV and the flat panels are not repairable (they toss them if they fail).In closing.. I was very pleased with this TV when I purchased it and I am even more pleased with how well LG responded to a defective unit repair. :)---Original Review ---This TV from LG is awesome.  (I purchased the 42 inch unit)Easy to setup, excellent build quality, no issues or defects at all.The display is outstanding.  I'm not a big 3D fan, but I have to say.. the passive 3D in this TV is excellent as well.I know some people have been critical of the unit for black background..... but I simply don't see the problem.  Colors are vibrant and very appealing right out of the box as well.. and with a few adjustments for my particular setup they were perfect.Wireless connection to my network was a snap.. and flawless.The TV firmware is extremely smart and intuitive in most cases.  Some of the menus to find nuance things such as sound select and sound set up are a little more buried then I would prefer.. but once you learn the path.. it's a nit to me.The TV immediately checked for updates and committed a firmware update on first powerup (with my consent of course).  Flawless. and took only a few minutes.  The TV also does a nice job of stepping you through initial setup and configuration of the TV... which was pleasant and appreciated.GoogleTV does not impress.. but I did not buy the TV expecting good things from googleTV at this stage.  So I don't care.. it will get better with time I am sure.  I bought the google version of this TV to get the remote (see below)The TV autoconfigured to my ATT Uverse remote control interface very well, and with only a few cycles of choosing from me (because there are a bunch of different boxes for ATT.  This is on ATT not the TV as far as I am concerned.  The IR blaster is flawless.Now to the remote.  AWESEOME!  I LOVE THIS REMOTE.  It has a full mini qwerty keyboard on the reverse side and simple and easy to use function control on the front side. Finally.. a remote that makes searching for content on my ATT Uverse a breeze... no more faux-alphabet via number keys!  There is a Wii style floating pointer feature, as well as a voice input mode as well.  The floating pointer is great.. though not that relevant unless you use the googleTV and apps. I have not tried the voice command interface yet.As I said.. googleTV... not that important to me.. but I do love that we have a full android appliance and access to apps!  The TV did come with Amazon OnDemand app loaded and it worked flawlessly right out of the box.  Comes with HBOgo preinstalled as well.. and you can easily load new apps if you want and it's not already there.  If you are an android app fan.. then this TV will not disappoint.The front face of the TV does have an anti-glare coating of some sort and I know some people have complained that it is too glossy.. but I disagree.  It strikes a good balance in providing crisp transparency with modest anti-glare performance.  Personally.. I like it.I have a PC connected to one of the HDMI ports and can sit back in my cozy family room and operate the computer from a wireless keyboard and mouse with ease.  Why anyone would browse he web with googleTV.. I have no idea.  :)  Gaming performance is great with my PC and this TV connected as the display.  No noticeable lag or latency at all.  The TV will remember modes sets for each HDMI port.. so I have the PC set for game mode and it reverts automatically when I switch to TV or BluRay.  So for gaming on a PC.. this TV works fine.  I don't know if it would meet the demands of \"twitch\" players on consoles.. but for MMOs on PC.. it's fine.The only nit about the TV that I did not like is that the analog audio out port disables sound effect options when it is plugged in and it's volume is controlled from the main volume control of the TV.  I keep wireless headsets setup to my TVs for when you want to watch and hear TV without disturbing the rest of the home.. and this implementation of the analog sound port is a disappointment here.  But it was easy to solve.  I just purchased a small digital to analog audio converter and hooked it to the digital optical output.  The digital optical output does not override sound effects on the main TV audio and it also is not modulated by TV volume control.. so it completely solves my problem (for about $35).  You can have both the TV and the optical audio out enabled.. which means I can control the TV audio without regard to audio on the wireless headsets (which have their own controls anyway).Overall.. awesome TV.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "AWESOME TV", "Author": "Jean M.

As we were moving in right around the Google I/O conference I waited until after all the new products were announced before placing the order for this TV.  At the time I ordered the 55 in. was the largest available as I wasn't willing to wait another two months to get the 60 in. version.Our previous setup was a LG 42 in. TV with a Logitech Revue Companion Box with Google TV and Keyboard Controller.  I was very happy to have another LG TV and also happy to not have to pull additional wires through the wall for the Google TV.  Due to some issues with the wall framing over the fireplace it was harder than expected to get the new TV mounted to the Peerless PT660 Universal Tilt Wall Mount for 32 Inch to 60 Inch Displays Black over our fireplace.  Now that the TV has been mounted we've been enjoying using it for the last 6 weeks.The industrial design makes the TV look great even when its off.  Mounted over the fireplace it is nice to have silver, not black, bezel as it makes the room feel warmer.  We've been using this TV with Xfinity so I'm not sure how the picture is compared to an uncompressed HDTV signal from an OTA broadcast source.  So far I have no complaints with live TV viewing.As we have a three year old who is slightly obsessed with Dora the Explorer and Jake and the Never Land Pirates we do a lot of streaming from Netflix and from Amazon Prime Video.  The YouTube app is fantastic in that you can pair your phone or tablet (Android or iOS) to the TV and find a video while another video is playing on the big TV.  When you have the next video you can send the video from your tablet to the big TV for everyone to watch.  I am also a fan of the Photos for Google TV app.  With the app all your photos from Picasa, Google+, and Flickr (I think... I'm not a Flickr user) can be easily shared up on the big screen.  Its great for parties or sports teams.  I've been using the PrimeTime app more and more.  Its miles ahead of the Comcast grid, and I like that it learns what I like and I can select favorite channels, but I still think my TiVo TCD746500 Premiere DVR - Black has the best and fastest channel selector I've ever used.The new remote is the best Google TV remote I have used yet!  The magic mouse is much easier to use than any small touch pad!  The QWERTY keyboard is not backlit, but I have not had any problems using it in the normal ambient lighting I find comfortable for TV viewing.The TV does come with several pairs of 3D glasses but we have not used them yet.  Other than watching Avatar again I'm not sure we'll use the 3D capability.For those that are concerned that this TV is running an older version of Android, LG has announced that this TV will be upgraded to Android \"Jelly Bean\" this fall allowing for even more apps to be used with the TV.This TV has been easier to use for both my wife and nanny than our previous setup.  While I never had a problem with the old TV and Revue, I never get called to make \"YOUR TV\" work anymore!I ordered this TV with scheduled home delivery.  The local provider for Amazon was CEVA.  The were on time, courteous and quickly had the TV out of the box and on its stand (before I was ready to wall mount) and ready to go within 15 minutes.A few minor points are holding back the last star.  I have seen a few crashes out of the Netflix app.  This does not completely wipe out the system, but it does drop you back into live TV.  At the time I mounted the TV I should have pulled a ethernet cable with the HDMI as my Comcast HD Box does not support ethernet.  The TV works fine over WiFi using our Cisco-Linksys  WRT120N Wireless-N Home Router most of the time, but occasionally when watching a HD movie from Amazon streaming some slow loading and quality degradation is visible.There is an even higher end version of this TV LG Electronics 55GA7900 55-Inch Cinema Screen Cinema 3D 1080p 240Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Google TV and Four Pairs of 3D Glasses available.

Have had the TV for almost 30 days now, and have been contemplating returning it since the first day. The only things keeping me from doing that are: side loading some of the apps missing (compatible) on the play store and found a way to see the files from my computer on the TV by using VLC pro. The other app is airdroid. Besides that, have had to pull the power cord out 3 times to reset the TV(twice it froze and Wi-Fi not working). The casing by LG is weak(can see the backlight thru the sides of the TV where the glass and the casing meets), it came with a dead pixel, the IR blaster cable is too short to reach my dish box(6 foot cable), so if your TV is mounted and distance between TV ir port and front of box is longer than 6ft then you are in trouble, and other less annoying things related to software. Overall, the extra couple of hundred dollars for the Google TV integration so far not with it. I work for a  telecommunication company and have been doing it for 9 yrs. I have always recommended my customers Samsung TVs for their superior quality, only decided to go with LG for the Google TV integration and not having to buy a separate device, thinking that being built into the TV would have been a better experience, but so far I'm disappointingly wrong.

The TV did turn off on it's own one time but that was probably my mistake. Many of the programs and movies we have watched are well rendered in 3-D. The Grinch Who Stole Christmas is like a full motion Viewmaster of ole, for those who remember them and it. The menu and home differential take a bit of getting use to as Home is where your settings truly lie for changing preference in sound picture and many various settings. Now it took 10 seconds to get wi-fi running including typing in the password so I highly doubt there are issues with WEP protection, not saying others didn't have issues, but I am not that savvy technology wise and no problems have occurred yet.

Sorry to burst your bubble but depth is added by interlacing and phase shifting the images in key areas to give the illusion of 3 dimensions in a 2-D image, an optical illusion I am finding quite pleasing. I hated Days and As the World Turns when I was a kid as they interfered with cartoons and here I am defending them in a cruel twist of fate, as watching soaps is more realistic and lifelike appearance wise than regular television programs. Some of the features haven't been utilized yet but I'll bet they are just as functional when I decide to. LG deserves props for this marvel of technology and I hope it doesn't poop out within the next 4 years as I got that warranty and hope they honor it fully or maybe not need it at all. You rock Amazon for the price on Prime and LG you rock for the ingenuity encompassing it.

Pictures look gorgeous on this TV, and the features for internet TV viewing make a media player box not really useful. The reason I'm writing this review though is that amazon.com advertises the GA6400 family of TVs as WIDI capable, and this was one of the reasons I selected this TV. lge.com customer service stated though that Google TVs (including all GA6400, all sizes) do not support WIDI. One example of GA6400 amazon description that advertises the GA6400 as WIDI capable is LG Electronics 50GA6400 50 Inch LED LCD I would give four or five stars to the TV itself, but lower the number of stars for the way this TV is described incorrectly on amazon.com.", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Overall A Great TV Upgrade", "Author": "strausd", "ReviewID": "R3NZ4RVMWBCVSZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently got the 55\" LG GA6400. Thanks to in store price matching at Fry's, I was able to get it for the exact same price as it is on Amazon (currently $1029).For non tech-savvy users, the biggest downside will be the sound quality. As others have mentioned this TV does not produce great sound. Most audio coming out sounds \"echoey\". A soundbar is definitely suggested. But let's remember, TV manufacturers are becoming obsessed with making thinner and thinner TVs. Because of this, there is less room for larger speakers. The thinner the TV, the smaller the speakers, it is pretty simple really. This Google TV isn't even the thinnest out there, but it sure sounds like it. The speakers are located on the bottom of the TV pointing straight down. You can mess with some audio settings on the TV to help, and enabling virtual surround sound and changing the audio to vivid in the quick settings helps. But again, a soundbar is suggested. My older TV, which was nearing a decade, sounded better. But it could accommodate larger speakers, so that makes sense.The TV itself offers great picture. Contrast and brightness look great even in well lit rooms. At high backlight levels, it can produce a decent amount of heat, but I find I never need to bring the backlighting all the way up. Viewing angles look good so far when viewing 2D images, but not so much with 3D. This is a common problem with 3D TVs though, so it was expected.The 2D-3D conversion isn't that great. Don't plan on watching 2D movies in 3D using this. The best way to watch 3D movies on this TV is either through a capable blu-ray player or by having a 3D movie file. However, if you use Plex you CANNOT watch 3D movies through it. For whatever reason, LG was stupid enough to not allow Plex to take advantage of various 3D formats like side by side images or one on top of another. Your only bet to watch 3D movie files is using Smartshare. And getting movies on Smartshare isn't as easy as Plex.In regards to Plex, it is probably the thing I use most on the TV. However, LG, again being stupid, gave users an old version of Plex that cannot be updated. You have to go to the Play store to download the updated version with costs money at the time of writing this. Also, the paid version currently has a bug making all non 16:9 format videos distorting to fill the screen. Hopefully this will be fixed soon.Overall UI is fairly simple. One thing I find odd is that if you want to use the scroll wheel, you can only use it when the gesture cursor is activated. Meaning if you are in Plex or Smartshare and want to scroll down a list, you have to use the buttons. If you want to use the wheel, you must enable the gesture cursor.The UI isn't completely fluid. I have a feeling this is partially because LG is stuck years behind. Some examples I can think of are switching between apps, going to the home screen, doing something simple and hitting the back button, switching between home and live TV, etc. But in all fairness, nobody has really made a completely fluid TV UI. I suspect that is why most people are eagerly waiting for an Apple-made TV set as even back with their 2007 iPhone, it ran smoother than many Android phones today. This TV runs Android 3.2 despite it beings years old. Also, LG has a video on YouTube showing Android 4.2 on this TV, which I believe they uploaded back in March. However, even now with it being almost September, LG will not tell me when 4.2 will be available on their TV.In relation to LG customer support, the people who work for them typically know nothing. I asked them about the IR blaster before buying this TV, and I was told it only supports one provider: Dish Network. However, it easily connected to my FiOS box with just a few clicks. I suspect it will work for most major cable providers and their respective boxes and DVRs.Some common TV buttons are not easily accessible using the so called \"Magic Remote.\" For example, there is no easy way to start recording a TV show. You have to hit menu, press the right arrow a few times, and then the middle button. On my cable remote, there is just one button. And for going straight to live TV if you have rewinded a little bit, even more clicks are required. However, I found that the most common buttons are easily accessible.Most functions work fine. And it is great to have a remote control app for your phone. However, some functions do not work on iPhones, such as seeing a list of channels and what is playing. Some functions do not work on my Nexus 4, such as remotely turning the TV off despite this same exact function working on an iPhone. Also, with the Smartshare app on the TV, LG says to download the Smartshare app on LG made Android phones. However, the Nexus 4 is made by LG but you cannot get the app on it.Overall I am happy with the TV, despite finding so many issues with it and LG. But I came into it knowing no TV is perfect, and considering the other options available today for the same price, this really is one of the best thanks to it running Google TV.

It was thought out buy so I didn't just jump on it when I saw it (although I wanted to).  Here are my quick summaries on reviewing this TV:1) Pictures - Excellent.  It is clear, bright, and colorful.  At 1080p it is truly wonderful to watch movies on this TV.  I thought the 120Hz was going to be an issue... but it was not (in my and my family's opinion).  Simply put, comparing this TV along side Vizio, Samsung, Sony (comparison made at Sam's Club display)... to name a few... and this easily came out on top.2) Features - This thing has tons of options and features!  I love the fact that you can easily navigate through it... but the real bonus is when it can easily give you a running list of the movies, shows, etc that are on right now... will be on... or if you want to buy or rent it.  I definitely has the ability to jump to the web when you setup  and connect the internet to it.  Being a long time Google user... it was a no brainer!  I can listen to my music, watch my shows, movies, etc from my Google account.  It has a pointer that is another cool feature of the remote as well as an excellent voice recognition utility... tell it to find movies, songs, etc.  I esp like the IR Blaster that you can hook up to control two devices (I used it on my Comcast cable box and my sound bar)... worked great with an easy setup!!  There are so many other features (just search You Tube for some really nice video reviews that go into details about the features).3) Cons - what I did not like about it.  Well, I did manage to find one thing... at this time Hulu Plus is not supported.  Man this sucks!  However... I watch it on my Nexus so no biggie for me (thus my 5 star rating)... however, if you don't have that option... this might lower the rating down to maybe 4.5 stars.  Not sure if they will fix this or not... but they did a major OS release that updated the TV just recently so who knows.So... would I recommend this TV... and the answer is \"yes, I would!\"  If you are a Google user... again... this TV is an excellent and awesome buy!", "Date": "August 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Google TV at this price range", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2STD7B108VZVX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Was looking for smart 3d tv, Never owned LG TV before.

Also, I am not a very tech-savvy individual. I purchased my first cell phone just a little over four years ago. I mention this is because when I recently had the opportunity to test the LG ELECTRONICS 47GA6400 42-INCH CINEMA 3D 1080p 120 Hz LED-LCD HDTV WITH GOOGLE TV AND FOUR PAIRS OF 3D GLASSES for free, I couldn't pass up the offer. However, the things I liked & didn't like and the things I noticed about the television probably aren't things that tech-savvy individuals will notice.My first impression after seeing this beast was, \"Oh my gosh! This thing is huge!\" Even when you measure ahead of time, you really have no idea how big 42\" is until you see it. This tv is by far the largest television anyone in my family has ever been in possession. No one in my family has ever owned a television larger than 32\", so it was kind of a shock to see how large this television actually is.With that said, here are some positive aspects I liked about the television:*The picture quality is great. As I mentioned earlier, I'm not a fan of 3D, but for some reason watching 3D pictures on this tv hasn't given me the headaches that I usually get when I watch a 3D movie in the movie theatres.*The LG ELECTRONICS 47GA6400 42-INCH CINEMA 3D 1080p 120 Hz LED-LCD HDTV WITH GOOGLE TV AND FOUR PAIRS OF 3D GLASSES allows a person to watch a regular movie and automatically transfer it to 3D. I won't say it does this with every movie, because there's usually an exception to the rule, but we've watched THE INCREDIBLES, KING KONG, and THE MASTER over the past few days and the tv did that for those movies.*The remote is really nice. It works kind of like a Wii controller. Even for someone who's not the most tech-savvy, I found the remote pretty easy to use and navigate with.*The Google Voice feature is impressive. So much so, that it's frightening. It'll give Apple's Siri a run for the money in voice recognition software.*The YouTube app makes it much easier to find and play YouTube videos. It seems to be set up different than the YouTube apps I've seen that are with other Internet televisions.Here are some negative aspects I didn't like about the television:*For a tv that is sold for around $1,000, the sound isn't very good. Don't get me wrong, the sound on this television sounds better than older tvs I have owned. However, for the cost of this particular television, you don't get the sound quality you should. You should be getting sound that sounds like surround sound theatre quality. Instead, you get sound slightly that is slightly better than the sound we got from our old large box screen television.*The set up of the television was troublesome. I had a difficult time connecting the television to our cable box.*The design of this television is nice, but personally, I don't like the legs/stand of the tv. They don't seem sturdy enough. Also, they remind me of skinny little arms and I don't like the idea of a television having arms that are trying to wrap themselves around my life.*The headphone jack is in the back, so it's not easily accessible. This is frustrating when playing multiplayer online video games.In short, the LG ELECTRONICS 47GA6400 42-INCH CINEMA 3D 1080p 120 Hz LED-LCD HDTV WITH GOOGLE TV AND FOUR PAIRS OF 3D GLASSES works wonderfully as a 42\" 3D tv. Also, the whole Google TV aspect (with Google Voice) has a strong appeal, especially if you're looking to cut the cable cord. However, there are some kinks in all the bells and whistles that the television has. It seems as if LG attempted to throw together as much as they could in this television and started mass producing them without thoroughly testing them. Some of the issues can be addressed if there are downloadable upgrades in the future, but other issues (such as the sound quality) can't be fixed.

Well I played around with LG Google TV for awhile, and I thought it was a good TV and recommended it to my brother. After he bought it, I went over and played with the settings to get the TV the right picture and the sound to be balanced out right since he didn't want a sound bar (yet).Well a few weeks later he told me that the remote wasn't working the right way. So I came over, played around with it and it worked and was also broken at the same time. To explain, the remote is a two in one, part remote on one side and keyboard on the other. So some buttons were sacrificed and merged into others. How my brother noticed is that the 3D/Mute button wasn't working, it would only mute the TV and would no longer put anything in 3D. So I had to contact LG twice, the first time the guy I spoke to was rude and would not listen to me at all. I told him it was the remote that was the problem, but he continued to make me do random tests on the TV and ask me stupid questions that had nothing to do with what I told him. When I told him it was the remote, not anything to do with the cable signal, not anything to do with the movie I wanted to watch in 3D, not anything to do with how old/new the HDMI is, or what update the TV has... it all remote. He then snapped at me, and hung up the phone.Called back, explained myself again and what happen before with whoever I was talking to and 2 weeks later I got a new remote and all was well in the world... till now.The TV will not stay connected to the router, and at first it was every once in awhile that it will drop, says it lost it's connection to router. We at first thought that it was the router, till we realized that everything else worked that was connected to it. The laptop, iPad, iPods and the other smart TV in the living room worked just fine, it was only the LG that would drop the signal.So I contacted LG about the problem I was having again, and they said and I quote \"We can't guarantee a constant signal when hooked up to WiFi\"But the router is literally on the other side of the wall, and the house is a small two bedroom... so there shouldn't be an issue. But they refused to help in anyway, they just shrugged their shoulders and repeated themselves saying it is the TV that's the problem but that I should connect it with a cable.After that, I refuse to tell anyone to buy an LG till they fix the issue and I will let all my customers know that I wouldn't touch it. I did let them know of that, and they were fine with it. They really didn't care, so I feel everyone else should know this.However, I will give you an honest opinion about everything else such as picture, 3D, sound...The picture isn't that bad, I still think plasma have a better picture and color, but for a cheap LED it wasn't that bad. However, the black levels was a little poor, and shadows came out looking blue at first. I played with the settings a little, and made it better but still wasn't as deep as some plasma that I like or some higher end LEDs. If I were going to get an LED, I would get one with Local Dimming. The dimming helps with black levels and shadow detailing, so if you are looking at this TV I would go with the GA7600, which has 240hz and dimming. I did put the picture in Vivid and I noticed it helped allot with some of the stuff I was looking at, however when I played Married With Children it made the clothes washed out and blend together. You couldn't see detailing at all, so I had to switch it to Standard to get a somewhat ok picture. I would recommend the ST60 plasma for an amazing picture, deep inky blacks, and better color.The sound is very poor, I have 5.1 surround sound and coming from that to this it was just bad. I like to have bass in my music, I like to hear sounds around me and like things to sound clear. The sound probably is what other TVs sound like, but I had to turn the volume really high just to get it to sound loud and hear definition in the music and vocals. So I would recommend a sound bar with a wired subwoffer just so the sound quality improves.The 3D, is really good. I came from a 2011 Samsung Plasma which I thought was good, but I had problems with the 3D. This LG has Passive 3D, which is what movie theaters use. The other type of 3D is active, which is battery powered glasses that sync with the TV. However, with cheap active 3D you get what is called ghosting, which I can't stand. This would be my first Passive 3D I tested and I loved it, I know with passive you lose some resolution but that I hardly noticed and can live with when watching 3D. I rather it look like 720p than having a two ghostly hands trying to pop out of the TV.I haven't seen what a high class active 3D looks like, and when I do see what a high class active 3D looks like I will update. My fav movie to test out for 3D is either \"My Bloody Valentin 3D\" \"Fright Night 3D\" also I like to test out and see how a video games that has the option in the menu to be played in 3D looks like. When I played Doom 3 in 3D on my old plasma it was extremely ghosty, almost everything had a second image and just looked bad. However, on this it looked great. However, I'm still looking for the TV that will wow me when playing a 2D movie in 3D.I would have gave this TV 3 starts on picture, 2 for sound and 4 for 3D... but overall on how the TV acts with routers and how LG treated me... it dropped itself down to two.", "Date": "August 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Maria Waltner", "ReviewID": "RPA0OYNDJ3WQN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this TV. Love it, love it, LOVE IT.Some background: My previous TV was a 24\" screen size huge tube TV.  It had a pinkish purplish bruise in the upper left-hand corner and would occasionally throw out these weird static lines when other electronic equipment would get close to it. The picture was usually blurry.We hooked up this TV in a matter of minutes.  It guides you through how to do things with the videos that play when you first start it up.  It has an AMAZING picture - I've been noticing things that I would NEVER have noticed on my old TV - stupid things like how the camera angle seems jerky in some spots or dear god was that character there the whole time in that scene?!?!The TV is light and I really love that it is a Google TV.  Want to watch YouTube videos? No problem.  Want to look up the capital of Peru? No big deal.  Want to check out your Facebook while watching Game of Thrones using the picture in picture thingy? Yeah. We got that.Moreover the remote.  Dear god, where have you been all my life?  It's a mouse. It's a microphone. It has a full QWERTY keyboard. Using someone else's remote at their house feels like I have gone back in time.The 3D I am not a huge fan of - it gives me headaches in the theatre so I haven't even tried it at home but the set did come with some pretty sweet 3D glasses.  I am the only one in my home that has this 3D problem though and they seem to like the 3D feature just fine.Every so often someone will say something like, \"Hey did you know the new TV does .....?\" and we're amazed all over again.To recap: I LOVE this TV.", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Home Run For LG", "Author": "Maclen", "ReviewID": "R2SFBLWTYYDO18", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using the LG 42-Inch Cinema 3D LED-LCD HDTV With GoogleTV for a little over a month now and am very happy with its performance.  The picture quality in both 2D and 3D are impressive and the Google TV features are outstanding.Hardware and Set upUnpacking and setting up went quickly.  The TV itself is fairly light - so I had no problem getting it out of the box, installing the stand, and placing it onto my A/V stand.  All of this took me roughly a half hour, even while working slowly.  The stand is attached with 8 screws and are like slick legs in its shape.  The stand does not allow the TV to tilt forwards or backwards but it does rotate from side to side at about a 45 degree angle each way.  The TV itself is very thin, approximately 1.5\", with a dark silver 1\" brushed steel looking outer bezel.  The combination of the TV and stand, to me, looks very sleek and modern which is aesthetically pleasing.The unit has four HDMI inputs, a 1/8\" headphone jack, a digital optical out, three USB 3.0 inputs,  and two 1/8\" jacks for composite and component video signals using the supplied adapter cables. There is an additional 1/8\" jack for the IR blaster adapter -(supplied) for connecting other devices that you would like to be controlled by the LG TV's remote. There is a LAN input for connecting your internet router directly to the TV via an ethernet cable (cable not included) which is what I am doing.  There is also a coax cable input for direct cable or for an OTA antenna.Initial TV starting set up was quick and without any hangups.  It involved things like setting up your location, connecting to the internet, and logging in to your google account (having a google account is required.) The process took about 15 minutes.There are some reviews mentioning the poor quality of the sound from the onboard speakers.  For me, the LG TV replaced a large, 56\" LCD panel and I will say that the sound difference was quite noticeable.  The LG lacked the bass and overall fullness that the larger TV put out.  But honestly, in my case that was to be expected due to the size difference between the two TVs.  After about a day or two of using the LG TV, I had completely forgotten about it.  Some may find the sound a bit thin but overall, I think it's fine.Picture QualityThe images are bright, well saturated, and detailed creating a nice depth in the picture.  I watch quite a bit of fast action sports and I'm very pleased that there was hardly any blurring of the motion.  Watching 3D is also a real pleasure.  I'm using the TV in combination with an LG BP530 3D BluRay player and the 3D imaging is outstanding.  The 3D glasses the TV comes with (four pairs) are light and require no batteries.  I also have 3D glasses for a Samsung TV that require batteries and it's a real hassle when you're in the mood to watch a 3D movie and the batteries need to be recharged.  I wear the LG 3D glasses over a pair of prescription glasses and they fit comfortably on my face.  After a few minutes, I don't even realize they are there.Magic RemoteThe Magic Remote seemed cumbersome at first, probably because of its thickness and odd shape but after using it for a few days, I quickly got used to it.  The QWERTY keyboard on the reverse side of the remote works really well in conjunction with GoogleTV.  I've been using the Chrome browser quite a bit on the TV and the standard keyboard layout is much more convenient than trying to select letters on a screen based keyboard.  I also like that I can use the remote's voice function to navigate to web pages.  Both methods are very accurate.  The remote can also act as a pointer, similar to Wii remote, but I found that to be a bit awkward.  The pointer is quite shaky on the screen so it can be difficult to navigate the pointer to a specific area on the screen, then holding it in that particular spot, then trying to click the scroll wheel.  One feature that I wish the remote had was that the keys were backlit.  Often when using the remote at night, when the room is dark, I have to turn on a light if I want to use the keyboard.GoogleTV and LG Home DashboardOver the past month or so that I've been using the LG Cinema 3D LED TV,  I've noticed myself using it more and more for web surfing via Chrome.  I have all my favorite sites added and just find general web browsing very convenient when using the voice function with the magic remote.  Searching for YouTube videos is equally convenient using this feature.  Speaking of YouTube, the YouTube app is another thing I really like .  The layout of the app and general navigation within the app is much better than the YouTube app on my Samsung 3D SmartTV which doesn't seem as intuitive.  In fact,  the overall layout of LG's Home navigation screen is very well laid out and intuitive.  The icons are large and categorized nicely.  So far, other than web surfing with Chrome, I've mainly used the YouTube app, the Netflix app, and watched some of the included 3D content so I really need to explore more of the GoogleTV capabilities.  That's something I'm definitely looking forward to doing with this TV.The LG 42\" Cinema 3D LED HDTV certainly exceeded my expectations.  The picture is sharp and bright and holds up well when watching fast-paced sports or action movies.  The 3D picture quality is superb and a blast to watch.  The Magic Remote is powerful and pairing it with the convenience of GoogleTV really is a home run.

They jacked the price for that Vizio TV to $1,100.  Since the LG set now was a lot cheaper, I went with the LG TV.PROs:Nice passive 3D (cheap glasses and more usable than active 3D in a bright living room)Plenty of inputs and outputs: 4 HDMI, 3 USB, Optical, Headphone, RCAMost ports are on the side making plugging in cables easyCONs:To set the TV up, internet connection is required and I have to sign into my Gmail account.  There is no other way around this.External USB drives are not registered on the input list.  The only way to play files from external drives is to go the \"HOME\" menu and select \"Photos\".My TV does not play wtv, mts, tp, ts  movie files.There is an option called \"Play Movie\", but it only works with paid content, not from a USB drive.When the TV is turned on, it always searches for the last used USB device and, if none is found, it will display a message asking you to put the device in.  This is very annoying because I want to watch TV when I turn it on, not to watch what's on my USB drive.I knew I won't use the smart/Google TV features, so I figured can just ignore them.  But I was wrong.  By requiring me to sign into my gmail account so I can set my TV just to watch over the air channels, LG has asserted control over my privacy unreasonably.I can't recommend this TV at all.Edit:  My set was made in November 2013 with the latest HDMI specs, yet there is no support for ARC.

I want to love this TV. It has a great set of features, and in my opinion is a pretty good implementation of Google TV. It has a built in CMS for those that want to profile the panel to get the best calibrated color. I usually calibrate my TV's, but I put the LG into ISF mode, turned off all of the motion enhancement, edge sharpening, noise reduction etc etc etc,  and it has a great picture. The Passive 3D works well if you are in the correct viewing angles. In my situation, the TV is on a fireplace mantle, and the 3D is useless.The fault in my set comes from what I have found out is called the \"dirty screen effect\" or DSE. When a bright scene comes on the panel, there are blotchy areas with uneven brightness. Most of the time it is not noticeable... but when a bright solid color covers a large portion of the image it is very visible and distracting. It is one of those things that once you see it, it can't be unseen. From the research I have done, this issue is pretty common with thin panel lcd's. The edge lighting and variation of the light spreading layers in the panel are apparently prone to this.I may call in a repair person to see if there is any chance of getting this fixed, but apparently it is a roll of the dice that a replacement panel may be better or worse...

The second TV had the exact same issue with crashing. LG sent techs who kept the TV for a week and replaced the mainboard. I'm not sure if this fixed the crashing issue as it lead to another issue: the TV could no longer tune to any channels. This was the last straw. I returned the TV two days ago (8/9/2013) and purchased the the Sony KDL-50R550A 50-Inch 120Hz 1080p LED HDTV (Black) and Sony BDP-S5100 3D Blu-ray Disc Player with Wi-Fi.------UPDATE: I have decided to return my 50GA6400 and replace it with the VIZIO M501d-A2R 50-Inch 1080p 240Hz 3D Smart LED HDTV. Whether it's the fault of LG or Google, this device crashes way too frequently. Today alone it crashed 4 times in one hour. This is simply unacceptable. LG sent someone to replace the mainboard of the first device I purchased; but, it did little to resolve the problem. After exchanging that device for another one at my local store, the second one experienced the same issues. I do NOT recommend anyone purchase this device until LG and Google release an update for the software.------Let me start by stating that this is my first television purchase and I will primarily use this device as a large monitor for Netflix and Amazon Video. I don't have cable/satellite/OTA television service and cannot speak to the quality of that feature. I purchased the 50\" model.While I love the hardware and design, excepting the remote, the software leaves a lot to be desired. The first major issue is that the device crashes pretty frequently. While watching a show on Netflix on my Blu-ray player (I'll address Netflix issues later.), the television crashed and restarted itself three times before I could finish the 42 minute episode! I checked the settings and it was only using a third of its allocatable memory. I'm not familiar with Android/Google TV settings so I didn't know what else to check. I eventually gave up and finished the show on my laptop.Why am I using Netflix on my Blu-ray player when the television has a Netflix app? Because TruMotion cannot be disabled for Netflix! I find the name TruMotion rather ironic given that it makes my Netflix videos (\"Breaking Bad\" in this case) appear to be sped up. I can however disable this \"feature\" for an HDMI input. It is also worth pointing out that this device does NOT have Simplink/HDMI-CEC, so I still have to use a separate remote control for my Blu-ray player.The \"magic\" remote seemed pretty cool initially, but I eventually became frustrated with its lack of functionality over time. The red text on the keyboard is very difficult to read and, unless you do a lot of searching, the keyboard itself is pretty much not used. My biggest gripe--which owes more to the software than the hardware--is the fact that the menu button is rather inconsistent depending upon what you are viewing. For example, when viewing TV or an input, I have access to various video and sound settings. If I am using an app such as Netflix, these settings are nowhere to be found.I really want to like this device. I picked it up for a bargain ($899), it has a beautiful design, and, at least on paper, has all the functionality I want--3D, Netflix, Amazon Video. I can work around the TruMotion issue (at the expense of a Blu-ray player [LG Electronics BP530 Blu-ray Disc Player with Wi-Fi]); but, frequent crashing is a deal breaker. I will exchange mine for another unit just in case I got a lemon; but, if problems continue to occur, I am done with this line and, perhaps, LG.", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "as long as last longer then the last one I love it", "Author": "kenneth kirby", "ReviewID": "R2B2BQXNM3AXX4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This my 2nd one the first one I waited 2 months for parts to get here from tiwan.

The next day I receive an \"update request\", I went forward with the update thinking maybe it can resolve some of the issues I was having. Although, the update help some, there was obviously still issues. For starter, Netflix .. I don't know how many times it has crashed on me and ever so often maybe a few days I would have to re-enter my account information. Applications, you are very limited with apps .. I can't even get Hulu. Don't bother trying to web stream shows through Chrome because chances are, you are going to get a TON of ads that you can't even exit out of, surprise Adblock is NOT an available app to download. Only useful Apps for me since I can't web stream is \"PlayOn\" which is free for Google TV. Appearance wise, I hate the look of the stand but it appears to be pretty sturdy. Audio, yes you would definitely a sound bar for this .. I would have to crank up volume to 90 half of the time but, I'm not too worried about it right now. 3D is pretty good, I could care less but it was a must for my husband.

I am very disappointed in it and feel I should have gotten the LA6200 instead. I bought this TV specifically for the google tv functionality especially to use plex, but I have realised that none of the built in apps utilizes trumotion.As much as others hate trumotion but I buu TV's specifically which have the feature. To have it built in but not being able to use it with apps is a big disappointment. To have Plex and be able to turn on trumotion I will now need to buy a Roku box and hook that up.Google tv on a whole while interesting is so much below it's potential it's not funny. If I had it to do again, I'd get the LA6200 and a Roku instead of putting hopes in google tv.Another disappointment is that to get to the picture settings is a tedious affair. The setting is buried quite far which is silly, as that's something most users will access regularly. The setting is also non existent for some video playing apps like Plex. You can only adjust picture settings while a video is playing, and to access the setting, plex stops playing...silly.Picture quality is good but black levels do disappoint.My advice, get the LA6200 and call it a day. It has a superior image and at the end of the day, we spend more time watching tv than fiddling with its apps.To add, 3D looks great, 2D to 3D worka wonderfully, but again, within apps, you can't turn on 3D just 2D to 3D. So playing a SBS in plex is useless as you can't set it to SBS mode.The remote is nice, but again, fails to live up to its potential.

Bad: magic remote is anything but. Ugly: wifi fail.", "Author": "AJ", "ReviewID": "R2EJZBMTH677WO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My equipment: DirecTV HD DVR, LG 3D Bluray player, PS3.  Setup:  Took less than 15 minutes from opening the box to watching TV. Very simple and easy for one person alone.The Good: the picture is truly gorgeous. I upgraded from a 1080i HDTV from Panasonic and the difference is huge.  This TV makes my old one look like standard definition by comparison.  And the 3D is pretty cool too.  The ability to make anything you're watching 3D with just the press of a button is a novelty that has yet to wear off.  Obviously it's not as impressive compared to something that was filmed in 3D, but it's a lot better than I was expecting.  We tried it out with Finding Nemo on TV and everyone was grinning at the result.  4 pairs of glasses come with this TV, but we had a few pairs from movie theaters and they worked perfectly too. I also tried the auto 3D while playing Assassins Creed 3 on my PS3 and it was amazing. I don't think I'll ever play a game in 2D again.The Bad: the remote is about as elegant as a brick.  The shape feels very awkward in the hand, and while the full keyboard is helpful if you want to search the Internet etc, it's not really kid friendly as they'll inadvertently push buttons from both sides by squeezing too hard.  The motion control is good though and the voice command is very accurate.  Still, I wasted no time updating my Harmony Touch and ditching this remote.  Neither the motion control nor voice control are necessary and I vastly prefer my universal remote to this brick.  Also, if you plan on using the 'Magic Remote' to control your cable/satellite box, you'll have to attach two corded IR Blasters (included but an eyesore) to the top of your box.The Ugly: the initial setup worked fine.  The onscreen wizard was quick and easy to connect to my home wifi and my google account (which is mandatory in order to use the Google TV features). I played around with the various Google TV apps and browser (both very cool, though the lack of a Hulu app was disappointing).  Within 30 minutes, however, it stopped detecting my network.  It froze trying to re-establish a connection.  I ended up restarting the setup, and it failed completely.  When it would detect my network, it wouldn't connect saying it was out of range (it connected fine before and both my DVR and PS3 connected in the same room without a problem).  I ended up having to use a bridge and connect via an ethernet cord.  I have no idea what was causing the problem. The included manual wasn't any help and online info was equally scant.Overall, as a 3D TV, it's great.  As a Smart TV with apps and Internet...not so much if you want to connect wirelessly.  Other reviewers noted that the sound quality is less than stellar, but I have no complaints.  The remote is pretty awful, so I highly recommend using a universal remote like the Logitech Harmony series.", "Date": "May 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best tv ever", "Author": "S.

Of course with the new technology and upgrades since then this new tv is simply the best tv with the most value for my money.Ill come back to add more but the tv screen is phenomenal.Now....one negative mark. I had spent a day and half going between Verizon and LG to resolve wny the tv didn't connect wirelessly to my home network. There's nothing in the manual about wireless network requirements but I KNEW it had to be Verizon but they insisted that it wasn't them and something that LG did. I googled and asked many of my techie friends for all kinds of  possible solutions until one Verizon tech in one last desperate call was knowledgeable to point out that I may need to switch from WEP to WPA wireless security. I used a second router to test this and my tv connected right away to the WPA setup.I'm posting this info about the wireless connection to help people from a lot of headaches and misunderstandings.Google tv alone is awesome and I alo enjoyed the 3D viewing. You also get a free LG soundbar which lets you connect your own phone or ipods...how much more sweeter can this get?Going from a 46 inch to a 55 inch may not seem like a big jump but it IS a big jump in terms of screen size.I also read that Verizon will work with LG about some channels that are viewable without a cable box. Not sure how this works or if I have the full info right (google it) but the way the tv integrates the channels is really NICE.I played a few PS3 games on it and its great. I was never really into my son and wifes lego games but I loved playing Lego Batman 2 on the tv. I actually thought it would not look good or be a bit too much but it looks great. Tried my Batman Arkham Asylum game in 3D mode...wow.

First let me say that I already have an LG 47LA6200, that I dearly love. And the magic remote is great. But we are talking about LG 47GA6400 here and this is a Google TV. Quite frankly, I did not know the difference so I will point out the major difference that I see. With a regular smart TV you plug in the HDMI Cable from the TV to the Cable box and you are done. With Google TV you plug in the HDMI cable from the TV to the cable box, but it does not control the cable box. You cannot use the magic remote with qwerty keyboard to change channels unless you install the IR Blaster. This blaster looks like two audio cables with silver dollar size sensors at one end that you plug into the TV, then dangle them down the wall and let them hang some where near your cable box remote sensor. Now if you have a wall installation, as I have, you don't want wires dangling down the wall. Tough! You have simply bought the wrong TV. There is no work around. Why the cable box does not work thru the HDMI cable, I do not know. Ergo the title, beware the dreaded IR blaster. That said, I do like the qwerty keyboard, which is why I bought the lemon in the first place.

The premium apps card can't be deleted, the smart share tab works sometimes.The television has crashed a handful of times...Oh...HDMI CEC (SimpLink) does not work on this TV. I know the documentation says it works, but it's wrong. It is a standard functionality in even the lowest end television but LG can't be bothered to put it in here.I would avoid this television. If you must have GoogleTV buy a set top box. If you must have a smart tv, buy a set top box. Do not waste money on integrated smart TVs. They will be obsolete before the hardware in the television. A $100 set top box can be replaced 5-6 times what this TV is worth in hardware. It just doesn't make sense. i'm stuck with this TV, you don't have to be.

Very good picture quality. Very good 3D. Option to change the picture quality depending upon source.2. Prime time is great for searching any movie for streaming or rent from Netflix or Amazon or Google Play store and shows all the available options if you name the movie or show. Google voice search is scaringly real.3.You can control two other devices with the remote but will have to run wires to them from the TV.4. The Youtube app is fantastic and built in much different than other TVs. You can directly search for you tube content  with google voice.5. 'Send to phone' extension in chrome browser will instantly send the webpage that you have on currently in your laptop to the TV screen.BAD STUFF:1. Awful sound.....almost no bass.2. I finally returned the TV to the store because there was an almost half second lag between the sound and picture. This can be corrected by adjusting the AV synchronization settings if you play the sound from TV speakers only (which suck), but it was impossible to bear when I used my DVD home theater speakers.3. Although there are more than a thousand Google TV optimized apps in the Play store that you can search on the computer and directly download to the TV, 99.99% are useless. There is no Hulu or Vudu or Blockbuster on demand. Not a big deal since these are available on any smart dvd or roku etc.4. The webbrowser is great for routine stuff, but cannot stream any online movies if they don't run in the old Flash player format. You cannnot install any chrome extensions and hence cannot upgrade the Flash player or install microsoft silverlight.5. There is a headhphone jack, which is great. BUT its built in the back, so would be impossible to reach it.6. Does't look very sleek.  Almost one inch of silver bezel all around the screen.7. LG website description of this TV clearly states that NFC Tagon stickers can be used for sharing content with a smart phone, but the sticker is not provided with the TV and none of LG tech support had any idea about it. This a misrepresentation from LG for this series. The NFC feature is available and comes with the other nonGoogle TV versions of their new series of TVs.In conclusion, the AV synch delay was the deal killer.

HBOGO and other streaming apps mostly work, but are cumbersome to navigate and the apps are prone to buffering issues as well as outright hanging. HBOGO, for example has always worked great on our tablets, but the four movies we've watched with HBOGO on this new LG GA6400 were incredibly frustrating to get through. You never know if your show will start back up if you pause ... so far it's success rate is about 20%. You can eventually get back to around where you left off, but only after using the progress bar a few times to jump back and forth. I also found that the sound will intermittently go in and out and the only way to dislodge the app is to change the view to/from fullscreen and/or to jump forward and backward to refresh the buffer.:-/The \"Smart Share\" (media sharing) app is a sophomoric attempt at an integrated media player. If you have any kind of extensive media library you'll find that Smart Share is terrible to navigate with and also has trouble crawling/updating from the DLNA server. I'm sure it works great if you have 2 albums, a couple avi movies, and a dozen or so pics of your grandma, but it's not good for much more than that. Also, I noticed a few places where the GUI text had less than proper English, which furthers my belief that this TV wasn't quite ready when it shipped. That sort of thing is all too common these days. Perhaps LG will fix many of these software/firmware issues down the road, but I doubt it. This tv runs a fairly ancient version of Android (Honeycomb 3.2), so if they were on top of things I'd have expected something a little more fresh than that. Nevertheless, I might be willing to take the risk of no updates if the interface and apps were at least snappy. The tv feels really slow already, so imagine how slow and annoying it will be 5+ years from now!This LG tv validated for me some of the key problems with \"Smart\" tv's ... you're paying a big premium for gee-whiz tech that's not upgradeable and is basically frozen in time. As a guy who tends to use stuff until it breaks, I could see myself keeping this thing for the next 5-10 years so being slow now would be maddening in a few years.Samsung Smart tvs are much better imho, and the 2012 year-end deals for Samsungs are pretty good right now.
