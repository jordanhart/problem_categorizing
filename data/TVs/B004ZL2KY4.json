{"Reviews": [{"Title": "GREAT picture, mediocre sound, cheap remote, lots of inputs", "Author": "Goldengate \"Goldengate\"", "ReviewID": "RYYOIZMH2QSCL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Since there are no reviews yet for this product, I'm going to write this review sooner than I normally would and then update after I've lived with this TV for a while.  My unit was damaged in shipping but a replacement is on the way courtesy of Amazon so I am using it in the meantime.  Like other reviews I've read for this size, I'm choosing a 37\" unit because it fits in my cabinet perfectly.  If I did not have that constraint, I would definitely purchase a 42\" as there are many more choices in that size range from more brands.  As a point of reference, I own 4 year old Sony Bravia LCD TV also and have been very happy with that TV and brand.  If Sony made this size I would have purchased another Sony.Here are my thoughts on this TV...Pro's:- The picture.  Stunning.  Really great picture.  Smooth.  Looks at least as good if not better than the Sony in the other room.  Great performance on high speed motion shots.- Menus and navigation.  Very intuitive, easy to use and navigate.  I haven't had to use the manual once.  Easy plug and play.- Size.  Nice and thin.  Easy swivel stand.  Looks very modern.- Lots of connections in the back.  They are listed on the Amazon product page so I won't repeat here, but pretty much whatever you need is on the back... plenty of HDMI ports, etc.  Fast HDMI switching when you go between inputs.Negatives:- I think at this price point, some sort of internet connectivity should be included.  If this were in the $450 range I'd get it, but at the current price, I'm left thinking this isn't the greatest value.- Sound.  WOW.  Most reviewers on most LCD TV's complain about the sound.  I assumed that things were getting better and that sound would be at least as good as my four year old Sony.  Not so.  It's worse.  No base and just disappointing sound.  I know that most people hook these up to external speakers, but if you're looking for a set where you don't need to do that, you might want to keep shopping.- The remote.  CHEAP.  Seriously, the free remote from Comcast is nicer.  Come on, Vizio, invest a little in the remote.  Most people at this price point and size aren't going to be buying a universal remote I'm guessing.  Would be nice to have something better.  The buttons are very small, poorly laid out, and do not illuminate.  I'll be using my Comcast and Apple TV remotes but be warned, this remote is disappointing.Overall it feels like this TV should be in the 450 price range and likely I'm guessing it will be promoted down to that once it's been on the market a little while (it's brand new as I'm writing this).  Again, I need this for a specific sized cabinet so I'm going to keep it.  True, the most important thing is excellent picture, which this TV has, but these days we consumers expect a bit more, like decent sound and a remote that's not so Fisher Price.  This reminds me of a TV I'd see in a hotel room.  At this price I think you can probably do better.Hope this is helpful.UPDATE 6/25... so the \"dent\" in the front speaker is a design feature!?!  Amazon replaced the original unit with another Vizio which has the dent in the same place, right next to the Vizio logo on the front... you can see it on the Amazon page if you zoom into this area.  One of my friends described the dent as looking really cheap.  I'll have to see if I get used to it but think it's a ridiculous design feature on the speaker in a very visible location.Update 6/28: I added a modestly-priced Logitech sound system Logitech THX-Certified Speaker System Z623 and I'm really pleased with it... the TV remote adjusts the volume level on the Logitech when plugged into the jack on the back of the TV, and it makes for a nice system with great quality sound.Update 1/22/2012: Six months later and this TV is still going strong (it better be, I can't return it anymore!)... I continue to be impressed by the stunning picture... it really is amazing.  Bright and clear.  I'm still happy with my purchase.  I wanted to provide an update as when I was looking for Vizio's it seemed like there were reviews that mentioned there were reliability issues.  So far so good and I hope I haven't just jinxed myself!", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Picture with the latest LED technology.", "Author": "SLFNYC64 \"NYCSOFTWAREMAN\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZBEZKA2V0IL3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This VIZIO E370VP is an Edge Lit 1080p LED LCD HDTV. I am basing this review solely on the $400 price that I paid for a refurbished unit. If I had paid the full $600 retail price VIZIO.com asks for a new unit. Then the review would probably have been that it's not worth the money. But I would only say that because there's no internet connectivity and it only has a 60 MHz Refresh rate. Most LCD HDTVs in the $600 price range have Wi-Fi and/or a 120 MHz refresh rate. The higher the refresh rate the less likely you are to see blurring in fast moving picture sources.Since Vizio sells their TVs mostly through TARGET & WALMART and I don't live near either store. I was unable to find a VIZIO TV in the stores I would normally buy a TV from. So I bought this unit online, sight unseen. This meant using only online information to decide my purchase. Vizio answered any questions I had quickly and informatively. The TV arrived safely and attachted securely to its stand with only one screw and without the need for any tool.I was concerned about it being refurbished. Especially since there are so many refurb Vizio units for sale. The TV looked like new, the only way I knew it was refurbished was when I registered it at VIZIO.COM. My 90 day warranty from VIZIO was then activated once I registered. If I had bought it new , the warranty would be one year.Vizio calls this the \"RAZOR\" model. The picture truly is razor sharp. It is a 1080p LED \"Edge Lit LED\" TV. This means it is supposed to be more energy efficient. As well as providing a brighter and sharper picture. It is easy see the improved picture benefits of the LED technology on the VIZIO E370VP. The LED HDTVs are also much thinner than the LCDs. The EV370P has a depth of only 1.9 inches and weighs just 20lbs. When you first turn on the Vizio EV370P it will find and recognize your connected components. This allows the TV to automatically switch to the desired input that matches the component in use. Most HDTV's only do this with components that are of the same brand as the TV.I also own a 3 year old 32\" SAMSUNG. When looking at both TVs using the same picture source. I could clearly see how much more accurate the EV370P picture was. The colors were bolder and more accurate. The picture is sharper, brighter, and has better contrast . The viewing angle is perfect from any place in the room you watch it. There are just so many picture settings it would take an entire page to describe them all. The manual is well written ,but doesn't go into any technical detail about what most of the advanced picture settings actually do.My favorite of all the various picture controls is the \"ADAPTIVE LUMINA\". Which as four different settings. Although the manual doesn't give much detail of what this does. When set to on while watching a very dark picture source. You will see the contrast become much more detailed. I noticed deeper blacks and brighter whites. Which is exactly what Vizio claims the E370VP offers.One very important setting is the FILM MODE. This is more commonly known as the 24fps setting. (24 frames per second) If you want the \"look of film\", then 24p setting is important, because it reproduces the 24fps of the theater. If you are a blu ray video viewer, then this setting will make your movies look smoother and more film like.As opposed to looking like the movie was shot on video. This should be a standard feature in all HDTVS ,but it's not. It was the main reason I choose this TV over others for the price I paid.My least favorite of all the picture settings are those it has for individual sports. Such as GOLF, BASKETBALL, etc. I didn't find these settings accurate at all. I would rather just set it to \"custom\" and adjust the controls individually. There are color temperature controls to adujst the red, green and blue colors indepedent of the basic color control. I found lowering the red setting produced the best results. This made the color red is more accurate without affecting the overall color intensity of the picture. The Vizio E370VP has an ambient light sensing technology that automatically adjusts backlight levels based on the lighting in the room. When the room is very dark I set that to on. So the brightness is not too overwhelming.The remote is small and fits in the palm of your hand. It will also automatically control your Blu-Ray/DVD player and some cable boxes. Some users may feel it's cheap looking. But I prefer the more compact sized remotes. The audio as on most of the new thinner LED/LCD TV's leaves something to be desired. But it does have SRS HD Surround Sound, and a customizable five band equalizer. The TV has an optical audio output for connection to a soundbar or a receiver. There are no RCA audio output connections, but there is a mini-jack headphone input. Among the important video connectivity inputs there are three HDMI inputs and one USB input.Thes VIZIO E370VP has a fantastic picture with enough different picture controls to keep even the serious picture tweaker happy. For the $400 price I paid it is a great deal. But if you are spending $600, then I would look at the VIZIO XVT373SV 37-Inch Full HD 1080P LED LCD HDTV 120 HZ with VIA Internet Application, Black for that price. That model is also LED with WI-Fi and a 120Mhz refresh rate. If wi-fi and internet apps are an important feature to you, and you dont want to spend $600. Then you could always purchase the \"ROKU\" which is a device that will allow your TV to receive streaming internet apps. Amazon sells the 720p version for $50.00 and the 1080p version for $60.00.Roku 2 XD Streaming Player 1080p", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV", "Author": "N.
