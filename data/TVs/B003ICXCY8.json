Picture quality is high, particularly for a screen of this size. Predictably, the sound is a bit weak (you can easily amend this by hooking up speakers via the headphone jack, however). Philips is a solid brand - it's always worth it to pursue a reputable product - and the aesthetics of the TV are great; the design and build quality are fantastic.If you're searching for a nice HDTV for a bedroom or small room, this is among the best options.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect for the kids' room", "Author": "Mike IGC", "ReviewID": "R2M2JH5V8FT7F8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great TV.  Lightweight, easy to assemble the base, and hooked it up very quickly.  I'm not using a cable box, so I had to autoprogram the channels.  The picture looks great.  Extremely busy patterns appear to move and turn grainy even on an HD channel, but I've only seen that happen once.  Both HD and SD channels look fine - no complaints.Great feature: Channel list/skip.  Many of the channels are duplicates or they're in languages that we don't speak.  While in the channel skip menu, you can preview each channel as you run down the list.  My 32\" TV from another brand doesn't have this feature.Sound: I continue to adjust the equalizer to try to get it to sound \"normal\".  It's not that bad once you lower the 2nd of the 5 EQ bands and fiddle around with the others.Since I'm running the cable directly in and have strange and out-of-order channels like 52.9, 66.20, 71.707, 74.641, 102.248, etc., I would have liked a \"Favorite channel\" feature or at least a manual channel labeler.  The remote is logically laid out and feels solid.Overall, I really do like the TV and have already recommended it to others.", "Date": "March 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Works Great So Far!", "Author": "Lance", "ReviewID": "R2PMFNGRGLS25I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this tv for about a week. I bought it for a home exercise room. Set up was easy. Even if you use basic cable it should pull in the HD channels. I know that Time Warner does. The only issue that I ran into is connecting my Roku box to it. You have to go through the second HDMI input and not the first. If you go through the second, the HDMI cable will carry the audio and video signals to the tv. I connected a DVD player and video player to it easily. I also suggest that if you have a spare set of computer speakers that you connect them through the headphone jack. The only issue is the tiny light at the botton which as one reviewer noted is extremely bright. I guess I will either get used to it or tape it over. Otherwise this was a great buy and an excellent choice for a small room or a children's bedroom.", "Date": "February 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Television", "Author": "Linda Mabus", "ReviewID": "RKQYO89FGLFC6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The television arrived as expected and was easy to setup and use.

I like the smaller footprint of this TV, but when watching SD TV, the picture honestly looked better on the old 4:3 Trinitron.  I picked up this TV for much less than the ~$198 price on Amazon and am glad I didn't pay that much for it.  Pretty middle of the road in my opinion - No real stand-out qualities, but also no fatal flaws.**Pros*** Smaller footprint/lighter than a CRT* 2 HDMI inputs* VGA input for using as a computer monitor* Basic - Not overwhelming with options/functions.**Cons*** Like many smaller flatscreen TVs, this has small speakers that aren't front-facing.* Composite jack (Red-White-Yellow) is on the side, making the cables for older connections visible.* Bright white power light (located directly under the \"PHILIPS\" text on the front of the display) makes it seem like someone is shining a flashlight at you.  Easy enough to cover up though, so this is a minor complaint.Finally, just because I had a hard time finding this info...If you have Dish Network, I used code \"651\" to pair this with my 6.0 IR/UHF Pro remote (listed on the back of the Dish Network remote). To pair this TV to that remote, hold the TV button on the upper left of Dish Network remote until the top 4 buttons light up, then press 6+5+1 then #.  The TV button should flash 3 times, after which you can control the TV's power and volume from your Dish remote.  If the 651 code didn't work for you, here are the other suggested codes that I found for pairing that remote to Philips-brand TVs: 525, 566, 651, 652, 655, 656, 671, 690, 723, 724, 729.

Unfortunatly, you arn't going to find ANY 19\" with great sound so this TV compares at middle of the road.  The Vizio 19\" is an exception but not great for wall mounting.  This TV is acceptable for our application.-Changing channels can be frusterating because there is about a 1-2 second delay from when you change the station to when the picture actually appears.  Not a huge deal but a little annoying when trying to find something on.-Can't label the stations.

Gilliam", "ReviewID": "R2IPN9HV1E7TRP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'm returning this TV because it can't display the composite output of my Sony VCR properly. The picture jumps up and down slightly, or it jumps back and forth between full and half its vertical resolution. It seems like this TV can't align the separate interlaced parts of the NTSC signal properly. No manual adjustment makes any difference. It happens even with newly recorded material. My VCR works perfectly with two different CRT TV's, so there's nothing wrong with my VCR. The TV's composite input works fine with my satellite TV receiver and my digital camera. Don't buy this TV if you want to use it with a VCR.According to the DDC info the TV sent to my computer, this TV supports up to 1920x1080 signals at 60Hz. But I couldn't get it to display analog VGA signals higher than 1360x768. (Its native resolution is 1366x768.) This shouldn't be a problem unless you want to do a multi-monitor set-up and your video card can't run different monitors at different resolutions.I had no reception problems with digital broadcast TV as long as my rabbit ears were aligned properly for the station. I'm just outside a major city, though.Like all LCD displays, the black isn't as dark as a good CRT. This TV's black is lighter than my ViewSonic 24\" LCD computer monitor.The TV has a power-saving backlight feature. It causes annoying brightness fluctuations with my VCR's playback on both composite and RF inputs, but it can be turned off. There's no other way to dim the backlight, though. The brightness adjustment doesn't change the backlight.A quarter inch around the edge of the screen is brighter than the rest of the screen when displaying black. I understand this is due to the edge lighting and is common on LCD TV's. It isn't normally noticeable.You can mask channels so you won't see them while channel-surfing. (There are lots of religious and Spanish channels on digital TV.)The zoom setting perfectly corrects letterboxed 4:3 content. The 16:9 setting corrects some broadcasts that are clearly at the wrong aspect ratio (squished).The speakers have very poor bass, but that's to be expected with a TV this size. The TV has a headphones connection so you can easily hook it up to an audio amp and big speakers. There's also a digital audio output. Listening to digital TV on my high-quality headphones, the audio quality is mediocre. Even with the TV's equalizer adjusted, both the bass and high end are weak compared to a CD player or computer.The power light on the front is white and very bright. If I kept this TV, I'd definitely put a piece of tape over it.For the 6 people who care, it works perfectly with my antique Atari 800 computer which outputs an RF NTSC signal on channel 2 or 3. (Joust was a great game.)The manual is available in PDF format at the Philips Web site.I would've been happy with this TV if it weren't for the incompatibility with VCR's.Update: I've decided to keep the TV because I realized that I could use an old VCR to convert the composite signal to NTSC RF which this TV displays correctly. There are also converters available for under US$20. Search for \"RF modulator.\" This is a better option than returning the TV.Update: There seems to be a problem with the red/green/blue balance. A sea green color looks blue. Adjusting the tint to correct it makes the flesh tones wrong. I had this problem with a CRT and was able to fix it by adjusting the RGB dials inside the TV. There's no RGB adjustment in the menus of this TV, only tint which is insufficient. It's not a big deal to me, but if you're a stickler for color accuracy....", "Date": "December 24, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "2 HDMI inputs\nPC input via VGA\nLED - edgelit\nPixel Plus HD\nEnergy Star 4.0", "Name": "Philips 19PFL4505D/F7 19-Inch 720p LED LCD HDTV, Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nSa1jQEJL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003ICXCY8"}}
