{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Impressive HDTV. Big bang for the buck!", "Author": "Quentin", "ReviewID": "R1HMIENEBP1V6M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this HDTV for a week and am completely satisfied with it. The picture quality is top notch and the set is easy to operate. There are plenty of inputs for other components and I use many of them already. Over the air 1080i HDTV from the major networks and PBS is amazing, it's hard to believe broadcasts of this quality are free. Standard DVDs played in our upconverting Sony DVP-NS77H upconverting player are very good, of course not Blu-ray/1080p quality but way better than they looked on our old SDTV.The screen is bright and the colors are nearly perfect. My wife and I still can't believe how good this TV is. When you see rear projection sets in the store they don't look that impressive, especially next to a 58\" plasma flat panel but once you get it home you won't be sorry. I can't imagine paying $4500 for a plasma this size when you get so much for under $1400.The geometric distortion problems of last year are greatly improved with the stronger and deeper cabinet. Not much wrong with this model at all. Of course take a look at the HLxxA750 LED models as well. They're a bit more expensive but the LED light engine will save you money down the road. I liked the PQ of the A650 slightly better and figured the cheaper price would offset the cost of a lamp replacement a few years from now.I bet you'll love this Samsung!", "Date": "June 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "perfection", "Author": "L.

D. Mitchell", "ReviewID": "R320HFQMRPE44G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been eyeing up a Sammy DLP set for quite some time.  I initially planned on getting the Samsung HLT6187S for the 61 inch goodness and the LED light source.  However, as I continued to procrastinate the price of those sets began to rise as they became harder and harder to find.  At that point I thought I may as well jump up to the HL61A750 since it is the successor to my dream TV.  Well, unfortunately my old lady voiced her opinion that the 61 inch was \"too big\" for our modest apartment, but said she backed up my decision either way.  But me being the sensitive man I am I couldn't stand to make her unhappy and grudgingly started looking for a 56 incher.My searches would soon bring me face to face with the glorious glow of the Samsung HL56A650.  Honestly, if they had a LED powered 56 incher in this series I would have gotten that one instead.  I can imagine the reason for this was to lower the price to increase market saturation but I wish they could at least had both versions or a maybe an LED upgrade kit (does that even exist or did I just make that up?).I had a DLP projector a few years back and I've priced the lamps for the TV and they are MUCH cheaper than the ones for my old projector.  Even so I was considering buying a replacement lamp and keeping it in the closet when the stock lamp eventually dies so 1) I can capitalize on the lower price while they are in abundance and 2) I won't be weeks without my pretty tv while I wait for the replacement to come in the mail.Alright enough babble, onto the actual TV itself, I order the TV the 16th, and received it on the 24th.  CEVA only sent one person out with the TV so being the testosterone filled he-man that I am, I offered to help him bring it up to our 3rd floor apartment.  After careful inspection of the unit and waiting for me to be satisfied, he took all the packaging to the garbage after I told him I didn't have space to store it in case of it being defective.  The TV settings were so-so out of the box but after using the calibration disc we picked up previously Digital Video Essentials: HD Basics [Blu-ray] the picture was outstanding once we threw on a bluray disc.The television is very attractive even when its not turned on, with its stylish piano black finish and thin bezel.  Any other 56 inch tv would overpower our living room but the design of the tv allows it to stay amazing low key.  Then you turn the picture on and POW!  Your eyeballs explode from resolution overload.  The remote is pretty slick looking as well, with a piano black finish that matches the TV (and the PlayStation 3 80GB Motorstorm Pack).I actually thought I was going to be underwhelmed by the sound quality and want a home theater system immediately but I have been pleasantly surprized.  Not that the speakers are that great, but they get the job enough that I can allow my wallet to recover the beating buying this behemoth has done before I invest in completing my home theater set up.  One thing that kind of surprized me about this tv was that even though there are 3 hdmi hookups, there is only one antenna hook up which I forgot all about.  I was actually anticipating hooking an antenna up to the second port to get some free high def channels.Other than those couple of gripes I really have nothing bad to say about the television.  The main reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the lack of an LED light source or even an option for one in the 56 inch model.  But don't let that be a deal breaker, this is a great tv that gives you more picture for buck than LCD or plasma.", "Date": "June 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Cracker Jack", "Author": "DragonFly", "ReviewID": "RVMAFZ3TE5C2E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "They call you cracker jack when you are very good or the best. My ratings are on a scale of 1-10.9-Color/Viewing Angles: May need a little adjustment for individual preference. Flesh tones and such were a little off until adjusted. Blacks are good. View angles are really good. Excels in a dark room as well as with most of the shades up.10-Size: The TV great for big room(16ft x 26ft). Quick access buttons to size choices of picture 16.9, 4.3, zoom 1x & 2x etc.10-Hookup: Lots of different hookups. Everything form PC hookups to plenty of HDMI hookups for your Blu-Ray players. Perfect for the techy, but may be confusing for some people not accustom to having so many choices, but the manual explains it fairly well for any questions you may have.10-Interface: The interface is very user-friendly and it does take long to adapt to. Actual selection menus are used and navigated with the arrow keys instead of just button clicks, and we also like the sound notifications of it when it's turned it off.We really can't say anything bad about the TV works great, has plenty of connections for just about anything you can imagine, and has a great picture.Shipping service was a little slow, probably due to the holiday during the delivery cycle, but the TV was handled very well. Shipping was free, so we can't complain.

We originally had a really nice Toshiba DLP, but it developed enough issues over 2 yrs time, and 3-4 tech warranty visits that Frye said, \"Here you go, here's THIS Samsung TV that we are replacing your Toshiba with\".  Had previously researched the Toshiba before buying, and were THRILLED with it, until \"issues\" started creating REGULAR tech visits.The replacement Samsung (your model here) caught me off guard as it was offered all of a sudden in a \"take it or leave it way\", and I didn't have any time to research it, since I wasn't expecting a DIFFERENT BRAND as a replacement.Anyhow ...this Samsung has an INCREDIBLE PICTURE, and it was never even calibrated.  We were both amazed and thankful, as we were scared this replacement might not have as good of an image as the previous Toshiba.  We had this Samsung about 18 months, and then the bulb blew.  No warning. Found a local bulb vendor, and carefully replaced it. We bought the bulb that's ALREADY ENCASED in its housing, as its a LOT EASIER installing/removing.  That bulb lasted about 3 months. Got another bulb (under vendor's warranty).  It lasted about 2.5 months, and it was suggested that maybe we were buying \"factory seconds\" bulbs at a discounted price.  Switched vendors, and started blowing bulbs EVERY 2 months.  Whenever we replaced the bulb, the picture went right back to being FANTASTIC.Fast forward 8-10 months, and another 3-4 bulbs. Then we started getting the tiny white dots down both left/right sides of the screen. Started with 2-3 dots on each side, and 3 weeks later, we have 25-30 sots per side.  TIME FOR A NEW TV, as we know the cost to fix the bulb (power or ballast issue) is cost prohibitive, and the dot problem throws more $ on an already pricey problem.My advice .... If you are viewing this TV as only a 2-3 year purchase, get it. You'll LOVE the clear picture.  BUT DEFINITELY CONSIDER BUYING A WARRANTY THROUGH SOMEONE LIKE SQUARE TRADE WARRANTY, as they are much more AFFORDABLE as a warranty, and yet just as good as the inflated ones the big box stores are pushing on you.

Originally, I was unsure about purchasing a television online (especially with not knowing how the picture would be, the risk of damage, etc.).  When this TV arrived, it came in a huge box (so huge it would NOT fit inside a vehicle, only in the back of a pick-up truck).  Please be sure to send this TV to the exact address you plan to view it at - transporting it may be a problem due to it's size.  The picture quality is amazing (better than LCD) and the price was out of this world great.  Trust me, you're a fool to purchase an LCD.  This TV even comes HD ready, has all the outputs/inputs and NO EXTRA CORDS OR ITEMS ARE NEEDED to enjoy an HD experience. The sound was great too!  I have had this TV for 2.5 years now and still have the same great picture and sound quality.  The only \"difference\" from this TV and an LCD is the back.. this one isn't flat, but it's slim.... basically, a small bump on the back. It cannot be hung from a wall, but trust me, a TV this size shouldn't be.  You won't be sorry.

Of course you need dlp shutter glasses (goggles, lol) an emmiter which comes with the pack of glasses ( if you order the kit with the emmiter) and a 3d bluray movie and a 3d bluray player and unfortunately the only player I have found to work is the panasonic 3d bluray player which has a checkerboard playback feature. its a Panasonic DMP-BDT300 or the DMP-BDT350. Good luck finding them or you can purchase a converter made by tru 3d ([...]).It's a good thing that now they've made 3d dlp glasses that are not overly priced made by 3DTV Corp(which you can find here on amazon) If you buy this tv you will be very happy and you get all of the bang for your buck and remember this can also be better in comparison to plasma or lcd in some cases led, because these tv's don't burn out,(this is my personal opinion I also respect anyone else's) the lamp is the only thing you need to replace when it goes out.

The first one was basically DOA. Worked for about an hour, then lost picture (no, the timer was not on). Then it would not turn off, had to unplug it to turn it off. Plugged it back in and it was still in the on mode and started making a buzzing sound, I was ready for it to catch on fire. Took it right back and got another one, this one works ok other than the color wheel makes an annoying high pitched sound, like a dog whistle. Drives you nuts. Called Samsung and got a very unhelfpul person who sounded like she was 10 and was clueless and yawned on me while I was talking to her. Too bad this tv has issues because becasue the picture is stunning. The store is all out of them so I am either stuck with it or taking it back for a smaller LCD for more money. I wish Amazon sold this and not through one of their re-sellers, I only deal with amazon. 56 inches is perfect size for me and DLP is best bang for your buck. I would try an LED version but Samsung no longer makes the 56 inch in LED.UPDATE- 11/18/08Rec'd another set today hoping that the first set was just defective. Well this set also makes the same high pitched noise. It comes from the color wheel, not the fan. Maybe the people who do not hear this have a hearing problem or I just have good ears (my wife also hears it and finds it annoying). After about an hour it gives you a headache and when you turn the TV off it is such a sound of relief. It is a shame because the picture is beautiful but the annoying sound this TV makes makes it un-watchable. Guess I will have to settle for a smaller 52 inch LCD.

Vertical angles can be a problem if you are too far above or below the actual screen. The bottom line is that you need to place the TV at a height that puts your eyes within the vertical line of sight of the actual screen (which you would likely do anyhow) or the picture will get dimmer.What I like the most about this TV is - NO GLARE! None!! Our previous TV was an annoyance in the daytime because of the door, windows and the lamp in the room. You saw everything in the screen, with the Samsung you see NOTHING! except the picture you are supposed to see. Even in the brightest part of the day it is perfect! I was prepared to accept some glare problems because of where this TV is located, but to my amazement there aren't any! NONE!It is light. When my wife and I bent down to pick it up to put it on the stand, I had myself prepared for a backbreaking load...I nearly sent it through the ceiling. In fact, it is so light, yet big, that if it will be located on a stand where a big dog or children can bump into it, you might want to take precautions.The remote is nice as well. There are easy remote presets for picture type and picture size that are really convenient. You do not have to go into complicated menus to make adjustments, just push a button (actually the menus are pretty simple as well).User friendly. I was dreading the endless adjustments and tweeks that must invariably be done...wrong again. Not necessary. Plug it in and turn it on. Seriously. You can make adjustments if you want to, but it is all easy and straight-forward.The Wii looks absolutely incredible on this TV. The Samsung really shows its stuff when the source (the media or the signal) match the capabilities of the TV.

I can accept that a single model of any product might fail for any reason at any time, but this is a well documented design defect and this company has clearly taken a position of stonewalling their affected customers.  I've made my living working with computers and AV equipment for over 25 years; dealing with problem equipment is not a new experience for me.  This encounter has revealed much more about Samsung than just the problem with my particular television set.

The TV works great - when it's working! I have no complaints regarding the picture, sound, or features, I love them. My complaint is with the quality of the parts and Samsung customer service. The first lamp that came with the TV lasted 18 months with average daily use. I had purchased a 3 year extended plan from Samsung but couldn't place a warranty service call on the website because it had no record of the extended warranty and the manufacturer warranty had expired. I had to call them and give them my contract number and then had to wait while they looked through several areas before finally finding it. Was told they would fix the info on the web. The lamp was replaced and guess what 7 months later it went out again. I did the math and the lamp that came with the TV was probably rated at 2000 hours but the lamp they replaced under warranty was probably some cheap OEM bulb rated at 1000 hours. To make matters worse I still couldn't place a service call on the website because it still did not show the extended warranty. I had to call again and do it all over. Was told the service center would contact me in 2 business days. They did not. I had to call them and then when they looked it up they said the information showed my TV was no longer under warranty so they couldn't schedule a warranty repair. Call Samsung again and they called the service center and squared it away. I asked about the website and they told me to try and re-register my product and it might let me add the extended warranty info. I tried and it said the product was already registered. I've been told there is no way to fix the erroneous info on the website -give me a break. I also asked if they would cover another lamp replacement and they gave me a number to call to ask for the details on my warranty. I called and got a message that the number was no longer in use. Called warranty repair number again and was given another number which I called and was told that the extended warranty only covered 1 lamp replacement and even though the bulb they replaced only lasted 7 months they would not cover another replacement. Beware, when you purchase an extended warranty Samsung will not replace your parts with comparable brand name parts they will use cheap substandard parts. Their customer service is pathetic. I will never, I repeat never buy Samsung again.", "Date": "March 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Hunk of Junk", "Author": "W.

After a year it started turning on and off automatically.  It took 3 weeks to get a Samsung authorized tech out to my house who couldn't fix it.  Dispatched another technician from another company 2 weeks later after calling Samsung and that tech found the problem but had to order a part.  A week later they were back to fix it.  Worked for 6 months and same problem happened again but now it was out of warranty.  After talking to Samsung support again, they agreed to cover the part and I had to pay for the service.  Techs came out 2 week later but Samsung sent them the wrong part.  Back again a few days later supposedly with the right part.  Thought they fixed it and payed them $150 then a week later, same problem again and now the HDMI 1 port is out.  I bought a Samsung 52\" LCD for my basement and it seems to be a much better quality than the DLP.  My Samsung Blu-Ray worked for 2 weeks and has been to repair twice now.  My Sony Blu-Ray works like a champ.  I'm now going to sell my DLP on Craigslist and go by a Sony.  I will never buy another Samsung product.  Samsung quality is not close to Sony's and Samsung support when you call them isn't bad but thier Outsourced TV repair companies and Outsourced Repair operations for mail-in repairs are also terrible.  I wish I wouldn't have bought my Samsung LCD Touch of Color at this point even though it is working fine.  I'm paranoid it will stop working in a year or two.  I can't say enough good things after buying that TV on Amazon though.
