{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice Video, OK Audio, But it Crashes", "Author": "huntandpeck", "ReviewID": "R3IQP67EVLZSAB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Wanted a bedroom TV that had full 1080p, network interface and Yahoo! Widgets (or similar capabilities).  Most other TV manufacturers offer this combination of features only in models of 40 inches or larger -- I wanted a smaller size for a simple bedroom TV.First, the good things...  Very nice picture that remains clear and viewable even from way off angle -- this is its strongest feature.  Also, the built-in Yahoo! Widgets include being able to view movies or listen to music ordered from services such as Netflix and Pandora without an outboard box.  Further, one of the Widgets brings in TV Guide over the Internet, which is helpful if your cable company can't seem to successfully transmit a TV Guide (or similar function) over their own cable.  I also found the remote control to actually be pretty good in the sense that the different buttons are of different shapes and sizes that you can actually find the correct buttons to push by touch without looking at them.Second, the OK thing...  I have to echo, to some extent, some of the other reviews that criticize the audio -- it's not really that bad, but I've had other LCD TVs of similar size that did better.  I must say, though, that the audio is clear, so you won't find yourself unable to understand what someone is saying when they're speaking softly, and the speakers output a full enough range that you won't find yourself wondering where an instrument disappeared to when listening to a piece of music.  I have encountered other small TVs (both old CRT types and current-day LCD types) that have had audio far, far worse than this -- some were so bad that the whole casing of the TV would vibrate when certain instruments were played in a piece of music -- this TV definitely does not have anything like that problem.Third, the problem...  It actually crashes!  This has to be the weirdest thing I've ever experienced or have ever said about a TV, but this thing actually crashes to the extent that it completely ignores the remote and its built-in button controls, and can only be brought back under control by unplugging it!  I'm guessing, but I think it's a simple case of overheating, because the crashes occur after it's been on for a number of hours to the point where the back side feels awfully hot.  The heat is a little surprising, since this is an edge-lit LED TV, and not one that uses CCFL backlighting.  Also, it doesn't seem to matter whether you use any of the Widget applications, or not -- the crashing occurs even when you do nothing more than feed it video from a cable box or other source.  So, the crashing doesn't seem to be precipitated by running any particular Widget application.Fourth, some missing information...  It is not made clear on Vizio's website or even if you download a PDF of the user's manual, but this TV comes with an external brick-type power supply.  This item caught me by surprise as most LCD TVs of this size (in my experience) have the power supply built in.  This is not a big deal, unless you intend to wall-mount it, in which case, you'll need to decide what to do with the brick power supply.All-in-all, I would be perfectly happy with this TV if I didn't occasionally need to unplug it in order to bring it back from crashing.  It's this weird crashing behavior that is actually causing me to consider returning it.", "Date": "November 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wonderful TV but sound could be better", "Author": "UGrev", "ReviewID": "R3928FSIHZMTRF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me preface my review with the following. I'm not an audiophile and this purchase was made for a bedroom TV.The picture quality is fantastic; and by fantastic, I mean better than my 42in Samsung Plasma.  The sound is less \"tinny\" than the previous model, but it still lacks in the bass which gives it that Laptop Speaker sound quality; though at a moderate volume, the quality appears to sound better (at least to me); Otherwise, for a bedroom TV, it's superb.WiFi is easy to set up (built in, and supported 128bit encryption). I found the settings/menu system to be extremely well done and easy to use with their remote control.Tried netflix and with only 2 bars for WiFi (due to distance from router), the picture quality was awesome and never \"readjusted\" due to signal degradation.The controls are located on the back of the TV, which makes it little cumbersome for the fly by power on, but I like it because my 3 year old likes to push buttons. Besides...we have remotes, right?The remote is a little cheap, but easy to use.Vizio apps load fast on my network (ymmv).-.5 for not so good bass (or lack there of at low vol)-.5 for lack of more possible sound options in the menu.You're definitely paying for picture, built in wifi & internet apps over sound quality with this purchase, so if you if you go into this purchase knowing this (as I did), then you should be happy and you could always hook up some external speakers to boost the sound quality.", "Date": "October 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV!", "Author": "Jon", "ReviewID": "REDE2OKDOSNVH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this to replace the 19\" LCD that was in our kitchen and we absolutely love it.  It was easy to connect to the internet (although I am good with computers and electronics).  The picture we get when streaming netflix is awesome.  Everyone that has been over comments on how thin the TV is and what a great picture it has.Other reviewers have commented on poor audio quality, I don't agree with them.  I guess there is room for improvement as far as the speakers go, but do you people really expect home theater sound out of a $400 high def razor thin TV?  Also the TV is in my kitchen where there is usually so much background noise and other stuff going on that the quality of the sound isn't really an issue. Lastly no one who has come over has ever made a comment on the sound quality and these are friends, not visitors who are trying to be polite.The internet apps all work great and entertain the kids for hours (I just need to figure out how to block the less appropriate content and it would be perfect).  I would buy this TV again in a heartbeat.Edit on 12/18/2010: We have used this TV everyday for the past two months and we still love it.  Pandora is great for Christmas music while we decorate and wrap presents. The internet apps work great and still no comments (good ones or bad ones) on the sound quality. We are still very happy with our purchase and I would definitely buy this TV again.", "Date": "November 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing Picture, External Speakers w/ Optical connection a MUST", "Author": "arizonastate", "ReviewID": "R1DP0MQU7EFECX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the VIZIO M261VP for the bedroom.  The following key specs attracted me to this TV:  LED backlight HDTV, 1080p resolution, built-in WiFi with 802.11n, and Netflix streaming. I had read the dozen or so reviews on this TV before my purchase knowing the picture quality would be excellent but the audio would be sub par.  I knew that I would need to hook up external stereo speakers based on all the negative audio reviews.I made the purchase in mid December after this TV went on sale at Sam's Club for $289.  The price on this TV will regularly go on sale at Office Max or Sam's Club for less than $300.00.  Even if you need to drop $40.00 on a Sam's Club membership, which I did, it is still a bargain.I have been using this TV for a week now.  The picture quality is EXCELLENT and I am very satisfied.  However, the audio quality is as bad as every negative review out there.  It is well known the smaller flat panel HDTV's on the market today have poor sound quality.  But, the VIZIO M261VP takes it to a new low.  The sound quality is hysterically horrible.  I found there were no audio setting adjustments to the SRS TruSurround and/or SRS TruVolume that improved the sound quality.  Do not buy this TV without knowing, which I did, you will need external speakers (even if it is for use in a bedroom or kitchen).There are only two ways to connect external speakers on this TV: through the headphone jack or through the digital optical connection.  Unfortunately, standard RCA audio output jacks are not included on this TV which is what most stereo and home theatre systems use.  To improve the sound quality, I first hooked up an old pair of Altec computer speakers and subwoofer using the headphone jack connection on the TV.  The computer speakers actually produced very good stereo sound quality that would be acceptable for regular TV viewing for most people.  But, if you plan to stream movies from the internet, it is important to know the sound will not come through the headphone jack to your external speakers.  The audio output signal from streaming is a digital signal and this signal cannot be transferred through the analog headphone jack.  No sound will come out to the external speakers.  The TV speakers of course will work, but the sound quality will be very poor on this TV.Instead of using the headphone jack connection, I recommend hooking up external speakers - a soundbar, or a home theatre system that have an optical digital connection.  I ditched the Altec computer speakers and purchased the ZVOX 550HSD sound bar system (28\" width) from ZVOX Audio.  It uses an optical digital TOSLINK cable to connect the soundbar to the TV.  The sound quality is amazing...Wow!  I now have incredible sound to match the awesome picture.  The Netflix and Amazon Movie streaming quality and experience on this TV have been excellent!!Bottom Line:  I recommend the VIZIO M261VP 1080p HDTV due to its price, features, and amazing picture quality.  However, due to the very poor audio quality, external speakers of some kind (soundbar, home theatre system) with an optical digital connection is a MUST.", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "One of the best tech items I own!!

I'm so glad that I did!  I love it - the design, the quality, and the incredible-ness of having sooo many software apps built in to the TV and working flawlessly over a wireless connection!  Netflix has some great features like a search function and a web-like preview while seeking that make it identical to a PC experience.  See the video review for more details and visuals of the interface - highly recommended.Edit 5/31/11: About a month has passed and I still love this TV.  I've shown it to friends and family who are amazed at how simple the interface is and how everything is built-in.  New widgets get released regularly, Vimeo is one of the latest.  I've had the TV crash just once (pressing a bunch of buttons when it was unresponsive, and it rebooted), recovered fine.  Very happy.Update 7/14/11: Still very happy with this TV.  Despite the other review on crashing, mine has only crashed twice since I've owned it (buttons become unresponsive, TV shuts down), and does not need to be unplugged but turns back on just fine from the remote power button.  Maybe newer firmware has corrected the earlier issues.  New discovery though: this TV does *not* support 5 GHz 802.11n.  It only supports 2.4 GHz.  What does this mean?  It can't take advantage of the higher speed, less congested (5 GHz) networks on newer routers.  This is unfortunate (and not clear at all in Vizio's specs), but on my network, even 1080p movies from Vudu (HDX) are currently working fine on 2.4 GHz.Update 5/5/12: This is my bedroom TV and it's still working great. Youtube has been added, which is the one thing the TV was lacking before. This model isn't that popular anymore, but newer models will have similar firmware to what's the video here.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV for the $", "Author": "Ed Sku \"Edge3333\"", "ReviewID": "RNU8MZHHC98ZF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Picture quality is excellent.

If you're not happy with the sound, and you don't adjust it much, you can remedy the problem with some computer speakers plugged into the headphone jack. Connection to my network went flawlessly. The widgets that I've tried work well (Netflix streaming, FaceBook and a couple of others) as Yahoo! adds more, they are displayed on the app screen as new and you have the option of adding them or not. The various picture modes are explained well, unlike some other TVs manuals. Actually, the whole manual is well written and informative, with the exception of where the power line plugs into the set. The LED back lighting is adjustable.A couple of things could be an issue for some. As mentioned, the 'brick' power supply, along with the side mounted cables.

The TV is great but my only complaint is the remote (remote model # VR17). Since VIZIO calls this an Internet TV, there is NO keyboard that slides as advertised. It even mentions in the manual that you can slide open for the keyboard. After nearly 3 frustrating hours, reseaching just to open the keyboard, I finally called Tech Support today. At first the lady said all Vizio Internet Apps (VIA) TV comes with the keyboard option. But after doing some research herself, she said that VR17 does not have that option - A BIG DISSAPONITMENT !!!.She said I could purchase VUR10 remote and that would cost me another $60. She suggested that I can buy a keyboard (yes, computer keyboard) instead.

Vizio has already added more since I bought it last 2 months ago. I wanted a TV that I could use without having to bother my TV provider to get an additional setup for it and in turn pay for service to another TV. So with an antenna and internet connectivity, this gets the job done.The bad is that some of the apps do not always work well or at all and the sound. Netflix has always worked great for me, same is the case with Amazon Video. Those are the ones I want to work the most. So, no real complaints there. I wish it had Youtube, but oh well.As for the sound, I knew of the complaints that many spoke of. But, I figured I could just hook up my computer speakers with its sub and I'm good. But, that's not the case. This TV's external sound system really only works good through the digital toslink output. With analog, you can only attach via the headphone jack. Yes, it is an improvement, but, it would not push the subwoofer. Additionally, some apps sounded even worse. Others, sounded ok, Like Hulu and Amazon. Netflix was iffy. If you want to use the music apps, like Tunein radio, Rhapsody or Pandora, forget it. I hated that I could not utilize the power of the sub, knowing that I had premium computer speakers. That really irritated me because I wasn't planning on buying a sound system for this TV. Almost any optical input speaker system is fairly expensive. I almost switched this for a smaller Sony Bravia with Internet video. I knew the sound would be good on it and that I could fully utilize my computer speakers if I wanted more sound. But, I ended up finding a used Vizio sound bar in great condition for really cheap on Craigslist. So, I am keeping it for now. It's kind of a shame that external system is almost essential for any smaller Vizios. But, now I can truly amplify the sound like I want to. It works well for all the apps as well.I would only recommend this TV if you were planning on connecting to a sound system that has an optical input.", "Date": "February 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "A possible M261VP audio (bass problem) fix", "Author": "DerkMan", "ReviewID": "R3I3MQ1MQB6EBJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I think i was able to fix that horrible audio problem that causes a lack of bass on the m261vp.

It is such a thin light monitor why would someone expect it to sound like a theater.  That said about the bass - the sound is good.  Can I tell the difference in sound when I am in my living room and then go to my bedroom to watch this?  Yes.  But the sound is still fine.  It seems silly that so many people have complained about it.2. The power cable.  I am not sure how you would hang this TV on a wall.  The power cable has a brick attached to it.  To save room on the TV and I assume make it less heavy and hot they put the power converter separate from the TV.  About halfway down the power cable is a box about half the size of a brick.

It is easy on the eyes in any light condition. Some TV's are hard on my eyes in low light. 3D movies are murder on my eyes in the theater. This TV doesn't hurt my eyes. The reason why I bought a HDTV with an LED backlight is, not for the energy savings or the size, but because LED backlights are easier on the eyes than traditional florescent backlights. The blacks of the TV are black. I consider the picture quality to be the most important part of the HDTV and this does not disappoint. The TV scales SD images well. Even watching SD movies in Netflix look good.The Vizio internet apps is an excellent bonus. It has the essential Netflix, which works well. I haven't yet tried to get a HD movie through my Wi-Fi with Netflix. I may end up running an ethernet cable to it instead of using Wi-Fi. I quickly found an app from my local TV station which I installed. Now I can get the radar on my TV anytime! There are plenty of apps to download, including many useless ones you just know Vizio was paid to install by default. Unfortunately you cannot (yet) get a Youtube app.Now some bad. The audio is just terrible. No bass, very high pitched. I plan on using some small external speakers to deal with the bad sound. This is an annoyance but not a turn-off. This problem can easily be addressed.If you want to do some channel surfing with your cable or over the air TV you better be prepared to spend some time doing so. It takes about 1.5 seconds for the TV to change channels, even the old analog channels. This problem can also be fixed with a DVR, satellite or cable box, or media center PC.As far as the extras: Switching between apps is slow because Vizio thought the effect of scrolling to the next app was better than my time. Not too big of a deal since I won't be using many apps to begin with. The Wi-Fi antenna is a little weak. It only gets a medium strength signal even though my router is about 20 feet away. When the TV was first set up, it asked for my name, phone number, and email. I didn't provide my phone or email, that is none of Vizio's business.Overall I am very happy with this TV.

The set is very slim which probably explains why the power supply is external like a laptop (quark #1). I purchased this set to replace a 26\" samsung (T260HD) and will say that picture quality is comparable but the Vizio has a much better vertical viewing angle; a potentially important attribute if this is destined for the bedroom. Many have complained about the sound quality and while I agree that it isn't great, I'd say it's typical for TVs in this size range. It is however irritating because if you are intending to watch movies and listen to music, you are literally missing a good chunk of frequencies on both ends of the spectrum and the result is a very dull, midrange emphasized sound...sort of like a record player (quark #2). I wasn't too concerned because I figured I could simply hook up some computer speakers via the headphone jack. HOWEVER, be forewarned that this audio output will sound as terrible as the TVs speakers, regardless of what speaker system you connect it to. I suspect the reason is because whatever capacitor/crossover network that regulates the frequencies going to the TVs speakers is also limiting the frequencies that go to the headphone audio output. The only solution is to use the optical audio output which unfortunately is far less common an input on any computer/compact speaker system. This is the only real issue I have with this set.As far as the internet capability goes, everything works pretty well. Occasionally, the scrolling will \"twitch\" like a smartphone (quark #3) but so far all the apps I've tested (Netflix, Yahoo, Pandora, Facebook, Hulu) all work without delay.

It's an older model and we offer many other models of that size that will likely meet your needs better.Gil: Not all of our smaller tv's have the best speakers in them, this was one that had lower end speakers put in to keep the price point down for those who wanted it Gil: We offer other models though that have better speakers.M Barrett:Thank you, Gil.  Based on these responses and Vizio's dismal record and failure to make good what is soooo bad I don't think I can consider ever buying another product from Vizio.

Thank you for your time.Follow-up Aug 24thI bought the 26' Vizio m261vd and the sound was awful - almost brought it back for refund but gave it another chance and paid $100 for the sound bar. didn't work. bought optical cable. worked. could not program the TV remote that was described in the description by Walmart and Vizio as being a universal remote. It is not. Boxed up the stuff I purchased when I could get nowhere with tech support. made last ditch effort with tech support and next day during my lunchbreak found a Sony Google TV that is bigger and cheaper than all I have spent so far. Got back from lunch and I had an email that stated Vizio was sending me this remote. This is a \"should I stay or should I go\" type of moment. I do appreciate the fact that Vizio is stepping up to the plate on this. Even if it is because not to do so would mean they were in violation of federal DTPA laws. I appreciate it.

Great so far (about 3 weeks), in terms of picture quality and apps.  Picture mode is set to \"movie\" which has the most accurate colors, with slight tweaking.  I can't imagine using the other picture modes as the colors are way off even with adjustments.  Stick with movie, not as good as my plasma, but good.  Lots of available apps.  I mainly use Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Pandora.  Wifi connectivity is great - connected right away and has stayed connected.  Streaming has been excellent.Now for the 2 major negatives.  Channel changing takes f-o-r-e-v-e-r.  A workaround: try hitting the \"OK\" button on the remote.  This pulls up a menu of all the channels.  You can easily scroll to select the channel you want.  Much, much faster than using the channel buttons.  And now for the notorious audio.  I initially hooked up my computer speakers through the headphone jack on the TV.  A very, very slight improvement, but absolutely no bass, except during that very brief moment between changing channels that others mentioned.  Someone in another review said that the only way to improve sound is to use the digital optical/toslink out and this is absolutely correct.  There are few options available for speakers/soundbars with optical input.  It seems that only the pricey, high-end soundbars are rated well, so I looked instead for a 2.1 system.  Based on price and sound quality, here is the best option I could find: Edifier S330D.  These speakers make a HUGE difference.  I can actually stream Pandora now without cringing.  BTW, someone in another review mentioned a speaker system that cost around $400 which to me is totally unrealistic for a bedroom TV.  BUT, at least that person offered a suggestion.

Also, the remote must be aimed in a narrow range vertically in order to work.I ended up buying a pair of AudioEngine A2 speakers to supplement the sound. Although these are great speakers, it's not an optimal solution. When using the TV headphone jack to connect with the speakers, the sound quality is improved, but shallow on the bass. I called Vizio customer support and found that the headphone and optical out outputs come from different sections of the sound circuitry. So I took a chance and got much better sound by utilizing the TV \"Optical Out\" to connect the speakers but then the volume controls of the remote cannot be used. In order to convert the Toslink, Optical Out cable to the speakers I bought a Optical Digital converter.

However, I'm coming from a 10 year old 21\" Toshiba that I could connect a single composite video output to my projector and watch TV on the living room wall, which was great for sports and movies. This Vizio has no such output nor any video outputs. There is only 1 audio output to connect to a stereo system, but it is optical audio, which may require a conversion kit to use with my existing stereo. The USB input didn't work (which was frustrating as I had just looked at pictures from my USB memory stick on a friend's new 21\" Samsung the night before). After digging into the manual, it states that the USB is for Vizio Technicians only. Thanks but no thanks for advertising the USB input, Vizio!Finally, I expected to entertain friends with YouTube videos through the Vizio Internet Apps. Unfortunately, the TV comes with pre-loaded apps much like a smart phone and I was unable to get YouTube videos on the TV. Vizio directed me to a website called Flingo which is supposed to let you send videos to the TV from your computer via a WiFi connection, but after trying for two days to get it to work with YouTube, I gave up. The Vizio Webvideo app on the TV does have many great videos, but also some raunchy ones, which was a bit disappointing. The sports apps are laughable - not even worth the time. Facebook is definitely a scaled down version. There is a nice music app, however, which allows you to get radio stations from all over the world. Since I'm comparing it to my old Toshiba, I'll probably keep it; but I did expect more from a new model TV", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV, Netflix streaming flawless, Super Clear", "Author": "R.

At that price I was skeptical of quality, but after 2 months of use, it has performed great.Fine tuning your picture:  You have to do some fine tuning on your picture.  The first thing I noticed was that this tv didn't seem very bright.  We turned off the background control and the picture became vibrant and crystal clear immediately.  I highly suggest spending a good hour tweaking this unit... and you need to fine tune it for every input.  I am using 2 HDMI's and the Components and had to fine tune each of them separately.Second, this tv is very thin, so don't expect the sound quality of a large box tv.  There is no room in this tv for speakers to create a nice full sound.  You won't find a tv this thin that will.  If you aren't familiar with sound, speakers require a lot of space to produce sound.  The older box tvs didn't produce fantastic sound either, but they do sound better than these thin flat panels.  If you want to improve your sound quality, you will have to connect to a stereo... or you can go a much less expensive route and purchase computer speakers and plug them in.  I'd suggest those with 2 satellite speakers and a amplified woofer box.  You can find these starting at $25 on up to several hundred.  You get what you pay for, so don't expect the world for under $50 because it isn't there, but you will get a big improvement.  Just make sure you find a speaker system that is shielded otherwise you may have issues with background noise (this is the speaker, not the tv).Third, the apps on this TV are great.  I have watched several Netflix movies streamed through the apps on this tv.  Flawless, crystal clear picture.  TV was very simple to set up the wireless connection.  If you find streaming slow, it is likely your internet speed, not the tv.Fourth, clarity is superb when connected to HD cable or DVDs/Blue Ray.  If you connect it to standard definition, you'll likely be disappointed because standard def channels are all over the place.  Some channels use standard tv dimensions, others use widescreen settings, etc.  HDTVs have trouble with lower resolution.  Lettering can look fuzzy.  This is an issue with all HDTVs.Finally, we purchased this for our bedroom to replace our old 27\" big box tv. It was the best choice.

She told me it could be the remote (The odds of the other two being bad are ???). She told me there was nothing they would do as the TV was out of warranty. Yes, it was out by less than three months and had only been used a handful of times!It appears to me Vizio builds a product designed to last no longer than it's warranty. I have heard they build a special version (cheaper) just for Wal-Mart where I bought mine. Yes, I saved $20 bucks buying a Vizio but bought an inferior product.

Picture is fine as a TV, but it's rated for up to 1920x1024 resolution for PC use. This is too high of a resolution for this screen size. everything is way too small. Normally the solution to this would be to downsize the resolution to the next level. But on this TV the two next lower, most common, industry standard resolutions are missing (1366x768, 1280x768). The next available resolution is 1024x768 which throws the TV into an old SD format narrow box and makes half the screen unusable.None of this is on the box. The box doesn't even mention a remote control.At 1920x1024 the screen needs A LOT of adjustment to get it readable without a lot of aliasing. Eventually had to up the font size to 120DPI thru the windows control panel to get it readable.Also the WiFi on this set doesn't appear to have a deactivate option. Not using it, but I wouldn't want the WiFi trying to connect to the neighbors all day.Some reviews have mentioned a firmware update that fixes the sound. Mine came with C1.2.24_rc0. I didn't try sound, but there was no option anywhere to do firmware update checks. After about 24 hours, it did a background firmware update that added some features such as HDMI CEC and Ambient Light Sensing, but no useful screen resolutions. Firmware updated to C3.2.33_RC3This may be a good TV, but it is not a good computer monitor. Without the standard screen sizes, it has to be returned in favor of a another brand.Prior to this I had a Hitachi L32BD304 32in TV which was able to handle the larger screen format and was all around better out of the box.Next up will be the S27B350H monitor from Samsung which supports a variety of screen resolutions.TV makers should design computer monitors and then add tuners instead of designing TVs and then adding computer support.Ideally, I'd like to see 30-32in computer monitors with 1920x1080 or higher resolution, HDMI, OTA tuner and PIP support.

I wound up receiving one as a gift.I couldn't be more pleased! The picture is great, and the Internet apps work very well. Vudu works great, Facebook, Twitter, and just about any other Yahoo widget is at your fingertips.  Netflix works very well also.The styling is nice, and it is extermely thin and light. The included stand does the job just fine, and matches the rest of the TV.The remote control isn't all that hot. It's bulky/boxy, and feels like I'm using a remote control from the 50s/60s when I push the buttons. It works fine, but just feels \"wrong\". Luckly I had an old Logitech Harmony I set up to work perfectly with it.My only complaint is, you guessed it, the sound!! It's terrible! Transistor radio or really cheap radio sound actually may have a leg up on this! VERY tinny with no dynamic sound whatsoever. I went out and bought a $15 pair of computer speakers to hook up to the headphone jack. They're not fantastic either, but a marked improvement over the built-in speakers! If Vizio did one thing to this TV it should be to improve the audio!! if you're going to connect it to a home theater setup or sound bar via the digital optical out, then no worries. Otherwise, you might want to pick up a pair of computer speakers.The video is crisp and sharp in HD, and even the SD looks pretty good (certainly beats my old 19\" tube!). It does change channels a little slow, but there's a pop-up channel list that's decent to use for quickly popping around.To sum it up, if sound isn't an issue for you, buy this TV!! 26\" is perfect for a bedroom for run-of-the-mill TV fun.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Picture !!

The center and front speakers are small and crisp and fit right in front of the TV.  The subwoofer is more than adequate for this size TV.

I'm very happy with the TV.  Setup was fast simple.  It connected easily to my home wireless network.  The picture is very nice with HD content.  I stream Netflix to the TV often over the wireless and it works great.The TV has major audio flaws which may or may not affect you.The built in speakers don't get very loud and the sound is pretty average.  This is not uncommon for a smaller TV and not a big problem for most people.  But the MAJOR AUDIO FLAW is that all the bass is filtered out of the headphone output jack on the back.  I searched the web and this is a common complaint for this TV.  If you don't use the headphone output, then this problem won't impact you.  For me it was a major pain.  I'll explain...I installed the TV in my basement \"home gym\".  So, I could stream NetFlix wirelessly while running on my treadmill.  I didn't expect the built in speakers to be loud enough to be heard over the sound of the treadmill and my panting/wheezing.  So, I had planned to use an old PC speaker system with subwoofer.  These speakers plug into the headphone jack.  This is when I found the problem.  Watching TV with only the higher pitched sounds was not enjoyable.  The only work around I could find was to use the TVs optical audio out.  To do this you either need to use a stereo with optical input or an optical to analog converter.  I did the latter...I purchased a \"FiiO D3 Digital to Analog Audio Converter\" from amazon (~$25) and RCA-to-headphone audio cable (~$5).  The converter allowed me to plug in my old PC speaker system.  The sound is now fantastic!  But.....the volume of the optical output on the TV is NOT controlled by volume by the TV remote control.  This is not really that unusual after I thought about it.  If you were plugging optical directly into a stereo this wouldn't be a problem.  But for me using my PC speakers it was.  So, now I need to buy a remote volume control to put inline with the FiiO device.  There is a \"Koss VC20 Volume Control\" available on amazon for $7 that should work.  This will work for me because my TV is right next to my treadmill.  If your TV was across the room you'd need a different solution.  It's a bit of a pain to have to keep working around the Visio headphone output flaw.I'd recommend the FiiO Digital to Analog converter in general and for use with the TV.  The sound is really good.Again, overall GREAT TV with average or below average sound from the build in speakers.  But with the only functioning audio out being the optical out, it may not work with your planned setup without some add-ons to work around the audio flaws.", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "sound is terrible", "Author": "ej", "ReviewID": "R38XJ8OMY9FPFT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The picture is great but the sound is just awful!

The TV is worth getting for that app alone for me.  One tv, one plug in the wall, one app and nothing else hanging on the wall or below but this thin tv with a lovely picture for the price.  A thing of beauty.  NetFlix has worked flawlessly for me.  One thing to note, I had it up and running via wifi in about 25 minutes out of the box and it was not so great.  Then within two hours the tv pushed an update and it has been perfect since that happened.  My router is more than 50 yards away from my bedroom and in a garage outside with several walls and my kitchen in the middle and I still get excellent signal.  Better signal that my iPad gets actually.  Unfortunately, wireless hardware is not a perfect thing and some people's mileage may vary.

I have far from \"ideal wifi conditions\" in my home and I am still pleased.  Perhaps I am lucky.The remote is just okay.  It stinks at first during setup when you are getting all the apps and passwords going but once the tv is setup the remote is fine for general use.  I agree, it would be nice to have the slider keyboard attached but again, this tv is designed for occasional use at a price point almost anyone can handle.

This is a quote from my post on the Vizio website reviewing this model:  This model M261VP of Vizio has superb picture quality and superb angle viewing quality!  But there is a serious software bug regarding the Audio.  No Bass, and EQ or Basic Bass settings do not work at all.  Sounds like a sardine can.  Unbelievably awful audio!  Plug in headphones or connect powered speakers and same result!  Tin can sound!  Vizio should do a firmware fix for this but apparently they don't care or don't care to know of this widespread problem with this model.  SO I FIGURED OUT THE FIX FOR THIS PROBLEM!!!  Simply do this:  Go to Advanced Audio.  Turn off SRS TruSurround if it is on and keep it off!  Scroll down 2 steps to Digital Audio Out.  If it is set to PCM then switch to Dolby Digital.  If it is set to Dolby Digital then switch to PCM.  If it is set to OFF then switch to either PCM or Dolby Digital and then back to either Dolby Digital or PCM.  It does not matter which one because the act of switching will restore all BASS sound and the EQ settings will now work completely.  Now go to Equalizer settings and set both the 100mhz and 300mhz sliders all the way up.  The middle (1000mhz) at -4 and the last 2 at middle or a little above middle.  It now has awesome sound compared to before!  Do this while using quality headphones or earbuds to really blow your head off with the difference.  If you switch back to SRS TruSurround you will lose all Bass and back to tin can sound.  Follow my instructions above to restore Bass and great sound!  Leave SRS TruSurround off and the sound will remain good with EQ and Bass settings functional.  You will notice it still has a decent surround effect.

In my instance, a bug was able to fly into the panel below the screen and is stuck there.  I didn't even know that was possible.  I'd assume a well manufactured unit would be not have gaps that allow bugs or any particles to come into the screen.  Vizio didn't seem to care when I asked if this meant dust could get in and start a fire.  They also didn't care when I asked if I needed to worry about children getting their fingers caught in the casing and electrocuting themselves.If you don't mind buying something that's going to let you down, sold by people who don't care about their product's quality and don't stand buy it, this is the perfect !", "Date": "September 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "big promise, fail to delivery", "Author": "adi", "ReviewID": "R2JU3YMGD47ZF8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have purchased the TV and within promised time got the delivery.
