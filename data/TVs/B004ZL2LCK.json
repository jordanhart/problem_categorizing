Welch", "ReviewID": "R1MLZ8XOHCIF5S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i purchased this 42\" vizio tv a couple of weeks ago and so far i am very happy. it has great color i love the internet apps, the high def looks great and even the 3d is stunning. after much research, i found the amazon price very reasonable compared to other vendors, especially considering the fact that i did not have to pay any sales tax and shipping and handling were free. setup was basically easy (i am not real technically inclined) and we had the tv up and running within 20 or so minutes.i have a few minor complaints but still feel this tv warrants five stars. they are:1. the sound is not the richest, but most flat screens will have sound which is inferior to a home theater system. thus, i purchased a sony home theatre for my visio and am very happy. cost of the home theater from amazon; $257.2. the tv takes a little while to come on. i don't know if that is particular to this brand/model since this is the first flat screen i have owned.3. if you have little children, the tv base that comes with it is not real stable and the tv could possibly be tipped easily. of course if you are hanging it on a wall, this is not an issue. be sure to have your tv on a solid level stand so it will not tend to tip.other than that i am very pleased with the quality and price of my new tv. now i just hope i don't become a couch potato and gain 50 pounds with my new little toy.oh yes, one idea i've tried which i really like. i've been storing tons of digital photos on a couple of computers for years. they were really not organized much and i seldom viewed them. since the vizio will play photos or music from its usb ports, i purchased a 16 mb thumb drive and put literally thousands of photos on it, arranged in various folders. i plugged my thumb drive into the usb port on the side of my vizio, and now i can watch a slide show right in my living room any time i want.the only thing i was disappointed in is vizio will not play videos on removeable drives. but i purchased a western digital media player (a little black box with a remote; model # WDAVNOOBN) to plug into vizio's hdmi port. that will allow me to play my home videos from an external drive hooked to the media box. the western digital player only cost $39, well worth it.hope this review helped.dave", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great buy Great TV", "Author": "seveles", "ReviewID": "R3M5AJQVGSCRQ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent months looking for a TV and finally found this one.

The LED LCD screen at 42\" is big enough for all your needs, home theater, casual watching, video games.  its excellent, the TV is light and thin due to it being a flat screen and all :P.  easy to use menu and set up. the only downside is you cannot turn off the WiFi on it.  which tbh isnt really a down side.  ive owned it for 2 months now and love it, so my suggestion if you are looking for a TV this is the one", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent For The Price", "Author": "ethanmc12", "ReviewID": "RYES4N70KXTDU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first HDTV after looking and researching for months.

Did a lot of research and this looked like the best fit for us in terms of features, size and price. The picture is crisp and clear, and the colors and brilliant and vibrant. Setup was a snap. We were able to get rid of a switch box that we needed with our old analog set, and with the internet apps -- we no longer need our Roku (although we'd very much like to see Vizio extend its apps to some other services). The only disappointment was our old legacy VCR (as we've still got a few films which aren't available on DVD or streaming anywhere) which because the set has the 3 component video and not the one video RCA slot, just can't be hooked up directly. Overall, very pleased with our decision. Our living room gets a lot of light during the day, and the picture is just as great then as it is with the lights out. The low energy consumption was another plus for us, plus with the fact that we now have two fewer devices plugged in, this will additionally lower our power use. This set has brought new life to our viewing. We don't have a Blu-ray yet so all of these comments are based on viewing that isn't even at its highest resolution. People who've bought other sets have seen ours and have been impressed with the quality and said they'd look into a Vizio themselves in the future. All-in-all a terrific purchase that we have been enjoying tremendously.", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "The VIZIO M420SV TV, an acceptable TV.", "Author": "William Joel Hurless \"will1384\"", "ReviewID": "R2GGV2ANTC6XQC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros:(1) The LCD has good clarity, and detail.(2) The LCD also looks to have a good refresh rate.(3) The TV is very thin and light, the product page saysits 26.6lbs without the stand, and 29.5lbs with the stand.(4) The TV's OTA HDTV tuner is very sensitive.(5) This TV only uses around 66 watts.Cons:(1) On the product box and on VIZIO M420SV product page it says\"120Hz refresh rate\" however the M420SV will not take 120Hz input,they should tell you this.(2) The Internet Apps are not very good, a few things put me off fromusing them:HD video on the internet will not play correctly on a 1.5MB connectionwith this TV, and none of the Internet Apps on this TV will let you select alower quality version of the video to play.And there is no way to sort or show what videos are HD, howeverthe \"Amazon instant video\" App will show \"HD\" at the top of its HDvideo preview images, but lacks a way of sorting between HD and SD.Many of the Internet Apps do not seem to have been well thought out,are hard to use, or just not very good.In the \"Amazon instant video\" App, they have a \"Prime Instant Video\" button but allit shows are \"Top Movies\" and Top Shows\", no sorting and no searching forPrime Instant Videos.\"iHeartRadio\" works well, however the screen stays on when playingmusic, the App should turn the screen off, or have a screensaver.There is no Youtube App.\"Yahoo News App\" has no full screen function, no customization of news stories.(3) The default picture settings looked bad to me, I found some Calibrationsettings that helped a lot:(Backlight---50) (Brightness---50) (Contrast---71) (Color---46)(Tint---0) (Sharpness---0) (Smooth Motion Effect---Off) (Real Cinema Mode---Off)(Noise Reduction---Off) (MPEG NR---Off) (Color Enhancement---Off)(Adapative Luma---Off) (Film Mode---Auto) (Backlight Control---Off)(Ambient Light Sensor---Off)* The original calibration setting had (Backlight---100) but (Backlight---50) wasenough for me(4) Sound quality is fair, not great, but acceptable, I ended up adding an Altec LansingACS340 speaker system.(5) The remote is small, buttons can be hard to press, and I am worried aboutreplacement cost should it ever break.(6) There is no \"Automatic\" in the \"Screen Mode\" menu, the only thing I missfrom my old TV, without an automatic mode I seem to be switching the screenmode every other show.Conclusion:This is a nice TV, has a good LCD and good OTA HDTV tuner, howeverthe \"Internet Apps\", and the \"120Hz refresh rate\" on a TV that will not accept120Hz input, are useless gimmicks.", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Vizio LED 1080p 120Hz 42\" Internet TV", "Author": "MoeAy", "ReviewID": "R3GTFJQJA210Y5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After searching the market for a decent TV for a couple of months, I'm happy that finally decided to go with Vizio.

Easy set up!!!!  After moving to the city, I made up my mind to avoid the overpriced cable fees at all cost.  So, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu Plus are my main sources of entertainment.  To my surprise, my portable antenna also works.  I could get some local channels to watch news and some tv shows (Fox, ABS, NBC).  Also, watch some cable shows thru a HDMI cable connection from my laptop. More than enough.Vizio also have regular upgrades for their apps.  Not too often, but just enough (for now).  I loaded up Pandora and a few others to use along with Facebook.  Hope there are more to explore soon.Remote control looks great and handy.  Love it.One thing that I found slightly annoying is the audio setup (level of volume.  I saw other people also complained about it...as well as a few others who complained about the complainers. :  I tried to adjust the default setup different ways...only slightly improved.

Can't switch between theater/tv/sports/music/game mode easily.  - No YouTube app. And through tons of readings online it doesn't look like they are going to add one any time soon.  - The TV panel cannot be swiveled.

Loved it, so bought a 47 wifi when it became available.  The 32 i use in the bedroom with a vizio soundbar (its great once you fix the remote by cutting away some plastic around the remote receiver).  Then I bought this 42 for a good friend, she loves it.  I bought this one from Amazon and the others from Costco.  The 32 and 47 had one minor problem, the Vizio light on the front is toooooooooo bright.  The 42, however, has already got an adjustment to dim or turn off the light.  Wondering when they will update the firmware/software on my other sets.  My house already has 802.11n wifi, use it for iphones, the two sets, sony blurays, a laptop and hp touchscreen and directv which has the family share feature.  It would be nice if you could select update software as an option but all these sets appear to do that though I havent figured out exactly how I can track update history.Oh, this set arrived quickly. I ordered it on a Sunday or Saturday nite, cant remember, and it arrived at my friends place Monday afternoon. No lifting and shipping is free cuz I invested in the premium option. Dont know why I ever bought anywhere else.  I bought a vizio soundbar for my friend too because the sound isnt great on amy of these thin sets. Fit the soundbar upside down under the cabinet shelf so i switched left and right channels using rca plugs and made the requisite cutouts for the remote in the soundbar cover.  Highly recommend this set--Vizio is the hidden hi-tech leader, they dont promise features they just include them as features while other sets only include in high end systems.", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "very satisfied", "Author": "ST", "ReviewID": "R3PGLAX86RBB86", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Vizio allowed me to max out the available space in my entertainment center (with the pocket doors removed).

The image is great, the sound is very tiny but I was aware of this.  What I was not expecting was the remote. Ergonomically speaking is very poor. The kwerty keyboard in the back should have a cover.  I learn to use my remotes in the dark and this one is impossible to figure out which side goes on top and which end on front. To make matters worse the volume control for instance depends on an initial digital command to start the volume control. In other words if the remote is not properly pointed at the receiver you can hold the button for the remote in front of the TV and it will do nothing.  I also wish that the unadvertised PIP feature would be more helpful.  How difficult would it be to allow the picture to be swapped or at least the sound.  I know the sound is possible because my TIVO control which is not fully compatible can swap the sound of the PIP by pressing the input button.  Another function that I really would appreciate would be to be able to go to the default cable input when simply selecting up or down channel.  This feature is invaluable for someone who does not know how to operate the different inputs.  Just tell them to move the up and down channel and they have a TV no matter what input was previously set. Great for Grandpa's weekend stays!. The layout of the essential buttons; power, input up and down volume, channel last channel and mute are very logical. The intenet apps deliver as promised but again there are problems.  In order to get out from an app and into another you have to pull all the way out back into TV and then try to go back.  The lack of thought is even more evident because there are unused buttons in the remote which work specifically with the apps. Althoug the TV does not advertise composite video it is possible to plug the yellow RCA to green component video and it works just fine.  I did have to call tech support for this since it's not in the manual. There is an unassigned button below the #9 which could really have a function.

We have contacted VIZIO on two separate occasions and are still left without functionality of the apps.  NetFlix for example tells us we have no internet connection when indeed we do which has been confirmed by VIZIO customer service; they actually helped us set it up during our first call to them.  The VIZIO rep suggested contacting NetFlix, which we did and were told we needed to purchase a separate HD router, If we had know this prior to purchase it is likely we would have gone with a different manufacture.

Those that said it is difficult to set-up, do not realize that yes you will need your router passcode to set the tv up, that is with any product you are trying to connect to Wifi and no fault of VIZIO.  It took less than 5 minutes to hook the tv up to the wireless as I made sure to store my password in a place where I can find it. The picture is clear, particularly with HD.  The apps. are nice, I just wish there was a way to add in your own apps. or websites instead of being stuck with what is already there. The TV is light weight.  I have a SAMSUNG that I paid three times as much for, and this tv thus far rivals the Samsung.  The only concern I have, and will have to wait and see, is will it last as long?UPDATE:  TV was good for a couple of weeks, then I had to change routers.  Once changing the router all other wireless products I had took the new passcode and worked flawlessly.  This TV would not work on the wireless network anymore.  I called and spent hours on the phone with the company I bought the router from, and then with Vizio.  Vizio customer service could not fix the problem.  Finally the guy put me on hold then came back and said the following \"this is going to sound like I am trying to get you off the phone, but really I am not...\"  Then what he said made absolutely no sense and I told him it made no sense and that I had no confidence in what they were saying at all...so basically they couldn't fix it and he really did just want to get off the phone.
