{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It's a nice TV but 3D is not worth the premium you pay", "Author": "R. Schueler", "ReviewID": "R3K2C4PAT4PS34", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had my Sony KDL46NX810 for about a month.  I have the 3D accessories, a Sony PlayStation 3 and a computer hooked to the TV.  Most of the content I watch is on the internet over the computer, streaming Netflix, and Amazon Video on Demand.  The 3D effect is a novelty.  Once the new wears off I will put the 3D glasses in a draw and forget about them. I wish I purchased a less expensive TV that does not have 3D.  Other than my disappointment with 3D, I am quite happy with the TV.CONNECTIONS: My computer and PlayStation are both connected to the TV with 12' long inexpensive HDMI cables purchased from Harbor Freight (seller of cheap tools).  The 3D starter pack I purchased came with a \"High-speed HDMI cable..... (for the) transfer of both 3D video and audio signals\".  So far the inexpensive HDMI cable seems to work fine even with 3D content. The TV is also connected to the internet with a cat 5 cable.  It has WiFi but I didn't need it (or try it). I have high speed internet access through the local cable provider.  I have experienced no trouble streaming content.ANTENNA: I get the same number of channels over the air as I did when I had a 7 year old generic HD TV.  There is an onscreen program guide. During setup the TV asked if I wanted the programming guide from the internet or from over-the-air.  I chose the internet option.  On the TV guide channel I can see what will be on hours from now.LOOK: The TV looks great.  The Sony emblem lights up when you turn on the TV.  You can turn that feature off if you want. I have the TV mounted on the wall. The monolithic design was great.  I say was because the IR emitter that is required for 3D makes the TV not so monolithic any more.  The emitter is the bunny-ears of the 3D television age.  It should have been built in to the TV.  It's not that bad but it does not add to the look and Sony is selling the \"Monolithic Design\".ACCESSORIES : The remote control seems rather long and has many buttons.  When I first got the TV I tried to learn the remote and how to get from thing to thing.  After a day or two I navigated the options of the TV through the Home Menu.  The Home Menu is easy to navigate and is very similar to the PS3 menu organization.  Everything is easy to find and the TV is easy to navigate.  The stations that I get over the aerial all have their own icon in the menu.  There is also a description of what is on now.  Everything the TV can do is available through the graphical menu.The remote control also will navigate the PS3 menus and control video play back on the PS3.  Play, Stop, Fast Forward, and Next all work as expected from the TV remote controlling the PS3.  The cross button in the center of the remote is the same as the x button on the PS3 controller.  The back button will move you back towards the main menu.  I am very happy with the way the TV remote controls the PS3.  I tried to use the TV remote as a controller for a game but there is no Start button so I could not start the game.  There would be no advantage to the remote as a controller for PS3 games but I thought I would try anyway.  I can't turn the PS3 on with the TV remote.  I have the impression that the TV remote can turn on the PS3 but I have not figured that out yet.DIGITAL VIDEO CONTENT: To make many of these features work it is helpful to have both a separate computer and the TV connected to the internet.  When I first tried to register the TV, I was using the TV as the monitor to the computer.  I could not register the computer until I was using a computer that did not need the TV as a monitor. Other then needing both the TV and the computer at the same time, the registering process was easy.  There were a lot of steps.  You register the TV with Sony then Netflix then Amazon Video on Demand, then what ever else.Accessible through the TV are Qriocity video on demand, Amazon, Hulu +, Netfix, YouTube, Crackle, an RSS feed (Not a fully functional RSS feed) and a bunch of other stuff.  Let's start with the bunch of other stuff.  It is mostly internet shorts.  I have a friend with a Roku and it is similar to the things that he watches on his Roku.  Roku has much more content of the internet short variety. Someone will like some of these channels, I don't bother with them.There is a RSS feed but you can't add anything to it or delete anything from it. It's an RSS feed that you don't have any control over.  That said, it has episodes of Meet The Press an, the Nightly News and other things.  I have not used it but on occasion I do like to watch Meet The Press.  It's nice to know it's there.Crackle is full of things that Sony owns. That you can watch at any time.  There are 4 episodes of each of the following TV shows on Crackle ; Barney miller, Dilbert News radio, I dream of Jeannie, 10 items or less, the Jackie Chan Adventures, Vip and Bewitched  in their TV episodes folder.  There are also 8 movies.  I have not watched any of this content.  I don't know if this content changes over time.  The list of shows available was from November 2010.YouTube is surprisingly easy to use on the TV.  If you want to search for anything you have to use an onscreen keyboard.  That's laborious so I never do it.  It does connect to my YouTube account. I can bring up my favorites or subscriptions very easily.  I don't use this much because I have a computer connected to the TV but it's easy to use.You need a Netflix account to use Netflix.  I have not had any problems with streaming content through Netflix.  I use this feature often.  At the moment, you can only watch the content that is in your instant cue.  Netflix on the PS3 has a much better interface.  I imagine that there will be a software update that allows you to do more than just watch what is in your cue.  That said it's easy enough to put things in your Netflix cue if you have a computer nearby.I don't use Hulu+ because I have a computer connected to the TV.  Regular Hulu through the computer and displayed on the TV works fine.I have been very happy with Amazon Video on Demand.  You can rent or purchases new and old movies and TV shows through this service and stream them to the TV.  You can typically choose between HD and standard definition.  I have used this service for years.  I don't use cable so if there is a show I want to see that is not available on the internet I have to wait for it to come out on Netflix or purchase it episode by episode on Amazon.I don't use Qriocity but it seems like a competitor to Amazon Video on demand.  I haven't used this service.  I looked at their pricing and it was the same as Amazon for everything I looked at.DIGITAL AUDIO CONTENT: The TV has Slacker, Pandora, Berliner Philharmoniker, and NPR.  The menu also has a Lollapalooza station but it is just a standard Slacker radio station.  Slacker and Pandora are services that stream music.  They have many built in stations.  One can make a customized station simply by typing a name of a band or song and the service will build a radio station around that song or band.  Slacker works well on the TV.  You can turn the screen off while Slacker is playing or display album art. I have used Slacker for years. I was very pleased that it was on the TV at first but I don't use it because I have other speakers when I play it on my computer that are much better.  I don't use Pandora but I imagine it works in roughly the same way on the TV.The only thing I know about Berliner Philharmoniker is that you have to pay for the service.  I don't even know exactly what the service is even though I tried to figure it out by registering on their website. Slacker has classical music and so does Pandora.NPR on the TV was a big letdown.  You have access to podcasts and program s on NPR through the TV.  The interface was much easier to navigate and find things then the NPR website.  I like to listen to the Planet Money Podcast and they have it. The disappointment came when I realized that all the content that I looked at was a couple months old.  Perhaps at some point it will be updated regularly but as of Nov 2010 it is not.AUDIO: The TV doses not sound great. My understanding is that there is not enough room for base speakers in flat screen TVs. The computer sounds particularly bad when played through the TV. The computer sounds fine with different speakers.  I think there might be some equalizer settings that could make the computer sound better.  The TV needs a base speaker.  Sony does not sell a separate base speaker for this TV.  It doses sell a stand with built in speakers and a couple of sound bars with sub-woofers.  It needs something.3D:  You must buy a 3D sink transmitter and 3D glasses to make this TV into a 3D TV.  There is no good place to put the 3D sink transmitter.  It is the bunny-ears of 3D televisions.  I purchased the Alice in Wonderland 3D starter kit.  The sink transmitter has a cord that is a meter long or more and plugs into the back of the TV.  I have never seen the kind of connector that is used for the sink transmitter any were else. If you wanted an extension for the 3D transmitter I suspect you would have a hard time finding one.  That said it must be located near the TV.  The instructions say either at the top or bottom of the TV.My TV came with a \"gift\" for registering. This is separate from the registering the TV so it would function with the digital content.  For filling out a second product registry form on the internet they are sending me through the mail the \"Bolt\" in 3D and \"This is it\" with 10 minutes of 3D content.  I have not received these movies yet.It also comes with a voucher code for four 3D PS3 games including Motor Storm (demo), Pain with 3D pack (Portion of the game), Super Stardust HD in 3D (full game) and Wipeout HD in 3d (full game).I purchased the TV because the idea of 3D games was very appealing to me.  I thought that if you had a plantation move controller and a 3D TV you would interact with the 3D image.  It never occurred to me that a 3D image would only be another way to display the 2D image that is already there.  My expectations were too high thus I was disappointed.  To be fair I have not yet played all the games available in 3D.3D looks fine.  Super Stardust HD in 3D is pretty cool.  The game is 3D inside the TV but when you are killed your ship explodes out of the TV.  It's a nice effect.  Motor Storm and Grand Turismo 5 display in 3D but I experience no added benefit to displaying the games in 3D.I can't play video games for long periods of time because of eye strain.  My eyes start hurting two or three times as fast when playing games in 3D.  Watching 3D movies does not seem to cause as much eye strain (at least for me).Because there is no interaction with the 3D image and there is only marginal benefit (if any) to displaying a game in 3D, the 3D effect is only a novelty.  Once the new wears off, I will put away the 3D glasses, hide the 3D sink behind the TV and only bring it out on occasion if someone wants to see it.****I wish I purchased a less expensive TV with the same features less the 3D.****AS A COMPUTER MONITOR:  I use the TV as a computer monitor.  My understanding is that plasma TV's can have image burn in so if you're going to use the TV as a monitor you are better off getting an LCD.  It is connected to my computer through a HDMI cable but there is a place for a standard monitor cable to connect.  The HDMI is nice because it has both sound and video.  The specs for the TV said that the HDMI was computer compatible.  A computer with an HDMI out will display on any TV with an HDMI in. This TV communicated with my computer and told the computer what the optimal settings are for the TV. At least that is my understanding of what it did. The computer knows the model number of the TV and has some settings marked as optimal.If you sit too close to the TV you will noticed that there is an array of tiny black marks.  Those black marks are similar to what one would find on an old high end projector screen.  Old projector screens have the black marks to enhance contrast. You would never notice them if you were sitting on the couch or watching a TV.  It's not a problem but it's noticeable if I am sitting too close to the TV.  If I look closely at my computer monitor at work, I see a grid of black lines instead of an array of black marks. You will never notice them unless you look for them.TV WIDGETS:  This feature has great potential but as it currently exists, it's nearly useless. TV widgets are very similar to desktop widgets that became available with windows vista.  They will display the weather, stock quotes or other simple information.  They are nearly useless because they are too slow.  Setting up the weather takes forever because the setup is just as slow.  Once you have the weather widget setup and you want to see what the weather is, you can hit the widget button on the wait 30 seconds, and then select the weather widget. Once the weather widget is selected you must wait another 30 seconds and the most basic information about the current weather will be displayed.  It is just too slow for the content that is provided.  It would seem more appropriate if it displayed at least a radar map after waiting 60 seconds.  Perhaps I need to look up \"Everything is amazing and no one is happy\" on YouTube again.BOTTOM LINE: It's a very nice TV. The sound quality is not so great but probably competitive with other thin screen TVs.  I wish I purchased a less expensive TV without 3D.", "Date": "November 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect (edited review)", "Author": "J. Walker", "ReviewID": "R2F5FUCBDX04CF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this tv for only about 1 week, but here are my early impressions:I tried two different HDTVs before purchasing this one. Both were edge-lit LED and both exhibited some clouding and flashlighting (very bright screen in the corners). I took a chance on this Sony based on the quality of my past Sony products and comments/reviews from others. I have not been disappointed.First off, I would like to praise Amazon for getting this TV to me quickly and in one piece. From the time I ordered it to plugging it in was less than 6 days! Pilot was the delivery company and I have nothing but nice things to say about them.From the moment you take it out of the box you have to like the look of this tv. The front panel is all glass--no plastic bezel around the outside. It is a handsome tv. It is also quite heavy.I installed it on the included base and it sits on a low bookcase. It does swivel and the base install instructions give some cryptic indication that it tilts 6 degrees. Not sure about that one and I didn't try to force it.  Right out of the box the picture is very good. Setup is easy and with some very simple picture adjustments you will be enjoying your tv.I have windows that are directly behind me as I view the tv, but I was amazed that the glare is not overly-distracting. Yes, there is glare, but it does not diminish the view or picture quality. Your tolerance for such things may vary. I have blinds and a curtain I can draw for daytime viewing, and there is no problem at all there.  As a 3D tv, the verdict is still out. The Alice in Wonderland movie I received in the bundle with the tv does not play in my PS3, so I cannot make an evaluation of 3D movies. A couple of 3D games are available for the Playstation, and they look pretty good, particularly Wipeout HD. A very good 3D experience. I don't know much about 3D picture quality (cross-talk, ghosting, etc.), but it looks pretty cool to me.You can simulate 3D, but it really is a poor substitute and doesn't enhance the viewing much. This is the part of 3D that is pure novelty.I honestly don't care much about the 3D aspect, as this will take some time to develop. There is so little 3D content out there, it is not worth upgrading to 3D if you are happy with your current TV. I purchased this tv because it is probably the best 2D set at this price range.  The problem I had with other LEDs was the edge-lit technology. The brightness was inconsistent. This Sony uses a \"Dynamic\" edge LED backlight. This is Sony-speak indicating that it provides more precise control of the LED. There is no clouding or flashlighting or other inconsistent bright spots in the picture. The blacks are very dark and the bright scenes are vivid, but not overly bright or saturated in color.  The Motionflow 240Hz technology refers to the refresh rate of the screen. It is an improvement over 60Hz found on earlier LCDs, but most people probably could not tell the difference between 240Hz and 120Hz (found on most newer LED/LCD). I wouldn't buy this tv just because of 240Hz, but it certainly enhances the total viewing experience.  Once you activate the tv via Sony, you can use the Internet video and audio functions. There are dozens of video applications from Netflix, YouTube, Amazon on Demand, and Hulu+, to epicurious.com, crackle.com, and other similarly obscure video sites. They are good time wasters and work very well. I stream Netflix and Pandora and have had no troubles at all. I have it hard-wired for internet (I have an unreliable router), but I tested the built-in wireless-N wifi, and there were no problems.  Additionally there are plenty of energy-saving features included (LED tvs are more energy-efficient anyway). Of course, the most energy-saving thing you can do is to unplug it and read a book.  The Bravia snyc is great. I have a Sony AV and one remote will operate them both. You can run all your peripherals to the Amp and need just one HDMI to the TV. Of course, your setup will be different. I have an older PS3 that the remote will not operate, but I have heard that the new PS3 slims can take advantage of the Bravia sync (as well as bluray, cd, etc.)**EDIT** the new \"slim\" PS3 does use Bravia snyc, and you can use the TV remote to operate the bluray!**Negatives:The Internet widgets (not to be confused with the apps) are slow and pointless. Maybe the will improve on that in the future.You have to buy the 3D transmitter separately. I don't know why they couldn't build it into the tv. Yes, the glasses are expensive, but to have to buy the transmitter too, is an insult. Just make sure you get a bundle deal to save some $$.The only other negative--and what keeps this tv from getting a perfect 5 stars--is the horrible speakers. I have heard better sounding transistor radios. I have fiddled with the settings over and over, and I still cannot get a decent sound out of this tv. I have it connected to a Sony home theatre, but don't like power it on just for tv (kind of an energy waste, I think), but sometimes it's necessary.A very long review, but to sum up:Excellent (2D) picture, convenient Internet apps, included wireless-N wifi, and eye-catching styling. No early warning flags regarding 3D picture quality. Horrible audio. Overall I give it 9 out of 10.**UPDATE** I got the Alice movie to work in my PS3, so I had the opportunity to watch in 3D. The effect is very nice. With this particular movie 3D made it better. Any movie that uses a lot of CGI will benefit from 3D. When watching 3D, the screen gets a little darker, so you may have to adjust your picture options to compensate. I did not find it to be a problem as we watched in a dark room. The glasses are a little heavy and became a bit painful on my nose after about an hour. A small piece of foam (like a thick moleskin type product) on the nosepads will reduce the pain. Also, you cannot lie down or even lean slightly askew while watching, as this will negate most, if not all, of the 3D effect. Sit up straight young man! No slouching!  Make no mistake, the 3D is still a novelty at this stage, but having a quality 3D feature on one of the best-looking 2D tvs I have seen is an added bonus. I highly recommend this TV. I have bumped the star rating to 5 out of 5 (from 4/5) because the 3D element makes up for the poor sound.9.5 out of 10!", "Date": "December 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Astonishing picture", "Author": "Richard S.

The built-in sound system is not very good but with the add-on sound it's fabulous.  Blu-ray HD and HD from the cable are so amazingly good on this tv it's unbelievable. Seriously, it's the best looking tv I think I've ever seen. I didn't get the 3D add-on system because I'm just not at all interested in that.I was watching E.T. on cable in 1080i HD last night and it was like watching a completely new movie. The picture was so lifelike I felt like I was right there. Newly produced TV shows in HD are freakishly real-looking. It's almost unnerving.  I'm a professional photographer so I did a little bit of custom setup on the video to get it just right, but it was good right out of the box.Great TV... don't bother with 3D (in my opinion), get a good add-on sound system.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best 46\" TV", "Author": "Big Apple", "ReviewID": "R1WHNU28IN22HD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wasn't looking for a 3D TV, but given the incredible black friday deal I got on this TV, 3D was just a freebie. I bought the set sight unseen from TigerDirect to secure the pricing, then went to my local brick and mortar Best Buy to see the TV (in their Magnolia room) and I knew that I made a fantastic choice.  The picture is absolutely the best, sharpest, clearest picture I've seen in a LED edgelit TV.  I bought the TV primarily for watching sports, and with the 240HZ refresh rate there is absolutely no ghosting or trails - as good as any plasma.  At this point in time I'm not interested in watching 3D, so I didn't purchase any 3D glasses so I cannot provide any comment on the 3D quality; however, it's nice to know that this set is 3D capable if I ever decide to view 3D content in the future.  The wireless video streaming works fantastic - my son has watched a number of shows via Netflix with no problems.  The widgets take a while to load, but quite frankly I probably will seldom use them.  Lastly, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention how good looking this TV is (even when turned off) - the monolithic design of this TV makes the high end Samsung TVs look cheap by comparision.Pros - Picture, picture, picture!!!!! The HD is simply phenomenal.  Best picture out there period.Cons - Sound quality of built in speakers - but that is an issue with all ultra slim flat panel TVs.

It is absolutely outstanding.  The only issue I had was the set up.  If you are buying this TV for the purpose of occassionaly watching 3D programming make sure the 3D sync transmitter's 3 lines are directly facing where the viewing audience will be.  If the transmitter is off by more that 20 degrees it will cause the glasses to malfunction.  Also, while ordering 3D content via cable or satellite, be certain you go into your 3D menu and adjust the 3D image to the appropriate setting.  I spent 3 days on the phone with my cable service without a correct response.  They finally put me through to a '3D Specialist' who recognized the instantly.  (I had my 3D setting on 'Simulated' instead of 'Over/Under'.  Since 3D is such a new tecnology, most of the people working for cable or satellite providers are not trained enough on the 3D trouble-shooting.Besides the 3D content, the regualar 2D content is tremendous.

For most people, I recommend this TV because of all the image processing the TV can do with the bravia 3 engine like live color, enhanced contrast, etc. But for videophiles that don't care about any enhancements, this TV costs a bit much to not utilize them. For them, I'd recommend panasonic plasma TVs. But for everyone else that wants their TV to pop, this TV has the biggest WOW factor. Keep in mind, this TV is more of a luxury item than most other TVs. You're paying a premium for the sony brand and the aesthetics, but if you can afford it, this is one of the most beautiful piece of art IMO.

I have always liked the picture and quality of the Sony TV products.  Prior to purchasing this TV, the KDL-46NX810, I bought a KDL-40NX700 last summer, and I love it!Now for this TV....The style is fantastic!  The monolithic design (full glass panel) not only protects the screen, but gives the set a gorgeous, sleek and clean appearance.  The TV is incredibly thin, and is an engineering marvel!  This TV was intended for my family room, but I set it up in the livingroom first.  It looked so good there that I left it there.  The stand is very thin and unobtrusive, which is a great match for the monolithic screen design.  This TV just oozes high tech wonder and amazement!  That's not just flair and drama; this thing really does look that good.The picture is very nice, but not quite as nice as my NX700, the 40\" model that I also own.  I compared this TV in the store to the 8000 series Samsung.  The Samsung seemed to have a brighter screen with more natural skin tones.  I chose the Sony because of the monolithic design, which can't be beat by anything currently on the market.  I'm not that impressed with the 240Hz MotionFlow on the Sony, as there is still somewhat noticeable jitter and smearing with fast action.  I feel that the NX700, which is only 120Hz, does much better in this area.  Don't get me wrong, I still like the picture quality, but thought the motion issues would be much less noticeable with 240Hz MotionFlow technology.The TV that I purchased did not come with the 3D glasses, but I did test the 3D at the store.  I was amazed at the 3D performance!  Now I'll have to watch out for a good sale on the glasses.  3D broadcasts are extremely limited right now, so it will mainly come in handy with new movie releases that offer 3D.The sound leaves little to be desired!  I know this TV is thin, and there's not much room for decent speakers, but for the price of the set, the sound is utterly crappy.  I cannot believe Sony put this TV in production with such lousy sound quality.  You can tinker with the audio settings all you want, but you'll still be left with extremely subpar sound performance.  This is a big problem if this will be a standalone TV without a connected audio system.  My daughter loves to watch and listen to the digital music videos on Verizon FIOS, but the sound is so bad, no one in the house can stand it.  It sounds extremely tinny and hollow, so much so that you quickly choose not to listen to music through this TV.  The sound is a real big dissappointment!  Shame on you, Sony.As for the internet tools, etc, the wireless is very slow.  I would highly recommend that you run a network cable to the TV.  I have the same internet features on the NX700, but rarely use them, even with the hardwired connection.  It's just not something you'll use on a regular basis.  If you want internet on your TV, connect a laptop and use a wireless keyboard and mouse.  You'll appreciate the performance difference, and the large screen.No complaints at all with the connections offered by this TV.  Very accessible and clearly marked.  It still amazes me that they can recess all of the connections into the back of the TV and still have it be so slim.  The intergrated cable management clips located at the bottom rear center of the TV keep the cables neat, and are barely noticeable from the front of the TV.I expect reliability to be excellent, as I haven't had issues with any of the other Sony TVs that I've owned.Bottom line...An awesome TV that will be in style for many years to come, with a great picture.  If you're going to be connecting this TV to an audio system, the match makes this a a great TV.  However, the built-in sound is so disappointing that it seriously detracts from the TV, and you will not enjoy the viewing experience.  I would highly recommend that you visit a store and test the sound before you commit to this TV.", "Date": "February 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice picture but some quirks", "Author": "phoenixMa", "ReviewID": "R3KMEA36GWQXJI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this Sony Bravia TV recently.

The tv is amazingly beautiful. It has clean lines and a very minimalist look.

I have been watching 3d content and also playing Gran Turismo 5 in 3d.

I spent almost a year researching 3d TVs trying to find out which TV is the best for the money. I am a frugal shopper by far and usually only wait until I find the best deal before I purchase it. I had my eye the Samsung led 3d TV I can't remember the model, until I saw this TV. The TV is beautiful in design, very sleek and slim and light weight. The TV has a layer of anti-glare glass covering the lcd/led screen and it works! I have shinned a high powered Maglite on it whilst watching TV and had minimal glare and have no glare from the sun with my windows open. The TV has an amazing picture both in 2d and 3d, I know shutter glasses are bulky and take some time to get used to but the picture is crystal clear. This is in comparison to the LG \"cinema 3d\" tv which the picture is not as clear. The best part about the TV is the price. For being a Sony product it really is not the most expensive 3d TV on the market! Cheaper and better quality than the Samsung! Now the only downside(s) to this TV is of course the sound and the Wi-Fi is a little sensitive. You can't complain about the sound though, the TV is an inch and a half thick and weighs 71 lbs, if you want good sound buy a crt or dlp TV there's room for big speakers! The Wi-Fi sensitivity can be a little frustrating unless you have your router in the same room as the TV you will have issues time to time with the signal. It does have a lot of web apps ranging from music, TV, and internet widget apps. You will need a transmitter though to watch 3d TV but just look on amazon for one they are about half the price than they are in the stores.

I really didn't care whether I had the 3D or not but the Sony's 3D TVs seemed to have a slightly better picture than the non-3Ds.I was extremely worried about 2 things; 1)glare, as I have two walls of windows in my family room and 2)sound quality.  As far as the glare, it's ok..... better than my old CRT. I was worried that the NX with it's hard glassy front would have alot more glare than the HX800.  But all is well.... most my viewing is at night and the two ceiling lights are not annoying.  Even during the day, reflections on the screen are not bad when the picture is on.  The only softer more glare-free TVs I could find in my 3-month search/research were by LG. But it seems you give up a little detail in the picture quality for more anti-glare.Regarding sound, I had read numerous reviews about bad sound w/the sony 800s and especially the NX810.  The sound is ok.  The sound is reasonable for when you don't want the full entertainment/surround system on.  I was very worried I would have to buy a powered sound bar w/sub for everyday viewing/listing, but so far things are fine for every day listening.  If your big into movies and theatre sound, then you definately need a supplemental sound system to achieve those results.The sonys I looked at (800 series) are not as bright as the samsungs, but after many trips to various stores I decided I liked the slightly more subdued picture by sony. I actually bought the NX810 because amazon had an extremely good price on it, otherwise I would have gotten the HX810.", "Date": "May 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Yes!", "Author": "Amazoner", "ReviewID": "RFUYZNFMHV026", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Really impressed by this TV in every aspect.  Aesthetically, it is beautiful.  It comes in at just about one inch thick, which makes it easy to hang and allows for easy access to ports if it's on a stand.  The monolithic design is unreal; glass from top to bottom, side to side on the display is so elegant and makes a world of difference whether this TV is on or off.  Initially I was very concerned about a glare coming from this TV because of that reason, however it truly is a non issue.  I have a MacBook Pro with a glossy screen and every now and then it is tough to see, but with the NX810 display, light reflection is not distracting nor disturbing.  It also makes you forget about the bezel, which is also just over 1 inch thick.The features on this TV are great.  Internet video is convenient and gives many options of online content viewing from hulu plus, Amazon video, Netflix, YouTube etc...  The fact that you don't have to buy an adapter to access the internet is also a nice feature as Sony has built in wi-fi to the TV.  One caveat to its connectivity is that the TV widgets are sometimes finicky as they take a long time to load, or even at times fail to load at all.  Although this is annoying, it's not something that irks me.  Ports are plenty on the TV: 4 HDMI, digital optical, however if you do plan on using analog video (the red, white and yellow connectors) there is not a spot for them.  You'd have to run them from traditional cable.  Not an issue as this technology is now obsolete.In terms of performance, I would have to imagine that this TV is hard to beat.  Picture quality is unbelievable: crisp and clear with no flashlighting, and bright and vivid color.  Before this purchase, I had an LG 47le5400 which did not match the quality of this Bravia by any stretch.  The glossy screen has something to do with this, as a matte screen typically softens color and brightness which really takes away from the viewing experience.  As far as the 3D capabilities, I cannot speak to its performance as I have not yet purchased the add ons.  Beyond picture, this TV's speakers are below average in what you would want from your TV, but realistically are quite good for its thinness and comparatively better than most other TVs at this size.  You certainly miss some depth and bass, but watching TV is tolerable with these speakers.  I will invest in a soundbar down the road, but from reading other reviewers, I thought that it'd have to be purchased ASAP.  Again, comparing this to the LG that I returned, the speakers are considerably better.Overall, I would definitely recommend this TV to anybody.  I think there is a stigma to immediately gravitate towards a Samsung or LG based on perceived reputation, but you also pay a fairly significant difference in price for these brands.  I question what more the consumer gets with these brands?  I think the difference is marginal, if any and it seems irrational to overpay for a product with no clear added benefit.

So first I had to adjust the brightness, up contrast, lower sharpness, correct the color and then lower the blue and red on the wight-balance, change the motionflow setting and in a few days, wow, perfect.Like any glass screen it does reflect but only about 1/10 of the old cathode ray sets. I just moved a lamp in the room and now I hardly notice it, ever.The only issue I have is, after viewing the way-out-of-my-price range Aquos Quatros with the yellow pixels I can't help but notice that vibrancy missing from every other tv I see, but this one does well. The black is perfect, the tv couldn't get any inkier, the white's good, but all LED's suffer from a a bit of blue-tinge as LED's cannot produce pure light, however the white-balance let's you fix 99% of this so that you'll never notice.The motion is perfect, only on some dvd's and television does it ever seem to stammer a bit from time to time but that's not the tv's fault, my other ones do it too.So far my PS3 and Wii have never looked so good and the 3D effects are excellent as well. Mine was a bundle with the 3D set-up and blu-ray so no extra money and I like having the external 3D because it's only $40 bucks to replace where if it failed internally the entire TV would have to be serviced.This really is an excellent, near remarkable tv, once you tweak the settings and sit back you'll love every minute of watching it. The 3D is very good with limited ghosting but nothing I haven't seen in theaters and the simulated 3D can had a ton of depth, especially to hi-def games, very cool feature.What don't I like, the low pedestal looks like crap so I bought a stand the next day and mounted it about 3-feet and it looks great, the black TV mounted above 3 black glass shelves, very nice. The top and bottom of the tv are round, very hard to mount the 3D transmitter or a Wii sensor, so bad-move there. The inputs can be a pain, they have little room behind them and as my HDMI cables have static rings on them they barely fit and are a pain to connect, would have been nicer to have all inputs down one side or bottom with no obstructions. Don't ask me how it sounds, I don't care, I have a $3000 surround system, I haven't used TV speakers in 10 years.All I can say is, if you want an LCD, get a Sony Bravia if you can't afford the Sharp quad-pixel. The LED back-lighting with local dimming really gets the dark and light contrast perfect, the picture is crystal clear from a blu-ray or HD video game and as good as a Cable ( i have fios) can get. The 3D is very nice even in a relatively bright room in the afternoon and the price is great.

I was very happy when Amazon offered this Sony LED TV at a price far lower than any other I had seen at the time.  I am quite pleased with most aspects of the product, with the exception of the sound of the built-in speakers.  That said, I only watch the set through my home theater's separate audio system, so the less than stellar built-in audio is not really an issue for me.  There's only so much high-fidelity one can expect from a slim television and unfortunately the quality of speakers in all slim LED sets has not kept up with that of the video.More important in the buying process was the trouble I had when the set was initially delivered.  It arrived via UPS ground with a shattered glass screen in the box.  Fortunately, the retailer's warehouse was a two-hour drive from my home, so I had the time and could arrange to return the product and exchange it for another myself.  The retailer was very helpful in the process and I am grateful they were located within a somewhat reasonable driving distance so I didn't have to risk receiving another item damaged in shipping.When I arrived at the retailer's warehouse I was shown an entire row of other returned television sets stacked up which were also damaged in transit.  The warehouse manager expressed his frustration with UPS for the way in which they handle the merchandise.  I asked if FedEx was any better and he said they were worse - they had experienced many more returned damaged TV's when shipping through FedEx.  Even though the retailer is advised to place the manufacturer's box within another padded shipping box (which this retailer did) the problem lies squarely at the feet of the shipping companies because of the way they handle the boxes.  I was told that the retailer tried to further protect their products by opening the manufacturer's box and adding more padding to them, but many customer's then incorrectly perceived that they were receiving returned \"Open-Box\" items rather than brand new TV's.I think the whole shipment dilemma for such an expensive product made with glass is a reason for concern when making a purchase that is to be shipped by a company other than the manufacturer.  It all worked out well for me in the end and I saved hundreds of dollars from buying at a retail store, but I will not buy a television in this manner in the future.", "Date": "January 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "WOW------------WOW", "Author": "raycal", "ReviewID": "R1AK3A49ZYL8ST", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a football nut with limitedmobility.

These were/are Samsungs TOL TV's and for the money we were not to pleased with the end results. Which Brings us to the Sony, we saw this TV at Costco and the style and look are Phenomonal the picture is beautiful for a LCD which most and especially Sony's tend to wash out, Plasma still rules in that department, this TV minimized the effect and displays Blacks and deep colors that rival the Plasma we gave to the kids.  Sony Products can either be exceedlingly impressive or exceedlingly unimpressive, we think this TV is impressive and follows up with one of the best looking sets out there, compared to Samsung it is understated but insteads wows you with a look that exudes quality and simply blends into the living space as if it's a piece of Art or Furniture, like it was made to fit on that wall or stand.  The picture needs minor tweaking at best, we have a video test disc that walks you through the setup process.  The pleasent part of this set is even off it makes a subtle statement and again blends into the enviorment as if it's part of the room, Sony deserves alcholades on the design.Like most man products there is always some short coming, the BIGGEST complaint we have is the anemic speakers built into this set, wow Sony what were you thinking, they fire off the rear of the TV BooBoo #1 they are underpowered BooBoo #2, thankfully Sams had a Sony Speaker bar that is made for Sony TV's, imagine that and for $119 bucks the TV now sounds as nice as it looks.  The other caveat is the 3D Emitter is a add-on, really not a deal breaker as far as I am concerned 3D gives me a headache after about a 1/2 hour watching it?  Costco offered it with 2 pair of glasses and Alice in Wonderland 3D and the whole set-up with rebates was $1149, I think a spectacular price for a top of the line TV that worked out of the box and is typical Sony Quality and in this case a rather impressive product as well.  In short this TV should be on your short list when shopping, as for LCD Tv's over 1500 bucks, I wouldn't waste my time at this time I'm not sure that any LCD gives any improvement over others to justify spending more than 1500 dollars for a LCD.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "S.D.A", "ReviewID": "R1CQIUV75ZBWS8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first flat panel so needless to say I like it over what I had before.

We love it except for the sound quality. That's why I'm not giving a five star rating. Eventually, we bought a Bose sound system and always mute the TV. I guess it is hard to have good sound quality when the machine is so thin.We use it to watch netflix and youtube. But mainly, we use it to watch directv. It is a little disappointing to find that a lot of the programs we watch are not in HD. But for the ones in HD, the picture quality is super. The incoming signals vary from 480i to 1080i. Personally, I feel the picture quality is acceptable for programs with 720i or higher definitions. Unfortunately, some TV programs are broadcast with 480i, and they look worse on this TV than on our old 27\" Sony Trinitron. My husband loves the picture quality for ball games, which are usually in 1080p.", "Date": "March 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "I LOVE SONY!", "Author": "Leondras R.

When you get it home, depending on your lighting the picture quality may or may not look great. If it doesn't this TV has a LOT of adjustments which can be quite confusing to all but the extremely tech savvy. To get the PQ just right in your home the NX810 may need pro calibration adding to the overall cost of the TV.This TV has a LOT of internet features including a WiFi connection. WiFi/internet connected products such as TV's, Blu Ray players and Home Theater AVR's can create redundancy so make sure by purchasing this TV you need or want all the internet stuff it can do, you're paying for it and you don't need to pay for it over and over if you already have it on another product. I think this TV has fantastic picture quality after it has been calibrated and/or tweaked to get it. Right out of the box i thought the colors to be off and it took quite some time to get them to my idea or right due to all the settings inside the menu.I would recommend this product only after you give serious considerations to what i have stated above. If you don't mind tweaking the PQ and do not have a lot of other devices that receive internet content you will really enjoy playing with the NX810.The KDL46810 does have a downside, for some it may be a deal breaker. The sound quality (especially for the amount of money you are going to lay out for this HDTV) is sub-par at BEST and many will consider it terrible. Other reviews will recommend a sound bar or a home theater surround system and considering what it cost maybe many already have such a thing or will not mind laying out extra money for it. If you do not have a sound bar or an elaborate surround AVR system you may very well be VERY or TERERIBLY disappointed with the speakers and sound output from this TV. This TV is an upgrade from a 5 year old Westinghouse HDTV for me and my old Westy had far better sound quality. The NX has a better picture and way more bells and whistles but the sound, to be honest, leaves a lot to be desired.Pros: Great Picture quality, lots of bells and whistles, internet connectivity via wifi. The 3D feature is pretty cool.Cons: It might be too thin to produce good sound quality, the speakers do not sound good, lots of bells and whistles, maybe to many. Is a bit pricey as compared to its competitors with like features? I have seen better 3D when auditioning competitors.Edit: The speakers are still terrible but much like the HD PQ settings needing to be tweaked so do the HDTV 3D settings and that can only be done while the TV is in 3D mode. After a little messing around with the menus while watching 3D content this TV has outstanding 3D picture quality and effect.I still rate it 4 stars because the speakers suck!", "Date": "March 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sony 810", "Author": "Ten Penny", "ReviewID": "R3AUSC1V8BOP81", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great picture.looks great on or off.love the wi fi.I do not have all I need to watch 3D, and I think the top mount transmitter is just to after market looking for Sony.The sound is a bit under sized for the picture.All in all it's a beautiful TV worth the money.", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "For Hard working people", "Author": "K.
