{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent LCD", "Author": "David McLeod", "ReviewID": "RZBFYOYRMAAWP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Summary:I am extremely pleased with this LCD.  The picture is bright and clear and the colors are excellent.  I am completely satisfied with the purchase and recommend this device to anyone.Expanded Review:First, I defined my goals: From about 8 feet away I want to watch High Definition DVD's at 1080p, watch High Definition television including local channels, connect some gaming consoles, connect a PC, and connect my surround sound receiver.I looked at different products for a year.  I would compare the appearance between the different sets in the store, read online reviews, talked to friends, and read product specifications.I decided on the following and intended to act before the end of summer: I would obtain a decent 42\" LCD with all of the necessary connectors for under $1600, I would purchase a PS3 for Blu-ray as well as HD gaming with the bonus that it will upconvert my current DVD's, and upgrade my current cable service to HD for HD television viewing. I figured to spend about $2000-$2200.When the PS3 price dropped to $500 it figured it was time to move.  The contenders after my research included the Samsung, Sony, LG, and the Westinghouse LVM-42W2. Most were over the limit to what I was comfortable spending so it came down to the LVM-42w2.  When I went to find it I discovered the TX-42F430S that had been recently introduced. Additionally it was available at a local yellow tagged electronics superstore for the best price advertised. I was able to view this unit side by side with the other available LCD's and it looked just as good, to me, as much more expensive models.  I realized however that the signal being pumped into those devices on the wall was not a 1080p signal and that the picture at home might look different. At that point I figured it was bright, the colors were coming through, the menu system was functional, and it was the lowest priced 42\" 1080p LCD available ($1299). I bought it with a matching of the online deal that threw in a Sony HT-DDW790 home theater system and a 60 day in house price match.  The following Sunday 7/29 it went on sale for $1099.  I got the price match ($200 back) and sold the HT system for $120.  So, total for this system with PS3 was right about $1500 plus cables, controllers, Blu-ray Planet Earth, and a couple of games for the PS3. I feel good.Results:1. I have the PS3 connected to one of the four(!) HDMI connectors and it looks awesome.  Motorstorm at 720p is excellent and Planet Earth at 1080p is unbelievable.  I had to get the blue tooth remote for playing movies, you can do it with the controller but it's a pain. Most of the upconverted DVD's look incredible, much better than on standard def TV, this was much better than I expected and for someone not hypersensitive it would be hard to differentiate it from some native HD or Blu-ray DVD's.2. HD Digital Cable content through the component connection looks very good.  Standard Definition looks like garbage, but this is expected of all HD LCD's, the pixels on the LCD display the picture in all it's ugly glory.  In all my research, I have not come across a way to watch standard def TV and it not look bad.  It's functional, and viewable if you don't expand the screen and let it display in 4:3, but a step down when viewing most of the normal TV content.  One can only hope that more and more channels come to HD format.3. I have my PC, Wii, and PS2 (only for guitar hero) hooked up though the home theater receiver via S-video at the moment and it serves. I want to move the PC to the VGA connector (I need a new dual head video card), the Wii to the component connection, and the PS2 directly to the S-video in the future.4. I have a digital optical cable running from the output on the LCD to the HT receiver and it sounds good.  The interal LCD speakers can be turned off so that only the HT system is used.So, I am very happy. I hope this helps some of you still looking. I relied heavily on comments about the products here and I wanted to return the favor.", "Date": "August 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "Not Perfect But An Excellent Budget Set", "Author": "JazzMann \"Jazz-Wine-Sun\"", "ReviewID": "RCEZNWVFJ6VE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The picture on this set is quite outstanding, sharp, snappy and capable of incredible detail. The on-screen menu is excellent as well. Connectivity is excellent. it has four HDMI connections!!!, 2 component video connections (YPbPr), a VGA connection, audio SPIDF out, S-Video, numerous analog audio ins/outs etc. The sound system is quite good with a built-in subwoofer.The set has (had) a few flaws:1. You will see some pixel-ating in very dark areas. The picture snaps back when the scene brightens up again. This improves somewhat as the set 'breaks-in'. After about 20 hours of use and adjusting the settings, now, it's a very minor issue for me. ALL LCDs are prone to this to some degree or another.2. I first heard soft popping noises when listening to DVDs (only) with an HDMI connection. The noise would come and go intermittently. This issue went away completely after about 20 hours of use. (I can't explain it). Also, this can be worked around if you use a Home Theater Receiver.You will find that ALL LCDs are going to have some bugs. The TX-42F430S gives you a superb picture at a low price. I recommend it.", "Date": "August 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great price for a great product", "Author": "D. Berube \"Picky\"", "ReviewID": "R36N3DYMBQ7K1I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We were looking for a lot of function for a little price.  This true 1080p TV has multiple inputs for audiophiles and has a true 1080p pc connection. The set will automatically read the source and adjust itself appropriately... no having to \"switch\" from DVD, PC or cable... the TV does it for you!!!Since we've only had it a month, the verdict is still out on the longevity factor, but the initial WOW factor of the picture quality and functionality has set this TV as a great alternative to the high priced famous brands.  We paid about 1/2 the cost of the same 42\" TV in the high end brands and feel we received a top notch product.  We had the opportunity to see this TV in use against all the other brands (at the yellow price tag store) we were looking at and we absolutely loved the picture, the features and the look of the TV.  Westinghouse went with a matt black finish which is different from everyone else, it looks stylish hanging on the wall and is very easy to keep clean.  We are so impressed that we are considering the 47\" to replace our perfectly good 32\" livingroom TV.Again, other than the question of how long will it last (which is why we are giving this only 4 stars and not 5 - I bought a coverage plan to protect myself and the price was still way below that of the high end famous brand name tvs)  if it lasts 5 years it was worth it!!!UPDATE:  5 stars it is.  This TV is still going strong... great computer monitor/tv... picture is awesome.  I'm sad that they no longer make this TV.", "Date": "June 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent value", "Author": "David R. Lopez", "ReviewID": "R2SGX4C2UU88N7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been sittting on the fence with this LCD purchase. I already own a 32 inch LCD westy that has been a good set even with its quirks being a two year old set. I read many reviews on this 42 inch Westy TX-42F430S and was scared of these people saying thae that the HDMI didn't work and couldn't be worked manually as this set has an automatic source feature others don't. Well I purchased this set and I'm glad I did. The source detection works great. It works on any new source that is turned on like the DVD on composite switched as soon as I turned it on. You can switch back to the HDMI source by pushing the HDMI button on the remote, push it again for the next HDMI source input and its that easy. The picture out of the box is way too bright just like the ones in the big box store. The default settings are not good like on most LCD sets purchased. The employees at the big box store are not good at setting them up. The set also needs to be set up on each source and then it retains the settings, my two year old set did not do that. the picture is stuning and the 4 HDMI inputs, 2 composite as well as the VGA input are all great features. I'm very satisfied with this purchase and would highly reccommend it to others.

How could I not ditch my 32\" 720p and upgrade? My 32\" ViewSonic 720p LCD was great and lasted for two years, but its lack of more than one HDMI and horrible menu functionality led me to this Westinghouse 42\" HDTV.The ViewSonic I had had one input of each type, and one button to scroll through each. This wasn't that bad, but the 10 second start up delay was. Universal remotes were near impossible to program (Harmony 520 was mine) due to delay's between startup and even input switching. The one HDMI port was a problem too. These were the main problems I was looking to address.Firstly, it was $1200 even after tax and a 4 year warranty. Had to get the warranty, as Westinghouse has been known to have power related issues, banding, etc. So, for the price, it cannot be beat. Even Best Buy's \"cheap priced\" brand Insignia was one hundred bucks more for the same thing. I observed the picture clarity and color next to similar sized Sony/Samsung/etc. that looked like the color had been optimized, where as the Westinghouse had not. I have seen this scheme before, and knew that HDTV's never look the same in store, with a connection split a million ways, as it would at home. In store, the color looked washed out, but clear, compared to the others next to it. My friend has a 46\" Westinghouse 720p LCD and was wonderful for the $1600 he paid a year ago, so I knew the brand had promise.Secondly, no power issues: yet. Not saying it may not, but it hasn't. The color at home is perfect with the only thing to mention is that black's are not solid black. But! They do look well enough to justify the price difference. I have it set to 100% brightness in my room, where light shines thoroughly with no reflection. I have yet to tweak the colors, but I prefer not to and to do so with my systems.Thirdly, the 4 HDMI ports is the best idea for a HDTV ever. Having 1 or 2 is a joke, more is always better than less. So, 1 for PS3, 1 for XBOX360, 1 for HD-upconvert DVD player and 1 open (DVR if I had one). The only downside is that there is only 1 remote button for HDMI, but autosource takes care of that....Fourthly, the autosource detection is great. You turn something on connected to it, and it automatically switches. The only thing I've noticed is that if I use VGA, it won't allow switching to the proper HDMI source, but I was only testing the VGA from my computer, I don't use it anymore.Fifthly, the LCD style is different than conventional. The pixels are not a single pixel, it is a tri-color pixel, where the blue, green and red are separated. My ViewSonic was a single style, but there is hardly a difference. This is just in case anyone wanted to know.Sixthly, to contrast my ViewSonic's delays, there are NONE with this HDTV. The only delay is user-set, the start up. To save $25 a year, you can have the HDTV delay start up to conserve energy, but if you do not, the HDTV is pre-prepped to start and starts within a second. Channels are near instant, and inputs are slightly delayed, as expected with any TV.Seventhly, I have a PS3, XBOX360 and upconverting HDMI DVD player connected through HDMI. All connect properly and look perfect on the TV. PS3 games, XBOX360 games, Blu-Ray through PS3 and HD-DVD through the XBOX360 HD-DVD Drive all look just like they should and most likely would on a more expensive HDTV. It is now easier to play multi-player games with a better resolution and split screen. Can't complain about anything.Finally, there are other things to comment on, but these are the main concerns I was considering with this HDTV. I have yet to have any of the problems common with the brand, but the warranty will handle any that may occur. Hopefully this may answer or dismay any doubts you may have, but I would prefer to buy it in store, rather than dealing with any shipping costs, may they occur.I may add more to the review later, but as for now this is it.", "Date": "November 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "Absolute Junk", "Author": "T.

This allowed me to compare against other sets on a side-by-side basis, and the analysis I kept coming back to was this: was there any set on the wall that was markedly better than this picture?  Figure the next 1080p set is priced at around $1,500 - $1,600, a 35% - 40% premium over this Westinghouse.  I simply could not justify the price premium for name plate alone.That said, I have a few quibbles.  I find the sound output \"auto-recognize\" feature to be a little finnicky: if there's no video, the set won't output any sound.  That said, the 4 HDMI inputs and multiple other imput options are a godsend; given my relatively layperson audio needs, I actually use the set as sort of an audio hub, outputting all sound via an optical cable to my home theater receiver (which is severely limited in its inputs).All in all, I feel I've gotten tremendous value for the money.

Despite it's minor setbacks I have really enjoyed it.  My goal was to consolidate my PC and AV setups into one.  I have heard that using PCs on plasmas can cause burn in so I opted for an LCD.  I wasn't looking for a very large display so I opted for a 37\"-42\".  I also didn't want to spend a lot of money.  I checked out other reviews and the Westinghouse caught my eye.

The unit worked fine up until the summer of 2010.  That's about the time I began to notice burn-in/image retention on my screen, which included faint outlines/shadows of network logos (ESPN), scoreboards, and PS3 game images.  I tried every method under the sun to rid my TV screen of the burn-in (including DVDs of black and white images, powering the TV off for days, and keeping it on a snowy image for hours at a time), but no luck.  So I contacted Best Buy, and they dispatched a local HDTV technician to my apartment to confirm that my unit had burn-in; unfortunately Best Buy stated that my extended warranty does NOT cover burn-in.  They argued that the 3-year Best Buy warranty is a reflection and extension of the 1-year Westinghouse manufacturer's warranty, so they would only cover what Westinghouse Digital covers in their warranty.  I then contacted Westinghouse about the issue, and they stated that they do not cover burn-in because they believe LCDs (at least not their brand) do not incur burn-in and if mine did, then it was \"customer induced\" meaning it was MY fault.Westinghoue Digital's reasoning for not covering burn-in is hogwash because I did nothing abnormal to my TV in the 2 years that I had it, so the burn-in was not my fault.  They wouldn't even consider the idea that my unit was poorly made or defective, and they refused to replace or repair my HDTV after months of battling with them.  So now I'm stuck with an HDTV that has image retention and a 3-year extended warranty ($150) that has been pretty much useless.Needless to say, I will NEVER, EVER purchase an HDTV or any other product from Westinghouse Digital, and I would advise anyone else to be leery of doing the same.

I compared it to several other TVs they had on sale and finally took this thing home. It was easy to set up and easy to use. The picture was great and games played nicely on it.The problem came about 6 months later when the NO INPUT burned into the screen. I tried to white it out by hooking the TV up to the PC and leaving a white screen on and a black one for several hours a day. This did reduce the image but never rid the set of it.Now here it is almost 4 years later and the TV is still working. The picture is still great when watching movies and playing games. However, it is starting to 'hold' images. You will see your HUD from games still on the screen when you go back to the menu or you will see NETFLIX still on the screen as your movie starts. This doesn't bother me so much b/c it doesn't last long.The HDMI ports will decide on their own to stop working. I will turn the tv on and then the PS3/360/PC and will hear the sound out of the stereo system but nothing on the screen. It is an easy fix to just hold down the power button on the TV to reset the HDMIs and it is back to normal.When all is said and done I just expect more out of my $1100, for that matter $500.

However, when looking for a stand alone blu ray disc player....buyer beware. I purchased the Panasonic BD55 because CNET rated it excellent at hd playback as well as excellent at upconverting regular dvds. Unfortunately I came across a firmware issue - I cannot use the HDMI connection. Panasonic uses a higher version of the HDMI software than the tv does - incompatibility renders my player unable to produce true HD. HUGE BUMMER!!!!!!!  Spoke with Panasonic, spoke with Westinghouse. There is no backward compatibility and Westinghouse has no solution in the works for customers. So beware with this company - they say they are providing high end electronics at fair prices but they've gone cheap on the software & essentially tells its customers 'sorry we cant help you'. I dont like that attitude at all. Will make me think twice about recommending this product to anyone - actually thinking about replacing it even though its only several months old.

I have been thinking of buying a 1080p LCD HDTV for some time now, perhaps as many people have and finally purchased this one and thought to add to the reviews for what it is worth.Many people have expressed the pros and cons, problems, or none, concerns and such, and I thought to try to add to that list, though the list by others is rather exhaustive in some respects.The picture is stunning with 1080i content, and even 720p is impressive as well, the standard 480i is weaker for the most part, but that is to be expected as I suppose, but still watchable if one desires.It has great clarity, loose threads on clothing can be seen, heavy makeup on women, the little bumps, hairs on peoples skin, veins in eyes, mottled appearance of skin, freckles and such, or lack thereof. It's terrific and am very pleased with that.Colors seem true, and the panel itself to the eyes not busy, but quiet, with very little pixel movement on quality feeds and proper lighting.It exhibits great depth of field at times. Good quality photography can bring out a three dimensional feel.Other things: it changes channels rather quickly for digital, appearance is a personal thing, but I like the way it looks,I receive broadcast over the air, so that is all I can comment on, but that is where is supposed to shine anyway.Content such as evening prime time shows in 1080i are very pleasing to watch, The Today show, the Tonight show, and Letterman, Saturday Night live and things of that nature one has to be impressed with the TV.Football has its variations depending on the feed, the cameras used, the stadium and lighting, night games, and such. But overall very pleased and that is just because of the limitations imposed by the conditions, not the TV itself. With poorer feeds there can be some pixeling on long shots, replays and such, but on good feeds, and lighting, and cameras barely noticeable. Overall I would think a sports fan would not be unhappy with this HDTV.Here is something that might be of help to those that have been trying to find a video profile to use that is pleasing, well, pleasing to me at least. I did I take some time to research video profiles, finding one on a review at Cnet, and have modified that video profile, and am pleased with that for most viewing.I took one of the profiles, Game in this instance and modified it as follows. Brightness 55, Contrast 50, Saturation 42, Hue 48, Sharpness 15, Backlight 100, Color Temperature (Neutral), on the next menu (Calibration), Deinterlace (on), 3D Comb Filter (on), Skin Tone 55, Color Temperature (Neutral), Dynamic Contrast (on), Black Adjustment 55, White Adjustment 50, Saturation 42, Hue 48, Sharpness 15, Backlight 100. (By the way the Dynamic Contrast on mine does work.) You can try this if you like, and see if it works for you. I do get deep blacks this way, and people look natural, and scenes in dimly lit areas still come through, it has a very natural look to it, not a punchy look to draw attention like store displays. It's not overly bright for dimly lit rooms, and all this, of course, in my estimation.Others have expressed a weakness with Blacks, after video profiling I have no problems with the blacks not being black enough.Anyway, its late in the game for this model, and I mainly wanted to add the video profile for others that may be looking for one. Enjoy your viewing if you happen to have one, or are thinking about purchasing one.Oh, by the way, this is my sixth Westinghouse LCD Product and have been very pleased with them.

I like the TV but it is a little buggy.  One reviewer said that it didn't remember things from the remote well.  I thought that was a jest but I've had the same experience.  You enter stuff on the remote but it's different when you go back sometimes.  Weird.  It has easy to use menus however and it will eventually remember the settings correctly if you put them in a time or two.  Maybe I did something wrong, I'm not really sure.  It could be that you have to do it a certain way for it to remember the setting.My biggest two problems so far with the TV are the service port will not load updated firmware and the default picture quality.  Westinghouse is working on the issue with the service port.  They've called me several times now.  Since I don't have a big problem with anything hardware related I'm not all that concerned about that one.The second annoyance is the default picture setting SUCK.  It's a monitor though in essence with a tuner and as such it can be adjusted to a perfect picture unless something is really wrong.  I own a spider used to calibrate monitors but so far I have not used it.  I just used someone elses settings from a forum and the picture is VERY nice after making the changes.  It seems stupid to me Westinghouse would ship it with uncalibrated settings as the \"default\".The picture is beautiful though.  It makes non HD DVD's look poor quality after watching HD for a while.  It reminds me of going back to VHS at times.

I play alot of video games and watch alot of shows, both on disc and on television.  So, I needed a display that worked well for all my requirements.  I settled on LCD, and my space dictated I look at a 42\" set.  My choices had narrowed to two: the Toshiba (also 1080p)and the Westinghouse.  Both displays were showing hockey from a set-top HD box, via component cables.  Luckily, they were also side-by-side.  Needless to say, my eyes were sold on the Westinghouse.  Perhaps it is in the eye of the beholder, but the colours were much more vivid on the Westinghouse.In any case, I now have the following setup:a) HD set-top cable box (via HDMI)b) XBox 360 (through VGA)...for those with non-Elite 360s that do not have HDMI ports, a VGA connection is the only way you will get 1080p resolution.c) HD-DVD Player (XBOX 360 add-on)d) Nintendo Wii (through Component cables)SD programs and nintendo Wii games look plain (because 480p on a HDTV will and the Wii's graphics are pretty crappy).  Channels like HDNET, Discovery HD, Nat'l Geographic....just look FANTASTIC.  I'll watch water drop off a leaf in 1080i on this TV!!  HD-DVD movies (and I would guess the Blu-Ray ones as well) are even better!!  Chronicles of Riddick is a great one to showcase this TV's capabilities.As for games, Gears of War never looked so good!

I don't regret the purchase at all, but over the years I've had two main problems. BTW, I don't use the TV's speakers at all.1) Sometimes while switching between various HDMI inputs the TV will simply fail to recognize, so I need to turn it on and off. Not a huge problem.2) Image Retention. This is a big problem, actually. The \"no input selected\" box has been permanently burned into the top of screen faintly. Noticed it months if not a year or two ago and it's never gone away, even with long power-downs. Maybe playing with bright or dark only images would fix, but I doubt it. There appear also to be, noticeable on lighter images, black vertical bars to either side of the screen. There are several on each side and they do not appear to coincide with the placement of 4:3 screens. The third IR issue is if the TV is warmed up and an image paused, it will sometimes remain there as a ghost. For example, if I have something paused for a long time--like 15-20 minutes, I can see ghost images of faces or logos for 5 minutes if not longer while I resume play.I'd buy another Westinghouse if the price was right.
