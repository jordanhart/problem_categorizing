The picture from the FiOS HD channels is outstanding. Jump-out-at-you images with rich color and no banding. From the DVD, its still quite good due the upconverting to 1080i.  Of course, until I buy a Blue-Ray or HD DVD and associated disks, I won't be able to see true 1080p.One of the customer reviewers here (Araki on 4/5/07) deplored the sound from the TV speakers. He said that \"this may not be an issue if not an audiophile\" to which I say that this is not an issue if you ARE an audiophile because no audiophile listens to TV speaker sound.  All TV's use small cheap speakers, knowing that  audiophiles or home theater movie buffs will have separate reciever/multiple speaker setups. In my case, I'm running the audio through a Sony STR-DG510 receiver into a Cambridge Ensemble 208 system (two speakers + a subwolfer).The product discription here of the LC52D92U is very sparse and confused.  The 92U is an upgrade of the 62U and just came out in Jan 2007, so First Date Available at Amazon couldn't have been April 2005.  Also, none of the notable upgrade features are even mentioned!!  Its the first LCD HDTV with a 120 HZ refresh rate (other sets are 60 or 75 HZ) so that pixel artifacts seem to have finally been eliminated from fast action scenes.  At least I haven't noticed any so far. Also with this model, Sharp has greatly improved on the viewing angle and the black color rendition -  you can see this at any store when you view the 92U in comparison to the earlier 62U or any other LCD set. I suggest going to the Sharp site to read a much more comprehensive product description.All in all, IMO this is the best LCD HDTV on the market at the present time.", "Date": "April 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "I'm Glad I Picked The LC-52D92U Over The Sony KDL-52XBR2", "Author": "JOHN", "ReviewID": "R343X6GFP32PFG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We'll, I finally decided to purchase the Sharp LC-52D92U over the Sony KDL-52XBR2. This decision took me about 4 weeks to make, with multiple trips to local retailers to compare the sets in action, and reading many online reviews.If you ask store personnel what is the better of the two, most will say the Sony. After watching both sets in action many, many times, it's just not so. The picture quality, sharpness, and black levels on the Sharp are truly amazing. The Sony is a good TV, just not worth over a thousand dollars more! I purchased mine from the internet for $3,200 delivered.I highly recommend this TV to everyone.", "Date": "April 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great TV, Great Price, Great Everything", "Author": "joetagaz \"joetagaz\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZHJCGDW02HUM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like most of you, I spent a lot of time trying to decide what I wanted. I ruled out rear projection because of the viewing angle, I ruled out plasma because I have a very bright room. So I decided to buy a LCD.I narrowed my search down to the Samsung 52\" and the Sony.  When I saw the Samsung in the store I was turned off.  For some reason the screen is almost as reflective as a plasma.  The Sony was very nice, but $1,000 more than anything else. It wasn't that nice.When I saw the $3299 price from 6ave Electronics here on Amazon I thought something wasn't right. This is a $4,299 list television. They even tossed in free delivery (it took a week, but it seemed like a month) and they didn't collect sales tax.I asked Best Buy if they'd price match it.  The store manager actually said that products bought on Amazon have the serial number removed so you don't get a warranty and that's how they can sell it for less; Best Buy wanted list price for this TV but was willing to sell it for $3,799.I'm happy to say my TV has a serial number (not like I didn't think it wouldn't) and I couldn't be happier.I installed the speaker and the stand, hooked it up and turned it on.  At first I thought, WOW, that's bright! But, the factory had it set to \"dynamic\". I kicked it down to \"standard\" and the picture was just amazing.The menu system is very intuitive with help available so you don't get lost.Standard def. programs look good, but they remind you of what a letdown SD is over HD. We need more content!!I read some reviews about the audio not being up to par.  I have no idea. I'm hooked up through a home theater system with 5.1 surround sound which, IMHO, is the only way to enjoy HD content.To summarize: the TV is first rate, picture, setup, etc. Delivery was as advertised. The only thing that'll confuse you are all the input options on the back of the TV.  I'm only using 3 (Cable, DVD, VCR) but there's room to add anything that comes down the road.You will not be disappointed with this TV.One month later.  Still enjoying this TV. But, and this isn't a comment on Sharp but all HDTV's, you really start to notice that maybe the broadcast industry isn't quite ready yet.  What I mean is, some of the SD programs look OK, some are a bit fuzzy and all of them naturally are in the old format. You can live with it.  But, you'll also notice that some of the older programs that are being broadcast on HD channels aren't all that wonderful either.  It's essentially the old content, different channel.  What shocks you after awhile is that you have a clearer picture many times on a SD CRT than your new expensive HDTV. Why? simple, that higher resolution magnifies the flaws with the old (480) content so you see everything, good and bad, bigger and sometimes it's not very pretty.Like I said, this isn't a Sharp LCD issue. I have friends that own Toshiba, Sony and Samsung, LCD, plasma, and rear projection and they would all make the same observation.  Careful when you're shopping in the store; they show Blu-ray DVD's. Ask the sales person to switch the TV to a SD channel so you can see what I'm talking about.February, 2009 can't come soon enough but please don't expect the same crystal clear picture that you see on a DVD when you're watching cable.This just in... Check out the November, 2007 issue of Consumer Reports. In their quick picks for LCD TV's they say if you want a jumbo screen (52 inch and up apparently) buy the Sharp Aquos LC-52D92U.  Their top rated LCD is the Samsung LN-T4661F but it's a 46 incher, the 52 inch Samsung comes in below the Sharp.Eight months later (time flies when you're watching HD!). I still have nothing negative to say about this TV. The picture is as crisp as ever, it's easy to use, no banding, no dead pixels, everything is the way it was the day I bought it.  I did upgrade my home theater system. I put in a Yamaha RX-V1800 audio-video receiver along with a terrific 5.1 speaker set from Aperion Audio.  I did have an old Pioneer Elite AVR with Bose speakers.  The difference is more than noticeable (both video and audio).And, I did listen to the Sharp's internal speakers for a few weeks while I waited for the new equipment. It wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either.", "Date": "August 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great picture", "Author": "A. Matheny", "ReviewID": "R3T9MOZBH8E6N2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent a long time looking at Sony, Samsung, and Sharp LCD TV's in the 50\" range, and was put off by the banding and clouding issues until the Sharp Aquos \"92\" series came along.  I figured they had solved the banding issue and took my chances, although I paid more by ordering through Crutchfield as \"insurance,\" if there turned out to be any problems.  Plus, I was getting a whole system; so I needed their consulting advice which turned out very useful.  Their free shipping and white-glove delivery was great, and the TV worked perfectly right out of the box.Once fully installed on the wall and running through the Scientific Atlanta HD DVR cable box (Cox Cable), the picture was amazing.  I set it up so that the sound comes from my Onkyo receiver (HDMI-switching).  I added an upconverting (1080p) Panasonic DVD player (two HDMI's into the receiver from the cable box and the DVD, and only one HDMI, and nothing else, out to the TV).  This works really well.The TV is perfect.  Watching an NBA basketball game in full HD is actually better than being there, an almost surreal experience, especially when the picture comes from the sky cam.  The fast response time, very high contrast, etc., means no compromises.I think this is the best 1080p LCD out there.  In doing research for this purchase, I found it very hard to compare LCD TV's at retail stores like Best Buy.  Their setups or feeds must not do justice to some TV's.Bottom line:  no \"banding\" after 6 weeks of viewing, great picture, upconverts nicely, excellent contrast and viewing angle, never even planned to use the speakers that came with it, so sound quality is not an issue.", "Date": "May 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "Exceeds Expectations", "Author": "Art", "ReviewID": "R3VNO8J83O4D5P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This HD LCD TV from Sharp is a joy to watch. The interface for digging into the deeper features is easy to grasp and logically laid out. You can choose appropriate labels for your inputs, which helps my wife greatly.I bought this TV instead of the Sony based on a small difference in video quality. When side-by-side with the comparable Sony, the Sharp had brighter whites, blacker blacks, and crisper motion display. The viewing angle on this model far exceeds what you get on most other LCDs. The numbers quoted are very real. You can move anywhere in the room and the picture stays sharp and bright. There aren't any BEST seats in the living room any more.Some audio freaks won't like the audio out of the smallish speakers, but I found them to be OK. Not great, just OK. Mostly to get more volume and some kind of surround sound effect, I purchased the Bose 3-2-1 2.1 surround sound system. Now I have the awesome sound to go with the awesome picture.Regular def looks alright. HD looks terrific. AppleTV works with aplomb on this set. Viewing pictures is impressive and the colors really punch out. You have control over color, of course. And the S. Stretch option for viewing other formats other than 16:9 is useful. I'd rather have a 'smart' combination of stretching and cropping than view black bars. After a while, you don't even notice the stretching. You can also opt to keep all the picture and stretch it more, which I find offensive. Or you can go with the black bars. It's all the same button on the remote.The TV works very well with the remotes that come with your DiSH satellite system. I prefer to use these as all-in-ones as they cover most hardware such as VCRs, DVDs, the TV, and the Bose. I rarely have to bother with any other remote. This is a must-have for my wife as she doesn't want multiple remotes to watch TV.Can't beat the picture. For those out there contemplating whether it's worth the extra $ to buy the 92U model, it is. The motion is better, the colors are richer, and there are zero banding issues.", "Date": "July 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "Amazing picture but sound...", "Author": "Akihito Araki \"rb26dett2\"", "ReviewID": "R33F8EQFC2IK6P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good:- Picture looks amazing when true 1080p contents are played- Picture still looks amazing with 1080i upscaled DVD (HDMI)- One of the least annoying LCD monitor for the fast motion- I see no banding- Very flexible inputs (8 total including TV tuner)- Very easy to change settingNot so good:- Sounds horrible (original speaker system and built in amp are practically useless)- Analog station looks annoyingly fuzzy (no way to overcome this yet?)- Less expensive or old DVD player looks annoyingly fuzzy (over S-video or component)- Color reproduction is somewhat unnaturalI take 1 star off because sound quality is totally unacceptable for me. There is no bass and no clean treble. The mid range sounds so distorted with or without surround activated.

The thing I was worried about most was how well the T.V. would handle fast moving shots like sports.  It does it perfectly.  My older, 32\", Sony Bravia XBR, has little boxes that appear occasionally on fast moving shots, and I have seen several other brands do this as well.  I am happy to say that after 10 days of viewing this new set, I haven't seen any boxes.  The other thing I was worried about was how well regular T.V. (non HD shows) would look.  Some sets can make them look really bad.  Not so with this Sharp.  It makes them look so good that if the TV is in one of its stretch modes, my wife and I frequently have a hard time telling if the program is in HD or not.  Lots of shows look that good.", "Date": "October 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Lots of nice features, couple big issues...", "Author": "B. Porter", "ReviewID": "RO6J0IULX25S5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was persuaded to buy this set instead of the new Samsung 52\" by a very knowledgeable sales-person who pointed out this technology (4ms response time, 5 stage backlight) really set the standard for LCD technology.I suspect he was right, but once in my living room, these were difficult to notice.  Here's what I did notice...Good:- The performance coming out of my standard Tivo was terrific.  The \"S Stretch\" mode does a great job using the whole screen but not making people look abnormally wide.  The MPEG compression artifacts largely disappeared and the noise level was quite low.- The screen lights up instantly when you press the power button.- The menus are intuitive.- You can customize the color scheme for each Input individually.- When using DVI, the on-screen-display shows what mode it is in (720p, etc) in thetop right which is very helpful.- You can skip back and forth with your previous input mode easily.Bad:- The speakers are truly awful.  For a $3-3.5K device, the speakers are about like a $15 clock radio.  TV shows with even a bit of deep base caused incredible sound distortion at very low volume.  I'm not an audiophile and I don't consider these speakers acceptable in any way.- If the brightness is too high, banding is noticeable.  Tuned appropriately, I don't think it should be, but you may trade some amount of banding for detail in the blacks.- In 720p hooked to my Comcast Motorola cable box, I'm seeing static noise patterns for non-HD content at the top of the picture.  I get a bright line along the right side of the picture.  And even in HD mode I get a purple line across the bottom of the screen.  Seems like the set is displaying all the data it is getting and not stripping out the signal headers.  You can only change the hpos and vpos of the image, not the stretch.  There may be more settings I can play with on the Cable Box to make this work out.- The case plastic is actually a very dark gray, not black, which depending on your room and stylistic preferences can make the set look a little bit cheap sitting in your living room.- Out-of-the-box the colors all seem washed out.  The Tivo green menu screen was trending toward gray.  With some tweaking (particularly reducing brightness level) I was able to improve this.Conclusion:This is a very good LCD.  The noise management for low-res content is impressive.  That said, I'm going to return it as the speaker issue is intolerable.  It is also more expensive than the Samsung 52\" without a clearly visible benefit.(I did return this product and purchased the 52\" Samsung.  I love it.

Putting my videophile hat on, in rare circumstance I can spot the \"banding\" this set is famous for, which reminds me a bit of seeing the northern lights in a dark sky.

A little too big for my 14 feet viewing distance, but it's gorgeous!  Black is very deep, Not much artifacts with fast action scene.  Lots of inputs (except there is only 1 S-Video input).  I wish there are 2 RF inputs and PIP/split screen.  The little speakers sitting at the bottom of the screen sounds reasonable for TV.  You wouldn't use them to watch movies anyway.  The remote is a little bulky in my opinion, but favorite channels buttons are awesome (4 of them for you to cycle thru 16 channels).  The only complaint I really have is that the TV screen dims a little when you switch channels.  Then the brightness returns to normal (I turned the OPC off already).  It's a little annoying, but doesn't affect the picture quality at all.Electronics Express rocks!  They never emailed me when the TV was shipped.  Within 4 business days of ordering, the shipping company (Eagles) called me to schedule a delivering date and time.  They came @ 1pm sharp and dropped off the TV.

Great picture and nice ergonomics with decent speakers.  But one serious flaw remains.  BANDING!  This is my third set from Sharp after the last two were replaced.  Each set had a different degree of banding than the rest.Banding is particularly noticeable in TV content that has a lot of camera movement against a neutral background (shows like ER, Boston Legal, CSI all accentuate this defect considerably).  You'll typically see shaded bars running horizontally across the screen.  Some sets even experience vertical banding as well.I had a different model Sharp before and it was flawless.  These issues began plaguing Sharp models after they switched their manufacturing plant to a new facility.  I'm not too sure if Sharp has entirely remedied this problem on newer sets with higher serial numbers, but based on the newsgroups I've visited, even new sets have this phenomena.I am going to opt for a refund direct from Sharp since it appears they are honoring such requests from buyers that demand it.  For me, the issue of banding was too distracting and destroyed the experience of enjoying this set.  The picture is otherwise amazing.  I'm going to seriously consider the Sony XBR sets.

I have yet to be over at somebody's house and think, \"wow, that TV looks better than mine.\"  And that's saying a lot, because I'm the guy that friends, neighbors and relatives ask for home theatre advice.I bought Sharp on the advice of a master repairman who told me that Sharp has never delved into plasma TVs.  All their research & development $$$ has been devoted to LCD.  And he, a guy who repairs all manner of TV, projector & audio equipment, said Sharp is very easy to deal with regarding warranty issues and parts availablity.The colors are sharp, the motion does not blur, and I haven't seen any banding.  I have an upscaling DVD and it looks excellent, especially with a well-shot movie like \"Children of Men\".  Still waiting for the perfect Blu-ray player to come out, but I have borrowed one and it looked noticeably better.Only two small cons (not big enough to reduce this to a 4* review):1) The DVI-I input only accepts up to a 1600x1200 analog resolution.  This means if your laptop has a VGA output, like mine, and you set it to 1920x1080, the TV can't display it.  However, using the same input's digital side, with my wife's laptop that has a DVI output, I can send the TV its native resolution with no problem.  And wow, does that look crisp.2)  There is not a direct access button to any input.  To switch inputs you have to scroll through them or select from a list.  This makes it impossible to program a macro thoroughly on my receiver's universal remote.All in all, I'd buy this one again.  As a matter of fact, I am suggesting it to a relative who wants to move up from her rear-projection TV this month.Update 1/19/11:  Still looks as good as the day I got it.
