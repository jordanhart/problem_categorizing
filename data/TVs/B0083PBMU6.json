I played with it for an hour--tried calling Amazon service which I discovered amounted to me pressing \"call now\" only to get robo-called and put on hold... Not a good purchase experience from Magnavox or Amazon. Requested the return forms within 2 hours of opening it.  Will buy electronics elsewhere.", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice TV/DVD combo", "Author": "Matthew", "ReviewID": "R3SU5LHQKGQRAO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recieved this TV as a gift after using a 15 inch TV for a while.  The TV is the perfect size for me and it's great that it has a built in DVD player.  The sound and picture seem to be of a good quality but the only thing I wish it did was tilt.  This particular model does not tilt - only the 19 and 22 inch TV.  But overall, a nice TV.", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "OK for me", "Author": "Butterfly \"Butterfly\"", "ReviewID": "R2MAVEV37CZ0N6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This little TV works okay, but the speakers do not amplify enough and I am not hard of hearing.
