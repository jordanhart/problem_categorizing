{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great LCD HDTV and an outstanding value", "Author": "Frank Y.", "ReviewID": "R1JX6UCPXEWPON", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got it for $1,700 shipped vs. $1,900-$2,300 sold elsewhere.  Great high definition picture and very good standard definition.  The best viewing angle of any LCD screen that I've seen.  Sound quality is atypical, with good simulated bass.  Built-in virtual surround sound eliminates the need for a home theatre system except for audiophiles.  Like most LCD, it does not do black color well.  Human skin tone looks cartoonish at closeup, a negative for this set.  There is no blur motion, even with NASCAR.  The on-screen menu is very easy to navigate, so no need to read the manual on the CD.  Lots of connectivity options on the back and a few jacks on the side for camcorder (no HiDef.)  Auto-sizing is always correct on screen size - unlike some other HDTVs that sometimes get it wrong.  There is a green/red status LED so that I know whether the TV is actually on or in standby mode (less than 1W with EnergyStar.)  The set is heavy at 110 pounds, but that also helps deter theft I reckon.  The shining and narrow black frame is absolutely beautiful.  Overall, I highly recommend this 52\" monster.", "Date": "July 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Sweet upgrade HDTV", "Author": "M. Tillery", "ReviewID": "ROCNFYNGHD9L8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've wanting to dive into HD TVs for quite some time now.  I ordered this beautiful, glossy, thin behemoth.  I ordered the TV for only $1300 versus where I originally found it watching HSN selling for $2300.  The product was ordered through Tiger Direct and I received the TV within one week.  The packing stated the weight was 112 lbs.  My tiny girlfriend and I were able to carry it around with ease though.  No dead pixels or physical damage to the TV what so ever.  I hooked up the HD cable, XBOX 360, and my surround sound system.  I played Gears of War 2 & Halo 3 immediately.  The colors were simply amazing except for the range of black.  There was no blur during 10 hours of straight playtime.  The sound wasn't bad when I unhooked my surround sound for TV shows, but during the play of XBOX there was a difference not too big though.  There are plenty of jacks on this TV and I've even hooked up my laptop to the TV with no problems at all.  I can even sit away from the TV with a wireless mouse/keyboard linked to my laptop and can still read websites just fine.  All in all I'm very happy with this purchase.  Thank-You LG & Amazon", "Date": "February 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "The Best TV Ever!!!", "Author": "Amanda Highsmith \"ajsartwork\"", "ReviewID": "R3KLI0I52IJKNF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband and I have owned  alot of different TV's and I tell you what, this is the best TV ever.. the quality of the picture is amazing... crystal clear.. the features are increadable..

There is one small negative, which is so minor only the audiophiles will even notice it, but the sound quality is lacking in the low frequencies.  I have it working with a surround sound systems so it doesn't matter to me. However, that's a characteristic of the product, not Amazon or the company I bought the TV from.  They did just great.", "Date": "December 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "best buy out there", "Author": "Harold J.

Sanders \"RFguy\"", "ReviewID": "R2C0BT7MIOKVL4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This TV has connectivity issues. First there is only 1 RF input. So you cannot have cable and antenna connected to it at the same time. There are 3 HDMI inputs but they share a single audio input. The on-screen program info for OTA digital TV is limited to program title and length. Even cheap converter boxes give a program description. Finally after 1 year a vertical red line appeared on the screen from top to bottom about 1/3 the way across the screen.
