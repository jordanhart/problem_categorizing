{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Recommend the ET5 Series for Best-In-Class Picture, 3D and IPTV", "Author": "\"D\"", "ReviewID": "R1TZ3MZ2IOYNPZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV for a very bright room with lots of sunlight, as this IPS LED seemed brighter than any plasma display, and without the energy draw or heat of a plasma. I'm exceptionally happy with this great TV on many levels.Highlights of why I like this television:I have seen the future and it's clearly LED.  The picture quality of this LED TV is top-notch. The brightness and the colors are fantastic, showing a truly stunning picture with an extremely wide viewing angle from the sides that really is a hair away from 180\u00b0. It's also very bright, noticeably brighter than a plasma TV.  While it's not quite as good at displaying pure black and picture uniformity in comparison to high-end videophile plasmas that costs thousands more, it's really not far off. It's the best I've seen from an LCD/LED set and as good or better than mainstream plasmas.From reading Internet forums, I appear to be the one person on the planet who prefers motion interpolation, which Panasonic calls \"Motion Picture Setting\" and this TV allows four settings: Off/Weak/Medium/Strong. Basically, I prefer life-like video, with natural motion that feels like I am watching in-person on a stage or set rather than film or video, and \"Strong\" pretty much delivers that. 1080p HD sources look like I'm watching a play with the action unfolding live in front of me. For sports, the experience is unrivaled and truly pulls you into the action. Or, if you hate this so-called \"Soap Opera Effect\" and prefer traditional film/video movement, then you can turn this feature off. And if you need very fast response, there's also a Game mode.I was completely unprepared for being blown away by this TV's 3D picture. I've played with 3D TV before, but somehow other TVs with bulky electro-mechanical active shutter 3D glasses always let me down due to the flicker, which distracted me from enjoying the 3D effect. I tried an LG passive 3D TV last year, and the effect was \"dulled\" compared to active 3D TV so I wrote off the whole 3D-at-home thing as immature technology.  Not any more.  The state-of-the-art has apparently changed in one year. This TV is the best of both worlds (active-like effect/passive-like ease and no flicker) and comes with four pairs of lightweight passive polarized 3D theater glasses (TY-EP3D10), and frankly, the effect is amazing with none of the flicker of active glasses. I watched several Blu-ray 3D movies along with my cable company's 3D channels and 3D VOD. All I can say is... wow. It's not only very watchable, it's incredible. Movies are flat-out fun. Sports on ESPN 3D are amazing. Interestingly, the TV has a 2D-3D conversion function which is really quite good; although it lacks the deep depth of native 3D content, whatever magic it uses to turn 2D into 3D is remarkably effective. I had no idea passive 3D TV could be this good.The TV has a good array of inputs: 4 HDMI 1.4 ports with ARC, 2 USB 2.0 ports, 1 set of component (Y/Pb/Pr) or composite video & analog stereo audio RCA connectors (via included proprietary adapter), 1 PC VGA connector, 1 coax RF port, 1 SDXC card slot, and 1 Fast Ethernet jack. WiFi is built-in, with no dongle required, and therefore does not take up a USB port. The TV's black stand and black/clear frame are attractive, making it look stylish in my living room. And the glossy black remote is very nice, with illuminated buttons.Internet TV is via Panasonic's smart TV system called VIERA Connect. It's simple, and has applications included for subscription services like Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, Hulu Plus, MLB.TV and others. I stream videos from Amazon Prime and it works great with high quality HD. Another standout is the Skype app, which requires the optional TY-CC20W camera with inbound calls integrated into the watching experience. Audio and video Skype calls can be received or dismissed while watching something else, and the overall Skype experience is simple and straightforward with very high quality video calls. Outbound calls require going into VIERA Connect, and then launching Skype. Perhaps initiating an outbound call while watching other content could also be similarly better integrated in the future with fewer button presses?Sound is very good for a flat screen TV, and is certainly more than I was expecting. Don't expect miracles, the integrated speakers are small and on the bottom of the frame facing down, and compared with an external sound bar or home theater system they're missing bass and some midrange. But, for a panel TV, the sound is really very good.Quibbles, as overall it's still an outstanding TV:The digital audio out (TOSLINK optical) doesn't pass through everything, as surround sound (DD/DTS) does not get passed from HDMI connections (silence or static instead) and audio from Skype is not passed at all (probably for echo-cancellation reasons). In both cases the TV speakers still work if enabled.The VIERA Remote App on iOS slow and clunky, although I suppose it's nice to have it as an option. It makes the iPhone vibrate with every remote button press. I found it not a particularly useful gadget compared to the normal infrared remote.By default, the TV shows sponsored banner ads upon startup (VIERA Connect Banner) and in the VIERA Connect app selection screen. I suppose this pervasive advertising is the future of digital media, but it seems unnecessarily intrusive on your own TV as it's turning on. You can disable the startup advertisement, and move the VIERA Connect ad app to another app page with seldom-used applications. However, if you disable the startup banner ad, and you try to use IPTV in the first 15 seconds or so after turning the TV on, you get an error message saying the TV needs an Internet connection.The DLNA Media Player isn't quite full-featured enough to be the primary home network media player for me, even though its user interface is fast and simple. The first major flaw is that while it plays many media formats, such as MKV/H.264, it doesn't support some exceptionally common media formats like AVI files (\"Cannot read file\"). What is perplexing is the FAQ on the Panasonic web site says certain AVI files are supported. It may not be that AVI is the actual problem, but any media in any container encoded with MPEG-4 Visual such as DivX/Xvid/Nero Direct/3ivx/QuickTime 6 video codecs (\"Cannot read file\") and that just happens to be the most common format for AVI video. Also, media encoded with a DTS audio codec plays without any audio (\"Audio format not supported\"); it would have been nice if digital audio would at least be passed unmodified through to the digital audio out port. Other formats trip it up as well.  I tried a media file that contained two audio tracks (one in German, the second in English) and while the menu appeared like one could choose which track plays, it only displayed and played the first track. The second major flaw is that it immediately begins playing the highlighted video in a preview window as you move up and down your list of media, including its audio, which is not only annoying but also places a burden on the media server if the media needs transcoding. This might be the case, for example, if you configure your DLNA Media Server to transcode AVI/MPEG-4/DTS files in order to even have them play at all with this TV's media player.The only complete miss on this TV: I found the web browser pure misery to use with the included infrared remote. While I could fumble through navigation using the VIERA Remote App from my iPhone, I couldn't get any site with video to work. It's one of the worst overall web browsing experiences I've ever encountered. In my opinion, the web browser is essentially unusable unless used as an instrument of torture. In such cases, I suspect it would be effective in extracting information from the most hardened target.  (\"I'll talk, just make it stop!\")But, the issues are minor compared to the positives: the best-in-class plasma-beating picture, 3D quality and great IPTV functionality. Overall, this is a great TV.", "Date": "July 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "a lot to like, but....", "Author": "JoshJosh", "ReviewID": "R1O64KJDUEGI6M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I picked this TV to replace an older Samsung LCD; my primary uses are games, sports, and the occasional movie. I used it for 2 weeks steadily.This TV was easy to set up - it found my Wi-Fi network quickly and offered a firmware update which installed without hassle. The remote is easy to use and the menus are responsive. The settings are, unfortunately, few, as it seems to lack advanced picture controls (white balance and the like). However, working with what I had, I used the Disney WOW Blu-Ray to calibrate. The end results turned out to be very similar to \"custom mode.\"The picture quality was good. Colors are great and I found motion handling to be very good. I didn't notice any \"soap opera effect\" - motion looked good to me. The one issue is that the default black setting (\"Dark\") crushed like crazy - no details could be found in dark scenes, and it was impossible to calibrate games (you know - \"move the cursor until you barely see the logo\"). Changing it to \"light\" resolved the issue, though.I don't have much to say on sound quality - it seemed loud and clear, but lacking \"punch.\" I use a cheap Sony sound bar, and the sound on the TV definitely wasn't even close to that. Thankfully, the TV has an optical out so setup was not a hassle. I plugged in my cable box, PS3, and 360 to the TV through HDMI and routed the optical cord to the sound bar.This is my first 3D TV so I was eager to try out the 3D. Panasonic thankfully includes four glasses, which were a good side and fit comfortably even over my regular glasses. I am not well-versed on the difference between passive and active sets but this looked good. Some games looked great (Killzone 3, Super Stardust), some looked muddy and undetailed (Gears 3, Resistance 3). The TV even has a weird 2D-to-3D mode which can turn regular content into 3D. I tried it with a basketball game and it wasn't bad, though I wouldn't use it that much.Game support was just fine. With game mode turned off, games were pretty choppy and tore a lot, but with game mode on, it was smooth and responsive. I don't have a way to accurately measure lag but it seemed very good to me - 1-2 frames at most. The games I played looked good and Street Fighter was responsive - no complaints at all there.So. Good gaming, good picture, good 3D. Everything's great, right? Unfortunately not. The big problem with my set was banding, which is basically issues with uniformity in the backlight. The light is not distributed evenly which causes vertical bands to show up. Make no mistake - this is noticeable in certain content, and it detracts from the experience. Soccer matches and games with bright vistas (think Crysis or something like that) look dingy. It's gross, and unfortunately a dealbreaker. The set was returned.I'm not happy about it, but this is an inevitability when margins are so tight and competition is so fierce. I mean, most people probably won't notice it, but I do. It's quite possibly that I just got a bad panel, but it's possible I didn't. In my research, this appears to be a common issue with all LEDs, from all manufacturers. So just be careful when you consider this or any other TV.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent bargain LED 3D TV!", "Author": "Pablo Ortega", "ReviewID": "RYM7HJUCNPHW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After finding out about this TV and making my research, I was hooked.

It is the ET5 series from Panasonic.  This series features passive 3D (not of great interest to me) and some of the best Smart TV functional (of great interest to me) functionality of all TVs in the price range.Let's start with the screen: Perfect size for our living space of roughly 10-15' from screen.  It has great color and life like tones.  I popped it into passive mode, just to check out some 3D action and I think it flowed very nice.  I have yet to see any ghosting or issues with movement.  I chose LED over Plasma, as Plasma tends to have more glare and our living space is bright.I was most interested in the Smart functions.  I was looking for a TV that would allow for a QWERTY keyboard to make searching for movies and browsing the net quick.  However, with the exception of a few Panasonics from 2011, there were few TVs that have a QWERTY keyboard.  With the exception of a few high end models, there was nothing that fit the bill.  Until I found the ET5 series.It not only has a free app from Panasonic (this TV is compatible), but it also allows you to use the keyboard on your iphone/ipad/android to type in things.  ADDITIONALLY, (Panasonic does not advertise it very well and Best Buy sales guys are clueless), but you can use some USB wireless keyboard devices as an input device.What makes it stand out:1.  Panasonic Viera remote compatible with Iphone/Ipad/Android control2.  Can use 3rd party mini wireless keyboards3.  Easy wifi or ethernet connectivity4.  Bright, vivid screen5.  Excellent value for the priceWhat could be better:1.  It only has 2 USB ports (could be expanded?)2.  The basic remote it comes with really is generic.  I need a remote that can learn functions (so as to replace existing remotes) and has a keyboard for easy entry.Hope this helps!", "Date": "May 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just Slightly ahead of our time...", "Author": "Christopher C. Stearman \"\"It is not our t...", "ReviewID": "R2WGFXX2GNA94L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This television is easily one of the best values per dollar currently available.  After years of research to the point where I was exhausted by the whole thing, this is what I selected.  It isn't purrfect (weight of remote is wrong in your hand and position of buttons makes it a two-hander, FB/Twitter overlay needs adjustments, and I am seriously annoyed that ALL panel tvs now require an adapter to convert digital sound back to analog for use with our OLD stereo equipment).  I was surprised to discover that the rca-input jacks for component/composite are one-in-the-same, (shared: meaning you get one or the other but not both, and they connect to an (included)ADAPTER plug, verses direct connect to the set) but other than that this set is TOP SHELF.  I highly recommend it.There is some cornfusion regarding some of it's specifications.  It's a 360 refresh rate, not a 120.  This is accomplished through a mixture of backlight led scanning and refresh rate scanning.  The 3D on it is passive, BUT:  it has a full menu system for allowing conversion of 2D INTO 3D for your enjoyment.  The 3D depth has varying adjustment in it's aspect depending upon the source material.  (if it is MADE for 3D obviously it's going to have a more complete and pronounced effect).  I like the color, size shape, fit and finish of the set.  The ability to get to where I want to go within the menus is a little challenging at times, because it's set up for sequential access instead of random access.  Sometimes (for me personally) this can be a deal breaker, but given the incredible amount they have squeezed into this set in terms of features and performance, I'll let it slide.  What this means is, in order to get to some functions I must go through a series of menus to get to them, rather than going directly to where I want to go.All in all, Panasonic has outdone themselves with this set/price point.  I am VERY pleased, and have opted to use it's companion blu-ray player as well.  Excellent product, performance, and a no-brainer for value.  If you don't know what to get, and you want something good, with enough flexibility to deal with most of what anyone might encounter in system component matching:  This is the set you want.Update:  After tinkering and exploring I have discovered that you can run your panasonic blu-ray player as permanent audio for the set.  You just use the remote for the blu-ray player and connect the old style audio jacks from the blu-ray player to the old audio receiver and you have no need for a digital to analog conversion chipset.  I very much would have liked to see panasonic add a chip in there to have made both remotes fully redundant to this end with some sort of indicator letting the driver know that they are accessing viera functions on board the blu-ray verses the SAME functions that are available on board of the television, but they didn't.  If they' been SMART, they'd have allowed you to stack the user designable menu options from both the companion panasonic blu-ray player AND the television, but to my knowledge it is either/or.  Overall I have been very pleased with my new set, and you know that you are well pleased when it comes to being anywhere else and not even bothering to be looking at other peoples tech.

I had brought the LG55LM6700 but sent it back due to lackluster picture resolution and inability to adjust the anti-judder or \"smoothing effect\". I know Panasonic has a great reputation for plasmas so I wasn't sure about their LEDs, but after seeing this in a showroom and reading reviews I decided to give it a try. I must say that I've been more than pleased with the TV.The picture is excellent on network HDTV and picks up sports pretty good. It's still not as good as a plasma for sports but most LEDs aren't except the 240hz. It is stunning with Blu-ray movies! Excellent picture quality that does not need much calibration at all. NOTE: The anti-judder effect is very prominent on this set but has 4 settings: strong, medium, weak, and off. I toggle between medium and weak and it suits me very well.The wireless set-up is quick and easy and the internet applications are enough for me. I have only used netflix so far but it streams almost HD quality as long as you have the proper bandwidth.

When comparing the features on this TV to a similar Samsung you will pay $300-$400 more. I wasn't sure what to expect with this TV and honestly I was ready to dislike it from the start. Now that I've been using mine for about a month I feel I can give a solid review. Sure, this TV is not top of the line, but it has some features you will find on much higher priced sets.Pros- This TV is thin! You can hang it on the wall and it looks like a picture frame on the wall. All the connections are strategically placed that make doing just this possible!- Built in WiFi! I've always hated the idea of having to run a network cable to where I have my TV. It just isn't practical. My PS3 and Xbox are wireless so that's how I've compensated over the past few years. Having the ability to stream without an external source directly from Netfilx or Amazon has made this TV really handy.- The passive 3D has been amazing! I thought I really wanted a TV with active 3D, but the wider viewing angle of the passive 3D and not having to worry about battery powered glasses was a big selling point for me to go passive. Sure the TV snobs will tell you that you are not seeing each frame in Full 1080P with the passive, but we've gotten to the point where the human eye can't even tell so I'm not paying more for something I wouldn't even notice! The 2D to 3D feature is pretty cool too, but the way I'd describe that is that instead of the picture coming out at you, the TV seems to be like a window that you are looking into. The true 3D does come right out of the set at you and I can't believe there isn't more 3D content for how amazing it is to have in your home. The nice thing about the passive 3D is that you just take home your glasses from the latest 3D movie in the theater and they work with your set!- The sound has been impressive. Sure it's not amazing, but I have heard much worse from stock TV speakers. I did hook mine up to surround sound but still use the TV speakers 80% of the time and they have done just fine.Cons:- I'm not sure but I believe this TV only has a single core processor. It's most obvious when searching through the smart TV menus. It just seems like the TV needs more processing power to truly be used as a smart TV that could replace your computer for surfing the web. I've added a wireless logitech keyboard and it has made the smart TV functions so much easier to use! Trying to key in a basic internet search with the stock remote is just down right painful!- Soap Opera Effect (SOE). I've heard many people talk about SOE and Panasonic TVs and didn't understand until I've seen it regularly. It's hard to explain, but some TV shows like Dramas actually look more realistic then they are probably meant to, so they look a lot like the camera movements you would see watching a soap opera. While I've listed this as a Con, it's actually started to grow on me.- No built in camera. The TV has Skype as one of the apps, but without an external camera you can't even use it to make calls. The camera is required to use the app which I don't fully understand. I can make skype calls on my computer without turning the camera on, why can't I do the same on my TV?- The power indicator light is in a horrible location. It is a bright red LED right in the center on the bottom. In a dark room it is so obvious, I don't know why they placed this where they did, but I have noticed I've started blocking it out. At first it was a major annoyance and I almost covered it up with a small piece of tape!I don't think you can find a TV with more features for this price and I am extremely happy with my purchase. I would consider a Panasonic in the future if I am ever looking to upgrade again.Update 11/24/12It truly is a 120 HZ refresh rate set and they get to 360 HZ by playing with the backlighting from what I understand.  In comparing to other sets I would compare this to other 120 HZ sets.  I am not aware how many bits the panel is and I have tried to ind this info without any luck.  I personally have had zero issue with any edge light bleeding.  The edge of my set is perfectly uniform and with the room dark and a dark scene there is no bleed through.  I honestly didn't want to like this set as my fianc\u00e9e picked it as an engagement gift for me and I was looking at samsungs that cost much more.  5 months later we still both love the set and the only thing I wish is that we would have gone bigger than the 42\".  We were even considering upgrading to the 55\" when it was in the Black Friday deal a couple nights ago but I didn't pull the trigger.

Sound is a lacking.  I will end up buying a sound bar to go along with this.We use Netflix 80% of the time and one thing that is VERY annoying is black flashing while watching any content.  It may occur a few times a minute or once every 30 minutes.  It varies.  From research I've done this happens when the video streaming mode changes.I've done a lot of research on the issue and it seems to occur with other Samsung Smart TV's also and a number of different blu-ray players.  Some people say it is due to Netflix's poor servers in the area.  All I know is I stream Netflix fine on 6 other devices without the issue. I believe it be both Panasonics problem and possibly Netflix's but Panasonic is at least in part responsible due to it being fine on other devices.  Other content providers such as VUDU work fine.  I have streamed 1080p HDX with VUDU and it's fine so it's not my internet or the TV itself.This may possibly be a deal breaker.  If I wanted a TV that I needed to attach a ROKU or some other device to I would have bought something cheaper and not SMART.  I have read that not all people have the Netflix issue so it may not occur if using different Netflix servers I'm not sure.  But if you are buying this for Netflix and it's important to you, you should be aware.  Go ahead and google \"netflix flashing black\" and you will see the threads out there.Besides that.  Like I said the picture is good although I do see a cloudy flashlight areas in various places when on a solid dark screen.  I can notice those areas lighter on regular pictures if I look hard enough.  I've read with most LED TVs the uniformity isn't great.  Coming from a plasma this is very annoying.  I've had one TV that came damaged that I recently replaced and the uniformity on this one is actually much worse.  I'll be having Panasonic come out and look at it to see what the options are.The 2d-3d is also lacking as someone else mentioned.  I have tried that and I have tried actual 3d demos on VUDU.  THe difference is night and day.  I can tell the difference between 2d and 2d -> 3d content but it's not worth watching it that way IMHO.I got a great deal on this TV and I'm undecided what to do from here regarding the Netflix issue.  It is definitely a shame as I think if the flashing didn't occur I would be pretty happy with it.++++ UPDATE ++++Panasonic got back to me and admitted they are aware of the Netflix issue and said they are actively working on a fix.  Not ETA though. I have a Panasonic plasma also and they have always provided good support.One other thing now that I think about it the viewing angles aren't nearly as good as a plasma (expected) but are better than my last LCD it replaced.", "Date": "July 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worthy Upgrade!", "Author": "JPL \"massman\"", "ReviewID": "R2QPLYA1XCI2RV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay, so first off, I originally saw this T.V. at Best Buy and was impressed by the clarity of the picture quality and the features.  I was looking to upgrade from a four year old 47\" non-3D, non-LED Vizio LCD which has served me well.  Technology has changed and I was looking for something bigger.  Went to the Amazon showroom at Best Buy and the price at Best Buy was $1399 + tax.  Looked on Amazon and the price was $1299.00 with free shipping.  $100 bucks + tax is a big deal to me.  Downside was that it would take a week to get it delivered from Amazon, so I bought the unit at BB and figured I'd sacrifice the price difference to get the unit earlier (instant gratification demon bites again).  Got the unit home, set everything up, and noticed some significant light bleed from the bottom left and bottom right corners of the unit.  I remembered a reviewer posting pics on Amazon of the light bleed on his unit so decided to go back and compare his with mine.  Well, when I looked this unit up on Amazon again, the price had dropped to $1098 w/free shipping.  $300 difference + tax is a big deal so decided I would order on Amazon, and take the one I bought at BB back.  Also figured maybe the unit from Amazon wouldn't have such pronounced bleeding from the corners.  Now, I see this unit is  up to $1335 on Amazon - so, if you are considering this unit, the price fluctuates so you may want to keep an eye on that.Set up delivery via online delivery option on Amazon.  Selected a Friday delivery between 3-5 p.m.  Well, the day before scheduled delivery, I get an email from the shipping company informing me that I had to reschedule delivery.  I call the company and they inform me that 1) they do not deliver \"that late in the day\" and 2) they work delivery within 4 hour windows, not 2.  Needless to say, I was not pleased as I had made arrangements to get off work early for the 3-5 p.m delivery.  So I had to choose another delivery the same day between 9-1.  I contacted Amazon customer service, relayed my displeasure, and they profusely apologized and wanted to make things right.  They offered to deduct what the cost of shipping would have cost me, which was $67.  So, for a bit of inconvenience, ended up getting the unit for a bit over $1K.  Couldn't be more pleased with Amazon customer service.Speaking of being pleased, I couldn't be more pleased with this unit.  I'm not a videophile by any means, but do enjoy a clear and vibrant picture.  Overall, it was a terrific purchase.  The unit I recieved from Amazon has none of the light bleeding the unit from Best Buy had.  The picture clarity out of the box is pretty spot-on, once I made some adjustments it was absolutely outstanding.  Avatar on 3D will blow you away. Passive 3D glasses are nice and light.  The screen is not matte like my previous 47\" vizio, but isn't quite as obnoxious as plasma.  I'll trade the minimal amount of glare on this unit for the picture quality it provides.  I have the unit connected via ethernet cable for internet content.  No issues - the interface for internet apps is smooth and responsive and more often than not I max out on the HD signal while streaming.  I did test out the wi-fi and had a strong connection with minimal to no lag while streaming Netflix, HULU, and Amazon VOD.I was bouncing back and forth at first between this and a similiar vizio unit, as well as the LG 6200.  The visio had a more advanced blutooth remote, but looked a bit thicker from the front (larger bezel) and was a bit more expensive than what I paid for this.  Also, I have heard from several sources that Vizio's customer service leaves much to be desired (although fortunatley I have owned 3 vizios and have never had to deal with customer service issues).  My friend has the LG, but cannot turn off the true motion feature, so all of his content has the \"soap opera effect.\"  With this unit, you have your choice of four motion settings:  Off, Weak, Normal, Strong.  I leave mine on the weak setting.I do wish it had a qwerty remote like some of the vizios, but there is a smartphone app that takes some of the pain away, although the keyboard function on the app does not work with Netflix, HULU, Amazon VOD, so inputting characters for searching is still a bit clunky.  The stand this unit comes with is barely adequate and not very stable - I opted out of the stand and mounted on the wall.  Can't comment on the speaker quality, I have it connected to a 7.1 set-up and all is good.For the current price of this unit on Amazon, this unit is a competitive front-runner.

The picture is fantastic after tweaking the picture settings! The blacks are great for an LED lit tv and not much of a flashight effect that you get with some LED tvs. The sound is not bad at all as long as you max out the bass (+15) and turn bass boost on. I also have a sound bar and use that most of the time but can't complain about the sound of the TV. I have xbox 360 hooked up to the TV and see no issue when gaming. Also the 3D on this TV is amazing! I bought Titanic 3D and was blown away! This is a progressive 3D TV not active 3D like all the plasmas and most LCD tvs. Progressive 3D is the only way to go. I have a friend with a 63\" Samsung plasma with active 3d and I can't stand it. Active 3D flickers to much, you have to be right in front of the TV and the glasses are very expensive.  Now the reason why I only give three stars is because I'm on my second set. First one had a strange dark spot on the bottom left and white looked purple in that area. I exchanged that and got my new one in today. At first all looked great on my new one but I just noticed a dead pixel in the top middle right of the picture. Its hard to notice but it bugs me that I know its there and can see it if I look hard on bright objects. I don't no if I will keep this second set or not. The picture is fantastic but I just wish it didn't have that one dead pixel. Dead or stuck pixels are a chance you take with all LCD TVs. Amazon has been great with the exchanges and they are great to work with! If you get a good one there is no other LCD LED tv on the market that I can see being any better for image quality. Don't go out and get a 3k tv. This one does it all for a great price! Yes you may get a bad panel but that is the case with all LCD tvs. Oh and just to let you all know there are no LED tvs on the market yet. These tvs are LDC. People think oh LED is better then LCD. Guess what all the LED tvs are actually LCD tvs just with LED lighting. The next technology will be OLED tvs. Those will be actual LED but won't be in a good price range for about five years. I would take this tv over a plasma any day.Settings that I think are great for this TV.Back Light 20%Contrast 90%Brightness 35%Color 40-45Color temp normalAI picture onColor mgmt offCATS offVideo NR offupdate......I ended up calling Amazon today and will be exchanging this one for another.

Excellent picture quality of the box and provides nice adjustment features.2. Passive 3D works great and the 2D to 3D feature works a lot better than I expected.3. Panasonic Viera Connect has lots of apps (and growing) and the apps work very well.4. DLNA works but is limited (see below).5. Plays various file extensions on the USB drive.6. Built-in wifi and apps eliminate the need to buy external hardware (Google TV, Apple TV). You may still buy one for additional features, but that is different.7. Smartphone apps to interact with your TV.CONS:1. Sound quality is OK. Unfortunately, this seems to be true for most HDTVs around - mediocre audio quality. I will say that it is good for most purposes, but if you are an audiophile, you will want external speakers.2. If you are using DLNA, it plays few file formats. Most popular file formats (e.g., AVI, MKV) are not directly supported unless you have a media server. Using a media server (e.g., Serviio, Mezzmo) is an option but then you have to transcode almost all files, which introduces additional delays.3. Even on the USB, the file format supported is limited (although much broader than on DLNA). Again, AVI files are not supported.4.

Here's why.The Picture:The picture was gorgeous, right out of the box. We had no need to tweak the default settings. The quality of the picture is truly astonishing.We may be part of that fringe group of viewers who love the SOE, \"soap opera effect.\" We like our TV picture to be as lifelike and \"live\" as possible, so to watch a movie that appears like live TV is a treat. We see no reason to degrade the image so it looks like a movie. If my wife is watching TV I have to ask her if it is a movie or live because I can't tell by just looking at the screen.  Maybe SOE should be renamed LTVE, Live TV Effect. Love that LTVE effect!3D:The 3D is excellent. 3D really does add to the enjoyment of, well, anything. If you are wondering if 3D is worth the additional cost, the answer is YES. Provided you have a source for 3D programming.3D Glasses:The four included 3D glasses are well made. They are a different shape from the usual 3D glasses, which makes them more comfortable for prolong use, even over the eyeglasses which we both wear.The Remote:The remote is a good size, well-balanced with buttons intelligently sized and placed. For example, the mute button is just above the volume control buttons. The buttons are backlit for five seconds when a light button is pressed.The controls are easy and natural. The set is well designed ergonomically.One major annoyance in the Vizio TV was that you had to manually tell the TV that the image was in 3D, then tell it which type of 3D, then say yes, you really do want to view it in 3D before it would present the image in 3D. This Panasonic is smart enough to figure out the type of image, 3D or 2D, and then present it in that format without user intervention. The process is automatic. In both directions.Also, this TV does not get confused and freeze up when I am quick on the remote buttons as the Vizio did.Wi-Fi:I can't comment on the Wi-Fi since I don't use it on the TV, other than to say it successfully found my Wi-Fi channel and gave me access. I may use it in the future.Speakers:The speakers are adequate for us, providing clear speech and decent music. The TV is in a bedroom and sounds fine in that room. If you want movie theater sound you probably need an external speaker system.One negative is that the TV does not have an output jack for analog audio, such as a headphone. Only a digital audio jack.The manual:Panasonic does provide a printed (gasp) manual to use in assembling the base and setting up your TV. Detailed drawings of various possible connections are included. The TV is super easy to setup, essentially plugging it in and connecting to your TV source. That's it. The default picture needs no adjusting, but adjustments are available in you want to play around.  A 199 page manual is available online.  But you don't really need it.It was work to repack and return the Vizio TV using Amazon's free 30 day trial period (although Amazon was great, as usual, and credited us the full purchase price on the very next day after they received the return), but it did let us see how much better this Panasonic is and appreciate it so much more. I am actually grateful that we had problems with the Vizio else we might never have discovered this Panasonic.Packaging:The TV arrived in perfect condition, expertly packed with heavy tape holding the base safely away from the TV.Delivery:Amazon used Ceva for the delivery. Ceva lets you give them a time window for the delivery. We selected the 9:00 AM to noon window so we would be dressed and finished with breakfast before their arrival. However, they rang our doorbell at 8:00 AM, just as we sat down to breakfast. Inconvenient.The box was in perfect condition with no gouges or punctures.Repacking the TV in the box in the future if we need to will be a chore. I snapped several pictures as we unpacked the box so we can reverse the process if we ever need to. I saved printed copies of the pictures inside the box which we stored away.In conclusion:We have enjoyed this TV since July 16th. We like everything about it and obviously intend to keep it at the end of our 30 day trial. If anything happens that changes our minds, I will post an update. I will also post an update if I discover anything else that you should know about.", "Date": "July 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect TV!", "Author": "Michael Moody", "ReviewID": "R3S4BRISFMUZ3D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Unreal!

The sun shines directly onto the TV for a good six hours each day during the winter months. My plasma had great picture quality (phenomenal at night) but you simply couldn't watch it when it was sunny out.I wasn't expecting miracles because of the location of my TV in relation to the windows but even my in-laws (who are in town for the holiday) could not believe the difference. The sun was shining right on this Panny and you couldn't even tell. The picture was perfectly bright. This alone would warrant a five star rating from me.As for the picture quality, it's definitely far better than my previous TV which was top of the line when it came out. I was nervous because the quality of the picture in the store wasn't appealing but I know that you can't really judge on that since you never know how the stores have their TVs set up. I decided that I would trust the great reviews and I'm glad I did.Although I wanted 3D, it wasn't a major concern. I was actually very surprised at how good the passive 3D is on this set. If I stood right in front of the TV, I could see the limitations of passive 3D but my viewing area is 12 feet away and the 3D was great. My two year loved it.As for setup, it took me 30 minutes to get my old heavy plasma down and this significantly lighter LED up. The actual size of this 55\" TV was almost identical to my 50\" plasma.

With only a few adjustments the picture quality was excellent. Clear and vibrant colors with decent black level...not quite the intensity of my plasma TV. Also, very good motion viewing...again, not as clear as my plasma TV. I noticed, even when viewing a still/stationary scene, the background motion was not clear/crisp. e.g. trees rustling in background appear a bit fuzzy. These are minor issues only noticeable when really looking.This TV also lives up to its \"Smart\" capabilities by connecting to a wireless network seamlessly with the standard Internet applications. Netflix and Amazon Prime both play well with easy to navigate controls. There are other VOD choices as well as many other applications including Skype. There is a pretty good WEB browser...the best integrated TV browser I've used. I use the IOGEAR GKM681R 2.4GHz Wireless Compact Keyboard with Optical Trackball and Scroll Wheel (Silver/Black) which works very well with the browser...much better than the standard IR remote. Also, its DLNA (Home Networking) is a nice feature allowing you to access and play your media files directly from your computer.I was impressed with the 3D viewing on this TV too. Very bright picture quality with good \"pop-out\" capability paired with the Panasonic DMP-BDT220 Integrated Wi-Fi 3D Blu-ray DVD Player. The 3D glasses (4 pairs included) are lightweight and comfortable. I also found that the Real 3D glasses from the theater work too...I inadvertently had brought a pair home and, out of curiosity, tried them with this TV and they worked perfectly.The only negative issue I really have with this TV is the sound quality. Not so much that it has no \"depth\" but, it just doesn't get quite loud enough. This is mostly true with TV viewing because VOD sounds much better and even the DLNA and USB/SD Card volume levels are okay. I made this better by using the CE Compass Digital SPDIF / Coaxial to Analog L/R RCA Audio Decoder w/ 3.5mm Headphone Jack to connect to my (older) analog stereo.*FYI: This TV requires an audio DECODER to connect to standard RCA (L/R) stereo connections. I tried a simple converter but learned the converter can only convert PCM/LPCM signals where this TV can only output Dolby/DTS signals which need to be \"decoded\".Overall, I am very happy with this TV and for less than $600.00, I don't think you will find a better value.

I don't normally buy TV's online but rather go to a regular store to test out the features and pick it up on credit, ect.  I got a few to test because I wasn't quite sure what I was looking for at first.  The misleading titles, the marketing gimmicks (basically all the crap) just gets to your head if you don't know how to filter it.  I tried a few plasmas and the 3d features of active and a few passive TV sets.  CRAP!!!!  Did my research and went through hours if not days trying to understand refresh rates all the way down to white levels.  This is the only one that fit my needs and it might fit yours too.If your a gamer don't think to hard just get this TV now.  If your worrying about energy costs and saving money on electricity you will benefit in this department as well.  Otherwise stick to plasma.  This actually has an LG panel.  Panasonics technology has been implemented within it.  If you go down to the core components it is still an IPS panel that is Japanese quality. The bezel is wrapped in a plastic wing that almost reminds me of a logitech keyboard. The stand is very early 90's and squared, which I think  is a style they should keep! More retro and less sleek and fancy, its a TV not a vase!I mention gaming before and this is why, if you don't know much about input lag and you just want something for movies you should be alright.  But if your eyeing a TV strictly for playing fast moving games (first person shooter, ect.) and can't stand screen tearing or artifacting or some sort of slowing when your playing, get this one.  I have tried others including the nicer new LG LM7600 designed for gamers and comes with dual play.  The lag on that one was close to 40MS!  On this TV your getting 24 to 30 MS max.  The colors look superb when properly calibrated, and the simplicity of the menus is still a key feature for me made by the Panasonic line.  I don't care for the \"smart\" features or the fact that it has internet access.  If your not looking for 3d or smart features go ahead and get the TCL42D30.  It's older but useful for strictly gaming/viewing content.Now for the juicy parts of the TV...Yes it has dual play.  When in split screen press the 3d button and then press the red button on your remote to activate and extra menu to select the split screen type.  On select games you can experience fast paced gaming with your friend using the LG dual play glasses without cross talk or any weirdness or lag. If your hooking it up to your PS3 for the first time it will detect that you have a 3d panel.  Just make sure you set your correct screen size, most people complain about why their 3d isn't working or is greyed out in games.  You have to set your output settings on automatic.When I first started it up you get your welcome screen.  Just follow the directions and set it  right the first time.  Then go down to your ethernet settings and set that up.  Check for firmware updates and flash that before doing anything else.  Everything should stay saved afterwards and in my case I disabled any inputs including the tuner that I did not want to use.  One thing to note on this particular model is the remote.  The finally made some changes such as a glow in the dark button to find your illumination button, which is nice for using in pure darkness.  I did not see any clouding, banding or any \"flashlight\" effects with this being an edge lit LED model.  But others may have different panels.  After warming it and using it for a few days, go ahead and calibrate.  If your gaming make sure you set game mode on, and make your input GAME or WII/PS3/XBOX/PCI bought this from Amazon as used in like new condition.  I was hesitant to buy it this way but it turned out to be awesome.  Brand new this TV is well over $1000.  I paid $600 and it is flawless, with the exception of a few smears and dust that came off with some cleaner.  It still had the plastic cover on the bezel as well.  I was not impressed with the packaging though.  Maybe the UPS driver had a bad day but it had a big hole in the side in which I could see the TV.  There was no protection inside the box on the front or back, so if the UPS driver did have an EXTRA bad day he could've pulled out a screw driver and stuck the center of the box to leave me with a nice surprise.There wasn't a picture of the inputs on the back so I have uploaded a photo.

I just picked up this sweet 42 Panny. I have owned everything Panasonic for decades even my first 12 inch Black-n-White (which was awesome, btw (o:). Everything was packed so neatly and individually to protect everything. The screen itself is actually heavier than a Samsung 47 inch LED, indicates better or best-in-class build quality. The PQ (out of the box with no calibration)is museum quality(even for me). I turned off auto motion as I did see some picture jitter but once turned off, OMG, and the WOW FACTOR IS HERE! I don't care much for the 3D or the apps as the PQ is my main concern. I did turn-off C.A.T.S (ambient light feature), the screen flickered too much when adjusting for various light conditions which was annoying. The skimpy amount of apps can always be upgraded by Panny's future firmware and/or software updates through Viera and possibly future Flash implementations, etc. I have an HDMI PC connected no need for me to browse on the TV with a remote. The network, smart and wireless connections to Viera are flawless. The sound is good for small areas or when you have neighbors on all 4 walls. Connecting to a receiver and related sound system will suit other tastes. The Black levels (read some bad reviews) are a thing of beauty, full, deep blacks (out of the box and not calibrated).

I LOVE this TV.  First, in the comments section Mr. Debeaulieu asked if I was perhaps mistaken on the ARC.  I was.  This TV does have bidirectional communication with other devices and (unless giving it confusing directions, as I did) directs communication to the last turned on device.Then -- and this is the clincher -- I discovered that the TV appears to do its own streaming from PC.  Gone is the choppy video I suffered through before.  That alone merits a revision from four to five stars.  Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, here I come!=====================================Previous Review:It's hard to write anything that hasn't already been said about this TV, so I'll just sum up my quick observations after a month of use1.  Smart TV isn't that smart: there are very few apps / programs featured by Panasonic.  While the basics, Netflix, Amazon and YouTube are there, there are a number lacking too like Vudu.2.  There are two USB slots, one that works handily for plugging a keyboard (wired or wireless) into.  Nice feature.3.  Passive 3D is excellent, but so are a number of other brands.  For the record, this is our second Passive 3D TV.  My favor leans toward LG in this regard.4.  If you don't have a Panasonic receiver, you're out of luck.  This doesn't have bi-directional ARC or HEC.  Get a universal remote or forever be pressing buttons. . .5.  Browser appears to be some Opera-based derivative.  In any case, it doesn't play the commonly used Adobe Flash file.  Then again, I think all TVs have this issue.  LG certainly does too.  (My take: Since there are so many HDMI connectors, and the TV also includes a DVI / PC connector, hook up your laptop or PC to the TV to watch Comedy Central)6.  WiFi connects easily and within a minute or so of the TV being turned on.Seriously though, for the price point,you can't go wrong with this unit.  Add a 3D Blu-ray, buy a movie, pay a couple of bucks (literally) for a few extra Cinema 3D glasses, grab a bag of popcorn and have a few friends over for a movie.  Within a couple of viewings, you'll have more than made up the price of going to the theaters.", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV especially at the Black Friday price", "Author": "UncleAl", "ReviewID": "R1EZGULED2NYRK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this tv for a month now. Got it during the Black Friday sale for $899 at a local big box retailer. I was actually able to order online a few days prior because I was a reward zone member. I upgraded from a 5 year old Sony LCD. There was nothing wrong with it and it still had a great picture. I only upgraded because of the sale price and a bigger screen.Pros:- Got it at the sale price.- Picture quality is very good.- Passive 3d. I hardly use it, but it's a nice feature to have. Plus the glasses are cheap if you need to replace them.- HDMI ARC. I didn't even know about this feature until I started searching for soundbars.- Smart tv with wifi connectivity. Never really cared for this, but it's nice to have, since I am an Amazon prime member. I can watch shows and movies without having to use another device.- Thin bezel compared to my old LCD.Cons:- Speakers. This is the biggest drawback on this tv. I bought the Samsung HW-E450 Wireless AirTrack Sound Bar because I couldn't take the tiny laptop sound coming from the  tv. Even when you tweak the settings, it still sounded horrible. Also, forget about turning up the volume. It just makes it sound worse. You need to invest in a soundbar or home theater system.- Motion picture mode. Also known as, soap opera effect. This comes preset to maximum. Unless you like this look, you'll need to change it. No big deal, but I just wanted to point it out.- Flashlight effect (ghosting). My tv has the flashlighting effect on the bottom two corners. It's very noticeable when it cuts out from a scene and fades into black. It is more pronounced on the bottom right. I turned the black levels down and it's less noticeable, but still there. I was deciding on whether or not to exchange it for another, but  From what I've read, this seems to be common with a lot of edge lit LED panels, so I'll probably just keep it and deal with the little bit of ghosting.- Ads. This just bugs the s*** out of me. Even the volume banner will show ads when you press +/-. Not cool of Panasonic to do this. If you thought the Kindle ads were annoying. Wait til you spend a grand on a tv and there's no way to get rid of them (besides turning wifi off).Overall a good buy, especially at the Black Friday price. The major drawback and the -1 star is for the crappy speakers and the added cost of buying a $200+ soundbar. I would also shave a half star for the ads.

I've been looking at getting a 3D TV for almost a year now. I've tried out active and passive TVs many times. There are some advantages to active shutter TVs, the main one being clarity. They show a higher quality picture when you're standing right in front of them at the brick and mortar store. But when you sit back at a recommended distance from the TV, the passive 3D TVs look just as clear and crisp.On to this Panasonic Viera! For the price of this TV you really can't go wrong. Even if you aren't looking for a 3D TV and want a good LED TV, this one is just right. The viewing angles you get from the IPS screen are incredible. There is virtually no color degradation or light issues at near right angles to the TV. The picture is very sharp and there are plenty of brightness and backlight settings to accommodate your environment.The internet capabilities aren't as broad as you'll get in higher end TVs, but it really has all you'll need. It has Youtube, Netflix, Hulu Plus, Pandora, and more. It even has Ustream for watching live streaming events! And you can stream your own videos, pictures, and music directly over wifi or from a USB flash drive. Netflix, Youtube, and Hulu Plus all stream in HD (if the content is HD).On to the 3D! So far, I have tried 3D Blurays, 3D content from my cable provider, and converted 3D on regular HD channels. I am really blown away by how good this 3D TV is. There is no cross talk or ghosting when viewed at the proper angles. And by this, I only mean up and down. Since it uses a film on the screen and passive 3D, it's limited to 15-20 degrees viewing angle up and down. But left to right, you get great clarity and 3D depth at nearly the full 172 degree viewing angle of the TV. From the extreme sides, the depth is diminished ever so slightly. Other than that, the picture is near perfect! Converted 3D lacks the same depth that you get from actual 3D content and some bright colors such as fire effects and lights can sometimes cause layering issues, but that happens to all 3D converting TVs.Also, for anyone using their PS3 for 3D Bluray content: You can use the TV's remote to control all functions, even the PS3 main menu!

The nice-to-have were (e) wall mountable and (e) thin.This set really delivered on all of this.  In fact, I would say that the picture and viewing angles are the best I have seen on this size of TV (be it LCD or Plasma).  The picture really is amazingly sharp and the black levels are great (yes, a Plasma will have better black levels but the off-angle viewing is just unacceptable)The only real downside I have found is that you really always want to get audio via your home theater setup as the speakers in the TV are, by necessity of its thin size, rather anemic.  They are actually rather good given the size and placement, but that is not saying much.  I can see using them for TV news casts and talk shows but even that gets a bit grating after a while due to the frequency response.However, don't let the speakers stop you from getting this set.  A TV sound bar could be added at low cost but you would be hard pressed to find a better picture or better viewing angles.  (I know that my search has left me thinking that this is the best)With its built in internet connectivity and Amazon Instant Video (with support for HD content) this TV is wonderful.  The navigation in the Amazon library is a bit painful due to the amount of content available, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that bad.  It helps if you have an iPhone or iPad since there is an app that connects to the TV over WiFi and lets you use a touch keyboard.  I have the optical out from the TV into my Onkyo amp.  This setup is great for watching Glee episodes that are available.I have no wish or need for the 3D support, but it is nice that this is passive 3D.  Yes, that means you get half-resolution when you use the 3D glasses but it also means less stress (no flashing/flickering shutters) and if you are sitting over 12 feet away, even that resolution loss is hard to notice.

So far there is no major issues and I like it for the reasons that other reviews have covered, so no need to repeat. Here are something that are not so great and I think can be easily fixed by a firmware or minor hardware update. Then this TV would be a great set.Comparing to a 7 years old 40inch Sony LCD (mid tier model), the shortfalls of this Panasonic are: (1) inferior contrast - picture is not as crispy; (2)color of some dark scenes is not as accurate; (3) sound is much weaker which feels silly for the size of the TV; (4)backlit uniformity being even worse than a 7-yr old technology was hard to accept, but eventually I found peace with it.Comparing to a 55inch similarly priced Samsung that I bought earlier but returned, this TV lacks (1) media playability. The samsung could play whatever media format I tried but this TV can only play a few. No support to the popular AVI files is hard to believe; (2) functions of the media player is also very limited; (3) at least one video file plays choppy while it was totally smooth on a 32 inch Samsung I have.Other issues I found with this TV are (1) wireless won't connect when two or more memory sources (SD and USB) are connected; (2) when displaying dark scenes, occasionally the brightness of the screen can fluctuate; (3) so far I couldn't make DLNA to work with the media server built in the wireless router - all media files are not supported.Despite the issues above, I still enjoy this TV mainly for the beautiful colors it can display and good viewing angle.

We are still using the old style TVs in my house that are 10+ years old. The 42in Panasonic VIERA TC-L42ET5 was purchased by my household to replace a 25 year old TV.So we started shopping around to see what our options were. I had been looking at other cheaper TVs but since our TV technology is all old school we would need to buy some kind of device to connect it to stream with something like a Wii or Roku. So thinking about the added cost of upgrading our TV tech it just made sense to go with this TV that had that built in for us.I purchased the TV when it dropped to $695.99 and what the heck lets throw in the free month of Amazon Prime to get the free two day shipping. I did actually end up paying $8.99 more to have it delivered on Saturday when I knew hubby would be home to receive it. It was coming from a warehouse in the mideast and I'm in CA so I wasn't sure it would make it since I ordered it late Thursday night. Not only did it, but it came early on Saturday morning!Now my hubby and kids are not very techy, but they were so excited to get it they wanted to try setting it up while I was at work. It was sooo user friendly that they were able to get it hooked up to our wifi and antenna. The had used it and learned a lot about it before I even got home from work. I'd say this is a definite PRO for the TV. Easy to set up, easy to use.So far we have been using it for a month and really like it. It comes with YouTube, Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime already loaded as usable apps so you can log into your accounts and start using them without having to create a log in to the Panasonic shop like you need to for other apps. I haven't tried the Hulu app, but the others were easy to use. My favorite is the YouTube app and how you can either log directly into a YouTube account or if you are like us with multiple iPods you can link your device to the TV and use your devices app to control YouTube. This is awesome because all four of us watch distinctly different types of videos and this means none of us will have to get weird stuff showing up in our recommendations or playlists. It also meant easy control since we could use the iPods keyboard to type things in and touch screen rather than the TV remote control. With how much people steam now a days I would consider this another PRO for the TV as it can start streaming right out of the box.The TV has so many settings for color, lighting, viewing, etc I have been playing with all of them and like having all the options. The color and picture quality is excellent. Changing the settings was very easy to do, and I have had to do it. When I was watching Castle the TV show it was very dark most of the time so I did have to change the color/light settings to better view it. There is also an Eco feature that will dim or brighten the TV as it see's fit due to lighting in the room. We've had this active and have noticed it make the change but it never made the viewing experience worse so we let it to do its thing. Some people may not like this, but there are so many things you can customize you cane set it just the way you like it!The one major thing I dislike is that it displays ads. One is under the internet apps and that is easy enough to push to the a very last and unused page so that you never have to see it. The other is when you are changing the volume sometimes a small sponsored ad pops up underneath it. Another ad pops up when I access something, but frankly I ignore it and can't even remember at this point when that is. I read in some reviews that all but the internet apps one can be turned off. I have dug all through settings and have yet to figure out how. It is a CON...however I don't feel it is a big enough deal to do anything more than knock off a star. I really think they should have made mention of it in the product description. I knew about it before buying the TV because of reading user reviews.The other thing I'm not a big fan of is you can download a mobile app to your smartphone. I downloaded it to my iPod and it is good for controlling the TV and an easier way to use the keyboard functions. That is about it. I can't seem to get the stream pictures or video from your device feature to work. It is also very clunky and not easy to use. You have to go back and forth between different sections of the app to use the keyboard. It's not very intuitive or user friendly.Now about the 3D, I didn't buy the TV for that. So currently I have no 3D players or discs to get the full effect of it. The TV came with four pairs of glasses which is generous. It does have a 2D to 3D feature which you can use on any thing you watch. The kids like playing with it, and it does change how you see the picture. I myself am not super impressed, but I think my eyes just don't work with 3D of any kind. I'm not impressed by the IMAX or Movie Theater versions of 3D either. I really don't want to rate it either way as I think it's me that makes it not work right, and my kids like it.I would recommend this TV to anyone who is looking for a starter Smart TV or an easy upgrade. We are very happy with our purchase and my husband would like to buy a second one for our bedroom. As that TV is still working we are not rushing to replace it. However when the time comes we will be looking at VIERA TVs as a definite option!Update 8/17/2013: We got a hand me down Wii from a family member last month. Though we were excited to get it and hooked it up quickly we realized that this TV can only connect to one composite OR component cable at a time. We still have an older DVD player, a PS2 and an old Xbox, all three connected to a switchbox so we didn't realize there would be a problem until we went to hook up the Wii. It works on the other kind of cable so each time we wanted to switch between them I have to stretch behind the TV and disconnect and reconnect. It was beginning to become annoying so I got online and did some research and found that I could get a device and connect the Wii via the HDMI ports which we have four of completely unused since all of our devices are old. The device I used was Wii to HDMI 720P / 1080P HD Output Upscaling Converter - Supports All Wii Display Modes, HDMI Upscale to 720p or 1080p Output along with this cable AmazonBasics 2-Pack, High-Speed HDMI Cables 6.5 feet -- Supports Ethernet, 3D, and Audio Return [Newest Standard] and now everything is working fabulous together and mom is not getting annoyed having to switch cables all the time. If you have older devices you will want to take this into consideration that you will need to find fixes or upgrade your devices.Other than this we still really like the TV and stand by the original review.", "Date": "May 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "WOW!!!", "Author": "Gmann714", "ReviewID": "R16TXAZ69V8BUF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this TV as a replacement for an older Panasonic Plasma that I had in the Man Cave and it is great.

I love it. Haven't played a game yet so can't comment on that thought I bet it's just as incredible. As far as performance, who cares about the black issue really. It's not that serious. The Wi-Fi wouldn't work, had to connect it to my router but the apps are worthless. I have my PC hooked up to it and I have a phone. Both way better than a TV for doing anything online. They could've left that out and made it cheaper. Don't care about that either though. I would pay maybe.....$30 more for the 240hz. Absolutely no more than that. Point is 120hz is just fine. You see a little lag in the refresh rate when things are moving really fast but it's miniscule and 240hz TVs aren't an extra $30. More like $100-200. Not worth it. All the cons are non-issues.

So far we are loving the picture quality and size, although we only use it for watching DVDs and Blu-rays. I can't speak to the Internet features as we haven't really bothered to try and set them up, even though we do have a router we could use. Apparently our DSL connection isn't very fast so it would probably only lead to lots of buffering and drop outs so we're happy just to have this amazing home-theater (to us, anyway) big screen. The sound quality of the TV's speakers is laughable - our next purchase will be a speaker system to max out the surround sound. If you keep the TV's speakers turned on and add outside sound you can get an interesting echo effect by turning up the TV's volume past 10 or so! We're getting by with a pair of Philips 15w computer speakers (with a bass booster).We've tried out our one (!) 3D Blu-ray, \"Finding Nemo\", which is a lot of fun to watch with the glasses provided. It's a gorgeous, colorful movie anyway, so the 3D just adds another level of \"wow\". Try it with the subtitles on, they really pop!The menus are very easy to navigate, and once we adjusted the picture to eliminate the \"soap opera effect\" we really haven't found it necessary to make any further adjustments. It's set to automatically adjust resolution for the DVD played, and it does just that. As I mentioned, we aren't taking full advantage of all the VIERA's features, but maybe in time we will. Four months down the road from our initial setup, we are still in the honeymoon phase of our beautiful big screen TV.Update: May 24, 2013We finally set up the Viera Connect to take advantage of some of its Internet features, so I just want to mention that. The setup wasn't too aggravating - we did need to enter the MAC address and then reset the IP address on our router to match all the router-driven devices in the house, which took about 15 minutes. Then we discovered the fun of Amazon Instant Videos, which is kind of like pay-per-view. This is a much better way to go for us, rather than a subscription service like Netflix, but also tons more convenient than driving to our \"nearest\" Redbox DVD rental kiosk, which is 20 miles away.  It takes a while for movies to download, but then again, we're only on a DSL connection. Just enough time to get the popcorn made! The one and only gripe I have with the ET5 is that there is no headphone jack. We've upgraded to a better pair of Cerwin-Vega computer speakers, so we had to invest about $40 in an audio converter (ViewHD Optical SPDIF/Coaxial Digital to RCA L/R Analog Audio Converter with 3.5mm Jack Support Simultaneous Headphone with Speaker Outputs) and an optical SPDIF cable (Mediabridge Toslink Cable - (6 Feet) - Optical Digital Audio Cable). Had there been a 3.5mm audio output, it would saved that expense.

(Our initial plan was to bring the Samsung 58\" Plasma up from the basement but we decided it would be too big for the space).Setup was a breeze in large part because I paid someone to mount the television, but it quickly found our wi-fi network, accepted our security password and was able to connect to the internet.  The television settings were already set to \"custom\" so I don't know if that was done at the factory or if done by a prior owner. I hope the former!My wife is constantly saying that it looks like we are right there with the people.  I am going to try to soften the motion picture setting and see if that is a more pleasing experience, but so far I don't see anything wrong with sharing my living room with the actors, though it is weird sometimes to notice the camera shake.  I don't know if that is just because of the size of the television or because of the motion picture setting, because I haven't yet fooled around with the settings.We've not tried the 3D yet -- we never use that feature on the basement television though I already prefer the passive system to the active shutter display and would be happy to give up some picture quality to save on worrying about batteries for the glasses, or my guests breaking the more expensive active shutter glasses.  With the passive glasses it is just the cheap plastic glasses you use in the movie theaters.What really blew me away was how easy it is to stream movies/television to the set from Amazon or Netflix.  There are hundreds of childrens' videos available and I have to say it is very nice to be able to see different episodes of Dora/Diego/Barney or whatever because there are so many to choose from (instead of being stuck recording whatever is airing).  And now we can watch television series's that we never watched before all without commercials.I did manage to get the iPad app to work with the television though it was a pain in the neck to do so.  I wound up creating a static ip address and turning off (temporarily) my firewall. I don't know which it was, but after doing both, the app recognized my television set where it previously only ran in demo mode.  It now works flawlessly  but I don't really think it is that great of an App so I would not be overly disappointed if I lost this \"feature\".The picture is stunning. At least to our eye. I am sure you can agonize over plasma, led, lcd or whatever all week long but in the end I don't see how anybody would be disappointed with this television.

I understand that most TV aren't capable of passing surround sound via HDMI either. However for people who are willing to spend $700+ they are very likely to have a home theater system as well. This con means I have to run separate optical cable for each attached HDMI device if I want to have surround sound effect. The use of optical cable also means that I miss out on HD audio (multi-channel LPCM, Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD MA). I could buy a brand new receiver that is capable of HDMI audio processing via extra HDMI inputs. But receiver is not something you replace frequently; a good receiver lasts a very long time. This feature is very easy to implement (as TV simply re-routes sound stream to ARC) yet Panasonic elected not to.* Built-in SD/USB player is garbage.It is slow and excludes some \"must have\" supports, including MP4 Audio, subtitles like .ssa or .subt (tested with subtitle inside .mkv, not sure about separate subtitle). Panasonic also lied about its support on Vorbis audio (when playing video with Vorbis audio codec TV says it is not supported). One thing I cannot ignore is when a manufacturer promises something but later turns out to be a lie. Ironically, Panasonic home theater system has a far superior SD/USB player (with only downside being incomplete support on .srt and .ssa/.ass).

Best of all Amazon was about $250 less on this model than local stores.For those new to 3D, like I was, 3D is delivered to the TV as 2 pictures either stacked one above the other or displayed side by side. Your TV should notice the pictures and try to switch into 3D mode. I would have expected a digital signal encoded in the data so the TV that would display as 3D instantaneously. From what I have seen, the signal either does not exist, or it is flaky. There are options for 3D detection in the TV menu. Sometimes you must manually tell the TV the format with the remote. I see these as flaws in 3D technology, NOT in the TV.The \"smart\" aspect doesn't impress me much. Everything in the living room these days plays Netflix. I chose a Rouku box prior to this TV. The TV does play Netflix too. The best part of the connection is being able to receive a TV software update. Network stuff is interesting, but I suspect much more limited than a PC browser.I use a wired network connection as I live a block from a University and my living room is awash with 14 wireless networks.I may have done better, cash wise, to skip the 3D and \"Smart\" features, but how would you know, unless you tried.

This is an excellent 3D LED HDTV and Amazon's current pricing is very aggressive (especially the 47 inch model).

I have a 2011 LG 3D Plasma and a Sony 3D LED that both use active 3D glasses. The passive glasses on this unit appear (to my eyes) to show a significantly better 3D field with no crosstalk (using Prometheus 3D as a reference) and less eye strain at a much lower cost (4 glasses included, ~ $10 each for more). One item of note, I have the 55 inch with a June 2012 build date. The packaging showed no signs of being dropped or any impacts. My unit had 3 pretty significant dents in the back panel at the top of the set. From what I can tell it left the factory that way (QC?! - same issue mentioned in other reviews for the 55).So, if you've been thinking about taking the plunge on a 3D HDTV but weren't sure the technology for home use was as effective as the theaters.....buy one of the ET5 sets and I think you'll be impressed.", "Date": "October 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great LED TV for the price", "Author": "Skibabette", "ReviewID": "R28Q46UOWFO8VM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV (Panasonic VIERA TC-L55ET5) offers a lot of bang for the buck (we paid $1,099 for the 55\" TV, and shipping was free).

(well more or less)Overall, the picture quality of this TV is quiet excellent.  I was very impressed with it.  The 2D/3D technology built into this is outstanding and includes 4 pair of 3D glasses.  I grew tired of looking at TV's with the blurring problem fixed by doing this or that, and not having it what I want.  This TV has a setting which allows you to set this for your preference, and I found the settings worked very well.  I could turn them off, adjust for it a little, or a lot.If you're looking for a TV with a great picture, very good 2D/3D ability, then look no further.If you're looking for internet or specifically media streaming, the TV falls far too short for me. I've been waiting a good media server type TV for ages, and was very anxious to give this TV a try, but was very soon disappointed.First of all, advertisements scrolling across my screen?  Really?  come on guys you cannot be serious... but yes it's true.Second, the TV supports a variety of video containers, but has just the bare basics of this covered.  The .avi container is the most popular video format in existence today. Every other format combined does not even come close to the shear volume of avi's out there and this TV doesn't even support it which is disappointing.  While there is a move to x264, mp4 as the new 'standard', it is far from exclusive, and avi (i.e. DivX/XviD support) containers will be around for many years to come. I'm quiet shocked it was not included.Still, I already have a networked media tank which I will have to continue to use.Overall, it is NOT a media tank and I wouldn't really call it a media server either, it is best described as having some limited media support.  If Panasonic would team up with Syabas and design and implement a true media server, Panasonic would have another problem, never being able to keep these TV\"s in stock, there would be instant huge demand for this TV. Products using media servers with Syabas' open source platform has a well established track record for doing media serving/streaming from many sources including on-line streaming.  So why Panasonic tried to re-invent the wheel here, who knows.Many cheaper TV's are getting to where they are limiting the number of connections to the TV, which many offering only 2 HDMI connections, and maybe a component/RCA connection, and one or two USB ports for photos.  You will quickly run out of connections, your cable tv converter will use one, then a DVD/Blu-Ray player the other, then you are out of luck with anything else you might want to hook up.  The nice thing is this TV has 4 HDMI connections, and a component/RCA connection, AND USB ports.So overall, a TV which has an excellent picture and 2D/3D capability that is really very good, great connectivity (HDMI ports, etc.), and fair to poor streaming media services ability.

I turned off the auto brightness feature because I found it didn't really produce the brightness I like based on the ambient light. I set a level I like and it works great for all ambient light situations. The most important adjustment I made was to turn of the 'motion blur reduction' which Panasonic calls 'Motion Picture Setting'. As many others have commented, the 'soap opera effect' was unbearable. It makes everything look like a cheap 70's TV soap opera. By setting the 'Motion Picture Setting' to OFF, it fixes this problem. This is a product of the high internally generated frame refresh rate which can make a fast changing image appear sharper. I found the motion blur reduction feature is fine for sports programming, but for regular TV and movies, it had to go. The locally generated 3D (TV converting a normal 2D signal to 3D) works fine. It's more of a novelty feature to me and I don't really use it. The network setup was easy. The online content is a little sluggish but works fine and as expected for a TV.

I chose the 47\" TV because it was the largest one that would fit in our available space.  And, it just barely fits (no fault of Panasonic, though.)  The \"Standard\" picture is so poor and dim that I cannot understand how Panasonic could ship it that way.  On the other hand, the \"Game\" picture setting is quite good.  And, by tweaking the \"Custom\" setting, guided by some of the reviews on the Amazon site, I get a very nice picture.  In overall brilliance, it barely rivals that of my 7-year-old VIZIO CCFL-lit 1080i TV.  So, though the picture is quite good, I can hardly call it exceptional.The sound is muffled and basically inadequate for even a modest sized room, but I hooked it up to my ONKYO AV-Receiver 5.1 system, so that is not a drawback for me.I was concerned about shipping damage when I placed the order with Amazon because one reviewer displayed a bent bezel, presumably as a result of shipping.  However, the TV was boxed with styrofoam spacers, and the TV shipping carton was placed inside a larger shipping carton that was filled with novel popcorn substitutes that resembled A-Frames made from stiff cardboard.  So, though the package was heavy and unwieldy to unbox, the TV arrived in pristine condition.I have not played around with the apps, other than to test Skype with the accompanying Skype camera (which disappointed) and to try the browser.  The Viera app for iOS ran OK on my iPad, but I could not get it to type in URLs consistently on the browser app.  I have since obtained a Bluetooth USB dongle, but have yet to try it with my Kingston BT keyboard (which works fine with my Apple TV, BTW).I have yet to experience a 3D presentation, but I tried the 3D glasses by simulating 3D, and the effect was enjoyable, though hardly worth the trouble for regular viewing.  it's nice to have the 3D capability in reserve for future possibilities, however.Finally, the price on Amazon has escalated about $250 since i purchased this TV from Amazon.

I bought it for $959.99, and later got it adjusted to $899.99 to match a competitor's price during the 14-day price guarantee Amazon offers.I had first bought the Panasonic TC-55UT50 plasma TV, but it had a very audible buzzing noise during bright scenes and I was getting some image retention with the ESPN logo (and other channel logos) and life bars etc. from some video games.  I had Panasonic send a tech out for the buzzing--he replaced all the screws holding the various boards on inside the TV, but it didn't help with the buzzing.  So I decided that a plasma TV just didn't fit my needs and decided to send it back and try this LED set.After having this TV for over a week, I can say that for me it was a great decision.  The picture is still great.  Dark scenes were better on the plasma (plasma's have better black levels) and the plasma handled motion with less blur.  But bright, colorful scenes pop more on the LED since it offers a much brighter picture than the plasma.  I also prefer the 3D on this set.  It's a passive 3D(glasses don't have batteries) set and I find that the 3D is clearer than on the Panasonic plasma which used active 3D technology.  Better yet, this TV comes with 4 pairs of glasses, where as the glasses were separate with the plasma--and pricey at $60 on Amazon for the Panasonic ones, or $19 for the Samsung ones that work with it.Moreover, this TV is dead silent with no buzz whatsoever, and it's nice not having to worry at all about image retention since I watch a ton of ESPN and play a lot of video games.In sum, great TV--especially for the price if you catch it on sale.

I've always liked Panasonic products since back in the box TV days, but I guess times have changed.At the store I had a hunch that there was something off about the screen compared to other TVs and I couldn't pinpoint what it was but I assumed that all the screens were connected using coax, so the signal may not be at its best and HDMI would be the true test and so I took one home.Setup was easy.  TV was on the heavier side compared to my LG, but I didn't mind.  I had it hooked into my Comcast HD box and the picture was just okay. I tried messing with the settings to make it brighter and ended up setting it to vivid.  But Vivid was too bright on some channels to the point where parts of people's faces were white and on other channels it was okay.  This is something I never experienced with my LG.  The sound left much to be desired.  Remembering the option for AI sound and video from my Panasonic box TVs, I tried turning those on, but the audio didn't really change a whole lot and I could have sworn the picture didn't change at all.I then realized that the picture was rather decent when viewing directly from in front and was much darker from the side.  I checked the specs for the TV again and it said 178 degree wide viewing angle and here the picture was darkening at even 40 degrees from directly in front.  I've got a 2 story living room with lots of windows so I thought it might be the light reflecting from the windows, but closing the blinds didn't help a lot neither did watching the TV at night.  This was a major drawback because I need to see the TV from various angles because I often watch TV while doing other things and am walking around all over the house.On a positive note, watching 3d on this TV was really nice.  Comcast offered a variety of 3D options on their on demand so I didn't need to buy a 3d movie in order to test that out.  2D to 3D conversion was done very well..probably better than the LGs that I tested in store.  Although the brights weren't as bright as I would have liked without overdoing it on Vivid mode, the blacks were decent.The viewing angle and the screen brightness was the deal breaker and I packed it up and returned it within 24 hours.  I really wanted to keep this TV and Frys had it for $899 which would have been a fabulous deal.  Unfortunately, it didn't work out.  Price is secondary to picture quality.  One other thing I didn't like were banner ads when I turned on the TV.  Really Panasonic?  You want me to see a banner ad for American Airlines and others as soon as I turn on my TV?  Having the TV come with pre-installed software like computers do is fine.  But banner ads is going a bit too far.  Unacceptable.  What's next?  Pop up ads when I'm watching my favorite TV show?  Yup ... times have changed.  I really wanted to keep this TV.", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wow, a steal!", "Author": "chris c", "ReviewID": "R2JQWU9ROIWGT4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked up this TV on the special deal about 2 weeks ago,  and it was a steal! ($692 including tax and shipping!)  I was looking for a new tv,  and have been impressed with the latest led's out there.  I had a good, but older Hitachi plasma that was sucking up energy.  I read all the reviews for  Samsung, LG, Visio and Panasonic among others,  and this TV was on my list.  It was not rated as highly as some others,  but seemed to offer real value.It arrived in great condition,  and was moderately easy to set up.  I was immediately blown away by the clarity, brightness and great color of the display.  My old TV was good,  this one is great. I mainly watch live broadcasts, i.e. news or sports programming, and this set is so clear that you are immediately aware of discrepancies in quality of the camera,  the lighting, the production values, and the signal quality, from shot to shot.  ESPN has much higher quality cameras than does Root Sports for example.  The 3rd base camera is not nearly as good as the center field camera,  the live on the scene feed is blurry compared with the pristine studio shot of the news desk, etc. For content such as movies or pre-produced TV shows, even commercials,  the picture blows me away.I was prepared to be underwhelmed by the 3D but was shocked by how good it was.  I was able to get the last few days of the Olympic 3D coverage.  What a revelation.  It is so cool.  I have since watched some ESPN 3D and 3NET content (direct TV)and it is fantastic.  The 2D to 3D conversion feature only produces a moderate effect, and it isn't worth the effort of donning the glasses.I found the factory picture settings to be really obnoxious,  and it took me some time to get the color, black levels, and brightness to a point where I was happy,  but it does have lots of options,  and I was able to get a superb picture eventually.  I downloaded some calibration information from a couple of websites,  but found it not really helpful.  Trial and error will get you there.I have not hooked it up to my computer or internet yet,  so I don't know how that works,  but have used the Media Player option to view pictures from my SD camera card,  and have listened to music off of a USB drive,  and found it reasonably user friendly.  Incidentally,  the internal speakers are only adequate,  ok for play by play, or news shows,  but definitely lacking in any bass when listening to a soundtrack or music of any kind.  I got a great Yamaha sound bar that solved that problem.I was not expecting to be so happy with this purchase,  and was just glad to get a good deal.  I was surprised, and really impressed, especially, since I didn't have a bad TV before.  I saw what was out there,  and was looking for low end, really,  but feel that I got a TV with a fantastic display,  the latest technology, and packed with features for an unbelievable price.UPDATE as of 11/17/12:  I have gotten it hooked up to the internet,  and find it is OK.  It's browser is workable,  but navigation and typing in addresses is laborious with the remote.  Not at all like pointing and clicking with a keyboard and mouse.  It really needs a mouse. Other than that,  it seems to work fine.  I use the YouTube app, Pandora, and InTune,  and find them a great addition when nothing else is watchable on DirectTV.  On long YouTube video clips,  it starts to buffer after awhile,  which is annoying,  but I'm used to that on my desktop,  which is memory challenged as well.  I assume that streaming movies may run into the same issue.", "Date": "August 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Random Observations", "Author": "G", "ReviewID": "R3GKJ3I2KIIBGA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Really good TV - Now Some Random Observations:-2D-3D conversion is ok.

Kids are vaguely disappointed that the closest items are on the same visual plane as the screen and background images are sent back, rather than closest items come forward of the visual plane of the screen.-Web Browser - it says flash enabled, but won't stream from ESPN3 because flash isn't supported.  Why even have a web browser if can't stream from ESPN3?  I'm serious what's the point of browser on a TV if it can only look at static pages and can't stream from flash?  If anyone knows a fix please let me know.

LeClair \"-BLeClair12\"", "ReviewID": "R1OB3GLLQ53D3D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been in the market for a new TV for quite some time to replace my aging 32\" Sony Bravia LCD. As someone who has grown to appreciate quality and strive for perfection when it comes to TV settings in recent years, I was looking to move up to a bigger size, and a bigger set of features on a relatively limited budget.This model came along as part of an Amazon Gold Box Deal and at $599, given the reviews, I couldn't pass it up. I received my shiny new toy last week and immediately went to work getting it set up and working to my standards. I've now had the TV for five days, and I'm still getting there.Straight out of the box, the picture didn't \"wow\" me like other LEDs I've seen. Usually, despite some glaring color accuracy issues with out of the box settings, cable is relatively watchable upon first hook up. I didn't find that to be the case with the ET5. After getting my components hooked up, I quickly went to work trying to find an acceptable balance that would hold me over until my Disney WOW Calibration disk came in. I went to bed unhappy with my settings that night.After using the WOW disk, I was incredibly happy with Blu-Ray picture. Though this set makes setting Brightness and Contrast nearly impossible, I managed to get what I consider to be a brilliant and vibrant looking picture for movie playback. The ET5 does not allow for any black or white clipping, making contrast and brightness complete guesswork.For several days, I contemplated returning the TV in fear of a faulty panel. I don't consider myself overly picky to the point that I'd need ISF Calibration (in fact, this is the first TV I've ever owned that made me decide to invest in a calibration disk), but I simply could not get skin-tones to look natural. At my wits end, I contacted Panasonic and explained the situation. They quickly remarked that the TV should be up to most viewer's standards out of the box with some minor tweaking, but recommended that, in the off chance there was an issue with the white balance of the set when it was manufactured, I perform a \"hard reset\" of the TV. They gave me directions and sent me on my way. I performed the reset and, surprisingly enough, noticed a differenced immediately. After some recalibration, I've come to what I consider to be a pretty fantastic picture. Very happy overall.One of the TV's biggest highlights, quite honestly, is 3D. I was not in the market for a 3D set. I viewed it as a bonus feature at the $599 price tag. I've been blown away by how effective and crisp it is. Both native 3D content (though there's very little of it around my house so far)and 3D conversion look great. 3D-3D conversion is little more than a novelty (the TV can't quite figure out what to bring to the forefront and what to send back), it looks quite clear and adds significant depth to the picture. I've used very few 3D sets prior to this one, but I can say the quality that I've seen thus far rivals that of the Active technology found in a friend's Samsung 8000 series LED.Aside from color issues, the brunt of my headache mentioned in the title has come from audio. The TV's internal speakers leave a LOT to be desired, as is expected. Thus far, I've found them virtually unusable for any given length of time. I have heard that there are settings that significantly diminish the tinny quality and improve the overall sound, but I've yet to be able to pinpoint how to achieve that effect. My receiver (Sony HT-SS370) has not played nicely with this TV thus far, resulting in a lot of trial and (mostly) error. My receiver does not support 3D passthrough, but that has yet to be an issue. I've arranged an alternative setup for my PS3 that works well. (But for some reason, I can display 3D content from my cable box when passing through the receiver, go figure?) I think I've pinpointed the issue at this point - the ET5 seems to be too \"smart\" for its own good.The TV is reporting its audio capabilities back to my devices, thus forcing the devices to adhere to the TVs 2 channel LPCM standards. I'm having to force my cable box into passthrough the recognize Dolby Digital (which makes the TV speakers useless when I want to use them at night when going to bed), and turn off display discovery on my X-Box to force it to query the receiver for audio output rather than the TV. I'm currently seeking a method to shut off the TVs ability to override the receiver when it comes to audio, but I've yet to find a solution.Additionally, I've yet to solve my dilemma of finding a way of playing Viera Connect audio through anything other than TV speakers. With ARC enabled and connected correctly, the receiver switches inputs to TV as though it's expecting an optical output. The TV continues to output through the TV speakers.UPDATE: All of my audio troubles seemed to have resolved themselves. I'm not sure how it happened, but a quick toggle of Viera Link on and off and back on again solved all of my issues, with the exception of ARC functionality. The ET5 and my receiver simply don't agree, and so I opted for an optical audio cable for Viera Connect functionality. The receiver works flawlessly with this and handles the switching between inputs as necessary. Simple, fluid, and smooth.In way of Viera Connect, the apps seem very intuitive, relatively quick to the draw, and of overall fantastic quality (should I be able to get them to work). Netflix quickly buffered to high definition with minimal noise, and looked fantastic. The same goes for Amazon Instant Video. YouTube seems to vary in nature, but of course, much of that is relative to the source content. The remote is awful for any sort of browsing or typing, so beware. The smartphone app is too glitchy to be truly effective, though it is cool.After becoming incredible frustrated with the issues I was having, I was seriously contemplating returning the set to Amazon over the weekend. Now that I've found at least temporary work-arounds, I'm leaning toward keeping it. It just seems as though I've got a lengthy road ahead of me to get things where I want them to be. UPDATE: After isolating issues and finding news ways to solve them, I couldn't be happier with this TV. Really glad I put the time and effort in to make it a great set.Pros:-Low price for a mountain of features-Excellent 3D picture-Fun 2D-3D Conversion-Comfortable 3D glasses-Well Working Apps in Viera Connect-Solid picture (requires MUCH tinkering)Cons:-Extremely limited picture adjustment capability-Remote is clunky and ineffective for web-based apps and contentI'll continue to update this if/when any of my current issues are resolved. At $599, I will still contend that this TV was a steal.

I have found the performance of the TV to be superior -- it has required only routine tuning for our viewing desires. However, I suggest your taking a look at the more comprehensive reviews at this site for specific recommendations. Further, About.com's review by Robert Silva will provide you with a lengthy and very thorough review with many suggestions. I have not tried the 3D functions and have a copy of the 3D version of the movie HUGO on order. If I have any problems with the 3D function, I will do a followup review.", "Date": "August 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "G.

The TV walked me through the initial basic setup process the first time I turned it on; and it was very quickly & easily completed & ready for use.I found none of the issues that some negative reviewers did. There was no problem setting the options to eliminate the promo/advertising.The only thing that required some playing around was finding and using the function that sets up the 3-D conversion for certain situations One in particular was that if you want to watch a 3-D program in 2-D, it can come up as 2 separate side by side images, rather than a composite 2-D image. The solution was to it the 3-D button and then the RED button which brings up all the possible format conversion options. But this was not documented in the skimpy instruction manual. And I couldn't find it in Help or the manual I downloaded from Panasonic.Speaking of which, I understand why manufacturers pack quick start manuals & I generally love them.

I was shopping for a new TV for at least 6 months at that time. The deal was too good to pass up. I've very glad I grabbed it.I believe I purchased it over 7 months ago. I have NOT experienced any problems with it. We haven't done anything to adventurous with it though. I just set it up...connected to our WiFi...and we were good to go. I have a 3D Blu-ray connected to it now, too; but we've only used it a few times when we rented videos--no problems. I only used the 3D capabilites once. I found some free 3D content via the VIERA CONNECT apps. It worked fine.This is a great TV with great features--and 4 3D glasses are included.CON (sort of): I recall reading negative reviews on here when I was researching this TV, regarding audio issues. I noticed audio -- volume -- issues within a couple days. This isn't due to a problem with the TV. I don't know if people subscribed to digital cable and satellite, etc experience this or not; but we only subscribe to basic cable. The problem is that on some TV stations (PBS, local, and others) the volume is so low that you have to turn the volume up A LOT. PBS is the worst--we have to turn it up ALL THE WAY to hear it well. This can be a problem when you change to a different channel (like CBS), where the volume comes in loud and clear at a fairly low level. It can be a shock to your system and ear drums (and I'm not joking). It is especially problematic when you switch to the internet and use a Viera Connect app, like Tune-In radio or Shoutcast--ALWAYS turn the volume was down (around 10 to be safe) when switching to these. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

It seems like the perfect size without breaking the bank. You can really get into what ever your watching especially the 3D. Once you figure out how to get it out of the box. The directions on the box said turn. It don't turn but it does just pull out. I am refering to the 4 white plastic pieces that seperate the box. Pay no atention to the box! The box is wrong! Im jesting of course but it did take me some time to figure it out. Just reach in, pull the plastic things right out. Do not turn them as the stupid box tells you. Other than that bit of lunacy, unpacking was simple! You will need 2 people to atach the base and lift it in place. Yes the newer 240Hz refresh rate tv's are better but I am quite satified with this model. It does everything but make coffee. I'll definately buy a larger tv one day not that I need it but as far as tv's are concerned bigger is better. If I am feeling like I am apart of the show with this 55\" I can only imagine a 70\" or larger tv. This tv came out about a year ago. I waited that long to buy it at a good price. Having compared this 3D to LG and Samsung, this one blows them away. The other 2 gave me an imidiate headache. This Panasonic was the only 3D that I could watch and enjoy! Just remember that even after a year there still isn't much available on 3D. I am hopeing that more 3D DVDs become available if not 3D is a bust and a waste of money. Then again at the price I paid for this tv with 3D and compareing them with others I am quite satified with this 3D tv. Now a year ago when it was $2500, that would have been another story. Concidering a year has passed and I have just 3, 3D dvd's in my collection. Iam so glad I waited the year. If 3D becomes a total bust then I do not feel ripped off. If your looking for a 55\" led lcd tv, at this price this is the one to buy and you get 3D included. The size is great the picture is amazing. I hope you love it as much as I do. If your a techie or someone who has to have the best, then you might want a 70\", 240Hz tv. If your like me, this tv is more than enough. My only problem is turning it off. I also need to mention the CEVA did a fantastic job delivering the TV! I'm glad I bought this at Amazon rather than the big box store, just watch the pricing as Amazon is not always cheapest.

Color saturation is very good and perfect for gaming.The only downsides I observed are the 3D feature and sound volume on the TV. I'm not a big 3D fan and found it to be more of a Hollywood gimmick more than anything else. The volume of the built-in speakers on the TV could be a tad louder, but this shouldn't be much of an issue since the majority of people would probably go with a receiver+surround sound setup.All in all, this was definitely a good buy and the price was very reasonable.", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice", "Author": "Ale", "ReviewID": "R367V2GNO2FR0S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "... the 3d quality is fantastic.

When we first turned the TV on, we noticed a major improvement in video quality -- similar to going from SD to HD all over again. The picture is so crisp, clear, and bright that it was even a little distracting at first -- you felt like you were on set of the TV show. After a few days of getting used to it, though, it's no longer distracting and the picture is still impressive.The internet tv system was easy to setup and works well, although the interfaces are a bit basic. We use amazon prime and netflix, and both are usable but not as pretty and user-friendly as similar apps on Wii / AppleTV. With that said, the quality of streamed video tends to be excellent, rivaling our FIOS channels.We've watched a few 3D shows, but it's not really what we bought the TV for. Although, I'm intrigued by using the 3D capability for two-player gaming -- supposedly players can get glasses with different polarization so that they can both have a full-screen experience.The HDMI connectors are all easily accessible on the side (which is important since we have our tv shoved into a corner), and I'm very impressed by how thin the display is. One drawback is that the IR receiver for the remote control is in the front and blocked by the center-speaker of our surround-sound system.

Setup was quick, and after plugging in HDMI from cable, new blu ray and connecting new home theater, I was ready to go!First, the picture is absolutely awesome...I have not had the blooming issue read about in other reviews.  Colors are crisp and clear, and no washout from sunlight, as this sits in a very bright living room facing large windows.  My 3 year old even noticed the difference from our previous tv (Sharp 32\" lcd, about 4 years old).  2d to 3d is pretty cool...actually watched some golf and could clearly make out contours and hills!  Haven't used this much yet so it is hard to comment on it, but it seems to work well.  Streaming services work great, although the tv did not recognize my network.  Just did it manually, and no problems.  I already have netflix and amazon subscriptions, so just updated info, and good to go.  I wish they had spent more time with the web browser app, as this could be very useful.  However, the interface is ghastly.  To be used properly, i would imagine a keyboard would have to be installed.  However, i use my ipad/laptops, so not as important to me.The cons are quite minor, actually.  The tv does have ads when you turn it on, sometimes when you turn up the volume, and on the apps page.  They are quick and not obtrusive, and I guess that is the way of the world now.  It is sort of chinchy, but not a big deal.  The sd input would play my photos, but not videos from my sony camera.  Support said their codec did not support the movie file.  Again, not a game changer for me.  I wish their codec support was more broad, and it could be in the future.  If it becomes more important to me, I will just purchase a media player and plug into the usb port.More pros, now that I think of it.  I think the tv is, by itself, very attractive.  The bezel is thin and the viewing size looks bigger because of it.  Viewing angle is great, and the colors just snap!  The audio has drawn some complaints, but I guess it depends on what you are watching.  Sports, news, and normal shows are fine.  If you want deep basses and more broad sounds, get a good sound bar (which I did) and problem solved.You will not be disappointed with this tv!

Searched the internet for calibration settings and they were mildly helpful. Evidently Panasonic has changed what they allow you to modify in their calibration software as I could not find all the settings that reviewers mentioned when the TV first came out (or I'm just clueless but looked through every menu option available). Even so, using what I could find, the picture/color look great. Beware though - half the calibration settings I saw led to a horrible picture and half were spectacular. So adjust accordingly and use multiple reference sources. The screen is glossy, which helps the color and blackness in my mind, but can reflect light. So adjust your lighting to suit.The 3D has been great and performed the way I expected. I find the 3D effects are more dependent upon the movie than the TV's performance. (There are some great 3D movie reviewers on Amazon that will let you know to expect). The passive glasses are lightweight and comfortable and easily fit over my wife's glasses.Only caveat that I have is a minor one (and is typical for flat screens). The TV has side mounted HDMI ports. When plugging your cable in, they tend to sag downward (gravity is a cruel mistress!) and can lead to a poor connection or crimped line (depending on your setup). Easily fixed by making sure the cable is fully seated or a right angle adapter.Now - about the delivery. Was on my front porch when UPS delivered. Guess the fact that the box states that it is a flat screen TV (shipped in Panasonic's original packaging - no overpack) means very little to these guys. Watched the delivery guy slide the box (on its front) out of the van and then manhandle it to me. I'm sure the other guy in the truck was too busy with theoretical physics problems to help. The guy carrying the box then plopped it down in front of me (upside down!). When I asked him why he didn't use the built in hand holds, he stated \"Huh - how about that.\" Anyway, as I started to unpack the TV the styrofoam at the top corners was broken into many, many pieces. I expected the screen to be cracked, damaged panels, etc. but nope not a mark. Don't know if I was lucky or if that was good engineering.Would recommend the TV - great picture and 3D with a wide viewing angle.

From the start, it's been a frustrating experience.First, the picture on the TV, as delivered, is horrendously bad. The \"Soap Opera Effect\" overwhelms all of the picture modes.  I spent about four hours adjusting the settings until I was able to obtain a good picture.  One of the setting necessary to make the picture look right is hidden under an \"Advanced\" menu. But, eventually, I was able to get the picture to look good.  It's not as good as my Samsung TV, but, at abotu 1/3 the cost, I didn't expect it to be.Then, I noticed how bad the sound is.  And, there's no amount of fiddling with the settings that will fix it.  The small speakers are on the back of the TV.  They produce a tinny sound that echoes off the wall.  So, I had to spend an additional $200 for an amplifier/speaker system.One of the first things we watched on the TV was the 3D version of \"Men In Black 3.\"  The 3D looks really good. The TV's smaller than our Samsung, so the drop in resolution because of the passive 3D technology wasn't apparent.  The polarized glasses are light-weight and comfortable to wear - even over prescription glasses.  We had nto received the speaker system yet, so the sound was terrible. But, it looked good.The lack of real buttons on the DMP-BDT320 Blu-Ray player's remote is a real problem.  The touch pad is a stupid idea.  Do you slide your finger up one side of the touch pad to pause the movie or to make it play?  I found that you can get a replacement remote intended for the DMP-BDT220 that has buttons and works with the 320.  Another $20 I should not have had to spend ....Also, doesn't the ad copy for the ET5 say that \"one remote controls them all?\"  Well, it doesn't work.  Sometimes, while playing a Blu-Ray title, the play, pause, and other buttons at the bottom of the TV's remote will control the player.  But, there are no keys that work to select menu options or do other things on the player. Panasonic's email support has been no help.  They insist that the player cannot be controlled through the TV's remote.  That seems to be true, but it's not what they advertise.  They even have videos on YouTube demoing \"Viera Link\" which show the TV's remote being used to control many different devices including a Blu-Ray player. The TV doesn't even turn on the Blu-Ray player when it's input is selected.And, the Panasonic speaker system I bought is also supposed to support Viera Link so that it can be controlled through the TV's remote.  Well, it works ... most of the time.  About once out of every four times we turn on the TV, the speakers won't come on.  Sometimes the speakers will come on, but the TV doesn't turn off its speakers causing an echo.  It's frustrating.I still have about a week to decide if I'm going to return the TV.  I hate to have to go to the trouble, but it should work right without all this frustration and, as I said, Panasonic's support hasn't helped.", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Panasonic Viera 42 inch 3d smart LED TV", "Author": "FrankieJ", "ReviewID": "R2JIXYI09HPO9Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well first off, I was lied to.

This tv is capable of producing some pretty good 3d and really is dependent on the quailty of the content.

However I really can't see me using this option that much but it's nice to have.  Next the sound quailty, not really good out of the box and after adjusting the settings it's better. I would definitely invest in a sound bar or some type of surround sound system. Now on to the viera connect, I was a little concerned because I read mixed reviews. Let me tell you it's actually pretty good as long as you have a good Internet connection. I just hope they keep adding more apps and maybe update the browser to do flash.  All in all this is a great tv and for $850 on amazon it's a steal. My only complaint would be to Panasonic for the horrible packaging, tv was not well protected.UpdateFor whatever reason the wi-fi in this tv isn't very good. I have full strength signal but still disconnects 3 to 4 times during watching  netflix and vudu.The bad part once you lose connection the only way to get it back is to turn off the tv.

Great TV!", "Author": "RCCirio", "ReviewID": "R20U2YHPS6EX2H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this TV just right after the week after black friday sale. I am mainly using this tv as a monitor for my gaming/home theater PC. So far, I am loving the high quality display, Playing assassin's creed on this baby is pretty awesome. The TV has a game mode which reduces input lag and brightens up the screen from the standard mode. This also helps out when browsing with a mouse in Windows 7.The TV also comes with a 3D playback sensor which causes it to switch to 3d mode automatically when playing 3d bluray or stereoscopic 3d movies. This is a very nice feature, since it doesnt require the user to push the 3d button on the remote to turn on 3d mode. One thing I noticed is that 3d is a bit weaker compared to LG passive 3d tv demo at a local store. Objects doesn't pop as much as from panasonic's panel. Overall, not a bad first attempt at passive 3d tech by panasonic.One major downside is the TV speakers. It sounded tinny and hollow. It may be wise to invest on a good set of speakers or soundbar.Fedex handling of this item was horrible. The packaging looks like it was left out in the rain. There are visibe signs of impact on the outer packaging. The foam to protect the panel was badly damaged, causing me to think Amazon may have delivered a warehouse/used item. Unsurprisingly, and to my dismay, there are dents on the back of the TV panel which is absolutely unacceptable. Fortunately TV is working fine so far, but I will be keeping my out for any damage caused by mishandling. Fedex should never be allowed to handle Amazon deliveries ever.

I received my unit the following Monday. Shipping speed exceeded my expectations but Fedex handling of item was disappointing. But I'll get to that later.This, I have to admit, is my first Big, Smart, 3D TV. And I have to say, so far, I'm loving it! Well, let's break it down for you, shall we?Pros:------ Setup was a breeze and couldn't ask for easier set up. Your set will update itself and you then just follow the prompts on the screen.- Size Does Matter! At 42\"  this TV sure delivers lots of real state to feast your eyes upon. But, I think this point is rather subjective since my last TV was a measly 26\". Well, if this is your first 4+ inches TV, it sure will please!- IPS (In Plane Switching): Basically a technology that widens viewing angle. This makes a world of difference when you have a group of viewers watching a movie or something where everyone is guaranteed a sharp image no matter where they're sitting.- LED: A widely spread technology used by TV manufacturers \"which offer[s]the advantages over LCDs of reduced energy consumption, better contrast and brightness, greater color range, more rapid response to changes in scene and more accurate image rendering.\" Simply put, a better picture quality than LCD TVs at a fracture of the price for a comparable Plasma TV.- Built-In WiFi with Viera Connect suite of Apps (Applications): Having built-in WiFi means less wires, less mess. So, it detects and connects to my router real fast. No problems or connectivity issues. Content load time (although varies by a lot of factors) has been real good (5-10 seconds). Viera Connect offers a plethora of apps: Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, Hulu Plus, YouTube, Pandora, Facebook, Twitter to name a few plus a very functional Web Browser (No Flash support though).- Ports: 4 HDMI, 2 USB, 1 SD card, Ethernet, digital audio out. There may be more but those are the ones I needed to see! I have to admit, I haven't put most of those ports to a real test just yet but sure will update my review accordingly.- Active 3D is good but won't waw you! I personally don't think that 3D technology is not ready for prime time yet. I've watched the movie 300 with 3D glasses on and thought it looked alright but that was it! Two things worth mention here: If you're buying this set because it's 3D capabilities, you maybe up for a downer! I personally cannot compare it to anything prior. \"I guess it's nice to have that feature when you need it. Four pairs of glasses is very generous offering when compared to other set with similar price range. \"Active\" 3D is meant to deliver a better 3D experience.- DLNA: Potentially a technology that enables consumers to share diverse media content across multiple devices within their household or office: smartphones, printers, TVs, tablets and more. Basically, by connecting multiple compatible devices to the same WiFi network, you create a virtual local \"cloud\" enabling the exchange of a wide range of media content (photos, music, video) with ease between the connected devices. Sharing is fun :)- Remote Controller with built-in light: Sweet! Except the video navigation buttons conveniently located at the bottom do not lit up!!! Please, refer to my shared photos for this review.Cons:------ The video navigation buttons conveniently located at the bottom do not lit up!!! Please, refer to my shared photos for this review.- TV stand doesn't swivel. I guess I could list this one under my wish list. Well, great viewing angle sure makes up for it.- Screen saver is a bouncing black of grey square. Well, when you compare this smart TV to the Apple TV screen saver you'll be a bit disappointed. Some may say, I am nit picking. But, I know some manufacturers listen to their customers feedback and hopefully they'll fix this one with a firmware update.Important Notes:--------------- Some other reviewers have spoken negatively about this TV unit but you can read through their lines that may very well received lemons which a very likely possibility. I am not saying this unit is in any way perfect but I want potential buyers to filter through there readings.- Fedex has mishandled my item. As a result, I end up with a bad pixel at the bottom center of my screen. It hardly is noticeable but it doesn't feel good to spend this much of hard-earned money then get abused by the mailman. I reported that to Amazon which offers me to rerun the TV, have it exchanged, or accept a 20% discount (almost an additional $150) of its price. Amazon's customer service standards  is second to none. Please, refer to above attached photos.The Bottom Line:--------------This TV delivers a great picture quality with a comprehensive set of features. It is a great buy for anyone.

Mehring", "ReviewID": "R83LKUXDLI9NN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I want to start off by saying how happy I am with my purchase of this TV. It was an upgrade from a 32\" Phillips LCD TV from a number of years ago. The picture is so much better than the old TV. When I first popped a DVD into my upconverting DVD player it astounded me how life like the people looked on the large screen.The 2D-3D conversion is a nice feature to have. My current cable provider sends an analog signal at a mere 480i resolution and unfortunately the 2D-3D conversion for this is not the best. However, if a good Blu-ray player or upconverting DVD player is used the quality of the conversion greatly increases. While the conversion provides 3D content from any source a true 3D blu ray player with 3D blu rays is the best way to go.Now for the draw back. Here on the amazon website they say that there is a 90-day warranty. However if a pair of the provided glasses break within those 90 days it is unlikely that it will be covered by the warranty. After three uses of one of the pairs of glasses I was wearing them and went to adjust them because they had slid down my nose a little and when I pushed them up the left bow snapped off. I was not rough or violent with them at all (come on the set cost quite a bit of money!) and they still broke. After calling amazon and Panasonic multiple times I was informed that the warranty only covers products which came damaged from the factory.So long story short, if a pair of glasses break once you have used them you are out that pair of glasses. Bummer. But overall this is a great TV with a great picture quality. As an added bonus if you go to an 3D movies at the theater you could always bring home the glasses from that and they will work with this television.", "Date": "October 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love this TV", "Author": "Heidi \"Heidi\"", "ReviewID": "R1IKTD6YTWNKCT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a fantastic TV.

Much better than I expected, and four pairs of glasses are included.  2D-3D is not so great, as would be expected.

First movie on tv was die hard 4 on fx, and it looked so good. I dont even have a hd box and it looks amazing. I watched harry potter on the family channel and it looked like it was hd.  I also been playing MW3 and it looks really good but not much different from a plasma.My only complaint is that in order to use surround sound when just watching cable tv, you have to use a optical.  You cant use the standard red and white cable.  Only way around that is if you hook up your cable box to the surround system but i just got an optical cable.

I reset to the factory settings, just in case they were played with by previous customer, had no effect.  Then I remembered someone has posted their settings in one of the reviews on Amazon. I applied them, including setting the motion picture to weak and voila!  The images are crisp, the colors are brilliant.  HD looks amazing.The 3D seems to work fine when I tried a movie or a show.  Not crazy about it, plus it seems like I get headaches, so 10 minutes is the max I've tried it.  Definitely not for everyone.The sound on this TV seems less powerful than our previous Toshiba Regza, however, there are tons of different settings to be played with, and I guess I need some time to hit the right spot.  There is also the theater system when watching a program requiring a decent sound.Really upsetting is the lack of inputs for analog systems.  I'm using a DVD with Component video, WII and Playstation 2 with Composite.  In addition, I have a Media PC that also needs analog audio.  I've ordered a bunch of two-way splitters to avoid a box with a switch, however, I doubt it will give me decent quality.  Any suggestions on this topic would be appreciated.Warehouse Deals is a gamble.  My TV was described as \"good\".  The first one came in with a cracked LCD.  I'm suspecting the steel mount was loose inside the box, and caused the damage. It also could be the reason the TV was returned and never checked by Amazon.  The box was a general cardboard box for large TV's that had \"Warehouse Deals\" printed, so nothing was secured inside, except for the TV.  Amazon did not want to exchange for another TV in good condition and told me to return it.  So I did, but wanted to give it another shot, so I ordered another one.  I called and got an upgraded free 2 day shipping.  It arrived exactly when the lady said it would, seemed to work fine, edges were still wrapped in plastic.  The rear panel was a bit bent on top.  Did not seem like it was touching the circuit panel.  I was able to register the TV with Panasonic for general warranty, so it seems I will have same 1 year as any new TV.  Plus I'm contemplating whether I should buy a Square Trade warranty as well for another 4 years. I was missing all screws for the mount and a few cables, and when I mentioned this to Amazon rep, he offered to refund $121.  This was crazy not to accept, specially since I did not want to return the TV and guess whether the next one will be in working condition.  So I took the deal and bought some screws at Lowes for a couple of bucks and it all came together nicely.

Netflix was amazing on this tv via wifi by the way.Onto the bad because ultimately, what is going to sway your decision is whether or not you can live with the negative aspects of this tv.1) Youtube - This doesn't work. Very few videos on occasion work but more than 99% of the videos I tried to watch were choppy and completely unwatchable. To help you understand, it's like having a super slow internet connection. The real problem here is the software/hardware doesn't buffer and instead keeps trying to play the video. So what you have is a video playing 1 second at a time, with 3 second pauses in between as it desperately tries to buffer and play the video at the same time. It wouldn't be a problem if Panasonic forced the software to buffer for a few seconds THEN play the video.By the way, Netflix HD works perfectly fine, and plugging the TV in via ethernet didn't fix the youtube buffering issue. Also I updated the TV to the latest software as soon as I turned on the TV.2) Keyboard/Word Entry - My logitech wireless keyboard doesn't work, so I had to painfully input letters one at a time using the remote. Maybe there's a wireless keyboard out there that works with this TV but it looks like it's not compatable with my logitech.3) Red light in front of the screen - This isn't as big of a deal as the youtube issue but it's still something important to note. I have NO idea why they did this, maybe the engineers were drunk/hungover when they designed this TV. There is an extremely bright light on the bottom middle of the bezel when the TV is on. You know where most TV manufacturers put their \"Samsung\", \"LG\", \"Panasonic\" logos? Right to the left of the Panasonic logo they put a bright red light. Completely unacceptable and very annoying when watching TV.I wouldn't recommend buying this TV if you plan to watch any youtube at all, and if a bright red light in your face will bother you.

The new TV looked great out of the box, but upon viewing moving pictures, especially bright, evenly colored ones, like golf shows, a mottled shadowing was clearly revealed, most strongly across the bottom of the screen, but also extending unacceptably up the screen in bands, exactly as if the other side of the plexiglass was hand-wiped up-down, up-down all the way across, then across the bottom, with something that wasn't as clean as design specs called for. I'm betting this actually happened somehow in the process, but it's just as possible that it's some sort of shadowing in the pixels themselves. Whatever the cause, viewing light outdoor scenes is like looking thru glass that needs a better cleaning and it's certainly unacceptable in a display panel.

The phone support was great - they said it would take a week to get someone out, but the local service place called and got a guy out right away. He said he could easily see what I was talking about, but he'd bet Panny would say it was good enough, so if it wasn't good enough for me I should return it. So I am sending it back. I'm still going ahead and getting another Panny, the Panasonic VIERA TC-P50ST50 plasma (all easy because of free Prime shipping, in case it wouldn't have been included, hard to say), because its picture has gotten great reviews from places like AVSforum.com, so I have my fingers crossed now! Other than the shadowing issue, the TV looked spectacular from within about 30 degrees of straight except for some occasional irritating unexpected motion blurs, and it had the worst tincan sound I've ever heard from a tv of any price or size. I've already ordered a soundbar to allay this problem on the next panel, but that'll be sure to bring its own complications. Too bad they can't just put in a little speaker that works, or offer something simple and small that decodes their digital audio out and sounds ok and works with the TV remote's volume controls! And as I alluded, the viewing angle is nowhere near the advertised 178 degrees if you like the same brightness, as anything outside about 30 degrees from straight on is viewable but very dim and unenjoyable. Not at all what I was expecting on that point from all the IPS panel talk in other reviews.My bottom line on the TC-L55ET5:Pros: Fast delivery, great Prime service  Nice pic if there weren't strange shadowing.  Good smart functions, accessed wireless network easily, plays netflix ok, but has issues  3D works nicely with a good source.Cons: Shadowy mottles smeared across screen on bright scenes - viewing great pic thru dirty window is the effect  Viewing angle not as advertised - a killer in its own right  Sound extremely tinny  Poor quality control and support  Occasional mind-jarring motion blur on medium-speed actions throughout HDMI input types - Directv HD DVR, Roku, Wii, Sony Blu-ray  Crashed twice in 2 hours playing netflix, required restart, sometimes netflix picture extra-shadowy, other times very good other than panel's shadows, always had good internet connection with 23mbps dl capability to work withIf you buy this TV, I hope you have better luck than I did.

The setup was easy, and straight forward. Like most newer flat panel TVs, there are not any RCA connections in back, but you do get a single adapter to convert ONE component, or other older style connection to the new style. So I picked my DVD player (composite audio/video out), but that means I couldn't connect my existing surround sound system, but I expected that. I was happy at least one component was working. The four HDMI ports (and 3 USB) are great, but I haven't had time to test the USB connections yet. My laptop connects fine, and displays great too on the TV.The Web Browser option (like so many smart TVs on the market), was disappointing. I'm looking to purchase a USB wireless keyboard and try it out with the Panasonic TV. I've heard (on a Panasonic support site) that a USB wireless keyboard would be supported for the web browser, but hit and miss on most apps. The web browser DOES NOT come with, or support current Adobe Flash versions - so you can't play most video content via the browser, instead you have to use the apps, if available. So Netflix, and Hulu+ work great on the TV, since both are available via an app (as is YouTube), but you cannot access any of them (play video content) via the browser. A note about the apps, each seems to come with a different on-screen keyboard. Netflix has an excellent keyboard, while Hulu's was not so user friendly. Also Panasonic support told me the browser will NOT allow you download any content, not even to a properly connected USB flash drive. The browser did Google searches fine, but repeatedly crashed when I tried to view my Gmail account. I'm thinking this may be due to Gmail's high use of Java content, but not positive of that. Gmail, Facebook, and many other sites are high users of Java and/or Flash - so if neither of those work well in the browser you are using, the browser won't be very useful.The BIG disappointment, was the SOUND. At 100% the sound level is about where 50% is on most other TVs. My family and friends watched Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince last night - and everyone kept complaining \"Please turn the sound up?\" but it was already at the max. This isn't just an  issue with components in - it was the same on Netflix, Hulu, and regular TV channels (even with the Advanced Audio / Volume Leveler set to +7, also max for that feature). I contacted Panasonic, and they've opened a support ticket for review, but the tech told me that may just be as high as the TV can go on sound. He had me do a factory reset, but that was no help. I have an extended warranty from Sears, so I have an in-home service call set for Aug 10, 2012 to see if they can determine if this is a problem with this TV set, or the model as a whole.Also the Skype app refuses to work if you don't have a camera connected to the TV set (so you have to purchase a USB one, I assume) AND it won't let you use any Skype accounts that have more then 6 contacts. SERIOUSLY? That's ridiculous, so the app is hardly useful in any case, since virtually everyone I know has more than 6 contacts.The TV can do a 2D to 3D conversion of existing signals, but everyone who tried watching content that way said they saw little difference, and soon opted to stop using the glasses and just watch the TV normally (in 2D). For those 3D newbies (like me), you should know that Netflix and Blockbuster DO NOT carry any 3D content at this time (as of July 2012), so you'll have to go to places like Amazon.com and BUY 3D movies, but that will require a 3D Blu-Ray player, not just any Blu-Ray player will do. 3D via cable or satellite provider is up to them (I've heard a FEW provide one or two channels), but again those seem to be few and far between. So if you don't have a 3D Blu-Ray player, and some 3D media, you're like out of luck to be watching any true 3D content any time soon. As I mentioned 2D-3D conversion (at least on this TV) was lackluster at best, or totally pointless at worst.Panasonic support was user friendly, and courteous, but some times help for your given issue/problem might not be resolved quickly. No idea yet if Panasonic will come up with any ideas on this sound problem or not. I've called for service on the TV set.

I cannot find the adjustment to do so on this set.Customer Richard says:  Ben, Have you found instructions or a solution?Agent BenAaron L. says:  ;let me checkCustomer Richard says:  Ben, What have you found?Agent BenAaron L. says:  may I have the full model number of your unitCustomer Richard says:  Model number: TC-L47ET5Customer Richard says:  Ben, Have you an answer?Customer Richard says:  Come on, Ben. This should not take this long! Either you know what you are doing or can find someone who does. What is the problem??Customer Richard says:  Online live chat should not take more than 15 minutes. This is an HOUR I will not forget. Horrible Panasonic Customer Chat experience. Ben ... I take it that you are ignoring the questions. I will simply post this exchange online and email it to your company.\"There were huge gaps between this Chat Reps responses; sometimes as much as 15 minutes! After waiting and waiting, I gave up and phoned the company to find out that there's no TV set adjustment to force the digital Dolby 5.1 source signal to PCM (stereo). If you want the optical-only audio-out to work with a conventional stereo device, you'll need to purchase a compatible converter separately. They range from about $40 to $200.As to the TV itself; no question ... one of the best on the market. The unit deserves all of the stars it can get! I'd give it a 5 if it had the audio conversion feature.UPDATE - 9/24/13: Internal tuning-phase module of set has unexpectedly gone bad. Digital signal drifting like an old-fashioned analog set. Picture un-watchable. Closely packed vertical white lines slowly scrolling across the screen. Voice/picture out of sync. TV exactly one year old. TV is properly connected to a new high-end power conditioner/surge protector. I will update this review once I contact Amazon and Panasonic. Stay tuned.UPDATE - 10/11/13: My Panny TC-L47ET5 47\" LED/LCD 3D TV went out 3 days after the 1 yr warranty expired :-( To fix it in reasonable time, at Panasonic's expense, will require a month or more. The panel(s) are on indeterminable back order. So Panasonic has deamed it necessary to replace it with a new TC-L50ET60. The former units are malfunctioning at a rate that has even the latter on back order. Loved the TC-L47ET5. Now let's see how long the new silver framed 2013/14 TC-L50ET60 lasts. Don't hold your breath.

I told her i was watching a movie and when i took them off the frame snapped.  she asked where i grabbed the glasses to remove them.  i told her from the sides, she said that's why they broke.  wth?well, she couldn't send me new ones; i either had to buy them or ship them back  for verification of damage, pictures are unacceptable, at my cost.  But, she couldn't create the ticket, i had to go online and do it.  So i went online, after 45mins on the phone with her for this simple issue.the online site kicked back errors, i contacted online chat. they told me to call concierge b/c there's nothing they could do.  so i call back and get a different person.  I forget what this person says.  In the end, 7 calls, 45mins average \"care time\" there's no hold, they just take forever to \"research\" answers to your questions b/c they're poorly trained.i still have no glasses as of today.  I rec'd an email about a week ago saying the repair order was cancelled.  I called CS again.  they researched the matter, said someone would call back in 2 days.  a week later, no one called.  i called CS again, told the same thing.  I said i had reservations about going back through the same process that resulted in nothing, they assured me they'd escalate it and that i had no other options.  four days later no calls.  Called CS and this time they gave me a number to call, they couldn't transfer me.  I called the number it was a fax.  Called CS back, took them 45 mins to give me the correct number.  I don't think they liked it when i asked for an American contact number.  turns out they have only one call center in Jamaica.I need a break from Panasonic CS.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "pathetic service from Panasonic", "Author": "Devendra", "ReviewID": "R3IKYABPYA0FY0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this T.V from amazone in november 2012 and i am having hard time in dealing with Amazon and Pansoic due to follwoing1) for this T.V description amazon has written it as 120 Hz  but while this T.V arrived at the back pannel it is mentioned as 60Hz. i don't know wether its print mistake or what. i did complain to Amazon but they said they can take back the T.V but they will be able return only half of the money.2) in June 2013 it started giving trouble picture was flickering , horizontal lines were coming so we have logged a complaint tp Pansonic and dropped the T.V at thier repairing Center.now mechanic is saying that he needs a new screen pannel and for the same he has requested to panasonic but now mechanic is asking us to track the status of pannel with Pansonic because he is not getting any answer from company.from last 2 weeks we are calling to pansonic and they are saying that they are still in process of analysing the problem.don't know what to do.i will not recommend panasonic to anyone", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Viera TC-L47ET5 review", "Author": "Jim", "ReviewID": "R1UMKGZ01EAJZB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is the third Panasonic TV purchase over the past ten years.

The whole TV feels a bit 'plastic'. I do realize that modern side-lit LCD TVs are not as solid and more heavy as my current Sony Bravia, and yes, this is very subjective, but it didn't feel 'quality product' getting it out of the box.The next disappointment was the stand/mount. I mounted it properly with all the screws which was easy and fool proof enough, but it tilted slightly (and also feels a bit wobbly). I would have overcome both, but the real disappointment came when hooking it up and turning it on.The sound from the built-in speakers is horribly flat. I assume people hook it up to woofers and their stereo, but it totally pales compared to my existing Sony. I don't expect it to be the best surround ever, but I certainly don't expect it to be this bad and flat. Even with the treble fully down and the bass fully up, it still sounds like a cheap battery radio. I expect a TV to sound at minimum acceptable on the provided speakers, this TV does not, acceptable in theater setup with external audio only.Even THAT I would perhaps have overcome, but then another big disappointment is the screen. Again, compared to my Sony Bravia (with a matte / non reflective screen), the amount of reflection on this screen is really noticeable. The side lamps in my room were totally and disruptively present and reflected, (hardly to be spotted on my Sony). In the 'standard' settings the colors really are flat and 'off'. The whites are not where they should be, the green and blues blur a bit together. Setting it to 'Vivid' or the other presets will make it indeed more 'vivid' and explicit, but not more attractive. I guess if it weren't for all things added up, I might again try to calibrate and set all this to my liking, but to me it's a bad omen if the manufacturer's 'standard' is so far off from a decent picture. And again, the glare.Finally, I toyed a bit with the internet and smart TV options, while they all work as expected, the whole menu and switching back and forth feels very sluggish. Perhaps my expectations are too high, but it didn't live up anything close to what I was expecting. i didn't buy this TV for the 3D or gadgets, I want high quality picture, decent sound and good streaming options, I would say it deserves one star for the latter.Hooked my Sony Bravia back up with a sigh of relief, this one went straight back into the box and I am sending it for return ASAP. I will most likely rip my wallet open a bit further and stick to a better Sony model.", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "What?  the stupid thing plays ADS whenever you turn the volume up", "Author": "Anne E.

The price was so good that I didn't even realize that it was 3d. When it came I opened it up and my trailermate mongo was so excited he ran over to the next trailer and invited the bearded lady and the \"world's fattest man\" over to watch powerlifting in the olympics.  when they came over they brought the knife thrower and his assistant also. Too bad we only had 4 glasses so mongo and I couldn't watch with everyone else. Once the powerlifting started something came over the bearded woman and she jumped all over the \"worlds fattest man\" and they started making out on my couch. To my amazement the knife thrower and his assistant were so into the powerlifting that they didn't even seem to notice this discusting live 3d action that was going on. All of the sudden the load on the one end of the couch was too much and the legs collapsed sending the very large, hairy couple onto the floor. As they fell their glasses went flying and ended up falling on the ground and under the couple as they landed. At that point I asked the large couple to leave which they did, though not hapily. After they left mongo and I went back in the house and got ready for our beds when we were ready to turn out the light we realized that the knifethrower and his assistant were still watching the tv still engrossed in the powerlifting. All of this said I wished panasonic put a little more effort in making a sturdy set of glasses that could withstand 600 lbs of human beef flopping on them.
