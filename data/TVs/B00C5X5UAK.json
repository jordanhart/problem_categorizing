Set them up in their bedrooms and work quite well.  Picture is great and the built in speakers do the job.  One is hooked up to DirecTV and a desktop computer, both via HDMI...works awesome.  Have not tried off air or basic cable as my house is not set up for either one.  There were better deals out there on black friday, but don't like trusting all of the unknown name brands.  This is a good flat screen TV and they were $169 each on black friday.  My girls and I are very pleased.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent!!", "Author": "viper", "ReviewID": "R1W2O0DFMQVX7Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "TV arrived on time as described.

Rankin \"petsrus\"", "ReviewID": "RU3KXBZYKG6UM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought this t.v for my master bedroom. I didn't want to spend a lot. The t.v is just o.k. Color is not great, colors are dull. Picture is not great, not crisp.Volume is very poor, can't hear the t.v in the adjoining bathroom even at top volume. I spent a lot of time trying to fine tune everything but in the end it is what it is, very blah. I really should send it back but won't. It'll do for now. It's really not worth more than what I paid for it. All in all, very so so. I really can't recommend this t.v. Shipping on the other hand, was amazing. It was here less than 24 hrs. from me placing the order. Amazon never ceases to amaze me with their service and shipping.", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sound", "Author": "Kenneth Wilhelm", "ReviewID": "R3IYW6C8OGO2MF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Sound could be better.

I was worried when it first arrived as the box was ripped open mid-way down the box (center screen) including the Styrofoam packing and the microfoam sleeve protector. Fortunately it had not cut into the sticky plastic sheet protector or cracked the screen. It was shipped in only the factory box, with no thought of rough handling by warehouse/shipping personnel.", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great deal, just ok tv.", "Author": "Michael J.

There is much to be said about the brilliance, brightness and crispness of the picture, but in a kids room it hardly seems to matter.Consider for a very inexpensive second tv.
