First two months the tv started cutting out on me whenever I chose to play a game on my ps3, it even cuts out when I load in anything like a DVD or a bluray the screen will go blank like its loading but it goes longer then 20 seconds, I fixed this problem by turning off then turning it back on. I have this tv for 5 in a half months now its dead. Like the other commenter said \"nothing can be done about this\" and its true. Don't spend money on this. Save 200 more hundred then you'll probably get a more reliable led tv.", "Date": "October 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "This is a do not return item from seller!!!  must return to mfg.", "Author": "Lee A.

On 10/14/2012 -- less than 6 months after taking it out of the box -- the TV wouldn't power on. The TV was dead. Based on my experience and the other reviews here, there seems to be a pattern with this TV. Wish I had seen the reviews before I purchased what I thought was a bargain at the time. If you're shopping for a new TV, I recommend looking at another brand. You may pay more but you'll have a TV that's made to last longer than 6 months.", "Date": "November 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good TV (So Far) at a great Price", "Author": "Woodlands69", "ReviewID": "R3U7UAW1HBJSDX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV 7 months ago and have had good success so far. I read the reviews and was a bit concerned, however, for the price ($399) I decided to take a gamble. After using my first purchase for 5 months ,with no issues, I bought another one for $299 on clearance and have been using it for the past 2 month incident free. I agree, sound can be an issue, however, both TV's are connected to surround so I do not rely on the TV's speakers.Picture clarity is good.", "Date": "April 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "TV quality is the worse and their customer service sucks", "Author": "vivek", "ReviewID": "R3U5YAZBDLXDEV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you are thinking \"ohh very nice TV for cheap price\", Lemme tell you, your tv will be broke wihtin few months and you wont get your money back or even replacement.

I thought I was beating the system because I wasn't paying for a gimmicky smart tv or yellow pixel or whatever new 'critical' feature was being pushed at the time. After 13 months (1 month out of warranty), the screen was blank after power up. Researching parts shows that it may be the power board or LCD matrix controller which will cost close to $100. Next time, I'll spend the money for higher quality. Just an awful experience with Westinghouse here.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't buy a Westinghouse TV", "Author": "dad", "ReviewID": "R2C7XLBZ4M4TCU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My Westinghouse 46\" LED TV 1080p 120 hz only lasted 1 1/2 years.
