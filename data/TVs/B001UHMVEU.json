When I first saw some reviews on Cnet I was a bit concerned, even though they listed the 40B7000 as their top choice they stated some cons regarding the viewing angle and some issues they noticed with the LED's being visible sometimes. This made me decide that I would view the screens in person as opposed to just purchasing on Amazon as I intended to do and really didn't think I needed to see in person. Never the less I'm glad I did because any fear I had was immediately irrelevant once I saw the set in person. Needless to say I saw none of the issues mentioned on Cnet and the set blew me away that I couldn't wait any longer and purchased right then! I have had the set for about 2 weeks and I kick myself every time I turn it on, everything looks just AMAZING!! It is the most beautiful TV I have ever seen. My mother and 2 of my friends who were in the market for TV's came over and all of them are purchasing the same set. I plan on getting the 55'' when I move into my new house! There are so many features I haven't even been able to figure out yet. You will not be disappointed with this product. Thank you Samsung!!!", "Date": "June 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Worth Every Penny", "Author": "Dave P. \"DJP\"", "ReviewID": "RGE9JQ24DIU3O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been researching TV's for the past couple of months now. I own a samsung 26 inch hd tv thats 1080i that I got two years ago and wanted to get an upgrade. After reading numerous reviews I decided to go with an Led backlit TV over a plasma since I play a lot of video games and was worried about the burn in. I like the previous reviewer read the cnet review and was a little worried about the off-angle viewing and the variable backlighting with this most recent model of tvs.I've had this tv for about a week now and absolutely love it. The TV itself looks amazing. The stand is both sturdy and stunning. The picture quality is absolutely breathtaking. I have little to no problem with the glare. The viewing angle is extremely wide I have yet to encounter a problem and the lighting is very uniform. This tv produces the most true blacks I've seen on any TV. Images really pop out on this set. I can definitely tell the difference between this tv set and my old one.Another great feature is all the additional content the TV has. It has recipes with step by step pictures, teaches you how to stretch massage etc. I can't say enough about this tv. I highly recommend this tv especially if you own a PS3 and or blu-ray player.", "Date": "June 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Samsung LED B7000 beat the Sony XBR9 in picture quality", "Author": "Austin", "ReviewID": "R25DG635BDH2Z4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After having a Sony 27\" CRT and then moving up to a Samsung LCD LN S3296D in my bedroom I was ready to move up to a 40\" inch TV. The Samsung S3296D picture was amazing but I wanted a bigger size and 1080p picture quality vs the 720p in the Samsung.  My dad currently owns a Sony 46XBR2 and my brother a Sony 40XBR4 and every time I look at their TV's I couldn't believe how better their TV's were compared to my Samsung but yes their TV's are 1080p vs my 720p but the features and the look was better. So I decided even before I began my search that I wanted the most current Sony XBR TV. After some research I fell in love with the new Sony 40XBR9 in paper the TV is amazing 1080p, 240hz motionfow, Bravia 3 Engine video processor, 24p True Cinema and 100,000:1 dynamic ratio, much better than my current Samsung S3296D. When I walked in to my local Best buy I looked at other LCD TV's and none could match what the Sony XBR9 had until I came across the Samsung LED 46B7100. The Sony and the Samsung was right next to each other and the picture quality of the Samsung was much better the color just popped out and it almost matched all of Sony's features and inlcuded Edge LED, 4ms response time, 3,000,000:1 dynamic ratio and yes it is only 120hz vs the 240hz on the Sony but you couldn't tell at all on fast pace scenes. BB didn't carry a 40\" B7100 but I found out that Samsung made a 40B7000 that were sold by Amazon same features but the only difference was the bezel color. The price on the Samsung was less than the Sony so it didn't make sense why I would pay more for a picture that wasn't as good, so I decided to pick up the Samsung over the Sony even though I had my mind already set but sometimes you have to go with what looks better to you in person vs what is written on paper. Now both my dad and brother look at my TV and can't believe how far LCD TV's have gone in just the last 2-3 years. The Samsung LED TV is only 1.2\" thin and can connect to the internet via Samsung Linkstick and the picture quality beats any LCD TV's out at this time, I'm sure in the next few months something newer and better will come out but for now, no LCDTV can match the features and picture quality the Samsung LED B6000,B7000, B8000 in my opinion.One last thing I also purchased the Samsung 2.1 HT-WS1R sound bar as the speakers on Samsung LED aren't that good but once I connected the sound bar it didn't make a difference actually the standard speakers on the TV was louder than the sound bar and the wireless sub interfered with my wireless Wifi network so I retuned it and purchased the Sony HTC C100 and couldn't be happier. It meets my requirements and the sound is much clearer and louder than the Samsun. The Samsung looks better but in my opinion we should always go performance over looks and the Sony out performed the Samsung in the sound bar category.", "Date": "August 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great picture - no more buts !!!!", "Author": "Steven M. Antosofsky \"Steve\"", "ReviewID": "RQLJF4A4VW6IY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my first HDTV and I must say the picture is stunning. The TV appearance also looks great and has many great features. But I've noticed that when the picture background is light, that the corners are darker - like a smudged type look. I'd say this affects one square inch in each corner. Asside from this, the TV is great - but once I have noticed this I have found it annoying. I spoke to Samsung and they were very nice and they assured me the problem will be fixed. They put me in touch with a service technician and they are replacing the entire TV panel next Friday. I still am enjoying the TV very much - it has a beautiful picture - I hope the new TV panel eliminates the small problem.I got the new panel installed - and the dark corner problem is gone -The picture now is totally remarkable !!!!", "Date": "June 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "So Far Not So Good...", "Author": "Stephen Lilly \"DigitalMan\"", "ReviewID": "R1CUTXC1AN2RZZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First let me say that I have bought hundreds of items from Amazon and have not been disappointed yet.My first minor issue happened with the delivery.  I had taken off the day the set was to be delivered.  Later that day I called the delivery center and was told the set would not be delivered until the next day.  Since I did not want to take the next day off I ask if I could pick the set up.  The office was about 25 miles from me, they said yes.  Well after driving to the office it turned out they did not have my set but another company did. So after a 2 hour ride in rush hour traffic, no set.  It was finally delivered after work later the next day, so no biggy.Second not so minor issue is the set does some strange things.  First it cuts itself off and back on intermittenly.Next I have the cable box hooked to HDMI 1 with an HDMI cable, and while watching the TV it will cut to the TV cable source and start searching through the channels really fast like someone has the remote button stuck down.  Also at one point the TV was going into DEMO mode. I read in the manual how to reset to \"Home\" use and that seemed to work for awhile.I have called Samsung service and they have scheduled a service person to come out, the 3rd party company called and said the parts will take 3 - 5 days to come in.  I said no one has seen my set yet and she said that the desciption I gave apparently is so common that they know what parts to bring.At this point I just want the TV to work as designed.  I have a 55\" Samsung LCD that I have had for 18 months with no issues.For what it's worth when the TV is on, and not doing the strange things, it is great.One other thing I forgot to mention is I have this TV in the same room as my computer and I have a 26\" Samsung monitor and every time I use the remote the monitor and the TV change.  From what I can find out Samsung DOES NOT have any way to have the remotes communicate on different channels.  Kind of pain.  You would think they might consider this could be a problem.TBC..  I will update the review after the service person comes and replaces whatever parts they have.Followup:  Repair person came bearing a new \"main (the brains)\" but did not fix the issue, he has now ordered a new \"p-touch\" he calls it.. controls the buttons on the front of the TV.. side note TV is now not watchable at all since it cuts out every few seconds. TBC2..10/06/09 - Repair people called and can't get out until 10/13/09 to try to replace the \"p-touch\" part.  So this will be over a month since I bought the set and I still can't watch it - not happy!11/18/09 - Followup. TV was repaired on 10/13/09, apparently it turned out to be a loose wire connection.  No additional problems with over a month of viewing.

This really takes some getting used to, since all other TV screens we've ever watched have conditioned us to see two dimensions only. My husband absolutely loves it for viewing football games, but I prefer the non-LED Samsung version of HDTV for movies and regular programs. (I'd rate this TV a 4.5 but didn't have this option.)I also haven't linked it to my computer yet but look forward to doing so.", "Date": "September 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Slim and Sexy Samsung", "Author": "ChargeSarge \"ChargeSarge\"", "ReviewID": "R3DRYXRO6B0GOC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "On the recommendation of a relative who also purchased this TV, I researched this model and did some homework on LED-backlit LCDs. The attractive slim shape and lower energy consumption were huge pluses, as saving a few bucks a month is a good thing during this age of high electricity costs. This is my first LCD HDTV (I'm a late bloomer, I guess) as I was upgrading from a reliable (but very bulky and backbreakingly heavy) Sony 29\" WEGA CRT. I knew I wanted something light and sleek-looking (I didn't want to deal with a huge monster 61\"+ DLP system, that's for sure), and Samsung's 7000 series 40\" LED HDTV delivers in spades.For someone who moves around a lot, this TV is perfect (I can carry it easily by myself if I had to). Larger, older units are a pain to package and move, plus there's a greater chance of damage by the movers. And it just looks sexy! Friends who have dropped by have commented on just how thin it is. The picture is amazingly clear and HD programs and movies look jaw-droppingly beautiful. I haven't experienced any issues with uneven backlighting as with some reports I've read about this model, and even the built-in speakers are adequate until I can get another surround sound system (I have one for my computer, will probably get an all digital satellite 5.1 for this TV).And the price was just right as I picked this unit up for 1-6-0-0 (my budget was 2-0-0-0 max) right here on Amazon. I still haven't messed with the Internet options yet but should be doing so soon. I have hooked it up to my computer via HDMI/DVI and digital media like Blu-Ray quality movies come in crystal clear. Viewing angles aren't too much of a problem  for me as my place is relatively small. This TV is loaded with options and the menu system is very helpful in accessing things like Web content, galleries, playing music, and movies off a digital device like an external hard drive or USB flash thumb drive. Definitely huge leaps forward in making a TV that can be integrated easily with your computer, Internet, games, etc.The quality of Samsung computer monitors was indisputable as my workplace has upgraded to all new 22\" Samsungs recently, and my own office had a 32\" Samsung (non-LED) LCD TV that I was fairly impressed with. I knew I had to purchase this TV after seeing the 6000 series in action at my local Best Buy (they didn't have the right size for the 7000 series I wanted, and were more expensive than Amazon to boot). For the price, it's a great TV and truly an integral part of one's all-in-one entertainment system. If and when I ever move to a bigger place, I might consider moving my 40\" into the bedroom and upgrade to a 55\" for the living room. Samsung has done it again!", "Date": "July 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "My first HDTV", "Author": "Snik", "ReviewID": "R2HBKMXICLVJ2I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The picture quality is absolutely fantastic. I have a few things to note for would-be buyers. The buttons on the TV are kind of a pain to use. You can hardly see them and there is no tactile feedback or even a raised bump for the buttons. The internet \"widgets\" are painfully slow to load. This makes them basically useless to me. The audio out for the headphone jack is independent from the main volume control. This is nice, but it could be a bad thing if your headphones don't have a volume control. The source select on the TV is odd. Your connected device must me on before it shows up at the top of the list. But for some reason PC/DVI is always there. One last thing: you can't set the wake-up time on the TV so it turns on with a different source selected. You can only have air or cable selected. So my TV turns on with white snow, then I have to switch the source over to the cable box.Good TV overall, not perfect, amazing picture. Be careful how you set the \"Auto Motion Plus 120Hz\" because it can make some video look very weird.", "Date": "October 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "LED TV is the way to go", "Author": "Greg P. Dugi", "ReviewID": "R2DA76X0TGPXEZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We waited for years to be able to afford an LED HDTV. We needed the LED set due to health issues using normal LCD televisions.  (One of our family members is sensitive to fluorescent lighting (used as backlights in LCD) and has heart problems when exposed to these TV's).  We purchased the Samsung UN40B7000 and could not be happier with it.  LED TV uses much less power, does not generate much heat and gives off none of the radiation from the backlights found in most LCD televisions.  Our family member with the fluorescent sensitivity is now able to watch television without problems.  And, since there are no fluorescent bulbs, there is no mercury to put into the environment when the TV is beyond its useful life.This television produces very good black colors and can also be quite bright as needed.  Samsung's Anynet feature is great when using it with their other components such as their blu-ray players.  The extra content features such as Yahoo! widgets are nice add-ons.  We bundled our TV with Samsung's best blu-ray player that includes Netflix and Pandora over the internet.  We use these features all of the time.The set is attractive and very very thin.  Technically, it holds us very well against the best LCD's.We highly recommend the TV.", "Date": "September 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT!!!!!", "Author": "M.

It's an amazing tv, I'm fully satisfied. But its not LED-Backlit (It's a edge-lit led tv, the real local dimming ones are the 8000 series). This does cause a loss in image quality, and I knew this. But the features more than make up for it. I was considering this and the LG 47\" model with local dimming, but many of the local dimming tv's have their own problems, and they didn't have the style and features of the Samsung, plus the size was too big for my living room. So I ended up getting the Samsung and I've been extremely satisfied. The picture is amazing, most shows look TOO realistic, I'm actually bothered by it. It makes it look as though you're actually on the set. The speakers aren't too bad either. They're not HD, but the sound is actually quite crisp and clean if you're not too picky about all the audiophile stuff. The SRS-TruHD works alright, speakers sound just fine as long as you're not picky. If you are, and you have the cash, just buy the Soundbar accessory (way overpriced....) or a real surround sound system.", "Date": "September 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "THIS TV ROCKS MY FACE OFF!", "Author": "Jacque Strapp", "ReviewID": "R22S1PNNX6KGYY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This television is incredible.  The only regret is that I didn't buy the 46\" version, but 40\" is just fine.  I did not purchase this television off Amazon so I cannot give an opinion on the purchasing experience... but a warning: Once you have this television delivered, take it out of the box and closely inspect the outer frame of the television.  Make sure there are no cracks on it.The sound is pretty good but I do get the slight \"tinny\" sound as some reviewers claim.  But that's something good speakers will fix.  Don't make too much out of the sound as other reviewers are - it's fine on this television.Watching blu rays are nothing less than spectacular on this and yes, you will go hogwild when you watch football.  The colors are vivid and you don't have motion-blur.  I'm noticing that my set is auto-defaulting to 60hz for most shows - trying to change it in the settings but can't seem to get the full 120hz.  But it doesn't seem to matter.This television is super light and thin.  I purchased it for $1,500 during xmas week and had a major case of buyer's remorse once my credit card was swiped at the register.  I kept repeating to myself: \"starving kids in Africa, starving kids in Africa, starving kids in Africa.\"  The guilt was killing me and in this recession, I should be wiser with my money.But now, I can watch those annoying \"Save the Children\" infomercials in crisp HIGH DEF!!!This television really rocks my face off!!!", "Date": "January 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pure picture power.", "Author": "Mr. H. C. Orr", "ReviewID": "RO5U55FO7UZ76", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was persuaded to buy a B7020 for several reasons (I must emphasise this is a review of a UK B7020, which does not seem to differ in any significant regrads to this model). I already own a Samsung 40-inch A656 LCD, which I love, so going for a Samsung is as good an assurance of quality as any electronics brand. The full HD and 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio were major enticements. Seeing as I wanted to put the set on my bedroom's chest of drawers, the mere 20kg weight (including stand) and rated power output of 98W were far better than that of a 40-ich Sony Bravia Z4500 (rated at 25.5kg and 235W respectively).For my needs, the B7020 delivers. I must emphasise that I don't watch television on this set, nor am I particularly interested in sound quality. I can't respond to criticisms of the quality of TV reception for the B7020, seeing as I haven't used the set for TV, and I probably never will. But I can say that the second criticism levelled at the B7020, that of thin sound, is especially true with mono soundtracks and 2.0 stereo mixes.  I have found the sound to be sufficiently full and balanced from DVDs and Blu-ray (played through HDMI with a Pioneer BDP-320), especially when the TV's Movie sound mode is enabled.As for the picture, black levels are fantastically deep, and the 100hz settings are sufficiently varied to give enough customisation for even the fastest-moving scenes. Blu-ray films like \"Gone With The Wind\" and \"Zulu\" have amazingly dark varied palettes, and the level of picture detail provided especially in the Blu-ray format is remarkable. Of course, the picture settings of Samsung TVs are infamous for being difficult to set up, but a bit of experimentation reaps very worthwhile results (see my prefered cinema set-up, below); the annoying auto-dimming feature can also be easily turned off by accessing the engineer's menu (there are plenty of forums on the internet detailing how this can be done).Response times for games are apparently not as good as for some of the Sony models (such as the W and Z 4500s), but Game Mode is far less invasive than that for the A656 (it only ties you down to having to use Standard picture settings), and is a tool that apparently cuts response times from about 85m/s to about 25-30m/s.Another draw of this series is the amount of multimedia features. I'm not hugely interested in the InternetTV feature that the Sammy LED series boasts, but it is handy having two USB sockets to play most video formats (including AVI and MKV) as well as their attendant codecs: the menu system for this is very handy as well.Right, on to the downsides. Although the Slovakian-made set is in itself well-built, the ultra-thin build of the set has led to some irritating inconsistencies in the layout of sockets. While the front of the set is beautifully sleek, the back is a very asymmetrical affair, with all the inputs loaded onto one side. It can be tricky reaching the ethernet and component connections, especially as the TV is so light: if you have screwed the stand on yourself, make sure you have secured it VERY thoroughly, as the B7000 isn't the most stable thing in the world, especailly when trying to disconnect that awkward USB that just wont come out. And of course, the thin sound is going to be a problem for audiophiles; most irritating in this context is that there is NO headphone socket, although there are various solutions to this (see http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002KHA1J6/ref=ox_ya_oh_product).Overally, the B7020 is a fantastic, versatile creation, keeping in line with Samsung's reputation for elegance and innovation. It is designed for multimedia, style and HD performance rather than standard TV functions or audio excellence. (I must also add that the set seems to kick out remarkably little heat, even with the Power Saving feature turned off.) If you want an affordable machine for pure picture excellence and can't afford either the price or the size for a Pioneer plasma, then you could do a lot worse than this.My Movie settings.Energy saving: Off; Backlight: 2; Contrast: 95; Brightness: 55 to 60; Sharpness: 50; Colour: 50;Black level: Dark; Dynamic Contrast: Low; Cinema Mode: Auto 1; 100hz: Custom (Blur reduction and judder reduction both set at 3)", "Date": "January 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "So far so good, once I turned off Auto Motion Plus", "Author": "Dave\u2122", "ReviewID": "R1QCNO5Z18RRD9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this recently as my first HDTV and I'm highly impressed.

I couldn't believe that the picture quality could be so flawed so I did some searching on the internet and found a suggestion to turn off Auto Motion Plus 120Hz in the Picture > Picture Options menu (by default it was set to Standard). This seems to have fixed it, PHEW. The Clear setting seems OK as well. The rest of them introduce artifacts. I'm not sure what this is for, maybe sports or video games.

I am a huge tennis fan and bought it in time to see the Indian Wells ATP in California and am seeing the semi-finals as I write this review.The setup was easy once I had got my HD DVR activated and the picture was no doubt a far cry from my old 27\" workhorse (which has a decent picture). I did notice some pix-elation, particularly when the camera is near a object moving at high speed. This may not be because of the TV, but could be a result of the telecast too. I do not know. Maybe the 240 Hz refresh may have been better?The sound on the other hand leave a little to be desired. The speakers are clean, crisp, but even though I am no audiophile, it cannot match the sound of a $200-$400 sound system.But overall, I am extremely pleased with Amazon for the packaging, the delivery and the ease with which it came off the packaging and the simple install. The picture quality is breathtaking, particularly for sports, wild life and science based channels.I am World War II movie buff, and will soon be watching them once I decide on a reasonable matching Blu-Ray and sound system.", "Date": "March 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Everything is great....except.....", "Author": "Kong-chuan Tang", "ReviewID": "R3B6GE1NJCW85I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For some reason the DLNA is not fully functional.

When a completely dark scene was up the television went black (the deepest black that I have ever seen on a set).  However, when a lighter image appeared the backlighting would shift and would have a white tint around all four corners of the set.  Once I noticed this that was the only thing that I was looking for and became annoying.  I sent the television back because I have an older 46\" Samsung and had to deal with Samsung customer service which was a nightmare.  I replaced it with the LG 42SL90.  The LG is perfect.

The picture is perfect now, but the closed caption is not available for any movie and channel.(Enlish is my sencond language,I need caption for the English accent movie)I'm going to return the Monster cable and buy the cheaper one from Amazon.4)Internet@TV was easy to set up but not working until I get the Linkstick wireless LAN or Blueray DVD5)Installed my Samsung DVD with White, Red, Yellow cables: got black and white picture.

Brown", "ReviewID": "RC0F1E18BMB2A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'd been hearing about the upcoming Samsung 9000 series, with the wireless \"media box\" and the full localized LED backlighting (this one uses edge-based LED lighting).  I kept waiting on it to come out, but it was delayed repeatedly, and I finally decided to go with this one (assuming that when the 9000 came out, I'd move this one to my bedroom).Well, let's just say I feel no desire to \"upgrade\" my living room TV now.  This set is BEAUTIFUL...  even though it's not \"localized LED backlit\" I've still got so much black-to-white contrast, compared to any set I've ever seen before, that I can't imagine, right now, that I'd be able to see the difference on a better set.  If I can't tell the difference between a device and the \"better\" version... as far as I'm concerned, there IS no difference.This set is part of a complete \"home theater\" setup, including a full 7.1 speaker system (two original-release Bose 301 speakers, a set of Klipsch Quintet IIIs, and a Polk PSW505 12\" subwoofer), a Pioneer 1019 receiver, a home theater PC, plus a full range of sources (turntable, cassette, VCR, DVD-changer, Archos 5 internet media tablet, cable-company DVR, and blu-ray player).If I had a much larger living room, I might want a LARGER set, but as far as the picture quality, I'm just amazed.  Note that everything I watch on this set (in High-definition, at least) comes in through the receiver, and I'm sure that contributes some elements to the overall picture characteristics...  but I've never seen a better picture anywhere.The sound quality from the built-in speakers is better than \"fine\" but obviously not truly hi-fidelity.  The feature set is very complete (though I think I need to upgrade my \"wireless G\" uplink point to a \"wireless N\" uplink point so that I can watch movies from online...  you need a FAST connection for this to work, though all the rest of the internet-ish features work flawlessly on my \"wireless G\" connection).Note that if you want the \"internet\" features, you'll either need to connect a network cable to it, or do as I have and go wireless.  If you go wireless, you have only one choice... Samsung's PROPRIETARY \"usb dongle.\"  That's the one criticism of this set I can really make.As far as the set's cosmetics... I would have preferred it to be provided without the \"touch of color\" bezel, and instead just be the functional monitor (which would actually be a bit smaller overall).  But I'm a guy, I couldn't care less about the appearance (provide it doesn't have \"Hello Kitty\" on it or something!).  I care about how it works...  and it works magnificently.  I got it here because it was VERY affordable here...  that's what keeps me coming back to Amazon (instead of shopping at my local Best Buy or whatever).  Mind you, I'd gladly patronize my local shop, if they had the stock, and the prices, you get here.But let's just say...  I've decided to buy the smaller version (32\", 6000 series) to go into my bedroom now, and I bought that from Amazon as well.

The TV downloaded via my network and installed 1017 firmware.The 1017 not only blocked ability to revert back to 1016, but encrpyted all widgets and USB add on's like SamyGo.
