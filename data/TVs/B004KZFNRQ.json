{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great TV.", "Author": "DCfromtehburg", "ReviewID": "RK1U8WU56XTJ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went to Best Buy and hhgregg looking for a new television about a month ago. After reading many reviews on a few different televisions I had in my mind I narrowed it down to LG or SONY. I had 42\" LG before, a 32\" SONY in my bedroom and I had a roommate that uses a 50+? inch VIZIO--then I saw the SEIKI. I had never heard of the brand before and asked the people at the different stores about it and read some reviews on my phone while at the store. SEIKI 55inch LCD 1080p 120hz for $699.99...seemed a little off to me. But after reading many reviews and talking to some people I went ahead and took a risk with it. Note* I am def. not one to go off-brand with electronics.* I went ahead an purchased a 5yr warranty plan with it to be safe; SO IF THE PICTURE QUALITY or TV IS NOT TO MY STANDARDS or BREAKS WITHIN 5 YEARS I GET A NEW ONE OR THE MONEY BACK. I have heard and read that SEIKI and LG are connected somehow and that LG parts are used with SEIKI televisions, so that was a plus to hear..whether how true those statements are.Looking at the display at the store; LG, SEIKI and SONY all right beside each other (LCDs) I could not see a difference. The TV was VERY WELL packaged, lots of Styrofoam and protective coverings. The weight was about 93 lbs, too me, not too bad. I was able to handle it myself..I had too. It hooked up very easily, came with all the necessary cables and even an HDMI cable of pretty good quality.The remote is nothing fancy, pretty bland, but it has everything you need on it to operate your TV. The menus are easy to get around and understand. The factory settings on the picture settings were pretty good. I tweaked mine to my preference as any TV I own. The sound from the TV is also pretty good, better than my LG. But obv. a good home theater system is going to be better.I have noticed nothing that I do not like from this TV, after my first 2 months of owning it, besides the remote. My cable box synced up with the TV right away. The picture quality is great with the HD cable, LG Bluray and my XBOX 360. I see no problems or negative differences than what is with my LG or SONY. (Besides some different options;ex SONY has more HDMI ports, etc.) I always use the latest HIGH SPEED HDMI CABLES available also, no problems with connection/loss of picture. There is NO internet access with this TV but that is not a concern of mine while I use my 360 or Bluray to access what I'd need with the TV and have a laptop and desktop computer for the more important things.I truly believe this is a good to great TV for the brand and the price. Depending on what you are looking for in your TV should depend on what you want to buy. Other TVs may have more options in different areas, you may want an LED or 3D televison..but this is perfect for me. VIZIO started out similar with low-priced sets with good quality that greatly improved over that last couple years and I feel Seiki is going the same route.I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a TV right now, nor pay for an LED or 3D. LEDs will drop in price over the next couple years and the LCD isn't really a big picture difference to me and for what I NEED.I DO recommend this TV. I love it and I am VERY impressed thus far with the quality and picture of my purchase. If you don't want to buy an off-brand, it's understandable, but know you can get a lemon from any other manufacturer just as well. As was my first LG set, but they did replace.I hope this review helps those who read it.", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "BEWARE of SEIKI TV's !!!

Works fine with HD cable channels, don't know about the OTA stuff. My only complaint is that I'd like to see more options in the Pictures setting. But hey, it's pretty cheap for a 55\". I don't see anything wrong with it. BTW, we ended up using the default \"Movie\" picture settings with the 120Hz Low turned on. Without the 120Hz, there was a double-image with all movement. Turning that on immediately makes that disappear. Movie might be a little dark for some people, but it's better than the pixelation we saw. This TV probably doesn't have Sony-level software, but again, it's like half the price.

Very poorly constructed, the coaxial input was not attached.  I used the set for a monitor and it worked OK until I tried to hook up cable tv.  Seiki Customer service was a joke.

Then I had to send that set back, and wait again.  On the third try I received a refurbished tv as a replacement for the original.  The case was scratched, and it was last years model.

We bought a tv on February 16. By March 10 the screen had completely malfunctioned. Half of the screen works as it's supposed to and the other half is a lot darker and duller. Ok, occasionally there are duds and I'm willing to forgive that. What fuels this review is more on the part of Seiki's customer service. After nearly a month of waiting for them to update our case with our proof of purchase information (that was emailed to them the same night that they asked for it) we finally get a hold of them (they never called/emailed us back. We had to call them for updates on our case) and they tell us that we either have to put a hold on a major credit card (debit cards won't work) while they ship us a new one, or we can send in our tv and be without one for who knows how long. Not only that they say that we're responsible for shipping BOTH ways. Remind you, this tv went out less than a month after we got it. After my husband called them 4 or 5 times trying to figure out a different option they finally sent us to another department who said that they could cover shipping back to us, but we would still be out whatever the cost is for shipping a 55in tv to them. When we got so frustrated and asked for a refund instead, they told us that a refund is not an option. Our only options are to deal with a broken tv or get another one that will more than like bust in less than a year as well. When I buy a tv I expect it to work, and if for some reason it doesn't I FULLY expect the company to cover all costs associated with fixing it. There is no reason I should be penalized the additional shipping charges because I happened to have the bad luck of grabbing the dud in the bunch.", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Did not turn out well - revised recommendation", "Author": "JK8", "ReviewID": "R1B7PYYP8G4UA9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have just bought this Seiki 55\" television 2 days ago.  It was very heavy so everyone in the house had to help.  We have it hanging on a specially built presentation framework so the bottom of the tv is almost 5 feet above the floor.The tv took a while to hook up and to understand how it works, but not excessively.  We got it connected and put in a blue ray DVD and it is wonderful - fabulous - better than being at a movie theatre.  I am so glad we got this machine.  I already had a 42\" flat screen Sony but 55\" is really impressive.  It went in the den which is now the tv viewing room.  The smaller Sony is going to the living room.  And the present tv from the living room is going to the attic I think.I recommend it.  I love it.  But be aware I have only had it 2 days.  I will update the review if there are problems down the road.Update on the review above:I took it back and got a Sony 55 inch.  I could not get most of my tv stations with the Seiki.  I thought it was a defective cord.  No.  So I took it back to hhgregg where I got it.  And I got a Sony Bravia 55\" which works Perfectly with the same old cables I've had for years.  No wiggly pictures, no ghosts.  So I've got a state of the art tv set now.  Seiki is made in Korea as far as I know.  The Sony is Japanese so it was probably made in Malaysia or Indonesia.I recommend the Sony.  Seiki looks good but it didn't pan out.

We decided to get a larger tv to fit the newly redecorated living room.  After going through the set up process, I noticed that certain major network channels would periodically go black.  The remote only worked if you were standing right in front of it, and the recall button didn't work whatsoever, not to mention when you inputed a channel number you never knew which one it would take you to.  As time went on this became more and more frequent.  Finally we decided to bring it back and exchange it for another tv of the same model, as we were assured this was a random factory defect.  Once we lugged the new tv downstairs and went through the set up process again, the EXACT same issues occurred.  Needless to say the tv is the biggest piece of crap we've ever owned, and we will never purchase anything Seiki again, and will advise anyone else to do the same.

In the meantime, a hold for the cost of the TV was put on my credit card. A week later I received the TV, the box stated \"refurbished\". I connected it and it worked fine for a few days - long enough I boxed up the old one and shipped it back. After about a week, it started cutting off for a few seconds and then back on. There was no pattern, never knew when it would happen - but you could rest assured it would be at a critical moment in whatever program I was watching.

But I didn't have much money since I had only gone back to work earlier in that year. I got every Black Friday ad, including Walmart's, Best Buy and Brandsmart. Amazon didn't really have anything in my price range (which was under $200) but both Best Buy and Brandsmart had two different TV's that we in that price range.But Best Buy's Toshiba TV I found out the day before from their Electronic salesperson was only going to get 20 TV;s but Brandsmart guaranteed 100 of the Seiki TV. I too was skeptical since it was a unknown brand to me-they're website was nothing to write home about either but at $147 for a 40\" LCD HD TV, I took a chance.Since then, I've not had any issues like I've seen on here about the quality of the picture-maybe it's because this is my first HD TV but then again, I was told that there is only X amount of factories in China who make all the TV's now. The picture is sharp but my only complaint is the sound of it. I'm not sure if this is TV-related or just the type of programs out there, but my daughter's children;s programs are so much louder than the adult shows like NFL games or the cable news like Fox or CNN. But I just got a great deal on a Visio sound bar from Walmart that should solve this issue.Overall, I have no complaints about the TV; it's a bare-bones TV but at $147, I think it was a bargain compared to the others out there.
