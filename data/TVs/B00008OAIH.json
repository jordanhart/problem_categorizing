This Sony product get's 1 star because the owner can't control how many hours his children watch TV.Really, let's find a way to keep the teenagers from posting reviews on products they don't own. Or at least a way to keep the loonies from trashing an item because they have a problem with something unrelated to that item.", "Date": "March 24, 2004"}, {"Title": "Gotta Love this TV !!!", "Author": "Brian M", "ReviewID": "R2S34KQBFN6VV8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned mine for over 2 years and have never experienced any problems. The resolution is FAR superior to any other 4:3 NSTC bigscreen on the market - no jitter, no blurry horizontal lines forming the picture (even up close), super-sharp colors and no ghosts. I play Blu-rays through an S-Video input and DVD's through my XBOX360 S-Video input and the clarity and color is absolutely superb - about as near as HDTV as you can get without paying for it. I currently watch HD TV with the included up-convert box from my cable provider and it looks amazing!! All PIP functions are great too - especially the split screen that allows you to watch two things at once with no distortion - this works extremely well if you have a WebTV, video game or computer hooked up to one of the four inputs so you can surf or work on your computer or play video games and watch TV at the same time! If you don't want to invest $5000 on HDTV, but still want the best picture money can buy - buy this TV! I HIGHLY recommend it!!!", "Date": "July 21, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "53-inch rear-projection flat HDTV-ready monitor; measures 46.5 x 55.9 x 24.9 inches (W x H x D)\n3-line digital comb filter, 16:9 (enhanced) aspect ratio; 3:2 pulldown processing\nDRC Multi-Function feature doubles vertical and horizontal lines; compatible with 480i, 480p, 720p, and 1080i formats; Digital Reality Creation MultiFunction feature upconverts the analog NTSC signals to near-HD quality\n2 component-video inputs, 2 A/V inputs (1 front, 1 rear), 3 S-video inputs (1 front, 2 rear), 2 RF inputs, 1 center speaker input, and 1 monitor (rear)\nTwo 18-watt speakers with TruSurround capability", "Name": "Sony 53'' HDTV Monitor with Digital Reality Creation(TM) (kp-53hs30)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/11TFKJRTZ9L.jpg", "ProductID": "B00008OAIH"}}
