Same issue, it would not turn on anymore.  His lasted longer than mine only because it was rarely used.  In terms of hours turned on, they were probably about the same.  This company makes TERRIBLE products and DOES NOT stand behind them.I got this TV in a Black Friday sale, for $250.  That was, what, 6 weeks ago?  And it has already died.  It will not power on anymore.  Total waste of money!  It was nice while it lasted; picture was good, sound was OK (not great).  I have since found a load of complaints online about this company's awful customer service and their refusal to fix their TV's or refund your money.

The color was over-saturated and no amount of fiddling with the the settings would make them comfortable for regular movies. It makes cartoons look quite vibrant however, so maybe for a play room?The sound was mediocre on a good day.The best thing I can say about this unit is that the remote worked longer than the TV did without having to change the batteries once!I'm working with Visa to try and get some of my money back through the extended warranty benefit on the credit card, but the documentation required is reliant on first finding someone who can provide a written estimate on repairing a Coby...not having much luck with that either.If the negative reviews don't scare you off from buying the TV, try calling a few repair shops and letting them laugh when you ask about repairing anything Coby and see if that helps you reconsider.You've been warned.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "very poor", "Author": "Irish", "ReviewID": "R2Y1YD0O509VHZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this TV on black friday.

WELL for that matter, its still as amazing as the day i got it, i have had no problems with it at all, it does have a high pitched whine while in standby, but that is simply cause 99% of the population have no clue about electronics or saving money/energy. here are some tips:1. dont leave your tv on 24/72. get it an uninterruptable power supply! any high power complex electronic device can get damaged from spontaneously losing power! if you want best results, get a pure sine wave UPS, if not then get a regular one (they give out square waves). if you dont feel like getting either of those then ATLEAST add a surge protector.3. tv's are constantly using energy, so unless you add a surge protector and turn it off then its still going to be using energy. so keep it turned off whenever you are not using it.4. tv's get hot. they need proper cooling. just like computers, they have processors inside of them so they do get hot, so to prolong tv life add a fan or something.5. just dont expect such a cheap tv to be the most amazing tv in the world...", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not the great sound as reviewed but very nice picture", "Author": "Robbo", "ReviewID": "R1BT5KEXL3UOR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was influenced by the review that said the sound was great.

This TV has a good picture, decent sound, and while the stand is a little peculiar, the TV as a whole was good enough for a 40 inch TV.  What I noticed right away is that the TV would sometimes just freeze and not allow you to turn it on.  It would be unresponsive to the remote to turn the volume up and down and would have to have the power reset.  Five months of use, and now, the sound will just cut off in a program and I will have to turn it on and then off again.  The problem is not a consistent one, it just comes and goes.

Well it was cheap, and it shows it in both the picture and the sound.  Picture quality is poor, no matter how it is adjusted the picture tends to be off color, and if the scene is dark there are visible spots all over the screen.  The set does not handle dark well.  Sound quality is pretty lousy for this size, and I have had better sound on a 12 inch black and white with mono.  All in all I would not recommend this as a first set in the living room or family room.  It may be adequate for the kids in the play room, but you will be better off to spend a 100 or more and buy a TCL which I had before this one.  There is no USB port, and the rest of the ports are in the back under the cover making it very hard to add anything without pulling the TV out and tipping it over.  If you want a cheap set for the basement or the garage, this is it, but if you want something of quality, good picture and sound, skip this model.

You can do the math.I suspect this company makes money by assembling a bare-bones product which is designed only to last through the warranty period.  Once the 90 days are up, you're stuck with whatever you've got.In retrospect, I very much wish that I had paid the extra $150 for a Toshiba/LG/Samsung, or had even opted for a similarly priced 32 inch TV from a reliable brand.  I'd much rather have a smaller TV that's still working today, than be stuck with this large piece of plastic that is essentially trash now.I've learned my lesson, and will never purchase anything from this company again.", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "good TV", "Author": "GERMAN LEAL", "ReviewID": "R2GPN49EHL4SJ3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "the product is a good TV for the price. the service was fast and confident. the sound is very bad but it is not the matter, because always is true. thanks", "Date": "June 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Can't complain", "Author": "Von", "ReviewID": "R16IV7JFWQ4A3E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was skeptical about this TV because of the brand but after receiving it all of that went out the window.

I use it for a monitor and for console gaming. I have a couple issues that prevent me from giving it a 5 star review though.Pros:1) Picture quality is great. I watched a couple game trailers in 1080p and it was amazing2) Really easy to set up. The most difficult part was cleaning off a spot on my desk for it3) Lots of inputs. 3 HDMI, 1 component, 1 AV, 1 coax, and 1 VGACons:1) The sound quality is horrible2) When playing a game where it's dark, it's too dark and turning up the brightness doesn't seem to help as much as it should.3) For PC input, it only has VGA, no DVI ports. You could use HDMI if you wanted to, but no DVI.Overall, I don't regret purchasing it. It's a great deal for the priceEdit:It has now been a couple of months since I purchased this TV. I've adjusted to the darkness on most games and find that it adds to the atmosphere of the types of games I play. I also purchased a sound system, which means that the horrible sound quality on the TV is no longer an issue. I have had 0 issues with it and use it several hours every day.
