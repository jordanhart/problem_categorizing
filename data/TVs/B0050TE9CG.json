{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good TV, Not a Great PC Monitor", "Author": "pommer", "ReviewID": "R1SHQMVYF3MYLW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Wanted a light, LED TV that could also double as a pc monitor running on 12V DC power on a boat (or RV). Its light but seems solidly made. Received in good condition, one burned out pixel. TV picture is great, however as a monitor the text is not crisp, as if its out of focus.  Changed resolutions (from native) and adjusted various setting but still cant get the text as clear as other dedicated LCD monitors.  For the price though I'm not too disappointed, but I would not count on this unit as a dedicated computer monitor for long periods of time or concentrated work. The audio isn't high quality, but its fine.  This is not a high end product.  Would make a great second kitchen or bedroom TV unit, but I won't count on this much as a computer monitor.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome picture...

First ever LED TV and was awestruck at the picture quality.Cannot rate the speaker sound as I have it connected to a surround sound system.Did have trouble using the HDMI to return air broadcast television sound (ARC) to my surround sound system so I had to use the audio RCA outputs.  Still have not been able to use the ARC (Audio Return Channel) capability to my surround system though.Any advice will be appreciated!", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$279.99", "Features": "22-inch widescreen HD LED tv\nSlim LED design\nHigh definition digital ATSC TV tuner\nResolution: 1920x1080\n1080p full HD capability (optional)", "Name": "NAXA NT-2202 22-Inch Widescreen Full 1080p HD LED TV with Built-in Digital TV Tuner", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/410yuM6sFaL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0050TE9CG"}}
