I had never heard of UpStar previously, but, we were looking for a size down from a 55 inch monster in our 1 bedroom apartment. You can't beat it for less than 200 dollars. One issue is with color; it takes some tweaks to the color to not have the orange peel faces. But, otherwise, great and as expected.", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dead pixels, confusing specs.", "Author": "Adrian E. Garay", "ReviewID": "R2DA40Z6JW8NND", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Good picture, although ours came with a dead pixel right smack in the middle.  Though not distracting enough to bother us for a return, I would imagine most would not be happy if this were common.The specs are slightly misleading.  Upstar's website lists this model as having a 1080p panel, and oddly enough the television does recognize the mode displaying a MODE:1080P when fed a 1080 signal.  After much scrutiny, I've concluded It does in fact *not* support 1080p, it is actually compressed with terrible interpolation.  It will, however, allow you to play back such a signal which has to be worth something!I was hoping Amazon made a mistake listing this as 720p, but in the end I received what I paid for and am ultimately happy with the purchase at this price.", "Date": "August 1, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$224.74", "Features": "Upstar USA 32\" LED HDTV 1080P 7ms\nHDMI/HDCP/VGA Build in Hotel Menu\nPC Audio in USB headphone out put\nUltra slim light weight\nCrystal Clear Picture\nHDMI/HDCP/VGA Build in Hotel Manu", "Name": "Upstar P32EWX 32-Inch 720p 60Hz LED HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31-u7LUbA6L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CPR2234"}}
