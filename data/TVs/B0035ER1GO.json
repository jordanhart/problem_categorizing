Sadly it does.  I tested with a few pre-recorded scenes known to illustrate the problem on the KDL-26L5000.The odd ghosting problem is not the typical motion blur noticeable on fast moving objects.  This ghosting manifests as a streaking or shadow movement.  Most often it seems to affect facial features such as lips and around the eyes which seem to float off people's faces as they move from side to side.  The effect is dependent on the scene being viewed - lighting, motion etc - typically occurring in dark scenes or scenes with areas of highly contrasting light and dark areas.Happily the KDL-32EX400 does not suffer from this problem.  If you consider yourself a critical TV viewer, consider spending a little more to avoid this sort of annoying problem.  For casual viewing this is probably not an issue.", "Date": "May 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "A TV that can't handle motion well...", "Author": "J.A.

I had my 360 hooked up and character's heads would look like shooting stars when they would move across the in game environment.  Like other reviewers have stated, actor's facial features appear to be floating on their faces.  I was EXTEREMLY irritated by this.I have since returned the TV and have ordered a Panasonic L32X2, so hopefully that will answer to my TV needs! :D", "Date": "October 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Super sharp picture at a great price", "Author": "T.

Dancing with the Stars doesn't look bad either ;]Cons: the remote control suddenly died after 6 months of gentle and infrequent use. It still looks brand new. Called Sony and they said that they would send another remote to us, but if it didn't work, it might be the IR device in the TV that failed- something I find unacceptable after 6 months- if this is the case I will be pressing on them to repair or replace this set.I am a bit alarmed at some of the reviews about this TV failing right after warranty. I hope that this TV will last as long as my old JVC from 1994 that is still perfectly fine for watching DVDs but something tells me that things are built to last less and less time these days- on purpose.

N.", "ReviewID": "RAAJXG8J22Q3A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV from Best Buy about a month ago.  I was originally going to buy a 24\" LG LED monitor but they didn't have them in stock.  I then came across the 32\" LCD TV section.  Of the 5 TVs there, I found a 32\" LG to have the best picture, with this Sony coming in second.  Unfortunately, the store was also out of the 32\" LG monitors (notice a pattern here?).  I saw that this Sony was on sale from $449 to $399 and I had $150 in Best Buy giftcards, so I was excited that I was going home with 8\" more than I anticipated.I use this TV in my dorm room (it's a 115 sq ft single, so it's not very large) as a second monitor for my aluminum unibody MacBook Pro 15\" laptop.  I use it to do a great deal of schoolwork and to watch movies and tv shows in my spare time.  Since I sit about an arm-length and a half away from the TV, I turn the brightness, backlight, and picture nearly all the way down so I don't blind myself.  However, when I am watching movies, I enjoy using the \"Scene\" button on the remote to quickly switch to the pre-programmed theater like settings.  I did not even think about this option when I was originally purchasing this TV, but it is awesome.  I have been using this TV for just over a month now, and I have not had any major problems.  As far as clarity is concerned, this would definitely not be my choice of television if I was looking for something to place in a family room and use for HD cable/satellite/ blu-rays/ PS3 gaming.  In my opinion, the best way to correct for motion blur in an LCD TV is to buy a plasma.  I have not come across a single LCD TV that can oust a plasma (some may match it, but they ultimately don't beat it).  LED-LCD TVs don't really impress me because they are simply thinner and brighter than LCD TVs...  Anyways, this TV meets the purpose of serving as a dual-monitor, for school work and streaming movies & shows in a small room, perfectly.The only minor problems that I have had are from the connection between my MBPro and the TV.  I connect the Sony TV to my computer by using a DisplayPort to HDMI connector, and then by running a basic (although it has gold-plated connectors) 6-ft long HDMI wire directly into the back of the TV.  It has happened about 4-5 times that when I wake my computer from sleep that I get a Snow Screen on the Sony while the display on my computer screen works perfectly fine.  I attribute this as to a glitch in my computer's graphics card/ the Sony TV's auto-shutoff (when no input is detected) feature.  This problem is remedied by either removing and reattaching the HDMI connection in the back of the TV, removing and reattaching the HDMI connector from the DisplayPort to HDMI convertor, or by removing and reattaching the DisplayPort to HDMI convertor from my computer.  I still give this TV 5 stars because this is an extremely small deal for me.  2 weeks after buying the TV, I turned off the \"auto-shutoff\" feature and it seems to help.  So to summarize, I don't believe this occurs due to any fault of the TV.I use this TV for at least 6 hours every day to do my school work and although it can't match my MBPro's LED backlight LCD display, having this Sony as a second monitor effectively more than triples the amount of screen that I have.  Instead of mirroring the display between my computer & the Sony, I set my computer's graphics card to output at 720p (it recognizes the Sony 32\" as \"SONY TELEVISION\" and even defaults to 720p).  I had been looking forward to dual-screening for about 8 months before I purchased this TV and I can't imagine working on a desk without my laptop and my Sony KDL-32BX300.  This TV keeps me out of the library because it reliably increases my productivity in the comfort of my own dorm room.  At times I truly miss the 27\" iMac that I have at home, but by coupling my laptop with this TV, I have an even better computing experience.", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Dissapointed in Sony (purchased in mid March)", "Author": "LizO", "ReviewID": "R2IIYIDCGOLO8T", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Perhaps this is because I purchased the floor display, on sale and got an additional 10% off because it was a display model but I can only give it two stars. This replaced a failed Westinghouse (26\" 1080i LED/LCD)TV (which I will review elsewhere) and given it's a Sony, I was confident in the product.  I am, however, surprised at the low quality of a few things.I will state that for a 720 picture, the quality is pretty good considering I went from a 1080i. For that I give it a higher rating but had I to do it over again, I would have waited a week or two to replace the failed Westinghouse and purchased a Vizio. It's not as clear (true to color) as the Visio though so I knock one star off for picture qualityLet me start off with the remote.  Horrible, horrible, horrible. Sony's remotes are known to be big but this one is a monster compared to my older Sony DVD that has twice as many buttons. The toggle is awkward, to say the least and then the select button is in the center so you often end up hitting the wrong button.  I have small hands so I can imagine how this would be for men who have large hands. Then you have the options buttons (like display, tools, menu, return, scene, favorites) all surrounding the toggle button.  So very not intuitive at all. It's a cute design but not practical. Who comes up with this stuff and is it tested on real people?  Anyhow, comparing this remote to my $25 Memorex (yes you read that right) DVD player in my bedroom, the Memorex gets better points on remote design and also for size.  Seriously, Sony, go back to the drawing board and make remotes smaller and more intuitive.My biggest issue is with sound. You can not control the volume on the entire set up with just the TV remote.  I have O.T.A. broadcasts so it's important to me to be able to hit mute on my TV remote and have it also mute through my sound system (a 1991 Sony 100 Watt).  I have to use two remotes to mute my TV as it continually feeds through my stereo no matter what option I have tried. I had better sound control on my Insignia digital converter remote (which did mute the sound through the stereo too) than I do with this Sony. My failed Westinghouse HDTV even allowed me to mute via the remote.  I would have expected it to be the other way around.So, this inability to control the sound directly via my TV has led to an issue with the \"Steady Sound\", which is geared to make the sound across all channels and the sometimes commercials that aren't supposed to be louder but are.  The \"Steady Sound\" absolutely does not work.  So, when changing to a channel I know has higher/louder sound, I have to mess around with two remotes. Or when a TV station has commercials that are louder (against the FTC rules but they have them anyway) again, I have to mess with two remotes and it shouldn't be that way. This gets really annoying.I have looked on their message boards and keep checking to see if there's a firmware update and I have not seen any resolve to this sound issue. Messing with customer service anymore (with any company) seems to net frustration on my end so I am not even going that route at this time. The sound issue should be a non-issue from the get-go IMO.I probably will not buy another Sony TV in the near future. As soon as I am able to afford a Visio (which I have been skeptical of because their company is relatively new compared to the old standbys like JVC, Sony, Panasonic) 37\", LED I am getting rid of this one. I have a Visio VIA 22\" LED 1080i and find I am watching TV and movies more on that one than I ever do on this Sony. I never thought I would write a bad review of a Sony product, but there you go. Had the Westinghouse not pooped out on me (it just died on me) I would have been more than happy to keep the smaller TV size and kept the extra cash I spent on this Sony to upgrade to a Visio at a later point.", "Date": "June 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome Television", "Author": "Ron", "ReviewID": "R25G09AWOHLMJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Clear and precise, but where it really shines is the on-screen menus and displays - well designed and not overwhelming on the television.", "Date": "January 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love this TV!", "Author": "Brandon Guenther", "ReviewID": "RZ6COI8849B3R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this TV for about a year and a half, and couldn't be happier with it.

I felt uncomfortable returning the first two TVs, but I'm glad I did, because I ended up with a high-quality, problem-free TV in the end.  The experience also gave me some good insight to write this review.The problem with the Sony BRAVIA BX 300 Series (model KDL-32BX300) was, when I connected a DVD player with composite video cables (red/white/yellow), and played a DVD, there were alternating horizontal stripes of discoloration on the screen.  These stripes appeared on some DVDs, but not all.  The stripes of discoloration were most visible in scenes with a lot of blue, for example; blue sky scenes, and the stripes alternated yellow and blue about every half inch in the sky.  I did a lot of troubleshooting, including plugging the TV and the DVD player directly into the wall outlet, and disconnecting the TV cable (to ensure there was no signal interference from the TV cable or a surge protector).  I also connected a second brand of DVD player to the TV with the composite video cables, and also saw the stripes of discoloration.  Both of these DVD players worked perfectly in the other two TVs in our house (one a Panasonic plasma, and the other a tube TV).  Aside from the video input problems, the picture quality of the KDL-32BX300 with a cable signal was grainy, and the lowest quality of the three new TVs that I bought this week compared.  Also, the remote was cheap, and the menu layouts were poor.When I called Sony customer support, the representative was rude, and told me that since the stripes didn't appear with a cable signal, then the problem was with the DVD players.  After I explained to him that the two DVD players worked perfectly in two other TVs, including a one-year-old plasma, so it must be a problem with the video inputs, he said just return the TV to the retailer.The other TV that I returned for this same problem was a Visio VO320E.  I tried two different DVD players in the Visio, one with a composite cable connection, and one with an S-video connection (the Sony didn't have an S-video input), and the stripes of discoloration were visible with both DVD players.  The picture quality was better on the Visio VO320E than on the Sony.The third TV I bought was a Panasonic TC-L32X2.  This TV just came on the market in March 2010.  What a relief to find that the DVD video inputs didn't induce any stripes of discoloration on the screen.  Better yet, the picture quality from both the DVD and cable inputs were far sharper than the other two TVs!One thing I think I can conclude from this experience is that manufacturers of the Sony and Visio TVs are the same, or the defective video inputs came from the same manufacturer.", "Date": "March 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent picture, superb sound.
