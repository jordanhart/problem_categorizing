If you search you'll find this is a common problem with the HP's.  When it worked it was fine.  It had good resolution and color.  It also had the usual burn in issues on the sides from commercials.I had this TV in a apartment that I only used on weekends and it died in 20 months.  That equates to 6 months of normal viewing. I will not purchase another HP.", "Date": "December 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware", "Author": "J.M.Dee", "ReviewID": "R1C3DBWIIMK3NC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've had a HP 42 inch Plasma TV for 3 years and it has been a wonderful picture with vibrant colors but a few weeks ago the picture faded and started flickering and no amount of adjusting  would fix it.That is when the problems began, it was impossible to find a HP authorized repair service anywhere in my area in Northern California .  No other repair service would touch it citing that HP would not sell the parts or give them any repair manuals.I called HP for help and got someone from India who was  very polite but almost impossible to understand. I was told that for $685 a technician would be sent to my house and then parts would be ordered and the TV fixed. The TV would only be  warrantied for 90 days.I told him that for $685 I could go to Costco and buy another Plasma TV, which  I did that same day so be aware that even though I think the HP is a cut above the others in quality one day sooner or later it will bite the dust and then your problems will begin.Needless to say I am extremely disappointed with HP, I have bought and used lots of their products over the years, even now  I have a HP scanner and printer but it's the end of line for HP, I will never buy another one of their products.", "Date": "April 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "HP PL4272N", "Author": "C. Bridgen \"coolin02\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZOS1XWHIBRBA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is an excellent TV for someone looking for an HD picture at a good price. This TV was ahead of its time coming out of the box with 3 HDMI inputs, 2 component inputs, a PC input, 2 composite video inputs, and 10,000:1 Contrast Ratio. Its maximum resolution is 1080i, so it is unable to see the best 1080P high definition picture, but shows an excellent HD picture. I have owned my TV for a year and a half now and it has been excellent. I play video games on it, use it as a PC monitor and watch tons of movies and regular TV programs. The HD cable picture is excellent. As for the burn-in. Red is the hottest color in your TV and plasma TV's in general are WAY more susceptible to burn-in, especially the color red. People don't realize that surge protection is one of the most important keys to protecting your new HD television. If you're worried about your TV lasting...Calibration, the fine tuning of your picture settings through the service menu, will help to add on to the quality of your picture, the life of your TV, and the overall performance and efficiency of the unit. PUT A SURGE PROTECTOR ON YOUR TV IF YOU WANT IT TO LAST!!!", "Date": "April 29, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "1024 x 768 pixel resolution\n3D Digital Comb Filter\n10,000:1 contrast\nHP Virtual Surround audio processing, Dolby Digital 5.1 optical digital output\nFilm Mode processing (3:2 Pull Down)", "Name": "Hewlett Packard PL4272N 42-inch Plasma Flat Panel HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417mJxv4aGL.jpg", "ProductID": "B000SLUP56"}}
