Worse than that, the viewing angle is so limited that moving your eyes off axis just a foot or two (whether up or down or side to side) will cause the picture to go negative like it was shot in infrared.  To add insult to injury, the included stand is not capable of tilting to a downward angle, so you can't place the TV higher than your eye level without getting the \"negative\" effect.But the real insult is that the TV will NOT respond to any other manufacturer's remote control.  If you've got a Verizon Set Top Box, there is no way to control the Coby with your Verizon remote.  None of the remote codes work.  Do a Google search on \"Coby TV\" and \"Remote Code\" and you'll learn what I wish I'd known before I bought this cheap piece of junk.  You're stuck with using the ugly little grey remote that came with the Coby and if you lose that then you're screwed.  If you have a STB, that means it takes two different remotes to turn your TV on and off and control its volume, while your STB remote changes channels.  How retro is that?So don't be penny foolish.  Cough up the extra dough and buy a better TV than this COBY.", "Date": "May 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Bad Viewing with Audio Delay", "Author": "BSwine", "ReviewID": "R1TUG54KWS7DJJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this for the kitchen and never dreamed that this TV could be so bad.  The shiny black screen reflects every window and light in the room (almost as good as a mirror).The viewing angle is just bad.  Side to side you only get about 50-60 degrees.  This would be ok if you hide this in a corner, but I have it in the center of wall.  In about 80% of my kitchen the picture is inverted or not viewable.  Even worse is the vertical viewing angle.  I have tilted the screen down as far as it will go and if you sit at the table, then the screen is not visible.Most of my problem with this TV is with the audio video alignment problems.  Not noticeable at first, but over time it started to bug me.  I finally figured out that the audio was about 1/10th behind the video.  This was not every channel, not all of the time.  It would come and go.  As I started to pay attention to this problem, I noticed that audio could be as much as a 1/4 second either before the video or behind the video.  Most noticeable on the big network's digital broadcast (they are using 1920x1080i or 720x480i).  I have other digital signal converters and dvd recorders that do not have these delay problems.This has been returned as a defective unit, but I think that Coby just used cheap electronics.

The main complaint, other than the poor picture quality (I expected that with this brand and cost), is that if you live in a rural area, and if you can only rely on antenna, you are doomed with this machine.As people use antenna may know, each channel has it's own antenna angles. That is, you switch the channel and adjust the antenna. With this TV, it only accepts pre-scanned channels. That is, it scans the whole spectrum with one antenna orientation, save the channels and done. Yes, it is convenient. But after that, you cannot do anything to it. You cannot \"enter\" a channel (such as 7.1) when the channel number is not previously saved. You cannot try to adjust the antenna to tune in a channel that is not previously saved first. HOW STUPID IS THAT?But if you have cable service and want to take this one, yes, you can. But for anyone in our situation, please, try something else. Our Sony is much better to allow us enter any channel number we want and it tries to tune in.

I researched a lot of TVs and read many reviews before purchasing this brand, and knew what to expect. This TV replaced an 8-inch tube TV. The Coby was easy to set up to run on cable and easy to customize. What I like is the cable and cord attachments are on the backside so cord and cable don't jut out from the side, and the TV is wall-mountable.  We watch TV from two areas in the kitchen and purchased a wall mount that swivels and tilts, which helps maintain good viewing angles whether standing or sitting. Picture quality and sound are okay for my viewing needs in the kitchen.

Likewise, if I tried to match the contrast/brightness to the nearby TV's, it was nearly impossible. If you see haze, start over. Bad lighting, harsh lighting really looks terrible on close-ups of faces.

Like one of the reviewers says that when you look at it at certain angles it gives you sort of an x-ray appearance to the people on the screen. Also, I don't know about not being able to use any other remote control with this tv as I have set this up in my bathroom and borrowed from my comcast cable box around the corner in my bedroom.  I have to leave the coby on channel 3 and use the comcast remote control to change the channel in the bedroom.  You have to view the same channel as in the bedroom in the bathroom.  Which is okay because I can shut the tv off in my bedroom after I pick the channel I want to watch in the bathroom while bathing.", "Date": "December 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "We're very satisfied", "Author": "J&M;", "ReviewID": "R32QT8IDD63EAT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We're very happy with the Coby 15\" wide screen t.v.

Delivery was swift, and the TV was in perfect condition. To help you, here's some pros and cons:Pros:  * Supports all common video connections (Coax, RCA composite, S-Video, RCA component, HDMI, and VGA)  * Excellent picture quality  * Good horizontal viewing angles  * Very elegant glossy-black cabinet  * Surprisingly lightweightCons:  * Channels must be found during auto-scan  * Vertical viewing angles aren't so good  * Made of cheap-feeling plastic  * Dark colors on TV shows are grainyAlthough it has some caveats, this is an excellent HDTV for the price, and I would probably recommend it to anyone looking for a small HDTV.--EDIT--Today I decided to try and use my Coby as a second monitor for my computer. Works really well, actually. I wouldn't want to use it as my primary monitor, because it's not quite as bright or sharp as my 19\" Samsung monitor. But for a second monitor, it works perfectly for what I need. :)This TV isn't exactly optimized for use as a monitor, so after a bit of trial-and-error, I've found that these are, in my opinion, the best picture settings to use. Go into the menu and change the Picture settings to the following:Picture Mode: PersonalContrast: 65Brightness: 65Sharpness: 12Color Temp.: NormalI've been testing this over HDMI, if it makes a difference. My main monitor is using the one and only DVI-VGA adapter I have, so I have to use the DVI-HDMI adapter for this.
