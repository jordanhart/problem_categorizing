{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good picture quality, but no TV audio output", "Author": "DAVID A MILLER", "ReviewID": "RGJJ1ZZT2BV2T", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have owned this unit for about a year now.  The picture quality is excellent and there are plenty of ways to hookup other components to the TV, even from the side.  But the two grips I have about this unit is1.  There is no way to hookup the TV to your receiver to hear sound from the TV to the audio receiver. There are plenty of audio inputs BUT NO OUTPUT.  I have checked and asked but this is not an option on this unit.  I did not desire this function when I bought it and did not notice that it was without this option, but after hooking a DVD player and receiver, I wish I did.2.  A few times and for no reason at all, the volume will turn off.  It doesn't indicate \"Mute\" or anything, the sound just goes off.  At first I thought some how the mute button was pushed, eventhough I was no where near the remote.  When trying to release the Mute using the remote nothing happens, the only way to get the sound back is to turn the TV power off then back on.I suppose Polaroid is new to the HD TV market and needs to do a little bit more improvement to compete with the other brands.", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Dual ambient light sensors\nPower save\nPicture-in-Picture\nVESA compliant", "Name": "42IN Ws LCD 1920X1080 1000:1 1080P MDT421S HDmi Dvi-d 9MS", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/311sW8AnSbL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002QPY7GK"}}
