{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Basic HDTV", "Author": "K.K \"Power User\"", "ReviewID": "R2QE721DKCISAI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "To give a balanced review of this TV, I am sharing my experience with this entry level flat screen LED non-smart TV. 1080p 60Hz. The other reviewer probably got a defective TV and it's fair to return it.Like me, if you are looking for a decent, entry level LED-backlit TV, for cheap, this one is for you.  It is very clear, crisp and bright even at 50% brightness and contrast.  JVC is known for sound.  And JVC touted this TV to have good sound.  Not so true.  The sound is more decent than other TV in its class/price range.  But it is no hi-fi system if you are looking for one.  Using a 15 year old RCA amplified antenna, I caught all on-the-air channels in my area - my TV is located in the bedroom upstairs. The TV has a decent thinness at 2.5\".  Not svelte but not bad either.  the bezel is also respectable at 0.5\".  Again, not the top of the line, but not bad for the price (under $300 at this writing).There's no wifi, no web browser, Youtube, Hulu, nor Netflix.  But I don't need any of these for the purpose of this TV and don't want to pay for them.  Besides, it's a pain to \"type\" a web address on to a TV web browser.  Off the air, TV stations broadcast 480i, 720i/p, 1080i only.  So I hooked it up to a blu-ray player to see if 1080p works better.  It was very clear and bright.This TV has 2 HDMI, one USB, Component and Composite ports. For 39\" and above, I would suggest you not to settle for anything less than 1080p.  I think 39\" is the largest size you can settle for 60Hz.  I watched a couple of football games and did not see any blurring effect. However, you will be better off with 120Hz when you start to go beyond 39\".  Just in case you are interested, you can make a non-smart TV smarter than smart TV by using Chromecast or the likes. (Chromecast is the least understood great device that marries your smart phone, tablets, laptop to your non-smart TV, but this is another different topic/review).The menu is simple and clear.  One thing I would love for JVC engineer to change is the \"check boxes\" in Channel Management menu.  For whatever peculiar reasons, JVC engineers designed the checked boxes to be smaller with light blue color in place of a check mark.  This makes it hard to see what is checked and what is not checked.  Another HDMI port would be nice.All in all, this TV is what I need for low price.  If all you need is a decent TV of decent size, at a decent price to watch some news and occasional DVD/Bluray discs, This will fit this need.  If you want 4K, or 3D, or Wifi, or internet features, this is not for you. But you for sure will pay more for a decent brand.One last thought, for LED TV, brands matter.  The bigger the companies, the more chances they have better advanced technology that makes your viewing experience pleasant.  Occasionally, you will run across unknown brands with many bells and whistles for very cheap, I would suggest you give them a chance, but be ready to return the TV.  This is the privilege of being a consumer in the US (and other places too, but I only know the US consumer rights.)Hope this helps.  Enjoy your TV once you find what you like.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not up to prior standard", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3T2Z02XA0Q4FG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought the JVC 39 inch tv at Walmart for $299.00.
