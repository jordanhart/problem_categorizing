{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great little TV", "Author": "scouter99", "ReviewID": "R2IR2DBHA83LVM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV for our workout room and it is perfect for that!  We have it mounted up very high on the wall and I can see the picture perfectly during my entire workout (I move around the room a lot).  I do notice when I am closer to the TV and looking at it at a more extreme upward angle (like when I am laying on a weight bench at more of a side lower angle) that the picture on the screen is harder to see.  For what I am doing with this TV that is no problem.  I also can't comment much on the sound quality because I have speakers hooked up to it... and with those sound is excellent!For the price I am THRILLED with this TV!!", "Date": "April 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Use for digital photo frame limited", "Author": "Joey Marie Bramlage", "ReviewID": "R3O538CTCR0QDV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been searching for a TV with a working USB port for use as a large digital photo frame.First of all, as at TV it works fine, although it is a little quiet, as others have mentioned.As for my primary reason for buying it, to use as a digital photo frame, it leaves much to be desired. They seem to have intended that it might be used for this purpose since they included the ability to choose how long each photo remains on screen during a slideshow and transitions to get from one photo to the next, but there are serious limitations. It doesn't recognize all USB drives. It also doesn't recognize all photo types, only jpgs. There seems to be a limit on how many pictures you can load per USB drive (I think 200)... annoying, although had I know this ahead of time I'd just have bought several smaller USB drives and labeled each by album. There appears to be the ability to navigate into different folders on the USB drive, but I was never able to make this work. There is no \"shuffle\" feature so you have to view the photos in order. This is particularly annoying since it's quite difficult (although possible) to scroll through photos and start in the middle of the photos. When it reaches the end, even if you started in the middle, it just stops, doesn't restart at the beginning of the queue of photos. I find it odd that it will not show short video clips from the USB drive... it's a TV so I thought this would be a given. Supposedly it can play music files, even while viewing photos, but I didn't try this and don't know whether it would move from one song to the next or replay the same song again or just stop playing at the end of the song (probably just stop).All of these problems could be resolved with a relatively simple firmware update and I'm really hoping this will happen, although it seems unlikely. Still, if they did this it would open up a whole new use for this TV so I'm still hopeful they'll see the potential for increased sales and do it.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worst TV ever", "Author": "km", "ReviewID": "R1P1YDK9O95BWA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Worst TV with exceptionally bad picture quality.
