I returned it for the 19\" Sanyo LCD model.Installation was fast and easy. Take it out of the box, plug it in, attach antenna, power on, and the set detects the type of antenna connection and off it goes scanning for TV stations without further ado.It even comes with a manual.The remote is uncluttered and  simple to use. I was comfortable with it very quickly.The digital pictures are crisp clear and a pleasure to watch. The analog pictures were not that good, but that depends on your antenna and location. I used a table top powered antenna from Radio Shack that works fine.I gave the TV a four star rating because I have not had it long enough to give a full evaluation. I wrote this simply because there were no other evaluations, and I want to provide at least some feed back for those that are considering this product.", "Date": "October 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Perfect for Dorm Room", "Author": "F. J. Procaccini", "ReviewID": "R1LADPJHPJ7312", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have this TV in my small dorm room and it is perfect.  The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the sound quality isn't the best but what can you expect in this small package.  My xbox 360 looks amazing on it with the HD inputs.  The price isn't bad either.  It's easy to move around and fit in small places.  Definitely recommended for a college student, trust me, I am one.", "Date": "March 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Love It", "Author": "K. Hinton \"starrynight\"", "ReviewID": "R3HL203K5DJSOP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this TV at Wal-Mart, for the bedroom.  The first one lasted a week and then quit working on me.  Did a few funny things and then just stopped responding.Customer Service was very helpful, though, and told me to take it back to the store and exchange it.  Wal-Mart was also very helpful, they exchanged the tv with no problem.Both the day I bought it and the day I exchanged it, I noticed that these tv's were just \"walking\" out of the store.  They seem to be very popular.The picture is very clear, crisp, and bright.  The audio is great.  I like that I can hook up my computer if I want.  The television is easy to set up, easy to use, easy to move, and light (I could move it while I was eight months pregnant).", "Date": "December 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "My last Sanyo product", "Author": "G. Miller", "ReviewID": "RR6PC6JEYYA7C", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This makes the third Sanyo product I have owned and will definitely be my last.  I bought this TV for the kitchen to replace a 13\" GE TV/VCR and this TV appealed to me because it not only had a larger screen but also because it could fit in the same place the 13\" TV had before it.  At first everything went great.  I had no problems hooking the TV up and searching for programming.  Then a few weeks later the unit reset itself and all channels were deleted.  I found it rather odd and just had it auto search for programming again.  It worked fine for a few more days when it reset itself to the factory settings yet again.  This was getting to be a bit annoying but I reprogrammed it yet again.  Around the same time I also noticed a stuck pixel on the right hand side of the screen.  It isn't noticeable when I'm watching the TV but when the screen is black there's this highly noticeable fuchsia  dot on the screen.  I called Sanyo and the support rep said he would call back with a list of places in my area that can repair the TV.  That has been roughly 3 months ago and I'm yet to get that call.In conclusion, this TV is not worth the price with the quality of the product and the quality of customer support offered by Sanyo.  I will be replacing this unit as soon as possible.", "Date": "March 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "doesnt work after only 2 years", "Author": "meg \"meg\"", "ReviewID": "RDD9VZTSROPYF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this tv WORKED great. yes I needed to shout that. came home today after work and went to turn it on and nothing, makes a quick flash and nothing. Funny thing is it worked fine this morning before I left for work. So I would not buy this tv, unless you get an extended warranty and then have it replaced, or just get reimbursed. I purchased this tv 2 years ago when it was new, at walmart. Should have got that extended warranty, also should've listen to the hearsay about Sanyo. junk. booo", "Date": "November 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Really Great Hdtv the picture quality is beautiful", "Author": "Time", "ReviewID": "R1DR588Z6UT8LF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this tv from walmart on friday the 7th of january 2011 i was actually going to buy another tv i think acer but instead say this and i think i was going to also buy another tv but i mean when something is meant to be \"God\" will let you know so i pick this up from walmart except the model DP19640 the thing i like the most about this tv is that you can use it has a computer monitor using the vga port or you can switch to tv and watch cable tv or you can play video games on it i have the new xbox slim 4gb and i bought an hdmi cable from here amazon cheap almost 5 dollars and hook it to this tv with my xbox man the picture is incredible and the sound i mean this is hdtv to the maximum i mean the picture clarity is really great even when watching tv i get digit channels from my cable network free this is a great tv you can save money by using it as a computer monitor,watch tv,switch to hdmi for your xbox 360 or ps3 and component cable this is a great tv plus its 19 inch too so you can move it about easily this is a great tv i would definetly recommand and get a new one too if i had too the same exact brand nothing different same size everything.

I bought it at Walmart after studying all the 19\" TVs there carefully. There is a cheaper model, but it looks BAD. All fuzzy. This is the second cheapest there and looks so much better. Picture is clear, screen light is good though a bit darker than the others. Light to carry too, only 8 pounds. I brought it home and it looks better yet in my house!Setup is very simple. You snap on the base, screw in two screws, plug in power cord. I then connected the DVD player to it and played movies. Looks good. It does have the option of controlling screen size, that is, you can play stuff with full screen or wide screen. (Some people don't bother with this, so their TV pictures look stretched.)Now my son is playing Xbox on it, and the picture looks great! much better than it does on my old CRT 19\" TV (even though that one isn't bad). The speakers sound rather decent too.Anyway, my son is very happy, and so am I!", "Date": "April 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "great tv", "Author": "Paul Croasdale", "ReviewID": "R6VOBMDSZBS3M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this tv for use in my dorm room. great picture, great sound, and easy hook-up to all my dvd inputs and sound outputs.All around great product, especially for someone on a budget.", "Date": "March 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Worked Great for me", "Author": "Ttf \"Book Collector\"", "ReviewID": "R1US51VP2TLA4U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Maybe I should have given it A four-star rating, but i've had this TV for 5 years. it was a return item from walmart so it was hugely discounted.

(In fact, abt. half of the channels that have been detected on this TV don't put out any visuals or audios....)Also, the skin tone of the people appearing on most channels appear too reddish even when I set the TV's Tint feature all the way to the end of the Greenish Tint's side, & the skin tones of the people on a same program sometimes fluctuate quite a bit depending on the cameras used....Also, some of the buttons on the TV's remote just don't respond until I press'em harder than I'm used to with any button on any other remote that I've ever used in my lifetime, & bcs. the channel & vol. control buttons have raised <, >, ... type symbols on the buttons themselves, the buttons just don't feel smooth like those on any other remote....", "Date": "August 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "T.v. didn't work!
