Ordered last sunday, delivery was one week later. Having the option of sunday delivery was great, and the delivery was very professional and definitely white glove.Two people brought the TV in (carrying properly as this is a plasma), opened the box, put the TV on the stand, powered the TV on and waited for me to check whether there is any problem with the TV. They also offered to remove packaging if I wanted to get rid of it. Sometimes you cannot even get such good service when you pay $100+ for shipping. Given that shipping was free, I was thrilled.TV is awesome, right out of the box. It looks great, works great. Picture is top notch. I put in an HD-DVD version of Transformers and was amazed at the picture quality. This is my first plasma TV and I believe it is much better than LCD. I had a Samsung 4061F before, and this TV has better picture than that one, despite the Samsung being 1080P and this being 720P. There's no motion blur whatsoever on this TV.Checking on the web a little, I made the settings to be: pic mode custom, contrast +78, brightness +57, color +53, tint -9, sharpness +29, everything else off, black levels light and temp normal.  These settings turned out to be perfect for the TV.Five stars for the TV, purchasing experience and the delivery service.", "Date": "April 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Much better than LCD!", "Author": "B.

Sony Bravia LCD (less than 1 year old and it is a 1080P), Sony HD Cineza (1080i) in my theater room, Panasonic Plasma EDTV (about 9 years old which I pay a lot of money for it when Plasma first came out) and the newly purchased Panasonic VIERA X1 Series TC-P42X1 (720P).  I can tell you that this Plasma is much better than the $1499 Sony Bravia LCD 1080P.  The picture is super clear even just connect it with cable and Satellite.  DVD is incredible and you do not need a Blue-Ray player becasue regular DVD is just as good as Blue-Ray on this one.  I have all the technologies, cable/DirecTV, Toshiba HD-DVD player, Sony PS3 Blue-Ray, DVD recorder all connected to this set.  So far this is the best $800 plasma you can buy.  My old Panasonic Plasma which just was an Enhanced Definition and it is about 10 years now and the picture is still looking good.  I never had any problem with Panasonic TV and it is a better brand in Japan than Sony.  Go get one, you will be pleased!P.S.  The sound quality on this set is also above what other brands can offer.

Did I want LCD or Plasma? 50\" or 40\"? Panasonic, Sony, or Samsung? Etc etc. I even went to a couple stores and looked at them, that only helped to further confuse the situation.So after lots of reading online and researching specifics like 720p vs 1080p and LCD vs Plasma, I decided to go with this one. Between the customer reviews, the specs, and the price....I couldn't find anything better.The color is absolutely perfect! The 42\" screen is exactly the right size for my room (couch is about 8-10ft away and its mounted above the fireplace). I mainly watch movies or play xbox 360, and I really had a hard time finding reviews on TV's from people with 360's. I just want to clarify that all my games look awesome! COD4, COD5, Assassin's creed, Fallout 3, all of them look incredible. The only issue is that some times it judders the picture. Not often, and not enough for me to worry, but it does happen once and awhile.I hooked this TV up to a Onkyo 7.1 surround sound system, and mounted it on the wall with a mount from monoprice ($50 mount that swivels, tilts, and moves away from the wall). Everyone that has come over and seen it loves it. I finally have the perfect setup for myself!And ordering from Amazon was a pleasure as always. The box did come with a big rip in it, but I wrote the info down on the delivery guys paper and took a chance.

Sherr", "ReviewID": "RUEA3QUSSG5MQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a pretty large amount of research into HDTV before I chose this unit.  I have been in the IT business for about 30 years now, and I have seen everything from CRT to LCD for small/medium/large/incomprehensible stuff.  One thing about LCD screens is that no matter how one tunes the output, many of them produce obvious ghost lines (look carefully -- the straight lines usually stand out, and ghostly seam is about 3 millimeters to the right of the picture).  I decided to go with plasma because they are brilliant emitters, and because the picture itself never has the ghostly seams.The VIERA I got does things that are amazing.  Black on this unit is black -- any blacker and there would be a singularity involved.  I waited until 6/24 to activate HD programming, and made a quick comparison of Spongebob Squarepants.  In standard definition, the picture has artifacts in it, but you have to work to find them because of the 600hz subfield processing of the picture.  Anyway, in high definition, the picture has no artifacts at all, every line in the cartoon looks like it was drawn right there on your screen!  I really could go on and on.Color is no more brilliant, but the overall quality of the picture is much, much higher than on older sets.  With this unit, watching HD is like watching Kodachrome move.  You really have to see it.  Sound is not bad.  Only 720p native; but it does an accurate job of down-converting 1080p.  Even so, this thing is like a geyser of cool mountain water in the Sahara.Despite its bulk, it can be single-handedly mounted on a VESA mount.  Use as many extenders as possible -- otherwise the cord yard is unmanageable without taking the unit off the wall.  Also, with the picture on full brightness, the screen is only as warm as a handshake (back in the 80's, touch sensitive plasma terminals usually got uncomfortably hot to the touch).  Picture has excellent visibility from about 12 feet at nearly any angle.  A trio of 100W equivalent compact about 4 feet away interferes with the picture, however, the anti-glare coating works.  The bulbs reflect as bulbs on the screen, but only about an eighth of the screen is overwhelmed by their light, and the rest of the screen is not reflecting back much, if any at all.", "Date": "June 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Can't beat this value/price point for a 42", "Author": "John \"John\"", "ReviewID": "RLXN24X7VGYQT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I already have a Sharp Aquos 46\" and a Panasonic 42\" Plasma--both 2 years old--and I love them both.  I bought the Panasonic Viera 42\" X1 about two weeks ago for $[...], and you can now get it for $[...] at a couple of places (like one of the other reviewers, I was able to use the [...]). The new X1 is definitely better than either of the other TVs I own in terms of black levels, lack of blurring, and power consumption.  Connectivity is excellent, with 3 HDMI inputs.  The SD card slots are nice, too, although I consider the SD card stuff to be a fringe benefit and not a core reason to buy this set. I had read a couple of expert reviews stating that it's not possible to tell the difference between 720p and 1080p on sets less than 46\", and my own experience bears this out.  Since I look at high resolution images for a living, I am probably as picky as you can get about image quality and resolution.  For me, the Panasonic X1 is definitely the best 720p unit out there, and you don't need to waste money on a 1080p unit that is only 42\" or less.  I spent many weeks comparing picture quality side-by side on Panasonic, Samsung, Vizio, Sharp, and Toshiba, among others, at several different stores and in every case the Panasonic was clearly superior.The picture quality right out of the box is excellent, but I used the settings described elsewhere in these reviews and in on-line columns and the picture is even better.  It took less than 5 minutes to do this because the Panasonic menu is clear and intuitive to follow.  Picture quality on non-HD channels is also excellent.Sound quality is noticeably better than on any of the other brands in the same price range, though if you're going to connect it to a surround-sound system this feature won't make a difference to you.  The hum mentioned in a previous review is clearly a one-off thing, and probably due to non-TV electrical interference issues in the reviewer's apartment.I love the richness of colors on an LCD set, but when you are watching fast-action stuff like sports, the 600Hz X1 is far less blurry than any LCD TV within $[..]of this set--just look at a baseball or hockey game and try watching the ball or puck on an LCD (even the new 240Hz ones) vs. the Panasonic X1 plasma and you'll see what I mean.  Glare, even in daylight in a room with lots of windows, is minimal although I would give the edge to my Sharp Aquos LCD in this regard.If there is a drawback to the Panasonic X1 it is the lack of PC connectivity, but with a cable and adaptor available from most good electronics stores (like You-Do-It Electronics in my area) you can overcome this issue as well.  Another potential drawback is that the response time is rated at 8ms, which some gamers would find slower than ideal, but since I don't use the TV for games I could care less.  Again, to find a set with a 4ms response time requires spending a lot more $$.I agree with other reviews that the remote is relatively basic and could use a backlight, but this is par for the course in TVs in this price range, and I found the response time of the remote was excellent (ie, pressing a button resulted in an immediate effect with no lag).  Since like most people I use my cable remote to handle everything, the TV remote just sits near the set unused once I set the TV up and adjusted the picture settings.For me, this is by far the best value in a 42\" HDTV.", "Date": "June 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Amazing picture and easy user functions", "Author": "txlucky1", "ReviewID": "R1GDWGSR8LH84N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I decided on a plasma over an LCD because of the glass screen-kids in the house-and because of the greater viewing angle.

I had been looking at HDTVs for a very long time, trying to find the right features at the right price. I actually ended up getting mine elsewhere due to a sales price and 36-month interest free financing deal.There is no motion blur, the color, contrast, and clarity are outstanding. My main worry with plasma was reflection off the screen, but they've certainly solved that problem - this reflects much less than my old tube set, and the only reflection you'll see is off the shiny black bezel around the screen. On the upside, a big advantage of the plasma for me is the fact that it has a substantial protective glass screen, so when my little kids get their grubby hands on it, I can wipe it clean and not worry about the damage they might do to an LCD.As far as the 720 vs. 1080p goes, I've read too many articles by experts saying that you can't tell the difference unless the screen is 50 inches or bigger and you're sitting about 4 feet away. I sit about 8-10 feet away, and this picture is outstanding. I got it just in time for the NCAA tournament and could see every fiber on the player's uniforms. The Masters at Augusta National and Fenway Park are simply stunning on this thing.It looks as though plasma has lost the war with LCD, so I'm glad I was able to get such a good set at such a good price while I could.", "Date": "April 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great 42\" plasma", "Author": "John Foote", "ReviewID": "R2MK2T2AF8MVMJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not a television expert by an means except for having watched it too much for too many years. That being said, this TV has a great picture, more connections than you could ask for and super sound. (Point of fact: it replaced a 32\" conventional tv that was 10 years old.) Right now, I am watching the NCAA tourney and I can tell you which players are sweating and how much. I got this at Sears for $899 but the next day, I noticed that HHGreg had it for $100 cheaper. Sears matched the price and knocked of another $10. I chose this set above all the others because of the three years' interest free financing (cost under $25/month). They all seemed the same (LCD/plasma) to me and all of the pictures were great. I was able to take it home in a car. (Sears also had a free install deal on this so if it were wall mounted, that would have been a deal. However, it's on a stand so set up was no problem. Note: install does not equal delivery they were not going to deliver it for free.)I never buy anything when it is new, I'm always the one who buys the lawnmower that you brought back to Home Depot. In this case, buying new was a great idea. You will not be disappointed with this set. Some reviews I have read say the remote is skimpy. True; you will probably use the cable/dish one anyway or buy a replacement. The picture is why you bought the set anyway.Warranty: Sears wanted to sell me a 3 year for $300. I was able to locate a place on line that sells them for $150 for 5 years.Long winded but in a nutshell, if you are looking for a great deal on a great tv, this will fit the bill quite nicely and deserves a look.", "Date": "March 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great tv, great value, a few small drawbacks", "Author": "ParsnipPete", "ReviewID": "R3SCLH0E3XVTK8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ordered the 42\" X1 on Amazon (vendor:OneCall), no problems with order or delivery.

This is a great value for a really nice, good-sized, top-brand TV.A few small drawbacks to this set:1) Greens and reds are a little too intense, I'm still working to adjust the color2) Wish there were separate coax inputs for cable and antenna - not sure if a splitter will work or if the tv will scan channels from both sources at once.  Surely many people will want to have OTA hi-def along with their cable or satellite?3) No PC/VGA input4) Only digital optical audio out - so can't connect to older analog audio or stereo equipment without an expensive converter.

I'd wanted an LCD but the price, quality, Panasonic name, and features made this TV hard to pass up.  (I bought it at Sears for $599, free delivery, and old TV removal.)Power Use:  It's Energy Star rated.  Through my Killowatt meter the TC-P42X1 shows 0 watts when off (little or no standby consumption) and between 150-180 watts switched on.Resolution & Plasma vs. LCD:  Among the up-to-$1,000 TVs in the stores I couldn't tell 720 and 1080 apart.  The next most inexpensive set I considered, a Toshiba 40\" 1080p for $800, is equivalent in picture quality (but has lousy speakers). I will add that the days are gone when the plasmas on display outclassed the LCDs; there isn't much difference anymore.Size:  I sit 9 feet from the TV and it seems huge.  Most broadcasts are still 4:3, which translates to a 33 inch diagonal picture on this set.  I never really pictured this while shopping, and all the TVs on display in stores have 16:9 HD content running so it didn't really occur to me.  Not a complaint, just an admission that with trying to learn all the ins and outs of TVs in 2009 some of the basic realities escaped me.Weight:  The TC-P42X1 is 57.4 lbs vs. around 40 for a similar LCD.  I can heave it up on the wall bracket by myself, but at my age I'm nuts to do it.  This also means that all the warnings about proper wall mounting of flat screens (the bracket solidly screwed into two wall studs) are even more important for this one.Picture:  My wife and I watched the Boston Pops July 4 broadcast over-the-air via WBZ-HD and the picture quality was breathtaking.  Wow.Sound quality:  No complaints.  I have a surround system but only use it for movies.  The built in speakers are actually pretty good.Use:  Straightforward to set up and use, plenty of adjustments for personal taste in tint, contrast, etc.  The manual could be more informative, typical these days, but I didn't need it much.  THe TV has lots of connections and an SD card slot on the side for slide shows.Remote:  Cheap, utilitarian, easy to use.After my circuitous journey through TV shopping I'd say that in terms of picture quality anything by Panasonic, Samsung, Toshiba, or Sony would be fine and these are brands that have a good repair history.

It is a second large screen TV in my home, placed in the bedroom.  Granted, it is large for a bedroom, but our viewing distance to the TV warrants a larger image.  This TV came home with me because of the combination of reviews here and on Consumer Reports, and the price point.  Despite these good things going for it, rather than elation at my purchase, my experience thus far has been somewhat on the disappointing side.My setup is very basic: standard def cable TV and DVD player.  At first the cable TV hookup was via coax cable. The picture was nothing to write home about, less sharp than on my old 27 inch conventional TV. The first program I watched was \"The Wizard of Oz\" on TBS.  The image was extremely dark, annoyingly so.  Colors were very good, but I could not get around the degree of darkness in the dark scenes.  Attempts to improve the brightness/ lower the black level were met with frustration; I couldn't.Reading info online subsequently pointed out you can only access the black level when \"external devices\" are plugged in.  That means bump the connections up to S-video or component. (I would of course go to HDMI if I could, but my current cable box does not support it).  Once I connected the cable via S-video, I was able to adjust and reduce the black level.  That helped, but it is important to note the limited adjustment of black levels on this set: is either dark or light.  That's it; there are no gradations, nothing in between.  That level of flexibility is inadequate.  Compared to the flexibility of settings on my 46\" Samsung LCD, this unit falls far short in that area.Sound on the unit is fine.  I had no expectations that the TV's audio would compare to that from even modest external speakers or home theatre setup.  If I need oomph I need only move to my living room where a decent home theatre setup awaits.  To its credit, there is the capability to ratchet the volume range a few notches beyond normal.  This is valuable with my cable setup, as there are programs or times of day when the sound inexplicably drops and I have to crank it close to the max to hear it.I watched a standard DVD on an older DVD player hooked to the TV via component cable.  The image was fine, no complaints.  After rearranging DVD players to hook a newer, up-converting player to the plasma via HDMI cable, the picture it produced was as good as I could have hoped for: clear, sharp, good color rendition and good black levels.  Without a 1080P set side by side, I did not feel the 720p video capability on this set was a compromise.  Higher end sources (digital cable, Blu-ray) might make a difference, but without a 1080p set right next to it in my home, I can't compare, and so I don't feel as though I have lost anything at 720p.  That said, I do feel the image is much richer and more alive on my LCD.  Despite favoring the LCD image, I went for this plasma due to the combination of reviews, larger screen size and lower price when compared to a 40 inch LCD.  It was a stretch to convince my wife we \"needed\" this set; explaining an additional $250 expenditure given how little we watch TV in the bedroom would have been my undoing.The specs for this set show it to have an anti-reflective screen filter.  I find this helpful.  However, the glossy black bezel surrounding the screen is highly reflective, so whatever reflections are not caught on the screen are bounced back from the bezel; disconcertingly so.  The stand is also gloss black, and any specks of dust that land on it show very clearly.Overall, and so far, the set meets my minimum criteria.  It is a lower-end unit in Panasonic's line, provides very good standard picture and sound, but there are important adjustment capabilities missing.  While my situation did not warrant it, if this is going to be your main TV, spring for the extra $250 or so and buy the next level 1080P plasma or LCD set.  The cost difference to bump up in quality and features will long have been forgotten in a few months' time, you will future-proof your TV-viewing for a few years, and you will  have a better set.", "Date": "October 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Fantastic, I love it!", "Author": "Judy A.

After three years, I came to realize that a 32-inch size is not optimum for viewing from 8-10 feet away in our living room. So I set off on researching a larger HDTV option.I determined that a 40-42 inch size would fit our space perfectly and be well-suited to our viewing distance. Based on my good experience with the 32-inch LCD, I started looking at 40-inch LCDs only. I researched every model within our budget ($700) and found several good units from Sony, Samsung, Toshiba, and LG. It was very difficult to pick a clear winner.And then, while trying to make the LCD decision, I wandered over and looked at the plasmas.In the bright environment of BB, the LCDs definitely have the edge when it comes to \"wow\" factor with their bright, crisp displays turned up to the max. This is because people equate bright pictures with good pictures. In comparison, the plasmas appear more subdued and are not as \"punchy\" especially when they're side-by-side with the LCDs. But the plasmas develop a deep, rich image that can't be matched by similar-priced LCDs with conventional backlighting. Go take a look at the plasma displays set up in the low-light environment of the Magnolia section of BB and the quality difference of plasma becomes apparent.The beauty of the plasma is that each pixel can be turned \"off\" and essentially emits no light -this allows for very deep blacks and higher-quality color reproduction. Conventional LCDs have a constant backlight that bleeds through the LCD matrix and this makes it difficult for LCDs to reproduce dark blacks. Plasma is also free of image lag when viewing fast moving scenes such as sports (something that even the best LCD's have a hard time resolving). Plasma pretty much dominates the home theater world due to its excellent color fidelity, fluid images, and deep black reproduction. If you can control the amount of ambient light in your viewing environment (e.g. no bright windows reflecting off the TV screen or strong overhead lighting) then plasma can't be beat. From what I have researched and personally experienced, a lot of people struggle to find their perfect LCD display. They never find it...until they finally try plasma and realize that's what they've been looking for all along!I narrowed down my research to two, similar, 42-inch plasma models: the Panasonic P42X1 and the Samsung PN42B450. With Panasonic's long-standing reputation for plasma technology, I decided to order the P42X1. This is a well-built unit with a massive stand and solid construction. After viewing some HD feeds (Discovery Channel, etc.) from Dish HD and performing some image adjustments recommended by online forums, I realized that the 42X1's lack of multiple user adjustments is a detriment to what could be excellent picture quality. You get brightness, contrast, color, tint, and sharpness only. After several days of experimentation, I could not get the perfect balance of color and fleshtones. A more disturbing effect was that the 42X1 had trouble displaying very bright images and very dark images on the screen simultaneously. It was a subtle effect but was very obvious when displaying the Dish Network program guide. In the Dish program guide, there's an inset \"view\" of the tuned-in program superimposed over the dark blue/gray program guide that fills the entire screen. When the images in the inset view would go to high brightness, the dark blue background of the program guide on the rest of the screen would shift or \"flicker\" in brightness, as well. For some reason, the TV was being fooled by the high-brightness in one small area of the screen and would adjust the brightness in other portions of the image (this used to happen on old CRT TVs). Unfortunately, this phenomenon also existed while watching normal HD programming -if one area of the image became bright then the darker areas would shift in brightness, as well. A very unusual effect but noticeable while viewing different programs. I also ran full-screen \"plasma break-in\" images of various color gradations and noticed that about a dozen or so red and blue pixels in the lower left area were somewhat brighter than the others. Of course, this could only be seen up close. There were also some small dirt/dust particles in a couple areas behind the outer glass. I really wanted to like the 42X1 but had a hard time with several of the shortcomings mentioned above.So, for comparison, I ordered the Samsung PN42B450 plasma (similar in size and price to the Panasonic). Once I got the unit set up at home, I set both the 42X1 and 42B450 side-by-side in our living room and did a comparison test, making tweaks to both units, as needed. Both TV's looked good but the clear advantage was with the Samsung in overall color fidelity, contrast, and fine detail. The wealth of picture controls on the Samsung menu makes it very easy to calibrate the black level, gamma, white balance, etc. -adjustments that cannot be made on the Panasonic user menu. The Samsung could be easily adjusted to match the black level of the Panasonic, as well. As a matter of fact, after running several calibration test patterns for contrast and brightness, I found that the Panasonic could not display the dark gray patterns on my test disc no matter how much I adjusted the brightness and contrast adjustments. The Samsung had no such problem.Overall, I came to appreciate that Samsung allows the user so many different adjustments to suit individual taste. In addition, careful inspection of the Samsung's plasma screen revealed no defective pixels. The Samsung also had no problem with displaying bright images on dark backgrounds and suffered none of the resultant \"flickering\" problems that were easily seen on the Panasonic. The only vices on the Samsung so far appears to be its somewhat wobbly stand (a minor drawback since the stand also allows the TV to rotate to suit the viewing position) and the fact that the plastic bezel surrounding the screen makes crackling noises as the TV warms up. (UPDATE 2/25/10: I exchanged my first 42B450 for a second unit and the second one makes absolutely no crackling noises whatsoever. Based on my research, I believe that a brief production run of the Samsungs were built in late 2009/early 2010 with some \"noisy\" plastic bezels. Most people do not appear to have this problem.)OVERALL PERFORMANCE - SAMSUNG VS PANASONIC:PICTURE: Samsung wins this easily by virtue of its excellent color fidelity, contrast, and wealth of user adjustments. Both the Samsung and Panasonic achieve good black levels.SOUND: Both have adequate down-firing speakers that are ok for casual listening.MENU: Samsung's menu system is extensive. Panasonic's menu is very basic.FRONT CONTROLS: Samsung has attractive, touch-sensitive controls on the front of the bezel where they are easy to see and access. Panasonic's controls are located on the side behind the tv and can be difficult to see.REMOTE CONTROL: Both are adequate but Samsung's is more stylish on the coffee table.INPUTS: Both units have similar quantities of HDMI and Component inputs. Samsung has a VGA connector input for PC; Panasonic has an S-Video input but no PC connection. Panasonic has an SD Card reader for easy photo viewing. The rear of the Samsung includes a built-in cable tie to bundle the wiring.STYLE AND APPEARANCE: The Samsung has a more attractive bezel with dark red accents. Panasonic's bezel is all black with a bright silver strip running along the bottom edge. Overall, the Samsung unit is thinner than the Panasonic.BUILD QUALITY: Both units have good construction and all-metal back panels. The Panasonic's base is remarkably sturdy and feels adequate to prevent the unit from tipping over. The Samsung's base rotates to allow different viewing angles but this results in a more wobbly base. Some Samsungs built in late 2009/early 2010 may have \"noisy\" plastic bezels that crackle and pop as the unit warms up. My first 42B450 had this problem and so I exchanged it for a second unit -the second one is perfect and makes no noises at all.QUALITY CONTROL: The Panasonic unit I tested had a dozen or more red and blue pixels that were brighter than the rest. This could only be seen up close to the screen. There were also two locations where dirt/dust was trapped behind the front panel glass. On the other hand, the Samsung unit had no pixel defects or trapped dirt/dust. Both TVs are built and assembled in Mexico.Overall, I'm very happy with the performance and features of the Samsung PN42B450. Every HD show looks fantastic and the Winter Olympics have never looked better. I was originally set on the Panasonic P42X1 but quickly found several performance shortcomings (poor color, brightness fluctuations, and pixel defects in my sample) that made me return it and switch to the Samsung. I own several Samsung products and they've consistently delivered high-style, excellent features, and good reliability. As usual, Amazon's price was excellent and their delivery service was prompt --only three days from order to delivery at my house.The Samsung PN42B450 is an excellent value all-around.", "Date": "February 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Plasma Thats Missing One Very Small Item", "Author": "Keith Thompson", "ReviewID": "RXOIWS89KYQGA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As what a few others have commented on.

The neat thing with OPPO is that their line of players does not change every year. In what I mean is they do firmware updates to keep their player up to date.

Viewing distance was planned to be about 12 feet, and I decided to go with 42\".  I checked actual sets at Best Buy and other vendors and discovered that I couldn't tell the difference between 1080p and 720p from a distance of more than three feet, if at all (I took my own DVD and checked the settings on the various sets).  For my tastes, the image on the Panasonic plasma was more pleasing, warmer and more realistic.  The lower price made it a no-brainer.I ordered the set on a Sunday night.  On Monday, the price dropped about $50.  I called and Amazon credited my account for the difference.  My set was to be delivered the following Monday, so on Thursday, I called the delivery folks to coordinate the delivery.  A nice lady informed that that the set had already arrived and would I like it delivered the next day?The delivery was well within the scheduled window.  Two gents brought it up the stairs, unpacked it, mounted it on the stand, connected it to my cable box, put batteries in the remote and turned it on.  It worked perfectly.  They said they'd take the box and packing material if I wanted but suggested I might want to keep it for a week, just in case.  I decided to keep it, just in case.  The deivery, unpacking and setup took about ten minutes.I spent about an hour playing with the setup (thanks to the other reviewers for the picture settings!), hooking up the home theater (the built-in speakers might be ok for some but not me), dvd, etc.  About a month ago, I purchased a Tripp surge protector for the whole system, just in case.My friends rave about the picture.

I don't have HD channels so it is just a \"big screen\" for cable transmission.  But I watched a dozen or so movies and they look great.  At the store I compared the 1080p and 720p side by side from a approx distance of 6 feet or so while they were playing some Blue Ray disc.  I asked the sales person to not tell me which is what and in all honesty I could not tell the difference, but again this could be my inexperience.So far I have been watching DVDs at progressive scan mode which is 480p and I felt a noticeable difference when I hooked my DVD player to the TV using component cables instead of RCA TV out.The speakers are nothing to brag about but delivers crisp sound.  So I have it hooked up to my Altec Lansing speakers directly from my DVD player. One annoying thing so far is the TV has only optical audio out so if you are looking forward to connecting it to your home theater system or any other sound system (that does not have optical audio inputs) then you need to buy and optical to RCA converter which would cost you another $75 and up.For those of you thinking if 42inch is enough? I can say that I have a small living room 15X15 feet and it is just right for my taste, well honestly my wife's taste...I certainly would have liked to get a 50inch plus panel.  But I am not complaining, I watch approx 8-10 feet distance (watching 480p content from DVD) and it looks great.Come Christmas I plan to get a BluRay player and then maybe I will have to sit upfront.

There is an odd difference b/t LCD (which we also have) and plasma: LCD has a picture so clear that it's almost weird at times, whereas plasma has more of a deep color that looks as saturated as when you go to the movies at a really good theater. It's absurdly clear, too, but there is something about the way the color is presented that is more satisfying, less...digital.

I consider myself pretty picky about home theater and have always done plenty of research with AVSforums as well as Home Theather magazine act... That being said, I am completely satisfied with this TV. I believe the plasma televisions in this size to be some of the best bang for your buck you can spend. 1080p LCD's are the norm these days- and they look fantastic. But I would bet that the majority of people who are searching for a television in this size range would have a very difficult time telling the difference between the two. The 1080p sets DO look better if properly set-up and 1080p content is being displayed (most of the time it isn't), but plasmas have always had the edge with motion, deeper contrast (so I'm told, even though I'm not sure anymore, every manufacturer uses their own numbering systems and has a lot to do with the room environment) as well as viewing angle. The picture quality does not diminish when you get out of the middle of couch sweet spot that is so important for LCD televisions.  Prices are dropping big time on all flat panels, Visio's are even cheaper- but I believe Panasonic to be one of the best for Plasma tv's. LCD's are more popular, not always more expensive, but you pay extra for 120hz, or even 240hz type features just to provide the same motion abilities than plasma's have had all along. The biggest advantage for LCD is less energy consumption. (Slightly less.) HDnation from Revision3.com is another great place for HT geeks like myself to learn more about HT.

Picture and sound adjustments are plentiful and easy to use, but can always be returned to factory defaults when so desired. When shopping and viewing plasmas and LCDs side by side the LCDs invariably appeared sharper and brighter. In fact I brought one home only to return it the next day. Its image was indeed \"sharp\", but for some reason didn't seem pleasing to the eye. The qualities of a plasma TV are apparently more subtle and harder to detect in store type settings. In the end, I relied upon the positive reviews on Amazon and other sites and couldn't be happier with this choice.The only negative worthy of note is that the speakers are mediocre in quality and face straight down which can cause a little distortion when the TV is situated on a hardwood surface as mine is. Backing off the treble and bass a little (in the audio adjustments) helped a lot. Of course, for musicals and most movies I channel audio through a good sound system connected directly to the satellite receiver. Additionally, anyone considering this set would be well advised to read up on the issue of \"image retention\". The set has sophisticated safeguards built in which were apparently lacking in early plasma sets, but suffice it to say, it is better to avoid static images for long periods of time.

I did a lot of research and this had all the bells and whistles I wanted at a very affordable price.  I love being able to name the inputs (there are more than what I need).  That way when my kids want to watch something I don't need to choose which input they need.  I also like that you can adjust the picture and volume for each of the inputs.  We are still \"old school\" and have a VCR hooked up to this TV and being able to adjust the picture for the videos has made a big difference.  Especially when I go to watch a DVD and I don't have to switch it back.  They have preset settings but also a custom setting that you can use.  It remembers your custom setting so if you want to look at the other settings to decide what you like you don't have to keep adjusting the custom settings you had.  The menus are pretty easy to navigate and give you a variety of setting to choose from.  If you are worried about burn in this TV has some settings and even a scroll bar to take care of that.The only thing I do not like is that is does not have an audio out for RCA.

The reason I purchased this particular HDTV from others with similar features was in part because it was 100 dollars less than the others, but it was also because it was from a well known electronic giant that has always produced high quality products PANASONIC. I would say my decision was based on 10 percent price and 90 percent brand-name. The picture on this TV is outstanding when connected to an HD source like cable, over the air, and of course from a blue-ray player. It is truly a picture quality one would expect from a 1,500 dollar set, simply amazing. The picture from a standard definition signal is good, but not great, yet it is still above your average LCD or tube type non HDTV set. In order to truly appreciate an HDTV especially a plasma like this one, one has to connect it to an HD source, but if one is not available standard definition still looks very good on this Panasonic.The sound on this Panasonic is very good for being built in speakers. Most tv's fall short in this department not this one. The features and connections are good. I especially like the fact that it has a port for an SD card. This Panasonic also has a lot of customization features that are very useful, and will allow you to dial the picture and sound to ones liking. The only thing missing from this great plasma is a computer connection. I really would of liked to be able to connect it to my computer other than that I strongly recommend this outstanding plasma HDTV from Panasonic, you will not be disappointed. Panasonic is a high quality manufacturer, and it shows in this Plasma HDTV. The finish on the set is a high gloss piano finish that states pure elegance.

I did all the research a human could on the subject, I think I could actually get a job selling t.v.s now. Even though I have lots of windows in my house, I went with a Plasma. I don't regret it one bit. I went to Wal-mart, they didn't have enough selection in Plasmas, because I wanted the best name which is Panasonic for Plasmas. Walmart had a nice selection of LCD tvs, and very good prices. Best Buy didn't want to work with me at all, and their name should be \"Worst Buy\". With all the new technology out like anti-burn for the Plasmas, people should not be afraid to buy them. The color is so vibrant and warm and crisp. Me and my kids just laughed because we could not believe we got a t.v. so nice. My husband didn't even think he wanted a flat panel, he was hooked on his 32 in crt dinasour t.v.. Now he is smiling too. The only thing that bothers me a little is the size. It didn't look so big in the store, it actually looked like the baby of them all, but now it is enormous in my livingroom.My house is 1600 sqft, and I have a long livingroom, but it still seems huge. Other than that, I love it. I will be writing a review on a little 19\" Samsung white LCD t.v. too, I love it so much. Ok so my Plasma doesn't even have the special cable box to make it look more spectacular, but it still looks great with just cable t.v. Getting the T.v. on its stand was a little crazy, me and my hubby were yelling at each other, because it was heavy, and we couldn't see the holes in the bottom. We were doing all this at midnight, so we both were tired but excited to see it up and running. I walked out of HHgregg saving close to $300, they looked up everything I bought on Amazon, and tried to match it all. I will always go back to that store and Amazon. My t.v. actuall fell backwards on the wall home inside my van, but it is all fine. We are babying it, and going by all the rules to keep it from burning, and its no big deal, not hard to do at all. The Plasma t.v. is perfect, I just have to get use to the people on the set looking the same size as me,lol.

On the positive end, blacks look a touch deeper and I prefer the newer bezel.  However, out-of-the-box color is worse than last year's model, with greens and reds both standing out far too much and making everyone look sunburned and sickly while outdoor shots look positively neon.  The Cinema/Custom modes worked best for me.The real deal breaker for me is a very noisy, buzzy power supply.  Whenever the screen displays a bright white background (particularly after an all-black scene) a loud buzz/hum noise can be heard from anywhere in my apartment.  I'm used to TVs making their noises, but this one is unbearable, particularly because it changes in pitch and volume with the screem.  Low-volume listening is impossible.  My older set is almost completely silent unless I rest my ear on its back.I feel that my noise complaint is probably an isolated issue; if it weren't I think every review would mention it.  Panasonic plasmas are still near the top of the budget heap, but I ended up trading my noisy set for a new LG 50Q20 and I couldn't be happier.  Out of the box colors seemed more natural (plus a full suite of color controls in the easy-to-use menu).  The only thing I miss compared to the Panasonic is the LG's inferior anti-glare technology.

The 720p is just about as good as 1080 at normal viewing distances, and 1080 HDTVs are a good deal more expensive and consume more power.CHANNELS SETUP PROBLEM: after the initial system setup & scan for all channels, a new individual channel cannot be tuned in or added manually - if a new station comes on or you have to rotate your antenna to point at other cities, then each time a complete rescan is necessary, during which all previously stored channels are deleted. The \"Manual\" menu does not allow adding a new channel that did not show up in the previous scan, all very inconvenient if you have to rotate your antenna often. An incomprehensible omission, as Panasonic's VCRs could do this.AUDIO: weak, 20 watts output is claimed but it's nowhere near that, at 100% volume it's not even as loud as my table radio, and softly spoken speech often cannot be heard clearly. Furthermore, there is no headphone jack or standard left-right analog audio output jacks for playing the sound through your stereo, only a digital optical audio jack which is not usable with most older stereos which lack optical inputs.In short, it may be OK for those who are satisfied with a good picture with weak sound and do not rotate their antenna at all or very often, but it will be irritating to those who want good sound & headphone capability, and/or want to be able to add channels easily.", "Date": "September 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "TV is good, but shipping is not.", "Author": "lemonsky \"lemonsky\"", "ReviewID": "R366V7JLOCEFMF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Yes. 720P is enough. 42 inch is also enough for me (less than 3 meter distance).CONS: But the channel scan is not perfect. 1st, each time you scan auto, the previous result is removed all.
