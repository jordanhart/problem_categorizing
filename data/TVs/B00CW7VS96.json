{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fantastic picture quality!", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R1UTKZBVOWWDEV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My picture settings are towards the end of the review, for those interested.I am a avid sports fan and gamer, and was looking for a new TV. I bought this TV to replace a 42\" Panasonic TC-L42U25. I really liked that TV, but wanted a size upgrade. I did my research, and was originally looking at a Vizio E601i-A3. I went into an electronics Big Box store to look at it, and honestly wasn't impressed at all. The price was definitely right, but I really didn't need a smart TV since I have an Xbox and Playstation. The salesman then showed me a Samsung that was on sale, and it was better than the Vizio, but I still wasn't sure. Then they showed me this Sharp, and I immediately noticed the difference. Colors looked lifelike (most important thing about a TV to me), the size was great, and the price was right.I played with the settings in the store some in order to figure out what it looked like when not in Dynamic mode (I strongly recommend playing with the picture settings in store- you'll never use a TV at the Dynamic setting if you're looking for picture accuracy), and I got it to look a lot more lifelike than the other two TVs I mentioned. Football and baseball look outstanding, regular TV looks great, and video games do just fine- no major input lag that I can detect. I then ordered it from Amazon, and haven't looked back so far! Sound quality is just ok, definitely tinny, but I use a surround sound system like most people nowadays. It has 3 HDMI inputs (which should be plenty, especially with a passthrough surround sound receiver like I have), an optical out for other surround sound/soundbar connections, and composite/component connections. I sit approximately 10 feet away from it, and it fits perfectly. I was worried at first about it being too big for my apartment living room, but it's great!One drawback to this TV (and really most LED TVs now) is the viewing angle. The Panasonic TV I used to have had an IPS (In Plane Switching) panel that made the picture look as good as 170 degrees as it did looking straight on. The one 'problem' I have with the TV is that somewhere around 40-45 degrees off center, the colors start to wash out. Not a big deal in my living room, but if you have a big room or won't be watching from center, it's something to think about. Again, most LED TVs now have this problem, so it's not a dealbreaker and you're unlikely to find one without this issue in the price range.Here are my picture settings:Mode: MovieOPC: OffBacklight: -3Contrast: 25Brightness: 0Color: -3Tint: 0Sharpness: 5Advanced:Color temp: HighMotion Enhancement: On (low) /I usually turn this off when I'm not watching sports to avoid the \"soap opera effect\"Film Mode: Off:Active Contrast: OffDigital Noise Reduction: MiddleThese work for me in a semi-bright living room. Other reviewers have noted they can't get skin to look natural, but I think I did ok. I have found that some networks look more 'red' than others, but that's not something the TV can fix. Black levels are great for an LED TV. I calibrated the TV using a Planet Earth Bluray, and I felt like I was right there in the middle of it- outstanding picture quality (I can't stress that enough!). If your budget is right around the 4 figure mark, I think this is an excellent choice.PS- The shipping was great, and Amazon price matched the TV when their price dropped just after I bought it. Amazon Customer Service has never let me down!", "Date": "September 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent picture / basic sound", "Author": "Greg Pavlik", "ReviewID": "R31Z4JPS7HQ4GT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV has an top quality picture.  The sound is marginal and for best sound will require connection to a receiver or sound bar.Pros:* Outstanding picture:  Color is rich and vibrant; fast motion is clean; no artifacts from the LED back lighting.* Good mechanical design: TV is very thin, lightweight, and has a very narrow bezel; matte finish reduces glare from windows and lights.Cons:* No smart TV features:  No connections to services like Netflix or Amazon.  Most smart TV interfaces are pretty bad anyway, so a $99 RoKu 3 is a better option than paying more for a TV with these features.* Sound is basic.  High quality sound will require connection to a receiver or sound bar.Tips:* The way the TV ships it has some fairly serious overscan.  I'm running XBMC and initially went into its settings to adjust the picture size.  It overscanned by about 30 pixels on all four sides.  After a lot of poking around in the menu, I found a setting called \"dot by dot\" and set the TV to use this display mode.  Set to this mode, there is no overscan issue at all and I was able to remove the overscan correction from XBMC.* You can turn off the power LED from the menu.  I personally find the power ID annoying while watching TV and it's nice to have this feature.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best TV I've ever owned", "Author": "Robert Dellaquila", "ReviewID": "R2S8FJ4CIMFI11", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The color, brightness, clarity is amazing.

Cocchini", "ReviewID": "R16XABD57LB6CF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "2 WEEK UPDATE: The picture remains incredibly natural and visually pleasing.  As with other HD TVs, it is merciless when presented with inferior video.  I think that maybe the 'realism' feature may be a letdown for some that prefer artificially 'vibrant' to 'realistic' - maybe not.  The auto bright adjustment for ambient conditions is awesome.  Ran into the sound bar problem when connecting to the TV using a fiber optic link.  Got around this by running the Vizeo VBS200 sound bar/optical port out of the DVR (Hopper).  Also downloaded a recent firmware update that purports to improve use of the TV w/an external sound bar, but haven't tested that assertion.  The TV is indeed 'dumb', which I am very happy for, since the DVR has wireless/wired networking, Pandora, etc.Was going to get a 55' LG non-smart 120Hz - truly amazing picture quality.  HOWEVER, the Aquos has such ridiculously natural rendering, it's almost anticlimactic.  Almost.It seems unfair to ding the TV for the USB \"not working\", when a little bit of research reveals that the USB port is for service only.I have noticed two general classes of computer and TV displays: those with all manner of adjustments, and those with quite a few available adjustments, but limited when compared to similar products.  I have also noticed that in general, the name brand displays with more basic controls, generally start out with a better visual experience in the first place.  The Aquos seems like the latter type; plenty of adjustment capability, but not overboard.  And it seems appropriate, given the quality of the baseline viewing experience.The remote is epically ugly to the point that it seems purposeful.  It does however function.  Most folks I would think are going to have a DISH/DirecTV/Logitech/Xbox/Sony/other remote that will function as the primary for this TV.  FYI: The DISH Hopper remote can be programmed from the Hopper itself (NO HAND/CODE PROGRAMMING!).The sound is passable; nothing more. Seems to me all the really thin TVs [I know of] have marginal audio.  A hundred dollar sound bar like the Vizio VSB200 remedies the situation nicely.The low power consumption is a really welcome surprise.  The power cord is about equivalent to the under-cabinet radio in my kitchen, suggesting a very low current requirement.  The EnergyStar rating says it cost 20 bucks/year to run the thing.  I doubt it's that low, but it's not likely to be much higher.", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very much enjoying this TV.....", "Author": "Boozwaa", "ReviewID": "RC2XO8NNDHPT5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Have had it for a week now and so far I really like it. Not going to go too technical in this review, but I had this and the Panasonic 58 inch smart TV in my cart for some time trying to decide if I really needed a smart TV or not. The Panasonic  was a smart TV, this sharp was not and was 2 inches bigger. I already have a Roku so I figure I probably did not  really need the Smart features. I went to a big box store and saw both of these.  I thought the picture quality was pretty much the same The Panasonic had the better speakers. The speakers on the Sharp is very portable radio like. I figure I would get a sound bar to go with it, which I was intending to do anyway. Amazon, the next day had a Lightening deal for this  Sharp TV that included a sharp sound bar and the Google Chrome Cast for $899. So this pretty much seal the deal for me.After some tweaking of the settings to my taste, I concluded that this was one awesome TV and deal that I got for the money.  I turned off the OPC feature. I  thought  during the night time the feature made the picture a bit too dark. During the day in a bright room it works fine and is a nice feature to have.  I have no complaints at all about the picture. Love how thin the TV is.  Once it was set up on the stand it seemed lighter  than it really is. I  was able to lift it up ( slow and carefully) by myself on to the entertainment center.  The Sharp sound bar that came with the bundle is absolutely awesome sounding.Very satisfied with this TV in terms of picture and how thin it is, but one star off for the TV speakers.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect Fit", "Author": "Pokey", "ReviewID": "RR9IY91SQ1S4W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The picture quality is amazing!

Stenton", "ReviewID": "R2RJ2V7CXD9WGS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The TV is nice, has a good picture, and with the dynamic and automatic backlight adjustment it works well when it's bright in the room, and when it gets dark the picture dims, all automatically and adjustable in range. I am using this primarily connected via a laptop with HDMI for Amazon Prime video, Netflix, and other online video services. And also with a PS3 for games. I upgraded from an older 37\" Samsung after moving into a larger place. I have the TV hanging on the wall at a height of 94\" to the top, and the backrest of my couch is 14 feet from the screen. It's more than big enough for watching TV, or playing intensive video games (like GTA). With the old 37\" watching tv was bearable from the couch, but playing games required moving a chair closer to the tv.My only gripe with this TV is that there seems to be some kind of bug in the TV's firmware when getting an HDMI signal from my PC, the image is shifted to the right by about 4 pixels, leaving a black bar 4 pixels wide on the left side of the screen, and cutting 4 pixels off the right. Now on a screen this size it is completely un-noticable when watching videos full screen, and only barely noticable when navigating in Windows (the scroll bar on the right of a screen will be every so slightly cut off). I am waiting to hear back from Sharp's support on the issue, after searching around the net i found someone who had the same problem with a Panasonic tv, and pansonic had addressed the issue and posted a firmware update to fix it. I'm hoping Sharp does the same.I'm certain that the issue is with the TV itself and not with my computer's settings because this never occurred on my old Samsung TV.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far so good... some reviews are incorrect about audio issue", "Author": "Harrison W \"Harrison W\"", "ReviewID": "R1MUVF0A3KVNOY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just recently got this and so far, the picture looks very crisp.This is replacing an LG SmartTV and in my opinion, SmartTV is lightyears behind Set Top Boxes like Roku and Apple TV.People are complaining that audio won't pass through from HDMI to an output source.

Almost none of Sharp's work, for the above reason.  Also, I had a terrible time getting this TV delivered.

After reading up on this it appears that 3D is not all it's cracked up to be.  Very few releases and quality just isn't there yet, plus 3D broadcast channels are shutting down due to lack of interest, so who needs it?  (I find it tiring to watch in 3D, anyway and upconverts to 3D are very poor.)  Smart TV?  Really?  My BD/DVD player is a Smart system as is my Playstation.  Adding a Smart TV is simply overkill.  So, this TV fits the bill as a low cost alternative.  Other than not being 3D or \"Smart\" there is nothing else missing!  On setup, the TV insisted on \"finding\" a channel.  Not that I intended to use the TV input, (I have sattelite,) but I attached the small wire that was supplied as an FM antenna with my BD/DVD player and I was amazed.  The system picked up 30+ channels!  I then purchased a digital antenna and was disappointed as with a digital antenna attached I couldn't get a single channel, so back to the little wire where reception is amazing!If you're looking for a large screen that provides a great picture this is it!  Sound from the unit itself is OK, but I got this more for movies and games than for broadcast TV.  (Other than football, of course!)  I added a full surround system for sound so the TV speakers won't be getting much use anyway.  Though they were fine for football this weekend!  There are more than enough options for adjusting the color, tint and color temperature but I didn't find that to be necessary.  (Still I played with them and found settings that were more pleasing in the room where the TV is installed.)I have this TV in a room where there are no windows, but did check with lights to determine if there were any glare issues and the screen seems to diffuse most reflective problems.  I even took a photo, straight on, with a flash, and it only washed a small area where the flash was directly pointed, leaving the rest of the picture crystal clear.  I also like the automatic backlight, which adjusts screen brightness depending on the amount of light in the room.  Using the \"store\" settings the screen is too bright for my room, so there's plenty of backlight, brightness and contrast in reserve.  Optimum viewing distance appears to be 7-8 feet for a full immersive effect.

It makes you realize that they truly do design the metric to fit whatever they want to put on the box.I bought this as an upgrade to a 40\" quatron.  That tv was fantastic and the image quality was unsurpassed.  I didn't hesitate to pick up another Sharp.  However I am slightly regretting this decision.  While the size moved up the image quality went down drastically.  I'm not entirely sure if it's directly related to moving from a quatron to this panel but the contrast does not even remotely meet the claims.  In fact I can't even calibrate this TV.  The contrast is so low that the calibration metrics don't even fully show up.  It's missing about 3% in black and about 2% in white.  Doesn't sound like a whole lot but -5% of ideal is certainly not 4 million : 1.Technical jargon doesn't always translate to viewing, but unfortunately in this case it does.There is a noticeable loss of detail in shadows and highlights in movies.Where it really detracts is gaming.  For those familiar with setting gamma in games, I often can't even see the watermark that's used for calibrating gamma at it's highest setting.  That's regardless of contrast/brightness on the TV.  When playing dark games the loss of shadow detail is crippling.  I have to bump up the brightness at the detriment of image quality in order to play.If you're not picky and don't watch dark movies or play dark games you'll do just fine with this TV.

Really what happens:  when you are watching one of those \"dark\" movies and it is night or there is low light in your viewing room... it lowers the brightness on the tv and you can't see anything.

It is very light for its size and very thin.  The picture is crisp and the remote is actually pretty basic which is nice.  I really don't need 100 buttons on my remote to feel complete.

I noticed a of people ask \"is this a smart TV\".  No, it is NOT a smart TV, however, if you have a game system such as PS4, Xbox (or XboxOne), buying  smart TV is a waste of money.  Current game systems have more aps than many smart TVs.  This TV is thin, light-weight, and fairly simple to set up, although I would recommend downloading the operator manual from the Sharp website, as the printed version it comes with is printed so small a magnifying glass is needed.  Also, as long as your speakers have an optical audio cable, they are compatible.  I have an LG external speaker that works great on this TV.

And I couldn't.  Green, brown, and black looked strong.  Whites tended to be distractingly bright, unless I muted down brightness to the point of dulling everything.  Any attempt to use the automatic light adjustment dulled the picture down severely.  But the biggest problem was the reds.The reds seemed naturally dull, and difficult to control in relation to the other colors.  The end result was that every Caucasian's skin tone was (depending on tweaks) either coming out red with severe sunburn, or as pale as a corpse.  I couldn't get the skin tones not to be a distraction. My best tweak for Caucasian skin actually had everything so far out of wack that you could not discern an African-American from a white person with a tan.  I was watching a WNBA game and could hardly tell the white players from the black ones.  Skin tone was awful on this with the presets and with every tweak I tried.  Perhaps I'm spoiled from years of looking at my Sony, but I couldn't make do with this.In the end I returned it to Best Buy; the woman working returns told me they had other returns on this product with the same complaint.

And that is a good thing...So for those that don't need a smart TV, and want size, and (relative) quality for the lowest possible price, this may be the one for you!First of all, you get what you pay for. Keep that in mind. This is not going to blow your mind, but if your current HDTV is a mid grade or or less around 5 or more years old, it will impress. The lack of features also extends to the user menu unfortunately, so the options to tweak or self calibrate will leave home tuners wanting. Red and green have some issues, but that is expected if paying less than $2000.Overall this set can be fantastic if it is what you need.

Maybe I'm just living in the past, but I expected a TV of the plug-it-in-and-work variety.  Nope, scrolled through this menu and that trying to turn off the auto-dim feature.  I'm sure it saves energy or whatever, but it also makes the picture dim enough that you have to squint to see it.  And good luck seeing it at all if you're not in a pitch-black room with that auto-dim feature on.But I persisted and overcame, and an hour or so later had a functioning TV.  I'd even put together a sweet Raspberry Pi/RaspBMC media center setup.  Everything worked reasonably well for the first week or so.Then one night, I went to turn it on and nothing happened.  The power light came on, but no screen.  Not just no picture--even when I went to pull up menus, there was nothing.  Being the technology genius that I am, I performed step 1 of troubleshooting:  I unplugged it and plugged it back in, and it worked again!  Until a few days later when it randomly did the same thing again.  This time I let it sit overnight, and then the next morning it decided to start working again, this time for a couple of weeks.  Well, okay, maybe it's a fluke, I thought to myself.Tonight as I sat down to dinner, I went to turn on the TV and it started flickering rapidly, epilepsy-trigger style, between the screen image and the negative.  Checked all connections, all good, still flickering.  Tried multiple inputs, still flickering.  Unplugged, replugged, turned back on, still flickering.  Unplugged everything from the TV, still flickering.  Fiddled with all settings in every menu, still flickering.  Reset to all defaults, still flickering.  Let it sit for an hour (I don't know, it fixed itself last time *shrug*)... STILL FLICKERING.Taking it back tomorrow for store credit, which I'll put towards something I can trust to turn on when I push the power button.  Goddammit, Sharp, I wanted to believe in you.Edit the next day:  when talking to the delivery guy about coming to pick it up, he said he's taken 3 of these TV's back already since Black Friday.
