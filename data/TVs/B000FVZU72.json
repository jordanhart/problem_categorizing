{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Chris Huddleston", "ReviewID": "R1PMCSNAOX5TZ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received my 62HM95.  This television is an upgrade from the last years model of the 62HM94.  The only real difference is a brighter and longer lasting lamp and the upgraded software for the online TV guide.  This TV uses the Texas Instrument DLP technology.  DLP stands for Digital Light Processing and is considered a very stable and long lasting projection technology as opposed to LCD and especially plasma.  This TV using cable either can use an installed cable card or the box.  If you choose the card and you gain and you lose.  Mostly you lose the ability for pay-per-view and video on demand.  If you would rarely use these as I rarely do then it is no loss.  You gain no rental fee for the box even though there is a small rental for the card.  Also you wont have a big cluncky box hooked up.The screen is bright and as sharp as they come with HD programming.  But in reality, most programming is not in HD but either in analog or digital.  Digital looks pretty good and the analog stations look like crap.  Ironically, the receiving technology in this TV far exceeds the available transmission technology.  Using a DVD player, made sure it has the progressive scan feature and use the component hookup versus the audio/video hookups.  Without progressive scan, looks like crap. Without the component hookups, looks like crap.  Forget your VCR and old LaserDisc players, you just won't like the look.  Very digital looking if you know what I mean.You will like the lamp, which has a limited life, on bright.  The lamp is rated from 6000 to 8000 hours.  Toshiba told me they expect it to last 5 years.  We will see. Toshiba states that the lamp will likely need replacement at some time.  The lamp is easily replaced by the owner but also be aware that at least as of right now, a new lamp cost about $400.  Pretty pricey.  The TV is very light, just under 100 pounds and is about 21 inches deep.  It sits closer to the wall than most.  Keep in mind also that this TV pretty much only fits on the stand made for it but doesnt come with it.  It is also about $400.This is not the TV of old where you plug in the cable, turn it on and bam it looks great.  It definitely takes some fine tuning and has a lot of options for that tuning.  Lots of little perks like you can directly place in digital camera cards and looks at the pics, kinda neat but you probably wont use it much.  But, once you get the tweeking down, this TV looks and performs as good as any out there for the money and Toshiba's customer service is top-notch.", "Date": "August 17, 2005"}, {"Title": "Bad lamps / bad customer service", "Author": "Mark Gouras \"markg10568\"", "ReviewID": "RR8UBEOQH88D8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I like the tv overall. Beware Toshiba, however.  The lamp life was too short.  When I ordered a $199.95 replacement and paid extra for 2 day shipping, the lamp didn't come for a week.  When I called Toshiba, they explained that I ordered after 2:00 p.m. on a Friday, and they don't ship on the weekend.  When I explained that this still didn't explain why 2 day shipping took a week, they explained that address verification took some time and that I received it 2 days after they finally shipped it.The bottom line is: 1) the lamp life is short; 2) the replacement cost is expensive; 3) you will be without your tv for a week even when you pay for faster shipping; and 4) Toshiba customer service is poor.", "Date": "June 14, 2006"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "62\"\" HD DLP TV", "Name": "62\"\" HD DLP TV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21JS74DZ64L.jpg", "ProductID": "B000FVZU72"}}
