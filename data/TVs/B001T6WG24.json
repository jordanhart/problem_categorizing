{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Outstanding", "Author": "Deegan Peter \"Deegan\"", "ReviewID": "R1TRE5L3GC5IJK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been researching on and off for almost 6 months trying to find the \"perfect\" tv that will fit my needs and my pocketbook.  I have reviewed the technical details and the specifications of numerous tvs and had narrowed the search down to the Samsung LN46B630 and the Phillips 47 PFL6704D.  I had decided on the Samsung and went to my local Sam's Club to buy it when the manager of the electronics area, told me they had a rash of returns on the Samsungs over the last month.I had no reason not to switch as both units were at the top of my list, but after making my decision and purchasing the Phillips and using it for 10 days, I know I made the right decision.Arriving home with the TV my wife assisted me in removing it from the box.  This task is made very easy by the clever design of the box.  It is a two person job.  Do not try it by yourself as you are likely to tip it over and damage the TV.  The next day, the Direct TV guy came and installed our dish and hooked up the tv.  He hooked up the tv and couldn't believe the tv didn't appear to need any adjustment right out of the box.  He also couldn't believe how effective the matte screen reduced the amount of reflection nearly to zero.I have only had one LCD TV and that was a 26inch Vizio in my RV.  It seemed to take forever to get that adjusted for acceptable color etc.  The Phillips seemed to need no adjustment so I thought I would wait for a few days before making any adjustments.  The PFL670 is a 120 Hz so one sees no \"judder\" and its 2 ms response time is so fast you don't have ANY lag time or jerky movements during fast action scenes.  The colors are bright and vivid it kind of reminded me of when I got new glasses my entire world brightened up.  So it is with the Phillips TV.  I have a friend who is a TV tech at a national electronics store coming over tomorrow.  He told me he will be glad to make any adjustments since they don't sell Phillips at his store.  He wants to be able to compare it to the Samsung and other models they do sell.  He was very skeptical that the set would be \"IN TUNE\" right out of the box.  If possible, I will come back and make additions and corrections to this review when he has completed his \"tune up\". In summary, my wife and I are both pleased beyond belief that we found a TV that meets all our needs including the lack of reflections by the matte screen.  We wish that all our decisions would work out this well.I want to add, that I don't think it fair that people mark a TV up or down with delivery issues.  The delivery has nothing to do with the product and it's performance.  Delivery is a separate issue.  I rate the Phillips soley on it performance and its specs.  I try to compare it to other products and their specs.  When a product does not meet its specs it should be downgraded in the review.  In the case of this particular Phillips TV, in my opinion, this model meets or exceeds all the specs.  The contrast issue of 50K to 1 with this model is reduced by the matt screen.  If you have a glossy screen you will have a sharper black.  However, with a matte screen and a setting with the potential for reflection, our living room with a walk thru patio door, we were more concerned with reflection than we were with sharper blacks.  After all,  50K is right up there with the best of them regardless of the matte screen.", "Date": "July 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Extremely Impressed", "Author": "southernarc", "ReviewID": "RZTADGIFPL5YB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent hours comparing the features and picture quality of this HDTV versus similarly priced and sized Vizio and Sanyo models.  The audio blew away the Vizio in volume (appeared to be equal that of the Sanyo), and the picture quality of the Philips seemed to be slightly better than the Sanyo (and equal to the Vizio) when compared side by side.  The Sanyo had a ton of features on the remote to adjust the picture, however the Philips scored high in terms of \"ease of use\" in setting up a great picture to your own preference.  The Philips also had better specs than the other two brands, e.g. the response time was a blazing 2 ms which makes for sharper dynamic images.I also researched all three models on line, and found that there were many complaints about the Vizio breaking just after the one year warranty expired.  When all was said and done, I took the Philips 47 inch TV home.After viewing this TV for about a month, I have nothing but praise for it.  The clarity is fabulous and the colors are vibrant and realistic.  Watching certain shows/movies in HD just blows me away; the depth of field is so deep that the picture has a three dimensionality to it.  The equalizer is a great feature for the audio, and presents a very nice sound stage and is so powerful at 20 Watts there's a lot of volume on reserve.I also like the \"Power Saver\" preset mode and use it often.  It gives a very decent picture yet it uses considerably less than its 285 peak power consumption.  With it's 4 HDMI and 4 A/V ports, along with S-Video and USB 2.0 (for viewing AVI as well as WMV movies directly from a flash drive), this TV has all the ports you would need for any home entertainment center.  Hooking up a laptop (Mac) was easy after buying a DVI-HDMI adapter (but if you do use an adapter you'll also need a separate cable for your audio).The remote control is sleek (even for smaller hands), ergonomic, and easy to use.  It has the look and feel of a quality remote that will last.When I phoned Philips for help hooking up my laptop to the TV, they answered the phone promptly and were very helpful, professional and courteous.  I have phoned them in the past with questions (I have other Philips products) and have always been very satisfied with my experience with Customer Service/Tech Support.I highly recommend this TV for anyone looking for a larger HDTV at a good price.  To me Philips means quality, and I am becoming a loyal customer with every purchase I make.", "Date": "December 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very good for the money", "Author": "Solomon70", "ReviewID": "R23WYYS32TUUQF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The TV arrived with a defective remote control but a call to Philips got a new one on the way and it arrived quickly. Once the remote issue was resolved, the setup was fast and easy and the picture quality is great. Once the filters were setup, the sound is very good but best sound will be obtained with a good set of external speakers. The TV ships in a mode that requires the remote in order to enter the setup mode and if I had not been able to make a temporary repair, the entire set would have been returned as defective because of a five cent switch being stuck in the closed position. That being said, I am very well pleased with the TV and would buy another one if I needed it. I was well pleased with the way Philips responded to the warranty coverage. The agent was polite, helpful and very capable and the replacement remote arrived in two business days.", "Date": "August 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "lovely LCD TV", "Author": "Charles \"Snakebit\"", "ReviewID": "R2XBD4TAN9WYR0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nice picture when judged side-by-side to a Samsung 40\" (the Samsung was rated the #1 value by Consumer Reports) perhaps not a saturated but one could likely adjust it if so desired to have more \"pop\". Seems to be more susceptible to horizontal judder than the Samsung. Pretty cheap for a screen this big. Paid significantly more for the 40\" just one year ago. Odd remote, but it works well and is easy to program if you hold your tongue correctly!", "Date": "June 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Does well in glare; senior-friendly remote control", "Author": "Gary E.

The new unit looks sleek and attractive in the family room, and the picture holds up well despite sunny glare from south-facing windows.

Great Picture and good sound. I have had good success with Philips products over the years and own several electronic items by them. Set-up was quick and easy and I have had no problem. Blu-ray and Streaming Netflix look awsome. My HD cable channels are excellent also. I have no complaints so far.  I can't complain about Price/Performance.

Clear picture. Lots of HDMI and other video inputs. I've even connected my laptop to the screen with a bluetooth keyboard and mouse for the ultimate computer gaming screen.
