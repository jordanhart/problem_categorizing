The picture is excellent and it has all of the basic features you need.  The sound quality is so-so, but most of us would plug it into a surround system anyway.

And basic cable. The Hisense QAM tuner automatically picks up the HD TV stations along with a few extra channels. Westinghouse decided few consumers wanted this so you have to input both the TV serial number and a code 14159 to get these stations. I have tried this numerous times but still cannot get the HD channels. Very frustrating!", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "niki", "ReviewID": "R1D0Y86J7JUYR6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is a great TV. It is in great shape. It works fine. The only thing, it didn't come with a stand. Can someone tell me, where can I buy the stand ?", "Date": "July 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wow.", "Author": "Troy W. Isakson", "ReviewID": "R2R4TKBJVNV1ET", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV has been working flawlessly for us for a long time.  It was very cheap, but who cares?  The picture quality is amazing compared to other, more expensive comparable units.  The speakers are awful, so you must have a surround system to hook it up to, but they are all like that anymore.  Again, the picture with BluRay and HD programming is amazing for the price.  I looked at dozens of TVs and usually get name-brand stuff, usually Sony or Samsung, but after seeing this one, it was a no-brainer.  Who doesn't like to save money?  Buy it.  If it stops working after a few years, then you are only out $350....", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "I BOUGHT 2", "Author": "dragon", "ReviewID": "R3RX125CBZZH1P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easy to set up and great graphics for a very cheap price. I can play 1080p videos and is comparable to a sony or samsung in graphics.

I unplugged everything and replugged it then it came on for two days then went completely dead and the little orange light is on and that is the only way to know that it is plugged in so I am definitely going back to my Toshiba and will never give Westinghouse another thought.", "Date": "October 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Buy", "Author": "BS", "ReviewID": "R2D6DEA7OA2PAS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This transaction was super easy and the product a really great purchase.  Amazon sent the TV right away, and it arrived just as specified, wrapped well.  Was so surprised that the picture was so clear!  The price was right, the purchase easy.  Will do this again for another Westinghouse TV - in a minute!", "Date": "October 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "LCD 40 inch tv", "Author": "samus", "ReviewID": "R36FSE5B5II116", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Tv stand is slanted, I don't know if it's supposed to be that way, because it looks different from the picture.  BUT, tv stands firmly lol. It took a while for it to arrive, but understandably so, I'm in the west coast, the tv was sent from the east coast (and it weighs a lot). But everything works perfectly, and the t.v. was a great price that I couldn't find in any stores. I will buy for this company again.
