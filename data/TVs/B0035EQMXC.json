Instead of a standard black TV, I decided a pink TV would look cute.  We've had no problems with it.  I believe you have an option to mount it onto the wall, but we have it sitting on a dresser.  The bottom part of the TV is much wider than the top portion.We have a military FPO address.  Unfortunately, the vendor would not ship it to us.  Instead, we had to pay a middle-man to make it happen.  Not sure why they won't expand their shipping locations.  The FPO address is just as shipping to California.  Paying extra for all the shipping was the only down-fall.  Overall, satisfied with the TV.", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "22-inch designer LCD TV\nDynamic contrast ratio 30,000:1\n1 HDMI, PC input, 1 component input\nUSB input for video, audio and digital pictures; Pause live TV with USB TimeShift\nSRS TruSurround XT Sound; Sound leveler with distortion control; 2x3W output\n22\" Lcd Color Display\n3D Digital Comb Filter\n720P Resolution\nIntegrated Atsc/Ntsc/Qam Tuners", "Name": "Haier HL22FP2 Pink 22-Inch Designer F Series LCD HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51meNJ2347L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0035EQMXC"}}
