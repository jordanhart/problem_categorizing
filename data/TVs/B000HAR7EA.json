This is an \"industrial\" model rather than a consumer model. Because of this, there are some things to consider before purchasing:1) No built in tuner (not an issue if you have digital cable or satellite)2) No built in speakers (not an issue if you use an audio receiver and surround sound to take advantage of the sound quality from HD channels!)3) Stand/Mount not included (you have to buy it separately)4) Limited included inputs (You can purchase a \"blade\" for HDMI or DVI, or even some for high-end video monitor input)This is one great value for a plasma. The picture is beautiful. Image retention is virtually nonexistant--even when I pause things on my DVR for several minutes, nothing has \"burned-in\". I can't speak to video games, but CNN/ESPN tickers and channel logos are not an issue for this set.You can tweak this monitor much more than the consumer models, perfect if you really are into A/V equipment and home theater. It has incredible black levels and a great contrast ratio.I purchased the stable stand for this set. It's surprisingly sturdy. The TV is in no danger of falling.If I had the choice again, I'd buy this set in a heartbeat. It's 5 months old and I have NO regrets.", "Date": "December 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Plasma", "Author": "Peter Conte", "ReviewID": "R3B221T5PIBL9E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "CNet was right on the money rating this plasma excellent. I would rank it as phenominal in terms of it's clarity, color, and performance. This is not a full 1080p resolution, only 1080i, but it honestly could matter on a screen this size (not to mention that nothing much is even in 1080p yet anyhow). Sportcenter looks amazing, Monday Night Football is stunning, and HBO HD has some really impressive movies that look great (I watched the original JAWS movie, and that initally sequence with the girl in the water took on a whole new scary feel). I also enjoy how I can hook up my computer and watch TV and browse the internet at the same time.I researched plasma screens quite extensively, and this is the best bang for the buck out there. I am actually debating getting another one, the price was so good (how's that for a review, eh?).I do have advise on this purchase, for others. It is in Panasonic's \"professional\" line and as such it has no tuner, no speakers, no HDMI input and no stand. Most people have a cable box or dish, so no tuner is rarely an issue--and you'll want to run the sound through your home stereo anyway to compliment sound with picture--but you absolutely will need to buy a wall mount or the stand for this screen. You will also need the HDMI input (sold separately), if you want the high quality input feed. You could probably get away with component video cables, but for an extra $130, it will be worth it in the end. I got the input and the stand (also both Amazon purchases) and was very happy about it.Lastly, Amazon routed my purchase through Ritz Camera as the vender. I was skeptical at first, reading some of their online reviews from other users, but they deliever on time, with no problems at all. I would be willing to use them again, personally. Their customer service phone support isn't the best (they have no idea what they are doing), but it was a non-issue.Enjoy, this is a great product.", "Date": "February 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "Very Good near-HD quality plasma", "Author": "E. Oxenberg \"Just another stay-at-home comput...", "ReviewID": "R3RA1MOHSBCO1E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros* Amazing lifelike color* HD content looks beautiful with lots of details* SD content, while not as detailed, looks much better than on normal TVs (heck, better than most other HDTVs)* Deep blacks with very good shadow detail* Independent inputs (great for universal remote controls)* Independent color settings for each input* Good-looking minimalist frame* Built to last forever (it's an industrial model)Cons* Stand sold separately (extra $200)* Few input ports, and HDMI is an optional accessory (extra $175)* Speakers sold separately ($350, but users should route through their stereo receiver or home theater A/V systems for much better sound anyway)* No built-in channel tuners (but most people get broadcast signals from cable or satellite anyway, so you use their tuners instead)* Glossy screen reflects surroundings, which may be distracting with daytime use* 720P resolution isn't quite true HD (1080P, but as a 42\" set, from 8 feet away you won't be able to tell, and almost all plasmas this size are not either).This is one of the best values on a 42\" HD set available today. Not only do you get class-leading video reproduction with great color and clarity, it's a tweaker's dream with extensive adjustments for tone, color balance, black level, etc. Compared to most consumer displays in its price range, the Panasonic has superior black reproduction and very accurate color.It's few drawbacks -- you must buy some accessories separately that come standard with consumer models -- are more than compensated by it's low price and great performance. Plus, it looks great with a matte charcoal finish and no wasted embellishments like silver trim or lame built-in speakers.The proof is when you watch HD content, either DVDs or high-def programming from Discovery HD or HDnet. Even ABC news in HD is amazing...wow, check out his hair...and her makeup! You've never seen a newsperson so clearly before.

Larson", "ReviewID": "R3AETHQO0VYIU2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "See the earlier review and product description to what does and (mostly) does not come with this TV. If you already have speakers, a cable box/tuner, and no need for the stand... you can save some bucks with this TV. Don't think of this as a TV per se, more just a display.But what a display it is! The picture is drop-dead gorgeous, with excellent black levels, great contrast, bright colors, etc... everything you would expect from a top-flight HD TV. We only had standard-definition programming the first couple days we owned the set, and I was shocked at how good even standard def looked. (Some HD sets make standard def look terrible.)Anyway, bottom line, I would totally recommend this TV and would buy it again if I had to.", "Date": "February 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Look around, this one gets great reviews everywhere.", "Author": "MATT", "ReviewID": "RMNQ2QKO291SP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: 1) Great picture! This plasma has the contrast you just can't find on an LCD.... not to mention the vibrant color! 2) The native resolution is higher than similarly priced panels at 1024X768. 3) This set easily produces a 1080i signal out of a cable box. Currently most satellite and cable companies are broadcasting HD in 1080i, and this panel which I am using as my bedroom tv is fitting the bill perfectly! I should mention I'm using component to BNC adaptors for my picture. I also own a Sony 50\" plasma which is also beautiful(but has had some reliability issues) and have tried an hdmi in that set and found that the picture looked better with component cables. With hdmi, the picture lost it's vibrant colors, and for the hefty price I returned the cable from where I bought it. Both cables were from the same top manufacturer. I also say skip the terminal board, unless you really need a HDMI input and just buy decent component cables. Even the component cables supplied from the cable company work just fine.Cons: 1) The moniter should come with some BNC adapters. You will need to buy some if you use the component option. They only cost a few bucks and you will need 3 BNC adapters(BNC male/RCA female). 2) No tuner or speakers. This is exactly what I wanted though as my cable box is being used as a tuner, and I wanted to chose my own speakers. Not really a con unless you want these built in. In that case, you should buy the consumer version.Other Thoughts: I'm thrilled with this purchase. This tv came with a free 5 year warrenty from Panasonic as long as you purchase before December 31, 2006. Keep an eye out because this free warranty is still re-appearing form time to time. A 5 year warranty simply means Panasonic has a lot of confidence in their product!This is the second time I've dealt with the delivery company AIT(not sure who Amazon is currently using). Both times they've been awesome. They are not required to bring the tv inside(front door delivery), but have always offered. Just be sure you examine the panel before you sign anything as it could become damaged in shipment. Also, they usually deliver alone, and it's good to have somebody home to help them who is capable of lifting. Otherwise, you will have a problem. They call to schedule a delivery time. It will only protect your display.", "Date": "June 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great picture/easy set-up/great price", "Author": "P. miller \"blackopalproductions\"", "ReviewID": "R3Q03UT53CSRC7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It took longer than I hoped for it to arrive ,but that was to be expected because of our remoteness.Hard to track shipping.The plasma arrived in prefect condition not a mark on the box.I removed it from the box,  set it up,plugged it into the wall then plugged the Directtv dvr.

Yeah I wish they were 1080p .. but watching it.. I've never been disappointed at all... They are really beautiful screens.  Now matter where we go and what we've seen in stores and other peoples new 1080p HDTVs, we are always glad to get back home to this set.  Couple of things.. I don't know why people bother to tell you there is no tuner.. I don't know anyone that uses their built in tuner anyway.. we do have one bedroom hdtv we just use the built in speakers.. but those too.. few people use.. I guess it's best you know that a monitor doesn't include those though. And as far as being glossy and shiney.. Our 50 inch model in in a room with 4 - 25 by 8 foot windows in front of it.. and glare has never been the slightest issue. My wife's favorite seat is as the perfect angle to be glared out.. and she doesn't even notice it she says.. So we have a pretty extreme setup for glare, and it isn't a problem. It looks like it will be before you turn it on, but it's not.  Yes you don't get many inputs.. but you can buy more... and the really cool thing about that, I've already found out.. is as your equipment changes.. you can switch to different types of inputs.. to hook up most anything.. They has built in split screen controls.. big picture, little picture in picture, two pictures same size.. some (the 50) 3 pictures..  I hooked a PC up with a blue tooth keyboard and mouse and I watch TV, or use my PC or both.. or can switch to my old Nintendo Game Cube without getting up... Which is what I'm doing now with the 42 in the quest room.  The rez could be better for using with a PC.. but it's great still.. big and beautiful..  We say that and you go 'ok'.. but I tell you.. watching an HD travel show is just stunning.. sometimes it's better than being there....  Get the expensive steel stand.  These things aren't the lightest.. the stand holds in firmly in place.. I would mount the 50s on the wall unless you plan to go ino the wall and do some serious bracing...  You can go to Panasonic.com and go to the Business section (not Commercial).. and find the monitors there.. It will show you all the different input boards you can get (you can even get a board with a whole PC built into it.. I wouldn't.. but still) These inputs change with the times, which is nice. I expect these monitors will last a long time.. I think they have like 60,000 hour expected life time without repairs.. which is years.. They are built to be left on as displays in airports and stuff... so they are rugged.. You just won't be unhappy with these monitors, once you crank them up..  Whenever you come home to it from a trip.. You will turn it on.. and know you are back home...", "Date": "March 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Amazing HDTV monitor", "Author": "G.

Let me start off by stating I am extremely pleased with the monitor. It has, so far, produced a fantastic image onscreen - and this is without HDTV.Delivery via VANN's was great - cheap (only $30), I waited until the price was right $999. VANN's delivery \"rules\" were curbside but the driver helped me into the house anyway and helped me inspect the outside and inside of the package. No damage - unit was in perfect condition. I had to work to get delivery when I was home but they held onto it until my day off.As to the Plasma - yes, even with the warnings on this site I STILL had problems figuring out how to correctly hook it up. I still haven't figured out the component hookup but this is still pretty new for most everyone - in fact, I knew I was in trouble when I was explaining things to the \"experts\" at Radio Shack and the like. The key things I learned were :1:) No composite (red/white) inputs at all2:) S-Video and Component is available (HDMI is extra - I have not added that yet)S-Video did not work until I figured out how to change inputs - it has three \"boards\" and it came out of the box on board 1 (that might be HDMI) board 2 was for s-video and once I switched to that, my satellite feed worked. Also, my S-video feed from my receiver also works. Like I stated, component is still not working but I am certain that is MY problem and not the plasma's.The picture is outstanding. I am still learning more about this unit and I may update this review at a later date.
