This review is anonymous purely from the privacy point of view. What I like about this TV is it seems to work.  The large number of inputs is extremely useful, two S-video and two component video, I think there is the traditional 75 ohm cable connection as well.  Switching the input also switches the audio output.  So if you are like me and run the sound system using a separate amplifier and speakers this simplifies life enormously for wiring, the number of inputs required on the amplifier and for choosing the sound source on the amplifier. Picture quality is reasonable.  I used to use a Sony 20 inch Wega which has the best picture quality I could find.  The LCD picture quality is comparable and certainly watchable.For two people watching it had some very interesting side effects.  Because it was so slim we were able to throw out the old TV table.  Move the TV back closer to the wall.  Move the sofa a bit closer and reclaim enough room behind to put in another book case.  It doesn't seem to dominate the room as the old television did.The 16:9 aspect ratio is very nice when you have 16:9 material available.  DVDs seem to come in native 16:9 and wide screen stripe across the middle to show on a normal TV.  This TV set allows you to resize the picture within some limitations.  There are more options for resizing on the s-video connection.Although this machine supports 480p subjectively the picture was not much different from a DVD source.Wish list, at this price and with this much flexibility it would be nice to play my Zone 2 PAL DVDs back in PAL. Note that LCD screens are not as delicate as the Plasma displays and are considerably cheaper.  This one is one of the largest LCD screens available.", "Date": "November 22, 2002"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00006ANY9"}}
