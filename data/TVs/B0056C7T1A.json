Waiting for their responses.Would've given it 5 star if it wasn't for this problem.  Can't watch TV like this, having to set up channel and preferences every 30 minutes.UPDATE:It wasn't a store-mode but a defective item.seller wouldn't reply to my messages which I left several times.later found out that the seller don't accept returns on the items but give exchange.But wait, they don't even do that for TVs bigger than 27\"For this TV, only way you can get it fixed is via Manufacturer's warranty per seller.To make the matter worse, the manufacturer's warranty doesn't cover for shipping in and out to get it repaired/exchangedwhich means $100~200 more out of your pocket in case you get a defective item as I did.So beware and if you still want to get this TV, hope you wouldn't get a damaged good like I did.UPDATE: (changed the rating to 3 from 1)Seiki released a firmware update.  People can download it from their site.This will fix the set-up screen popping up.  Yet, this still won't keep the aspect setting.Thus, only 3 stars...", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Buy on Great T V!", "Author": "Gerald A.

Cable and netflix hooked up right off the HDMI cables. Just pleased all around with no gripes. If it holds up over time it will be a great buy!

I say NO WAY, don't buy it.
