But, I will have to say that Amazon did a great job in refunding me.  They make it very easy to return a faulty product and my credit card was reinbursed in a few weeks.Round two:I finally have a working set and I love it.  This TV is made for the digital age.  I use it with my computer, my XBox 360, I watch movies with it, and I could hook it up to cable if I wanted.--------------------------------I was so excited when I found this deal.  This TV was exactly what I was looking for.  I received it yesterday and it worked halfway through its first movie and hasn't worked right since.  It's like it freezes or something.  The picture stops and then slowly goes grey.  When this happens I can't even access the menu or adjust the volume.  I have to just shut it off.  If I let it \"rest\" for a few hours it will work for a few minutes and then go gray again.I have to assume that my TV is a lemon, and if it worked I would give this item a much higher rating.  I was very happy with the picture (while it was working), and set itself looks slick.", "Date": "November 19, 2005"}, {"Title": "This TV does not work, not worth the good deal", "Author": "Lisa \"Lisa\"", "ReviewID": "R1BLMOE6JVXOBL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I didn't buy this from Amazon but I wanted to post a review.  We got ours at Circuit City and either we got a Lemon or the TV is just made poorly.  It worked great for the first few weeks and then I noticed that after watching for more than 2 hours the screen would go black.  The Cable and everything else was fine but no picture.  As the weeks went by it kept getting worse and worse in shorter amounts of time.  Finally, my husband returned it to the store for a full refund.  When we called Magnavox they told us we would have to ship it to them so they could refurbish it and we would have to pay for the shipping to Magnavox.  Forget that, after paying good money for a product, it shouldn't break after 2 weeks of use.  Buy a different TV, this one was extrememly disappointing :(", "Date": "February 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good TV - BAD monitor", "Author": "Ragtop Girl", "ReviewID": "R3T7MQRMV2OHFC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this remanufactured, but the problem is the same if you want to use as a monitor.  Works great as tv - poor computer monitor.  I ordered this to use as a monitor for my laptop and also has a tv.  However, the ONLY computer resolution it can use is 800x600 which on a 19\" screen is way too grainy and made my eyes hurt.  I discussed with Maganavox tech and admitted it was a problem.  I returned and am now shopping for a computer monitor with tv tuner.", "Date": "February 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "This thing is great!", "Author": "J. Haggard", "ReviewID": "R20NBEZ9ZBDDJA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV on Black Friday in 2005, it was on sale for like $150 at the time at my local target and I was lucky enough to get the very last one the store had!!This TV is great! The picture is crystal clear and it has all the inputs needed for Hi-Def (I don't use), PC (don't use that jack either) and plain old coax for basic cable (this is my choice!)The sound on the TV is amazing comapred to my previous 13\" tube TV. The entire room is filled and it doesn't sound like the sound is coming from the TV, it sounds like it is coming from the entire side of the room where the TV sits, it really is amazing.My only complaint, the power button on the TV, you turn it off and you need to turn it back on from the TV, to get the remote to work you must turn it off via remote. Also, the remote itself is cheap, but I didn't buy it for the remote. I bought it for the TV!!I love it! It was hanging on my wall and it looked great, recently took it down to put it on a bookshelf.", "Date": "August 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "Nice TV but expensive to repair", "Author": "Randi", "ReviewID": "R2GTEFY5GI8S35", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We bought a refurbished model with a 3 month warranty. We kept the TV in a room where it got very little use but we were happy with how it looked and its usability. After 4 months, the volume got stuck on VERY LOUD. Magnavox  tech support talked me through but nothing worked. I took it to the service center they recommended. For $85 they soldered some loose connections, gave me a 1-month warranty.  I brought it home yesterday and it appears to work now. I will not buy another Magnavox TV or another refurbished product.", "Date": "February 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!", "Author": "David R.

Saunders", "ReviewID": "R1D68P9B2EM0XK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this little TV on clearance at a Target store at least six years ago, and until last year it was my bedroom TV. It didn't get heavy use, but has always worked quite well. I think it's a very attractive unit.I played \"musical TVs\" last year when I got a new TV for the living room and moved the 1-year-old HDTV to the bedroom, replacing this 20\" set. So I've been using this TV in my study, hooked up to my living room cable box with a RiteAV - Audio Video RCA Cable 12ft, so I can watch TV when on the computer.This TV is still working flawlessly after six years. I thought I'd post this review because several people posted reviews about having the units fail on them, to show that at least one of these little TVs is still going strong.", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV For the price", "Author": "SAM FRIEDMAN \"Sam\"", "ReviewID": "R1NHZKI23S1VZE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased this LCD TV For around $400.00 and it is great for viewing tv and Gaming.

We'd turn it off for a few seconds, then turn it on again and get picture for 10 minutes. I took it to a service center recommended by Magnavox and paid $50 for them to tell me that they could not find a problem. I brought it home and it worked fine for about 6 months, now there is no picture at all, just sound. Magnavox told me to take it to another service center and they were not willing to help me except to direct me to pay someone else to look at it again. I strongly DO NOT RECOMMEND this product because of poor service. Now we have a flat screen radio....Shame on you MAGNAVOX.
