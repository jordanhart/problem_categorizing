But the cord they give you is not the correct cord for the TV so you will have to go buy one yourself and it doesn't come with a stand and it is very hard to find. Other than that the TV is very nice to look at and watch.", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY INSIGNIA!", "Author": "Admac", "ReviewID": "RM0DDPERA7Q9R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Three years ago we purchased an Insignia DVD player. Now it is outdated and will not play new Blu rays . We called Insignia regarding this, and they said tough luck. One manager went as far as you say the customer is always wrong. Please spread the word on this share this with everyone you know. I can't believe a company would be so awful. After 3 years a Blu ray player will not work on new movies anymore . That is ridiculous not to mention it's environmentally harmful to make an electronic that will only last three years ! Please share this with everyone. Do not buy Insignia!", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "ALWAYS FREE SHIPPING WITHIN THE USA", "Name": "Insignia NS-26L450A11 26\" LCD HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41W%2BjiB5ugL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004H1VFNO"}}
