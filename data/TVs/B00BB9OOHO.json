Right out of the box the picture was amazing. It found my wireless network right away and I had no problem connecting. Updating the software was a breeze.I almost didn't buy this set because I could not find any reviews on it.... or even much documentation. Some information was missing from LGs own specifications. I finally decided to take a chance because I wanted a 60 inch set. As far as I can see so far the LG 60LN6150 seems to have the very same specifications as the LG 55LN5700 line except that it has Picture Wizard 2 and the stand to the 60LN6150 swivels and the others are stationary. I am taking away one star because although I love the set, the documentation is very poor. It comes with a Owner's Manual but NO Users Guide! This makes it very difficult to learn how to use features of the set. There is an onscreen users guide but is a hassle to have to go back and forth between screens when you are trying to set everything up. It would be much easier to have a printed users guide in front of you to refer to. Unfortunately I had problems with Amazon's shipping process (unusual for Amazon) but now that I finally have the set I love it.", "Date": "June 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Picture Quality -", "Author": "MPH", "ReviewID": "R3LTI1I9H5AU27", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the tv for a month now, and i am still amazed at the picture quality.The documentation is somewhat lacking, and appears to be geared more toward people with some technical background, but with a little common sense, and help from the onscreen users guide (or maybe an internet searched for additional info), i believe most people can figure how to operate the many excellent features of this tv.  It does have an onscreen users guide which can be helpful in you're not sure about certain features of the tv.  The shipping process was a breeze, and the delivery people offered to help setup the tv, if you like.  I just had them leave it a the door bacause i wanted the fun of opening it up and setting it up myself.  The only setup required was screwing in a few screws to put on the base.  The only problem I had with the whole process was figuring out how to turn off the TruMotion feature, which makes some shows and movies look like soap operas (TruMotion).  The TruMotion (120Hz) is turned on by default.  You can turn it off by going to settings -> Picture -> Picture Option - >TruMotion, and select off.  I previously only owned Plamsa tvs, because the picture quality was always better than LCD.  But, now with the new LED TV's, the picture quality compares to Plasma.  And LED uses very little electiricty compared to Plasma.  And the LED TV weights less than Plasma TV's.  If this TV holds up like my previous Plasma TV's, then i will continute to purchase LED TV's in the future.

I Love it. Especially the network/ connectivity/ smart TV features!  If you like downloading your movies, music..etc & all your medias is in your computer then the LG smart TVs are for you my friend.  When this tv is connected to your home network(EZ to do) you can access all of your music, movies, photos & watch them on your LG tv.  Best thing about this TV is when playing a video file, if you have the smart remote, you can use it like a mouse & click on any point(time line) of the video/movie like in media player on computer. You don't have to wait for fast-forword like before!!  very cool.ProsPlays all video formats I needed so far (avi, mp4, mkv,) awesome video player.Great smart TV/ connectivity to network, netflix, PLEX, internet, etcVery nice clean Design, I like the all-chrome of the 55LA7400 better but....TV Turns on quickly, a lot faster than Vizio, navigating & changing source/function is also quicker then most.Picture is just as good any other top brands... samsung, sony, etcCONDid not come with the smart remote MR400. a Must Have!! I knew so I bought one separatelyFYINot 3dScreen is a little shinny/glare,  make sure your windows & lights could be covered/ turned off.Frame is silver on front but black on side edgesI meant to give it 4 1/2 stars but can't do that on amazon", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best TV of 2013", "Author": "Da Xue", "ReviewID": "R1A75OROLAT91G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not big on 3D and 4K because I'm getting old(er).  My requirements are features, picture quality, and sound quality and all I have to say is WOW.  Supports nearly everything I want in a TV (DLNA, YouTube, Playing External Storage).  Setup is somewhat fancy especially with all the LG branded services but not over the top.  Game mode with good latency and AV Sync.  The backlight modulation works very well.  Highly recommended.  Supports MHL.  Plug in a wireless keyboard and mouse and you have a basic web browser.  It's not very fast since the system on a chip they use are much slower than the ones in your phone.  I can't wait to see future iterations.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent smart tv", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"jazz_chana\"", "ReviewID": "R1SEAX6DOR486X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent tv with an excellent price.

I would compare this TV at par with Samsung 6300 series. I have 2 Samsung TVs and was in market for 3rd LED tv for my living room. I looked around a lot but finally zoomed in on this LED set. This has amazing picture quality and is smart TV with great features. Setup was easy and picture is superb out of box. I hooked my tv to my Blu-ray player and experience was just superb.Samsung quality has gone down a lot. That's what happens when the manufacturer just becomes too big. LG is still behind Samsung and Sony and are competing hard for first or second spot. They have decent TVs that are coming up and is going to major player in coming years. I certainly recommend this TV.

No manual or setup instructions. No remote control, so if I do get it set up using borrowed hardware I'll still not be able to assess the usability.  I contacted Amazon and they said I had to contact LG in order to get the missing stuff. So I did that, and they informed me it would be 7-10 days before the parts would arrive.  I think that's BS - they messed it up they should next day it.  I'm a heavy-duty Amazon prime user, and this is really my first bad experience but it may preclude me from ordering big ticket items in the future.When the parts arrive and I can actually judge the quality of the TV, I'll return and edit this review.  But for now, I'm not at all happy.Revising - parts arrived on 12/24/13.  There was no manual, but it's available on line.  I must say the manual isn't really all that helpful anyway, but the user interface on the television is very intuitive.  I don't have the magic remote - this was optional and I decided to wait to purchase that (over $100) until I assessed whether or not I need it.  There is an app for smart phones that makes your phone work like a touch pad interface with the TV that is really great, so I think I'll save that 100 bucks for something else. The Amazon app works wonderfully, with lots of free content available for Prime members.In summary, I love the TV - stopping short of 5 stars because the picture on my Sharp Aquos Quattron 60\" is slightly better - but the user interface on the LG is superior.  I also purchased an LG soundbar with it, and they interact nicely.  Unrelated note - I have the identical sound bar connected to the Sharp, too, and they are quite compatible.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "no medialink(PLEX)", "Author": "Jsinghroy", "ReviewID": "R2MHPAEDCA05CX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I just picked up my 60LN6150 television.  The TV has a great picture and excellent features with no 3D(I do not like 3D). I bought the 2013 over the 2012 TV for two main reasons: Miracast support and PLEX integration(medialink). These where the deciding factor for me over samsung smart tv. However the problem is that LG has dropped the medialink and PLEX support in favor of strictly DNLA.  I am furious at LG for this as this was no mention anywhere in their documentation on the LG.com site of the change to platform.I suggest if you want a better smart tv platform to go with Samsung smart tv.
