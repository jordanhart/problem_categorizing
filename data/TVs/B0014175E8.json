Like others, I was wary of making such a large purchase online.  Low price + no sales tax and free shipping made up my mind. After seamlessly receiving the TV 4 days after ordering it, it broke withing 3 hours of being delivered (there was a loud snap-like sound), and there was no power.  I immediately contacted Amazon, who told me to contact Samsung directly, and if they could not handle my concerns, call back.  Samsung dispatched a technician to my house 4 days later, who told me that he \"thought\" it was a defective power card, and that it would take 1 - 2 weeks to get the part and come back for repair.  Now I think most of you will agree that you wouldn't want a TV that was refurbished after just 1 day.  Samsung refused to replace it, saying their policy is to repair, not replace.  I then emailed Amazon, asking for a new television, giving the above explanation.  When I called for an update the next day, my issue had already been escalated, and a new TV was about to ship, no questions asked, at 0 cost to me.In the end, I have Amazon did everything I asked and more, including crediting my price 4 times, from 1700 all the way to 1469.  The biggest fear in buying something like this online is, \"what if it breaks???\"  Well, mine did break, and if you buy from Amazon, you can be sure that you will be happy in the end no matter what.", "Date": "April 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV at a Great Price", "Author": "Tyler Durden \"Caldwell_12\"", "ReviewID": "R222JTDW7HFIOJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First things first, I ordered this TV directly from Amazon and within a few days the price dropped and Amazon refunded the difference.  Awesome!  Amazon's White Glove delivery service delivered as promised and was OK to deal with; no issues at all.  So for those of you wondering whether it is better to spend a few hundred bucks to order this set from a brick and mortar store; keep your money in your pocket and order from Amazon.As for the TV, I am not a video expert type, but I do research big ticket items thoroughly before buying.  This set and the previous generations received great reviews.  However, I was torn between plasma and LCD.  Being a big sports fan (lots of fast moving action on the screen) I had been leaning towards plasma.  But the reviews of this set and the benefits of LCD over plasma (lighter, uses less energy, no risk of burn in and better for well lit rooms) made me make the plunge.Overall, I am extremely satisfied.  This is my first HDTV and I am using Directv HD service and the picture is outstanding.  It is sharp, bright and overall beautiful.  The only issue I have, which I was worried about with the LCDs, is that I do notice some pixelation when scenes move very fast (Thus 4 instead of 5 stars).  However, it is not distracting but I do notice it.The speakers are not as bad as some of the reviews would indicate.  You just need to set the equalizer to the right settings.  I have a home theatre set up so this is not a big issue, but to some it is so I thought I would comment on them.The set looks great, is easy to set up and I am very, very, very happy with my purchase.  Especially at this  price.  With my extra money I was able to buy a nice stand for the Samsung.I hope this helps.", "Date": "April 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "5 star performance, plus a few personal thoughts and tips", "Author": "B Rice", "ReviewID": "RAPZ8OVS6KT31", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Why I bought this set:My old tube TV suddenly burnt out, I guess it sensed that the change was in the air...  I originally wanted to go with a 42\" 720p set, but my partner insisted on getting a 1080p TV so \"We'd be ready for the (near) future.\"  After reading many reviews, I learned that you won't appreciate the 1080p hi-def on a set that's less than 42\".  So I started to look for a 46\" 1080p TV, and my budget was [$...].  I first looked at 4661/4665 models, but soon realized that they were being replaced by the 46A550.  Even though this is a 5 series TV that replaced two 6 series TVs (well, sort of, consider the 4/5/6/7 classification is new for 2008), the 46A550 trumps its predecessors in specs, mainly the contrast ratio.  You might have read that the contrast ratio varies from one manufacturer to another since there's no standard for measuring, so it didn't matter too much for me.  I also read that 4661/4665 had some firmware issues, and at the time of purchase, they were actually more expensive than 46A550 on Amazon.  So 46A550 became the clear winner.Performance:So far so good.  It's important to note that I currently do not have any HD input-just the standard cable signal and Wii via composite cables.  Of course the picture quality is OK at best, but I am hardly complaining as I have faith in the set.  Because this set is new (mine was assembled on March 31st and arrived to my house 10 days later), there aren't many extensive reviews online yet.  Usually, the Sony sets lead the pack in comparison reviews, but they usually cost [$...] more than the runner-up.  To my eyes, the Sony tends to display more details and Samsung  does a better job delivering vibrant color and contrast. One might look slight better than the other, depends on your preferences, when they are next to each other.  But either one would look fantastic just by itself.Interface:The menu is pretty easy to navigate through, and options are where you'd expect.  However, because there's no dedicated PIP button, it was a little difficult to activate that.  You'd have to either go through Menu or press the Tool button on the remote, then go down the menu and activate that feature.  Also, I am not the biggest fan of the remote.  It has back-lit feature, but in order to have all the buttons lit-up, Samsung gives us big soft rubbery buttons.  Some of these buttons can get stuck if you press hard, and I am yet to use the back-lit feature cuz I usually have a light on in the room.  The IR sensor can also be improved.  It is located at the bottom right corner of the frame.  My room isn't huge, so sometimes I am a little \"too close\" to the TV, and the remote wouldn't work because it is not aiming straight at the sensor.  If the sensor was in the middle of frame, it'd probably work better.  The aforementioned \"imperfections\" are definitely not deal-breakers.Experience with Amazon and EGL shipping:Like last time, it was a good experience this time.  Amazon had very competitive price in the first place, and the 30-day price protection feature was a plus.EGL shipping came on time.  They delivered the TV to the room, put it on my stand and plugged in to make it worked fine.  Noting to complain whatsoever.Tips on extended warranty:This TV comes with a 1yr service/labor warranty.  If anything goes wrong, you do not need to ship it back.  Instead, call Samsung and they will send a technician out to repair it on site.I thought it'd be a good idea to get some extended warranty (say, 3 year?) on this [$...] toy.  At the time of purchase, Amazon offered two 3-yr ext. warr. options on this particular model-Option 1 is from a 3rd party vendor (with the envelop and seal logo) and Option 2 one from Samsung (with a Samsung logo).  Option 1 was slight cheaper, but didn't receive very good ratings on Amazon, while Option 2 had no ratings at all.  Option 2 didn't even have thorough explanation on what's covered and what's not.After lengthy research, i found out that the \"Samsung ext. service\" was really offered through Service Net ([...]), and they told me the fine prints of the warranty can be found at ([...]).  The 3-yr Samsung plan through Amazon overlaps the first year manufacturer's warranty, so really you are only getting 2 extra years out of the deal.  Service Net sells their versions of the \"Samsung 3yr ext. warranty\", which really gives you 3 additional years after the first year, but is way WAY more expensive.  Don't know why...None of the above sounded like a sure-sell to me, so here's what I did.  I found out that my Visa card has a feature called Warranty Protection.  Basically it extends the original manufacturer's warranty for another year.  'n at the end of the 2nd year if you wish to extend the warranty even further, Visa offers an additional 3-yr plan that's about [$...].  You can call your bank and/or Visa regarding this feature.Hope my review helps...", "Date": "April 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "My review of the Samsung LN46A550P", "Author": "Roger S. Bullock", "ReviewID": "R1BB27DNTWC06P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, here's my review of the Samsung LN46A550P 46-inch 1080p LCD HDTV.A little over a year ago I bought a Samsung 214T-21.3\" monitor for my big computer.I've been extremely happy with its performance and quality.  So much so, I decided on a Samsung monitor for my movie watching experience.I bought the LN46A550P to replace a 20 year old 50\" Mitsubishi.  The 50\" TV was excellent in its day but it was old and had some issues.  Obviously, it was time for retirement.After doing a week and a half's worth of research I decided on the Series 5 for four main reasons:1)  30,000:1 Dynamic Contrast Ratio - The higher, the better picture quality.2)  5ms Response Time - The amount of time any given pixel on the screen takes to  change from one color to another.  For game playing this is a must.3) Appearance - it is a handsome looking piece of furniture!4) PriceThe day the monitor arrived I took the lid off the shipping container and felt that the monitor was cool to the touch.  After all, it spent about 10 days in a cold truck and 3 more days in a warehouse before it was delivered to my home.  Because of that, I opted to unpack the monitor and let it sit in my living room for a day or so before plugging it in.I live in a mobile home that has a moderately sized living room.  If I had purchased a bigger set, I'd be too close to the action.  It would be like being too close to the screen in a movie theatre. (not good)For optimum viewing it is best to place the monitor at the same height as your head if you were sitting in your favorite chair about 6 to 8 feet away.  I've seen pictures of this monitor mounted on a wall much higher up and further away from the viewing perspective and wondered if the people watching a movie would get a sore neck.  Having such a setup reduces the movie watching experience as well.The monitor's subsystems are accessed through a Microsoft Windows-like menu making it easy for anybody to access its features.I do recommend disabling the monitor's speakers within the monitor's menu system.The monitor's speakers are fine for average viewing but fall short in providing booming sound for movies.I have my monitor connected to an amplifier.  This is done by connecting cables from the left and right audio channel output jacks behind the monitor to the amplifier's audio input jacks.My Nintendo Wii is connected to my monitor via a Component cable for maximum video clarity.  The Wii's audio cables are also plugged into the monitor and the sound the Wii makes is routed through the monitor's electronics to the amplifier.  I included this information in my review for all you gamers.In studying the manuals you will notice right away that the quick setup guide warns that if you experience any difficulties with the monitor NOT TO SEND IT BACK TO THE PLACE OF PURCHASE.  Instead, it instructs you to call SAMSUNG.  Samsung offers in-home service for monitors larger than 30 inches during the warranty period.In the near future I plan to purchase a Sony Blue Ray player (BDPS300).  It is a second generation BD player that steps DVD movies up to 1080p.Care and Maintenance:ALWAYS use a micro fiber clothe to clean an LCD display to avoid scratching its surface.  Samsung includes a micro fiber clothe with the monitor but no cleaning solution.  You will need some good cleaner, like; \"Monster ScreenClean LCD Display Cleaner 2 Bottle Screen Clean Mini Package (MPC CLNKIT-SM)\" found here on Amazon.com.I use that cleaner to keep my computer LCD monitors clean.  It leaves no dirt or dust behind after cleaning.I gave this monitor 5 out of 5 stars with only one recommendation for Samsung; keep the audio output jacks in the back of the monitor but remove the built-in speakers.  People who buy such a monitor have amplifiers and movies in mind.One Special Note:On the shipping container you will see a liquid-filled sticker in the shape of a pyramid that says, \"Tip & Tell\".  If the tip of the pyramid is blue it means the monitor was tipped over during shipping.  In that case, make sure the delivery company makes note of it on the delivery invoice!!!  My monitor was tipped but I saw no damage to the container at all.  My monitor has no visible damage either and works perfectly.  Makes me wonder what happen?  Either way, I'm cover under warranty!Register the monitor with Samsung as well and keep the receipts in a safe place.Roger.

The price was right (1699$) at the time purchase (4-3-2008) for this set. 30,000:1 contrast ratio with more ports and cable slots than I myself could fill with all 3 video game systems this generation and a peripheral DVD player.The image is extremely clear with no banding or ghosting whatsoever (but like any HDTV don't stare at the screen from point blank). HD channels come in crisp and clear, and blacks look very black, not greyish like my older Sharp LCD's TV displays. They don't have any high definition movie player yet, but we are working on it.Another thing for those interested in wall mounting. The whole TV is less than 60 pounds. I held it up myself while my dad mounted it to the wall.Also it's easy to carry up stairs (you don't need to have an expensive moving company do anything for you or mount it if you are sufficiently skilled with such things).Like the other reviewer said however, the speakers are very underwhelming, in comparison to the rest of the setup.

For the first week, it was AWESOME. I was amazed at the Over-the-air HD quality. Then.. while I was watching it one day a week later, it just shut off on me.. then proceeded to turn off and on by itself every three seconds. This Samsung LCD 46 TV LN46A550 was broken - it kept on turning on and off on and off on and off every 3 seconds if it was plugged into the wall. Since it has a one year warranty, I called support. Technical Services arrived at my house 2 full weeks later to fix it. They could not fix it that day because they said *somehow* some timer board fried and they did not have the part - they needed to order it. So I'm still waiting for them to come back. FYI - there are SEVERAL cases similar to this (goto answers.yahoo.com). I've missed the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics and more.

Bacon", "ReviewID": "R3AXRB28MQQV7F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After window shopping, reading online reviews, and spending countless hours in front of every flat panel display out there, it was finally time to make a decision last week.  The initial debate was plasma vs. lcd.  Plasma technology typically offers great black levels and the newer sets don't have the same issue of deteriorating picture quality over time as some of the previous models.  LCD typically offers a more vivid picture with slightly less aggressive black levels.  Personal preference after viewing new sets from all of the manufacturers led me straight to the new Samsung 550 and 650 series.  The picture quality is simply amazing!  The main difference of these two sets is the series 650 offers 120hz processing.  While it is intreging, to me personally, it actually leans towards a bit distracting and unnatural.  Digital processing that fills in the \"gaps\" of the frames from a typical 3:2 pulldown is the reason for this unnatural feel and, while there are various settings for the level of artificial frame insertion, it just isn't a feature that is compelling enough to justify the price difference to me.  That is just my opinion and some people really enjoy the artificial \"smoothness\" of the frames on the 120hz set...make your own determination if this feature is compelling enough to spend the extra dollars.  So, once I determined the 650 wasn't the right fit for me, the obvious choice was to get almost the exact same feature set minus the 120hz processing and save a bundle of cash with the 550 series.The 550 gives you so much for the money that I almost felt bad for only having to pay $[...] for such incredible picture quality...I said almost!  The colors are rich and vivid and the picture is highly customizable to your preferences.  I found the standard picture setting right out of the box to be suitable for almost all types of viewing, blu-ray through PS3/HDMI, HDTV cable through component, and even upconvert standard DVDs, with only a minor adjustment to the black level.  By the way, the black level adjustments are very easily found in the picture menu and allow 4 different settings of off, low, medium and high, so you don't have to make any major adjustment to your bright and contrast settings or get out your decoder ring to figure out the right scheme for you.  The black levels on this set are simply amazing for an LCD!This new 550 is replacing a 3 year old 46\" Samsung DLP 720p.  At that time, the LCD technology simply wasn't up to par and the \"screendoor\" effect was noticeable in even the very high end sets, so DLP was the right choice for me at that time.  I have to say my DLP, although 3 years old, is a great set and offers a fantastic picture, but when I hooked up the new 550, which takes less than 5 minutes from unboxing, batteries in the remote and connections from components (I will be wall-mounting the set next week), I was absolutely blown away when comparing to my old DLP.  Wow, instant gratification and assurance this was a fantastic choice to bring into my home!  Great clarity, bright image with natural tones and virtually no shadowing or artifacts detectable.Quick note about the sound quality and speakers.  Some of the reviews will knock the sound of the televisions speakers...they are just fine and produce adequate and appealing sound.  I have 7.1 surround, so it would be completely unfair to compare.  It's really simple though, if you currently listen to your tv through your tv speakers, this set should be at least as good as your current set up.  If you have component audio with 5.1/7.1 and you are trying to compare them to the 550's speakers, you will obviously be disappointed.  I think most people are getting into home theater setups with component audio at this point, so why worry about the tv speakers anyway?!?!Bottome line, I would say this a great tv for the money, but that isn't really fair.  This is a great tv...period, regardless of price point!  There are plenty of sets out there that are easily $[...] more that don't offer picture quality this good.  It's a no-brainer...most bang for the buck that you will be able to find in a 46\" 1080p LCD.  It's almost like going to a car dealership with the intention of taking a BMW off the lot, but you get there and are pleasantly surprised to find out you only have to pay as much as you would for a Honda to get it!  All of the benefits of a premium price tv with an incredible price point.

The bottom line is that you get incredible picture quality for a very low price.  The colors were a little too intense out of the box but a few adjustments using the on-screen menu controls remedied that.  Now it just looks wonderful.  As others have said, the sound is mediocre.  I think the problem is that the speakers point down, not out.  I guess they didn't want to ruin that very stylish, \"minimalist\" look of the set.  We have the set mounted inside of a cabinet, so those downward-pointing speakers tend to result in muffled sound or echoes.  We just play the TV through our audio receiver, so it's fine.

Gryder", "ReviewID": "R2162RL8NUMBMF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received my LN-46A550 on April 29th and absolutely love this set. I am coming from a Samsung HP-S4253 42\" plasma that I've owned for two years. That set was always a strong performer with great black levels and a decent 720p picture. But after living with that TV for a while, I began to get frustrated with the constant threat of burn-in and the TV just had to go. I'm a heavy gamer and I knew that I needed to go with LCD.About a month ago, I got on the AVS forums and asked for those guy's recommendations for a good set. This 550 came up time and time again, so I took the plunge and ordered the 40\" version. It took less than a week from Amazon and CEVA did a great job of delivering and unpacking the set. Yet soon after CEVA left, I noticed a single dead pixel, and I ordered a replacement from Amazon. They were very understanding in the matter and very quick to accept the replacement order. [*Quick side note, Samsung considers \"a few\" dead pixels \"normal\" and will not replace things as easily as Amazon did. I simply explained this to Amazon and they ordered the replacement, no questions asked!] By the time I had decided to replace the 40\", I said what the heck, and I got the 46\" instead.CEVA again came out, packed up the old TV and dropped off the new one. Ever since then, I've been in love. This is the first LCD I've ever owned that did not have a dead pixel, clouding, flash-lighting, banding, or any of the other many problems a LCD can have. The set looks absolutely fantastic inside and out. The bezel is very sleek with the piano black finish. I had always enjoyed this on my plasma and I still like it on this LCD. The bezel is also very thin, so it feels as if the screen is even bigger than it is. The chrome finish on the bottom is very attractive as is the small LED blue light that shines from just under center. The small light fading when the set powers down was a very nice touch as well.I also really enjoy having a swivel base. My HP-S4253 was always stationary, so it made things very difficult if you were sitting far off of center or if you had to adjust some cords behind the TV. Now with my 550, I can swivel the TV to watch anywhere in the room and also very easily get to my connections in the back. All of the connections are conveniently located on the back left side of the TV, and it takes one quick swivel to have access to everything.Now for the picture. All I can say is WOW. If you're familiar with the quality of LCDs over the past few years, you'll really appreciate how fantastic this TV looks when correctly calibrated. The black levels are comparable to my old Samsung Plasma. They are by no means \"pitch black\" or \"inky\", but very, very close to my Plasma's picture quality. I can now watch movies in 2.35:1 and not be able to see the black bars because they are truly black. I also am free of the worries of burn-in or retention of those black bars. It's a wonderful feeling.The brights are impressive as well. Very impressive! If you aren't careful, in a dark room this 550 can cause eye strain. I recommend some ambient lighting while viewing this set haha. All in all, this is a good thing. Sports and brighter colorful movies have a lot of \"pop\" to them, which is something my plasma could never do. In a movie likes Cars, the plasma always looked kind of muddy and bland, whereas this LCD looks incredible!! I am extremely pleased with the picture quality of this set.Overall, you'd have to be a fool to not realize the value of this television. Two years ago I spent roughly $2,500 on a 42\" plasma with a noticeably worse picture. Today I can spend over $1,000 LESS than that and get a 46\" set with a superior picture. Amazon gets two thumbs up in my book! They handled everything flawlessly and the customer service was great as always. I also give credit to CEVA for their kind employees and prompt service. This was a great purchasing process and one that no one should be afraid of. If you're in the market for a TV that is full of value, without all of the unnecessary fluff out there today, I say dive in and get this 550!", "Date": "May 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great picture", "Author": "Jojy George Varghese \"jojygv\"", "ReviewID": "R34S2NPKAT86TJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I first bought a Samsung 4665 46 inch.

Blacks are deep blacks, colors are sharp and crisp.Remote control with big buttons is very user friendly and for a change even the user manual is well written.

THEY HAVE NO REFUND POLICY ON LARGE TVS NO MATTER HOW BAD IT IS, AND THE DELIVERY GUY DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TIME TO TURN IT ON AND TRY IT WHEN ITS DELIVERED.No for the rest.I don't usually write reviews often but this really upset me.  I did a lot of research before I purchased this television.  Almost all the reviewers loved LN46A550, and it received top marks on almost every web site I looked.  Which is why I was very surprised when I turned it on.First the good.1) looks nice2) great contrast ratio and viewing angle3) very bright4) picture from a quality HD source like blue ray dist on a PS3 looks great, AS LONG AS THERE IS NOT MUCH MOTION ON THE SCREEN.Now the bad:1) analog SD TV looks absolutely horrific.  The screen has these faint linear distortions going vertically on most channels, and the picture is very pixelated and blurry,  especially around faces and moving objects.  not every SD channel is equally bad, but all range from horrible to slightly less horrible.  I have optimum HD dual channel DVR box, which works great hooked up to my 6 year old Sony CRT TV. (HD channels look better on my old sony as well).2)image blur with fast moving objects on the screen is VERY VISIBLE, and much worse than on my brothers 4 year old LG set.  Don't believe the fast  5 ms image refresh.  perhaps they get it under lab conditions, but in the real world, almost any fast moving image creates a visible blur.  Forget about watching most sports or action movies.  While thee blur is faint, it is almost always visible, and once you see it you will keep seeing it.  It drives my wife and I nuts.  Our first experience watching a movie was the Golden compass on blue ray (though HDMI).  The scene where the little girl is riding a bear across the nice blue sky backgroung has approximately 1 cm of faint blur trailing behind her.  The large fight scene towards the end of the movie was totally unwatchable due to all the trails.  In fact, both from a blu ray source and on many channels, when the actors face moves slightly on the screen or when they talk, a faint blur tends to appear over the entire part of the face that moved.3) Sound is pretty bad, but if you have a surround sound setup it shouldn't matter.4) Not really a television problem, but more of a problem with the retailer.  I purchased the set through Amazon from 6Avenue electronics, and when I called them to ask for a return, I was denied, saying they NEVER ACCEPT ANY RETURNS ON TVS LARGER THAN 32 INCHES.  They referred me to a line buried in their 30 day return policy which stated that it does not apply to large telivisions.  They said that once I bought it an accepted delivery it was my problem, and I would have to resolve any issues with the manufacturer.  So beware when ordering from them.  I guess customer service means nothing and I will never buy from them again.  I am now stuck with a television which does not perform to the promised specifications and which I can not return.  When I called Samsung, they offered to send a technician to my house, and said they will set me up with a local repair shop.  They also said they don't think there is anything wrong with my set.  It has been 3 days and no repair tech contacted me yet.In conclusion, I would not recommend buying this television if you plan on watching sports or action movies on it, or if you don't have a surround sound system.  And I especially would not recommend buying anything from 6th Avenue electronics.

I simply can't say enough good things about this TV.  I've now watched it under a wide variety of conditions and it has been exceptional under all of them.  During part of the day my living room gets a very large amount of sunshine and using the \"Dynamic\" setting I can change the settings to optimize viewing in those conditions.  Using the remote it is easy to switch from the DVD player to cable and back.Because there are so many reviews here, I thought I would limit the remainder of my comments to a couple of very practical matters.  First, while the TV is visually stunning, you have to keep in mind that it doesn't look nearly as good if you get within six feet of the screen.  Up very close you see some ghost images and some pixilation.  Eight feet away the picture is breathtaking.  So, don't get this size TV if you need to be closer than six feet.  Second, I wanted to share my experience in choosing what size to get.  My living room measures 12' x 17' and I usually sit about eight feet from the TV.  I debated with myself whether to get the the Samsung 46\" or the 52\".  Given my room size and where I wanted to sit, the 46\" has turned out to be just about perfect.  The 52\" might have worked, but I suspect it would have been a tad too large.  If you have a larger area than I do or plan on sitting further away than I do, you might want to get a 52\".  If you have a room similar to mine or a bit smaller, you would probably be happy with the 46\".  If you have a much smaller space, you should perhaps think of a 40\".", "Date": "August 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great picture, high quality, around a grand and a half...this is the one.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RL6XBGGDRKJ18", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tv is remarkable for its price.

I was struggling on whether to go with this or the next one up (touch of color). When the first order was delivered, the guy came in, he set everything up and the set would not power up. So he packed it back up and told me to contact Amazon. My first reaction once the disappointment was over was to be greatful for the white glove service. It would have been a bear to have to ship it back on my own. Amazon was great on arranging a replacement - no hassel or string of dumb questions at all. Same guy delivered the next set and everything powered up fine. My first reaction was that the picture was ......OK. Better than my old set, but something less than the experience I was hoping for. I figured that maybe the set was just too big for the room. My viewing distance at 11' is a little closer than recommended. I was listening for the sound after seeing the complaints in some of the other reviews but  I found the sound to be quite acceptable so I don't understand their complaints at all - especially since there a lot of ways to modify it . In fact pretty much all the functions of the TV can be customized to suit personal tastes.  After a week I ordered High Def from Direct TV - which was always in the plan. Fired up the set and the picture was ..... FANTASTIC !! I can't really overstate the quality of the picture I am now getting. I have had this setup for about a month now  and am still totally blown away every time I see that High Def picture. Especially awsome for football, nature shows, science channel, - aw heck they are all great. I think my original analysis was probably right - with a tv this big you probably want to sit further away if you are getting a standard feed. With the High Def , I swear you could sit 2' away. I have no regrets about not stepping up to the touch of color - I don't see how the picture could be better , but if it is, it probably wouldn't have been worth the cost differential ( about  20% at the time I was buying).

However I felt I would be doing Samsung an injustice not to review this amazing TV. After watching the market and learning about my needs as a consumer for the last year plus I decided to purchase this TV from Amazon. I choose Amazon because of there rock bottom pricing. If you figure in taxes and shipping (delivery) charges from your local electronic shop Amazon has them beat hands down.Pros:-The SDTV looks great, this was a huge fear for me going from a 32\" JVC to the Samsung and I was surprised how great it looks. We sit 6' from the TV and do not suffer from screen door effects, etc.-Anti-Glare: Most TV's we looked at were ultra reflective and made the picture near impossible to see in normal daylight situations.-Sound: after reading the reviews here on Amazon I was really concerned that this near perfect TV would sound like a tin can. And to be honest when I first received it did. However after following the recommendations found in the reviews on this TV and the AVSForums I found it more than suitable in audio quality.-Picture: I have limited knowledge about what is considered \"good\" but the picture is amazing to me.  No screen door effect, the colors are perfect and no issue with blurring.-Delivery: The white glove service is great I was scheduled for a delivery 2 weeks after purchase. I received it a short 4 days later. My TV was shipped out of PA and I live in MA.Cons:-The aspect ratio of the TV for normal SDTV defaults to 16:9, which leaves large blank borders and doesn't use the full screen of the TV. Although you can use the wide fit option under the settings when switching between HDTV and SDTV you have to change back and forth between \"wide fit\" and the native 16:9. Also when the TV auto adjusts between interlace and progressive you get a green screen for a second that frankly freaked me out the first time it happened.-I haven't found any others yet with maybe the exception of the lack of 120hz option known as \"future proofing\". My take on the 120hz thing is its not developed enough to be worth the price difference. Almost every TV including the Samsung's that I have looked at with that feature on had issues with blurring the picture, more specifically during sports games. Many posts state to just turn the 120hz feature off. Leaving them with a xx\" TV at 60hz i.e. my TV.Summary: Overall I highly recommend this TV for the reasons above and because it is a consumer reports best buy in its class 40-46\" TV's. The Anti-Glare is huge for me because I watch it in the living room and have five windows that give us daytime light. The delivery service Amazon uses is efficient and will remove the packaging should you want them to. We held onto our packaging to make sure its the TV we wanted and just threw it away the other day. Finally there is more than enough support for this TV both from Samsung in the form of Customer Service and it's Firmware updates via free USB flash-drive and the AVSForums. Combine all the above with Amazons 30day return/price protection policy and it's win/win.", "Date": "July 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Fantastic TV With Fantastic Options", "Author": "Michael K. Zupan \"mzupeman2\"", "ReviewID": "RLS4QGXRG7W5D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was replacing my old Sony 42A10 Grand Wega Rear Projection LCD.  That's an older set and the black levels were notoriously bad.  After some calibration, I was able to get a decent picture out of it.  Apparantly this line had been lemons though, as optical engine after optical engine being replaced had failed.  Time for a new TV.I was honestly going to go for a Panasonic Plasma originally.  Plasmas are known for great contrast levels.  I've seen 30,000:1 for some plasma contrast levels, but LCD's are catching up and Samsung this year brings out an affordable set that's below the popular $2000 budget, and makes it a breeze to use.Out of the box the color levels aren't bad at all.  Grey scale is actually not too far off from being accurate with the 'movie mode' setting, which takes off most artificial effects to the picture which would really make colors pop un-naturally and crush darker shades of black so you lose some minor detail.  Of course, I did a calibration for this set based on some calibrations done in the AVSForum online and this set at that point blew me away even more.  Samsungs over months and months of figuring out what I should buy between plasma or LCD, or what brand even, have come out on top in picture quality and color reproduction.So there's the praise on the picture, but we all know that if you're serious about an HDTV you need to consider everything else.  The 5ms response time is nice and works just fine with time sensitive games... forget wasting your money on the more expensive sets that give you 4ms response time.  Hundreds of dollars for this and a 50,000:1 contrast ratio alone aren't worth it.  This TV doesn't have 120hz but there's really nothing to say negative about any kind of motion blur, this set holds up extremely well with very very little or no blur at all.How about the ease of use?  The menus are very easy to navigate.  I mentioned I did some calibrating, which usually means you have to go into a service menu that has to be accessed by punching a secret code in a remote.  Then, you're staring at menus that you have no idea what anything means, so if you change the wrong values, you could potentially turn your TV into a large paperweight.  Don't like the new service menu settings, and forgot to write down what the old ones were?  Well, you're screwed.  Especially since service menu tinkering voids your warranty!Not so with this set, and this is my favorite part of the TV's settings since I love to tweak my set:All of the color and white balance options are accessible via the normal user menu.  Change your color mode to custom, and you can change all of your gains and off-sets... and if you don't like what you've done or if you messed up... there's a option in each color menu that says 'Reset'.  Tell me that's not convenient.  If you never wanted to shell out $200-$400 for a professional calibration, and you've always been a little weary of tweaking your service menu... fear no more.The only downside to this set, is that the speakers sound pretty bad.  Most people like myself, already have a surround sound system so this may not be a deal breaker... but the options for the sound can be calibrated to sound decent enough as long as you're patient.Last but not least, Samsung has given us a much larger viewing angle for this LCD than we'd get with normal LCD panels.  Samsung is ahead of the game with LCD's and if you're thinking about LCD (which I did because I game a lot and didn't want to even risk image retention with plasma), Samsung is the way to go.  When Sony is using Samsung parts now-a-days, you know that's gotta mean good things, right?  Great contrast, good black levels, good viewing angle, lots of HDMI and component inputs, can't ask for much more than that.", "Date": "June 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Samsung 46 550 Review", "Author": "Adam Burns", "ReviewID": "R10LDAAOZTT3UA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, this is a great tv.

Dynamic is the best. Also, there is this entertainment video option where it has sports, cinema, and game. The game is great for video games that have alot of colors and needs the best dynamic contrast ratio.Shipping. Free shipping is nice. It took about a week. It is white glove. However, it is now how Amazon described it, or not in my area. They call two days before telling you a day (can't pick the day you want). The next day they call you with a 2 hour time window that night. Not great for if your schedule is rigid or have to have someone cover for you. They did deliver fast. They bring it in, unbox it, and take the box. Mine did not hook anything up besides the power cable. They left it unhooked when I had all the video cables ready. They just check to see if it powers on. I had no trouble, but the shipping option was less than what I expected.Games: Original xbox looks amazing at 1080p with component. Wii does not look great. I have the component and it does make the menu color and detail become crisp, but games like Wii Sports Tennis made the grass not look as good as SD. The ps3 was amazing. I tested out GTA4 and Planet Earth Blu-Ray and it is amazing. Make sure to set the hd settings on all your game systems before you start the games.Cable: I have comcast cable and the hd package. I have it connected with hdmi and it looks great. Most of your local channels like fox, abc, and cw will be full out 1080i (yes 1080i) and will look great. There are quite a bit of shows that are upscaled. They look good-great depending on the age of the video and the channel. Alot of these upscaled will not be in widescreen. You will be able to tell these upscaled channels because they are pixelated slightly.Warranty: No problems yet. *knock on wood* Samsung does offer in home white glove repair for one year. It does not cover things like lightning strikes, accidents, or minor dead pixels. It basically covers if things go wrong with the tv that you had no part in causing. This service is available for LCD HD tv's 36 and up.Great tv. I recommend getting this tv. I did not want to go to Best Buy and spend two grand for the tv, tax, shipping, and warranty. I spend about two thirds what Best Buy would cost and I am happy as can be. Overall, just do you research on quality and all the aspects about the sale.

And among LCD HDTVs I was looking at Samsung and Sony only. I found that Samsung's pricing and features are perfectly interleaved with Sony models and hence a Samsung seemed to give me the best bang for the buck within my budgetary threshold.

More expensive TVs have a 4ms response rate. Also I did ponder over the 60Hz refresh rate on this TV but I don't think its a big deal and in my view it didn't justify the extra bucks you need to put down for a 120Hz. Also I've never experienced motion blur yet, at least for the kind of viewing I do.Amazon did great with my order and the delivery service was smooth and fast.", "Date": "November 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV: Inferior Speakers", "Author": "Liberty4all \"DMZ\"", "ReviewID": "R3NAFU19FY3XU0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "No need to rehash all the positive things that have been said about this TV. The picture is stunning. My gripe concerns the speakers which don't belong on an otherwise 5 star TV like this one. In short, I often find it difficult to clearly hear the spoken word on this TV. I find myself turning it up to do so, but then just finding it's louder, but not actually more understandable. If Samsung has just spent another $25 or so to install higher fidelity speakers (and upped the price accordingly) this would likely be an unqualified 5 star product.", "Date": "July 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV - I would purchase it again and again", "Author": "G. Nagy", "ReviewID": "R17EQFZYS0L1BJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered the LN46A550 from Amazon about 5 weeks ago on a Tuesday night.  I have been wanting to purchase the Samsung 4661F for almost a year now.  When the new model came out and then dropped to a lower price than the 4661, I finally purchased it!  Got a call late Friday afternoon from CEVA and scheduled delivery for the next Tuesday between 2:00pm-6:00pm.  I asked that they call before delivery so I wouldn't miss any work.  They called at 4:30pm, and I met the one delivery guy around 5:00pm at my house.I moved my 17 year old 27 inch Magnavox TV from my TV stand.  He unpacked and setup the new TV.  He hooked up a set of rabbit ears that I had and turned on the set.  He said that Samsung changed the remotes.  This was his first delivery of this model.  I chatted with him, and he told me that he has delivered many HDTVs and the most popular brand seems to be Samsung.  The largest TV he has ever delivered was 70 inches!  I did a quick check of the TV and told him that it looked good to me.  He told me to contact Samsung if I have any issues with the TV.  I signed his sheet and he was off.The family and I looked through the over-the-air HD channels here in Columbus Ohio.  We were amazed at how real the local news people looked.  I noticed one black dot on bottom right of the screen and rubbed it with my finger.  It disappeared so I don't know if it was a spec of dirt or a stuck pixel.  I was immediately surprised that the SD channels looked better than I expected.  I was also surprised how good the picture looked from the side.  The picture had bright whites and dark blacks.  The built-in settings looked pretty good to me.  I like the remote, but it seems like you have to press down harder on the buttons than I am used to.  I thought the speakers sounded fine, definitely much better than my old TV's speakers.  But I do own a Sony 5.1 receiver hooked up to 6 speakers, so I haven't listened to the speakers since the first day.  I purchased HDMI, component, and optic cables from monoprice - they have all worked great and were very inexpensive!The next day after work I visited our local Time-Warner and replaced our old SA8300 DVR with a new SA8240HDC DVR.  I use an HDMI cable from the DVR to the HDMI1 on the TV.  I also use component cables for my 2 year old Panasonic DVD player and our Wii.  I use optical cables for audio from the DVR and from the DVD player.  When I first hooked up the DVR to the TV HDMI1 connection using an HDMI for the video and an optical cable for the audio, the Dolby Digital 5.1 sound would quickly cut in and out on HD channels.  I moved the HDMI cable to HDMI2, and it started to work fine.  I then moved the cable back to HDMI1, and it has continued to work fine.  Not sure what was happening except maybe some possible copy protection issues?Other observations since the first week of ownership:  I notice a slight hum but only if I put my head behind the TV.  I don't notice it from the front of the TV even with the sound off.  Changing the brightness doesn't seem to change the level of the hum - it stays very quiet.  I don't notice any light spilling out of the back of the set, but I can see some of the light tube if you look at the right angle at the back of the TV.  The stand seems to collect alot of dust daily.  I don't notice any smearing, columns, pillarboxes, clounds, or anything else like that.  Over time, I noticed the picture at the default settings had some black crush to things like dark sport coats worn by TV announcers.  So, I have tried two different settings from the avsforum.com website.So bottom line - I love this TV and think the picture quality is great.  I am very happy with it and would purchase it again and recommend it to others.  The last thought I would share is that I can't set the TV to one set of settings and have it look great for all content.  HD shows seem to be of excellent quality consistently, but SD show quality is all over the map.  This doesn't seem to follow by channel but by show or DVD.  Every TV show or DVD seems to have a different quality to it.  Battlestar Galactica on Sci-Fi looks like a YouTube video, but Survivor or most History channel shows look like 4:3 HD quality.  On DVD, movies like Star Wars, Finding Nemo, and even Babe look great.  But other DVDs like Transformers don't look as good.  This could be a function of the DVR, DVD player, or this TV, but I think it really is that the content is created in many different quality settings or compression levels.  To this day, I still flip through the HD channels and say \"Wow, will you look how good that looks!\" no matter if it is content that I enjoy or shows that I don't care for.EDIT#1: I forgot to mention two more items.  First, the TV only makes one small click when turning on and another small click when turning off.Second, I debated about what size of screen I should get.  I am glad I went with the 46 inch.  We sit roughly 8 feet from the screen, and I think 40 inches would have been too small and 52 inches would have been to big.", "Date": "May 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "JUST AMAZING!!!! Great TV!!!

Due to the size and high value of the product, it took a couple extra days longer to get the replacement than would normally be the case (or so I assume), but everything went smoothly and the second unit works perfectly.

If they lost a dude and I pitched in with the carrying (which I might have done anyway, I hate watching others do stuff for me), I could get the delivery the next day (it was last Monday, FYI).  The guy was extremely helpful, set-up was great, I just had to take the packaging out myself (a terrible 50-foot walk to the dumpster, oh no!!).Turned on the tv and was happy as could be.  I used CNET's configuration and fine-tuning to get the picture as good as I can get it and was very pleased (CNET is a great site for research, by the way, use it for any tv!).  The HD picture is great, even if I'm stuck with crap-tastic Comcast for the time being.  I also ordered a combo home theater/upscaling DVD player, so I'll have to see if the picture is decent or not.

Ciruit City, Best Buy and Ultimate Electronics here in the Denver area wanted anywhere from $250 - $400 more than on Amazon.  Free delivery and no tax was also a HUGE bonus, that saved me another $150 that you kinda forget about.  Plus, you can add on HDMI cables that go for $50 most places for a buck.  Not a misprint.The only complaint are the god-awful speakers that sound like some kid in a tree house on a tin-can-on-wire connection.

Because it's over my fireplace, I don't have anywhere to set up a home theater system, and I don't want any cables going to or from the set.  So it's strictly a cable watching TV.After some serious research, I ended up going with this television.  Everything that has been said about the picture is true.  It's beautiful - so I won't say anymore on that.  The exterior design of the television is great with the gloss frame, blue light under the Samsung logo, and the side inputs.  I kinda like the little melody it plays when you turn it on and off (reminds me of my iMac). The mat finish on the screen was a huge selling point for me as the TV is in a room with windows almost directly across from it.  No annoying reflections whatsoever.  It mounted over my fireplace easily with the Peerless SF660 mount.Now for the sound - it's not that great.  As many have said, it's definitely a little tinny sounding and the bass leaves much to be desired.  I did the equalizer settings per the thread found on the avforums website and that helped a little bit. Dialogue is usually pretty good, but music isn't always that great.  I've also noticed it's dependent on the cable channel to a certain extent.  Some are better than others and there's nothing I can do about that.I received the television before the wall mount, so naturally I had to temporarily set it up on a table using just the included stand.  I noticed that because of the downward facing speakers and the design of the case, a lot of the sound is lost out the back of the TV when it is on the stand.  After mounting it on the wall, I found that the sound slightly improved (especially the bass) as the sound is reflected off of the wall surface and into the room.I'm definitely very happy with my purchase!  Although it leaves a lot to be desired, I'm happier with the sound than I thought I would be, especially after getting it hung on the wall.  Don't let other reviews based on the sound deter you.

I also considered the Sony Bravia of the same size screen and similar price range and decided on this one instead, based on the hundreds of reviews I read from other owners.Finally, I would like to say that I purchased this set from Amazon when they were offering the free white glove delivery.  This offer was the biggest deciding factor in whether or not I would purchase here or on another site or retail store.  This service was fantastic; the delivery person placed the TV on the stand and set it up while I made sure I was satisfied with the set.  Knowing I had 30 days to return in the event something went awry gave me extra peace of mind.  Amazon's price was competitive and their service topped other online retailers which offered free shipping but no return warranty if the set were to arrive broken.  For this same shipping service offering free return if broken, other retailers required $200+ more.

The LN46A550 continues Samsung's tradition of higher standards of quality for their TV division, maintaining themselves as a top tier LCD manufacturer, alongside Sony and Sharp (Don't bother looking at other brands, particularly the cheaper ones: they lack reliability or picture quality).  This set offers excellent picture quality for high definition media and TV at a very economical price.  The only caveat is that a separate sound system would be recommended, as the range on the set's speakers is a bit lacking.This will be my fourth Samsung LCD product that I have purchased that I am surprisingly very happy with. My previous LCD HDTV was the LNR268W, a 26\" 1080i set, which I happily owned for two years.  It had great picture quality and surprisingly good sound, but because of the smaller size, the higher resolutions were a bit of a moot point.  After waiting for prices on larger LCD sets (36\"+) to come down some, and comparing many models, I decided on the LN46A550.GOOD:1.  The price of this set delivered cannot be beat.  I had tried haggling with some big box retailers to bring down their pricing, but considering I'd be charged tax, there is no way they would be able to match Amazon's price + no tax + free shipping.  This was my first major electronics purchase (all priors were for smaller items) from Amazon and I was very pleased with the speed and quality of the service.2.  After doing some tuning with the TV's settings using some professionally calibrated picture quality settings found on a thread in AVSforum (A popular forum for high end video fans), the LN46A550 was able to realize a great range of natural colors, contrast, and blacks and whites.  It really brought out the picture and quality of my Blu-Ray discs, standard definition TV, PS3 games, and regular DVDs.  With 5ms response time, I am not noticing as much ghosting as I did with my older 8ms response time set.  Some of the higher end Sony's and Sharps can achieve similar results, but at a significantly higher price.It is of note that many of the preset color and picture quality settings on the TV are already very good, compared with other LCD manufacturers.3.  An awesome number of video inputs.4.  The additional features found in the A650 and A750 models did not seem to offset the increase in price, making the A550 the best buy.BAD:1.  Internal speakers are awful.  I was able to tune them to get passable sound, but they still lack clarity if the volume is cranked up. Either all highs, all lows, or drowned out sound in the middle.  A separate audio receiver and speaker set should be used with this TV.  (If you have a 46\" LCD HDTV and HD media, this is a must)Overall, this is a great set and I am very pleased with it. Despite the poor quality of the internal speakers, the overwhelming quality of the rest of the features give this LCD HDTV a full 5 stars. Samsung has a great reputation for the reliability of their LCD TV products, so I don't anticipate worrying about RMA's like some of the cheaper brands like Vizio, Olevia and Westinghouse that I was considered beforehand.

The two people unboxed it, installed it in my built in cabinet which was about 1/8 inch to small but they made it work. They turned it on and set it up using the automatic channel scan. They hauled off the carton and packaging.  I was really unhappy with the picture quality at that time.  After they left I started adjusting the TV using directions I got from [...].  You have to remember that all TV's are set to full bright because they don't know which one will be a store display and they must be bright to attract the attention.

The one thing I don't like is the fact that you can only change the volume one click at a time.  Maybe they will correct this where you can have a choice in some future software update.

Colors are vibriant but very natual looking. Picture quality is superb on HD content , even on SD content it was impressive. This tv does very well in a well lit room,the anti-glare screen makes a difference. This tv has a ( 5ms ) response time and I find it to be just as good as one with a 120hz automotion. Because of the high contrast ratio ( 30,000:1 ), sports and movies with fast action don't slow the picture down. Samsung has done a great job with this model.

Although I'm not too sure it's a secret now.For the price, you really get a lot of TV. This tv's picture quality is one of the best out there. I have been researching LCD Tv's for months now and this one stands out the most. I was torn between this model and the Sony 46V3000 and I finally was able to see them side by side and their  pictures were almost exactly the same. I could barely notice that the Sony had a little deeper color but only on certain pictures. So when the price dropped to $1499.98 on Amazon I jumped on this TV and have not been disappointed.I would say the some fast moving motion is a little blurred and not a crisp as the Samsung 46a650 with the 120hz refresh and Auto motion plus but I don't feel like I am missing that. Like most people, I agree that that sound on this TV is not very good and takes some adjusting in the settings. After making the adjustments, the sound is much better. My Xbox 360 looks amazing on this TV and I don't notice any trailing or blurring or anything when playing Call of Duty or Madden.Overall, I would say that if you're in the market for a LCD TV for under $2000, then this is the way to go. I have not heard of many hardware problems with this TV and have heard of nothing by postive feedback on this set. I am a very happy customer both by this TV and by Amazon's customer service.

While other TVs may have done slightly better in terms of price, the quality of Samsung televisions have surpassed even Sony in recent years as they consistently rank as one of the top brands. This TV is no different.We were not in need of all the bells and whistles that are advertised on the later models of the Samsungs, such as the 120Hz refresh rate. This feature may smooth out intense sports action but as the human eye can only process a 60Hz refresh rate, the 120Hz will often tire your eyes out after viewing too long (this is why looking at an LCD monitor for a computer too long tires your eyes out).As for its performance, we could not be happier. The Dark Night on Blu-ray played via a PS3 hooked up with HDMI 6FT / 2M Super High Resolution Male to Male Cable by Eforcity looked absolutely stunning. The 1080p resolution on this TV is incredible. People may complain about artifacts and pixelation while watching TV but that issue (which I have experienced) is not the TV itself. The fact that it can play Blu-ray movies at full 1080p resolution flawlessly indicates that the problem lies with the video source. The free HD channels I get as a Time Warner subscriber in NYC look amazing, but they do get a bit pixely sometimes during intense camera movement and action. This is also added to by the fact that even channels that are supposedly broadcasting in HD are using compression techniques that lower the quality on the subscriber's end. Unfortunately there is nothing to be done about it but wait for HD to become the standard. Everything still looks great and I do not regret this purchase in the slightest.

If you do the leg work online, you can find pretty good settings for dynamic, standard, and movie settings. For the price (I paid $[...]), you can't beat this set. I bought the Samsung BDP2500 Blu-Ray & HT-AS720ST Receiver/Theater system to complement the TV.

In reading all the differences about the 120hz vs the 60hz I came to a personal conclusion that 60hz was for me. I read a lot of reviews from people who had bought this set. As usual some loved it and some hated it. Some people can see \"blur\" because it is not a 120hz set. Some folks said that the sound was awful. First of all the human eye can see more \"blurring\" of motion than you will ever notice on a TV. Secondly the sound is fine and can be changed to produce a very dynamic SRS sound. Furthermore if you can drop this kind of cash on a TV then you might just be able to get a good receiver and some nice speakers.Video game play back on this set is nothing short of phenomenal. The ps3, xbox, and wii look amazing on this thing. If you hook stuff up to this via HDMI cables you can change the \"black\" to darker if you need to which I have not bothered with, suits my taste right out of the box.Standard vs. High def. This set was made for high transmissions, but it has an option to smooth out analog broadcasts. Analog broadcasts on a TV this size and with the capabilities of 1080p are always going to look a little pix elated period. After June everything we see on TV should finally be all digital and no longer a problem. But guess what if you are watching some old movies or old TV shows it isn't going to help much because they were recorded using older tech. Some of them will always look like junkie youtube video taken with a cheap digital camera.People reviewing this TV have knocked it down pretty good for a lot of the wrong reasons, shipping problems, warranty issues etc. I hope to clear this up. Most of the bad reviews I read consisted of these problems and had nothing to do with the actual TV itself. Someone couldn't find the three HDMI ports and said it only had one. It does have Three. Amazon will take care of your problems. They offer very good communication.Blu ray and 1080p viewing. This was created for this. Dark darks white whites amazing contrast. Watching 1080i on an HD broadcast like HBO and other movie channels is great. A blu ray movie is even better. And pay per view in 1080p is just like a blu ray.I sincerely hope this review helps to dispel some of the negative and offers some positive for the average joe like me shopping for a new TV.", "Date": "February 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Love my HDTV!", "Author": "TC", "ReviewID": "R1T1ETM3A5GEGI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my tv for about two months, and I am so happy with it.

This was my first major purchase online and I was more than a little nervous, but after all is said and done, I have been thoroughly satisfied. Lets start with the price, so far after shopping all of the major box stores, and even during Black Friday, this is the best price by about $200, and with free delivery. Next the set arrived about five days earlier than quoted, I received an e-mail on a Friday night with a phone number to schedule delivery, of course I assumed that I would be setting up a delivery for the next week, I called on Saturday morning, was told that the earliest it could be delivered was the next morning (Sunday), so I scheduled it and was thoroughly pleased the white glove service was everything promised. They placed the set where I said, verified it worked and that the remote worked and left, very friendly, professional and quick, they would have removed all of the packaging, but I wanted to hold onto the box just in case I had to ship it back. So far so good, once I figured out how to hook all of the cables together, it is by far the nicest, highest quality set I have ever owned.

It's a very good tv that has plenty of color. The darks could be darker but very good and better than most tvs I have seen. Definetly better than the Samsung 46\" DLP I had before this. I spend most of my time watching football and playing xbox 360 and wow, the picture is very very good. The screen puts off some heat, but it's not like you will feel it from over a foot away. It's perfectly normal. It could use more connections for left/right and video connects. (your typical, red, white, yellow connections) But most people use HDMI now days anyways and it has enough of those. Some complain about the speakers, and i can't. I use a 5.1 receiver and some bookshelves so I can't knock the speakers. I even like the remote, very easy to use and i like the fact i can push the light button and see every button on the remote.

Not really interested in this TV for SD viewing though. Still haven't found a perfect color setup but what I have it set to currently is fair enough for watching.The set looks a little boring compared to the higher priced versions, which I like, but I don't want to pay for the bezel to look nice... There's a high gloss to the plastic bezel around the set that makes a reflection that does kind of get annoying when you notice it, but if you don't actively seek it out, it's not a big deal.Worst thing about the set is the speakers, they are so bad that I won't even use them. I've messed around with the EQ enough to decide there's nothing that is going to save the sound on this TV. Recent power outages have killed the front speakers output on my receiver forcing me to use the speakers.

I did not like the black level, viewing angle, and VGA input not supporting 1920x1080 on the Sharp, so I decided to buy the Samsung.Since I've never really used any other LCD TV's (other than an older 32\" no name brand LCD), I'll compare this Samsung with the Sharp.Appearance: Honestly, Sharp TV looked little better to me with thinner bezel and slimer profile.  When I place the Samsung on the TV stand, I immediately noticed the thicker bezel which was not a plus for an overall appearance. This does not mean Samsung does not look good, but simply the transition from Sharp to Samsung did not impress me in terms of the look of the TV.Picture Quality: Black level and viewing angel are noticably better on this Samsung. HD satellite channles looks very good.  I do not have a 1080P source, so I did not experience the highest possible picture quality. HD channels on Sharp TV's looked great also.Audio: Even with some adjustment, the back-firing internal speakers do not sound as good as most of other LCD TV's out there. I think Samsung made a mistake on this and hope they change the location of the speakers in the next version.  I do use 5.1 channel sound system for movies and other stuff, but it's just not convenient and efficient to use the sound system for everything.User Interface: I like the Sharp's user interface better than Samsung. Again, it's the personal preference. Also, somehow reception range for the TV remote is very limited for the Samsung and I'm not sure if this is normal.Overall, I'm happy with the Samsung and wish they had better speakers (or location) and easier user interface. I also paid only $1,421 (Original purchase price of $1,479 less refund of $58 from Amazon price protection) I would choose Samsung over Sharp if I need to buy again.

The TV shows great blacks, vibriant collors and the response time (5ms) is perfect, I have not seen the \"blurry effect\" even in sports or action movies.I would highly recommend buying this TV it is a great bang for your buck.", "Date": "May 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Clear, Bright Picture", "Author": "Sheila \"Technology Fan\"", "ReviewID": "R67AJ82NT34CW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have had the TV several days and enjoyed the clear, bright picture.

If I had to do it again, I would buy a 720p 40-42\" model and not a Samsung.  I would also wait a little longer for more HD channels to become available.The picture is excellent.  Compared to the Toshiba 1080p, I noticed that when in HD, this TV is slightly more sharp.  The Toshiba is a base 40\" 1080p compared to this mid line 46\" Samsung.  Conan O'Brien's tie had a complex pattern on it that was perfectly clear on the Samsung but slightly blurred on the Toshiba.  The only con with the picture is that analog cable is unwatchable from anything closer than 10 feet.  The slightest imperfections and blurriness become huge in a screen in this size.  It's like a youtube video but bigger.  Since most people have digital cable or sat and get a digital signal, this is not a problem for most but even digital signals aren't as clear as they would appear in a smaller screen.  This is less the fault of the TV as it is of the screen size.  You need HD signals in a screen in this size because any imperfections get blown up.  Smaller TVs can make do with regular digital signals and still look good.  In addition, there are only a couple of channels which are 1080i or above.  The full 1080p capability of this TV will only be realized on Blueray and a few channels.  I would rather get a 40-42\" 720p now for cheap and buy something else in 3 years when more content is available.  At the smaller screen size you can barely tell the difference anyways.Although the TV has P-in-P, it's almost useless.  You have to go through a number of menus to turn it on and off or change the channel.  There should be a dedicated button for that.Cons:  Sound is an F.  The stock speakers are almost useless.  I can barely make out speech and it sounds like audio is played in a tin cup.  The bottom pointing speakers are a complete fail.  2 store models at the local big box store had the same issue.  Sony and Toshiba have forward pointing speakers that suck too but at least it's usable for everyday watching.  The Samsung's speakers are not usable for everyday watching.  Sometimes you get echoing between L and R for no reason, this appears to be a common problem.  Changing the channel and switching back fixes it but this is not acceptable on a new TV and Samsung's fix doesn't appear to solve it.  This applies to the signal going through the TV.  I don't use this signal since I have the audio go straight to the audio receiver.  You really don't have any other choice since sound is so bad, but if they put speakers and sound on it, they should work, at least at a basic level.If you buy digital cables for this TV, the cheapest cables are fine.  Bits of data are bits, fancy cables don't work better as they did with analog signals.Lastly, they could at least give you a universal learning programmable remote on a $1200+ TV.", "Date": "December 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best 1080p choice for the price - Can't beat it!", "Author": "V.

In a few words to describe the pros and the cons....I love the quality, available connections, etc.  I was not impressed by the sound quality at all.  Mainly because I'm not used to speaker beaming down, from the frame of the TV, rather I'm used to the sound coming directly at me.  Yes people in the reviews say you can hookup external devices to amplifier through say a receiver...but let's be honest..who wants to turn on a receiver when you just want to watch Oprah.  DO you really wanna hear her voice in surround sound??  More than likely not.  But yes, movies, you will take the time to setup a receiver for the optimal sound quality.  I did however get used to the sound quality, so I can no longer complain, only because I've adapted to the sound quality.For $1549, don't think twice, great TV, and will last you.  If you don't want to buy a extended warrenty, be smart...charge it to your AMEX Credit Card, they expand your warrenty for free an additional 2 years from the orginal warrenty.

I finally decided to buy this model from Amazon. The specs looked great. I run a technology company, so I am no stranger to marketing vague features that nobody understands. Regardless, this seemed like a great set, and the reviews by other Amazon customers, which are generally more reliable than reviews from the press, were very strong.Setup was relatively easy, and this being my first HDTV, the picture looked great. Then I turned up the volume. The sound was shockingly bad - like a clock radio really. Like others with this model, I played with settings, but the sound never got substantially better. After some deliberating, I decided to return the TV and buy the smaller LNT4069FX, which was rated #1 by Consumer Reports. I am MUCH happier now.Here are the results:1. Sound - Really a world apart. The 4069 sounds terrific. It's hard to believe the same company designed both these sets. I know many people run their HDTVs through a surround sound system, so sound is not always an important feature.2. Picture - As good, if not better, even without engaging the 120hz chip.3. Setup & Menu - Much better. Easier setup, much easier menu navigation.4. Look - This TV, IMHO, looks a lot better. The 550P looks cheaper.5. Size - I hope this doesn't discredit me completely, by I found the 40\" much easier to look at. I sit about 12' from the TV, and most guides tell you to get 46\" for that distance. But I found 46\" overwhelming, almost like sitting in the first 3 rows at a movie theater.Finally, let me say that Amazon is a great place to buy a HDTV.

Bit the bullet and purchased this TV in 2008.  Let's say it wasn't a cheap set.  My product was defective from the beginning but I did not know it until the warranty was almost expired.I had my DVD player hooked up to the side connectors, worked fine.  I later bought a Samsung DVD player and connected it to the back HDMI port.  When I played a DVD movie the player would disconnect and reconnect after a split second.  Got very annoying when you are watching a movie, I would have to rewind the movie a bit to find out what I missed.  This happened about every 5 to 10 mins. Called Samsung and they sent a repairman out.  He replaced the main board. The issue was not fixed.  I called them back and they sent me firmware to update my TV. The issue still remained, so, I called them again. The warranty expired.  I called, emailed, and contacted them on their website...no response.  Completely ignored me.I complained to the Better Business Bureau, they called me the very next day.  Sent another repairman out and this time they replaced the main board \"again\" and the power source.  The guy was out the door even before the channels were programmed.  Now, I have lines running across the screen and this double image effect which makes things look out of focus.  Repairman returned and did their simple test and told me it was the Cable Company issue.  Funny that I did not have the lines and double image before they replaced the parts.Called the cable company and they came out twice to check the signal and replaced the lines, everything checked out.  I called the company that Samsung sent out and they came over and checked things again.  They blamed it on the cable company again.  I kept explaining to them that I did not have any other issues with my TV except for the back connectors not working right. The guy was adamant that it's not the TV but the cable. Now, the picture quality is so terrible, that watching TV is not enjoyable anymore. Oh, before I forget, I told the guy that I noticed images that are in motion are very blurry.  He said that's normal.  What?!?!  This set was supposed to cut down on that.  Just shook my head. At this time, I knew he would say anything. I asked again about the original issue, he said he didn't have time to check on that because he had 6 more customers after me and mumbled that my TV was fine.  I was livid at this time, so, I called Samsung.  They said they will send another company out to check out my tv.  I am hopeful they will figure out what is wrong and fix my TV.  I just want the picture quality that I had before.I will not buy anything from Samsung ever again.  You are lucky if there is nothing wrong with their product.  But if you do have a problem, don't count on them to send out competent repairmen.  Had them out four times and the original problem is still there and they added diagonal lines and double image to the problem list.

They informed me that they had received the shipping information from Amazon but not the TV itself. I called Amazon, and they told me the TV was handed over to Pilot on March 3rd - the 1st weekday after I placed the order. They called Pilot directly for me, and was told that Pilot would physically search their warehouse for it. So basically Pilot lost the TV for over a week, and frankly it probably would've been a lot longer had I not called. They either recovered it or sent a new one - I was not told either way - but it finally showed up today (the 18th). So it basically took twice as long as estimated.Then today when it finally arrived, I was expecting the delivery guys to bring it in, unpack it and plug it in to make sure it worked before they left, and take away the empty box - all as advertised as the \"white glove service\". White glove service it was not. Only one guy showed up so I had to help unload it from the truck and bring it in - I didn't have a problem helping and the delivery guy was cool so it was all good, but if I had been a pregnant woman on an old guy then I would've been screwed. It also made me concerned from a liability standpoint - If it got damaged during shipping, they could now blame it on me since I handled it during the shipping process. Anyway, we brought it in, I signed the paperwork, and he left. That was it. Didn't even take it out of the box. It even said on the shipping label \"Amazon special - 2 man delivery\". Fortunatly it works fine, which is good because if I had to send it back I would probably have to wait another month to get a replacement.To be honest, it was free shipping, so I'm not going to get that upset about it, and Amazon's customer service was great throughout it all, but I definatly won't be ordering anything else from anywhere that ships through Pilot - incompetant through and through.All-in-all, this was a great deal on what is probably the best mid-priced TV available (ranked #2 on Consumer Reports for this size range, second only to the LN46A650).

They called 2 days before and set up a time they could come to drop it off.  They brought it in, unboxed it, placed it on the table, hooked up the power cord and tested the remote.  They would have also taken away the box if I had wanted them to.So far, so GREAT with this TV.  I had researched for almost a year, so I knew what I wanted, and I got it.  I wont repeat the specs on this unit, but rather describe my experience with it.  Currently, I have it connected, via coaxial cable, to my basic cable service.  Nothing to write home about as far as SD programming goes with this TV.  But, again, that is the lack of quality of signal, not the TV.  The TV simply displays what it receives.  I also have it hooked up to the Samsung BD-P1500 1080p Blu-ray Player I also bought on Amazon (see my review on that unit as well) via an inexpensive HDMI cable.  First blueray we watched was Hancock and it was amazing.  You really get spoiled watching the 1080p blueray and then have to go back to SD for TV watching. Blah.  But we plan to get HD service from DirecTV soon.I have a \"C\" panel, but have no complaints about it.  It looks great to me.  No stuck pixels (that I have found yet, anyway), no dark corners, no banding, etc.  The remote works from at least 20 ft away if directly in front of TV, and works at about 30-40 degrees off center when within 10ft, no complaints there.  Mine came with the 1006.1 firmware, so I don't have any info regarding updating the FW for this TV, although I have read that it's rather easy.  Have viewed jpegs and played mp3s via a thumb/flash drive on the USB port on the side, works great.  We have the couch set back about 12ft from the screen and I think that is about as close as you would want to be with the 46\" model. If you don't have that much room I would recommend the Samsung LN40A550 40-Inch 1080p LCD HDTV.  Another great thing about this model is that there is no reflective cover over the screen so watching the TV during the day is great; no glare or reflections when watching in a bright room.  No complaints about the viewing angle either.  We have a love seat sitting off center to the TV by about 40 degrees or so and there is no color change that I can see (see my set up in the photos I uploaded to Amazon).  There is a slight darkening of the color if you are 80 or more degrees of center, but who really would be sitting that far off to the side!  And there really isn't any more distortion than you would get from a regular CRT TV anyway.One HUGE CAVEAT is the sound quality.  Like most have reported here, the sound, in my opinion, is atrocious.  Out of the box it was horrible; however, a quick calibration at this link made it much more acceptable:[...]I would recommend some sort of speaker system for it though.  You can go the audiophile route and add an expensive surround sound system, or just buy some inexpensive computer speakers like I did.  I would recommend the Logitech Computer Speakers - X240 (google it) that simply hook into the earphone jack on the side.  They improved the sound IMMENSELY, although you do lose the ability to alter the sound equalizer, so make changes to the sound before you hook up the speakers.Summary: Considering what you are getting for your money, I would definitely recommend this LCD HDTV; and get it from Amazon: lowest price, no tax and free shipping!

I do have a much more discerning eye however it does not bother me at all to watch SD programming whereas on the Sony I avoided it at all costs.- Intuitive controls and menusCons:- Mediocre sound quality", "Date": "October 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Review Samsung LN46A550 46 inch LCD TV", "Author": "RC", "ReviewID": "R3N6UG9V7VSW20", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this product after visiting the big box stores as well as doing a bit of research.

Have had the tv for just at a month now and really enjoy it.  The unit was shipped from the Dallas, Tx area and since I live in central Oklahoma..it was rec'd in a short 2 days.I can't really comment on the \"white glove delivery\", as I picked the unit up myself from their Okc rec'g dept in person.  It was going to take another day for them to get it from Okc to Norman (about a 15 min trip) and I had business near their warehouse anyway, so saved myself the day wait.As many have already mentioned, the sound is a bit weak...but it does get alot better with some tinkering with the settings (avs forums are a good source for this kind of info).  As for the picture on HD At&t; cable....wow!!  Just awesome.  Also, my SD digital cable is pretty darn good as well.  I've read a few people complain that SD cable looks \"horrific\"...but in my opinion that's an issue with their service provider, not the unit...as my picture is very very good.PS3 games and Blu Ray look just great and I've experienced no blurring on Call of Duty 4 or on sports.  Maybe I'm just not sensitive to that..but it's certainly not been a problem for me.The remote is pretty nice, with a nice back-light feature for easy use in the dark and the menus are pretty straight forward and easy to use.  Changing the mode, ie...\"movie, game, etc\" was a bit challenging at first, but it's just a matter of remembering the proper sequence of buttons, which is rather easily done after a few times.The amount of adjustability of this unit is really incredible as well.  I've found that the factory settings are pretty darn good for me, but I've improved the picture (to my taste) by tweaking a few things.  For the techno's out there...they'll enjoy the limitless options in this area.All in all, I'm very happy with my purchase from Amazon (got the unit for $1421).  I saved a bunch of $$$ over the local brick and mortar stores, got the unit in quick fashion and it's performed as great as I was hoping it would.

It was in Milwaukee in a couple days, took the Milwaukee shipper 4 or 5 to get it here. We live in a small city, they probably make a run north  once a week, when you are rural, you know this is the set up, so I was fine with the time issue.The delivery truck this shipper used was very well built, the Mercedes of vans....did, indeed have a Mercedes engine, items inside were ALL televisions and all were standing as they should, delivery fellow very cooperative...so, as a Wisconsin customer, all was reassuring.

My whole family loves it.  The myriad of settings the menus offer allow me to configure it to my exacting standards.  The unit is aesthetically pleasing.  The cost was very reasonable.I was concerned when I read some of the reviews lambasting it for having such horrible sound.  I adjusted the levels in the TV's equalizer and it sounds great.  It sounds better than my dad's Sharp Aquos.  If I want an added kick, I just run it through my amp and get the full theater effect.The TV arrived in five days and the white-glove delivery was great!  I tracked its progress along the way.  No problems at all.The only thing I've noticed is that the TV's price on Amazon fluctuates all the time.  I thought it was a good price when I bought it and it dropped within days.  Then I saw it bump up again, then down!  I was unaware of any price drop guarantee.

My stereo receiver has one optical input and one coaxial.  I was hoping to route the audio over HDMI to the TV, and run the TV's optical out into my receiver.  But the TV only passes 2 channel audio from HDMI inputs out to the optical; Dolby Digital (5.1) is not passed out the optical.  So I am forced to get an optical to coaxial converter.  Minor cost and annoyance, but the reviews on these products aren't presently that positive.Note the manual claims if the TV is receiving DTV (over the air) with a 5.1 signal, it will send that out the optical output.

All in all the ordering process was painless.As for the TV itself, wow.  This is my first big screen 1080p TV and it is quite an experience.  The first thing you'll notice is how unobtrusive the bezel is.  Other tv's have huge colored bezels that detract from the viewing experience *cough* Sony *cough*.This set is very bright without the glossy screen.  Out of the box the picture is pretty good but spend 15 minutes looking on AVS Forum and adjust the set and it'll look spectacular.  The black levels are very good for a midrange set and very good compared to the competitors.  Color accuracy is excellent provided you have a good source.  Also, the set does a good job displaying SD material as long as you're not sitting 4 feet away from the set.  I have not had any issues with noise or artifacts that wasn't due to the source material i.e. SD material being upconverted to HD (I'm looking at you TNT!).One of the drawbacks I've heard is the sound quality of the built in speakers.  While it is true the built in speakers are not of the highest quality, adjusting the EQ based on the recommendations from AVS Forum increases the sound quality dramatically.  Or do yourself a favor and get a inexpensive surround sound system like a Onkyo or Yamaha HTIB.I believe this set is the best bang for your buck in terms of performance and features.

The power cord keeps falling out of the back of the TV, so I've taped it in.  I called Amazon and they called Samsung, and they are sending me a new cord.  When I called Samsung myself, their call center is \"out-sourced,\" and I could barely understand the man I spoke with.  He did give a \"local\" number for service, but I got a very rude gal, and she hung up on me, when I asked her WHERE she was located.  I looked up the company name, and they are not even headquarted in my state.  ODD.......NOW, I have a problem with the picture on numerous channels.  I have a moving white line at the top of the picture.  It has to be a problem with this specific TV, as it replaced a Sony Bravia 1080p, with 120hz.  (That was moved into another room.)  It seems to need a \"horizontal adjustment,\" but I cannot find anything in the literature to address this problem.The sound quality IS indeed horrible. The other comments are RIGHT!  I have had to hook up a surround system to this TV.  Why did Samsung design speakers to face downwards?? After the Sony, I feel that I made a big mistake in purchasing this Samsung.  The Sony was perfect, right out of the box.The price has dropped no less than 6 times since I fist placed my order with Amazon for this TV.So....I will give Samsung service a call, and see if I can get this picture problem fixed.  If not, Amazon is getting this back.  (Like most others, I don't have time to play around with a TV with problems.) The more negative reviews that I NOW read about this set (the 46\" 550), the more concerned I become.  I, too, have the \"C\" panel, and I guess that's the worst one to get.3-4-09.  Power cord received in mail WORKED!  Yeah!But........Samsung service no-showed me today.  No-show and no call.  Not happy.  Waited 35 minutes on hold for Amazon customer service, only to be transferred to another dept. that was CLOSED and my call was disconnected.Honestly, I don't have the patience for a brand new TV that doesn't work like a $1200 TV should.  I guess that's why other buyers go to a local store and pay more than Amazon prices.......OKAY, so if this TV goes back, then what do I get to replace it?  Another Sony Bravia?  Maybe......3-10-2009  Technician cleared up the white line in 2 seconds.

I'd had used Amazon for small purchases before; books, clothes, handbags, things of that nature. I had never spent so much in one buy with Amazon and I was concerned about having to deal with such a large item if it needed returning. I'm so glad he convinced me not to worry about that. Here's the thing.. in weighing my options with local competitors not only could they not beat the price, but none of them offered home delivery! So I began to see a very nice benefit of ordering this through Amazon. It was delivered to my house. Two men brought it in put it on my TV stand and even plugged it in! Take that local retailer! Not too mention I didn't have to pay sales tax and when you're looking at a purchase that is around $1000 (that's what it was when i bought it) that's considerable savings. It's been 3 yrs now and this TV is still entertaining us every day. Take it from me, while it might seem scary ordering such a large costly item online without being able to \"check it out\" (hey go look at the TV at the retailer than come home and order it :P ) .. but in the long run this was an AMAZ(ON)ING deal! front door delivery no extra charge and no sales tax!

If you are looking for a great 1080p TV, the Samsung fits the role perfectly.Lightweight, sturdy, excellent picture and durable the Samsung brand is one of the best names for high-def TV viewing. It does have some drawbacks, such as weak speaker quality and so-so repair support, but who really buys a 46\"+ TV and uses the TV speakers. And Samsungs aren't known for their fragileness and poor worksmanship so you won't be repairing much of them.Now, a side note when ordering. I purchaced it from Amazon at a great price, well below competition prices, and had free delivery with the purchance. The problem is Amazon uses a 3rd party shipping company that isn't that great at delieveries. You can easily find many complaints against them and their procedures. I rate Amazon and Samsung as top notch with their products and service, I rate the delivery company poor. 10 days after ordering I hadn't received my TV nor heard from the delivery company so I called them. Seems they never contacted Amazon to get my delivery info, so the TV was just sitting in their warehouse. I had to CALL THEM to get the TV that I had already purchaced delivered. They also didn't set up or unpackage the TV, they sent 1 person, but the TV is very light and I could handle it easily, but a smaller person might not.Overall, a top notch TV bought from a top notch company, delievered by a not-so-good company. Still a great buy. As a last word, do your homework. Make sure to get the current year brand of the TV, and if you want to test drive it, go to your local TV store and check them out, THEN order it online and save quite a bit of money.

HDTV because it finally seemed the right time to take the cutting-edge technology plunge and prices have become reasonable even for top-of-the-line, large-screen sets.Video: Wow. We couldn't be happier. Simply stunning video with eye-popping resolution. We're not big sports fans, so we felt like 120Hz was unnecessary. I don't know about the \"A,B,C\" monitor issues. I haven't even looked to see the origins of my Samsung monitor. It's simply perfect. I'm especially happy with the up-sampling of regular TV shows, since there are still only a few dozen HDTV channels. Other than the obvious aspect-ratio differences, I can hardly tell the difference between HDTV and non-HDTV channels.Audio: The sound was especially poor until I went into the cable-box menu and found that the default sound setting was for a narrow range. I found the Samsung liked a wide range of sound input even better than \"normal\" range. The audio from the TV is adequate for watching news or talk shows.

The only negative is for the Headphone output which I used for a wireless headset, but gave me a lot of noise from my system.  I suspect it comes from the backlite of the set as the noise is the same as from my flourescent circle bulb used in the TV room when it is on.  Guess I will start using a corded headset with an extension.  Now if I can get my 60,000 hours of use I will be one happy camper.

Being brand-loyal to Sony for many years, I first considered buying another Sony HDTV as a replacement, but the fact that the old set had developed serious picture defects after only two years of use swayed me from buying another Sony. After some research - CNET's positive review, Consumer Reports' top-rating, and the generally glowing user reviews on several websites compelled me to choose this model over a comparable Sony TV.I ordered the set on 11/5/08 and received it 3 days later (delivery from Amazon's Nevada facility to the SF Bay Area is usually quite fast). CEVA, the shipping company, called to arrange a 4-hour delivery window and the set arrived in perfect condition in a timely manner. The two CEVA delivery men were courteous and professional. High marks to both Amazon and CEVA for fast, flawless delivery.As noted on other reviews, the LNA550's picture quality is very good. The color reproduction and black level are outstanding - especially for a TV in its price range. I calibrated the set with a calibration DVD which improved the image compared to the Samsung presets. Using HDMI cables, motion blur isn't a major issue when watching HD programs (sports, movies, etc.), but is much more noticeable on standard definition  programs. When motion blur does occur while watching HD, the blurring is minimal and infrequent enough that it detracts little from the viewing experience. Some occasional color banding issues, but like the motion blurring, a minor negative. Bottom line: this TV produces a beautiful picture.As this is a bedroom set, I didn't want an elaborate audio set-up. I connected Harman Kardon's SoundSticks 2.1 speakers to the headphone jack which solved the much-noted, poor sound quality problem. A high-quality 2.1 system is a nice, simple solution for those who want good audio but don't want to spend much money - or effort - for a more elaborate sound system.Considering the price, free shipping, delivery service and product quality, the overall buying experience with Amazon has been very good.Harman Kardon SoundSticks II 2.1 Plug and Play Multimedia Speaker System", "Date": "January 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "excellent TV", "Author": "Horia Vese", "ReviewID": "R36JN0BN4839IO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this TV.

Although I find the picture was too sharp and had too much contrast with the default picture settings.Please reference the Amazon.com \"mikepro\" review of 7-10-2008 of the Samsung HL61A750 61-inch 1080p LED powered DLP HDTV, for end user picture adjustments.I mention I used these settings on the Samsung HL61A750 61-inch TV and the improvement of it's picture was significant.These same settings also seem appropriate for the Samsung LN46A5590.I further need also mention that we use a standard digital satellite DVR signal rather than a HD video signal and a Sony DVP-NC800H up-standard DVD for the video input.  For audio we have 4 ESS Heil air motion transformer speakers* (2)Heil 1b's* front, (1) JBL Pro III center and (2) Heil PS 811's* rear, invented by Dr Oskar Ernst Heil*, with amplification by a Yamaha HTR 6140, for the surround sound.  The result is well beyond anything I have experienced in a movie theater, although I have yet to experience an I MAX theater.We mounted this 46-inch Samsung TV on a 3 glass shelf stand with a verticle pedistal to support the TV, while the ancillary audio and video components are set on the glass shelves.This is a very nice replacement for the 27-inch cathode ray TV in a wooden entertaiment center.  The new TV picture is crisp and the resolution is as good as the accuity of my vision.Overall this new audio video selection has provided a great improvement in making our master bedroom seem larger as well as more contemporary.I believe Samsung has produced another winner with this model TV and I  recommend it without reservation.I again, highly reccomend perusing the review my \"mikepro\" as mentioned and I believe the settings he so generously provides have application with standard digital video broadcasts as well as HD.

Tio", "ReviewID": "R2F3B6P4FVY2RN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll preface this review by saying I purchased this TV as part of the Amazon Customer's Vote promotion as I realize that cost probably plays a role in opinion.  I wasn't really looking for a new TV, but at that price, I couldn't turn down an opportunity to upgrade my 480p EDTV (Panasonic VIERA TH-42PA20U/P).  Overall, I'm extremely satisfied by the LN46A550.  To spare you from repetitive info, I'll just focus on some key things:\"White Glove\" Delivery Service: Ordered 12/1, Arrived Monday 12/8 (CEVA called on 12/4 and said it could be delivered on Saturday 12/5 but I wasn't home to receive it).  I was anxious to get my package so on 12/8 I called inquiring where it was - the shipping company operator is very nice (seems to be the same guy picking up the phone every time I call).  He called the driver and told me they'd be at my home within half an hour and they were!  But don't get me wrong, this was no white glove service - two men dropped it off in the house and left.  I suppose I could have asked them to help set it up, but honestly, they're glorified moving men that probably didn't know jack about TV's anyway.PIP (Picture in Picture): Probably one of the few complaints I have about the TV, but something that stuck out to me almost instantly.  First, this feature can't be accessed via a button on the remote.  You have to dig through a few menu options on the TV to activate it.  Second, there's no option that I know of to watch anything in the PIP/POP window outside of standard def analog cable/antenna.  I think that means I'll need a digital converter box after Feb. 2009 just to use the PIP feature (they should have built in a slot for an optional multi-stream cable card).  Besides not being able to catch 2 HD channels, you can't even switch the inputs so that your PIP works for a device on another input like a DVD player.VESA compatible: uses size M8 screws, although the 4 from my previous TV were too long so I needed to use spacers to make sure we didn't punch through the front of the screenFirmware updates: are really easy -  you just download the software from Samsung's website to a USB thumb drive, unzip the files, plug the USB drive into the WISELINK USB port, and upload through the menu.  However, this can cause changes to picture/audio quality (find better settings online at AVS Forum, CNET, etc.)Matte screen: at first I was put off by it thinking the glossy screen seems to give off the impression that the picture on the TV is sharper.  But, I soon came to appreciate it when I realized I no longer had to draw the blinds to watch TV during certain times of the day.  I don't miss the glossy factor much anymore.That glowing white light... Samsung is generally very impressive with their designs.  This one may be too much though.  They opted to put a white LED light right under the Samsung logo that turns on when the TV turns on (along with a quick little audio melody).  It's fine during the day, but can be VERY distracting in a dark room.  At least there's an option to turn off this feature - or change it so that the light's on when the TV's off and vice versa.A550 vs. A650: I saw both at Best Buy side by side.  I couldn't appreciate the extra value of the 120Hz on the 6 series - especially when it meant higher cost and the reddish tint to the frame (though, that's probably a personal preference).  If you're having trouble deciding, just go to a brick and mortar and decide yourself.  Just be warned that settings inside a brick and mortar are often set to impress and are unrealistic at home.Don't let the TV speakers be a deal breaker - they're not great by any means, but they are comparable for built in TV speakers and suffice.  Quality is probably also hindered by the fact that the speakers face downwards so that they don't become an eye sore on the face of the TV.  However, that being said, do yourself a favor and get yourself a home theater system.  If you spent that much to upgrade picture quality, you might as well bump up the audio to take full advantage of that amazing Blu-ray experience!Despite some of these nuances, don't underestimate the awesomeness of this TV!  It may be lacking some features that come on the higher-end models, but it's probably the best quality you can get for the price, pound for pound - until the 2009 versions comes out anyway.My components: TiVo Series 3 (HDMI), Wii (Component), PS3 (HDMI), PS2 (Component), Onkyo 7.1 receiver (HDMI), DVD player, & speakers.", "Date": "December 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "What a great deal get im while there hot!!", "Author": "Jack D.

It cannot play mpeg videos though from USB.I agree that Remote is not great as some other reviewers are saying. It needs to be pointed right at the center of the TV.

We originally wanted to get a Sony after all the reviews, but a little to pricey for us at this point.  Since I work at Amazon, and have a discount we can use, we started checking out the prices and possibilities there.  We were impressed with the prices and options even without the discount.  After considering the specs on this product and the price with those specs we went with the Samsung, even though we were worried about the reviews we read about Samsung having the biggest issues with screen reflections from windows and lights.  Over the past few months of ownership we have found this TV really has no serious problems with reflections since we have two windows and plenty of light.  The picture is awesome.  I really enjoy the screen size button on the remote so I can quickly adjust to the best screen size with different cable channels and movies.  It has several choices.  I like being able to hook up my laptop computer to it as a monitor so I can watch videos off the internet from Amazon's Video on Demand, Hulu, Netflix, etc. for larger picture and sound to run through our stereo receiver.  We will eventually have a Computer Media Center for the TV to do the same thing.  The remote is easy to use and to understand.  I will agree with others that reviewed this product that the sound directly from the TV is not that great, but they are just TV speakers.  The TV was created I think for a home theater situation, which is what we have.  We have moved to a smaller place and downsized from a Sony 61\" projection big screen TV to this.

The picture is still just as beautiful as ever once the TV warms up but when it's first turned on there is a real BIG problem with the picture. The right side of the screen is dark and wavy. This problem seems to be getting worse and I have researched it and found it with other owners as well. The LCD panel itself seems to be the problem and it would cost too much to repair so now I'm just waiting for the picture to go out completly. It's really a shame because otherwise it's been a beautiful TV. It looks as good as anything current in the stores now. Sorry to have to report this problem. I wonder how many others who bought this on Amazon have had the same problem?", "Date": "September 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great HD television at a nice savings.", "Author": "b.h. \"chicago detroiter\"", "ReviewID": "R2IQ12EPQNR4A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased this tv about 3 months ago and so far its been great.

It made going HD very easy.  It is exactly as specified on the Amazon site. Great picture without much adjusting.  In fact this TV seems to be able to handle a wide variety of signal types (HD, SD, antenna, satellite, video tape, DVD, etc.) and adjust to give the best picture. Also handles fast action without much blur.  Connections are simple and straightforward. There is one button on the remote to switch between 16:9 and 4:3, and if you are watching a 4:3 program, the same button lets you easily choose whether to have side bars or zoom in and lose a horizontal strip.  Some things about the remote are not intuitive, so use the manual.  The stand is stable and sturdy and swivels the screen easily.  The beveled edges are shiny, but not as reflectively glossy as some TVs.  The shipping and setup were as advertised, but you should know that it takes significantly longer than Amazon's usual speedy delivery. The shipping company let mine sit for a few days before finally bringing it out.

I also like the design of this one better. I personally don't like the Touch of Color of the other one. The only thing that this one doesn't have that the other one does is the 120 Hz  feature, which I would like to have. But for the price of the LN46A550 I think that you get a whole lot of TV.2013 UPDATE - After having the TV for almost a year some lines appeared on the screen. Samsung customer service was great and they replaced it with a newer model, which I've had for about three years now and no complaints.

The sound can also be tweaked to be acceptable (again AVS forum has settings posted).I don't think the 650 and 750 series are worth the additional money compared to this 550.  You would pay a few hundred dollars more for (1) a more reflective screen, which is what I want to avoid, otherwise I would go for plasma for better picture, (2) slightly better contrast, for which the difference is probably mostly on paper, (3) 120Hz, which I haven't yet seen its advantage over the 5ms response time of this TV, (4) better speakers, which you can easily beat with even low-end external speaker systems.My TV was hit on the top right back corner probably during packaging at the factory.  It dented the bezel by half an inch and cracked the back cover a little.  All these cannot be seen from the front.  Amazon agreed to either replace the TV with no additional cost or refund 20%.

It doesn't work very well.  It worked marginally for the first week, and now it only finds an Anynet+ receiver, where as before it would find an Anynet+ Theater.

The delivery service called me on Tuesday to schedule delivery. They came during their window time yesterday, wearing their white gloves, and unboxed the TV very carefully in my house. The box was 100% damage free as well. They proceeded to set the TV on my stand, plug it in, hook it up to my HDMI cables I had ready for it, and made sure the picture and sound was functional.3rd thumbs up...TV is amazing. 30,000:1 contrast ratio has some seriously accurate black levels. I tinkered with the settings for a few hours to get all my inputs just how I like them. I even setup \"night\" modes to knock down the retina piercing brightness that this TV is capable of. Even in full sunlight I only have the backlight on 70% and the brightness at 50%. 46\" is bigger than I really thought it would be, but it's not annoyingly large. Makes reading text very easy. 1080p is a great step up from 1080i when it comes to games, internet browsing, image viewing, etc. I can't really say it's THAT much different during movie play, but hey ok. This LCD is very very fast. I see no ghosting AT ALL in games, sports, video, etc.last thumbs up...having this TV really cleaned up my entertainment center's cable mess. Well, that paired with the PS3 did. Gone is my old progressive scan DVD player from 2003. Gone is my DLink Media Center from 2005. Gone is my PS2. The PS3 serves the purpose of multiple devices which, although I originally was apprehensive about, I decided I actually like. It's a much better media player (mostly due to native h264 and high-def support). It's a way faster blu-ray loader than the standalone I had. I was able to get rid of 4 sets of component cables, a handful of analog audio cables, some optical cables, etc. A few HDMIs, one component set (for the Wii) and a few opticals take the place of everything.

It has 1080p which many people feel is a must have on most new tv's but for the price it has an astonishing 30,000/1 contrast ratio. I guarantee that on any similarly priced tv you would be lucky to find a ratio above 10,000. Calibrated properly this tv will look more like a $2k tv. It delivers the blacks, colors and contrasts that make it a to competing tv.For those of you who don't plan on getting hd service then don't bother with this tv, because you standard def channels will just look so so.  They looked better than I thought they would, but my old tube tv was far better. I was surprised how it made my Wii games look a lot sharper and vivid. Honestly to get the most out of this tv you should have a blu ray, ps3 or xbox360 to utilize the 1080p. If you don't plan on using any of these then you might want to look at a 720p hdtv. You can save some big bucks. Broadcast tv won't be switching to 1080p anytime soon since they don't have nearly enough bandwidth to broadcast all channels in hd. This tv will probably be outdated by the time that day comes. This tv will have all the hook ups and extras that you could need on a tv in this price range. I was extremely impressed with the anti-glare screen. I have my tv in a fairly bright room and it is very rare that I have a reflection on the screen. The matte finish really helps with the glare issue.As for my experience in purchasing through Amazon, the tv was in stock when I ordered it, but it wasn't shipped for a full week. From what I have heard that's a fairly long time to ship something, especially considering the tracking info said that it was ready to ship the day after I ordered it.Once it was shipped using CEVA it took less than four days to have it delivered to my door. Of course I was worried like most people about damage or \"what if I have to return it?\" To my relief it was in perfect condition and all I had to do was plug in my cable box. The white glove service did everything else. He even offered to carry my 100 lb. 36\" tube tv off the stand. Luckily I had friends coming that night so I had them just leave the new tv on the floor.Great experience. No different than if you were to have it delivered by a big box store. For everyone worried about damage when ordering through Amazon remember, they have a great return policy. Also, whether you buy your tv from a big box store or Amazon, all tv's are transported the same way. You are just as likely to get a damaged tv from a big box store as you are amazon. Might as well save some money on the lower price tag and lack of tax.So far I have had Amazon adjust the price of the tv twice.

Comparing the performance of the Samsung LN series against sony XBR4 in the big box stores,  I was convinced that Samsung was more bang for the buck.  The 5msec response time makes a lot of difference when watching fast moving scenes.  The 30,000 contrast produces absolute blacks and whites.  Easy to use remote with almost all menus accessible in less than 2 button operations. LN650 has shiny screen ( which brings out the contrast and image quality a tad better) , 50,000 contrast and 120KHz AMP. But for the extra $500 I was not convinced  on the picture quality. Only bad thing about 550 is the speakers and the fact that it has only 1 antenna (RF)  input  compared to the LNT4665.  So you  cannot have OTA and cable at the same time.  Still trying to figure out whether I an do it.  I have turned the speakers off and am using my home theater.  It has digital audio output which is a plus.Auto tuning -  requires a lot of patience.  IT takes about 20-30 minutes to tune and then remove the scrambled channels .  I guess that is the same with other TVs as well.  cable tuning gives options for analog and digital ( std, irc , hrc ). I tried all of them ,  std works fine.  sometimes hrc, irc seem to pick up a few additional channels and drop some.  You can use only 1 of the options since tuning them to the other will drop the previously memorized channels.  It did pick up a few analog OTA channels. But did not get any DTV air.  Most likely I need an antenna. But how do I plug it into the TV. A switch??  But that is a pain.OVerall  - fantastic TV .

TV arrived quicker than expected and guys who delivered placed it where I wanted and waited until I tried a DVD.

I tried blu-ray. Its definitely better than DVD picture but not better enough to force me to make a purchase. considering that huge number of regular DVD media around, this is great.- i love the wiselink feature which allows me to copy pics to usb drive and display them as slide show on TV with background music. a great background for party's. I can finally see the value of my 8M digital camera..5x7 prints dont do justice to 8M camera'sWhat I didnt like:- no many things but audio could be better.- i am still trying to get my hands around the 4:3 vs 16:9 aspect ration. Somehow, I don't always like 16:9 format. But this TV has a feature to zoom vertical portion slightly (zoom1) and seem's more to my liking.Here are couple of related items:- i bought my cables at monoprice.com. good price/quality.- amazon's 30day price match is great. when TV dropped $75 in a week, they made prompt adjustment.

After a failed attempt at a larger Philips model (screen went out within 30 days) I tried Samsung because on every sales floor the Samsung models just looked crisper. I chose this one in particular because the user reviews were so strong. At first I loved it. This was my first flat screen TV so I had nothing to compare it to other than friends or family members who already had nice big flat screens. For a long time I thought this one was the envy of all of theirs. Playing movies from my PS3 looked phenomenal. Watching sports, however, was a different story entirely. I soon learned about a little thing called refresh rate. Over time I realized that while movie watching off my blu ray/ps3 was fantastic watching any sporting event was less than fantastic. Lots of blurring going on (especially watching basketball). Football wasnt so bad and Hockey was ok (but who watches hockey on tv?). I eventually came to terms with this reality and learned to live with it as many features of this tv held up great. But then.....One day I turn on my set and I notice a weird fuzzy line on the right side of the handset. The line fit exactly where the 3:4 aspect ratio would be (black bars on sides). Watching anything in HD or 16:9 there was this line of green and blue blurring. Just shy of 2 full years owning this set and there it is. I call around for a quote to fix and to my surprise I get the following repsonse: \"you're better off buying a new TV, man. That's a panel issue and those babies run about [...] plus with labor.\" That's almost as much as I bought the TV for!!!! Needless to say I am disappointed. That is until I realize I bought with my AMEX card in full and they honor 1 year extended warranties on purchases made in full. THANK GOD! Had I not paid in full with my AMEX Id be out almost [...] (how much I paid for it back in 2008).  In short, this is not cool that a LCD set with such great reviews can bug out in less than 2 years! And we are not talking about something cheaply and easily repaired. Very troubling.PROS: lightweight, easy to set up. Great for 1080 movie watching. Swivel top to angle where you want it.CONS: sound is bad, like very very bad (you have to hook it up to some type of sound system), Sport watching produces a lot of blurring, sometimes it doesn't turn off properly (but this could be a bi-product of my DVR remote I use for it).

The color/tone was perfect straight out of the box for me.  It is also extremely quiet and doesnt give off any heat (I have it in a very small room and the temperature in there and the rest of the house is the same).  I also really like the matte finish of the screen.  This tv sits directly across the room from a window where the glare was tterrible with a normal tv but it is significantly reduced with this one.  That is one way this tv is actually better than the A650, which has a glossy reflective screen.I use it for over-the-air HD tv which looks great (if you have a strong signal on your antenna) and blu-ray movies, but the thing i use it for most is my Playstation 3.  These two were made for eachother!  The games look stunning even though most of them are only 720p. This TV doesnt have the 120Hz refresh rate like the A650 (which Ive seen because my parents have the A650).  The 120hz refresh rate is nice for nature programs, animated movies, and sports but I actually do not like it for live action movies and tv shows.  I feel like it looks like you're on the film set, which sounds good, but it really makes it look fake to me for some reason. Videogames currently only output at 60Hz so the 120Hz refresh rate makes no difference for them.Overall I am extremely happy with this TV and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a nice HDtv, especially if your budget is a little tight.", "Date": "January 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "great lcd!", "Author": "Aaron M.

Set up was easy and we tweaked sound and picture via suggestions from the AVS forum which I recommend checking out. It played great until tonight, 12/7. We noticed a fixed red pixel on the right center of the screen. We called Samsung ASAP and were advised it's a dead or stuck pixel. They indicated they don't replace the panels for a few bad pixels let alone one even if it annoyed us looking at it. It has to be a larger failure. Fortunately we were in the return/exchange period at Circuit City where we bought it.  (we bought it locally instead of Amazon because they me the price at 1299 and we wanted a local rep if anything went wrong plus Amazon stopped the price guaranty if the price dropped after you bought it- Note to Amazon, bad idea to drop that).  Samsungs rarely get retuned if you read the internet reviews and discussions so I assume we just got a \"bad\" set given it was two weeks old.  Also, there is some discussion the web of the A, C or S panels being used by Samsung. I called them and they advised there is no difference.  I noticed Best Buy and Circuit City had display models which when I looked on back were S panels. I got a C panel from Mexico. We went to exchange the set tonight but Circuit City was out, Best Buy was off sale etc so we decided with the manager's suggestion and more internet research to get a roughly equivalent Sony 46v4100 Bravia.  It has the same basic contrast, 4 HDMI inputs including side inputs etc. It was our alternative choice originally but was not on sale as much.  We just got it home and it sent up quickly. It's a little heavier than the Samsung, 58 lbs instead of 51 but otherwise comparable. Also we wanted a matted screen since it's in a bright room and the SONY did not have a lot of glare in the store when we tried it. This could just be our experience but we were disappointed this Samsung failed so fast and that if we were outside the exchange period Samsung would not have done anything about one or a few bad pixels. As a consumer, a fixed red pixel in the middle of a screen is a problem when it's a two week old set. Kudos to Circuit City for great customer service in the original sale (best buy refused to meet the price on sale at the time) and for the exchange/return and switch to the Bravia which they discounted to basically the Samsung on sale price.", "Date": "December 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "Poor sound quality.", "Author": "Martin Wesley Holeman", "ReviewID": "R1M3TIO58HM4S6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This model has good picture quality but the audio is poor.

You cannot buy another brand LCD TV with 30,000 to 1 contrast ratio, at 5ms response time, 1080p resolution, 3HDMI ports, at the price Amazons is asking. What you get are less features, and you can see the difference in the picture quality. They give you 30 days if the price goes down they take it off your credit card. I saved another $ 150. The picture is so clear and crisp it is like looking at real life colors. The sound is good but it sounds better with a few more speakers. If I needed another TV I would buy this same one agan.

The audio seems to be fine for me, however when I throw in a DVD or watch a premium channel the picture is amazing, but for the audio I turn on and up my Sony 5.1 surround sound amp and it is just like I have my own personal theater in home. For those that are unhappy with the audio, get a surround sound system, that will improve the audio greatly. The Picture is best watching in Tru-HD broadcast. I do stretch the picture when those channels come in 4:3, to prevent Burn in, they say LCD's are not likely to have that happen, but I have read for the first few hundred hours to do this can't hurt. LCD screens do take a little getting use to, my old HD-TV was awesome too, Thanks to Comcast lack of listening to me, when I called to say my cable kept freezing up, it created Burn in on my Panasonic HD TV, it damaged the tube, they did correct by buying me this Samsung, I miss my old TV. Overall, The Samsung has a ok audio,recommend using 5.1 surround sound with Samsung TV, the picture is Great once you get use to looking at it, the screen has anti glare which is great and is viewable from sides too.

But alas, this set simply didn't cut it for games. Everything looked GREAT on close up shots or still shots, but the second the action started or wider panned camera angles were used, the picture got really really grainy and blurry. Even my wife - definitely not snob on things like pixel resolution - walked in and noticed how lousy the game looked. Strangely it was particularly noticeable in game played on artificial/field turf (I'm no expert, but I'm guessing that material reflects more light and thus creates more detail for the pixels, whereas natural grass is more matte). I called DishNetwork to see if my signal was week, but was told everything was a-okay. Oh, and basketball also looked grainy too.So, I exchanged it. I'm still looking for the replacement, but I'm probably going to go with a Plasma set. 120hz might help too, but I'm told that Plasma is the way to go for sports fans.Other than that...Pros:- Great picture in less action oriented shots. We rented Dark Knight one evening on Video on Demand, and it really did look amazing in 1080. Wow.- Amazon \"white glove\" was amazing. I had my doubts about buying a TV online, and they were great. Excellent service.- Actually, I give BIG kudos to Amazon for being completely cool about my decision to return the TV. I made the call, and they sent somebody to my house within 48 hours. They boxed it up and took it away with no hassle. No restock fee, no questions. Very impressive. That earned my loyalty in a big way.- The menu on this set is very well done, as is the TV form factor.- Good remote.Cons- The serious blur/pixelation problems on sports that I outlined above.- I personally would give this set relatively poor scores on black colors.- The speakers were okay, but not great.- The picture in standard def is pretty lousy.

Your eyes won't lie to you when it comes to tv viewing. I use to tell people find one that catches your eye best.,go home reserch or ask me it's service record and features and if you like what you see, buy it. Sales people can tell you a hundred different facts about it's technical prowess,but the bottom line is do you truly like the picture. After all, it will be in your home for years,and it's your hard earned money. I can tell you, you will be hard pressed to find a better lcd tv or a better price than this one offered thru Amazon.com,I couldn't find one better, so needless to say I bought it. And with the money we saved, bought a hd dvd/vcr recorder to boot! I viewed 4millionths of a second and 5mil. refresh rates on these units and it's not noticible to the human eye,your brain can't detect variation at that speed anyway,so lets be real. You either like the picture or you don't, so go figure. Folks you can't go wrong on this deal, so go out to best buy, circuit city, ultimate electronics and see for yourselves. Don't bother checking thier prices because it's not even close to the deal Amazon offers,but by all means look! it will make you feel great when your friends overpayed by hundreds of dollars for not doing thier homework. something to boast about come superbowl sunday!

For you techies out there - I have a HD DVR box connected via HDMI and was testing the set on 1080i broadcasts.  I was getting a great picture on my Westinghouse with the same exact setup.  I also tried a different HDMI cable to see if I got any difference - to no avail.  ALSO - I returned the tv thinking it was a dud, and got a replacement.  The picture looks exactly the same.
