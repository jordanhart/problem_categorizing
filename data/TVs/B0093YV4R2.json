It suffers from some typical LED issues, but not bad enough for me to return it.  There is some backlight bleed-through at the corners of the TV, which is noticeable during dark scenes.  It's not bad enough to bother me though.  This is a bedroom TV for me and I do not game on it so I can't comment on gaming lag.  I assume it is pretty bad with a 60Hz refresh rate.  Although, I haven't noticed any serious lag watching sporting events.  Out of the box, the video settings aren't terrible, although I definitely recommend making a couple changes if you don't plan to do a proper calibration.  I wound up turning all the \"features\" off in the advanced video menu, turning the sharpness completely off, and setting the color temp to standard.  One other thing I'll mention is that HDMI from a FiOS Motorola STB is not working (tested 3 different HDMI cables).  I had to connect using component.  I should also mention that I had the same issue with my previous TV - a Panasonic plasma.  So I am starting to think the weak link is the STB.  The component feed looks great though, so other than having 5 cables instead of 1, there's no issue here.  I got this TV on special on Amazon for just over three hundred bucks.  If it hits that price again, jump on it.  It's worth it in my opinion.", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great T.V. for a GREAT price!", "Author": "EMC", "ReviewID": "R27SFHUNDQLI89", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this tv back in February, but didn't receive it until March, as I do not live in the US. Anyhow, I hooked it up as I received it, and I turned it on and I was instantly in love with it!!! It's no VIZIO or Sharp or Samsung, etc., but it was in my budget range and I was absolutely thrilled about it!! Got it on sale for $350 + tax. I was a bit skeptical at first because of the contrast ratio and the low output from the speakers, but it was pretty much the best tv I could find and afford that was in my price range. I have NO REGRETS whatsoever about purchasing this tv!!!I hooked it up to my desktop via HDMI and ran some music videos and movies both in 720p & 1080p and I was just blown away! Stunning graphics!! I was surprised at the performance, given the fact that the contrast ratio is only 4000:1 and that the refresh rate is only 60Hz. Just a few pros and cons about it, but other than that, it's a wonderful television.Pros: Thin, not bulky like some older flat screens  Great picture quality  42\" LED screen  Sturdy glass table stand with rubber gripsCons: 8W speakers don't deliver good bass (easily fixed with home theater system)  60Hz refresh rate  4000:1 contrast ratio  Only 2 HDMI ports  No VGA input for computers (only matters if you don't have HDMI port on computer)  USB port only plays music or shows picturesWell, that's pretty much it.

I'd considered plasma, but wanted something a bit lighter weight for a wall mount.  I knew I'd be mounting it myself, and that I wanted a dynamic mount with a swing-neck, rather than a more fixed angle.  The TV arrived sooner than expected.  The deliverer carried the TV on one arm.I easily carried it upstairs and began the installation process.  Super easy.  Nice lightweight object.I can see some of the concerns of other buyers that discussed the inherent shortcomings of LED/LCDs.  When I have a flat black image on screen, I can see that it is not really a flat black.  On a plasma, it is truly flat.  But that happens so infrequently... it doesn't really bother me.  The picture is stunning when showing moving images. When I have a true HD signal (Over the Air via my Tivo premiere) I just can't stop staring at it.  When the TV processes a standard def signal, it looks slightly worse than that signal did on the tube TV this one replaced.The audio is reasonable. Better than any other TV I've owned.With only 2 HDMI inputs I guess I might need to do some cable switching, but it hasn't been an issue so far.  I only have a DVD player and TIVO hooked up currently.I could see where some owners might be lonesome for onboard wifi and apps. I don't, because my Tivo makes up the shortomings.This TV is everything I could have asked for at a $349 price point.  I see it has increased to $399 since my purchase. I'm kicking myself a bit for not buying a second one at the lower price-point.  But if the main room TV dies tomorrow, I'd likely replace it with another like this one, even at the $399 price.*****UPDATE*****I'm knocking it down to 4 stars due to no PC/VGA input.  This is not a crisis item, but it was expected, given that I reviewed the RCA user manual before purchase.  Also, a VGA input is listed on the technical details.

It played well until I changed channels or when a channel was not on an HD channel. We noticed a shadow on the bottom, right and left side of the screen. The shadow (kind of egg shell color) looked a bit like a 'burn-in' (like when a monitor has been left on and you can still see an image when it was off). The shadow on this unit was not noticeable when the unit was off. The shadow was especially noticeable when the screen or picture was on dark or black areas of the picture. The sticker says the unit was manufactured December 2012, and I purchased it January 25, 2013. Maybe I got one out of thousand that RCA had built that was not one of their best units. There are other good reviews, but I'm not one of the good reviewers of this particular unit. The Amazon associate was helpful with the return of this item. I plan to purchase another TV from Amazon, just not another RCA unit.Update, February 18, 2013:Since writing reviews on the RCA 42 and 46 inch TV's I have been in contact with Amazon and a RCA tech representatives. I'm not sure I understand the \"backlight\" that is seen, but I will add a link to what may assist in what I consider an ignoring view. The Amazon tech had not experience what I described to him, and the RCA tech had no clue but did agree to send out a tech (which I'll probably cancel later). From speaking with the techs, I have concluded that the new LED TV's, at least an RCA, is this is the \"new normal\" now. The shadow 'may be' the backlight that is seen on the screen and this should not affect the actual picture quality. However, new normal or not is ignoring to me.

When this one went on special, I quickly reviewed the specs, reviews, etc. and decided to give it a try. I mean, why not since it was the same price as the 32\" tvs! I was surprised at just how much bigger a 42\" is compared to a 32\". We got it right before the super bowl and WOW!!! It made the game come alive!Pros:Sound quality it GREAT! You don't need an external speaker system as in some reviews on other tvs.Settings are easy to use. We found that the high definition is the best quality all around. You can also change the screen size. We have it on full screen and quality is still there.Picture quality is fantastic if you are on HD stations. Crisp and clear. Also with DVDs.2 HDMI slots plus regular video cable outputs means you don't have to go back and forth if you want to stream straight from your computer. Very easy to do; just plug in the HDMI cable, change the setting input to AV and you are set!Easy input change. It's right on the remote and is very simple to change from HDMI 1& HDMI 2, AV (for DVDs, Roku, etc.), Video (never used it yet), and Media (for thumb drive for pictures, etc.)Very slick modern look and very thin. Looks and feels quality.Very easy to put together. Just have to put in a few screws in the base and you are good to go. Very well packaged.Cons:The picture quality isn't quite as good on regular cable channels and Roku stations, but compared to my old box tv, it is very comparable. You just see the difference on the HD channels. Not enough of a difference to down rate this product.Not wireless but with 2 HDMI inputs, that is not a problem for me.I'm VERY happy that we waited and got this tv!!!!
