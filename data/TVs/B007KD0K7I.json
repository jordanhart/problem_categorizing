RUN Do Not Walk from this TV.", "Author": "hardhead", "ReviewID": "R3UQJKNOIS7NQD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought new at Wal-Mart, after only 6 mths just shut down and would not do anything, according to their TV repair person this is an ongoing problem with this TV.  Part to fix is on back order, have been waiting for 3 weeks, I'll bet they are putting the same part that is on back order in new TVs by the thousands.  Customer service is worthless, they say one thing when you call and then say they said something else when you call back.  We are stuck watching the small tv from the bedroom.  My Husband is not happy, I am not happy and Panasonic does not care.", "Date": "March 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "TV Type: Plasma\nScreen Size Class: 50\"\nVertical Resolution: 720p\nMaximum Resolution: 1024 x 768\nScreen Refresh Rate: 600Hz", "Name": "Panasonic Consumer 50\"Plasma HDTV,720p,2-HDMI,2-USB,1-Component,1-Composite,600Hz.Sub-Field LCD TV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51j-IoEb%2B1L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007KD0K7I"}}
