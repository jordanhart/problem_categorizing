{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Smart 3D TV from LG!", "Author": "S. Raman \"Sankar\"", "ReviewID": "RQ6SOOB726XV6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm very happy with 47LA6900 TV!  I'm replacing my 47LM6200 with this TV and would like to give a brief review to help others decide.New Features:This TV has Dual Core processor and I can see the difference immediately.  The moment you press menu or home, it hardly takes a second to launch (The previous gen single core processor takes a good 2 or more seconds).  The Magic remote is shorter/sleeker and easier to handle.  I like the new voice search.  Along with internet, it also searches and lists the files in DLNA shares.  This TV also has in-built 2.1 sound.Appearance:The Cinema Screen looks stunning and one of the best looking TV sets out there now.  With the LA series, they have re-designed the stands.  It is wider than last year's LM series and more stable on the surface.  The build quality is excellent and a lot better than last year models.  The LG Logo is LED lit and lights once when turning on.  It remains off while watching TV.  You have the option to leave them ON in the menu.Picture Quality:Out of the box with little tweaking, the picture quality is excellent.  IMHO, it is better than last gen TVs.  There is no flash lighting with this TV.  This is my second 47LA6900, the first one was damaged and returned.  Even the damaged one had no flash lighting issues.  So I'm guessing that LG has done something to avoid this.  The passive 3D is excellent as usual and I didn't find any ghosting/clouding issues.  Overall, this TV has great picture quality.Sound:This TV has in-built 2.1 sound and sounds much better than LM6200.  The sound quality is excellent (IMHO) for the TV speakers.User Interface:The UI looks much similar to previous gen TV except for few changes along with voice search options.  Now you can rent 3D movies from 3D World.TV Packing & Handling:The biggest minus is the way this TV is packaged.  There is a good possibility that you could receive a damaged unit, especially on the top.  So buy it from reputed dealer with good return policy.  The first TV I received had a dent on top left which also damaged the screen.  Thanks to Amazon for sending the replacement with 1 day shipping.  The second one had a very small scratch on the exact same place, but it didn't have any impact on the screen.  The top safety padding inside the TV box was broken on both TVs and luckily for me the second one didn't have any major impact.  I'm not sure if this is because of poor packing by LG or poor handling by UPS.Cons:There isn't anything big to list here other than packing.  Just listing few minor glitches.--Packing--The OS is little buggy.  When clicking some options (eg. LG TV Mall) the screen goes black and you have to turn off and on the TV to operate normally.  When you try to install any apps (eg. Registration app) make sure you are logged in before installing.  The TV doesn't respond for 7 to 10 seconds and doesn't show any message that you need to log in.  LG is usually quick in releasing Firmware's and hope this should be taken care.Other thoughts:Initially I was planning to buy 47LA6200 (even ordered here).  It was $300 lesser and doesn't have Cinema Screen, 2.1 sound, LED+ with Local dimming and magic remote.  The magic remote and 2.1 sound features made me choose this TV and I'm 100% happy with my purchase.", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "INCREDIBLE PICTURE, SOMEWHAT WONKY OS", "Author": "A. Davis", "ReviewID": "ROTEDM7AIWVY9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "***Update 8-23-13 Just got the Amazon Instant Video app, and it works well.***I previously had a very nice 42-inch plasma TV. It was 720p, no internet connection or apps, just a nice basic TV. When this 55-inch 1080p, 3D, SmartTV became available, I jumped at it. There are pros and cons, but overall, I like it a lot for what I normally do with a TV, which is... well... watch TV.The picture is amazing. I mean jaw-droppingly awesome. I feel like I'm in the same room as the people I'm seeing on the screen. This technology is incredible, and the sound is quite good. I couldn't move from the couch for the first day I had the TV. I played a Blu-Ray DVD, and the visuals were stunning. The TV was very easy to set up, and most of the controls were fairly intuitive. I didn't have to consult the manual for most things. I quickly learned that I shake the \"magic remote\" to make the arrow cursor appear so I can use the \"smart\" features. (My cat loves that moving arrow cursor.) The remote has a nice feature where you hit the \"back\" button to go back to the regular TV input.  I have checked out some of the apps, and I'm sure I'll identify a favorite video streaming service and use this feature. I played a couple of samples, and they played beautifully. I also sampled a couple of 3D videos, which were a little freaky, but I guess you have to get used to that.As another reviewer has noted, there is no Amazon app on this TV. I like Amazon Instant Videos and was looking forward to watching them on my big fabulous new TV.  You can go through the Internet on the TV to get to the Amazon.com site and find your videos, but mine would not play. I tried the same thing with the internet version of another streaming app that I use on my iPhone (HBOGo), and it wouldn't play the videos on the TV. I can connect to the YouTube content just fine through the app on the TV, so the internet streaming works on some platforms.There are a few problems with the \"magic remote.\" Clicking the remote doesn't always make the function work. At one point, I couldn't get the remote to do anything, and I had to turn the TV completely off and start over again. One recurring problem is that clicking on a \"fill-in box\" doesn't always bring up the keyboard. This model has a voice activation feature, but I haven't found a good use for it yet. I can't tell the TV to change the channel, because channel changing is a function of the cable box in my case, and the remote doesn't control the cable box. I did try telling it to \"return to Pandora,\" meaning the internet radio app that I had been listening to a couple of minutes earlier. It connected me to the Pandora jewelry site. I tried again: \"Go back to the Pandora app,\" and the little avatar shrugged her shoulders at me.The TV is supposed to be able to share content from your smartphone or your computer. The smartphone connection appears to be limited to phones with a certain feature that mine does not have. Sharing with the computer is done through a hard-wire connection, and I haven't tried setting that up yet, but I have no reason to believe that would be a problem if I cared to invest in the necessary connectors.So overall, I can say this is an excellent TV in terms of picture and regular TV viewing. I'm hoping that future software updates will fix the other issues.", "Date": "April 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Incredible picture, unmatchable 3D quality!", "Author": "Guy Goodpaster", "ReviewID": "R341TIWZGR1XAL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is amazing! I searched online and in stores for a good HDTV for a long time and finally found one that met all of my expectations. Here's just a few things I LOVED about this TV:-Great picture quality in 1080p... you can see every drop of sweat, every wrinkle...-The 3D is out of this world, especially with 3D Blu Ray movies... And the 2D to 3D conversion blew my mind!-APPS!  More apps than you can count, and you control everything with a remote that is motion controlled, just point and click at what you want!If you are looking for a quality, and I mean QUALITY HDTV, this is a must buy.  You won't be dissappointed!", "Date": "May 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Picky Customer That's Happy With Final Choice", "Author": "Jesrock", "ReviewID": "R1894LM5FJ4J5M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "EDIT (one month later): This TV is sadly going back. The flashlighting was noticeable in a couple corners when I was watching a movie that was extra wide screen so the black bars were on the top and bottom. After doing thorough research about this, I've come to find out that this is a common problem on edge-lit TV's. Your experience may be different or it may not bother you. Honestly, the rest of my family wasn't bothered by it. Since I do all the time-consuming research, I'm probably looking at any purchases with a more critical eye. I found experts saying that the best TV's to eliminate this flashlighting issue are Direct LED with Local Dimming (make sure it's not only direct LED). So I exchanged this model for the LG 60LA7400 LG Electronics 60LA7400 60-Inch Cinema Screen Cinema 3D 1080p 240Hz LED-LCD HDTV. This TV has Direct LED with Local Dimming. Note only the 60\" has this feature. I thought the 55LA6900 had a great picture, but the 60LA7400 is even better. So happy with the new TV and so happy that it's bigger. Not as sexy, but that's not what makes a great picture, right?ORIGINAL: I spent many hours, days, and weeks researching LED's. I even looked at the plasmas because they seemed to be more reasonably priced, but ultimately knew that my living room with some windows would cause too much glare. (This TV has enough of a matte finish that the glare isn't bad.) Then I saw 60\" TV's were becoming more popular and coming down in price. I almost settled on a Sharp 60\" 3D, Smart TV. I knew that if I had to buy glasses at almost $50 a pop for each family member, I probably would never use the 3D. Active 3D also gave me pause after reading that people are susceptible to headaches while watching Active 3D.Even though I didn't anticipate watching much 3D, it became a requirement after reading expert reviews. They all said that you should get 3D because the picture quality will be better so it can handle 3D, even if you know you won't be a 3D viewer. However, after viewing some of the free 3D content from LG's market, I was really impressed. It is fun to watch in 3D and the glasses that were included cover each one of my family members.It set up easily using wireless and ethernet. I prefer ethernet because it has a lot less buffering to do when watching online content. I installed a few free things from LG's market - Golf Lessons, a hidden object game, and some other game. Each was okay in its own right after a quick test of each. The hidden object game was fun because you use the Magic Remote. The accolades for the Magic Remote are well deserved. It's fun to use and the voice control is pretty nifty. I don't have a DVR set top box, nor a plethora of cable channels, so the basic channel changing is a non-issue for me. I like that whatever I'm viewing (which is usually from my HTPC) stays in view even though I'm in the Smart menu.The bezel is thin! It definitely gives the cinema effect. I read another user's review that took away a star because he didn't think it was thin enough. Personally, the edge to edge effect is pretty amazing. I like that this TV has a metal protector around its border. BTW, the bezel measures 3/8\" thick. It is beautiful, sleek and very sexy!The picture out of the box has a tiny soap opera effect (not drastic), but a quick change from the menu fixes that. I followed LCD Buying Guide's calibration recommendation. I will probably try to tweak it a little more or use one of the lower numbers from the 20pt table, but using the settings below helped.

They were supposed to call to schedule a drop-off day and time. I never got a call nor text, no notification whatsoever. Luckily I was home when they came. When I mentioned about not being contacted to the delivery guy, he said I was the 3rd person who told him that. The delivery guy was very nice and helped unpack it and verified it turned on. He would've even taken the packaging, but suggested it's a good idea to keep it in case something should happen.Bottom line, I really love this TV and am very happy that this is the TV that I ultimately chose. I was disappointed at first that it was only 55\" until I physically saw it in person. I couldn't be more pleased.", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing tv", "Author": "danny", "ReviewID": "R1GKRY9HWVINUP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Tv looks really beautiful, color is crisp, easy to set up, stand works well , 3d is cool also  easy to set up the remote and connect to the internet. Only down side was when it arrived the box was in good shape but 1 strap  was missing and it was falling out the bottom i was worried it was going to break or be damaged once i cut the strap around the box it basically fell out the bottom.

Nice features", "Author": "Water Monkey \"Marc B.\"", "ReviewID": "RMG5Z57639IF2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am giving the TV 5 stars based on the picture and the features.  The TV is not perfect in it's design of the Magic remote which affects universal remote owners (like the Harmony One) which I will go into later.  Now onto the review...Setting this TV up was a breeze.  We decided to place the TV on a credenza instead of the wall, so all we had to do was screw in 4 screws in the base.  Note: Let the bottom edge of the TV to hang over an edge to allow the stand to be placed properly.  I used our couch because it was soft and would prevent scratches to the screen. Once plugged in setting up the TV was a matter of connecting the cables and logging into our network.Instantly, I was less than amazed with the picture.  Yes, I was not pleased with the picture, but that is what I expected.  LG ships the TV in \"Standard\" picture mode.  In standard mode a normal live action show is too smooth.  You instantly see the effect of the 120Hz refresh setting on the 60Hz signal coming in.  Basically everything looks like live TV.  But, no worries LG provides an easy access menu on their remote that allows you to quickly cycle through the 6 preset video settings to determine which setting looks best.  Surprisingly, the setting we like best for most shows is called \"game\".  Want to see something odd?  My daughter was watching an old Abbott & Costello movie (B&W; of course) with the \"Vivid\" setting.  The picture was extremely clear, but felt fake.  It shows the power of the processor in the TV; great.  If these presets are good enough, you can edit each one yourself, or you can add two more yourself.  LG has a nice feature that allows you to reset the settings if you totally mess them up and can't get back.  So, wives fear not the TV is not ruined. Also, there are websites out there that can walk you through this, if you want.The menu system for the TV is clear and comes up quickly.  Having dealt with the menu system on my 46\" Samsung (which is known for being slow), the LG menus are instant. When you hit the smart menu button on the remote you are rewarded with a system of menu choices instantly.  LG does a nice job in dividing the content you can choose into understandable categories.So, last night we chose to test out the 3D aspect of the TV.  Since non of the rental places around us rent 3D discs; we rented one from the LG selection.  Within the 3D menus are about a dozen choices of movies you can rent and watch in 3D.  The kids chose Gnomeo & Juliet.  The LG uses passive 3D as opposed active 3D.  I have never been able to see a major difference within the 2 technologies except the price of the glasses.  Passive 3D is just like the 3D in the movies, and the nice things is the glasses are cheap.  The 3D worked well.  Seemed similar to the movie theater.  One thing I noticed, and it may be due to the size of the screen is that objects did not seem to float out in front of you as much as they do in the movies.  But the 3D was evident.Now to the remote.  At first I hated the Magic Remote.  Getting use to the gyroscopic feature can be difficult while trying to use the on-screen keyboard.  I did eventually get use to that.  Also you can turn it on and off if you prefer to use just the navigation buttons.  The one thing I hated about the remote was that LG decided to make some of the feature (like volume up & down) RF controlled instead of IR.  What that means to you? If you own a Harmony remote (which thousands of people do) that does not have RF capability, your Harmony will not control those features.  That's right Harmony owners you will need more than one remote.  To be fair to LG, I have the first generation of Harmony One remote which came out 4 or 5 years ago; it might be time for me to update my remote.  There is at least one Harmony that has RF capabilities.So, in conclusion, I could not be happier with the picture and the level of control LG gives me with this TV.  While the TV is 3D I would not buy the TV strictly for that feature only because I do not think it will be more than a fad for TVs.  Unless the NFL starts broadcasting in 3D!  Love the menu system.  For the price I believe you get a great set of features that really improve you TV watching experience.  We have noticed a huge difference between this LG and our 5 year old Samsung (which we love).  Along with the slim design, this TV is awesome.", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "So Far We Love This TV", "Author": "Lakersfan2282 \"lrobitai\"", "ReviewID": "R9MJRBTP7EP3A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have owned for two weeks so far. Let me preface by saying this HDTV was replacing a three-year old, Samsung 3D Plasma which we like a great deal but the screen cracked. The picture on this TV is superior and the Smart functionality has worked perfectly.  It has linked via my home wireless network without a hiccup when using Netflix, VUDU, and the proprietary web browser.  I also have to comment that the Magic Remote is a great feature and the voice recognition also performs extremely well.  My only recommendation is that you purchase HDMI cables with either a 90-degree angle or one that has both the angle and swivel-feature as the HDMI inputs on the TV towards the side and parallel to the screen and I was afraid to put additional stress on the connection with the conventional cables I had.The 2D to 3D conversion is pretty impressive and watching a 3D version of Avatar was pretty spectacular.  I spent a lot of time researching different brands and features prior to this and am very glad we made this choice.  We also took into consideration the cost of an extended warranty due to the problem with our Plasma and found the five-year warranty offered through Amazon to be the most cost effective compared to those offered by the Big Box stores.I also saw that a previous review had commented on the packaging of the TV.  Ours arrived with additional Styrofoam packaging on the exterior of the box on all corners and in the spans between.  The HDTV was unpack-aged by the delivery company and inspected for any damage prior to sign off.  Due to the temperature on delivery they were not able to plug it in and verify working condition which we did not consider to be an issue due to the manufacturer's warranty.In a nutshell I do not think you will be disappointed with the LG 55LA6900.", "Date": "April 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "A thorough (and long) review", "Author": "Ryan Winkleman", "ReviewID": "R3Q89U62YADKE8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Before you read any further, allow me to make this disclaimer first, as I've seen some confusion and concern from user comments on other reviews: I received this television for free as a member of the Amazon Vine program. I receive free items in turn for my reviews of them. That being said, my reviews are *always* objective and unbiased. For ease, I will review this in categories according to the main features that LG promotes from this television, i.e. those that are on its main product page, along with any others that I feel are important, including one that as of writing nobody else has mentioned (NFC). Note that I may update this review from time to time and will always put the updates at the bottom with a big note. So let's dive in to the LG 55LA6900 3D Smart TV!- Picture Quality: Simply put, the picture quality is fantastic. You're getting a 1080p 120Hz television, so you know that as of current standards, you've got the highest picture quality you can get with a very high refresh rate (there are higher now). Everything is crisp and clear now that I've got it set up the way I want it. That is to say, when I first turned the television on, I naturally looked for something interesting to watch that was on already; the best I could find was Austin Powers. I found that the screen kept getting fuzzy and losing its sharpness whenever any \"action\" happened, e.g. the opening dance scene. I went into the television's settings screen to the display settings and went through the whole customization mode, in which it ran the gamut of brightness, contrast, sharpness, etc. to get exactly what I wanted. Since then and coincidence or not, everything has been perfect. Your experience may be different. I have not had that fuzziness happen since I set it up. One of the interesting features you can turn on in the display settings screen is an eco mode, in which the screen will adjust its brightness according to ambient light. This is an energy-saving feature. I initially had this on, then one evening I was watching something and it suddenly got very dim and I had a hard time seeing anything. This was the eco mode adjusting the brightness to reflect the darker evening settings. I turned it off and everything was good again.- Magic Remote: The magic remote is pretty great. It controls all the main functions of the television and can operate via arrows or via a virtual mouse (think of the Nintendo Wii). There is a center button that you use to click what you want. When you first turn on the remote, it will ask you to \"register\" it with the television, and after that you're good. You can un-register and re-register it if you need to for some reason. Batteries are included. The mouse will show up if you press the center button, but it'll go away after five seconds of inactivity. All you have to do is press the button or wave the remote from side to side and it'll show up again. This prevents you from having to have the mouse on the screen all the time. One thing that I noticed that was really annoying at first is that the mouse tends to really easily get disoriented. It'll be way skewed from where it's supposed to be. LG gives instructions for how to re-calibrate it; basically just set it down for a couple minutes and then pick it up again. Don't want to wait that long? Here's a trick I found: just drag the mouse to the side of the screen to re-calibrate it yourself. For example, if the mouse is skewed to the right from where you think it should be just \"push\" the mouse against the right side of the screen a bit and it'll reorient it to center when you move it back away from the side.- Less Remotes: Yes, you can set the magic remote to control your different devices, including your cable box, your disc player, and your sound system. I do find it slightly easier to navigate my cable box with the regular remote, as I can then skip ahead or search numbers more easily, but in a pinch the magic remote still works okay. I have a Roku connected to the LG and I found that I can't connect that, as it asks for the manufacturer, and \"Roku\" is nowhere to be found. There is also a microphone function with the magic remote, in which you can speak into the remote and give it commands. I found that this was useless with apps, as \"open Netflix\" made it open a browser and search for Netflix, and similarly with YouTube.- Content and Apps: By pressing the \"SMART\" button on the magic remote, you get taken to the smart (home) menu where you can see all your app options and access your inputs and settings (the input list and settings menu are, by default, in a horizontal bar along the bottom of the screen). The television continues playing on the left side as a picture-in-picture. The apps are clearly organized into openable windows and are in categories such as premium apps, games, 3D content, on now, etc. Note that if you open the input or settings, you'll still have the television playing on-screen. If you open any of the app windows, the television will be closed and you'll be taken to a full screen menu. Unless I'm missing something, I don't find the app selections to be all that wonderful. The premium apps are all pre-installed already, like Neflix, Hulu Plus, YouTube, Picasa Web Albums, Facebook, etc. (but no Amazon Instant Video or HBO GO!!!!!!!), while regular apps and games have to be downloaded and installed from LG's smart app store (you've got about 1.6 gigabytes of hard drive space). Note that you WILL have to sign up for an LG account if you don't already have one in order to download new content. The Netflix app is good and works way better than the Roku one (which always gets stuck after every episode and won't advance). The YouTube app sucks. By default it opens up and shows you your suggestions based on your subscriptions, the same as the mobile or PC YouTube will do. However, *for the life of me I cannot figure out how to actually select any of the videos*. I click and click and they will not play. It's useless. The YouTube search function is marginally useful but is laborious.I skimmed through the games and didn't really see anything good. On the box it shows Plants vs. Zombies and other fun-looking games, but I couldn't find them in games list on mine. It was a couple \"name\" games and then a bunch of obscure stuff that I'd never heard of and that had bad user reviews. There are 2D and 3D games available. There don't seem to be a wide variety of good apps available yet, either. They are mainly a bunch of stuff that nobody's ever heard of, unfortunately. The \"on now\" menu seems like a great way to narrow down what movies are playing on television with clear icons to select rather than scrolling through the regular cable menu, but as I found, this actually connects by default to SD resolution. I pay extra through Cox for an HD receiver, so if I want to view HD content I still have to manually switch channels to the HD version afterward. You do have the option to search for content through the \"on now\" menu, and there is also an on demand section. With these two combined, you have a huge wealth of content that you can pull in over WIFI. Unfortunately as I discovered, you still have to pay for all of it. Since it gives you a list of movies and stuff already, I figured these were free and would rotate content or something, like how HBO GO does with movies but with subscription included with the television. Made sense to me. I clicked one and found that it wanted me to pay $17.99 for one movie. Sorry, no thanks! There is a separate store for 3D video, and you can rent movies from there as well.- Wireless Sharing and NFC: LG gives you the ability to share content amongst your television, your PC, your tablet, and your phone, at least in theory. The instructions for how to do this are not very good and it is confusing. LG gives you a \"tag on\" sticker that works for NFC. If you don't know what NFC is, it stands for \"near field communication\" and allows you to share content wirelessly between mobile devices by putting them close to each other or tapping them. Apple does not use it in their devices. Google started implementing it into Android with version 4.0, Ice Cream Sandwich, and it was first available in wide use on the Galaxy Nexus. Samsung made a big deal about it their ads for the Galaxy S3 (remember the ads in movie theaters with that guy saying to snap a photo of the movie screen and then share it with people who weren't fast enough? That's NFC). With the tag on sticker you just put it onto a non-metal area. I stuck it onto the plastic on the bottom back of the television. You then hold your device up to the sticker (note that at least in the Galaxy Nexus the NFC chip is in the battery, so you MUST have an original battery and not a third-party one) and it'll install a couple LG apps (about 11-12 megabytes total). Once you install them and get it up and running and paired with your television, in theory you can tap your phone to the sticker and it'll automatically open the video that's playing on the television on your phone and turn your phone into a remote. That means you can walk throughout your house and still see what's playing on the tv, as well as have basically full functionality and access to channel, volume, apps, etc. (everything you'd have from the magic remote, basically). I can't testify to how well this works, as evidently the Galaxy Nexus doesn't support second screen functionality, so I can control everything else, I just can't see the content on my phone.  I can't figure out how to use any of the other content sharing functionality. You have to download software from the LG website to use it with your PC, but I can't install it. I get an error midway through the installation and it aborts. Oh well. You can also use a direct connection to connect your devices to the television.- 3D: The 3D looks pretty good. I've never been a big proponent of it, I think it's a major gimmick and a fad, but it looks good. I've found that you need to be at a good viewing height and angle for optimal effect. The television comes with four 3D plastic glasses that are nothing special but work fine. They at least aren't cardboard! There is a button on the magic remote that allows you to turn 3D on while you're watching regular content, i.e. to convert from 2D to 3D. This is a subtle difference. To be honest, I wouldn't even know it's in \"3D\" unless I put the glasses on. It still looks 2D. But if you put the glasses on it is a clearer difference. Actual 3D content is different and absolutely requires glasses unless you want to feel like you're drunk while watching it.- Built-in WIFI: The WIFI is easy to set up. You just go to the settings screen and go to network connection (actually I think it prompts you the first time you turn the television on anyway) and it'll find your network. Just put in the password and you're good to go. I have found that on occasion it'll take a good 5-10 seconds to find my network sometimes after turning the television on, but most of the time it's already connected when the television starts up.- Audio: The television comes with 2.1 sound and it does sound good. You can have it adjust automatically for whatever content you're playing or just leave it to a standard level. I have no real complaints with the sound.- Miscellaneous: Some other random thoughts. 1) The packing was a little difficult. I recommend having two people. I unpacked it myself and am surprised I didn't drop the thing. Not only is it packed very tightly into the bottom when you're trying to pull it out of the box, but the thing weighs a ton. I mean really, it's a brick. I had serious difficulty picking this thing up on my own. On top of that, it has a very thin bezel. This is good because it maximizes your screen and makes it appear even bigger, but at the same time you are stuck grabbing directly onto the screen to pull it out of the box. Thankfully I did not damage it. 2) It comes with a stand that you can easily screw on to the back. 3) There is a web browser included, so you can surf the internet on your television. I haven't used this a whole lot but it seems to work like a normal browser. Note that it defaults to Bing for the search engine, so if you prefer Google or Yahoo then go to the settings menu and change it. One awesome thing is that you can turn on a function to have the television keep playing picture-in-picture while you're browsing. 4) I wish LG hadn't made everything so proprietary. The good thing about Android is that it's open source and can be manipulated however you want if you know what you're doing; unfortunately in cases like this you get stuck with all these LG-specific app menus with mostly unfamiliar content, when what would be great is if I could access my normal Android stuff as well. I understand stuff has to be optimized for the television, though.Overall I would highly recommend this television. It has its kinks and quirks and bugs that could be fixed, and hopefully future software updates will improve on those. When I bought my first television, I went against the \"smart TV\" thing and just got a regular one. I stand by that decision. I think it's useful to have it on this one, but it needs some updates and bug fixes to reach its full functionality. If you're in the same boat and are stuck between getting a regular television or paying hundreds extra for a smart one, if you're really having to think about it, I'd just go for the regular one. But if having a smart television means that much to you, this may be a good option. Once LG irons out some bugs and adds some actual useful apps, this has the potential to be a pretty powerful entertainment unit. Thanks for reading!EDIT: A couple things I've noticed over the last couple weeks: 1) As somebody else mentioned, the DST setting doesn't seem to work correctly when set to Auto. I didn't realize it at first or maybe it did and then stopped, but it was an hour off. I had to set the clock to manual and then input everything myself. And 2) lately the magic remote isn't always working. About 15-20% of the time when I click the button in the center, nothing happens. It's a little irritating.", "Date": "May 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Big TV :)", "Author": "Tracey Carter", "ReviewID": "R2HWZ05JE2WYGK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this TV. It is the perfect size for a single family home but might be too large for some townhouses and condos depending on the size and depth of the living room. It would also be a good size for basement movie rooms if you have the luxury of having such a place (I, woefully, do not).Set-up was very easy and hooking the TV up to my home wireless network took less than ten minutes, however, I've helped friends set up their SmartTVs and have experience setting up and troubleshooting home networks. If you've never set up a wireless TV before you may need a little bit of patience but if you follow the directions and reset routers and modems etc. as needed you shouldn't have too much trouble with it.So far I haven't been able to get Amazon Video to work on this SmartTV which is kind of a bummer if you have Amazon Prime but it looks like the SmartTV comes with apps for most of the other major streaming services (Netflix, etc.), none of which I have, of course. For streaming the Amazon Prime videos I hooked my PS3 up to the TV and then use the Amazon Video app on the PS3, so all is right with the world :)I haven't tried the 3D viewing yet but one great positive of this TV is that it came with not one, not two, not three, but FOUR pairs of 3D glasses which is great for families. My parents' 55'' Sony TV is also 3D ready but didn't come with any glasses which adds a bit of expense so it's wonderful that LG includes these with the TV.Overall I'm very pleased and am tickled pink to have found a wonderful TV. I'm usually a Samsung TV fan but I think I'm converted after seeing how wonderfully crisp, clear, and bright the picture is on this LG TV. And, if you don't like the picture for any reason, there are so many settings and options to be played with and tweaked, luckily I found one of the preset settings that worked well with my Comcast cable and makes everything super clear and wonderful.This TV is so large I haven't attempted to wall mount it because it would need a larger, more heavy duty wall-mount than most other TVs due to its size (and possibly weight, but given the size of this TV it was actually lighter than I anticipated).LG products are also long-lasting, quality products. We have an old (I don't even remember how old!) flat-screen HD tube LG TV that is still crisp and clear and bright and other than being very very heavy is still a wonderful TV. I'm hopeful that this new LG TV will last us just as long :)", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG LA6900 ... or should i say walking dead in 3D?!......", "Author": "Mr.Stocks", "ReviewID": "R2A8OLJ1LVR73Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am coming from a LG LE8500 Infinia 47 smart tv purchased in 2011.. I wanted to upgrade and take advantage of a tv set with 3D to have as an option and upgrade my tv size to a 55. now im not totally stuck on 3D but with all the awesome blu rays coming out now and technology i wanted to have this experience starting in 2014. after extensive research (as i do with all my products) and being that i was a previous LG owner i wanted to stick with the brand that i trusted. I wanted a good price and i was going with the GA7900 but couldnt find a good deal on the 55 inch. i shopped and shopped around until i was up one night and decided to look on amazon. and i came across the LG6900 for a great price in the 55 inch range.. i wanted 240hz but i said well let me just read reviews on this model and i was ok with the 120hz. and thats how i came up with this model.  Placed the order called amazon with question i had as i never purchased a big item like this from them before.. amazon customer service is great as always and the \"big ticket\" dept. answered my question efficiently and thoroughly and i get amazon reward credit to use as a promotion from this purchase.Delivery- I must point out that the delivery process was flawless i read alot of bad reviews about these companies i had CEVA and they were great tv arrived via CEVA they came within the time frame, opened the box, drilled the stand on. removed my prior set all in great time and were great about it.. got my tracking info, arrived the day they said it would, even called ahead of time and got answers. two gentlemen arrived and the time frame given originally . all in great presence. box was not damaged tv was not damaged everything worked out great. Thank you CEVA.LG LA6900-...  then i turned the tv and and WOW...the Picture looked amazing out of the box i couldnt believe it.  i starting going through the set up process which was fairly easy to navigate and do. the remote i had to get use to or \"magic wand\" i should say.  set everything up all is well. and i tried netflix. hulu. some blu rays etc. all looked great and i was loving the 55inches ! said i was in heaven. blacks are black, colors vibrant and popped!  thanks to the \"local dimming\" and \"led plus\"  in this set thanks to LG. i knew there was a break in period but as the days went by and to this day i am amazed at the picture quality. it was a step up from my LE8500 which was also great but i notice that processing and technology had changed since this set. the settings are easy enough to adjust straight forward. i didnt use any professional calibration but i have an experience with my prior sets and it worked out fine for me. the bezel-less frame looks great in the living room even when the tv is turned off. i have had people over and they cant believe how thin it was and turned the tv on and 2D/HD looked great. menus are easy to follow its so man options. but im no videophile but i will tell you this is a great looking tv set. if your one that dont care about the \"features\" or even 3D and just want a tv set then yes.. this is a great looking tv set afterall that was my first object. Dark scenes look excellent, i didn't notice any banding as the scenes transition. bright scenes were great very vibrant and colorful. its a great look. even apps like youtube from roku and apple tv looks great i go on youtube mainly from my tv now and as little as possible from the laptop. whites are white and vibrant. colors look accurate i love it. so i will tell you yes the tv is delivers on performance hands down in my opinion.3D- not huge on 3D BUT..... i tried THOR part 2 , Despeciable me, gravity!!, and a few more and WOW! the 3d looks great. being that its passive i had no problem getting use to it plus it was like going to the movies. and the set came with a box of four pair of 3D glasses, comfortable to wear for extended hours no problems. then i decided to try walking dead on a sunday night... HOLY S...!! it was great. i dont use the 3D alot but i wanted to see how good the 2D to 3D conversion works.. and let me tell you It did justice !. zombies movement was real. the ambiance of the atmosphere etc. it was freaking great!! i said yes... i now know what i been missing. I dont play video games so i wouldnt know what its like in 3d but overall 3D looks great. heck i might buy a xbox one or ps4 just because of how good it works later this year but for now i dont do gaming and all. havent tried sports yet in 3d either but i will eventually. overall it works pretty good. im hearing LG does 3d well overall.Smart Hub- netflix worked great. hulu was fine. but i have an apple tv, roku 3, preordered the new roku streaming stick coming out next month, so i dont use this feature much along with the apps and all. maybe one day i'll play around with it but i mainly wanted a great picture to start with.. but i have great wifi in my home very fast. and i have the tv on wifi its nice to have in case i need it in the future but im more of a media box such as roku and apple tv kind of guy. but you can also hook up via ethernet cord as well and its plenty of apps to play around with.Remote- works great. it does take some getting use to, my hand to eye correlation is pretty good. got it down pat within a few hrs but i use a standard remote  for watching movies due to play and pause and all. but its great kind of cool the whole \"mouse effect and i think anyone can get use to it. and the voice search feature is great to i tried it a few times to see how it well it works and its cool a young lady pops up and listens to what your searching for kind of funny lol. nice work LG.Overall I say its a great tv set that only gets better as you view it for the long run. havent had any problems, no dead pixels thank god, and i enjoy it. it was a great upgrade. looks good at night and in the daytime. has some clear coat on tv screen itsself so reflection and glare  is not  bad. all viewing angles are great from left to right didnt have problems with that. have had people over to enjoy 3D viewing and 2D all have been impressed although i wanted to make sure at the end of the day i was satisfied. im happy with this option i choose. and like the prior set happy with this model even more.So I say get it and see it for yourself its great. hope this review helped and please dont be afraid to ask any questions and ill answer to my best ability.", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worth Every Penny", "Author": "Verdell82 \"Amy\"", "ReviewID": "R5E1LQQ8J3LPR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not being someone who knows much about tv's, I don't really understand specs, but I understand what I can do and see.

It is also a bit too large to use as a computer monitor without sitting that same distance away. It is roughly 48 1/2 in. wide and 31 in. tall including the stand. Depth is about 3 in. without the stand and about 13 in. with the stand. A horizontal surface of about 29 in. wide and 14 in. deep is needed to hold the stand.It is heavy enough that the handyman in my building said he couldn't mount it to the wall without opening up the plaster and putting in some lumber supports. If there are children in the house, the television should be secured for safety. However, the stand is very stable and easily swivels to adjust the viewing angle.Set-up is easy. The top and sides of the carton are held to the bottom with strapping and when it is cut, they slide right up and off. There are lots of ports on the back to accommodate various types of input and output. Setting up a wireless connection with the computer was simple and trouble-free but I settled on using an ethernet cable as that is more reliable and less fussy in general.There is a ridged metal rim around the outside edge of the set but the 1/2 in. bezel is set behind the glass. There are no missing pixels that I can find. The picture quality is really very nice, with excellent contrast and brightness, beautifully intense colors, and sharp edges with no artifacts or fuzziness except when watching low-quality video files.This LG television not only plays 3D films, it will also convert regular films to 3D and there are several different types of 3D to choose from. Some films that are not 3D significantly benefit from being converted to 3D while others are not noticeably different. To see the 3D effect, it is necessary to wear the special glasses, so people who wear prescription glasses and don't have contacts should consider that. It is also suggested that younger people are better able to appreciate the 3D than older people. I have enjoyed experimenting with the 3D but have decided that for me, it is more of a novelty than a necessity, although I remember the same thing was said about color picture tubes and then about cable when they were introduced.Because the light source is LED, it is very energy-efficient. The Energy Guide estimates an annual electricity cost of $11 which is off the low end of the official scale on the sticker, which goes from $24 to $73 for models of a similar size.This television is intended to be used with a separate speaker set or headphones and the sound quality is excellent when used with either while lacking in comparison when using only the single speaker in the back of the set.The little remote is very intuitive although it did take me a while to figure out that when it goes to sleep, a little shake from side-to-side will wake it up. The software is more complex and not as intuitive and is sometimes frustrating. The television software is easy to navigate but the media server software for the computer is not LG-proprietary--it is Nero MediaHome 4 Essentials and there is much better software available even for free, such as PlexMediaServer, so I would suggest putting some time into researching media server software and even considering buying it to improve the experience. I have not even been able to get the Nero software to catalogue an entire 3 TB drive without crashing. The voice recognition software works okay but I usually have to repeat myself a few times to get it to do what I want it to.Overall, this is a very nice television, well-made and with a beautiful picture. I have really enjoyed watching films on it, both color and black & white. People who don't have a large television with a picture of this quality should consider getting one if they enjoy watching television.", "Date": "May 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG keeps getting better", "Author": "owookiee \"owookiee\"", "ReviewID": "RLDMILXU2HQT9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Before I sing the praises, the things I dislike about this TV:-The cable and component jacks are in the back of the TV pointing backwards.  This made the cords hit the wall and prevented me from mounting the TV on the wall until I purchased right-angle adapters for the jacks, and even then it was tight.  I'm not sure why flat tv producers make this decision knowing their TVs will likely be mounted.  The HDMI ports are aimed sideways, however, they are not near the edge of the TV, so they're pretty impossible to reach also once the TV is mounted.-The bezel doesn't overlap the screen, so there's separation there that could allow dust/liquid to get in.  If there's ever any twisting or shearing this gap will become larger, so be careful when you're moving this thing around and hanging it.-The remote is basically a wii controller, and they opted to not put a number keypad on it.  To jump to another channel you have to pull up the on-screen keypad, click in the number of the channel, and then select it from the found list.  This can be difficult for anyone with imprecise hand-eye coordination, though it does serve as a roadblock to my toddler messing with it.-The back of the TV is a very flimsy metal.  I actually carved a dent in it just by rubbing against it with one of the rivets in my jeans.  I assume the mount points are reinforced.-If you're watching Netflix and want to change the aspect ratio, you have to exit to the SmartTv settings screen, interrupting your movie.Without the stand, the thickest part of the TV is at the bottom, which is 2.5\" deep.  The mount points are inset more, and when mounted it is very flush against the wall.  The mount points are located at the corners of a 15.75\" square.Other than that, the TV is amazing.-No noticeable blurring on fast action.  (If you haven't had a 120hz+ TV before, one thing you will notice is it's so clear you can tell most sitcoms are filmed on sets, you lose that \"cinematic\" feel the blurring gives on lesser TVs)-The colors are deeper and blacks are way better than the RCA LCD this is replacing.  It does okay in a sunny room, though my white molding will be visibly reflected when sun shines on it.-Full web browsing, and I was able to stream full-screen from YouTube and Twitch.tv at various quality rates.  I'm not sure if it's due to the internal wifi tech, but it takes several seconds to initially get going and was smoothest at 720p or under (even though on my wired computer I can stream 1080p fine).-The selection of apps by default is pretty good, and they built it to be expandable, so you're not locked into a certain set like with other devices such as AppleTV.-It \"discovered\" rather quickly (without me doing anything) the shared folders I had on my other computers.-It has voice recognition so you can click the button and say \"youtube justin timberlake videos\" and it automatically hits the web and pulls up a list.  You can also \"turn to channel 44\", though I've had lesser success with it recognizing the right channel.-I'm not too big on the 3D.  It's neat in some situations, but unlike the red/blue 3D of yesteryear, instead of things popping out at you into the living room they are only visually pushed back to give depth.I own many LG products from washers to vacuums to computer monitors and have been very pleased with their quality and dependability.", "Date": "May 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "We love it! highly recommend", "Author": "Viola C.

Most of you reading this are probably shopping for a replacement for an old and/or dead TV.  So let's approach this review from that angle: a comparison of my new 55\" LG set with the deceased five-year-old upper-mid-range 46\" Sony it replaced.  This should give you a good idea of what to expect relative to your old TV, plus a little insight into how the state of the art has changed over the past few years.Good:- The LG's exterior is, in a word, stunning.  Powered off, it looks like a sheet of plate glass with a logo at the bottom, and it isn't a whole lot thicker than plate glass.  It is, in fact, so thin (1.4 inches) that I was almost afraid to lift it out of the box.  (Once out it seemed solid enough, although I strongly doubt it would tolerate much rough handling.)  The Sony was about five inches thick, and was almost the same height and width (maybe two inches narrower) owing to a 2-1/2\" frame around the screen, plus a three-inch speaker bar on the lower edge.  Both seemed to weigh about the same (44 lbs. per LG's website.)- Both sets have a good selection of inputs, both with three HDMI jacks, component in, and analog / digital audio out.  The LG has no less than three USB jacks (Sony: one) which strikes me as excessive but could be useful at some point.  The Sony TV had a PC video jack that the LG lacks, which I found useful on occasion, but my laptop has HDMI out (as most do nowadays) so this isn't a big loss.  One nice feature of the LG set is a number of anchor points on the back panel for specialized cable ties (one included) to serve as strain relief for all that cabling.  If your set is well up off the floor as ours is, this avoids a lot of potential grief by taking the stress off those delicate HDMI jacks.  The LG also has wired and wireless Internet connections the Sony lacked.Tip: If you're installing this on a wall mount, you'll need a second pair of hands despite its modest weight.  Do not wear jewelry, or clothing with a belt or metal buttons. You *will* rub up against that screen at some point and, while it doesn't look as though it'd be easy to scratch, why tempt fate?Also, if you're using that strain-relief tie (and you should,) plan your cabling before tying it.  They only give you one, and it doesn't look like something you could find at the hardware store if you make a mistake and have to cut it off.- The LG's picture is every bit as impressive as its exterior.  Its LED edge lighting is much brighter and more even than the Sony's cold-cathode backlight, helping to give it a substantially brighter and more vivid image. Both have clear, razor-sharp pictures with good contrast, especially when fed a Blu-ray 1080p signal.  Both have good viewing angles, and both do a good job of up-converting old-standard broadcast and DVD to 1080p 120Hz, although I think the Sony does better in this regard (see below.)- Being a 2013 model \"smart\" TV, the LG has a lot of features that were all but nonexistent when the Sony was new.  The most prominent of these is Internet connectivity, affording access to all the usual streaming video services e.g. Netflix, plus a selection of apps for Web browsing, music, weather, and a lot more.  So far I've tried Netflix, Amazon streaming, Hulu, and local DLNA streaming from my laptop, all of which work perfectly.  (It doesn't yet support Netflix's new multiple-queue feature; LG says this will be added Real Soon Now.) (UPDATE 1/4/14: They finally upgraded it.) The on-screen controls for these apps (and in general) also respond a LOT faster and more smoothly than those on my two-year-old net-enabled DVD player (also LG.)Tip: If you're planning on streaming HD video, set up a hardwired network connection - don't use the wi-fi.  My \"smart\" LG DVD player would stutter badly when wirelessly streaming HD unless the wi-fi router was literally sitting on top of it, and it turns out this LG TV isn't much better in that regard.  I hardwired the DVD player's net connection a week after buying it, and had no problems with even 720p video thereafter.  After one brief experiment with the TV's wi-fi, I hardwired it as well.  For lower quality YouTube-ish streaming, web browsing, games and such, wi-fi should be adequate if you have a good signal.- The 3D experience was actually quite a bit better than I'd expected from playing with this set at the local Costco (whose price was $150 less than Amazon's - sorry guys.) It turns out there was a good reason for this (see below,) but once I had the set and player set up properly the result was pretty good.  It won't put the theaters out of business anytime soon, and I won't be going (far) out of my way to buy 3D films, but it is kinda fun.  N.B.: I am one of those fortunate souls who has no trouble dealing with 3D movies, the glasses, etc.  If you get dizzy or headachy watching 3D in the theater, you'll probably have even more trouble with 3D TV content.Bad:- The one feature of this set that I distinctly do NOT like is the remote control.  It looks remarkably like a fake-chrome-plated Star Trek TNG phaser - so much so that I have to wonder whether the resemblance is coincidental.  The controls are minimal and not very well thought out - do we really need a dedicated 3D on/off button? - and for functions past the basic volume, channel, etc. it's rarely obvious which button gets you to the function you want.  The center \"OK\" action button is also a scroll wheel and quite awkward to use one-handed, plus the scroll wheel itself is pretty much useless.  The Wii-like remote-tracking on-screen cursor is pretty slick, but again it's difficult to keep the cursor where you want it while clicking that stiff center button/wheel.  I tried to cope with this thing for a week, then dug out my old Harmony universal remote and reprogrammed it for the new TV.  Aside from those few functions it doesn't support, it works quite well.- The \"magic\" voice command requires an Internet connection, which the TV has, but it's a moot point because as best I can determine voice activation doesn't work at all - every time I hit the microphone button on the remote, the TV insists that I go through the same setup process I performed the first time I turned it on.  The last software update didn't fix this; maybe the next one will.- Sound quality is roughly the same for both old and new sets; that is to say, OK for broadcast viewing but unspectacular for movies or concerts.  The Sony had two full-range speakers firing forward from a narrow bar under the screen.  They sounded good, but maxed out quickly when challenged with audio with a lot of dynamic range (again, movies and concerts.)  The LG set takes a different approach with rear-facing stereo speakers plus a small sub-woofer packed into that inch-and-a-half-thick case.  It's a little hollow-sounding from that bounce off the back wall, and stereo imaging suffers - even with a test video I found it hard to distinguish right from left channels.  Sum of topic: if you like your audio loud and crisp, plug this beast into a component A/V receiver.- I mentioned earlier that the LG does not do a spectacular job of up-converting old 30-frame DVD and broadcast video to 1080p / 120Hz, and it turns out that Consumer Reports shares that opinion.  Both the LG and Sony do this reasonably well, mind you - switching off conversion on either set made standard-definition video almost unwatchable - but the Sony's picture was consistently sharp and clear, whereas the LG's picture blurs noticeably with fast motion or lower quality broadcast video.  There are a couple of picture quality settings I'm still experimenting with, so there may still be a little room for improvement here.- It turns out that there are two 3D modes on this beast.  One is for true 3D source material, and switches on automatically when it detects a 3D signal.  The other is switched on and off manually, and performs what is undoubtedly some wicked signal processing to try to turn a 2D picture into 3D.  Emphasis on \"try.\"  This is what we were seeing in the Costco that day and it's pretty bad, enough to where I wonder why they bothered including this feature.  If you really want to watch 3D, skip the ersatz mode and get a 3D-capable Blu-ray player and true 3D discs.Bottom line: While writing this, I kept wanting to refer to this LG TV as looking like something out of science fiction, but I don't recall ever seeing a video display this attractive and sharp-pictured in any SF show.  (\"The Jetsons,\" maybe. :) )  It's clear that the state of the art in video has come a long way in only a few years.  This 55\" LG set is superior in almost every way to the five-year-old 46\" Sony it replaced... and it cost about $200 less.  Five stars.", "Date": "August 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "How Do I Love Thee?", "Author": "MacGuffin \"MacGuffin\"", "ReviewID": "R2VTRHYFER3LRA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After pinching myself black and blue, I came to accept the fact that I was going to be the proud owner of a 55\" Smart TV (fortunately, I'm one of the lucky Manhattanites who can accommodate such a behemoth). I awaited the arrival of my LG 55LA6900 Cinema Screen 3-D Smart TV with bated breath.I wasn't disappointed.First, the pros. Setting up the 55LA6900 was a piece of cake (in part, no doubt, because much of it consisted of connecting the cables that I'd disconnected from my old set into the proper ports). Granted, two people are necessary to in order to accomplish this (i.e., the actual installation), but this is only for the purpose of assembling (dead-easy) and moving the set to wherever it's going to reside. Mine isn't wall-mounted so I can't comment other than to note that a wall mount isn't included although instructions are.I expected that setting up the LG 55LA6900 proper, like just about all home entertainment equipment these days, was going to be a daunting undertaking given that manuals for said equipment tend to be, to state it kindly, opaque. Nothing could have been farther from the truth, however, because for the most part, I had mine set up in minutes. My only problem was running it through my cable box (I'm a DVR subscriber). An extremely short phone call to my provider cleared up how to locate Channel 3 on the set while in the \"Input List\" menu, and that--after being exhorted to pick up a free HDMI cable from my location of choice--was it. I don't think I spent more than an hour total, if that, none of it frustrating.After years of watching TV on a small, conventional set, I was unprepared for the glories of a large screen. The LG 55LA6900 has a gorgeous picture and despite complaints about black levels for LCD-LED sets, I have no such complaints--contrast is as it should be, colors pop, and sharpness...well, I never realized how much bad skin there is among entertainers. I'm disinclined to move my ancient stereo speakers out of my bedroom and so am relying on the 55LA6900's own speakers; they sound terrific and, not unsurprisingly, audio (and video) values can be tweaked to one's own preferences. I'm led to believe that the 55LA6900 is energy-efficient as well, which is another bonus.Having Internet access on my TV is wonderful and configuration for achieving it was just one more painless component of the setting-up process. I can, if I'm so inclined, watch YouTube, plus subscribe to a number of other services including Netflix and Hulu Plus (alas, Hulu isn't available). Other than the demo, I haven't yet availed myself of the 55LA6900's 3-D capabilities; unless my hopes that proper releases of \"Dial M for Murder\" and \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\" are realized, it's not a feature I think I'll be using often. I am, however, glad I have it--who knows when I might change my mind? Software updates are essential for your 55LA6900 to perform at peak; users can either opt for manual or automatic depending on their own usage preferences.The cons are few but this wouldn't be an accurate review without mentioning them. First, the dreaded \"burn-in.\" It was my understanding, prior to owning a flat-screen TV, that this was a potential condition that plagued plasma sets more than LCDs. Imagine my shock upon discovering that p. 5 of the owner's manual devotes a section to just this possibility. This is a blow to someone like me. MOST of the content I watch is vintage, filmed in good ol' Academy Standard and I want to watch it the way it was filmed. The manual recommends not watching such content for more than 2 hours at a time (IOW, ciao, Gone With the Wind). Research online indicates that what's more likely is \"image retention,\" which, unlike burn-in, is a temporary condition. I seem to recall reading that even plasma sets are much less susceptible to burn-in after 100 or so hours of screen-filling viewing, so on that basis, I've been watching everything in \"Cinema Zoom 16\" for the time being (you can clock your hours by clicking the \"Support\" icon, then \"Product/Service Info\" while in the \"Settings\" menu. Please believe me that I doubt anyone is fussier about viewing media in its original aspect ratio(s) than I; however, I'm pleased to observe that \"Cinema Zoom 16\" manages not to result in that horrifying horizontal stretch one sees when viewing 4 : 3 content in widescreen. Granted, backgrounds are fuzzier than they should be but all in all, it's a painless way of trying to avoid burn-in (I hope it works).I'd also add that for some reason, the Daylight Savings Time option doesn't work when set to \"Auto.\" Mind you, having not grown up on it, I hate DST but I'm in the minority and--more importantly--it's a fact of life and has to be acknowledged. Maybe I'll have more luck with it in the fall. I've also noticed that sometimes, my DVR menus are blurred; this might be due to a recent software update. It doesn't happen on a consistent basis but at this price point, I don't think it should be happening at all.Finally (and this is minor, but my opinion was solicited here), I find the Magic Remote a tad too fiddly for my taste; my experience is that the merest touch activates it. Again, a quibble, but I thought I'd mention it.All in all, I LOVE my LG 55LA6900. I've found that flat-screen viewing can be a little disconcerting (if often seems that everything has been videotaped live, like a soap), but I've become used to it and can't believe home TV viewing can be so much fun. I've read reviews to the effect that similar Samsung entries into the realm of 3-D Smart TVs might edge out LG but honestly, I don't know how much better they could be. Unless one is springing for a Runco (a whole different and higher order of home theater), I don't know how anyone could be dissatisfied with an LG set.

It was a great tv too but did not have the LG magic remote which I love.  The 6900 is an awesome tv.  I would highly recommend it.  I had a issue with Netflix not working and LG tech support ended up dispatching a tech to my home.  He fixed it in 5 minutes.  Apparently the tv needed to be reset..something about the firmware.  LG tech support was very helpful but not sure why they didn't suggest that in the first place.  Netflix works like a charm now.This TV has a fantastic picture and the sound is MORE than adequate for my bedroom.  The magic remote controls the cable box too and can control other devices.  It really is a neat remote especially if you like playing around with the smart features.LG also has a really neat smart remote app for my android phone.  I love it...because when my kids misplace my remote, i can use the one on my phone.  Using my phone, I can hear the tv on my headphones so my wife doesn't get disturbed.  That itself is an awesome feature......you can also switch video between the phone and the tv.I like this so much more than  the M series tv from Vizio.  While the Vizio had a great picture, it just cannot compare with the LG.  The remote on the Vizio was subpar.  Nice layout but just not the nicest remote to use.Haven't tried the 3D on this tv, will eventually get around to it.  I do have a LG 60LA7400 and the 3D on that is outstanding!!!

I spent a lot of time looking at different sets and comparing user reviews on a few different audio video forums. The only issue I have noticed with this set is the flashlighting in the corners but it's barely noticeable and I can only see it when the room is pitch black and I'm watching a movie that has black bars along the top and bottom. If its daytime I can't see it. There is no bleed through on the edges at all. And again if I hadn't read about the fact that this problem exists I probably wouldn't have even noticed or been looking for it.The flashlighting seems to be a fairly common complaint with edge lit LED displays doesn't seem to matter what manufacturer, model or price of the set from what I could gather. Having the screen calibrated correctly seems to reduce this for some people.The 3d while wasn't my main reason for purchasing this set is much cooler than I thought it would be. I've seen a few 3d movies in theater but never gave much thought to having It In the house. The pop out effects look amazing and it offers some great depth as well. Blacks on this display look great and the colors pop well.I am also using this display as a gaming monitor. Input lag was very frustrating until I switched it to game mode under the tv input settings. Then it was fine. I was not really happy with the 3d gaming. I'm using an AMD Radeon 7950 to power the display for the computer. And I tried the TRIDEF middleware software for the 3d conversion. I haven't put a lot of effort into making the games work well it might not be an entirely fair review but I wasn't ready to put a lot of work into it either. I tried both diablo 3 and starcraft 2 neither of which I felt played well with the 3d on. I did try tomb raider which works natively without the need of middleware and felt that actually worked pretty decent and did actually really add to the atmosphere of the game. However there are only a handful of games that support AMD cards in 3d without the extra software.I can't really comment on the sound quality as I have everything running through my surround sound receiver.Hope this review is helpful to someone.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "3D Dual Play TV", "Author": "A.

I searched and searched for a TV that would fit our needs and budget.  After a few weeks of shopping and reading endless reviews I decided on this one.  Packaging by LG and delivery by amazon was great.  Although I left it in the box since I was going to be moving it again.  Delivery guys were more than happy to do that!  Some impressions after a month of use:-Simply a stunning picture.  Crisp, clean& bright.  Virtually zero light bleed and lag that you might get with comparable 120hz tvs.-Thin bezel is really nice and the frame is quietly there.  Looks awesome hanging on the wall.-Smart tv interface is really nice and much easier to use than I had expected (read some reviews and had moderate expectations)-HAS amazon prime video app preinstalled (however, it did require an update to the Smart tv features upon hooking up to wifi)-With quality broadband internet the streaming starts almost immediately and is in HD in mere seconds.-Remote is nice although I have not used the search assistant yet....haven't needed to (says something about the Smart tv interface)-Sound is really good for this thin of a tv.  It took some tweaking to get it right for the room though.  Really considering not buying a soundbar.-Wii type remote arrow goes away after 5 seconds and works really well too.  There is a button on the remote that activates the arrow again when it goes away.  It does not just come back on if you bump the remote as other reviews have indicated.Couple of minor problems:-If you internet goes down you have to reconnect, including reentering your password....Pain if you have a generic password on your wifi.-Screen is glossy.  Our room is not bright, but not a dark room either.  You see reflections in darker scenes.  Lighter scenes it does not show any reflections.-Screen also makes a rainbow light affect with certain lights.  I have two pendant lights behind our viewing area and they have the new \"specialty\" old fashioned type light bulbs.  Those really throw a rainbow prism type affect.  The CF lights in our can lights really don't do it much at all.  So, keep that in mind if you have lights directly behind your viewing spot.These are minor quirks to me that you are going to get with any tv on the market.  They are far outweighed by the stunning picture and great looking tv.

The picture is bright and beautiful, the WiFi connectivity is great, the unit is light weight, and it's Energy Star compliant.  I loved watching TV on it.  Navigating was another matter entirely.The major problem with this TV is how it interfaces with the LG \"smart\" remote.  The remote, though sleek and stripped down, leaves a lot to be desired.  One of the main issues is how it would drive my Comcast DVR.  When fast-forwarding or rewinding, it was not uncommon for me to have to hit the \"play\" button three or four times before the command would take.  It was almost impossible to end up where I wanted to be in a video.  There's also some sort of glitch where (I believe), if you don't turn the system off just right, the television fails to boot the set-top cable box upon turning it back on.  I'd have to turn the unit off and on repeatedly until, miraculously, everything would work again.Other complaints:* the processor inside the TV is fairly slow.  The Roku I'd planned on replacing with the TV's smart features far outpaced anything the TV could do in terms of accessing streaming video.* the connectivity with Netflix and Amazon Instant Video worked well enough otherwise, but YouTube is a different story.  The unit pushes you to use your smartphone or tablet to search and play from YouTube (via a pairing feature), which kind of defeats the purpose of having a single, centralized device running everything.  Using only the TV, it is very difficult to search for and play videos from YouTube.* TruMotion (a.k.a., the \"soap opera effect\") is the default setting on the television, making everything shot on film look as if it were shot on cheap video.  Though the picture is bright and clear, the look is dreadful--the opposite of cinematic.  I cannot imagine why anyone would want to use this feature, let alone as the default picture setting.  Worse, you have to turn off TruMotion for each and every input you use, and it's not always clear how one goes about doing that.  I was able to figure it out eventually, but it took more time than it should have, and I had to suffer through more than a few horrible-looking programs along the way.Bottom line: this is a TV with tremendous potential, but one whose potential is all but eclipsed by the numerous  frustrations it produces during use.  You shouldn't have to fight your technology--at least not in this day and age--and yet that's precisely what you have to do to get this unit to work close to the manner it should.Much to my chagrin, I've scheduled a return.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is an awesome TV", "Author": "Eric C.

But the Sony had a great picture and I saw so many mediocre HD screens at crappy bars and friend's homes that I just couldn't bring myself to part with it.

Set up was easy. Hookup was easy. Remote control was easy. Everything is just intuitive and easy. And once my cable company turned on the HD signal, I could hardly believe my eyes.

I watched a comcast channel that was not HD and wasn't very impressed; but then watched a blu-ray video in 1080P and was completely stunned by the immaculate picture quality. It's my understanding that the 2014 NFL season will offer a 3D feed on Monday night games. 2D-3D converter is just okay but 3D from a 3D source is absolutely stunning! To watch a 3D video you will also need a 3D blue-ray player. If you don't yet have one there is an array of short stunning videos in 3D world in the apps section of your tv that require only your 3D glasses. My favorite feature is the USB port. I bought an external WD hard drive and installed my videos and music on it from my pc and now all my media entertainment is at my fingertips. No more looking for videos or cleaning disks.  The tv does offer media-share where your pc and tv communicate so you can share media from your pc. This feature requires you to download and install an app to your pc. But be forewarned. After installing this app it works fine but my internet browser had become hijacked with browser redirects and ad/spyware obviously bundled with the download. The download was obtained from LG.com. Luckily I had a saved backup image to re-install windows from after the infection of my pc. The tv stand is another plus. Very strong and stable. I don't particularly like wall mounts because they require drilling holes in your drywall. If the tv and mount need to be moved later you have quite an eyesore where the tv once was. As I said before it's not perfect. My chief complaint about this tv is the processor is a bit slow. Internet speed on my computer from comcast is lightning fast; yet the tv internet is painfully slow. The slower internet speed on the tv has to be attributed to an inferior cpu as opposed to the cpu in my pc.

Mohring", "ReviewID": "R1T4BRPX7R4NDN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tv looks wonderful on or off. I bought it mostly for it's unique frame design. It's actually not the thinnest frame out there (top and side frames are about 7/16\")...more expensive Samsung 240hz models are a bit thinner. But in some ways it looks thinner, especially when off because the semi-glossy screen covers everything. When viewed from front it looks all black and evenly glossy except for a tiny, non distracting pop of real metal on the sides and the black strip on the bottom. I wish the metal on the sides and top of the screen was smooth not corrugated (though you can only tell from close up) but it's not only the only tv with a screen that covers the whole front but the only tv I know of with real metal used in the design instead of just plastic painted to look like metal. Subtitle but impressive in a way.Turned on the picture looks fantastic, but not without some tweaking. Google picture settings for this model and you'll find precise 20 point white level settings (whatever that means) that make the tv colors look great. I still tweaked the basic settings a bit, turned up sharpness to 30, turned on user trumotion with dejutter at 0 and debur at 10 (no soap opera effect this way!), turned on edge enhancer (though purists say this is bad I thought it made the picture look crisp), noise reduction to low...but left most other features off. Disappointingly the local dimming feature that was a reason I wanted this tv is no good. In shows with lots of dark scenes like boardwalk empire it's distracting to have the blacks on the side of the screen with a window or light look lighter than on the side of the screen without any lighter elements. I turned off the feature then tweaked contrast, brightness and backlight till I was satisfied and the blacks stay consistent now.I was shocked at the 3d with this tv. It's SO GOOD! Life of pi blu ray on it looked fantastic. It's not why I bought this tv yet it's impressed not only me but everyone I showed it to...though it's best when viewed close and straight on. 3d is not \"in\" right now, so to be presented with fantastic 3d is nice surprise. The 2d to 3d feature is stupid though lol.Can't comment on the smart tv since I have my tv connected to an even \"smarter\" home theater pc :)Delivery: was told to watch out for this. Amazon used fedex. Was weird that they didn't require a signature on this expensive delivery but either way there were no issues with delivery.This tv is't the best 46-47\" on the market but for the price it's the best value in a high end looking tv for well under 1k.

I currently have 2 other HDTVs (both 32\") in the bedrooms but this is my first \"big\" TV purchase. My previous TV was an almost 13 year old Sony KV-32HS500. It was a beast weighing almost 200lbs. The LG only 38lbs. I had promised my wife that I wouldn't replace it until it died, and she held me to my word lol.I have had this TV now for 2 weeks and thought now was a good time for a review. I may update this in the future if something should ariseThe LG is a thing of beauty when not powered on. The edge to edge glass and hardly any visible bezel really is eye catching. When powered on, the bezel is then visible but barely, and it comes alive with a beautiful crystal clear picture (you may have to tweak the settings to your liking). Out of the box the picture was dull and way too bright. My fav setting was Cinema with the TRU MOTION turned off. While doing my research I came across a site(lcdtvbuyingguide) that had posted their calibration settings. It was a process to set it but once done the picture was AWESOME. I may purchase the Disney Wow: World of Wonder in the future but right now I am happy with my settings.The sound is truly amazing with the built in sub woofer, best sound I have heard from any HDTV IMO. It made me telling the wife of the need for a sound bar rather difficult lol. I may get one in the future but for right now I am truly happy with the audio. It has 5 audio presets and 1 user setting.Once I powered the TV and setup the wireless network, which was real easy. It updated to the latest firmware rather quickly. It does come loaded with the Amazon Instant Video App as well as Netflix, VUDU, Hulu Plus, YouTube, and others but I really only use the Amazon and Netflix. The Netflix app loads quickly (quicker than my Roku) and loads movies/TV shows quickly as well( again much quicker than my Roku). I experience no buffering issues with standard video playback but did have buffering issues when playing two 3D movies on Netflix. Watched the Immortals 3D and it froze and buffered twice, going back to a previously viewed scene and not the scene where it froze. I then watched Nitro Circus 3D and again it buffered twice. My connection is 50 up/25 Down, so i don't think it was my wireless connection. I haven't tried a wired connection and I don't think I really need to since I've watched a couple  of movies on Amazon as well with no buffering issues at all.The 3D really is impressive with the ability to upscale 2D content to near 3D is amazing.I've really gotten use to the Magic Remote. It's Wii like pointer makes typing and selecting much easier than having to arrow your way around with a usual remote. It fits in the hand rather nicely and I pretty much only use it now. It's easily programmable. Set up my cable box, and Blu Ray player with ease. The only con is that there aren't any PLAY,STOP,FF or REW buttons to control a DVR or Blu Ray player, but there is a pull down onscreen remote that has those buttons. So when I'm watching a show on my DVR I use the Cable box controller for that. And thats really the only con I have for this TV.I am very happy with my decision and have gotten many compliments from family and friends about it as well.Truly an amazing TV", "Date": "October 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Superb 3D TV !!!", "Author": "LA! \"laissa_266\"", "ReviewID": "R3LEBACVUCO374", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I Love this TV it has an Amazing passive 3D Not like the active 3D I tried it and make me dizzy.

I wanted a TV that had a thin bezel, great picture, good gaming performance, and smart features; this TV has all of these. The picture is everything I need. There are other TVs with a 240hz refresh rate, but it doesn't do any good. HD TV shows and blu rays are only putting out 60hz, and 60hz is all you need for gaming. Going with this one at 120hz is sufficient for anything you're going to watch or play on your tv, and it uses less energy than the 240hz TVs. Not to mention the 240hz TVs will cost you more money.For gaming I simply put the TV in gaming mode, and it does a fantastic job. I have not personally tested gaming lag on it, as I do not have the programs required to do so, but from what I've read on other sites the lag in game mode is only about 30ms. That refers to the amount of time it takes for the image on the screen to register what you told the gaming console to do via your controller.This TV has several useful apps. It also has a smart feature that allows you to calibrate the picture settings to fit your preference. The smart remote is pretty cool as well, and it was fun trying to figure out how to work it compared to a conventional remote. One feature that I like is the smart share feature. I downloaded the LG smart share program onto my laptop for free, and it allows me to access movies, pictures, and files from my TV that are on my laptop as long as I have the smart share program running. I leave my laptop upstairs with the smart share program running in the background, then go downstairs and access various episodes of shows on the TV and watch them there.It has a sleek design with a thin bezel that makes it look high class. There is a little bit of reflection on the screen which can be seen when the room is bright, but it's not a big deal. Just make sure not to put the TV directly in front of windows where a lot of light will be coming in.Lastly, I just want to mention that this TV actually has pretty good sound. I purchased an LG sound bar to go with it, not knowing how the sound would be, and I really didn't need the sound bar. I kept it anyway, but the TV itself can get pretty loud. I was concerned because I own another LG TV that is five years old, and the sound is not very good on it, but this one is exceptional for an LED TV.All in all, a pretty good buy. I've had the TV for about five weeks and I don't have any complaints. When it arrived the box was in good condition, and there wasn't any damage to the TV at all. It was in perfect condition.

The magic remote was just okay for me, I actually ordered the LG universal remote for daily use.Now the bad, the TV would often display an 'Invalid Format' message when I tried to power it on with my satellite box.  We would turn it on and off a few times before it finally connected to the satellite box.  We have never experienced this issue with any of the other TVs in our home.In addition, the television screen would also go completely black for several seconds. A few weeks later the TV started to power off completely.I called LG to report the issues and a representative asked me to go through multiple trouble-shooting steps. Finally, LG  determined a service call was needed to further diagnose the issues. LG offered to schedule a technician to come out the next day, however I needed to make arrangements to be home and I asked if someone could come out 2 days later. I was also informed that I needed to show proof of purchase to ensure the TV wasn't older than a year. I was told I would receive a call the next day from the Service Rep to schedule an appointment.  Needless to say I never heard from the Service Rep and I had to go through the process of explaining the issues to LG Customer Service once again.  Finally, an appointment was scheduled with an authorized service center and I received a call from the service center the very next day.  The Service Center told me they were familiar with the reported issues and needed to order a part for the television.  The part came in approximately a week later and the technician came out to repair the TV.  After installing the part, the television still displayed the 'Invalid Format' message. The technician switched out the HDMI cables and then tried using component cables and nothing he did completely resolved the 'invalid format' message.The technician called LG and reported the issue and asked if there was a resolution. The technician was told the only resolution was to download a code that would also reset the TV to the original factory settings. After the code was downloaded, the issue was still unresolved.  I called LG myself while the technician was at my home and asked to speak with a manager. I was on hold for over 10 minutes before the call was disconnected.  I called back and once again I asked to speak with a manager. After approximately 20 min, I was connected with the LG Executive Dept.  I was asked to send in my proof of purchase so that my case could be escalated to the Defect Dept.  After sending in my proof of purchase, I received a phone call a few days later stating LG would buy back my television, however, I would need to return the TV with shipping labels provided by LG. I am now waiting on a refund from LG.", "Date": "May 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "LG makes the best TVs!!!!!", "Author": "Big Texas", "ReviewID": "R2Z24BF1K9RWAS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is awesome.

Although I had to make a hole in a wall and string cables from a cable box in another room, it was worth it.  I had just enough space to set up the TV near a small window.  Since the window is behind the TV (and partially blocked), there is no problem with glare during the daytime.  For some reason, it appears the TrueMotion tends to turn back on.  So I have to turn it off again.  The controls are very simple to use.  Some of the buttons on the remote don't do anything useful.  And I wish the cursor on the remote wouldn't go to sleep so quickly.  Fortunately, so far Netflix works very well with this TV and FIOS.  The picture and even the sound on this TV are really great.  Those are the reasons I went with this LG.  If deemed necessary, everything on the TV is easy to adjust.  The 3D is truly amazing.  I watched Vincent Price's House of Wax in 3D.  Now I know how those audiences in the 1950's must have felt.  So far, I haven't really tried the 2D to 3D conversion.

Picture quality is outstanding and the feature/function set is impressive, though this is our first smart tv so don't have a prior calibration.  Lots of stuff we haven't yet experimented with.  Works great for Amazon prime video streaming, youtube, etc., though it does seem prone to freezing up at times and reboot is required, even with the latest software update.  Much better online performance using a wired network connection vs. wireless as you'd expect.  Magic remote is pretty slick and works seamlessly with our comcast dvr box over HDMI once programmed.  CPU is maybe a bit slow resulting in longish boot times and some frustration navigating the menus at times.  Not a huge annoyance, though.  Another cool feature is the LG Smart TV app for your phone, which makes browsing Amazon, youtube, etc. much faster and easier, and gives you the ability to control direct video streams to the tv from your phone.  The 3D technology was not really a deciding factor in my purchase, however so far it seems to be very cool, to the extent you can stand wearing the 3D glasses.  Even  the 2D to 3D up conversion feature works well, though it's more novelty than practical, really.

Buying experience, delivery and setup were all flawless.  As someone already said, the picture was pretty incredible right out of the box.  Using composite hookups from my HD-DVR cable setup was easy enough.  A shame the cable company hasn't advanced to HDMI hook up.  My 3D bluray player was a simple connect, but I had to do a work around with my Bose system that only includes optical and digital audio possibilities.  Even worse, I cannot use the DVD player in the Bose system anymore because only sVHS output which this set does not include, The Bose system is pre- HDMI; guess it's time for an upgrade there.  Bose still works with the DVR and Bluray player so not a deal breaker.Was not overly impressed with the built in audio, so don't use it at all.  I couldn't resist fiddling  with all the video adjustments, which were very intuitive with live comparison of multiple possibilities, but in the end went back to the standard picture and have been very happy with how consistent it is.  Still cannot believe how good the 3D is.  I thought the display samples in the stores must be using some special feed that made it look so impressive, but every 3D Bluray I have tried looks amazing.Wifi setup was fast and easy. Amazon sent instructions that took me through the Amazon Prime video streaming setup which required a computer and passwords, but it was very easy to follow the steps and works well.  Netflix setup was even faster and easier and didn't require an additional computer.The remote takes some getting used to.  It's sometimes slow to respond, still haven't been able to figure out voice recognition which always gets me in a loop forcing me back through the wifi setup.  If it works no better than voice recognition in my car, I will not miss it.  I do love the fact that the remote is radio controlled (just like my Bose remote) so I can use the Bose remote to turn on everything at once.The smart aps screen is usually slow to load, but easy to navigate and sample.I am very pleased with my purchase.  Appearance, build quality of the TV and stand are much better than the five year old LG54\" in another room.  If this setup lasts as long as the 14 year old RCA 52\" Projection screen (that doubled as a computer monitor with SVGA hookups) it replaced, I will be very happy.

I like to milk the Amazon Warehouse deals and roll the dice with that.  This time was like last and the item arrived with a couple bumps and one minor bruise which I will explain later.The \"SmartTV\" portion of the TV is insane.  It will glitch out every once in a while but this thing isn't actually a computer so you should figure that you need to be patient.  All off the apps that you can get are amazing, the only downside is that if you want to manipulate that feature you have to create an account which can be a hassle.PICTURE:  ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!!!  It's easy to flip through the features and I'm no scientist so I like the fact that when you want to change the picture type it's point and shoot (literally)  Sports and video games are great, you just have to chose the right viewing mode.REMOTE:  This thing is so sweet, I can't believe they don't charge more for this.DESIGN:  Very sleek, nothing really else to say about that.  When it's on the border is super slim and when it's off it just looks like a black rectangle in the wall.DURABILITY:  This thing is not too durable.  VERY FRAGILE.  Seriously don't let anything touch the screen ever because even touching the border (as slim as it is) you can see the color fluctuation.OVERALL OPINION:  This TV is great.  I got the 47\" for my bedroom and I think that it will make a nice HDCP monitor/gaming display.COMPLAINT:  I don't have an antenna why is that the default when I turn the TV on?  Maybe a scientist can answer this for me.OK so about the bumps and bruise.  I watched UPS dudes drop this thing from the 2nd step of their truck.  It has a couple scratches on the top border and the top left hand corner now has 3 dead pixels.  I'm still not complaining because this thing is absolutely gorgeous and if I were to take dead pixels anywhere it would be in the corners so that when I'm watching a movie it doesn't matter anyway.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Really good, no real complaints", "Author": "C.

I honestly thought 3d was a joke after watching it on my Vizio. It is really good! The remote is ok, a little too simple if you ask me. I would rather have a few more buttons. Using the virtual remote on the TV is a little annoying. It just isn't very good at controlling my DISH or my Blu-ray. It works, but why torture yourself if you have access to the other remotes! The smart app feature is so-so. I certainly didn't buy it for the smart apps so it isn't something that impresses me. A lot of people talk about it being quick, but I didn't find it to be that quick. It wasn't any faster than my Vizio which is a few years old. The TV supports a lot of cool tech that is becoming more popular like NFC, WIDI, etc. but it doesn't have Bluetooth.

First, the most important part:  the picture is truly amazing. It's almost too good, as every imperfection on people's faces becomes apparent. But I wouldn't have it any other way. My last tv was 1080i and it is astounding how much better this picture is. The angle of useful viewing is also much better on this set. There is some motion artifact on football viewing, but I have not fully tinkered with the tru motion option yet. The set itself is nice to look at, with a very thin silver bezel around the edge. The stand is sturdy. I would caution those of you wanting to mount it up high, the power cord is s/w short.I do have a couple of small gripes which prevent me from giving it 4 stars. The owners manual is very weak. They do not explain any of the many options for customizing the picture, so I guess I will have to go online and research that, but that is 1 more step than I should have to take. The other is the lack of inputs and outputs on the back of the tv. There are 3 hdmi inputs but only 1 RCA. So if you have older peripheral equipment, like a wii and a dvd w/o hdmi, then you are out of luck and one of those peripherals can't be hooked up as is. There is only 1 way to get audio out, and that is a digital optical out, so you'll need to buy a new cord if you don't have 1. The screen is kind of reflective, not so much by window light, but by lights on in the room. I can see a relection of my Xmas tree behind me, but it is actually not that distracting.

WRONG!  You never need them until you do!Here's my story:  I bought the TV about 4 months ago.  During that time it worked great and I had no complaints at all.  One day out of nothing it stopped working (for no apparent reason other than a defective panel).  4 months ago means you can't return it to Amazon, or any other dealer that you may have purchased it from!  Anyway, so I immediately called LG customer service, and fast-forward 1 month into the future and my TV is still not working; I'm still waiting for a resolution from the LG customer service department.So, why not buy this?  It's a game of probability.  Many will be very happy, but if you're one of the unlucky ones like me, mark my words:  You're in for a ride with the worst customer service department that I've ever dealt with in my entire life.Buying an LG device is like buying a lottery ticket of a lottery that you DO NOT want to win.

The colors are bright, the black is very dark and the images are crisp. I also very much like the thin bezel around the screen. The thin bezel caused this 55\" TV to take up slightly less space then my 5 year old 50\" Panasonic that it replaced.The software for the smart TV was very buggy when I first got it. It crashed out of windows, and continually re-prompted me for doing setup steps that I already completed. After I downloaded and installed the newest update firmware I stopped seeing these issues. I was happy to find the Netflix app ready to be used, but there is no Amazon video app. This is a major disappointment especially since it's posted as a product feature on the Amazon store page. Quote \"Access premium content providers like Amazon Instant Video...\" Thankfully I can still get it through my Playstation.The remote is a nice simple remote that fits quite nicely in your hand. It has an on screen pointer that works well. I feel like I have to do a lot of clicks just to change the video input though. Unfortunately it will not work with the Playstation 3, so it's not quite a universal remote in that sense. Additionally it also doesn't play well with the Tivo HD. It recognized Tivo as a device that it supports, and the setup was very easy, but it poor at controlling the Tivo. It doesn't navigate well through the Tivo menus at all. Pressing the same button will often give different results. For example, pressing down will go up the first time, then maybe go down the second time, and pressing up will never go up on a menu.I gave the TV 4 stars because it really does have a nice picture. It's all the smart software and the remote that I have run into issues with. If software update support continues (including the addition of an Amazon app) then this will be a truly great 5 star TV.

After 40 minutes of troubleshooting (the person I spoke with was very nice and generally wanted to get the problem solved) which mainly consisted of resetting the TV to the default settings and then power cycling it and my router the tech went to his supervisor. He returned and told me something that still makes me a bit irate \"This is a known issue with the firmware and will be addressed in the next update, I can sign you up to get a phone call when the update rolls out\". Seriously. This is a known issue? I just dropped hundreds of dollars on a Smart TV that can't access it's own app mall and spent 40 minutes trying to power cycle through a known firmware issue? Okay whatever, it's not that big a deal I can still stream the premium apps and my network.Fast forward 2 months and there's a firmware update, don't get the notification I was 'all signed up for' and guess what, new firmware update still does not address the issue and it disconnects with a 404.I can understand working through bugs in the firmware but releasing a new major version (mind you this was going from 3.0.X to 4.0.X) and you don't repair a \"known issue\" that prevents access to the app store on a smart TV that is advertised as having an app store? That's ridiculous and I wish I bought a Samsung.Other than that it's great though. 3D is nice, the conversion from 2D works well, smart remote takes a bit of getting used to but is definitely quick, streaming from a DLNA server is a breeze.", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "agree with pathetic customer service", "Author": "John B.", "ReviewID": "R1UTO32LVPEJ6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Initial picture was outstanding, but had a pixel drop out in one corner.

Everyone I have talked to says thats why there is a setting called true-motion it doesn't work action movies or sports is chopy.Ok after more investigating the True-motion is supposed to control the screen smoothness but come to find out this models processor is not powerful enough to display a good picture on regular TV. Have not tried yet but they say gaming is terrible because of this. Very disappointed, they make it sound like your getting a movie theater at home but then you get it and it's nowhere near it.

The picture and sound quality of the TV are excellent.  It is a fantastic dumb TV. Because as I outline below the smart features are not ready for prime time I have only rated it at 2 stars. The smart features are extremely frustrating and often worthless.  The user's guide that comes with the TV explains very little about the smart TV operation.  I had to call support to find out basic operations.  That is when I was told about the 217 page pdf file that can be downloaded.  It is not a very easy read.  The things you can do with the smart TV would be great if the software were not so buggy.  Calling LG support to try and solve the problem is a further excersize in frustration.  They have 24/7 support and minimum wait for a support person to come on the line.  Unfortunately the support people are not very knowledagable about the product.  The simplest questions result in them putting you on hold while they consult some one or something.  One minor example of the bugs and frustration was when I went to buy an application.  At the check out you are given a choice if you want to pay with a credit card or Paypal.  I chose Paypal.  It then asks for my Paypal login.  I entered the required information and submittes it.  Instead of allowing me into paypal it just recycled the entry form erasing my entries.  After repeating this process a couple of times I called paypal.  The paypal support representative said he had no knowledge of the LG system and I should call LG support which I did.  The LG support person after puting me on hold several times said the system only accepted Visa or Master card, not paypal. This despite their screen forms that say Paypal. It is often, but not always, very slow \"loading\" the smart module.  On my previous TV we used a Roku box to see Netflix wireless without ever having to reboot the router.  On two occasions I went to watch Netflix using the smart tv function.  Got an error message that I was not connected to the internet.  Called support,  They told me I had to reboot the router, a pain.  My wireless laptop had no trouble staying connected to the internet.  The magic remote that comes with the set has no numbers on it so it is quite cumbersome to use it with a cable box.  It has a button to bring up on the screen a virtual universal remote.  But if you want to cycle through your favorites it takes forever because when you hit the favorite button it just brings you to your next favorite channel and if that is not the one you want you have to go bring up the virtual remote again.  So it is much easier to use the universal remote that comes with the cable box.  Only problem is the universal remote that comes with the cable box can not bring up or operate on the smart TV screen so you need to keep both remotes handy.  I  should  mention there is an iphone app that allows you to use the smart functions on the TV.  The voice recognition on the smart remote stopped working.  To get it working I had to reboot the computer by unplugging and resetting all of the many settings, about a 10 minute activity. Last the several input connectors HDMI, USB  are on the back side of the TV 5 inches from the left edge.  If the TV is wall mounted, as mine is, it takes a child's hand to be small enough to reach in and insert a thumb memory stick. In summary while this TV has better picture and sound quality than previous TV, the reliability of the Roku box was better than this TV when using it wireless.  If I were to make this purchase again I would buy essentially the same TV but without the smart features, and use a Roku box to show Netflix", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "VERY GOOD", "Author": "Min-Heui Yoo", "ReviewID": "RRBMC5BYUWJHX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "VERY GOOD......................I LOVE IT........................VERY GOOD......................I LOVE IT........................VERY GOOD......................I LOVE IT........................VERY GOOD......................I LOVE IT A LOT..I CAN SEE UTUBE WITH THIS AND CAN CONTROL IT WITH MY CELL.

Specifically to the LG US website with files such as these - [...]Unfortunately, LG does not provide any option to disable this spying feature for some TVs such as mine.
