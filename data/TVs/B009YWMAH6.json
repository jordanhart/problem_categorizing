{"Reviews": [{"Title": "An excellent TV for the bedroom or den. Glorious picture quality, but poor sound.", "Author": "Joseph J.", "ReviewID": "RVEMPXI3H426F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:++ Gorgeously crisp, vibrant, and deep picture quality and color--definitively high-definition.*+ Excellent viewing angles.+ Easy to set up; self-explanatory (no fuss!)+ Surprisingly thin and lightCons:- Poor speakers; sub-mediocre.- NOT for gaming; refresh rate may be 60hz, but very obvious, distracting ghosting, especially during darker scenes.- LED-backlight bleeding in corners (very obvious when screen is darker).- Barebones menu options.*The TV by itself has really great picture, just as advertised for the \"Aquos\" branding, but I achieved truly stunning picture and color by hooking this baby up to my PC and tweaking the picture quality from my graphics card settings. Even without this luxury, however, the picture is still great--even better after tweaking the preset settings (e.g. \"dynamic\").I bought this when it was on sale, paying a grand total of a little over $400, which I feel is just under the perfect price for this product. The TV is solidly built and easy to set up (just need to screw in the stand). It was pleasantly light, and I was genuinely thrilled at how thin the TV is (it's just about as thick as my 24\" PC Monitor).BUT LET'S GET TO THE POINT--the real reason anyone buys an LCD TV: the picture quality. I am not disappointed. First thing I did was plug in my Playstation 3 and played Black Ops 2, which isn't exactly what I'd consider \"hi-def,\" but I was actually amazed at how the game looked--this TV somehow made the game look better than I remembered. I then popped in a Blu-Ray movie, and after tweaking the preset brightness/contract settings, was genuinely thrilled at how clean, clear, crisp the movie looked. The colors were poppingly vibrant, and the blacks were rich and deep. I had to nod in approval, and I can confidently say what this TV showed on screen was truly HD. (Of course, the picture got even better after hooking it up to my PC--please see note above).HOWEVER, while I consider the picture quality and screen size reason enough for the money I spent, there were a few other things that left me a bit sore for spending so much. First and foremost, the speakers on this TV are just about the worst I've ever come across. No matter how much I fussed with the treble/bass settings, the sound was sufficiently loud, but weedy at best. The lows and mids were essentially non-existent. I would almost claim that my iPad speaker produces better sound. I would suggest curing this with a decent pair of (real) speakers or a soundbar right away.Secondly, while the TV touts a 60hz refresh rate, there is obvious ghosting. There are after-images and blurring when there is fast movement, especially in darker scenes. While this doesn't necessarily inhibit gaming, it is distracting. Also, as far as I could tell, there was virtually no lag between pushing buttons and things happening on screen.Another bothersome niggle I found was that during dark scenes or when the screen is black, you can see the LED backlight bleeding through from the four corners. You will not notice at all during brighter scenes.Bottom line is that this is a very solid TV that is beautiful to look at--both on and off. The picture quality is crisp and gorgeous, and it is perfect for a small living room or bedroom. It is decent for gaming, and really, the only real problem with this thing is the pitiful speakers, which most people expect from LCD TVs, anyway.Edit 11-26-13:Found out that the backlight bleed in the corners is typical of IPS monitors--something to do with extending the viewing angles.", "Date": "March 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not as enthusiastic as previous reviewer but not returning it", "Author": "avg_customer", "ReviewID": "R3IUEUEWXMAK4X", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First of all I would like to thank the previous reviewer for the detailed report.  However, I am not as impressed with the picture and it is probably just a matter of preference.Pro:Cheap $315 at Buy Dig (but amazon wouldn't price match since it was their ebay store)Size: 39 inchUSB: music, picture, and video (it plays any video i can throw at it .avi, .wmv, .mp4) excellent3 HDMIIt workscons:skin tones weak even after alot of trial and error adjustmentviewing angle not greatgloss black frame not greatsound is very weak; like piezo electric speaker greeting card weak.In my opinion this TV suffers from the same problem as all LCD TVs.  Skin tones come out looking like a Giesha girl with way too much over glossed white powder.  I have not seen an LCD TV at any cost handle this problem excellently.  Conversely I have a Panasonic Viera Plasma as my main tv and it is far more \"watchable\".  So take this review with a grain of salt because i am definitely biased in favor of a Plasma over LCD.  I did buy this tv and I am not going to return it because the Pro's out weigh the cons.I messed with the color settings for about 8hours trying to get an acceptable balance.  Lessoned learned is disable the automatic back light adjustment because it will fight you on all of the other settings.  I am using Warm color as a starting point and played with the backlight/contrast/brightness to get a good picture.Sound is poor, there is no way around that but +20 on the bass and minus 20 on the treble will help to avoid sounding like a greeting card.As stated in the pros above, the USB capablity is outstanding.  It plays ever type of format i have tried and has good video control FF/RWD/Pause/Play capability with no lags.  Better than feeding it through my xbox and very good picture quality on .MP4 formats.  One system bug here although is that the \"User\" screen format does not work when playing USB video.  You can select User but the menu is diabled to allow user adjust to brightness, contrast, etc.  So you are limited to pre-set screen settings.  Still great picture.So summary: I did expect more from an \"Aquos\" series Sharp as far as a screen quality and I would have like to do a store side by side comparison to the Toshiba 39L22U, but very happy with the features and price.", "Date": "April 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good picture and build looks good", "Author": "ROBERT D ALLEN", "ReviewID": "R21E6N2LLIG7YD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am very happy with the picture quality. The only thing I am bit disappointed in is the sound quality, but I think I am spoiled by the 46\" Sharp Aquos I have which has much bigger speakers.

It definitely meets the basic needs.", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lookin' Sharp", "Author": "1Dub79", "ReviewID": "R31RUG6K5RTCJJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the longest time, I have been all caught up with brands, such as LG, Samsungs, and Sony. Of course, I have owned an LG and a Samsung. However, last week, I went to Best Buy for a pre-Black Friday sale. I had an intention of getting a 39-inch 1080p 60hz Insignia for one-hundred and sixty-nine bucks. However, they were sold out. I then saw a 39-inch Sharp Aquos for only three-hundred bucks. Though Sharp doesn\u2019t get the advertising that those other LCDs get, they\u2019ve been somewhat forgotten. However, the Sharp brand has been around a long time. I also remember when my mom had a Sharp tube, which lasted almost 20 years. With that being said, I figured I give the Sharp a try.PICTURE: The Aquos\u2019 box says LED, but it is STILL an LCD. The LED element is the emission of a bright, but energy-efficient light. For example, the Aquos has a various picture settings. Well, if the Dynamic setting is chosen, the screen has one of the brightest lights that I have ever seen. However, the light is not overwhelming to the point where settings have to be modified to turn the brightness down.I was told and proven that 1080p 120hz LCDs are top of the line. That made me somewhat skeptical of getting an LCD that was 1080p 60hz. I figured I was downgrading because I\u2019ve seen other LCDs with the same resolution and the picture was HORRIBLE. However, the picture of the Aquos rivals some of those so-called top brands, even with gaming on PS3 and watching DVDs and Blu-Rays. The vividness and the sharpness of the picture is the hallmark of the Aquos. Not to mention, the Aquos is ONLY one that I had to spend so little time modifying the picture settings. The settings are very satisfying right out of the box. Wow!SOUND: The sound of Aquos varies by owner preference. I believe the sound is very clear by default. I\u2019d say it is at least better than the sound of my LG LCD. However, the sound also depends on what picture setting is chosen. For example, I was playing my PS3 on the standard picture setting; the volume was low by default. However, I changed the picture setting to the gaming mode, and the volume was very loud. That\u2019s where the surround sound really kicked in.VERDICT: Considering the picture quality, size, and sound, the Aquos is definitely worth owning. Not to mention, Sharp is a good brand of television. If your reservation is name-brand, this is not a bad place to start. The LGs are fairly priced. The Samsung and ESPECIALLY the Sonys are overpriced. I assure you that the Sharp Aquos has just as good of a picture as those LCDs and less expensive.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "A good tv with one major problem", "Author": "mondosalvo", "ReviewID": "R1C2HYOBREX8RC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "To be honest, there's a lot to like about this television. The contrast options are really nice, the menu functionality is incredibly simple and the sharpness and depth of the picture is better than I'd expected for one in this price range. Also, despite some complaints I'd read, I think the native sound options are perfectly fine. HOWEVER, no matter how much you toy around with the color and tint levels and the advanced RGB settings, there's still a completely annoying violet/green hue underneath everything (and in some cases completely oversaturated greens on plantlife and other things in the same color range...BLINDING NEON GREEN!).So, can I live with it? Probably, if it doesn't drive me completely bonkers.", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV for the bedroom", "Author": "D23 \"..d\"", "ReviewID": "R1IKNWMWTNXT5S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV for my bedroom so i can hook up my PS3, Laptop, and Comcast box. The picture quality is pretty darn good right out of the box, but with a little more calibration it can be even more better. I use an external speakers right away because i have heard the speakers on this TV is a little tiny.PS3 looked very good on this, this TV is 60hz and i played a lot of games on it already and i did not notice any ghosting like one of the reviewers mentions here. Blu-Ray also looked very good, the color is very sharp and vivid. One thing tho, if you seat really close, you will see some grain/noise but that is only visible if you are sitting very very close to the tv. Like a foot away.One of the cool thing about this TV is that you can plug in your USB drive and play pretty much any movie file (mkv,avi,mp4,etc) I have a lot of HD movie that i can just watch from my USB drive, its a very cool feature.I did notice that the viewing angles are limited in this, hence why i said this is an excellent tv for the bedroom. I wouldn't recommend this tv if your planning to put it on a big living room due to the limited viewing angles. if you see it from a different angle, the color can be a little off so keep that in mind when you buy this TVOverall i really enjoyed this TV a lotit is a great deal, i got it for less that $300.", "Date": "June 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "false label, poor quality", "Author": "martin roman", "ReviewID": "R2M2M9DFF2O953", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this TV \"on sale\" at Best Buy,the box indicates 39\" LED TV. when I turned it on and reviewed the documentation I realized it is an LCD TV.
