It came on time and the box didn't even have any scratch marks on it.

Amazon's service is wonderful too.  The first one we received had a manufacturer's defect.  I called, they shipped a replacement right out.  Two days later I received a return authorization sticker to send the other one back and we never missed a beat.  The whole time they kept us informed via email with shipping status, etc.  I love the confidence of buying when it is shipped from and sold by Amazon.  Thanks!", "Date": "March 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Six good years with this TV, then disappointment", "Author": "Jill", "ReviewID": "RD3GZ10ICCRUC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought a KDL-26S2010 Sony Bravia 26\" TV just over six years ago. I loved the design, the picture and the sound.  No problem with it until a week ago when I lost the picture and the screen suddenly went black. I still had sound.  I took it into to be looked at, hoping it could be fixed as I felt very attached to it.  Nothing could be done unless I was prepared to pay over $700 for a new screen.  I feel very disappointed about this outcome and not sure I would buy a Sony TV again although I have always favored their products. Sad....", "Date": "March 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Brad Prescott \"A regular customer\"", "ReviewID": "R1TQGBSBWG8NWT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great screen, delivered no problems.

I believed the product will meet my expectations since it was more expensive than Samsung or LG.Anyways after using it for a monthI already have two dead pixels(both RED). And very frequently I get these white pixels which I need to press with a cotton swab so it turns back to normal.Save your money and go for another product!", "Date": "April 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Wall mount Amazon recommends is incompatible", "Author": "John Whisnant \"IT stack builder\"", "ReviewID": "RR9EMUZPDACI5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased from Amazon a Sony LCD TV model no. KSL-26S2010. On the checkout page was a recommendation to buy an ariculating Peerless LCD wall arm.  I though \"Great! Just what I need for the LCD and Amazon has already done the busy work of figuring out which wall mount goes with my model Sony.\"  Guess what, the wall mount DOES NOT GO WITH THE SONY I PURCHASED!!  I have called Peerless, and they told me that they have had a memo out for months to their distributors that the two are incompatible.  I am returning the wall mount - that is the easy part.  But now I have real doubt that it makes sense to 1) buy electronics from Amazon and 2) trust Amazon's 'go-together' recommendations.", "Date": "May 17, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000HGQK2O"}}
