{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great little TV", "Author": "S. Nellis \"Patent pragmatist\"", "ReviewID": "R2XOYRYFLH36QP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was tasked with getting a small TV to put in my parents' kitchen. After reading lots of online reviews and looking at some sets in local stores, I finally decided to take the leap with this unit even though there were complaints of sound quality and small viewing angles. I have several friends with larger Samsung LCDs and they all have been very satisfied, so I trusted the brand.I'm rather glad I did. This TV now sits on a counter between the main kitchen and the dining area, and while it's obviously not as clear from every angle as it is straight on, its horizontal viewing angle is at least as good as other LCDs I've seen and better than many. We don't really test the vertical viewing angle much since it's waist to chest height, but it seemed acceptable to me when I sat on the ground in front of it.I was only marginally concerned about the sound since they have the option of passing the audio through to the kitchen zone of their distributed audio system, but the speakers hold up well for what they are. Don't expect the same sound that comes out of the sound bar of a 42-62\" TV since these speakers are appreciably smaller, but they fill the fairly large kitchen/dining area just fine. Don't know if I got a great unit or it's just quieter in our place than other reviewers', but I don't see us having to turn it up much higher than 60 out of 100.Can't really comment on the overall picture quality as they're just running standard definition to it at this point, but the colors are great.Very much recommend this model to anyone looking for a small basic set.Pros- Good colors- Easy to set up- Price: got it for $221 shipped during a specialCons- Muting the sound on the unit doesn't mute the pass-through sound signalNeutral- Sound isn't as good as larger TVs, but this is to be expected with smaller speakers.", "Date": "November 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good little TV", "Author": "Benjamin Thomas \"Capt.

I have 2 other samsungs in the house a 32 for the bedroom and a 52inch for the theater room all have excellent pix. But as any Tv goes out of the box doesn't always mean perfect. All Tv's need a touch of calibration for correct flesh tones and contrast. The 19 inch samsung is no exception! After a slight warm up you will need to tone down the color saturation and adjust contrast and brightness. Back lighting is also an issue. ( Depends on the room). As for the sound yes it got no oomph and its tinny so go to the audio section of the tv and customize you audio. Turn up the bass, down on the 10k, and the mid range. You will have to adjust according to your taste. After this you should be very happy with your purchase.", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Bigger Screen Needed", "Author": "S.

All attachments are made in the rear so you won't see all those cords. I like that the manual buttons are on the side of the screen (right side with screen facing you). I do wish that this TV casing came in another color besides black or white. Maybe a silver? I bought the black and it looks better turned on than off. (But I suppose that's what it's made for.) Also, I like that this TV is energy star rated. You can save nearly $100 if you buy the TV as a customer return \"like new\" or \"new\" open box.

It looks good, is very slim and lightweight, and has all the connections you need in back (including a headphone jack).  The one drawback is the sound.  The speakers are in the back of the television, so all of the sound projects in the opposite direction.  Kind of a puzzler, but it definitely detracts from the viewing experience.  Sure, you can hook up a stereo system to it and plug some component speakers into it, but if a TV with good sound is what you're after, and you're not looking to use separate speakers, you're going to be disappointed.All in all, though, this is a good little TV that works like a charm!", "Date": "September 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "wwsmith", "Author": "William W.

Nevertheless, I spent ~25 more for the Samsung vs. some other brands I compared to (Vizio, etc.).  I've owned other Samsung LCD products (including 52\" 7 Series TV), and felt that the familiar menu system and confidence that Warranty Service/Repair will be easily handled should it ever be required.  I'm feeding this TV Timer Warner Cable (no box) in my finished base- directly in front of my treadmill.  Instead of spending $$$ on a wall mount, I bought a 3' x 8\" wall shelf at Lowe's that works perfect: the TV can still be adjusted using it's own stand, and I have room for the remote, etc.Although I'm satisfied with the purchase, there are some things that need to be considered.  Black Levels (always a challenge for LCD's) are clearly not as good as anyones old CRT: with the lights off in my basement, letterbox \"black\" bars are clearly lighter than other displays. Also, motion blur is apparent- especially on Standard Definition chanels with scrolling text (like ESPN).  As expected, all of the local HD channels look excellent.I feel that I knew what I was getting when I purchased this, and it hasn't come with any surprises.

First of all, I wanted to advise you that the aeshtetics of this LCD TV are beautiful, and the shiny piano black front facade and that blue glow at the bottom will look great with most kitchens. In addition, the form factor is very small in relation to the 19\" size of TV, and works great with a wall mount.The picture appears to be \"typical Samsung,\" but, unfortunately, the sound also appears to be \"typical Samsung.\" The former is a compliment, but the latter is definitely not a compliment. Another reviewer stated the sound is projected from the bottom of the set; I didn't check, but it sounds like it is being projected from a Campbell's soup can. I'm only half kidding, because the sound is actually okay at best (given its size) if you mess with the built in equalizer. For those of you that are unhappy with the volume of the preset sound packages, I would highly recommend the \"Custom\" and then messing with the equalizer to boost the volume.The Pros are that the picture is excellent, the set, itself, is very attractive, and the price is very reasonable from Amazon (with free shipping).

A very good value.  We have one in a bedroom and one in a home office.The picture is good but not as good as the Samsung LN19A450 which we also have but is no longer available.  I would have preferred the LN19A450 even though it was about $100 more.In summary these are a good value for the money but not for those who want the absolute best picture and sound in a small TV.", "Date": "October 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great gift item", "Author": "J.

[Disclaimer : The product I used was from a local store]Its stylish, and adds a lot of picture enrichment. If you love sports or action movies, try the game mode and you will notice a distinct difference. Quite impressive.This TV will not be a good fit in the living room, for one reason it is quite small, and also the bigger reason, the sound quality is very poor.If you are looking at a small room, I would say this is a good fit, but definitely not for the living room.Even if you are desperate to pick this one up, you may want to try the WHITE model, which is really cool to look at [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001U88P8K?ie=UTF8&tag;=tvrecommendations-20&linkCode;=as2&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B001U88P8K]", "Date": "October 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "AVOID ALL SAMSUNG TVs!", "Author": "T.

And to fix it would've cost almost as much as the TV itself. The people at Samsung were very unhelpful and occasionally rude as we pleaded our case. An internet search brought up hundreds of cases just like ours where internal problems break Samsung TVs but it's not anything the average person can repair safely. Yet, Samsung refuses to recall their defective products.

We purchased a new antenna and installed it on the roof of our garage, where the analog antenna had been.  The TV wasn't strong enough to bring in the one channel that the converter box has helped with.  We are not happy with the whole digital system.  The picture we do get with the new TV, converter box and antenna is very good; I also like the slim size for my kitchen counter. If I lived closer to the digital signal, I would have rated it a 5.
