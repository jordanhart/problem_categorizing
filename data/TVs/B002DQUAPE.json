Picked it up at SAMS Club for 578.00. This thing pretty much set itself up without too many commands from me. We have basic cable with what we thought were only a few channels available but, when we plugged the Vizio in, it automatically scanned for veiwable channels and now we have about 10 more channels than we had before. If your looking for a good looking, affordable, easy to use TV, this is it! The menus are pretty easy to use and actually make sense. Also, in most menus there is a reset option in case you get lost and can't remember what you changed. We also have the Bose 321 system with HDMI (wich looks amazing) and Roku (netflix) with HDMI and pretty soon the PS3 with HDMI. It just so happens there are 3 conveniantly placed HDMI inputs on the TV. Hands down, one of the best decisions I've made in a while", "Date": "October 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Beautiful picture, inexpensive TV", "Author": "R. M. Albistegui-DuBois", "ReviewID": "R1JPLL6J2NH02V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We decided to upgrade to an HDTV to prepare for using a Mac Mini as a media center (and drop the cable!) Of course, to make that work well, we needed a high-resolution display, so we decided to look only at 1080p-capable screens. Out living room is pretty small, so a 37\" seemed adequate.We were primarily looking at Samsung and Sony models, when my wife spotted this at Costco for under $600. I wasn't all that familiar with Vizio products, but I am a bit leery of smaller manufacturers. However, the picture looked good, and what I read gave me hope, so we went ahead and bought one.I'm very happy with it so far. It has a good suite of inputs: 3 HDMI (2 rear/1 side), 2 component (1 rear/1 side), 2 composite (1 rear/1 side), 1 S-video (rear), 1 cable/antenna (rear), and a VGA (rear). I've tried the HDMI, component, and composite inputs, and all of them display very nicely on the screen. We don't actually have the computer connected yet, so I can't confirm how well it works, but I suspect it will be just fine.We have most of the audio from our various devices going through a surround receiver, so I've only been using the TV speakers for the Wii. It's just a touch tinny--more than adequate, really, but not the same quality as the picture. However, since that's not a big issue for us, I don't hold it against the Vizio.A nice additional benefit is that it is quite energy-efficient for a non-LED backlight; it uses about 110 watts. The remote is well laid out, and the on-screen menus (input selection and picture adjustment) are perfectly acceptable. It's got a 60Hz refresh rate. I don't have a lot of experience with 120Hz displays, but we haven't had a lot of problem with motion artifact with this set.Highly recommended as a very nice TV for such a good price.", "Date": "February 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "GREAT TV, GREAT PRICE", "Author": "Steven Jacko", "ReviewID": "R1EPXCNOH17I0L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this tv about two weeks ago and i love it. the backlight and brightness control are outstanding way better than other similar brands.  the sound is good especially for a flat panel.  the picture quality is great. the menus are not as fancy as say a sony but at this price you cant complain.  this tv is also half the weight of most 32\" tvs i have seen.  i love it and would highly recommend purchasing.  plus it is made in the USA.", "Date": "August 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV at an affordable price", "Author": "John Evernham", "ReviewID": "R433HEYZM83S3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my Vizio at Walmart for 597.00 and its a great LCD,easy set up right out of the box,37 inch with plenty of options,we like it alot.

Only problem was that when it was received from Tiger Direct there was no remote, manual or power cord. Good news is that after contacting Vizio I had all 3 within a couple of Days.  Excellent service from Vizio with no hassle in taking care of the issue.  The customer rep was extremely nice and helpful.

Late December 2009, the picture wouldn't come on...it was scrunched at the top of the screen showing only 2 inches of picture.  The rest was white screen.  After leaving it on for an hour, the picture started to stretch out.  It took 2 hours to get the full picture back.  At least twice a month during 2010 we had to reset the tv because horizontal lines would take over the screen along with wide, horizontal, white stripes that blocked the image.  Reset involved turning the tv off and unplugging for an hour.  The suggested method in Vizio's manual didn't work (turning the tv off, unplugging, holding the power button in for 30 seconds).The tv is on a UPS that prevents surges and provides clean power so that is not the problem.  It doesn't matter which port we have the cable and dvd player coming into...All the ports have the same problem.Two weeks ago (mid-June 2011), the lines took over again followed by the wide, white, horizontal swatch that covered the bottom 2/3 of the screen.  Neither reset method worked.  The picture eventually became completely white with colored strings going across the screen top.We contacted Vizio and they told us that the tv was out of warranty so go find a repair person and pay to get it fixed.We checked to make sure there weren't any loose connections...no change.  We verified the power board was okay...no burnt marks, all capacitors were intact and healthy-looking, no dripage of liquid from the capacitors, etc.  After determining that the power board was okay, we broke down and purchased the video controller board and the CPU board from a third party to replace the boards inside the set.  $117.86 later, we still have the horizontal lines.In addition to the video display problems, the sound isn't that good.  It lacks depth and is tinny.We purchased this set because we found out that Vizio was an American company and we wanted to buy American.  HA!!!  It may be assembled in America but every single part inside the tv is labled as \"Made In China.\"  Do a search on the internet and you will find that this screen display problem is a common problem and the response from Vizio support is the same.  I found out yesterday that my nephew bought a new Vizio 1080p LCD HDTV as well a few years back.  Within a month of purchase, he had to have it repaired.  His repair person replaced the inside boards with LG boards.  This television is a piece of expensive junk.  Don't waste your money.  All you are in for is aggravation.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "37 inch Vizo Plasma TV", "Author": "NyBobby", "ReviewID": "R1E03WENSDWK8T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have 4 plasma's in my home and this one is unreal even on non HD channels.

I read some review where people complained about the sound but I have not had any issues at all.  Volume is good on all channels.  There is a delay when changing channels between HD channels, but that may be related to the Charter Cable HD box.  Not really a big deal anyway.  I like this has so many input options.

First, there was a low hum from both speakers even when the sound was on mute.  Second, there was a dotted flashing white line at the very top of the picture on all channels.  Since this was the exact same setup that I have had my current LCD tv in for the past 3 years (and it works just fine), I am sure it was not the connections, but, rather, a manufacturing defect in this set.If this had been working properly, I would have been very, very impressed with the picture quality.  The sound quality was nasal and tinny, though, even after I adjusted the built-in equalizer and fiddled with the sound settings.So, PROS:  GREAT picture, good size for a medium sized room (40\" is too big and 32\" too small in my living room).CONS: Terrible nasal sound quality, not the nicest remote to use (button placement does not make the most sense), and having the set defective out of the box does not inspire confidence in the quality of construction of the brand.", "Date": "December 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "\"Black screen of Death\"", "Author": "C.
