{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not the best smart TV around", "Author": "Phenomenon007 \"Scionbegone\"", "ReviewID": "R3EZZLQEWL0IFV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "One of the big features for the TV has to be the MediaConnect and DLNA.  The other features such as Netflix, Hulu, etc all work great, but I wouldn't count these as \"amazing\" features since you can get these with most BluRay players and Roku pretty easily.  Now, I have to say that MediaConnect and DLNA are a COMPLETE lost cause.  No matter what websites, forums, FAQs, etc. that I looked at NONE had a straight forward answer on how to get them to work.  Phillips customer service is non-existant as the majority of the time they recommend connecting your TV to the router directly or advising that your video is simply not supported by the codecs on the tv.  Once or twice you might get these features to work, but this supports the idea that it simply wasn't programmed correctly and only a sporadic chance will appear for you to stream something via your laptop or media server.  From what I have read the types of videos supported are very VERY limited when it comes to the DLNA.  It has support for more videos if they are directly connected to the TV USB (for whatever reason) and even then only about 3-4 codecs become available.  The TV FELT like a good deal because of the extra features, but overall I did regret it because the extra features I paid for didn't really work.  I could of bought a 47 inch regular LED and then bought a Roku with all the working features.  I wish Phillips would have some sort of firmware update to fix all these issues and understand that their setup should not be so involved to have to configure a firewall or port forwarding.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "David E. Taylor", "ReviewID": "R2OU2N3B1RJC3X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this after researching many 39 - 42 inch sets. Picture quality is very good. Setup was easy. Netflix streaming via built in WiFi is great. I needed a TV that is relatively easy to move from place to place because I like to take the TV out to the screened-in porch to watch football. This TV is thin and light and very easy to move. I highly recommend.", "Date": "August 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Basic TV, Good Picture Quality, Easy Setup, Great Price,  But Lacks Certain Cable Inputs.", "Author": "Anthony Accordino", "ReviewID": "RIO6IBKCLGTDI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this TV, during the holiday's to replace my old basement dinosaur 32\" Toshiba tube TV.  I'm basically using this TV for my son's gaming, and to watch sports in the man cave.  The picture quality is exceptional, the set-up a breeze, and as far as I can see for the price[  I paid $330 on sale at Target ],  this TV is a best-buy in the category of basic 40\" TV'S.  Having said that, be aware, that if you are looking to hook up lots of audio, you may have a problem.  There is no optical cable hook-up, and the analog inputs are limited.  There are 3 HDMI inputs.  Wanted to hook-up a Zvox sound bar and was a tad disappointed to find out that no optical inlet existed.  I don't use WI-FI, with any TV, so i can't comment on that, but the TV is a Wi-Fi ready TV and can accept the internet, which is a nice option for the price.  If You are looking for a basic secondary TV for the household, this Philips 40\" HD  LED, is a great value, with good picture quality, that will more than suffice without breaking the household budget.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worse purchase I have ever made", "Author": "Omid from San diego", "ReviewID": "R3AEGDR2EPC62N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The tv is amazing but after we turn if off , it makes these clicking noise like its trying to cool off.That's how my grandmothers tv was and that was a CRT 1990s tv.This TV was for our bedroom and now it's keeping us awake for about 60 to 90 min due to the cracking noise , big mistake", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$537.98", "Features": "Brilliant LED images with low power consumption\nOne button access to wireless NetTV services on your TV\nConnect a PC or MAC to a TV wirelessly with WirelessConnect\nEnjoy rich sound and clear dialog with SRS TruSurround HD\nSmart Cloud for automatic updates to content", "Name": "Philips 40PFL4908/F7 40-Inch 60Hz LED TV (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/310Z-9pa4SL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BQ8RFPI"}}
