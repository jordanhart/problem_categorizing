Robinson", "ReviewID": "R1Y29G8FLVVEUD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Unless I am missing something I don't understand why this TV is being advertised as a smart/3d tv because it's neither. I am so disappointed and frustrated because it would have been perfect for my son's room.  He has been asking me for a 3d tv for a couple of years now for Christmas and I finally found one that I thought was ideal. Amazon please change the description on this item or explain to be what makes it a smart or 3d tv since it's not listed on the box. Furthermore, after thinking I was crazy I goggled this item on other sites to find that 3d/smart isn't even mentioned in their description. It's being advertised as a LED television....that's it!!!!!PS...I am giving it 3 stars because it seems like it would have been a nice set if that's what I was in the market for!", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$379.00", "Features": "1080/24P Signal Input for film frames just as theater\nHDMI terminal for simple connection with AV equipment Analogue image quality improvement\nHigh sensitivity tuner Low power consumption of industry-leading class", "Name": "Sharp LC32LE240M 32-Inch 1080p 3D LED TV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21LfSkvk-FL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00A8E1FUM"}}
