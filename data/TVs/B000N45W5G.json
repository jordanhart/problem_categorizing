{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Digital Display, Digital Price", "Author": "Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"", "ReviewID": "R2KRIE9YNESFNT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Right now in the electronics industry, many of us are going to have to purchase a brand new television. Although for a lot of us, we don't know why, but if we don't we can't watch our shows. In a couple of years, we will be watching televisions shows in High Definition. Although it might be expensive, there are inexpensive choices instead. Sylvania knows that feeling. With SDTV's, EDTV's, and HDTV's, in can be confusing. Not just that, it also can be very much a huge pinch from our wallets. Fortunately, you can buy one that is simple, with all the convience of your everyday needs, and this is one of those.The Sylvania LC200SL8 is a LCD 20 inch television that is inexpensive from the company, but convient in price. At nearly 15 pounds in weight, this television is sleek and easy to setup and works like a charm. It is easy to connect your video game systems like the Xbox 360, your DVD player, or your converter box for all your cable needs. You can also view HD programming at a smaller resoultion. Although to some it might be a hastle to some, it isn't much of a problem. It is very easy to operate and the display is absolutely beautiful on all your favorite movies and television shows. You can also view programs in 16x9 widescreen or the traditional 4x3 aspect ration with the new ATSC tuner. There is one disadvantage though, the instruction booklet could've been a bit easier to help those who have a hard time setting up televisions, but it isn't a big deal.All in all, if you get a DTV, digital television some time soon, I definitely recommend Sylvania a whole lot because they bring out a lot for anyone at a convient price. It is inexpensive and delivers well for anyone looking for a new television. This television is really worth it.Price: B+Convience: B 1/2-Easy To Operate: B 1/2+Sound: B+Overall: B 1/2+", "Date": "May 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "Light in weight but heavy in value.", "Author": "Bob Whitley \"Bob\"", "ReviewID": "RRDJHL5ZWYJYB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This lcd flat screen is the best tv i have ever owned and has the best picture i have ever seen on a non HD-TV.Even though this tv is not a HDTV it is EDTV(Enhanced definition)and has a very vivid,bright and colorful display that makes things on screen come to life in a way that a normal tv just can't do.Right out of the box this tv is already set up on its own stand so you can just put it on a flat surface and it's ready to go,you can also set this tv up on a wall mount if you want.The other nice thing about this is the fact that it can tune in digital tv signals as well as standard broadcasting,the digital tuner is going to be a must in the near future because over the air tv signals are all going to be digital.This tv also has the stuff you would expect to find like a couple of places to plug in your av jacks,a coax cable hook up and two speakers attached to the side of the tv for stereo sound.I love this tv and there is nothing bad i can say about it,it's great.", "Date": "August 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Bad pixle on the screen.  Poor customer support.", "Author": "Jeff Bradley \"Jeff\"", "ReviewID": "R2UEWV3OSAC69G", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "You may have a bad pixel on the screen if you purchased this set (Sylvania LC200SL8 20\" LCD TV). This appears as a bright dot of primary color (in my case a bright red dot about the size of a pencil dot) that is always on the screen regardless of what is playing. This is a bad LCD display that needs to be replaced to fix this problem. I bought two sets and noticed this problem on 4 out of 5 sets in three different stores in two different states. Only one of five sets did not have this problem. I bought this set for my brother I was visiting in another state as a gift. We went through three sets in two stores before we found one without this problem. When I bought this set for myself when I returned home, the first one new out-of-box had this problem. The second one did not but developed the problem within the first day of use. I called Sylvania's national customer support. They sounded very professional giving their name and badge number at the beginning of each call. They requested I fax them information and the receipt in attention to Fernando in their Warranty Service which I did. After not hearing anything, I called back and they said they received the fax and I should wait a week which I did. I then called back after a week with no one calling me and they said they would escalate this issue to their corporate office and someone will contact me within 2 days. After no one contacted me I called back and their customer service and they requested I start the process over from the beginning and if no one contacts me in a week, call back. I asked to speak to a supervisor who told me they would pay for the part but I would have to pay for labor. When I reminded them that their warranty covers both parts and labor, they said they would escalate this issue to their corporate office. I also let the supervisor know the authorized factory service center he suggested I take the TV set for repair after they provide me approval from their corporate office has an unsatisfactory rating by the local Better Business Bureau (BBB) from hundreds of customer complaints. Checking the local BBB is a good idea before you get anything repaired. After waiting a week without anyone calling me from Sylvania, I returned the set to the place I purchased it from for a refund and bought a Samsung LCD at another store. I was attracted to this Sylvania LCD TV set because it was on sale for $229. Even though it is only EDTV which is 640 x 480 resolution the value was good. The Samsung I purchased is full HDTV. This will allow me to watch shows in full HDTV. Within a few years most TV shows will be in HDTV and this was a better investment for the future.", "Date": "July 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "A great TV at a fair price!", "Author": "Poe the Ghost \"George\"", "ReviewID": "R2EQTUPTY7QCJQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I own this TV, and have never had a problem with it. It works well, was a HUGE upgrade from the old Apex 13\" SDTV (Standard definition) in my bedroom, and serves it's purpose as a lightweight, high(er) definition TV, with a larger screen quite well.I have never experienced a dead pixel in the screen or any serious problems with the unit itself.The only real downside is that if you have this TV up high, and try watching it while sitting on the floor the display appears darker than it actually is, which can be somewhat of a pain...However, this is a great TV at a great price, it works well for what I needed it for, now I can watch all my DVDs and video games at up to 525p Enhanced Definition, and the light weight of the unit made it less of a pain to get up the stairs.Pros: Enhanced Definition at low cost to you!Not all channels/games are yet using full 1080p HD, so this 525p EDTV works quite well with a Progressive scan DVD player or Sony Playstation 2 video game software, that can usually only display up to 480p anyway.Light weight (15 pound) design makes it easier on your back to carry it upstairs, downstairs, or even just lifting it up onto your TV stand.Flat panel design opens up a whole new world of placement options for you! Sit it on your TV stand, ontop of your bedroom dresser, or mount it on your wall like a picture frame.Built in ATSC & Digital QAM tuner! (So it'll still work in 2 years without need of a converter box)Composite, Component, S-Video, and Coax cable inputsMakes even basic cable look better!Includes intuitive, easy to use remote!Cons: The instuction manuel is poorly written and not very helpful when it comes to setting up your TV, (thankfully it's easy enough to setup on your own, and it's default setting are fine to begin with)TV screen is hard to see when you're sitting at a lower level than where the TV is placed.The buttons are placed on top of the TV instead of in front, so that can be a little disorienting at first.Overall: This is a great TV at a fair price, great as a replacement & an upgrade for a broken TV, ideal for game rooms, rec rooms, bedrooms, or even the living room.Overall rating: 4.5 Stars", "Date": "July 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great buy & Good Picture", "Author": "N.

The sound quality is good but not great. I use the TV's speakers as a center channel with my surround sound system. This would be a good TV for the kitchen or a childs bedroom but is a bit small for viewing across a large room. It has been reliable so far with no problems. The remote is too small and the buttons make little sense, buy a universal remote you'll be much happier. It is affordibly priced and has better picture quality than a standard TV (the color and clarity is great but not as good as HD) For the price it's a good value.", "Date": "October 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "sylvania review", "Author": "Gene L.

I already own a 32inch LCD HDTV which I use for my PS3 and my PC but playing my PS2 on it was pretty much impossible with most of my games due to the poor quality caused by playing standard definition games on a high definition display. While I was able to play my Wii on the 32inch it still suffered some quality loss which was a slight annoyance at times. I decided to invest in an older TV but I just didn't have the space to fit a CRT anywhere in the room since they're so bulky and I'm limited on space so I wasn't even sure how to go about finding a solution. I eventually came across this TV at a Goodwill for $60 and had never heard of an EDTV before so I did a quick read up on how they differ from CRT TVs and HDTVs. I couldn't find any solid info on how well they work with older game consoles but it was pretty thin (about 4 inches) and only had outputs for composite and component cables so I figured I'd just take the gamble.Luckily it paid off!After setting it up and adjusting the video settings I was stoked to see how well it worked. The PS2 and the Wii looked absolutely flawless using component cables. I got the same level of quality when I used composite cables for my PSone (I had tried it with the component first and it didn't take too well presumably because PSone games weren't made to handle that level of resolution.)The only thing I feel like I should note is the fact that certain (more specifically, newer) Wii games were made in a 16:9 widescreen format, while certain others still use the 4:3 standard format so you'll have to go into your options menu on the Wii and adjust your screen settings accordingly for each particular game. Otherwise the aspect ratio will look awkward. But it only takes two seconds to do so it's not a big deal. I can't stress enough how much it paid off. I went nuts replaying a lot of my old PS2 games that I'd been avoiding because I couldn't stand playing them on an HDTV. I gained a deeper appreciation for the detail on some of my Wii games that had been muddled before. Specifically, Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword and Xenoblade Chronicles. They looked alright on HDTV's but on this one they were just stunning.I never intended to use it for cable so I never tried it. It didn't come with the remote but I read that if you can find one there's features on it that will change the display of certain TV shows from standard to widescreen if they support high def. The sound quality is about average and gets the job done.I've had it for a few months now and it's holding up great. I had read on some other people's reviews that the TV suddenly stopped working on them. I bought mine used and it was in really good condition. I've been taking good care of it since I bought it as I do with all of my electronics so hopefully it will last forever and ever, haha. I think I'll actually cry if this TV were to ever break on me because I doubt I'll find another one like it and even the ones being sold on Amazon right now are extremely expensive and described as being in somewhat bad condition. I see they're starting at $250 as of April 2012 which I feel is pretty steep.But if you're looking for something to do some older gaming on and you happen across one of these TV's, by all means, grab it!", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic TV", "Author": "Justin S.
