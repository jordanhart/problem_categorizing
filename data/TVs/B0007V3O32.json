I might say I was lucky.... or for the price this litte LCD is worth the price paid...This LCD is filling 2 pairs of shoes very nicely...  It's used as a Kitchen TV and used as a computer monitor..  Very satisfied with the TV picture.. Very clear and sharp.. Great picture.. good back lighting, not dull or dim as some other LCD's I've seen...  Sound is OK but a little thin for my liking so I added some cheap amplified speakers which really helps..  Great as a computer monitor also..  Just as clear and functional as my high end HP monitor.. refreshes at 60HZ with no issues....  Would I buy again.. or another...  perhaps but I would test it out before the purchase if at all possible... as there are some bad apples in every bunch..  Overall my purchase of this LCD TV was a complete success for my needs..", "Date": "September 14, 2005"}, {"Title": "great flat panel lcd-tv", "Author": "Paul Maupin", "ReviewID": "R3OVA1DPJCJYFY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a dentist who uses these monitors as tv's for my patients to view while having dental procedure done.  I have been very happy with them.  There is a headphone jack, which I use for patients who don't want to hear the drilling.  I've only had them for about a month, but so far they have been great.", "Date": "October 16, 2005"}, {"Title": "nice little tv", "Author": "James", "ReviewID": "R2WSU95X8VN6MM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this tv for use in a computer room / kid's playroom and it works nicely.  I looked at several similar models and was drawn to this one for the price and picture quality.  I do have two complaints.  My Dish Network universal remote won't operate the tv.  When I called Dish Network they said that it couldn't be programmed.  My other complaint is the sound quality.  It is really bad.  I ended up buying some Bose computer speakers and they plugged right in.  A VAST improvement.  Overall, I am pleased with this purchase.", "Date": "March 11, 2006"}, {"Title": "Goes to Goodwill. (Don't throw out your old tv yet!)", "Author": "RENMIL", "ReviewID": "R2AP7BHIZHTEBR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have no clue what this little thing is about. Dummy me thought I bought a nice little tv, but it reminds me of those little cards you'd get with chewing gum and every time you moved it in your hand, the image changed. That's what you experience when you move around in the room and still want to follow a show. You cannot watch this thing with somebody else seated, say, 15 feet away from you. The other person (or you) gets a foggy image, or just dark shapes. Up close you see hardly anything.Buyers beware: this is not a working tv.One star for the batteries in the remote...", "Date": "September 9, 2005"}, {"Title": "Pretty Good - Okay if you don't need it to last long!", "Author": "eclecticmoon", "ReviewID": "RCZUK6UAUTURP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Perhaps i've been spoiled, but this lasted me under 4 years.
