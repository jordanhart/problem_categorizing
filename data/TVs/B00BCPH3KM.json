{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Incredible picture! With only 1 passable flaw.", "Author": "Aiden", "ReviewID": "R3DJE31B03MHOF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll keep this review simple. The TV is incredible with great picture and 16x9 movies with black bars standout ,making the black bars not noticeable. I came from a samsung 2 year old 50 inch to this 60. Its very noticeable the picture increase. The frame on the newer models (2013-F5500) is thinner, with more screen real estate vs more of a noticeable frame.Blacks are great! and Pure! Colors pop out even with reflections from light sources.Ill add some of the features which I had to dig for because the Samsung rep was not aware or hidden in the online manual. Im more of a feature person, started to notice Samsung online limited the technical information regarding their televisions.PRO:NO remote lag, quick menu transitioning.Built in Wireless N 2.4ghz and 5ghz.Streams 5.1 from Netflix, Amazon video, hulu plus etcClear speakers-I set mine to clear voice.Colors stand out even with ambient light cancelling out any reflections.Great TV from any angle.DARK Blacks , vibrant WHITES, and Greys blend in with black well, it also enhances the color and images because the TV has great black reproduction.(typical plasma)HDMI 1.4 (no internet pass threw) Samsung rep had no idea just said \"the newest standard\"  and wasn't listed in there online booklet.After some digging and verified at home, it is HDMI 1.4 just no internet pass threw.MHL connection from the side. (Mobile High def link) ie Roku stream sticks, Chrome Cast from google, and mobile devices. (it powers the item) Samsung site kept this information hidden. I had to dig for it. Future ready.NO HEAT. My 2 year old Samsung Plasma gave off a ton of heat. This one barely anything.Built in Wifi direct for Samsung products Galaxy Line and tablets or get a 3rd party app from Android play store . File transfer big files almost instantly.You phone/Tablet needs Wifi direct.Vibrant picture, deep blacks, and non-16x9 movies stand out to the point you no longer notice the black bars. 3D is okay, but I've only messed with a few games having it built in like Uncharted 3, Wipeout HD and its noticeable gaming layer. Have not tried a film with it.3D glass's use a battery watch , which last 150 hours, easy to replace. The batteries cost about $2. Replacement glasses are $17 comes with 2.Remote is easy to use, has a skip the main screen ability instead of going application to application. One quick swipe on a stand out bar in the track pad jumps to the next screen by passing the constant swiping.ie  pictures, movies, applications etc instead of going one by one on the screen.  Voice guidance you need to talk into the remote , not just into the TV. (my mistake lol). Has a setting to have all applications, including firmware auto download.Remote is bluetooth , so the signal is better than any television ive own that had , so far no dead spots.Very accurate even when sitting down.Thin frame, you notice the big picture screen real estate instantly coming from a 50 inch. Which had wider frames making the TV larger than what it actually was. On this TV is more of a pure picture experience.60 pounds without a stand and 66 with floor stand.As listed, Amazon video built in, Hulu PLUS, Netflix etcCONS:The screen reflects, so it takes a little getting use to. I adjusted after a few hours of watching the TV off in the living room. (The TV caught my attention since its in the same room as my PC) The trade off of such a good picture is 100% worth it and when its on, reflection go away since you have an image vs pure black screen. The reflection only kicks in when the television is off. Typical of a plasma set, but once you go plasma, its hard going to LCD/LED which have issues reproducing blacks and greys.Instruction for the 3D glass is clumsy. When the glasses are on, the screen LCD in the glasses turn on making them darker. (visual cue its on). When the TV set is on (the 3D) glasses auto turn off after they are synced to the set. To make sure its completely off. leave the TV 3D effect on and manually shut the glasses on while the 3D effect is on the screen. They give no indication its on or  off. No blinking light etc. By having a 3D image on the TV (3D mode) it gives you the chance to shut the glasses because the 3D effect will not work and the LCD lens on it lightens up. Even when glasses are off, the TV pops an image on the screen saying synced. Which can give an idea its on, instead of off. Its better to rely on the glasses to no longer giving you 3D as a cue its 100% powered off.No Wireless AC (new standard) Hopefully they will release an add on like a stick to be able to use the new speeds. Wireless N in 5ghz and 2.4 is excellent still . (id rather have all , plus wireless AC) This is newer tech , so its expected.---------------------------------------------------Those were my only annoyances with the sets.. which is really nothing compared to the befits the set gives you.3D is good, blacks are dark and has multiple adjustments to make them darker.I will not be using the TV for 3D but rarely. Mostly gaming, movies, Hulu plus etc. Gaming was excellent (typical plasma set with high refresh rate). Skype ready (you just need their $100 skype 720p camera add on.). You also need the camera for motion so it can track your hand movements. By default its on, but does not work because you need the Skype Camera.Streaming was solid. I ran mine in 5ghz wireless N. No stutter on 720p streams from Hulu Plus. I have not tried full HD 1080p streams. 5ghz Wireless N needs to be close to the unit. Not to far off because the signal is smaller. Typical, and not a Samsung defect.. all wireless 5ghz signals are limited to a smaller foot print..I am loving the TV. the duel core makes switching between apps, screens and transition smoother and the strong signal allows youtube, streaming content to work instantly and on button press.", "Date": "June 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV with a few small annoyances.", "Author": "A. Webster", "ReviewID": "RW2E0QTE9AAY4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace my pn58c500.  So my impressions are based off of the differences of these 2 models.  I also have a 46\" Samsung LCD in my bedroom to compare with.First impressions are WOW what a difference in picture quality.  I thought my pn58c500 had a good picture but this is way more cleaner and clearer overall.  Watched some of a Monster vs. Alien show on Netflix and it looked amazing.  Everything is clear and vibrant.  The sound seems fine to me.  I have it mounted on the wall at an angle, so maybe the speakers sound better that way.  The sound is robust, clear, and has decent surround depth to its output.  Now would it sound as good as the surround sound turned on and up, NO.  But I watch mostly at late night when everyone is sleeping and only use the surround sound on weekends.Now some of the annoyances are#1 - the remote is not very good, it only has a handful of buttons and most of the ones you need and want to use are buried in sub menus that you must use the touch pad to access.  Which is hit or miss on selecting the correct item(will probably take more time to figure out the sensitivity).  This is not for someone who has never used a smartphone or rarely uses a computer or mouse.  They would probably chuck the remote through the TV within 5 min of use.#2 - There isn't a power off button on the front of the display bezel(at least that I can find).  The buttons are on the back of the display.  My kids have learned to turn on the TV with the front buttons and then just turn on the xbox.  Helps with keeping track of the remote.  Especially now that it is so small and easy to misplace.Now some more points:- 2d-3d conversion seems pretty good.  I have been watching some regular netflix shows and playing some games(Battlefield 3 and Halo 4) and they all look decent in 3d.  Reminds me of the 3DS 3D output.- 3D seems good I can't really compare as this is my first home experience with 3D, I do seem to think it is something I won't use on a regular basis.- Input lag isn't a problem, I was going to get the Panasonic ST60 but saw that it was having input lag issues, so got this instead since I game alot on my TV.  No problems so far in COD:BO2, BF3, or Halo 4.- Wireless is built in, I have hooked it to my Wireless N network with no problems and have also used a wired connection.  No noticeable difference between the two.- I have no problem with it turning onto HDMI 1 when powering on, unlike previous reviews mine never starts in smart hub.- Reflection is no more than my previous TV and I have a large window directly to the right of the TV.- Motion and movement scenes are very clear and smooth- The smart hub when I first setup the TV wouldn't do anything, I had it wired into my router.  I could see all the apps names but no pictures for the apps and nothing would work.  I though something was wrong but it was just downloading everything, wish it would have given a notice so I didn't waste 15min trying to get netflix to open.- The xbox360 netflix app is alot better than the smart tv app, but if it is all that you have it will be ok.  One weird thing I have noticed is it seems that each app has its own settings and some can't be adjusted and some can't do 2d-3d conversion.Overall very pleased with my purchase, picture is great, sound is great.  I just wish the remote had more buttons for quick actions for example: a button to change picture size, picture mode, quick 3d menu, and they need to make remotes that have programmable buttons without buying another remote.Extended Impressions......July 14th 2013After some more time I figured I would add some more info.  The remote is absolutely terrible, from the awkward button placement to the size and shape.  I don't know how many times I have turned the power off when trying to adjust the volume.  I have very large hands so that may have something to do with it.  Also this remote gets lost on a daily basis and can seem to slip and slide down into the deepest abyss of your couch.  The sound now seems messed up almost like the speakers are blown because with any bass sound it comes out distorted and blown sounding.  Not sure if they are blown or not but need to call and have it looked at.  The screen seems to ghost almost immediately upon powering on, it goes away once the screen changes but just seems weird to ghost even after a couple of seconds of an image up on the screen.  I have not had problems with burn-in or IR.  I have taught the kids to use the Scrolling bars after every use of them playing Xbox.  Unlike my earlier review the TV now DOES start in smart hub every single time it powers on, very annoying and can't find any way to switch it directly to the input upon powering up.  I still find it annoying that each app has different picture settings and you can't adjust all the settings  for the apps pictures.I have gotten my phone to sync up and miracast or screenshare my LG Optimus G screen to my plasma.  My phone is rooted and this only works on 4.2.2 roms.  Screen and picture are still looking great and I don't notice the pentile display that some have mentioned unless I am standing right next to the screen, I almost think it makes the picture clearer when you are viewing at normal distance 10-15ft.  I also never use the 3D mode so can't really add any valued comments for that.  Overall still a great TV for the price, I am going to try one of the remote apps for my phone and see how that works.  For now I grabbed my old plasma remote and am using it since it has all the buttons on the remote that I want to use.", "Date": "May 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Overall, very satisfied", "Author": "Richard L. Wasserman", "ReviewID": "R2D2KRU5R6C01K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Updated 4/19For the price I paid, it's a steal.Day 1.The good - 1. Setup was super easy. - 2. The default settings on the TV had a very good picture. - 3. Black performance & 3D was very good. - 4. Speakers were tinny, but way better than decent - a big surprise.A few annoyances - 1. THE BASE IS NOT CHROME OR ALUMINUM. IT IS GRAPHITE PAINTED PLASTIC!  IT LOOKS CHEAP.  THE TV IS BLACK AND BASE IS GRAPHITE. NOT A FAN. - 2. as a small beep when you raised or lower the volume. - 3. I couldn't get the TV to burn in as it would shut off every few hours without activity. I thought I changed all that in the settings but it didn't work. Could be user error. - 4. When you turned on the TV, it would go directly into SmartHub. I am not going to use SmartHub much and would rather use my standard DirecTV remote. I cannot find a way to \"default\" it into HDMI1. An updated DTV remote code can fix this but you will have to flip the DirecTV Remote switch to TV, press Select, then move the DirecTV switch back to the box. Pretty annoying. If you buy a Harmony, you can program the remote to fix this. - 5. The remote is kind of weird. It was this multitouch old school laptop trackpad thing. I'm no sure if I like it yet.For ordering - I recommend 270 degree HDMI port savers.After a few days. - 1. I added a Samsung HW-E450C sound bar. It worked immediately with the TV.  Wireless connectivity (SoundShare) worked great. No discernible difference from optical to wireless.  It takes about 20 seconds for the wireless to kick in. - 2. After break in, the blacks were pretty impressive. Watched Van Helsing on blu-ray to test blacks and was very happy with the level of detail. - 3. I have witnessed only 1 distorted image in several viewing days. It lasted for only a split second. - 4. I am not a fan of the smart remote for changing channels. When using SmartHub, it's good. - 5. Like all plasmas, the screen is super reflective. Even in a mildly lit room, you will see the light source.

Possible updates to follow.  First, ordered from Amazon, delivery was prompt and safe, price was as good as anyone I could find.  Unit is well packed for shipping from Samsung.  I replaced a 50\" Samsung plasma with this set.Here are my first impressions.............PROS:-picture is bright, colors appear accurate, black levels seem good-set is lighter than the smaller set it replaced-build quality seems to be excellent-aesthetics (without the stand) of the tv are very nice-HDMI outputs run parallel with the wall instead of at a right angle to minimize \"stand out\" of cable-no motion blur at all so far-screen \"buzz\" is within acceptable levels to me-the apps section starts fast, and is fairly clean and intuitive-Netflix app looks very good, is stable, and has 5.1 out via the optical connection-I prefer the little control \"nub\" on the back of the bezel....saves the finger prints from the touch sensitive are of my old set-OTA ATSC tuner is on par with others-PiP looks very good-speakers sound ok.....previous reviewers had me dreading thisCONS:-screen is VERY reflective....all plasmas are, but this one more so than my last...NOT an issue 90% of the time-HDMI ports are too far \"inboard\" from the edge of the set....will make temporary connections difficult-A/V (component/composite), and antenna connections are right angle to the wall-the remote takes ALOT to get used to......most people will be glad to have a universal-no way to learn IR from the supplied remote as it is Bluetooth-too much emphasis is placed on the SmartTV functions, just give me a great picture!!-some of the apps are very poor-black levels don't make my jaw drop-no 2nd tuner for PiPMany of the features of this model will have very limited, if any use for me.  I could have picked up the step down model, the 5300 series, but I wanted to stay with the higher quality set.  3D, HDMI ARC, the \"OnTV\" functionality, PiP, wireless, 80% of the apps, the Bluetooth remote, will not get used enough by me really appreciate or give detailed info of.All in all...........I am still a fan of plasma, even with it's shortcomings as the picture quality is the ultimate driver for me.  I do wish that Samsung would have made a set with the PQ of the 8500 series without all the extras.....just give us a stripped down monitor panel with the best picture available......but I realize that I am in the minority here.Any major changes in opinion, operation, or issues will be updated.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "A great TV with some minor problems", "Author": "Bob Montgomery", "ReviewID": "R3Q7BR1L86KLGN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If you read the other reviews you will have everything you need to know.  The reflective nature of the set can be a problem and we ended up hanging up some new drapes to darken the room certain times of the day.  Some people hate the remote.  I love the remote.  If you get everything set up, and your TV starts at the \"Smart Hub\" as some have complained, the fix is simple.  Go through the setup menu and you will find a simple option to disable it if you so desire.  Many of the complaints are simply not becoming familiar with the options in the various menus.  After two months, I really am somewhat of an expert when it comes to setting up various options.  All and all, I feel it is a great set BUT.....and to me this is a BIG BUT, when you set up the Smart Features \"On TV Settings\" you may have a problem if you don't live in a large city with one of the big cable providers.  I have spent countless hours with Samsung trying to resolve this problem without any satisfaction at all.  When you go through the setup process, it asks you to select a service provider.  It asks you to enter your zip code to find the right provider.  After doing so, the setup gives you a list of the providers in your zip code area.  For me, it lists four and one is my provider (zip code 824114 TCT West Basin/Greybull IPTV ) .... when I select my provider it asks me to \"press the channel up or down buttons on your remote\" and asks \"did your set-top box change channel?)  This is repeated three times, each time the answer is \"no\" and finally it asks me to \"Search model Number\" which I do. This does not bring up anything to select and it then says in part ....\"if it's not on the list now, it will be available soon.  Please quit and set up later.\"  Two months later nothing has been fixed.  Samsungblames it on my (can you believe this) service provider.  Of course, my service provider is unable to resolve thiseven though they spent countless hours talking to Samsung on the phone.  The problem is NO ONE who knowshow to fix this problem at Samsung is available.  You can call corporate, you can call level two support, and allthey can do is read out of the instruction manual.  It pains me to say this, but at this point I know much moreabout the setup than Samsung support. One Samsung rep told me my STB  was not compatible with their\"universal\" remote but I proved him wrong.  Another option after you enter your zip code and the list of providerscomes up is \"My provider's not here.\"  If I select it the following message comes up....\"On TV window of SmartHub will not be displayed, since your service provider is not supported.\"  Remember, by service provider IS listedas supported.  Anyway, if I continue with the \"my service provider is not here\" I can enter my service provider as \"Entone\" (the name of my STB) and now the remote works with my STB 100%.  BUT the \"On TV\" window of theSmart Hub will not function.  If you don't mind paying for the Smart Functions, then you will have no problemswith this television.  If they work fine, if they don't fine.  But if you want all the features that you paid for you maynot get them.  And Samsung support is poor at best.  Three times I was told someone would call me back withintwo business days but it never happened. There is no way I can find to check and see if your cable provider willwork with the remote etc. before you buy this.  And no logic when dealing with Samsung..  Buyer beware.UPDATE 12-19-13. Nothing new from Samsung. My Cable provider sent their two top IT people to my house a week ago and so far they have no clue. The NetFlix app no longer works. I will keep this link up to date.1/21/14 Update:  I am lowering the rating because of the following:I too must downgrade this set.  The picture is great, until you facture in the reflective qualities of the screen.  I moved into a new home and the TV is facing away from the window, yet I still get reflections of lamps etc.  In short, unless you have a completely dark room you will notice reflections.  Sometimes it is quite bad.  Other times it is not that noticeable.  Another gripe.  Samsung ignores my pleas to fix the remote to work with my stb.  Some of the support knows less about this TV than I do.  I get remarks such as \"your sbt is not compatible with our remote.  Even though I have proved it is not true, and even though  they have my isp listed as supported,  they have not been of any help whatever getting my problem resolved.  I own a Galaxy 3 Tab 3 10.1, and it's software doesn't work properly, I Own a Galaxy S3 phone, and it's software doesn't work properly.  So I guess I expect too much from Samsung.  When this TV dies, I will be moving to another brand.  I will do my homework next time.  Oh, another thing, my isp (cable company) has spent hours trying to work with Samsung.  You would think Samsung would try to work with them, but no.  Nobody listens at Samsung.2/27/14 UPDATE:  I said \"Nobody listens at Samsung\"..... Google this.... \"do Samsung Smart TVs spy on us?\" You may be shocked at the results.  I am disabling most of the \"Smart Functions\" as a result.  Buyer beware.", "Date": "October 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great plasma for the price!", "Author": "Jason", "ReviewID": "R1EGOF6NLNJDBV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered my PN51F5500 on Tuesday June 18, and got it delivered by CEVA on Friday June 21. I went with Amazon for their return policy as well as the white glove service. Having to pay CA Tax, it was worth it as the white glove service else where can go upwards to $200.Delivery was top notch. The Samsung TV came inside it's own Samsung box, but delivered by CEVA, it came in another larger one. I'm not sure if this is how televisions are shipped to begin with, but it provided me a good sense comfort knowing that my TV was not damaged during travel. The CEVA delivered my TV on the second floor, and set it up rather quickly. They knew what they were doing, and the television was flawless.Onto the plasma. I'm not a videophile. My other television is a Vizio LCD M420SL which is at least 4-5 years old. I went back and forth between LED and Plasma and made my decision to go with the plasma after everyone's ordeal with light bleed & faulty units. So what can I say about this plasma? I LOVE IT! Picture quality is top notch. In SD, you really can't appreciate it, but in HD, it's a gem! I've watched Netflix non stop on this, and everything is so crisp and clean. Blacks are black, colors are not over saturated, no light bleed, and everything is even.Features:1. The swivel stand is a plus as I can move it around while I am on the computer and still watch TV, and then move it back to face my bed.2. The SMART remote is also great to use. If you are technologically hip, it shouldn't be a problem to use. You can draw channel numbers to switch channels, swiping back and forth is a breeze. Voice control is also simplistic. This should be the new standard.3. The 3D feature is cool, but I really haven't used it. I find 3D not a necessity, but more a plus to have just because it's standard feature. TONS of smart apps, and the dual core processor is quick enough.4. Plenty of Net Apps for you to mess around with (Netflix, HULU, Amazon, NBA TV, MLB, etc.)Gripes:1. Sound comes downward from the television, and isn't forward facing like my LCD. It isn't BAD, but I wouldn't say it's great. Volume just needs to be up a bit depending on what you are watching.2. This is really dependent on the person, but yes, this screen is REFLECTIVE. Understand this before you buy. If you put the television around a lot of light, you'll see it.

Be aware that only one remote, the touchpad one, comes with this TV. It's pretty cool, but I can see how some people would get frustrated with it.  Also, for anyone else debating about this TV, check out a video review on youtube by Rowan on the model PS60F5500(it's the UK version).  His review encouraged me, and I'm glad it did! You can't find a better TV at this price and if you already like Smart Hub, then you'll be very happy.

The older Samsung couldn't play m2ts files (from a bluray structured folder) via usb on portable HHD, but this model can.Lastly, a lot of complaints about CEVA enhanced delivery, but they were just fine.  I had \"scheduled delivery\", but they nonetheless called ahead of time to reconfirm, came on time, and they even put the TV on the stand.  No complaints whatsoever.  UPDATE:After a few days, the TV developed a power issue. This is exactly what happened, so if this happens to you you know what to do. I will try to be as detailed as possible because half-baked explanations do nothing more than make things more confusing.DAY 1:  In the middle of a movie (was watching cable), the screen went black WITHOUT SOUND, and the red LED light at the bottom left corner of the TV was off, so it looked like the TV wasn't getting any power even though the power cord was plugged into the wall. I know to look at the red LED light because that's how Samsung TVs are. The red LED is on if the TV is plugged in but not turned on. The red LED goes off ONLY if either (i) the TV is unplugged or (ii) the TV is on. It's a good feature because you can always check if the TV is off by looking for the red LED light, especially in the dark.After a few seconds, however, the screen came back on WITH sound as if nothing happened. I also noticed a slight smell of burning plastic, but couldn't tell if it was coming from the TV.DAY 2:  The TV worked fine in the morning, but it wouldn't come on later in the day. Whenever I pushed the power button on my touch remote, the red LED light at the bottom left corner of the TV BLINKED a few times and stopped blinking and stayed on, but the TV wouldn't come on. So now I had a TV with the red LED light on (so there was \"some\" power coming to the TV), but a TV that I would not turn on. I plugged the TV into a different outlet, but then the red LED light wouldn't come on at all. It would only come on after a few minutes, but when I tried to turn the TV on, the red LED light BLINKED again a few times and the TV still wouldn't turn on.I checked to see if I was having power issues with my wall outlets - electrician came and checked - but the wall outlets were fine, i.e., good, steady power in the outlets without surge.  I worked with Amazon's tech support who was very helpful btw, tried all of the troubleshooting methods, but none worked. I called Samsung's tech support, who was also very helpful, but, after listening to my explanation, they said the TV needed to be looked at. They offered to send out a technician, but I told them I was returning the TV to Amazon.I just received a replacement from Amazon and will revert with an update if I experience any issues. If I don't update, then the TV is working fine - fingers crossed.I know Samsung had issues with their TVs in the past due to faulty capacitors, and they settled on a class action law suit.  But that was limited to select 2008 and pre-2008 models as far as the court documents go (which I checked).  The Samsung tech support rep said she never received any complaints about this model.  This model is a 2013 model btw, so perhaps it's because it's new.  And I haven't been able to find any power issues on the internet relating to recent Samsung models. Perhaps I got a dud.I do want to make something very clear, however. Amazon was very professional, Samsung was very professional, and I have not had any issues with CEVA (after 2 visits), the shipper that handles Amazon's TVs.Samsung has been my brand for many years. I've tried Sony, Panasonic, Toshiba, LG, etc. in the past, but I still find Samsung to be the best - top quality, best value. Perhaps it's because I always bought my Samsung in Korea, where the larger TVs are made in Korea. And I've NEVER had an issue with Samsung TVs before. I have one that I have been using for 10 years without an issue. And the PN63C7000 I bought 2 years ago is still one of the best TVs I've bought thus far.Hope this helps!  UPDATE 2:After 3 months, the image retension/\"burn-in\" image started.  I own 3 Samsung plasma TVs and know about plasma and potential burn-in issues and NEVER had an issue before.  From day one (about 3 months ago), I activated \"Auto Protection Time\" and \"Pixel shift\" to minimize the risk. And I know not to watch a program with a static image for a prolonged period of time and never did.  However, now I have image retension/\"burn-in\" that isn't going away. I tried the \"Scrolling\" function, but no help. I called Samsung several times, but all they say is \"not covered by warranty\".  Absolute non-sense.  Don't buy Samsung!

For me the difference between plasma and everything else is like night and day quite literally when it comes to blacks. After breaking my previous Samsung PN51D6500 plasma which this is replacing since i cracked the screen I was shopping around for something else and I couldn't even look at the LED TVs that are all the rage now for more than a few minutes, even with the brightness set to the lowest setting on most of them it was like staring at a lightbulb compared to the natural effortless comfortable viewing on Samsung plasma screens.Out of the box picture settings are exceptional with no tweaking, i noticed this on my previous Samsung plasma as well.SMART TV is hugely improved from first generation, tho you get slower performance on this model than on the top of the line one.3D Looks great.Doesn't burn in as easy as previous plasmas, good features to prevent this and to deal with residual images.The price!The Bad:The remote concept seems good but in practice it's annoying. It has a very sensitive touchpad the slightest butt press on your couch or even just while inattentively holding it in your hand will fast forward your content or rewind it. The remote and smart TV menu can control your cable box depending on provider (NEAT!), but the lack of number buttons quickly became too annoying to bother with. Finally the mute button is on the side of the remote, (where an iPhone style touchpad Lock switch would be better suited)This is a specific problem I had with HBO GO App, although i'm sure other apps have similar issues. HBO Go will on rare occasions crash or hang while playing something, the other night this happened when i had fallen asleep. Normally a safety timer on the tv shuts it off after you don't use the remote for a length of time but this does not kick in if the app hangs. I know because i woke up several hours later to a still image on the screen, luckily running the pattern removed the residual image quickly. Unfortunately i can't use this app while dozing off because i don't want to risk that happening again.Another issue i noticed with the same app was after a movie finishes sometimes the resolution of the whole screen will get distorted and stretched out so you can't use the smart tv menus at all and need to shut the tv and turn it back on to continue.The glare can be an issue if there's a lot of light, if at all possible place the tv with the back towards biggest window.", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "60\" Model is Pentile.", "Author": "Reala", "ReviewID": "R39W8NI2SV4X5H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Just an FYI, the 60\" model (60F5500) uses a pentile subpixel layout.

If you got a low lit room, plasma is the way to go.  The 3D looks spectacular.  The remote is a little odd and too small for a TV with so many options.  It has a touch-pad sensor, and I'm thinking with a lot of use, the touch-pad will get worn out.  Then you would need to purchase a new remote if they are still available in the future.  Also, I had to disable the goofy \"what's on\" menu.  Every time the TV is turned on, that thing would pop up.  The biggest problem I'm having is the sound.  The TV speakers are horrible. I have owned both TV's for 15 days now.  One of the TV's started distorting anything with a certain bass level -background music, explosions, etc.  The bass now sounds like thunder, and rumbles with distortion when it hits a certain bass frequency.  The only way to fix this is to turn down the eq levels between 100-300Hz, but then the sound becomes flat.  I guess the other way to fix it is go through a Home Theater System and don't use the TV speakers at all. By doing a google search for the problem, I have found that other Samsung TV's have this issue as well.  One explanation points to a fault in case design. The bass distortion is caused by a lack of insulation in the speaker cavity of the case.  So when it hits a certain frequency, it rattles something on the inside of the case. I always had the TV at a reasonable sound level, nothing that would cause a speaker to blow.  It's strange that it does it on just certain low frequencies.  If the speakers are that fragile, I'm really cautious to bring the other TV up to a enjoyable sound level.", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Recommended", "Author": "G.

Here are my impressions:The picture is very good. However, I can is definitely notice some buzzing when there are bright objects on the screen. For example, watching a day baseball game can causing buzzing. Disappointing and annoying, but not a deal breaker. The black levels are quite good and I haven't noticed any loss of detail in dark scenes. I also have not noticed any image retention.I have noticed some issues when the camera pans. Sometimes it can be almost dizzying. Perhaps I'm using some setting (or not using as the case may be) that is causing this. I never had this problem with my old plasma, so this is definitely a strike against this TV.The screen is reflective, but my last plasma and the CRT TV I had before that were reflective as well. I don't view the reflectivity as a problem. I only really notice reflections when the TV is off or it is showing a really dark scene.I'm not a 3D person, so I can't speak to its performance.The browser is just okay. It's slow, but it does work for most of the sites I've visited. One exception I've noticed was NBCSports.com. I could only access the mobile version of the site. Specifically I wanted to see if Live Extra (for English Premiere League soccer) would work. It did not. I'm not sure as this is specific to NBC's site or if other sites are similar. I haven't used it enough to find out. Hulu.com seems to work just fine (for those shows that are only available on the web as opposed to via the Hulu Plus app), if slowly. However, I haven't tried to actually play a video. The browser is nice to have, but I don't see me using it a whole lot.Speaking of apps, the app selection and performance is adequate. The apps I've used so far can be a bit sluggish (at times frustratingly slow), but they do work. I've primarily used Hulu Plus and HBO Go and have had no problems with either. It does take a while for Hulu to load, but once it does it works fine. I'm using a wired network connection, so I can't comment on the WiFi capabilities.The sound is fine. I can make out everything just fine even when I have the volume on a low setting.3 HDMI inputs is disappointing, but switches are cheap.The remote control is good in so far as it's small and you don't need to point is directly at the TV. I did find the lack of number buttons to be a negative. Also, the voice commands for the TV, while nice in theory, don't work. The voice command system is, quite frankly, terrible.

My 58\" Samsung was not a 3D, and did not even have Internet capabilities, so I do love the new features this one has. However there are a few complaints I have,  The picture is bright, crisp, and clear until you start watching something with a dark scene in it. On dark scenes, the picture will become very grainy! I have tried to manually adjust the Sharpness, Brightness, Contrast, Cell Light, Color, and Black Level settings with no avail. I even went as far as to get the calibration settings from a reputable electronics reviewer. But changing the calibration settings did not help either. Now of course it could be that I have just not found the perfect picture settings for this TV yet. Or it could be grainy due to the fact that Samsung has changed the sub pixel structure of this particular model TV, to something that is a known as a PenTile structure. But as of now I have been unable to tweak the grainy picture out. On to the sound. The speakers are on the back of the unit, so the sound goes backward. I have to turn the volume up to the halfway mark before I am able to even hear it. Then anytime a little bit of base starts to play, the speakers sound distorted, and blown! Not sure why this is happening, but I find it better to just keep the TV muted, and my Surround receiver on. Now to the remote. It is very strange an awkward, a bit heavy, and a bit useless. I find myself getting frustrated with it, and just using my old remote that came with my 58\" Samsung. It is also kind of strange that there is one lone toggle switch on the back of the unit, that controls the TV volume, channel changing, and menu options. Also, the screen on this unit is much more reflective, than the screen on my old set. So a bright room does not get along very well with this TV. On to some improvements this set does have over my old set. It puts out a lot less heat than my 2010 58\" plasma did. When you would even walk by the 58\" you would feel the heat coming off that baby, but the new 60\" plasma remains cool to the touch! Also even though the new set is bigger, it does not weigh as much as the 58\" does, and it also uses less power, than the old one did. Also the new set has thinner edges, a thinner back to it, and a voice control feature, which is cool. ****UPDATE**** I have had the TV for only 2 months now, and I have found out that BURN-IN is still a major problem with this set. By default when you turn this TV on, the Smart Hub will open up, and about 9 small windows will appear to show you, what TV programs are currently playing. I have never paid much attention to the Smart Hub, as soon as I powered the set on, I would exit out of the Smart Hub. After about a month of turning the TV on in the morning, the little windows of the Smart Hub managed to permanently Burn images of themselves in to the background of my screen!!! I have always kept my Burn- In controls \"The Pixel Shift\" set to the maximum settings at all times! So I'm just curious how could something burn into my screen from displaying it for about 5 seconds every morning, for about a month?? That makes no sense to me, but it happened! I contacted Samsung that sent a technician out, that verified that it was burn in, caused from the Smart Hub Windows, and Samsung DOES NOT cover Burn In. The Samsung Scrolling feature that is supposed to removes after images, I have used this feature every day for about a month now, and the images are still there! So just like the burn in controls themselves, the Scrolling feature is useless as well! After the burn in already occurred, Samsung advised me to disable the Smart Hub feature upon power up, which I was not even aware that this was even an option! I even thought that the Pixel Shift Feature that protected my screen was broken, but the technician that came out verified that the Pixel Shift Feature was operating, and set to to the max setting.

I bought a plasma tv for the picture quality and it's been a great upgrade from my previous 4 year old LED. I have a few cautionary points to make regarding the software and compatibility side of things. I don't claim to be any kind of tech genius but I'm fairly tech savy-- maybe there are some workarounds to these things, but they're not evident and caused some big headaches the first few weeks of owning this product. Having said that-- I gave it 4 stars for a reason-- it's still a great tv and I'm glad I got things resolved... eventually.1) While the \"smart TV\" features were compatible with my cable *company*, they weren't compatible with the preferred HD cable *box* of the cable company. I was finally able to get a compatible box but it was like pulling teeth and the cable company charged me $65 to switch it out. (That's a whole other story that obviously isn't Samsung's fault, but it's something to check out while making this purchase.) Supposedly Samsung is expanding support for additional boxes but they don't proactively tell you if a new model is supported; you just have to wait and check for updates.2) After I got the compatible box installed... It's kind of neat having the slick Samsung menu's that provide suggestions and allow for search but don't plan on this feature changing your life. The \"guide\" forces you to start from channel zero every time and scroll up to the channels you actually want to watch. (The HD channels are in the 600s so I'd have to do a lot of scrolling to get to those.) Luckily you can still use the cable company's menu system but then why did I buy a smart TV, right? Also, the voice search interface can be frustrating. Searching for \"college football\" will return a bunch of games that are on, but the menu can cut off which teams are playing.3) I still use my universal remote for most things because the samsung one doesn't have channel buttons. It seems like an easy fix to have a shortcut to favorite channels but I can't find that feature if it exists. You can \"draw\" the numbers on the touchscreen remote but that's a step backwards if you ask me.4) I have a soundbar that is a few years old and it works just fine with the bluray player, the PS3 and with the cable box. The TV apps that produce 5.1 sound don't sound right coming out of the soundbar. Supposedly the app developers (Netflix, Amaxon, HBO Go, etc.) are responsible for this, but it's just one more thing.Anyhoos-- like I said at the beginning-- it's a great tv and I'm glad I bought it. Just know that there might be some major headaches in getting it set up and it might have some compatibility issues with existing equipment. I was one or two hiccups away from returning it for a non-smart TV. Overall I'm glad I stuck with my choice to keep it...

It only gets worse with brighter scenes.I had a Samsung technician come out and this is what he told me:\"There have been a lot of buzzing complaints with this particular TV.\"\"The buzzing sound is normal.\"\"The buzzing cannot be fixed.\"He also told me that ALL plasma TV's buzz and if I were to exchange it I would get the same result.  Well guess what I did?  I exchanged it for a 65\" inch Panasonic (ST60) and there is ZERO buzz.  I can't even hear a buzz when I put my ear up to the TV.  So basically the Samsung tech is either incompetent or just lying to me so I don't return the TV.  However, I am very glad that I did return the TV because the buzzing was driving me crazy.In a nutshell, I could have lived with this TV if it didn't buzz but in the end I'm glad I returned it because the Panasonic ST60 is 100 times superior in every way.Save your money, time and frustration - buy Panasonic instead (and do it soon because they no longer manufacture plasma TV's).", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "One week review", "Author": "Timothy Keyser", "ReviewID": "R52L70P08RW9H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this tv for one week and want to give my initial impressions.Pros- The price.

I was not expecting 3D to be as good as it is. 3D affects look like they are popping out into my living room. My kids love the 3D affects! The smart hub and apps are definitely a plus.Cons- The screen is very reflective like a mirror. Fortunately i can control the lighting in my living room enough so that this is not as much of an issue. Sound is decent but not good enough for me.

Admittedly, the stand being made out of plastic is not the best, but I have no concerns about it's stability.  Plus, the fact that is swivels is great.  Being a newer plasma, the screen is very thin(about an inch) and gives off very little heat compared to older plasmas.The picture quality is great.  Everthing you'd expect from a high end plasma crisp textures, deep blacks, excellent refresh rate.  I have not had an opportunity to try out the 3D effect, but I will update once I do.  I read some gripes about the Pentile pixel arrangement and I can only notice the pixels if I stand about 3 ft away from the TV.  I don't see how anyone could notice as long as the TV is more than 5ft away.The Smart hub features are nice.  It comes with preinstalled with streaming apps like Netflix, Hulu plus, and Amazon Instant video.  All of which work well. I haven't tried youtube, facebook, or the internet browser.  Honestly, I would never use a TV for that.One last thing to note, this TV does have a fair amount of glare.  As with all plasmas, they perform best in lower light.  However, there is no anti-reflective coating as there is in some competing sets.  It just requires a bit more consideration as to its placement.Factoring in all of it's features and the price, it's an easy 5 star.

Maybe I have low standards but I see a bunch of complaints in the other reviews and they all seem very anal and silly. I mean the screen is made of glass so of course there will be a glare but how is that the TVs fault? Do these people blame their dryers for creating lint too? It does have a glare but only if you look at the glare and not the content that is showing on the TV at the time. Maybe I'm the only person that has the ability to completely ignore the glare and watch whats actually showing on the screen.As for the picture, what can i say, its stellar. My previous TV was a Sharp Aquos LCD 32 inch and its ok. It finally went caput so I upgraded to the Samsung PN60F5500 after doing a lot of research. I wanted to stay away from the big name TVs i.e. Sony, Samsung, Sharp, LG, etc because you pay more for the name than the product. But surprisingly this model has a lot of high priced features for a very good price so I bought it and it was the best decision I made this month.Those features include:- A dual core processor so it is very fast in processing commands, no sluggishness.- Anynet features which allows you to use one remote with all of your samsung comp[atible devices ie DVD player, Soundbar, etc.- Include IR extension sensor so you can use remotes from all over and far away.- voice command feature. It may seem gimmicky but like anything, if used correctly it can be extremely useful and convenient.- Built in wifi, goes without saying- Automatic updates, no downloaded onto a USB then sticking into the TV (huge PITB). This TV does it automatically while you make Breakfast, etc.- Swivel stand, i know this seems like a no brainer but you'd be surprised how many high-priced TVs does not have this feature. The TV can swivel from side to side (A helpful feature to those afraid of the dreaded glare I'm sure.)Needles to say my search for a great TV has ended.

Pandora, Tune In, and many more apps are available and enhance the TV's overall feature set.The only cons I can think of about this TV have more to do with the sound than the picture. The speakers are hidden behind the TV (probably why they can keep the bezel so small). This yields poor sound quality, but for most people, this won't matter because they will have an external sound system to provide the sound.Also, the only offered output for audio is optical, so you will need a converter if your amp doesn't have optical audio input.

Firstly, the 3D looks great and is pretty cool when you get some awesome content that you missed in the theater.  Secondly, and for me, more importantly:  I don't need my Roku 3 box or Apple TV box any more.  I mounted my TV on the wall and there's exactly ONE wire going into it, the power cord.  That's it.  My wife was floored (she resisted a larger TV, worried about wires, etc etc...) and loves the fact that she only has to use one remote.  Score.Anyway, love the smart tv section, and even cooler it just magically saw my Synology NAS on my network, so I now have all my video (and other media) content available from my home server.  Fantastic!  I still installed the Plex app because it allows better/faster skipping and remembers where I love off, but still... fantastic.Super happy I bought this, will likely buy another one for my man cave :-)Cons:Ok I had a major problem connecting to the Smart TV hub, even though I was connected to the internet, I had to eventually call product support (which amazingly didn't take forever, and was actually useful, and fixed my problem.  wild).

It will downconvert to 2.1  If you have an older receiver with no HDMI, this is not your TV.  Same goes for the all in one and soundbars that only have optical input.  The exception is if you are on netflix, apps, or using the in tv tuner.  Then, and only then, will you get 5.1/7.1 through the optical cable.  Due to this problem I had to buy a new Denon receiver to replace my old marantz.- the glare is really substantial, even compared to my older samsung plasma.  Mine is set up in a basement and even then I get glare.  This TV would be terrible in a room with lots of windows.  Make sure you are OK with this, before purchasing.- touchpad remote is worthless to use for any other components (ex: tivo).  I got a free BluRay with my purchase and it has a way better remote.  As an engineer I appreciate what they tried to do with the touchpad, but it just doesn't allow you to do basic things like fast forward your tivo.- the definition of blacks and dark colors was not as good as I was expecting.  Perhaps I need to get the settings better.  I feel like things get lost in the black.  Could be an issue if you're a gamer playing 1st person shooters and such.-  video from various sources and apps can sometimes be choppier than I expected.  Not sure why.my response to various reviews and their issues:-glare: yes this thing has glare.-I haven't tried a PS3 on this thing, in order to address lag.  I also never use the gaming mode.  I know you really have to dial the delay up to match audio with the video for dialogue.- The included speakers are adequate, but I added a Denon 2113 surround setup and it was a big improvement.  Who buys a $1200 TV but doesn't pay for sound components?- no i don't hear a buzz unless i'm 4 inches from the tv.

Bishop", "ReviewID": "R1RFPM5JLDXN63", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was my family's first big screen TV purchase, and our first plasma TV.  I bought this one based on a lot of research, both on websites and Consumer Reports.  We have 2 smaller (21\") LCD screens and one of my concerns was viewing angle.  Buying a big purchase like this without seeing it in person was a risk, but I feel I made an informed choice.The picture is large and clear, and the TV really has everything you can ask for in it.  We purchased a sound bar to go with it, but generally it does not need it.  We are using it because the sound from the bar is much deeper and surround sound, but the TV's audio is certainly adequate, and surprisingly good for such a thin TV.  Rather than buying a soundbar before you get the Tv, like I did, I would recommend getting the TV first and trying all the settings.  The clear voice setting is very good and adequate for most applications.  If you want booming sound from movies (and, if you are a XBone/PS4 player, your games) you may want the extra boost.  My son will not game without it, but he's spoiled =)  We've not used the 3D option yet so I cannot comment on it, but it's a nice extra, I guess.  3D tech does not seem to really be taking off so I'm not considering that a pro or a con on the TV.I'd like to address a few comments I've seen in other reviews about the stability.  The base looks small, and is plastic, not aluminum, however it is rather heavy and once the TV is attached to it very adequate as a base.  We have a 1yr old, so we were concerned about her moving it, but the entirety of the 45lbs of the TV seems very well supported on the base.  It appears to only turn left and right, not back and fro, which is perfect.  Because I am paranoid, I bought a support bar that goes on the back of this to firmly hold it to the entertainment center I have it on.Also, the remote takes some serious getting used to.  It is a very very limited remote, with most of the actions covered by the touch screen and voice.  The voice interaction is entertaining and novel but we do not use it much.  It's very much like using Siri or Ask Google.  The \"more\" button on the remote pulls up a menu on the bottom corner of the screen with all the other features of the remote you might be used to.  I like the remote, most of my family hates it.  It has built in universal compatibility, like most do these days, and has a decent amount of flexibility.  It easily interacted with my Comcast cable box.As a final side note, the TV itself talks to the box and uses it to populate its own menu which is quite impressive.  You can easily see a graphic view of what's on, or use the remote and get a list of specific items (\"what cartoons are on\").  On the menu there are also a large amount of pay-per-use and subscription services that you likely will want to remove from the quick access menu.Lastly, this TV was delivered as part of Amazon's Enhanced Delivery service, which I'd never heard of before but really appreciated once it happened.  The TV was delivered like you would get it from a normal electronic store, with a few guys bringing it in and at least partially setting it up.  As it was sub zero the day we got this, we did not do that, but it was still nice to have as an option.  They were timely, polite, and it really felt like I'd gotten the white-glove treatment.

There is an online manual which can be accessed using the TV, but it is cumbersome, and often refers to other manufacturers instructions, such as in regard to how to use screen mirroring, asking you to check your phone's capabilities without much other explanation as to how to make it work.  It would be nice if a better explanation of how to do things would be put in the paper manual you get with the TV.  In the slightly older days of just a few years ago, every switch, setting, function, and jack on a device was explained in detail in the manual.  Now it seems manufacturers just assume everyone knows how everything works.  That is great if you are a tech-savvy teenager, but the higher tech bears some explanation to those of us who know some but not all about things like this.

I've only had it set up, so I'm still getting used to a lot of the features it has, but most are pretty intuitive. My one complaint, like many others is the remote. A touch screen, without a full panel of buttons as well, is a pain. It is also very sensitive to touch. That's a minor issue though, as there are plenty of excellent universal remotes that don't cost an arm and a leg, and most of the important features can be controlled with your cable/satellite remote, or even a cheap universal remote.

Our previous TV had a great picture, or so we thought!We deciding on getting a new TV, it would be a choice of 4k or 3D. With the lack of  4k media, and an interest in 3D, I started doing my research. Everything I was reading was saying that Plasma was still much superior to LCD/LED for 3D presentation, and when it came to Plasma HDTV's, Samsung was consistently the leader in reviews.This 64\" screen was a perfect replacement for our previous 53\", both having approx. 32\" height, but the 64\" would be wider of course.The first 3D movie we watched was Gravity. WOW!!! Since then we've watch Avatar, John Carter and Journey 2: Mysterious Island. The quality was as good as being in the theater!!!

And now that the manufacturers are dwindling (just Samsung and LG left in the field) I wanted to grab one while I could.  Panasonic made the best but they've exited the market on these babies and that left me researching and deciding between Sammy And L.G.  Sammy won...L.G. lost by a wide margin.  But do your own homework and decide for yourself.  This one is a smart TV with the hub and all that...But I don't use it for that I mostly watch Blu-rays and 3D Blu-rays and it is a beautiful experience on this particular Samsung Television.  The price is good too...or was when I bought new ($797) delivered by prime (delivery wasn't as white glove as Amazon promises in my case...the wrong TV was delivered at first and I nearly didn't catch it because I wasn't expecting that..and the drivers never offered to take it out of the box or anything...so be glad you don't pay extra for the white glove delivery if you're prime...cause you may not get it.  And if you do pay for it I Wouldn't!!  The Television came very well packaged in the manufacturer's box shielding it from bumps and scrapes and the inner retail box was pristine when I opened it.  I've used it for thirty days or so and it's just great.  Set up is a  breeze and my son set up the hub and streaming part for me and said it was very intuitive.  He said the dual processor makes streaming and navigating a breeze but as I said I'll probably never use that anyway...well maybe Netflix if it's convenient...and I need to check and see if it has Amazon Prime come to think of it.  I may well have to update this review.At any rate I would highly recommend this model and so did Consumer Reports in it's size and price range if I can say that.  You can't beat plasma for the most vibrant picture out there especially in the blacks.  They've long since fixed all those weird problems you heard about at high altitudes when plasma first came out and even screen burn in isn't a problem anymore with automatic pixel adjustment and scroll bar rolling that's built into this model.  Download the manual from Samsung and bone up before it arrives and you'll be good to go in no time.One of the best large item purchases I've made from Amazon and aside from the delivery or extra service lack there-of...I had and have nothing to complain about.

She wanted LED(as did I at first) but after much research I found that Plasma can give more bang for the buck. I read a lot of reviews and although there were a couple of drawbacks, I felt I could live with them. When it arrived and I got it fired up I was blown away at the picture quality out of the box with no adjustments.What I expected vs What I got:Picture: I expected good. This TV gets good reviews for picture, but supposedly the better Samsung Plasma is much better. Blacker blacks and so on. Also being plasma, I was worried about reflections on the screen being a distraction. What I got is great. I am not a TV snob, but I am thoroughly impressed by the picture. The blacks are quite black enough for me and the reflection is not an issue, even though the TV is in a newly finished room that is still waiting on curtains (it is not directly opposite a window).Sound: Expected poor to moderate. I was ready to go out and buy a sound system to supplement based on the reviews. I am in no hurry now as the sound is more than adequate. If you want booming base, and true surround sound you will probably need a sound system, but I feel that the TV sound is pretty dang good.Remote: Expected poor. And honestly its not that great. I like the small remote, and it isn't bad...but could be better.3D: Expected 3D? But I was blown out of the water. Pacific Rim was our first 3D movie and although I did not have high hopes for the movie, it was really good in 3D. Actually not nearly as poor of a movie as I expected and it really showed off the 3D of the TV.Apps: Hate the Apps. Netflix works...And some of the others work OK, but I am sad that my Roku is now in my in-laws room. The Blu ray player is better for apps than the TV. Can't add many new. Can't easily edit the ones it has. I am not a huge fan. We don't have cable, just use Netflix, HBO, NBA League Pass, etc... and it is so much easier with the Roku.Overall though, for the money this is an amazing TV.", "Date": "March 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "5 stars for me!", "Author": "Charlie Tarkinson \"Charlie T\"", "ReviewID": "R3IKW3R9IF47XY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nice clear picture and good sound for the price.

The 70\" was a Vizio E series which I got for less than 1k.  Long story short, I returned the Vizio and \"upgraded\" to a Samsung LED 6300.  Turned out to be a POS and, considering that I've had no problems with my old Samsung plasma, why not get a new one?

I narrowed my choices down to several Samsung and Panasonic plasma TV's and went with this one.  I felt like this TV provided the most value overall.  Most of the Panasonic plasma TV's had better ratings when it came to picture quality but Samsung plasma's were a close second.  I felt like Samsung had the better features, such as app's, so that's what I went with.  I also liked to fact that I could link my Samsung Galaxy S3 with the TV electronically.  In general, I was looking for a TV with good picture quality, along with 3D and a \"smart\" TV with WIFI.  The Samsung PN60F5500 met all of the requirements.  I considered purchasing the PN60E5500, which is last year's model.  However, the price is almost the same so I figured I might as well go with the newer model.I've had to TV now for about a month and it meets all my expectations.  It was relatively easy to set up, the hardest part was getting it mounted to the wall.  It has 3 HDMI ports, so I used 1 for DirecTV box and 1 for the DVD player.  Another bonus is that I got the Samsung DVD Blueray player for free!  I'm not a picture expert but for me the picture  quality is excellent.  There may be a TV with better picture quality but I doubt if I would notice the difference.  The screen is reflective, but really hasn't been an issue for me.  I've only watched 1 3D movie, and it was actuallly quite good.  I've seen 3D movies in the movie theater before and the Samsung is comparable.

The Smart Hub feature works fine and the TV comes with many apps to choose from.  It's not as many apps as I have on my phone but it has the basics like Facebook, Youtube, etc.  It also has several movies apps but I've only used the Amazon app to watch movies so far.

So, here in 2014, i think its not relevant. The tv is set to turn off automatically so that defeats burn in.Beyond that,  i happened to see a large plasma displayed right next to a bigger LED tv at Costco.  Let me tell you that the difference in the plasma picture from the LED, blew my mind. This was in a brightly lit store. There was a forest scene, and the two TVs both had great images.  The LED showed the tree trunk and branches and the other colors of the screen were very good and what Ive been used to.  However, the plasma tv  went beyond anything the LED was capable of.  You could see all the markings on the trees; the lines and knots were vivid and the LED couldnt even display them.  Maybe a little thing, but not to me.I love the colors on this TV!  There is no stutter during intense fighting or chase scenes.. no jittery cgi glitches at allI probably could use some tech help to set everything to optimum, but i will get to it soon enough, i guess.The down sides are minimal and really just kind of my preference:the remote is too slippery.. lol  and seems top heavy not a natural fit. I have wood floors in our basement and when it drops (quite often!), the cover and batteries all spew out all over... Maybe offering a rubber bumper to fit would be a good idea for Samsung. Just sayin'...Another slight negative is trying to get a better sound from the speakers. They arent bad but I like to fill the room. If you have or can buy good audio system, fine. It should plug right in and be awesome.  I dont  have an extra one right now.  I tried hooking up a little 3.1 system that Ive used on several computers, but couldnt get anything to come out of the speakers except some rumble ( maybe 60Hz cycle hum or similar).

I've found this television to be PERFECT for that need.  I also have an 8000 series which I bought 3 years ago that I was hoping would work for gaming but the input lag on the higher-end televisions tend to be terrible for gaming, even when you activate GAME MODE.  I'd neglected to research this when I made that purchase.  Anyway, 3 years later problem solved.  So on to the television...Video quality is very good, though I wouldn't put it up against the 8000 series which can cost over twice as much.  Blacks are as black as can be, a hallmark of plasma television which was important to me.  Another hallmark of plasmas is that they are a little dimmer than other display types such as LED, LCD, etc.  I haven't found that to be the case with this one.  I use it in a room with a decent amount of natural light and have no problems with the brightness of this display.  In fact, in that respect it outperforms the more expensive set upstairs.Sound is a weakness on this television, though I've never really found a flat panel of any kind that sounds good given the smaller speaker sizes inherent to these types of displays.  I don't ever use the television speakers so it's not a factor for me, but I did try them out just to know what they'd sound like.  Pretty bad.  Oh well...As others have noted, the remote control is terrible.  Again, I don't really ever have to use it since I only use the display for gaming, but I did have to use it for initial setup and for calibration.  The touch input was a poor design choice.  It works okay, if not 100% accurate, but it never really feels right.  Even the buttons it does have don't ever feel the way normal remotes do.In conclusion, although this television does exactly what I wanted it to do for me perfectly, I reviewed it as average at 3 stars because the sound is really really bad, and the remote is a poor example of design.  If you want to use the SMART features of the television you'll need to use the remote and you will hate it every time.As a gaming display though (using external sound, headphones, etc), the size and quality of the display as well as its responsiveness make this a great deal at this price!", "Date": "April 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent value for the money", "Author": "David C.", "ReviewID": "R20X29M3AFTNNG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I almost did not purchase this TV because the reviews that I read said that the stand was not very stable.

O'BRYAN", "ReviewID": "RKVK1KLBX26CM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This set really does have phenomenally good picture quality, and is a real value, for the price.  The Smart features are also impressive, and the 3D quality is good too.  Sound is mediocre, as expected, but even a bit under-par by internal sound expectations.  Mine has no buzz, even close up, and runs very cool.The Achilles heel though is the reflectivity, which is incredibly high, by any standard.  Even exercising careful light control, in really dark scenes where the great black levels of plasma shine, you can often see yourself in the shadows, if there's _any_ light shining on you.  I found that very disappointing, but had to balance that off against the fact that (now) any plasma that does better will cost twice as much.Solutions to this dilemma are not simple:1)  turn off ALL the lights (works great for movies, but not how I want to watch TV shows, which is mostly what I bought this for)2)  special positioning.  e.g., over the fireplace mantle.  Normally I wouldn't consider this, but since you're then looking UP at the screen, the only reflection you'll see is the ceiling.3)  just live with it, and get used to seeing yourself lurking in the shadows.  Over time, this may not be as jarring, but will probably remain annoying.  Only time will tell.I have one other minor quibble, and that's with the Energy Star rating on this.  The yellow tag rating is $20/year, and while I'm sure this does use less electricity than almost any other 60\" plasma screen, I'm not buying that number.  If you back-calculate from the 178 kWh/yr at 5 hr/day, they're claiming the average power use when On is 97 watts.  I hooked up my Kill-a-watt, and the only time it was 97 watts was on a black screen with no Input, showing the moving central white box telling you to select another Source.  I wouldn't consider that anything close to 'average picture content'.With actual picture content, the Max was 295W (full white, as claimed), but (short-term) readings ranged from 140 on some shows, to 180 on others, and 220W on a few, depending on what type of TV show I had on.  I still need to do a longer term average, to see if it might clock in lower.  Since a full black screen is 50W though, I'm somewhat doubtful it will approach the 97W claimed.Anyway, in Summary the reflection was bad enough that I seriously considered just returning the set.  And if I had another viable plasma option, I probably would have.  Since I don't, I then had to decide whether I should dock a Star or not.  I'd call this a solid 4.5 stars, if I could.  But I like to be fair, and this was problematic for me.  I'm giving it 5-stars provisionally, because I think there are ways to mitigate the reflections that would satisfy many/most people.  It remains to be seen if I will be one of those, and I may adjust that later if I find it less than tolerable.  But I may decide to relocate this from the living room (sad face) to higher on the wall in the rec room downstairs.  I suspect it may work out quite well in that location.[I may come back and update this after I've had the set for more than a few weeks.

The speakers aren't bad as some would suggest either but i did upgrade to a Vizio 38\" sound bar with sub soofer. For $158 at Walmart it's probably the best bang for the buck out there confirmed by my reading and listening. Again, it's a lot different, and better, in your own house than a loud big-box store.  I've seen many LCD/LED tv's and i think i made the best purchase.

My main complaint (I only have 3) is that sometimes faces seem washed out. This seems to happen more often with news reporters on remote broadcasts. The faces are missing subtle details and this makes them look flat. I made some adjustments in the settings and it is better. The problem hasn't gone away but I notice it less now. Otherwise, colors and details are spectacular. I got it just before the Winter Olympics and I'm glad I did. 3D is fantastic. I watched Avatar in 3D and was blown away. The TV will convert 2D to 3D with surprisingly good results.  My second complaint is that the screen is very reflective. This doesn't concern me with regular TV watching. The reflection is easy to ignore, and this isn't a deal breaker. At night I have to adjust the room lighting to avoid glare on the screen, especially when I want optimal TV viewing, mostly for movies. The third complaint is with the remote. I like the touch screen generally, but it needs to do more. I reprogrammed an old Harmony remote that I forgot I had, and it works ok, but I still find myself juggling remotes with the TV, receiver box, and audio receiver. I like the smart TV features. I had Netflix already on Apple TV, so I haven't used it on the Samsung. I like that it has Amazon Prime. It has Hulu Plus, but I don't subscribe. The Samsung Apps aren't as extensive as I would like, but there are some gems there that offer some interesting video viewing. I really like that it has a web browser. It's a bit clunky and slow, but you can view web sites of your choosing. A wireless keyboard makes it easier than trying to use the on-screen keyboard.

But if it had cost several hundred dollars more like other TVs in it's class, I would have rated this only 1 star. Here's why...When I ordered this TV from Future Shop, I told everyone that it impressed me in the store, and reviews were mainly positive, but what worried me was that the price was \"too good to be true\". Turns out it was.This TV impressed me MUCH MORE in the store, where they were showing the special, ideal Samsung-approved content, than it did at home. Once at home I played \"typical\" content, I was disappointed. I tried various material, including both the 2D and 3D versions of Avatar, which is a very good-looking movie - normally considered good \"demo material\" for a new TV.Picture quality while watching video/film on this TV is actually pretty good, but anytime graphics or text are displayed, and even sometimes during bright scenes in a movie, there is a pronounced \"dotted\" or \"criss-cross\" effect on the screen (hard to describe). It is likely a result of the \"Pentile\" pixel matrix that this TV uses, which is controversial and some have complained about. Keep in mind I only sit 6 feet away from my TV, while most people sit 9-10 feet away. At 9-10 feet is's possible this wouldn't even be perceived. Anyway, this visual effect really bothered me about this TV.Something else worth mentioning... and this is likely one of the ways Samsung was able to price this TV so low... is that the build quality is terrible!! When I attached the stand (not an issue for some who wall-mount the TV), I found that the parts are all PLASTIC, not sturdy metal as would be expected on a TV this size. I was very careful to attach the stand properly but still, the TV actually LEANS a little. It is not even standing straight! It's only a slight lean (some wouldn't even notice) but it makes me nervous. I seriously fear that if someone were to throw a paper airplane at this TV, it might fall over! And plastic can snap - it's not strong like metal. Perhaps the TV is more sturdy than it seems, but the fact that it leans, combined with those cheap-looking plastic parts, worries me.Another way the poor build quality was apparent to me was when I was hooking up my HDMI cables. One went in smoothly. Another went in, but I had to work on it for a few seconds. The third, just wouldn't go in! I carefully looked at both the cable as well as the HDMI port on the TV, and both \"looked\" fine. This same cable plugs into other devices just fine. After about 3 minutes of careful wiggling, and finally a bit of force, I was finally able to connect it. NOT very encouraging, Samsung!! It should NOT take 3 minutes to plug in an HDMI cable!!!Finally onto the 3D performance. Well, the reason I had bought this TV was because I had just bought a Sony 60\" LED 3D TV, and was happy with everything except for the 3D picture (the Sony uses passive glasses, while this Samsung uses active glasses, which provide a sharper image than passive). In the store this TV looked phenominal in 3D, but again that was with the Samsung-approved content that wa showing on the TV, which is a very bright image, colourful, perfectly balanced contrast, etc. After trying out the 3D at home on this Samsung, I found the picture to be far too dim. During 2D viewing, I had previously noticed that the cell light (backlight) was only set at 12/20, so I went to increase it, and found that it was set at 20/20. Yes, apparently this TV automatically increases the cell light when displaying 3D content. That much is a good thing, as active-shutter 3D glasses are always prone to the \"dimming effect\". Unfortunately, even a setting of 20/20 on this TV is not adequate. I had read in other reviews that people complained about this issue, but I dismissed it since I was going to install it in a near-dark room with no windows. Well, as it turns out, this TV is not even adequate for my dark room setting! Another thing I found was that the cross-talk (ghosting) that sometimes happens with 3D was actually worse than the Sony TV was with it's passive glasses. When I viewed the 3D in the store on this Samsung, one thing I noticed was that there was no cross-talk at all. But again, that was the perfect, ideal Samsung video that was looping on the TV.One thing worth mentioning is that the 3D glasses for this Samsung TV (and I believe all 2013 models) are extremely lightweight. They are so light, in fact, that they could easily be mistaken for passive glasses (which have no electronics built in).So, I have decided to keep the Sony, even though it costs $800 more, and return this Samsung. But I am still rating this TV 3/5 stars because considering the price, it is pretty impressive. That of course is assuming that the TV isn't going to break down in a few months. The poor build quality is something worth noting, and deciding whether to take your chances or not.

The picture quality difference of a plasma vs. LCD was the biggest factor for me, and to get a PQ the same as this set would have cost me at least double getting an LCD TV. I jumped on the one of the last Amazon Warehouse Deals left before they were all gone, and I ended up paying right around $1K for it. It was well worth it and then some.Picture - While obviously not as good as the high end 8500 series or the VT/ZT series from Panasonic, I absolutely love watching sports/action movies on this samsung. Watching movies on this TV compared to my LED was like going from standard definition to high definition all over again. Great black levels, vibrant colors, no motion blur. Yes, the TV reflects during the day. After reading reviews on the TV, I knew to expect this. The TV is currently set up in a living room with quite a bit of natural light during the day. We just close the curtains and change to TV mode to standard or dynamic for daytime viewing. For me, it's a very small price to pay for a huge gain in picture quality. At night (most of our TV viewing), we set it to movie mode and can't get enough of it.Eventually it will be put in a basement and reflections will not be an issue.3D - I know a lot of people do not like 3D, and I understand why. For me, I really enjoy the viewing experience. I don't get headaches like a lot of people, and like to feel in the middle of a movie. Watching Avatar in 3D (not a great movie, but the 3D is the best I've seen) was just like being back in the theater. Also played Mortal Kombat in 3D, and the interactive backgrounds help you feel immersed in the game. TV came with 2 sets of 3D glasses, and we will be getting a few more for when family/friends are over.Smart Features - Can't give you an opinion on the smart features, but there's plenty of reviews on this already. I don't have any need for a smart TV, I use my PS3 for pretty much everything (gaming, Blu-Ray, 3D Blu Ray, Netflix, Amazon Instant, etc.) and all of those Apps work great. I will never use the smart features. If I needed them on a secondary TV I'd much rather buy a Roku/Apple TV/Amazon Fire as all of those are much more reliable than most apps on smart TV's anyways.Sound - Honestly haven't turned the TV speakers on. I haven't used TV speakers in years, and I can't stand the way flat screen tv speakers sound.I'm sad to see that Plasmas are being phased out, but glad I got a really good one before they're gone. I wanted a 60\" TV, with really good picture quality and 3D for under $1K. If I had the money to blow, I would have gotten a VT or ZT series from Panasonic, but for my price range this fits my needs perfectly. If you don't care about 3D and have a really really bright room this would not be a good choice. But for the money, the picture quality is outstanding, and that was my main concern in buying a new TV. 4K tv's are pointless with no 4K content available, and OLED are still way overpriced. This should hold me off for a few years until OLED tv's are much more reasonable in cost.***I know that this has a pentile display which has scared off some potential buyers, but unless you are 2 feet away from the screen you will not notice it at all.

In summary:  The 60 inch size is perfectly adequate for a 25x25 room with about half of that as a primary viewing area.  I use the optical output to feed a separate satellite sound system, which of course sounds great.  However, the singular purpose in selecting this TV was for image.  I found and used calibration settings from some of those technical articles.  I am not a digital imaging expert, I think the image quality is just great, and feedback from everyone else has been entirely positive.  Great sharpness, great dynamic range, and good deep blacks.  Fast action on the screen seems completely seamless and natural.  The nice new TV in the media room has had an unexpected benefit:  While we have been fans of going out to the movies, my wife and teen are now opting to catch most movies at home, sprawled on the big recliner sofa in comfortable to below-casual attire, where you can pause the action to take a break.  Given today's movie ticket prices (D-Box, 3-D, VIP) and prices for upscale food offerings, this TV may actually pay itself off  in a year or two!", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "bear", "ReviewID": "RVNO8FJBQPOP5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a buy after returning a higher end model.

I'm new to 3D and found this to be a good entry level set.What I liked about it includes the cost versus quality. The 'Smart' features on it are decent so I won't have to buy a roku box. It only weighs about 50 pounds (I have the 51\" model) so it is easy to pick up and move around or mount on the wall.Easier to focus on the negative though...Most of my picture/3D quality complaints are with the specific titles and aren't a fault of the TV. For example, some movies they will make it appear as though someone is in the foreground but that person's image will not be 3 dimensional. Some other movies do a much better job with that.Then what couple of minor legitimate complaints I do have with the TV. It is lacking in ports, I have yet to find how to connect a blue tooth headset to it, the touchpad on the remote would be better as typical buttons, and both pairs of 'universal' glasses I've tried don't work with it.My biggest complaint is that it makes a slight buzzing noise. Plasma TVs buzz a little because of how electricity is supplied to the screen. Samsung forums explain that as normal but only abnormal if the buzzing is loud enough to hear from 10 to 15 feet with the TV at normal volumes with a provided screen shot showing the volume set to 50. I found a distance calculator that I sort of agree with that says with a 51\" screen you should sit closer to 5 feet and my hearing is good (my wife might disagree with the comment about my hearing) so I don't usually turn the volume up passed 15.

It wasn't a big deal as the water didn't seem to damage the TV. However, later when I plugged it in, the damage was apparent. I think the TV could have been packaged better for more protection. The shipper should have also taken precautionary measures as well. In any case I called up Amazon to discuss replacement or refund and the process was quick and easy. They will ship out a new replacement at no extra cost and pick up the old one. I thought I would have to ship the broken TV back myself, cost of return shipping, and possibly even charged for the infamous \"restocking\" fee. This is my first expensive return with Amazon and I am pleased with the service. Gives me a bit more confidence in purchasing high priced products in the future.

That blacks are so black, it's as if the TV is off when you have a black screen.  I really like that.  That's one of the reason why I deiced to to with this unit.The other reason I went with this Samsung TV was for the hyped up SmartHub.  I expected the SmartHub to be at least as snappy/responsive as my 8 year old XBOX, however, not even close.  SmartHub and all it's functions (including all apps) are so sluggish, it is unusable.  I supposedly have a dual core processor, however, just navigating around the menu responds like a first generation android tablet.Voice commands are even more painful than navigating around the menu.  It's horribly sluggish and takes forever to show results.  On top of that, it usually doesn't properly recognize what I say.  You basically have to speak to it like you do your 90 year old deaf grandmother.  When you finally receive the results, it lists the standard def first, because they are usually the lower numbers on your cable box.  So you have to painfully scroll through the selections to get to HD.  I'm telling you, it is unusable.  Unfortunately, you cannot specify HD when you're making your voice commands.I have also ran across a few bugs in Smarthub.  Bug #1: If you use a voice command, then use your remote to make pick your selection, it gets confused, freezes and shuts down.  Bug #2: After you stream a movie from your computer and go back to live TV, there is a 2-3 second delay between video and audio.  Somehow streaming a movie causes a sync problem with live tv.  You have to shut the unit down and basically reboot.  There are a few other bugs, but I don't want to sound like I'm complaining...SmartHub learning my program preferences is either not implemented yet, or it just doesn't work.  I've had the TV for over  a month and I haven't had one (NOT ONE) program that fits my watching habits.  I'm not trying to be funny, but it seems to do the exact opposite.I've factory reset smarthub many times, deleted unnecessary apps, plug directly into my 60mbps modem, had tech support remotely navigate my unit......and nothing to work.  I avoid Smarthub at all costs.....however, today I signed up for a free 60 day trial of Hulu plus....I decided to go into the APPs section...tried to load the Hulu app and the app says 'critical error'  and complains that I haven't set the clock.  omgIn my opinion, first generation smarthub is much better than 2013.  They need to just keep it simple.Anyway, if you're looking for a great image and think you might want 3-D, this is a good TV.

It's mostly for afterwork viewing and watching Baseball.my very first impression was the screen itself has some glare, ok i can deal with that, so if you are to put this in a room with alot windows with alot of light coming in you may be dissapointed.I watched a base ball game last night the color is very good and the blacks are good.i was living on the edge here because i also Have a PN50C700 and whan watch a baseball game the static image made some bad IR on the C7000 and had to swipe the screen to clean it up. I must say there was not any noticable IR on the F5500, but i will keep an eye on that. My PN60E8000 i have never had a lick of IR problems so i'm hoping the same will be the case here with the f5500There are three picture modes Dynamic Standard and Movie I like the movie mode myself, out of the box these are not the greatest settings standard was dark but i upped the cell from 12 to 13 and it brightened up, I went to Movie mode and it was fine but still needed some tweeks i think it's got alot to do with source you know what talking about you know your on one station the picture looks great you change the channel and wonder what happened to the color that why IMHO you need a good calibration the the picture is what it is and your not chasing color every time you change channel.I will update after a good breakin period.The set up was quite simple, the only bug I got and that may have been me! at first there wasn't any apps in the smart hub after a little while trying to figure it out I just reset the TV and started again, thinking I may have missed something. After a reset the smart Hub populated. Not sure i like the new smart stuff on this thing there is alot going on, maybe because I use to and like the smart hub in my PN60E8000.Comparing this F5500 to the E8000 the E8000 is beautiful in a bright room But I'm Afraid that if you get this F5500 it won't do well in a bright room, but a little over $800 i can deal with it.I put avatar 3D Blu-ray in to see what it would be like i was very impressed it goes to dynamic picture mode on the TV i was very happy to see this movie in 3D using Dynamic mode at factory default right out of the box was way better then i expected.I will update my thoughts in a few days once i get my teeth into this thing so i'll update as i go here.....Thursday May 2nd firmware update1.This firmware is for TV Model(s): LED F5500/F6300/F6350/F6400/F6800/F7050/F7010, PDP F55002.The version is 1102.13.This firmware update will improve the following:- Improves picture quality.- Resolves compatibility issue with Fitness Game Bikei must say that the improvement in picture quality has solidified my choice in buying this PN51F5500 i know there will be more updates.so the choice is yours which one to buy 60F5500 OR 60F8500 if you can afford the price i would still buy the F8500 if i had not just got the E8000 last May i would have gone with the 8500.so here i am I have a PN60E8000 and a PN51F5500After the firmware update i noticed the biggest difference is picture quality when i first got this tv it was a little troubling that i couldn't get the right combination with blacks and color flesh tones seemed to orange or too red and it was starting to trouble me. i was watching a baseball game last night (wednesday) couldn't get it to look natural even reset all the modes and it just wasn't right. tonight i watched washington and the braves after the firmware update the black players didn't have a greenish tint anymore they looked normal the white players don't look orange or bright red i maybe over stating it a bit but now it's very pleasing. blacks are nice and black flesh tones are more normal so i hope i explained it so you'll understand.here was my settingswhen i watched the ball game.picture mode standardcell light 16contrast 94brightnes 45sharpness 0color 48tint 50/50screen size screen fitdynamic contrast offblack tone darkerflesh tone 0rgb offcolor space nativewhite balance all at 25gamma 0motion lighting offcolor tone standarddigital clean view autompeg noise filter autoblack optimizer autothose are the settings I use for it directv as the source going through my TX-NR818UPDATE MAY 8th /13i'm taking one star off till i find out what is going on with this issue read below.i just had a new issue went into apps yesterday and played an Episode of Battle star galactic with (Amazon Instant ) finished watching it closed the app but the tv didn't go back to the the last TV channel i was watching but it gave me a black screen. my set up Directv Genie +  Onkyo TX-NR616 av receiver then going into HDMI 2 (ARC) into the TV.at first i thought it was odd maybe a HDMI handshake thing so i changed the Cables i had a Brand new high speed cable so i replaced it. ??????

Parenti", "ReviewID": "R2UXX2HBNNQZEM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I returned this TV for several reasons.  I have owed a Panasonic plasma for the past 6 years, I am pretty tech-savvy, and this was my first Samsung (and last).The good:-The best picture I've ever seen, hands down.  Amazing, beautiful, 3D was great.  Boom!-I really liked that it had a swivel stand, perfect for my room and couches.-I liked the idea that it interacted with my cable box (stupid Xfinity).  I hate Xfinity's stupid guide so it was nice to have a different way to change channels but I still needed to use the original remote/guide to set a recording, so that was dumb.The jury is still out:-Video games.  I play fast action, multiplayer shooters, specifically COD Black Ops 2 on XBOX.  At first I felt there was input lag and I was sucking, but then a day or two later I was doing really well.  So overall I don't think the input lag is really noticeable or gaming is a problem.  The data collected online seems to show it's not bad and I'll agree.Note 1:  I think all big TV's that are 3D tend to be slower because they come with so much other stuff to process.Note 2:  Yes, game mode was ON but what a pain in the ass to get to it!  You have to sift through 3 menus to unbury it and turn it on.  One nice thing is that you can have HDMI1 on non-game mode and HDMI2or3 on game mode if you have it hooked up that way.So why return it? (all details below)1. The main power button shuts everything OFF, but not ON?!2. The volume button controls the TV volume, not the receiver.  Can be switched but needs to be switched EVERY time?!3. Flickers on/off during video gaming.4. TV guide \"favorites\" just plain didn't work.  Voice control was crap.The details...1. So I messed with this forever before digging around the blogs and finding that Samsung wanted everything to turn OFF with one button, ok, great!  But they didn't want everything to come ON with one button because some people just use regular TV volume instead of whole theatre sound.  So the master power button only turns on TV, you have to use a separate remote for your home theatre.  That's garbage for people who always want the best sound (theatre) which many people do.2. So once you turn your TV and home theatre on separately, and you use the \"universal\" remote to turn sound up, it turns TV up, not theatre.  Uhhgg....ok, so go through 3 menus and you can switch that appropriately so it controls the receiver, but then when you shut the TV off and come back guess what!....It defaults back to TV every damn time.  Wtf?!  So every time I turn the TV on I have to use 2 remotes, then dig through 3 menus to get this \"universal\" remote just to operate the correct volume.  Not very universal if you ask me, and a huge pain in the ass!3. So it didn't happen often, but in 5 days of playing video games, there were times when the screen went black, then about 1-3 seconds later, came back on.  Your guess is as good as mine about what's going on, just saying it was happening once every few hours or so.  Not the end of the world but 1 time is 1 time too many.4. As mentioned above, I hate Xfinity but am stuck with it.  I hate their menu and looked forward to using this TV's own guide.  It says you can filter out channels by checking them on or off.  Cool, I'll make a list of my favorites and finally have a workable guide to view.  I'm a tech-savvy guy and I messed with this for hours and it never worked.  It just continued to show all channels and that was that.  Stupid and frustrating.  Also, the voice control almost never worked.  Not that I cared but I saw a commercial where the lady asked \"what baseball games are on\" and it brought up options.  Not even close, it couldn't understand me, had delay.  It was aweful!Summary:All in all, Samsung has their head up their ass when it comes to being thoughtful about the user and functionality of their TV.  If all you do is turn it on and watch TV or movies, great, get this TV.  It has a wonderful picture, sound was good, 3D was fantastic.  If you have a home theatre and want to utilize some of the toys and perks, then get a Panasonic because this one will frustrate the daylights out of you.  For video games, I hope they don't all have the weird glitch mine had.  As long as that's true, then I liked my experience with games.  Even with game mode off it was pretty great.I hope this review helps some people make a decision.", "Date": "July 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Eh...Just OK.", "Author": "Rod Nutt \"rodnutt\"", "ReviewID": "R3I857E8NXET7K", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Coming from the Panasonic GT series to this set and while the \"Smart\" set is much more advanced than the Panny there are some noteable drawbacks.  Blacks do not seem as deep and there is an awful buzzing noise that gets worse with brighter scenes.  You will likely not notice the sound unless you have the volume down very low/muted but it is definitely different than the Panny.  Remote control is a neat idea but the execution is poor as it will likely take you months to really figure out all the tricks/tips.  Also, the sound is not good, much worse than the Panasonic.  I have to turn it up to 40-50 units while watching movies because voices often sound muffled.  Decent value for roughly $800 but kind of get the feeling Samsung is investing more money into their LED's than plasmas.", "Date": "June 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just ok", "Author": "gamer geek \"fasty\"", "ReviewID": "R39LPDTEV623S8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought it because the deal was good.Shouldn't have gone plasma, and very pixel-y at times, especially with weak inputs through a DirecTV box or a weak Netflix stream.Blu_Rays look good.

It is bland and washed out.  Anything with whites or greys lacks any definition.  I got a calibration Blu-Ray disk and I cannot adjust the white levels to spec.  I have 4 other HDTVs - a 37 inch Visio LCD, a 32 inch Panasonic LCD, a 16 inch Coby bought at Big lots for less than $100, and a little 13\" Axess (I have never heard of it either).  They all have a picture far superior to this set.  I cannot watch it for more than an hour without it hurting my eyes.  I contacted Samsung and they sent out one of their authorized repair people.  He took a look at it and said he had seen worse and he thought it was within spec. but he would let me know.  He took a couple of pictures of the screen with his cell phone.  Today he told me that he compared the pictures on his cell phone with his TV and they were close enough.  I again contacted Samsung.  They said that since their rep said it was within spec there is nothing they will do.  They will send another person out to look at it, this time at my expense.  Based on other reviews of how brilliant they picture is, I know this unit must be defective.  I certainly hope Samsung will stand behind their product.Update - March 8, 2014.  The second service rep also said it was within spec.  I called Amazon and they offered to replace it or I could just return it.  I decided on a replacement since other reviews were so positive.  The replacement was noticeably better but the picture was still somewhat bland especially during daytime.  Based on the picture on the replacement set I have raised my rating from a 1 to a 3.  I called Amazon again and they agreed to my returning it.  I bought a 65\" Vizio M651d-A2 and the picture is spectacular.  The smart features are not a sophisticated as Samsung, but the picture is far more important to me than features.", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "nice tv, horrible stand", "Author": "D.

The main reason for downgrading this purchase is the cheap, horrible stand.  The stand is a god awful color compared to the tv and makes the tv look cheap.  The stand is flimsy, wobbly, and, trying to be nice, it is simply ugly.In addition, this stand makes the tv heigth about 1/2 inch higher than stated, just enough to  not fit completely in the cabinet space that it was intended to fit into. Nothing makes a tv look cheap more than an ugly stand that sits under the television like a four pronged add-on and because of its polished silver color it  cannot be overlooked.  Too bad, a nice tv worth the investment, now I have to find a stand or mount it onto a wal in order to make it fit.", "Date": "May 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "****SAMSUNG IS A RIPOFF****", "Author": "Just Sayin'", "ReviewID": "R3EHL9YXV3BBPT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "*****W A R N I N G*****Do not buy SAMSUNG Televisions!!!  Maybe $2,500.00 - $3,000.00 is not a lot of money for some folks to spend on a television, but it is to me.  This is money I'll never get back, nor derive true enjoyment, nor value from due to the DEFECTIVE SAMSUNG product that I purchased.  After the one year warranty period SAMSUNG Television screens tend to show burn-in and ghosting with horizontal lines, along with very heavy distortion of picture on right side of screen.  This problem is systemic in all their LCD's and LED's.  Consumer's have complained all over the internet.  There are even numerous Youtube postings with the exact same problems as in my DEFECTIVE SAMSUNG model, as well as the same DEFECT in many other DEFECTIVE SAMUNG models.  This defect occurs upon start-up, and lasts for the first 15 minutes of trying to view a program. Then the picture gets progressively worse over time and continuously declines.I tried SAMSUNG's Executive Customer Relations Dept. and was told:  \"We will do nothing but refer you to a local Authorized Repair Shop.\"  They were downright blunt and rude to boot!  I feel robbed of $2,900.00!Furthermore, I was informed that the repair will consist of a diagnosis visit, and then another visit to install a replacement \"Panel\" that costs $1,300.00 for the part plus $279.00 to install, plus taxes......all told, another $1,719.16....at which point the technician basically stated, \"just buy another TV.\"SAMSUNG customer service also told me that their Televisions depreciate at a rate of 20% per year, and that they do not repair any of their products after 4 years!  Their own repair people told me to just buy a new set!!!If I save one family the heartache of losing they're hard-earned money on SYSTEMICALLY DEFECTIVE SAMSUNG TELEVISIONS, and a company that offers zero customer service....I'll be happy!
