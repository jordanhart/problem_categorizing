{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Read before purchasing", "Author": "David L. Howell", "ReviewID": "R2OYUGL4MX80X", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Just wanted to give potential buyers a heads up on this TV. There are two models of this 46 inch TV that are almost identical and this can be confusing as you search for TV's that are LED, 120hz and internet connectable, both are but there are differences. The models are 46PFL7705D/F7 and 46PFL7705DV/F7. The only difference being the \"V\". Here is the difference, the \"V\" model comes with Voodo software, MediaConnect Quick setup guide and USB Wireless LAN IEEE 802.11 b/g/n adapter. Per Philips technical service, the non \"V\" model is internet connectable via ethernet cable only, it is not wireless ready. If you want the wireless version get the \"V\" model. which should be the item you are viewing now.Also know that you can go to Philips.com, go to products, select 7000 series and do a comparison of the two models. There is a box you can select that shows differences only. Trouble is, it shows no difference in the the two models on the web site as of this writing (1-17-2011). But if you select the 40 inch version rather than the 46 inch version 7000 series TV's, \"V\" version verses the non \"V\" version, the differences do show up. I told the tech at Philips this info and he said he would report the problem. Anyway, just trying to help potential purchasers get what they want. I bought the \"V\" version but it is in transit to me now. I wanted to get this info out, so even though I don't have it yet I gave it 3 stars so I don't impact the rating negatively or positively. Hope this helps.Update - This has no bearing on the product itself but even though I ordered a 46PFL7705DV/F7, I was shipped a 46PFL5705DV/F7. Yes, it was the \"V\" model but it was the non LED model, note the difference - 5705 verses the 7705. This is an issue according to Beach Audio (via Amazon) that could not be resolved as they said that they had a coding error between them and Amazon on the products since the two models were so similar, order and pay for the LED model, they ship a non LED model. They didnt have the LED model in stock, couldnt give me date so I had them pick the unit up and I eneded up buying a Samsung as no one had the Sharp 46PFL7705DV/F7 in stock. How ironic that I researched this so well to make sure that I ordered the correct model and still recieved the wrong product...", "Date": "January 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good one", "Author": "Chandru", "ReviewID": "R3U202VEV789VF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this television about 15 days back.  The previous review by the user was very helpful in getting the correct television in terms of wifi connectivity.  I ordered it directly from Amazon and their delivery was prompt and also helped the basic installation.All in all, this television is very good.  The picture quality is amazing and hardly any lag and bad pixels.  The sound quality is good with surround option turned on and to my observation the sound quality for most of the flat televisions are below average but this one is an exception.The only con that i would say with this television is the wifi connectivity.  Initially i had hard time connecting to the wifi network and was occasionally connecting.  The video streaming was not gteat with 3 mpbs speed and connecting was challenge everytime.  I called the philips helpdesk and they were good in analyzing the problem and they sent me a new wifi sensor that can be USB plugged into my television.  After i started using the new USB stub, the connectivity improved and no more challenges connecting every time but still has lag and buffering on many sites such as VUDU, netflix etc., on wifi.  On the other hand if you use a wired connection, there is no con.All in all, this television is good for the people who are looking for a 46 LED with decent sound and picture quality.  Having said that the wifi connectivity is not so great.Hope this helps", "Date": "February 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "If the 46 LED is good as my 40 LED from Phillips I am in", "Author": "Lewis W. Cunningham \"Wayne Cunningham\"", "ReviewID": "R3JQA1S7WLZZH0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In July 2011 I bought my 1st HDTV and this was after many hrs of comparing HDTV brands i.e. Sharp, LG , Sony and others.I was very impress with the easy setup and also the 1080 display. Plus I think Phillips has the best customer service going they are eazy to contact and very helpful. As one reviewer stated there is 2 model of the 46 & also I think of the 40 inch which is what I have. I contacted cusomter serivce and they sent me the wi-fi doggle. But as it turned out I do not have V model but it does have a VGA port so I can plug in my laptop or desktop and watch videos or check my emails. So if one does buy this set make sure before that it is the V model. One the other hand one could by a wi-fi Apple TV or Roku box and save some money as well.  It nice to have choices.Since I am very pleased with my set and price I paided I am giving Philips a 5 star plus.  You can pay more for a set like this but why ?", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't buy it!", "Author": "grpalm1", "ReviewID": "R2KWRKEDRMOO2D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Don't buy this TV!  It is enticing with all of the features, but the image quality does not meet the standards set by other flat screen TVs.  I owned this model for three weeks and could never find a mix of settings that provided the color image that I could watch.  The colors on this model are off -- the bright blues and reds are easily saturated yielding a glowing effect while other colors are muted such as skin tones that are almost missing.  While some images were actually pretty good, the image was very inconsistent/different from channel to channel.  I found myself constantly adjusting the picture settings rather than enjoying the TV.  Also, while the NetTV part was pretty nice, the WiFiConnect feature that displays the PC image on the TV rarely worked.  I only got the PC image on the TV a couple of times out of a dozen attempts, and when it did come up, there was a delay of about 4 to 5 seconds that made using the TV as a monitor interactively with the PC keyboard useless.  I have now returned this model and purchased a Samsung UN46D6000 SmartTV which I love.  No more image/color problems and I still have the internet connectivity (except for the PC display) plus now have access to Samsung apps and other apps.  Paid a little more, but definately worth it as the Philips was unwatchable.", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wi-Fi is Just a Gimmic", "Author": "nikongmer", "ReviewID": "R13EPNCLN5LAX7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV when it was a Gold Box Lightning Deal. I actually paid even less because I used my AMEX points.PROS:The TV itself is great. Great picture, great sound.CONS:I'm disappointed with how bad the wi-fi is on this thing. It's impossible to watch Netflix and will never connect with my pc using MediaConnect. My router speed is G and have read that streaming/connectivity would improve if I used N but my PS3 streams Netflix just fine using the same wi-fi connection. The remote is too long and is awkward to use due to the button spacing. The directional buttons do not always register when pressed and will sometimes input the back or exit buttons instead. It's as if the design of the remote was an afterthought, intending that you use the iphone app in its place (there is no official Android app).I would return this TV if I had not received a good deal on it.", "Date": "April 15, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,699.99", "Features": "Philips MediaConnect\nLED - edgelit\n4 HDMI inputs\nPerfect Pixel\nEnergy Star 4.1\nPhilips MediaConnect with 46 Inch LCD display", "Name": "Philips 46PFL7705DV/F7 46-Inch 120 Hz LED TV with Philips MediaConnect, Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EaG6efY9L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004EL9W96"}}
