This TV is an amazing value when you factor in that a Sony 40-Inch can be found for just $500.  With LIMITED-APPS (listen carefully when I say LIMITED as Sony and Amazon are still at odds and there is no Amazon, Amazon Prime Instant, VUDU, HBO-To-Go or M-Go) and built-in Wi-Fi !I was impressed with the build quality right out of the box.  Sony has cut a few corners and yet enhanced so many others that this still exceeds anything Samsung or LG could offer.PROS:*Ease of set-up.  My 85 year old mom could almost set this up...*Picture depth and color as only Sony can accomplish/great angle viewing*Great but simple remote.*Fabulous SETTINGS in the set itself.*Weight*Speed to process ON/OFF and other functions including sparse APPS*4 HDMI's and 2 USB slots*Not Made In China (my set comes from Mexico)CONS:*Sony has used a 'BRICK' power cord which is far too short and heavy for its power source.  Same type found as on many laptops.* USB is 2.0* HDMI slots are positioned poorly* Base STAND is really cheap and unattractive (VESAA is 300X200)* APPS are VERY weak and few for now (Amazon still doesn't function/no Vudu/No M-Go/No HBO-GO).* APPS such as Amazon Prime Instant and VUDU still do not function/COMING SOON is all you will see on-screen.  Month-after-month.Sony has always been a leader for video and this set prevails.  You'll see Samsung or LG building washers and dryers but you'll never see Sony doing the same.  They build and focus mostly on video/audio entertainment only.COSTCO sells this same set as the KDL-40W590B for a bit less.  Like COSTCO, Amazon is an even better place to purchase this if you are a PRIME member and Amazon is offering PRIME.Worth much more money than its MSRP.Also made in a 48-Inch set for approx; $150 more.  KDL-48W600B.  Costco also carries that version as of this writing as the KDL-48W590B.  Same sub-par APPS with no Amazon, etc (despite it being advertised).

I was also pleasantly surprised by the above average sound quality. I use this TV as a secondary unit in my bedroom which replaced a Sony Bravia 32\" XBR6. Picture is tremendous, almost as good as the Sony picture in the 55W900A but without the Triluminous color chip. If picture quality is what you're after, then I believe this TV is as good as it gets in this size range. Samsung may be a little better with their \"smart\" functions, but the Sony's picture is flat out the best you can get in an LCD LED, in my opinion. And yes,I have compared the Samsung and the Sony side-by-side. Also, this TV is the 40W590B in Costco as another reviewer stated. One last thing, the native refresh rate is 120HZ as claimed by Sony. Amazon has the refresh rate listed incorrectly as 60HZ. All in all a whole lot of TV for around $500.

Yes, it can stream Netflix and Youtube and a bunch of other random stuff; but it's also supposed to stream Amazon Prime instant video and as of now this feature simply gives you a message saying this service is coming soon. Maybe this TV will have Amazon Prime streaming a week from now. Maybe it'll be longer. Maybe never. This TV does not stream HBO Go, and I was told that because of licensing issues it never would. I have yet to see Sprout or PBS show up on their list of streaming services. Because of this, I'm on the brink of purchasing a Roku, which kind of defeats the whole purpose of a Smart TV.The picture quality is good.

I like gadgets and features but I found myself paying for a smaller TV for features such a 3D and Skype Camera which I pretty much never used. (who cares about having a Skype camera on a TV when you have cameras in cell phones, tables and computers? What was I thinking when I got tempted by this feature?!). Don't get me wrong, the TV was really good. I even left a review giving it good rating. However I liked the image quality I never could fall in love with it. Specially blacks, I could see some little gray areas in a dark room in some dark scenes which drove me crazy.Now, I switched TVs. Left the toys aside for a bigger screen size and better image quality which I thought Sony was able to provide. And I wasn't wrong and Sony delivers impressive image quality with this TV, even though the refresh rate is lower than the Samsung (so you cannot choose the \"soap opera\" effect on this TV) which I though I would care or notice but I don'tSumming up, the pros and cons and comparisons with previous TV:Pros:1. Impressive image quality. Specially blacks. Darkest blacks I have seen in any TV I have had.2. It has buttons on the back. The Samsung didn't have any buttons at all (or at least I couldn't find them) (weird)3. Design is truly minimalistic and the borders are really really thin making the TV look more expensive.4. Price. Ridiculously cheap. A 48\" Sony TV for $650? I still cannot believe the price. I keep looking to see what is the catch and I don't see any!5. Smart TV. Less Smart and more basic than the Samsung but still good apps6. Media Player / DLNA support. So far it has been able to reproduce every file I have given to it. I have a Linksys router with a dd-wrt firmware and a minidlna server running in it and I suck all the movies from the router. Works like a charmCons:1. Sound quality. OK, but worse than the Samsung. I had to manually tweak the equalizer until I got a decent audio. Here my specs: Surround effect off (I have never seen a TV able to deliver good surround effect) and equalizer: +8, +8, -4, 0, +4, +7, +72. Wifi slow. When I am watching a movie streaming from mi DLNA Server it cuts off and buffers sometimes. It didnt happen to my Samsung before. (I may consider using wired cable)3. No toys (I knew this already): no 3D, no Skype camera (Skype app yes, but no camera unless you want to add it as an accessory), no 240 Hz refresh rate.This is a really good TV. It does what I wanted (impressive image quality and DLNA support with a good design at a good price) and you cannot get anything closer to this for this price. If you want a good TV for ~650 this is the TV you are looking for.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very happy", "Author": "Charlie", "ReviewID": "R1LN5AAI79Q7FI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm just a regular media consumer...I'm not a picture quality enthusiast, but review websites seem to give this set high marks. I spent a considerable amount of time (too much time, honestly) researching a new TV to purchase. My previous TV was a 32inch Samsung but apparently that size is what people are putting in their bathrooms now. I wanted to get something thinner, lighter, a little bigger, and with a higher resolution. I also wanted to stick with a more reputable brand because of concerns about manufacturing quality and the availability of parts/repair labor if that becomes something I need in the future. The Smart features, particularly Netflix, I will likely use but I'm not particularly interested in them because I already have so many devices that have streaming capabilities (blu ray player, video game consoles, etc.) and those features were not really factored into my purchase decision.This TV is incredibly lightweight (15lb) and was super quick to physically setup (the stand has just two screws if you are planning to use it) and the initial interface setup was also quick. After playing around with some picture tweaking, I am very happy with the picture quality while playing video games and watching TV. I would definitely suggest this TV to others that are looking for a quality TV this size and resolution.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "stunning upgrade!", "Author": "J. York", "ReviewID": "R2Z5T2VW1CXV6S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this to upgrade a 2008 LCD TV in my Kitchen.  As bezels have gotten slimmer, I realized that I could fit this 40\" in the same space I had previously housed a 32\".While I knew I would be getting a nice upgrade in picture size, I can't believe what an upgrade this is in picture quality.  Seeing this Sony LCD next to my 2008 Sharp Aquos is like comparing a color TV to a black and white one.  The picture is far more vibrant, colors look more natural, and everything is a lot crisper.What really blew me away was the improvement in viewing angles.  This TV has quite good viewing angles; the best I've seen on an LCD.  This is important in our kitchen because we're often walking around to different locations that are quite a bit off of the main axis.  The Sony looks great from everywhere I can stand.The Sony has a 300x200 VESA pattern for wall mounting.  Unfortunately, the VESA pattern covers the legacy ports.  So if you want to wall mount this, you may have difficulty using the legacy component inputs.  Most people use HDMI for everything nowadays so that probably won't be an issue for you.I haven't played around with the \"apps\" much.  I ran fPandora and it worked fine.  But it takes too many menu clicks to get to it and each menu click is kind of laggy, causing me to hit the button again and then mess up.  I do like that the TV immediately detected a firmware update was available and updated itself.  Nice not to have to keep track of that kind of stuff!This TV has been a profound upgrade and something I'm going to enjoy for a long time!", "Date": "April 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice TV with weak internet capability", "Author": "Aj", "ReviewID": "R2LO1TKQAMW4AV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros: TV has good sound and excellent picture quality. I have used Samsung 5300 series for more than 18 months and surely rate this Sony model higher than Samsung on audio and picture quality.>Has very sharp and good depth of image. You dont need additional speakers or amplifiers ( unless you want to blow it out). It beats samsung on both picture and sound quality.I would rate the TV 4.5 just for its picture and sound quality. I did compare this model with Samsung 5300 and 5500 series next to it and could see the marked difference in sound and picture.Cons: >When it comes to connectivity, this TV scores 2Has poor internet capability, its takes at least 2 mins for the TV to get IP address and another 2 mins for apps to open. This is poor if you compare my experience with Samsung smart hub feature. I tried using wi-fi first and then changed to wired connectivity, still have the same challenge. Samsung is surely a much better internet ready TV as you dont see the difference between TV and Internet features when it comes to interface and user experience.>Limited apps as Sony hasn't really focused on integrating Sony with all other platforms and apps. It does not have Amazon Prime, Daily Motion etc.>Search feature is a big pain as you to use remote and its not compatible with keyboards ( unlike Samsung)>Makes static reception noise when you change channels.>Unlike Samsung Allshare, this one allows only Sony products to have near field connection for sharing screen.Overall, this TV could beat Samsung on all counts if it just takes care of its internet capability features and adds some small features to make it competitive.", "Date": "April 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great TV but does not work with Amazon instant movies", "Author": "Michael Roth \"twins dad\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZH5FU0SQF6K3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great TV.

Barsamian \"markbarsamian\"", "ReviewID": "R2Z615PX091L81", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased the SONY KDL-40W600B TV and BDP-S3200 Blu-Ray player. I'm very happy with both and give them both five stars.The TV assembles very easily, with a bent metal stand that is simple and not wobbly.The feature set is very impressive for both devices. The remote for each device has buttons that control the essential features of the other device.Immediately after turning the system on and logging both devices onto my home Wi-Fi, both devices looked for updates and installed them.TV picture quality is wonderful.I was surprised by a few things, however.One surprise: Judging by the specs for the two devices, the streaming capabilities seemed to be identical. I assumed that they would have very similar user interfaces for the streaming features, maybe to the point of being a little redundant. But in fact, the interfaces for the streaming features are very different.One big difference is that Amazon Prime works on the BDP-S3200 Blu-Ray player, but not on the KDL-40W600B TV. I assume that at some point SONY will issue an update that activates the Amazon Prime app on the TV. But for now, I'm very glad that I have the Blu-Ray player to access Amazon Prime.Another big difference is that the BDP-S3200 Blu-ray player has a web browser, while the KDL-40W600B TV does not. This sounds like a big deal, but in fact the web browser on the Blu-ray player is so clunky that I don't care to use it. I am not surprised by that: sometimes it seems like all the reviews that I have read of streaming TVs either (a) complain that they have no browser or (b) complain although they do have a browser, it is useless. (One really needs good apps to access online content, and the KDL-40W600b has lots and lots of apps. For instance, I have been amazed at how well the YouTube app works.)Another big difference in the interfaces for the two devices is in the way that they access the media files on my networked home computer. The Blu-Ray player displays the folder tree structure, making it easy to navigate to the files that I want. The TV displays the folders in a big matrix, making it very difficult to find folders.But that difference is moot, really. The truth is that neither device is very handy for browsing the media files on my home computer, and the truth is that it doesn't matter. The reason it does not matter is that it is extremely easy to browse the media files using a computer, and then just play the media to the TV. That is, I commonly use Windows Media player on a laptop in my kitchen to browse through my music collection that is stored on a computer in my office. The browsing is very fast. When I find the album that I want to play, I just tell Windows Media Player to play it to the SONY TV. The TV turns on automatically, and the sound comes out through the nice self-powered Boston Acoustics speaker system that I have attached to the TV.Another surprise: There is a significant difference in ergonomics of the remotes. The remote for the blu-ray player has four large arrow buttons around a center select button. It is very easy to use those arrow buttons, even in the dark. The remote for the TV is a little annoying because the four arrow buttons are not so large, and they are surrounded by an outer ring of buttons that have other functions related to the smart features. Sitting in the dark with my big thumbs, it is easy to press one of the outer buttons when I meant to press an arrow key. This sends the TV off to someplace that I didn't want to go, which is a nuisance. FAIL.But regardless of the little gripes that I have about some details of the streaming features or the remotes, the big conclusion is that I really love both these devices and would highly recommend them both.I look forward to adding a SONY home theater receiver to my system in coming months, so that I can use my larger Hi-Fi speakers.", "Date": "April 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV!", "Author": "Thomas Hoang", "ReviewID": "R1M4QTLVGTGX5N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for about a week now and have been completely blown away by it.  For the price ($500 at the time of this review) it is a steal for the quality you get.  I've had two previous TVs (a Samsung, and an Insignia) and this Sony puts both of them to shame.  The colors are vibrant, yet not oversaturated.  The blacks are also incredibly deep.  When I watched movies on my Samsung, the letterboxes at the top and bottom of the screen were almost gray.  The built-in X-Reality Pro engine makes the images sharper and more realistic.  It also has incredible speakers and sound quality.  It supports Dolby 5.1, deep bass, and has the best sound quality I've heard from TV speakers.  I don't watch cable TV on this, but I use my PS4 and watch Blu-rays and it is breathtaking!Most of the negative reviews on here are citing the fact that Amazon Instant Video is not yet available.  Take that into consideration if you plan to use AIV.  It does include all of the important video streaming apps such as Netflix (the remote also has a dedicated Netflix button!), Hulu Plus, Amazon, YouTube, and hundreds more.I would personally spend the few extra bucks to get this Sony TV as opposed to a Samsung or LG of the same size.

Basically good product but annoying manufacturing flaw", "Author": "Piranesi", "ReviewID": "R18GXWQ9Y3SZJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is only my second LCD t.v. and my first edge-lit LED.  It is also the first time I bought a Sony television.  My wife wanted to try since she really buys into the idea that Sony is simply more dependable.  And we were both happily surprised to find this 40-inch LED at roughly the same price as the corresponding Samsung model.  I was a little worried given that it is a new model and not very much reviewed yet.  But, hey, Sony right?For the most part, it's a great set.  The apps work surprisingly well given how bad wifi streaming is on a lot of Smart televisions.  The picture is fantastic from the right distance.  Sound is strong.  4 HDMI ports is amazing along with 2 USB ports so you can power a chromecast without plugging it into the wall.  Set up was easy.  The set is incredibly light.  All the ports worked and the menus react quickly.There are two noteworthy problems.The first seems to be a design flaw.  The power supply plugs into the back of the television in a very insecure manner.  It just barely clicks into place and the slightest touch can jar it loose.  Once you're set up this may not be a problem, but if you ever have to mess with anything in the back of the set, it will turn off on you and the plug may just outright fall out of its place.  Kind of amazing give how basic \"power supply\" is to product design. The chord between the t.v. and the power brick is also way too short and if you place the t.v. on a somewhat tall t.v. stand, the brick will need to be taped to something or supported somehow.  This is only compounded by the problem with the plug as the weight of the brick will easily pull the plug out of the back of the t.v. if it isn't secured. So, electrical tape may be your t.v. companion!The second problem is more annoying and seems to be a manufacturing flaw in the set I was shipped, which is disappointing given that we went with Sony exactly to avoid just that.  There are visible blotches of light that appear near the bottom of the screen on any white or light-colored surface that is moving (like when watching a hockey game or soccer match).  It is very distracting in those situations but not noticeable in most others (like watching a movie).  You can also see them pretty clearly on any solid background that is somewhat light.  It's true that uneven light or backlight \"bleeding\" is fairly common in LED's, but amazingly, in this case, if you get close to the screen and look down toward the bottom edge, you can see a second screen behind the front panel, some sort of thin plastic screen that is meant to diffuse and distribute the light evenly.  You can see that is is curved away from the panel in one spot at the bottom, just to the right of the Sony logo.  It is supposed to be straight and flush against the edge and stretched tight.  It is also supposed to be invisible to the eye I would guess.  But instead it is sort of \"warped\" or wrinkled in this one place, or maybe just wasn't set in place properly so you can see it behind the main panel.  I'm pretty sure this wrinkle is causing the waves of uneven light just above it, along with a little dark splotch near that spot.It's only been two days and I don't think I'm going to exchange it.  It is only distracting in certain situations and some uneven lighting is just a common issue with edge-lit LEDs.  I figure that the next one will likely have some other slight issue or other and I don't care to be one of those Amazon customers that cycles through product after product over fairly minor glitches until I get one that is perfect, especially when it comes to something as finicky as the edge-lit LED t.v.s that seem to be a bit of a lottery.  But it is disappointing to see such an obvious and easily detectable manufacturing flaw as a warped diffusion (or whatever it is) screen show up in a product that is a pretty big ticket item for us ($500 is nothing to snuffle at).I have no reason to think that this is a common issue and, in fact, searching around I've found no mention of anything like it with this or other models.Meanwhile our other t.v. is a five-year-old \"budget\" Samsung that has had a perfect picture from the moment we got it.", "Date": "May 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love this TV", "Author": "jerryth", "ReviewID": "R1I9SBHHVN0150", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I might be a bit partial as I have 5 Sony flat screen TVs in the house.

The poor rating is for Sony, which originally advertised this Smart TV as including the app for Amazon Prime viewing, but it actually does not have access to Amazon Prime.  Everywhere I researched it on the internet, it said it had Amazon Prime and/or showed the Amazon icon.  I've had the set for two weeks and have patiently waited for it to work.  Today I called Sony only to be told that they do not have the Amazon Prime service available on this 2014 model, and no information on if/when it will become available, despite the fact that Amazon Prime is one of the featured apps on the menu (along with Netflix, MLB, HuluPlus, etc., all of which work fine for me).  Sony did not offer any remedy for this issue, only a quick 'sorry for the inconvenience' from the customer service representative.  Considering that I get a large portion of my content through Amazon Prime, I would have made a different decision on which set to buy if I had known that Amazon Prime was not available on this television.  I feel that Sony has utilized false advertising (I see they have since removed the Amazon Prime logo from their website), and did not offer any remedy (like refunding some money or offering to send me a streaming device that actually gets Amazon Prime).  They obviously do not care about customer service or truth in advertising.  I gave the customer service agent plenty of time and suggestions for how to remedy this, but was only told 'sorry for the inconvenience.'  I'm now researching other TVs in this size range and will approach Best Buy (where I made the purchase) about making an exchange for a brand that does have Amazon Prime.  I have shared this review on the Sony site, and I will be sharing it wherever this Sony model is sold, so other customers are not led down the garden path by an untruthful corporation.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Although it is a very good TV I was a little surprised that the construction ...", "Author": "N.

I saw the great price and decent reviews online and decided to take a risk and purchase a TV that had mixed reviews... Boy do I regret it.It wasn't a few days before this TV had dead pixels forming before my eyes as I proceeded to tell myself it was a quality TV for the price. Next, the HDMI port proceeded to fail and cause the screen to be fuzzy, having to play around with the cord to get the picture back again. THIS TV IS LOW QUALITY. Sure, I expected sub-perfect quality, but I didn't expect a TV that is just absolutely un-watchable.Returning the TV was a nightmare and I don't wish it upon my worst enemy! I wish I would have just purchased a quality TV to begin with.After dealing with the return, I purchased a MUCH better TV for nearly the same price, actually $80 cheaper!.If you want a QUALITY 40 inch TV, check this one out -----> http://amzn.to/SCb3Qp it is here on Amazon.

My house was robbed and I lost 8 grand of electronics and computers. Have been a loyal Sony TV customer for 4 decades! But this new one has turned me against them. So I was piecing together a new sound/entertainment system based on some equipment that I had safely stored in the garage. Audio out with RCA plugs used to be standard. Now all I see is an \"optical audio out. Cannot find any onto online how to adapt this to an \"old tech\" sound system. I guess RCA pin plugs are old tech these days, so I wrote to Sony customer support for help last week. 5 days with no reply! If I do not hear from them in 2 more days, the Sony will be returned and I will try another brand. No more Sonys for this former loyal consumer\u2026.", "Date": "June 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Sony?

I put the unit up on our wall without testing it first because, hey, this is a Sony.  Wrong move.  Once we fired up the flimsily built unit it was apparent that this was a bad set (beyond the poor build).  A black and light checkerboard was apparent through the middle of the display while large black blobs presented in the top middle and bottom middle of the panel (bad light tube?).  I would highly recommend you check one of these less than impressively built units out in person prior to plunking down $500.  The kicker for me -- the power cord resembles that of a laptop.  It has the black brick piece which is fine if your outlet is right behind the tv.  If you are expecting to run a slim cord down a tube, as I was in our bedroom, this will not be the case unless you do some extension cord jury rigging.I wondered how a 40\" Bravia could be $500 these days -- and now I know.  It would not surprise me to find out they are farming out the production of 40\" and down to some other outfit and slapping their name on it.

Both the tv and the Amazon prime gave me a bad experience this time. This is the story. I order the tv on Thursday may 22, hoping to get the tv by Saturday. However, the confirmation email said \"expected delivery on Wednesday May 28\". Weird but i understood as it was memorial day weekend and many people had friday off. Sadly for me, that Wednesday nobody was at home. So i had to ask to have a few hours off and pray to be home at the time of the delivery (having all day off is not worth it. Thats why i bought the thing online!)The delivery, nevertheless, was done at a time i wasnt home. (Murphy's law???) So it was rescheduled for thursday... ok. Another day with this stress. This time i could manage to go home and go work many times, but the stress level went high quickly also... thinking that the FedEx truck will arrive as soon as you leave home (just like Wednesday) was inevitable. Driving back and forth hoping to be there to receive the box gave me a really bad headache. But thats alright. I dont blame Amazon for not having anybody at home to sign for the delivery.So i finally intercepted the FedEx truck and received the tv. My excitement level went high again and happily, I opened the box. Passionately assembled the pieces and then there it goes the first sad face. The tv feels light, cheap and wobbly. Definitely not what i was expecting. Then i remembered the price... Yeah, that's the catch. Strike 1.Well, as long as it works the cheap feeling may fade away. I turned the tv on and then my excitement turned into disappointment. I see huge brighter and darker spots covering almost all the screen of the 48 inches tv. Strike 2.Now I'm really thinking about sending it back but oh well. It may be something temporary. The tv had a large way to travel, and was twice on a delivery truck for many hours. Lets call customer service at Sony, maybe its common on those tvs. So I did. However, all their support was to unplug the tv and plug it again and do the software update. I did but the stains still there. Strike 3.To summarize: if you have someone to sign for the delivery any time it may work for you. Maybe the unit i received got damaged after all this long traveling back and forth. As it respects to me I'll return the tv and will avoid this hassle by getting it at the frys located 15 minutes from my house.
