{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Review for the LE46S605 (not the above model, but identical)", "Author": "AlexanderSchwab", "ReviewID": "R2Y0TELBF6X2DZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Hitachi LE46S605 from Sam's as they are sold out on Amazon and I couldn't be happier. I'm not sure what the difference is between my model and this model but according to the S704's specs they're identical.Pros:Picture- The picture is incredible. I also own a 42\" Phillips LCD and the picture quality is night and day. Watching HD cable (1080i) is a new experience for me with this LED tv. When watching HD movies on cable the quality is almost too good. By this I mean the detail is so precise that it takes away the traditional \"movie\" look.News and sports games in HD are awesome. No complaints here.Settings- Hitachi made an easy to navigate menu system where switching between picture formats is a breeze. I never cared for different formats on past flatscreens, but with this tv it honestly creates a different experience dependent on what your watching.Size and weight- The tv is very light. I carried it up my stairs myself without any difficulty and was playing xbox 5 minutes after opening the box. Its also very thin (~1.5\") and, according to the manual, its very simple to hang on a wall if you decide to not use the swivel stand.Cons:Sound- Being such a thin tv its obviously hard to expect a booming sound. I hooked up my surround sound so this wasnt a problem for me But for anyone without a surround sound system, sound bar, etc you will probably be disappointed in this department.Overall I am very happy with my purchase and will recommend this item to my friends and family.", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Hitachi LE46S650", "Author": "Judith A. Allard", "ReviewID": "ROX197I30356R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I also bought this model at SAMs  It is special number for SAMs. The only difference I could see is that the audio output jack is a eighth inch plug in instead of the RCA jacks. Anyway I took it home and plugged it in and it is great. The only adjustment I made was after two days, I took the color intensity down a little. Picture is great. I do not use any of the computer interface features, but do have a DVD plugged in and have two rf transmitting devices plugged into the audio output. That means that we do not listen to the tv from it's speaker system, we use head sets and tcoil receiver. My wife is hard of hearing and we have bad acoustics in our house, so we have been doing this setup for years.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Hitachi/ the best made", "Author": "Franklin", "ReviewID": "R3G12BVC581PJE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I to bought the model LE46S605/ its great, best way to find out about a product is ask the people that repair them/ i have a model 51SWX20B/ one of the swx model best rear projector made..", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Satisfied after 2 years", "Author": "airgunshooter", "ReviewID": "RPNE4U00UCNVF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Also bought the Sams Club model for $650. almost 2 years ago,and have no complaints, except for the audio sound since there isno room in cabinet for larger better sounding speakers, too thin LED!One reason I chose it was for the RCA output Left/Right Audio plugs,so the old surround system could still be used and not need new optical system.Headphone output 1/8\" jack helps when insomnia happens and I wont wake the spouse...LG blueray with direct internet for Netflix is alternative to cable when nada's on but ads...Have had Hitachi old style crt tvs in past and they always lasted as good as Sonys, love it!", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hitachi=Total Rubbish!", "Author": "jedi knight \"Jacob\"", "ReviewID": "R1USO5S6RI14KF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased a Hitachi L47x03pxw (last yrs. version of this one) dual voltage, dual system TV at a U.S. BX 18 months ago.for $900.00 One week ago the colour suddenly went wonky. People on screen look as if they are massive burn victims and the clarity is totally gone. The screen looks as if there is liquid behind the glass when the telly is switched on. Rang up Hitachi and they claimed they could be of no assistance as the tv was purchased outside of the U.S.! A world wide company that can't access info about their products or even provide a number where I could obtain some sort of assistance! Total rubbish! I read a similar review shortly after purchasing this tv and now I deeply regret that I didn't immediately return this Hitachi rubbish! I wrongly assumed this big brand name was more reliable and customer oriented! Heard very good about Samsung and wish I'd gone that route. Will NEVER buy hitachi again! The customer service people were polite but totally useless. Their \"script\" strongly suggests that they are there to simply put the customer off! Stay away from this sad lot!", "Date": "July 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good, but...", "Author": "Juno", "ReviewID": "REQ75JA6EPHO1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this as a floor model TV at a great price ($400) in a club-store. The RealMotion 120 is great! Moderately-paced motion looks real and impresses. I don't know much about TV specs, but the problem with this one lies in fast-paced action scenes. It sort of blurs the movement which is a shame because most of what I watch is action movies. The colors are bright and the darks are rich. There is, however, only one component and composite input slots, and they share the audio input, so if you have multiple devices which use these, you'll be spending some time behind the screen. On the other hand, it is an HDTV, so it has four HDMI input ports. Another BIG problem for me with this TV is when I play my XBOX 360 through the component cable. Certain scenes in games cause the TV to blank out for 0.5 seconds every 2-3 seconds! I had a similar problem with my Sharp Aquos, but their software update fixed this problem completely. The 2010 software update (which is the latest as of writing this review) for this TV does not fix the problem. This isn't a hardware issue, according to the customer service rep at Hitachi, but he didn't know if and when another update would be made available. My 360 doesn't have HDMI, so I couldn't test that out. All in all, for general viewing pleasure, this TV is fine. For those with more demanding preferences in HDTV (such as one that can handle fast scene changes and action without pixelating or blurring), you can do better than this. For me, at $400, it satisfies.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't Buy It!!", "Author": "docterl", "ReviewID": "R1VYMON9E3517F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased this TV just 1 1/2 years ago from Sam's Club and the screen went all green - like green blobs.
