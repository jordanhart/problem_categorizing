A much brighter picture than the LCD. I've mounted both for my family members. The only thing I didn't like was that the power cord is right in line with the mounting bolts for a wall mount bracket. I had to cut part of the bracket off to install it so that it didn't stick up over the tv.", "Date": "September 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best LED TV for the value and quality", "Author": "Historian89", "ReviewID": "RFJ1WCBN90GDP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently bought the vizio 32\" LED TV. The picture is very clear and brillant when watching netflix or watching a movie on it. Picture is good when watching cable but it varies with service to service company. Could use another component input jack than just one row. This is my 2nd vizio flat screen in 3 years and when I look at my older vizio which is lcd it looks dueller compared to the LED. Overall good buy and would highly recommend it.", "Date": "October 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "2 months.  No issues.

The remote is a bit light weight and the sound is a bit tinny.  Considering the price of this TV those two things are easily overlooked.

I had the cable company install an HD PVR and I was blown away by how awesome the picture was. The quality of the speakers is not the greatest and sound tinny at times so I plan to add surround sound.

Resolution isn't bad. They say on a smaller television it that it doesn't need 1080, but I beg to differ. I can tell the difference. I would still buy it again though for the price that I got. Vizio makes a solid television.The one BAD thing is that the HDMI connections are off to the side so your wires will not be hidden when you hook up your equipment. I can live with it in my workout and gaming room, but would not want it as my main television for this reason.The television is not that small either. 32 inches is plenty if you are on a budget or have a small space.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "No problems here", "Author": "Ahmad J.", "ReviewID": "R1G1PLXR32OM75", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Been looking around Amazon at reviews for 32' around this price range and reviews are the key things to read.
