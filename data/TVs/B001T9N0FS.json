{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Amazing HD Picture, but first TV delivered was defective", "Author": "Icculus", "ReviewID": "R12CLKID14WFL9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WHO TO BUY FROM: Amazon did not have this item in stock, so I waited for Amazon to have it in stock before buying - turned out to be the right decision. I bought another LCD tv last year from \"ButterflyPhoto\", a seller on Amazon's website, and it was a horrible experience. So I vowed never to buy a big ticket item from any other seller than Amazon on its site. Those sellers have such great reviews b/c if you get screwed like I did and the sale never goes through, you can never rate them. So only happy customers get to rate those sellers, hence the above-avg reviews.DELIVERY AND DEFECTIVE TV: I ordered the TV on a Thurs and it was delivered to my house on Tues. Pilot (carrier) called to schedule and appt, brought it into my house, took it out of the box and placed it on my tv stand, then made sure it worked before asking me to sign. But by Friday, a 1/2 cm black line appeared in the screen (yikes!). On Sat. I called Amazon and they were great in shipping out a replacement TV immediately at no extra cost to me (they even gave me the option to replace with another make/model). The new TV arrived the next Fri and Pilot packaged and removed the defective TV. The new TV works fine (so far, fingers crossed). After mentioning my ordeal to several friends, a few mentioned they had defective LCD TVs also - so I guess its not so uncommon.Dealing with Amazon is great. If I bought from those other sellers, I would have been left to deal with Sony via the warranty - No Thanks! Its worth the extra hundred dollars or so to go with Amazon.PICTURE QUALITY: The HD picture is amazing. I had a 2004 42' Sony WEGA that produced 1080i, but the Bravia is a much, much better HD picture (however, it seems Comcast broadcasts in 1080i, not 1080p). When watching sports on my WEGA, the picture could not handle fast action so well. The Bravia corrects this pretty well (via the 120hz) and there is definitely a noticable difference/improvement versus my old WEGA. The 120hz is well worth the money.BOTTOM LINE, at $1,823, I am happy with the TV even after the first one was defective. I found the Samsung to be too glossy a picture and didn't like the touch of red, so the 52v5100 was the perfect TV for me at that price.

I had a 32\" Vizio in its place for the past month, waiting for this model.  Overall, I am very pleased with the set.  As usual, the HD channels look spectacular and the interface is tremendously better than that of the Vizio's.  It is hooked up to a HD DVR cable box, but configuration was a breeze.  The non-HD channels definitely take a huge hit, as they look pretty bad on this size screen.  In reality I wish I could have just gotten a 50\" since the 2\" additional makes a big difference in the overall size, but I am still pleased with the TV and glad I waited for this model to get the improved contrast ratio and 120 refresh rate.", "Date": "March 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Elroy", "ReviewID": "R1FUKHZC57Z6TX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The TV is great, 52 inches is huge.  Motionflow looked very strange at first but I've gotten used to it and prefer it for movies.  The best way I can describe motionflow is like when you are driving and you focus on one particular thing like a road sign or a car for a moment.  That object you focus on stays clear despite how fast it's moving while everything around it gets blurry.  Motionflow acheives the same effect.  It focuses on the subject of the scene and keeps it sharp while everything else moves around it.  Motionflow is a bit unlike your eye in one regard.  Your eye keeps the thing you are focusing on in the center of your vision.  Motionflow keeps the subject of the scene sharp as it moves across the screen.  The difference (that the in focus thing is not in the center of the field of view) can be a bit jarring at first.I've had the TV for about 3 weeks and have had no show stopping issues with it.  The TV is hooked up to a receiver for audio.  I have an HD TV signal coming in through component and bluray coming in via HDMI.  I had to mute the volume on the TV itself to stop it from occasionally popping up the message \"Audio switching to external source\".  I tried using Bravia sync over HDMI but it did not seem to do much but confuse my receiver (it's a sony receiver and it's bravia compatible).  While Bravia sync was on my receiver would sometimes not turn on or switch inputs.  Perhaps I could've gotten the Bravia sync feature to do something useful if I'd read some manuals but it didn't seem like it was worth the hassle.  I still am not sure what Bravia sync is supposed to do.I watched the Harry Potter movies and Fast and Furious in Bluray, they looked great.  When I signed up for Fios I got three free months of HBO.  HBO in HD looks fantastic.  The tv is a huge step up from my 32 inch Westinghouse that has some dead pixels in a line down the right side of the screen.No matter how big you are you'll want the help of another person to help you move the TV.  I'm 6'6\" and I couldn't wrap my arms around it to pick it up.  It's not heavy it's just bulky, unwieldy, and too expensive to drop.  You can pick it up by the bottom of the screen and lean the screen on your body but I don't recommend it because while doing so you won't be able to see where you're going.", "Date": "August 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "This TV has very serious flaws!  Sony is unresponsive!", "Author": "Mitch", "ReviewID": "R2IA87NQ2BD6RU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I wanted to post my thoughts here to inform potential buyers and also to beg Sony to do the right thing and stand behind their products.  Even if it's one of their lower end models, $1,000+ is still a significant amount of money to pay for something that doesn't work properly.I personally own the 52 inch model of this set (KDL-52v5100), but have used the other size models as well.  My comments here pertain to issues that apparently plague the entire Sony Bravia V and S series and have NOT been addressed by the latest firmware update available as of this date.  The bang for the buck on this TV would be great, if not for these issues.  The worst part of it is that Sony has seemingly been completely silent on the issues and has so far refused to acknowledge or do anything about it.  If Sony would just address these issues, my rating would increase significantly.  I've been a lifelong Sony customer, but at this point I cannot imagine buying or recommending another Sony product if this is how they support their products.  I'm really hoping they come through and address this appropriately and restore my faith in the Sony brand.While some common LCD problems, such as clouding and flashlighting do affect some other owners, here is a summary of the two major problems I have personally experienced with these Sony TVs:1.  Visual Problem (Red Flashing) - In some programs, red items in the scene will flash as though someone is boosting the color saturation momentarily.  You can see this color shift in faces, but also in other objects.  This happens on all inputs and with many TV shows, movies, etc.  I see it a lot in the set background of The Daily Show.  There is a whole lot of information about this issue on avsforums, various youtube videos, etc.  Many owners have had multiple service visits and exchanged TVs, without resolving the problem.  There is simply no way that Sony does not know how to reproduce it.2.  Audio Problems - There are frequent audio dropouts.  The sound will cutout and won't come back until the channel is changed or TV power is cycled.  Additionally, when the TV volume is very low (1 to 10), there is significant hiss and noise which make the program audio nearly unintelligible.  Late night quiet viewing is very problematic due to this.  There is also a loud pop whenever the display resolution changes using HDMI.I could learn to live with the audio issues, but the Red Flashing issue is serious and very distracting.  I am seriously hoping that Sony can and will do the right thing and release a firmware fix for this as it very much seems to be a video processing bug which affects all of their Bravia Engine 2 sets.  If Sony won't resolve this, then I plan to fight them tooth and nail while under warranty as these are clearly design and/or manufacturing defects.  I've heard some people try to claim that this is the price to pay for buying one of the \"value\" models and it's par for the course.  That is pure nonsense!  These are NOT simply the quality issues that one might expect, related to contrast ratios, color accuracy, etc.  These are serious flaws!Anyway....hope this information helps potential buyers make a more informed decision.

If you're a viewer with a highly refined eye, you can tweek the picture to your heart's delight through the options menu accessed through the remote.  There are numerous suggestions for custom setting for this TV on the Internet.I was torn between ordering Sony BRAVIA V-Series KDL-52V5100 52-Inch and a similar and the higher rated Samsung LN52A650.  I was leaning toward the Sony because the set was going in a room with several windows, so reflection was a consideration. The Sony screen has a satin non-reflective finish instead of the Samsung's high gloss. Several on-line reviewers had noted that the reflective surface of the Samsung was a problem. When I was ready to pull the trigger on this purchase I found the best Samsung price was $600 higher than the Sony.  That along with my other considerations made up my mind in favor of the Sony.LCD TV's have relatively small speakers, so the quality of sound is decent but limited.  Many will chose to add a surround sound system or at least a couple of external speakers.Purchase and DeliveryI found the best price online at Amazon.com.  I ordered the set Monday and it was delivered to my home on Friday morning.  The driver took the set out of the box and took all of the packing with him (earning a nice tip).  The set came right out of the box mounted on a small fixed black stand.  When I ordered the TV, I also ordered a useful flat panel TV stand with an integrated mount to the back of the set. This raises the TV a couple of feet off of the floor, provides left and righ swivel, and has 2 glass shelves for the cable box, blue Ray, etc.  These stand are available locally or on line for [...].I strongly recommend this television and Amazon.com.", "Date": "July 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "My overview including flaws", "Author": "DellaRocco", "ReviewID": "R24U7OAYUVC4RL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am simply editing the review I gave two weeks after purchasing.  I will not go so far as to say this is a POS, but I'm not happy any longer.  This is whyOne reason why I bought this tv is due to the screen being semi-matte not full gloss.  That is good.I've had the tv for exactly one year now.The lcd panel went bad because a gray line appeared accross half the screen.  All Sony techs knew it was a bad panel.  I tried and pleaded my case ant took it to higher levels in hopes of Sony standing behind their name and giving me a new one.  \"No that is not our warantee policy.\" Sony was however timely and professional in sending their repair tech out to fix it, but COME ON 8 months and my tv went bad?The sound is not the clearest either.NOW the MOST important thing...........the PICTUREUpon further study and hands-on comparing with other tvs in homes  I give the overall picture 3 1/2 star.  It is all about the blacks,darks and grays and shadows.  Amazing how poor this Bravia is when looking at a show in 1080i/720p at scenery where it can be dark.  The blending of colors and shadows on say a wall is very poor.  I'm sure the tv having an 8 bit color process vs the 10 bit doesnt help either.I do like the ability to control over 20 settings allowing good tweaking.  I'm happy with the number of inputs.  I will say the 60 vs 120 Hz is a big difference.  The 240 vs 120 I can't tell.  The motionflow I don't see too much benefit.

Sony is unresponsive!\"  but I think the issue here needs a review of its own.I purchased my Sony BRAVIA V-Series KDL-52V5100 52-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV in December, 2009. Since that date my TV has, four times, been rendered blank and totally unresponsive to any input from the remote or on-set controls except power off. A 30-minute phone call to Sony support after the first incident did not resolve the issue; I had to attempt a work-around on my own - I'll explain that later.After the fourth occurrence I arranged for a Sony-authorized service tech to examine the set. Listen to this: he told me he'd had many similar complaints. Apparently here in San Diego a certain HD channel occasionally triggers a glitch in the Sony TV circuitry causing the TV to go blank and unresponsive. Only by tricking the TV to disengage from this particular channel can you get the TV to work again. When he explained this to me I realized my favorite channel was this particular one and my set always froze when I was watching a program on that channel.The service tech checked the current firmware on my set and saw it was the latest version available. In that case, said he, there was nothing he could do. He further said that Sony is aware of this problem and is working on a fix, but he wondered how they would notify owners and deliver the fix when available.After the service call I contacted Sony Support to ask about how I would learn of the fix when it becomes available. I was directed to Customer Relations. In a phone conversation the representative claimed Sony was NOT aware of any such situation. The only remedies forthcoming from Customer Relations were to offer either the phone numbers of 2 more authorized service centers or a promise to have another Sony advisor call me. I requested both; the rep agreed. Then I repeated my statement that I know there are many Sony customers complaining about this, and I read to him some postings from an internet forum I'd discovered. The representative then said Sony now stands informed and aware. We'll see...Anyone, including Sony Support and Customer Relations personnel, can do a Google search and find references to this and similar issues. Personally I've posted about this and gotten response from other Sony owners. But other TV manufacturers have had similar problems with some of their models; Sony isn't alone here. LG, for example, has had this type of problem with some of its sets (do a Google search) but, unlike the initial response from my Sony Customer Relations representative, has publicly acknowledged it.My internet research seems to indicate this glitch occurs with other Sony models as well and in other locations - not just here in San Diego. As the original reviewer says, this may be a low-end Sony, but my $1200 seems pretty high-end to me!Work-arounds I've culled from the internet:1. Unplug the set and walk away for a while. I once did so for 48 hours and it came right back on.2. Turn off the TV (you can do this with the remote or the on-set control), turn it back on and immediately begin madly punching the channel up/down button so the TV switches away from the poison channel before it can freeze the TV again.3. Turn off the TV (this is ALL you can do with the remote or on-set control at this point!), disconnect the antenna cable from the set, turn the set back on, change the (now blank) channel up or down, re-connect the cable.Voila!

Watching football on Fox was in HD and much, much better than the regular cable version.Once the channels were in it was time to be judgmental.

The speakers are rather tinny sounding with no bass.* The quality of this HDTV, like most on the market, requires that you learn how to calibrate the TV to THX or another standard. Otherwise, you are not getting all the quality that the TV is capable of.* The HDMI input does not communicate well with the current Verizon FiOS Motorola HD QIP 71001 set top box. The picture flickers intermittently, goes to green screen, or goes to black depending upon the channel selected. Switching the set top box to feed this Sony using component cables solves the issue, but it is disappointing that neither Sony, Motorola, nor Verizon want to take ownership of this HDMI problem.Overall, the picture quality of this TV blew away other 120 Hz LCD HDTV's both priced at this level & even $1,000 more. To get a better picture, if you know how to calibrate an HDTV, you would have to spend several thousand dollars more.

I purchased from another vendor for a bit lower cost, but I did so reluctantly because I have had very good luck with Amazon.  The TV showed up well-packaged an in good condition.  Set up is easy.I selected this TV because it is in a bright room with many windows.  LCDs are better than plasma for such conditions, I've been told.  Also, this Sony has a less glossy screen than other worthy competitors, like Samsung. You can test this by going to a showroom and looking for glare from the store lights on the screens. This TV has worked well in bright conditions.The picture quality is very good.  There are adequate inputs, we have an HD cable DVR, a Sony blue ray player, and an xbox 360, all connected with hdmi (there are 4 hdmi inputs), and a Wii.  There is a standard connection for your pc, if the pc doesn't have an hdmi port.Network / Internet devices:  I found that I could view video and pictures stored on my Windows XP PC on the TV using the xbox (connected to a Cisco wireless ethernet bridge, bought at Amazon, works great).  To connect to a computer through the xbox, you will need a wired network or a wireless router with an ethernet bridge near the TV. The Blue Ray is a Sony BDP-N460, which connects to the internet and allows viewing of some free and some pay content, including movies, from a number of providers, including Amazon.  It is pretty neat and gives choices for on-demand movies that seem less expensive than my cable provider offerings.To connect multiple devices to the internet you can get a TrendNet ethernet switch at Amazon for $10, which will allow up to 4 internet connections from one cable or wireless bridge.  I purchased inexepensive HDMI cables from Amazon, and they seem to work fine (you can pay a lot for cables, the $5-10 versions that I bought work well).TV sound is OK.  I ran an rca cable out to an old stereo and use that for movies when quality sound is desired (obviously a surround sound system would work as well).Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase of the TV, and the other components that make the TV more functional.

IMHO motion flow is best suited when watching porn at 1080p and Courtney Cummz & Phoenix Marie has never looked better, I could never go back to standard def after seeing that....Overall excellent product & highly recommended, The only gripe I have is with Amazon's Yo-yo pricing model,I bought this at $1414 only to look a couple of weeks later and it dropped to $1249 and back up to $1500 etc.....", "Date": "November 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Latest V-Series Version a Winner", "Author": "S.

Superb setup, vibrant colors, and reasonably good sound.  I had nary a single problem.  The TV was connected to a Sony AVR model DG45ID and I had a fine surround system.  There were the occasional sound dropouts through HDMI but that was easily corrected by using component video cables and then by upgrading to the latest firmware.I then sold the receiver and replaced it with a higher end AV 7.2 receiver.  I started having severe problems with HDMI/HDCP handshaking.  Everytime I would switch inputs on the receiver, the TV would lose its HDMI connection and I had to move the cable to a different port on the back of the Sony to force a handshake.Two weeks of research initially convinced me that the Sony was simply incompatible with the newer 3D compliant HDMI 1.4 receivers.  I read posts calling the KDL series \"Lemons.\"  I had swapped receivers, upgraded receiver firmware, bought new cables - everything pointed to the Sony TV.With a four year warranty on the Sony, I was able to have the main logic board replaced.  That too did not help.  The retail store from which I bought the TV told me that there was nothing they could do - even though the set was under warranty.Then two days after the logic board replacement, the AV receiver reported that another firmware upgrade was now available.  I installed the upgrade.  All problems gone.This is a fine set.  HDMI handshaking and compatibility between vendors can be a challenge.

Before this TV, I'd never had an HDTV or a TV anywhere near this size either. I am pretty tech savvy but HDTVs were not my specialty. With that being stated, I will give you my experience with this particular HDTV.Since the beginning of 2009, I'd been looking at TVs off and on with the help of \"CNET\", just google it, and I'd heard that Sony had an impressive line of entry HDTVs. But I put off the thought of buying one until the middle of June. I was fumbling around on BestBuy's website (sorry Amazon, at the time, I found a better price. BTW, its just a product review.) and in the \"weekly specials\" I found this TV on sale for $1499.99, down from its original price of $1999.99. It was the HDTV that I had favored the most from CNET's reviews, so I made some calls around and none of the stores close had it. I managed to find a store about an hour away that had 2 left, 1 in stock and 1 on display. Drove an hour to check it out and loved it. I added the 3 or 4 year \"bring it back no matter what\" warranty and after taxes came out to just under $2250, which I paid on the spot in cash, I had not-so-great credit.Brought it home and set it up and it was a beauty. It took about 30-45 minutes for the TV to recognize (it did something to find all the available cable channels) the channels and our first DVD experience was through our Xbox 360 and it was the Dane Cook's HBO comedy special. The show wasn't that greatest thing I'd ever seen BUT the freaking picture was. BTW, the HD cable, Xbox 360, and our Wii look superb on it as well. (Now if I can just get my hands on some Blu-Ray material.)***PROBLEMS***I guess every rose has its thorns (haha, cheesy), well this one has (2) of them, and they aren't really thorns.1st - MOTION FLOW: To my knowledge(I could be wrong), the MotionFlow feature is the HDTV's way of enabling the 120Hz refresh rate, which is AWESOME, BUT you can't just quickly toggle between the 3 options they have for the MotionFlow,(Off, Standard, Full) I mean, you can preview them on the MotionFlow screen, but no quick adjustment feature/button. You have to go into the picture settings every time and slowly make your way to the advanced settings at the bottom of the screen.2nd - When you have the MotionFlow on \"Full\" there are still parts during whatever you're watching that don't continuously show in that \"smooth frame experience\". I'm thinking that the 240Hz HDTVs are probably more dedicated to the continuous MotionFlow. It's nothing to cry about.Other than that, the TV is great. The sound is great, it ranges from 0 to 100 and at 60 its good enough for me. Don't get me wrong, I'd go with a home theater system, but for now its nice. The remote is easy to understand and navigate. I would recommend it to anyone else who was in the same shoes that I was in.

I also don't want to mess with problems and/or flaws. This product met one of those - it works coming out of the box. However, it does have a manufacturing flaw in it that causes the sound to just kind of fizzle out and it will stay out for a couple of minutes, or it will come back on if you turn the tv off and then on again. That wouldn't even bother me as much but it takes longer than a regular tv for the picture to come back up. Anyway, it took 3 online chats with Sony and 2 firmware upgrades for the problem to be \"fixed\"...it still happens periodically. Also, we are having a problem with the picture going black and then coming back on. It's almost as though the cable is going out. This may not apply to you, because it applies to Time Warner Cable. TWC has new digital cable boxes they rolled out this summer (2010) and between their manufacture and some Sony tv's, there is something missing that causes the picture to go in and out like that. The way to fix it is to hook up even more cables in addition to the HDMI cable. Wouldn't be too much of a problem if our tv wasn't wall mounted and it wouldn't be extremely hard to get those cables down the wall and out the already full hole in the wall.

I don't know anyone who has ordered such a large item from Amazon and have heard it's hard to get anyone on the phone from Amazon.  But I found the number if you have questions about electronics.  I called and spoke to a nice and friendly gentleman who answered all my questions about the warranty, delivery and purchasing.  After reading other reviews too and after speaking with this guy I went ahead with the purchase.  I watched the tracking of the TV for a few days and as described, the delivery company called me up to say the TV could be delivered tomorrow to us (Friday) or Monday and gave me a 4 hr window.  So the next day, towards the end of the 4 hr window, but still within it, two professional deliverymen arrived and brought in our TV.  They unpackaged the TV and they even set it up with our new HDMI cable and new HD Directv receiver.  I was told they wouldn't set it up, just plug it in to make sure it worked.  I was very impressed with the ease of purchase, the fast (it came earlier than expected) and easy delivery.  I would recommend buying a large TV from Amazon.  My husband said at one point he thought the sound from the TV had some static but it seems to be an isolated incident.  The TV is awesome and the picture is amazing.

However, since my Comcast system cannot deliver me anything in 1080p yet, I wonder why I paid the extra money for it (?). I have experienced glitches with the cable box/tv interface wherein I will be watching an HD channel (WCVB ch. 805)and arrow up or down to go to another channel. What happens is a forced picture-in-picture effect wherein the image is condensed and pushed to the far left of the screen, while the right side of the screen is an image from the same scene frozen and vibrating. I cannot get out of this screen unless I shut off the tv and turn it back on. My cable guy tells me he has not seen this particular problem yet, since I have the brand new compact style cable box paired with a brand new HDTV. Supposedly the tv thinks it should be presenting a picture in 1080p when the most it can deliver through cable is 1080i or 720p and this messes up the signal between the box and the tv. For now, I have it set at 720p and am awaiting a call from Comcast to see if they have an older style cable box that might solve the problem. Otherwise, the big picture is great, the sound is ok, and the lag time required for the tv to respond to commands is a little annoying, but my six boys, my husband and I are really enjoying the blu ray movies and super picture on the nature and sports channels!", "Date": "August 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "POOR SHIPMENT METHOD AND PRODUCT CARE! STAY AWAY FROM AMAZON FREIGHT SHIPMENTS!", "Author": "JCCJR1982", "ReviewID": "R2HATPRW7AJCUM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Yesterday afternoon, it was pouring rain outside, and the CEVA courier parked on the street and came to my apartment complex. I asked him very specifically if he could pull his truck into the complex parking lot next to the stairwell (to minimize rain contact, and also since I live on the 2nd floor). He said \"Sure\". I waited, and was wondering where he was at. Next thing I know and to my surprise, he came around the corner hauling the box on a dolly from the street!The box was SOAKED! On top of that, he asked me if I could help him bring the box up the stairs. According to Amazon and the CEVA transport document, this delivery was suppose to be \"White Glove\" service. Instead of wasting time arguing with the delivery driver while the TV was getting even more wet, I helped him carry the box up the stairs into my apartment. I told him \"What's the deal, the box is absolutely soaked now!\". He had the audacity to tell me \"It's not a big deal. The TV is covered in plastic inside.\" He then asked me if I wanted to open it up. Of course we did, and while at it he got water all over my guitar/drumset with his rain repelling jacket. There was a foam bag covering the TV, with water speckles everywhere, since 2 of the hand holds on the box were torn upwards, and there was also a big gash on the top corner of the box. The bottom of the box somehow was completely drenched, as I think the driver may of rested it on the flooded street before putting it on a dolly. Absolutely distraught, I wrote my name on the invoice and asked him to leave. I was not going to attempt to plug it in since the driver apparently didn't understand the concept of Electricity/Electricial Components + Water = Damage and possible Shock. I was soaked, the TV's box was soaked, my rug was soaked, and to top it off the driver got some of my personal belongings wet.I removed the foam bag, and unfortunately some water did seep through into the TV since the foam bag opening was top folded (remember the box had torn hand holds and a big gash in the top right corner). Also upon further inspection, the manual and batteries did get wet since they were taped to the bottom of the soaked box hidden under the TV stand.If the driver did what I asked him by pulling his truck to the stairwell, the box would only had minimal contact with water (if none) while carrying it up the stairwell, as my passageway is covered. Unfortunately the driver just disregarded what I asked him, so the box was out in the pouring rain probably for a good minute while he was hauling it from the street. It was just jaw dropping painful watching this occur.It's completely shocking that a shipment courier showed no due diligence in the care of my expensive package. He didn't even attempt to cover it with anything, as his excuse was \"it has plastic inside\". I would of gladly provided him with a tarp, but it was too late as he decided to carry it from the street.Say even in the best case scenario the TV has no contact with water. What if this item was going to be a gift? The packaging is just as important as the contents, and the condition of the packaging does reflect the care of the product.I contacted Amazon.com regarding this issue, and the only thing they can do is schedule a pickup, and issue a refund since the TV is no longer in stock for replacement. They didn't even offer a subsitute!In an attempt to get a replacement television, I contacted Sony's customer relations, and was told to not to even install and power on the television and it would pose a potentional shock/hardware hazard due to water contact. They told me that since the problem is due to the shipper's negligence, I have to file a claim with the shipper and Sony cannot replace the TV.So in the end I'm left with nothing. This has caused me alot of anxiety and a big headache. Whether or not this may be an isolated incident, this delivery person really is going to give CEVA and Amazon a bad name and impression due to his negligence and lack of due diligence. I know Amazon is not the ones directly at fault. I purchased MANY times from Amazon, and this is the first of an incident like this. This is also my first experience with CEVA, so putting those two together, and its easy to see who's fault this is. I plan on informing the BBB, and if they suggest so, I may even file with the FTC consumer protection department.Rain or no rain, if CEVA hires delivery personnel with this much common sense, who knows what else our packages are subjected to.This treatment of expensive shipments is something that should not be tolerated, and it would be unfortunate for this incident to happen to someone else.", "Date": "December 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "WOW!!!!!!!!
