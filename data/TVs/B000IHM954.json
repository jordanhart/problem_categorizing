Bowman \"Tech Dork\"", "ReviewID": "R1TT2HFYLHAXTS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had to replace my 61\" Sony XBR 1080i 4:3 projection TV. We loved that TV. This was the only TV available that was similar in size. The 60\" 16:9 TVs weren't big enough. I got this two weeks ago. HD Tivo looks epic. We find ourselves watching nature programs that we typically wouldn't watch, but the picture is so amazing.I looked into the Mitsu and Samsung 73\" models, but they didn't seem to have the same quality.I recommend looking for another stand. We actually found a BDI credenza that was 77\" wide. The factory stand is surprisingly character-less and sterile. I also recommend grabbing a HDMI upconvert DVD player if you aren't going to go BlueRay or HD-DVD.We couldn't be happier.", "Date": "March 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "Fantastic large display", "Author": "Blue 911", "ReviewID": "R3VEHUH8DXFANL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this display for two months and am continually in awe of how fantastic HD looks.  Watched \"Polar Express\" with the kids this week--very smooth, no banding, great color saturation, excellent contrast (has that 3-D depth that you see with plasmas).When you first get it home, the display will look immense, but you very quickly get used to it.  10-11 feet away is the sweet spot.  After seeing movies and sports on a 70\" screen, there's no way you would be happy with a 60\" or smaller.Highly recommended.", "Date": "December 2, 2006"}, {"Title": "As good as you can get for size and price.", "Author": "Michael H. Kaplan", "ReviewID": "R22NPQ3YHT0N1S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You must see this RPTV in a darkened room with the proper settings to appreciate the excellence of this product. This is as good as it gets for $4400 (Appliance Best Buys) delivered. Forget LCDs and Plasmas- if you have two feet to spare for the depth of this unit you will not be disappointed.  Sony packaging is inadequate so be careful of the shipping coverage.", "Date": "May 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Amazing quality...Excellent value", "Author": "M. Shafiq \"Max\"", "ReviewID": "R9RMDMEND5UUW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been looking for a large screen TV for the past 2 years. Have done extensive reviews and research into the best technologies versus price point. The 1080i version of this TV was selling for $13000 last year (albeit it was \"hand-made\") but personally I do not care for that. Botton line is that of you have the space and want the best picture quality then Sony XBR2 is the way to go. I bought mine a little over 2 weeks ago and it has already become a center piece of my living room. Watching movies at night with all the lights closed is an experience. Even though I am sitting 10-12 feet away the screen is so big that it looks super. In fact I have sat as close as 6 feet away and everything is clear as crystal with HD TV. Can't wait to get Blu-ray player. It also comes with a spare bulb (handy). Bottom line is you can't beat this TV. I challenge anyone to tell me otherwise :-) Worth the money.", "Date": "November 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "the best TV in Market", "Author": "Ramiro Coronel \"RCN\"", "ReviewID": "R1YD5VBABKQ6LF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Compre este TV hace 1 mes en Dolphin Mall, es el mejor Tv que existe en el mercado, la imagen es nitida y el tama\u00f1o es espectacular. Se sacan los parlantes y viene con una lampara de repuesto, el remote control esta mejor que el de 60xbr2. Estoy feliz con mi TV.", "Date": "January 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "WAIT TILL AROUND SUMMER!!!!", "Author": "Benjamin Kidman", "ReviewID": "RUDUGL1CODNTC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I Really like this TV, Because of brand and picture quality, is the best in the market, All the TVS I owned since back in 80s was Sony and even new ones I have NOW, I happy with every penny I paid, I have 42\" HDTV LCD, I bought couple years ago for my bed room and still have &I; love it. Now I want to upgrade, my living room TV to this, 70XBR2..But WOW, the price is back breaker. I remember I bought 65\" FULL HDTV back in 2002, remember in those big cabinet they used to make,I paid for little over $2000 for that huge TV.. Now this is sane in price. I guess just wait around till summer time; I'll get this around $4000.
