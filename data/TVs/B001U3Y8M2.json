{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Picture and Sound - Port Selection was interesting", "Author": "B. Hoak", "ReviewID": "R3MCQTZ1OSTAAS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a new model (out March 2009), and is the just released 'B' version of the popular, judging by the many reviews, samsung 'A' version 32 inch TV. I wanted a TV with an excellent value for a 32 inch TV with a good 720p picture and sound.  The picture is actually fantastic and looks good on the standard setting and really stunning at the dynamic setting (if the room is light enough), and in the store looked slightly better then Sony Bravia S-Series KDL-32S5100 32-Inch 1080p LCD HDTV, Black even though that TV is a 1080p one. I did a visual comparison of the two for a while in the store becuase I was trying to justify going 1080p but couldnt since this picture seemed better even at 720p. If I could, I would have gone for the Sony BRAVIA XBR KDL-32XBR9 32-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV which looked the best though for a 32 inch overall.720p vs 1080p:I couldn't understand why a 1080p TV would make a difference with this size of TV, since I sit about nine feet away and at that distance I don't think you could tell - at least the PC input is small enough and sharp enough that I can read web pages comfortably from my couch but if it were any smaller it would be too small/detailed. I dont think I would use more than 720p detail unless I wanted to see more web page content on the screen and planned to sit about 4 feet away. The TV has exactly the same resolution asToshiba Satellite U305-S2804 13.3-inch Laptop (Intel Core 2 Duo T5450 Processor, 2 GB RAM, 160 GB Hard Drive, Vista Premium) which is what I plugged into the PC input and looks identical to that screen. Also, most Hi Def inputs to my TV aren't more than 720p anyway. I think one over the air station is 1080i.Standard DEF Input Handling:For 480i or standard def inputs at a non wide screen resolution, such as those from my cable box, it handles it extremely well. However, I have a digital cable box (verizon QIP6416-2) with an HMDI, component, svideo, and RCA even though the signal I get is only standard def. I didn't want to use up an HDMI port on the TV so I tried connecting the component but the color didn't work. This is an issue with the cable box, not the TV. I had to use the HDMI in the end since there was no s-video (a small negative for this TV) and didnt want to use the RCA. On the plus side, this TV has a great setting called wide fit/move that slightly streaches and zooms a 4/3 picture to fit the 16/9 widescreen. The move comes into play if you have channel that has scrolling text that becomes cut off at the bottom, so you can nudge the picture up a bit (which chops off the top more but you need to make a comprimose somewhere).Shines with HD inputs:When I hooked the component connections up to an HD upscaling DVD player Samsung DVD-HD860 Up-Converting DVD Playerthough that worked perfectly with the component connection.  My beloved Roku Roku Digital Video Player box is using the 2nd HDMI connector which looks great, and the over the air antenna CLEARSTREAM2 Antenna brings in over the air free HD on about 20 HD channels. All the HD sources (laptop, antenna, roku, upscaling DVD) really shine. Sound is good and I don't feel I need to get add on home theater sound since I dont turn the TV up loud.  I guess an extra HDMI connection would have been nice, especially since there was no S-video, but I still give the TV 5 stars as it is a new model and is thus forward looking.", "Date": "March 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "THE BEST LCD ON THE MARKET FOR ITS  PRICE, PERIOD...", "Author": "James Wright", "ReviewID": "RSVBMN2OM8W5J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I badly needed a new television, and decided on a whim to head to best buy and see what was available.  I hadn't been shopping for tv's in around 7 years, and from what I remembered that was when plasmas were amazing but all cost upwards of $4,000, and LCD, as a technology, just wasn't there yet.  To my amazement the TV's in the store, even those well under $1,000, all looked fantastic.  I settled on this tv after comparing it, endlessly, to other 32-inch models by Sony, Toshiba and LG.  The Samsung had the best clarity, image depth and color.  For only $550, this TV is gorgeous...standard cable looks good, DVD looks fantastic, and HD is just amazing.  After initially thinking I wanted a 1080p HD, not 720p, I realized that in this size it just doesn't matter, and isn't worth the extra money.  In all honesty, I felt like the 1080p image in this size television is a bit too sharp, a bit too bright and a bit too clear...it almost makes everything look like a cartoon or a video game.  In the end, you really can't beat this television...the internal speakers sound great, it looks damn sexy in any room, and the picture quality makes you wonder why you paid so little...", "Date": "April 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent Buy!

After going to Target, Walmart, BestBuy, and various online stores, I decided to purchase the Samsung after MANY comparisons, and for only $499.99 at BestBuy.Between the price, brand name, and overall quality we can expect from Samsung, it just made sense to buy this television set over Sony. This television was bought with the intention of not spending more than $500 and having it perform at least above average for my bedroom.Upon looking at comparable televisions, the Samsung had an AMAZING picture. It was EXCEPTIONALLY clear and very clean, new, and expensive looking. The options were exactly what I wanted: Computer input, 2 HDMI cable inputs, and multiple component inputs. It was 720P but after speaking with many owners and doing more and more research, it just isn't worth the money to purchase a 1080p TV set ($700+) when you WON'T be able to tell ANY real difference under 40\" television sets - THAT IS A GUARANTEED FACT!Hope that helped....", "Date": "June 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Stunning....", "Author": "Floyd Goodrich \"Jim G.\"", "ReviewID": "R1LQUXI6G2E1LK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had mine for three days now and could not be more pleased.

Linch Jr.", "ReviewID": "RNEKT5TD7CKKO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this TV from Walmart about three weeks ago... and returned it three days later.I typically do lots of research before buying anything in this price range but, trusting the Samsung quality and ignoring the little voice in my head telling me not to \"impulse shop\", I went ahead and bought it anyway.  Couple issues I noted right away:1. The speakers would \"pop\", but randomly.  It might go one minute with hardly a pop, then you would hear six or seven in a matter of seconds, but it was subtle... often getting drown out by the volume itself.  But, once you noticed it for the first time, it was hard to ignore.  Im guessing these were the result of defective speaker(s).2. Being in the least used room, I had this TV hooked up to our lone standard definition cable (satellite) box.  While having read about blurred images in fast moving scenes on LCD's, I thought modern technology had pretty much eliminated this old shortcoming.  I was wrong.  I wasnt watching sports either, I was watching the 10 o'clock news.  It seemed whenever the news anchor turned their head, their head would stop just a split second before the image seemed to fully catch up.  My other two hi-def TV's are plasma and rear-projection LCD (modern tech only 5 years ago but now hard to find) and I had never noticed that shortcoming on either of them (but nor was their technology known to suffer from this).What else?  Even had the speakers not \"popped\", I thought the sound quality was poor.  It doesnt help that the speakers are built into the bottom frame facing down... meaning they are firing into the TV stand instead of out towards your ears.  Why some manufacturers are doing this is beyond me.  Again, being in our least used room, this TV was going to be stand alone... not hooked up to a receiver and alternate speakers.  Lastly, as others have stated about \"piano black\" finishes, its looks nice but attracts finger prints, hair, dust, etc.I know Samsung typically makes a quality HDTV product, but I think trying to appeal to the lower end of the price spectrum will cause companies to perhaps take shortcuts that they wouldnt make on their higher end sets.  That being said, of all the other 32 inch HDTV I viewed at Walmart, I thought this one had the best picture... in the store anyway.  :)", "Date": "August 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very good set for the $!", "Author": "J.

Due to the compact size of the flat screen, it replaced a 21\" box. The price was comparable to a Vizio at my local Walmart. I'll take a Sammy over a Vizio anytime. It came as specified in just a few days, mounted to the Cheetah wall mount I purchased here on Amazon, and I was enjoying the set in no time. I only rated it 4 stars due to the pic being 720, which for a 32\" is good for a bedroom or den IMO. I think it would come up a little short for a home theater unit (what are you expecting for around $450!).

A lot has happened in electronics in the past 10 years! As someone who is not a high tech expert, I just wanted a tv that was inexpensive, , easy to use, and not loaded with stuff I would never use.I started talking with salespeople at BestBuy, Walmart, and Sears, and they all told me to go with a Samsung or a Sony. After reading reviews on this site and others, I decided to narrow my search to the Samsung models as the Sony 32\" models seems to have a lot of problems with \"boards\" within the first year----so, a Samsung it would be.I found the 32\" model on sale in several places, all around the $450 mark.(my limit was $500) Went to BestBuy where they price match, and got an open box model for even less---$399! Score!The tv was easy to set up (even for me! I really am NOT an electronics kind of guy) and within minutes I had an amazing picture off this set! I do NOT have cable, and am using only a digital antenna to get the signal, and still the picture is incredible! The pre-set settings for color, sound and such are just fine for me, and even though the sound comes out the bottom of the set, it sounds just fine to me. (other people reviewed that the sound was tinny and weak) I have only had the tv for 3 days now, so I am still getting used to this large , clear, defined picture, but so far so good! (you really DO see things much clearer, especially peoples faces) I would definitely recommend this television to people who arent totally into the whole \"I need the top of the line television with all the bells and whistles\".Depending on where you are, you should be able to pick this up for around $450-$475.Hope I am just as happy 2 years from now!", "Date": "November 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Beautiful TV, Great Price", "Author": "B.

I was waiting for the \"Black Friday\" deals to come around, but I thought this was smarter as facing those massive crowds of consumer hungry individuals wasn't on my list of things I would like to do.Anyway, the Samsung has done nothing but impress me for the price. The first thing I did was hook up my PS3 and 360 in order to check that all was up to par. There is very minimal blur (to be expected from a 60hz LCD) but nothing too distracting as long as the viewer is at least 3-4 feet from the screen. I sit 7 so I barely noticed it. I am used to a 42\" plasma that has no blur at all, so it took a little adjusting, but nothing major. Next I streaming Netflix. The SD movies were acceptable and the HD looked amazing. I would say it passed the test for that as well. I moved on to streaming HD content from my laptop through the xbox. This, again, looked more than acceptable. All I had left was BluRay... and let's just say that this was the cream of the crop when it came to the tests short of playing a game on the tv. The picture was crisp, bright, colorful and accurate. The blacks were great and the whites were blinding if chosen so.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this purchase.

Xbox 360, PC, Standard Def Cable, HDMI, all of the inputs necessary are available here.

Sony and Panasonic have some good TV's at this size and near this price range, but in my opinion, this TV has the best picture of the three.

Ram", "ReviewID": "RQS9MATW7SLVB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was going to write a long review of this TV, but I think a few points speak for themselves:-The stand was easy to assemble, and the TV is so light (yet durable) that it was a snap to install by myself. It rotates easily and smoothly, and diffuses light off the screen (so you don't have to watch movies in total darkness for fear of glare on the screen).-From the first time starting up, the TV prompts you to pick out a few settings of your choosing. We have (limited basic) cable, so I went into the menus afterward and had the TV scan through all the available channels. Amazingly, this TV picks up more channels (including a bunch of digital channels) than another HDTV (a 4-year-old plasma) that we have in a separate room. The broadcast channels are fuzzy of course, but the HD channels look fantastic! Of course, I had to modify the picture and audio settings to really make things look and sound good, but once they were set, I knew this TV was worth it. It only took around a half hour of tinkering and I think I'm done for good (as opposed to the plasma, which still has issues). The settings are also independent for each source, so you can watch movies and play games knowing they look their best. As for sound, the speakers are decent, especially with the SRS turned on, but the bass output is limited, and even a 2.1 surround setup will sound much richer.-I have an HD DVD player hooked up via one of the HDMI ports, and have sampled a few discs in high-definition, but what really surprises me is how good regular DVDs look. True, they're \"upconverted\" by the player, but it's still a wonder how they can look so good. The latest one I watched was the Pixar movie Up, and it looked PERFECT...it was crystal clear, with vivid colors and a real sense of depth and scale. The Blu-Ray version may have a higher resolution, but I was more than happy with what I saw (and this is coming from someone who just bought a PS3).-EDIT: The only nagging issue I have with the TV is with \"ghosting,\" especially in dark scenes. This mainly seems to happen with HD channels and certain HD movies. For instance, I watched the HD DVD of Blade Runner, and at certain times (mainly during the chases through the dark city streets), there was a faint \"trail\" as the characters would turn their heads or run across the screen. I'm hoping this won't affect gaming on the PS3, but it is something to consider.-EDIT NEWS: The PS3 games and Blu-Rays look amazing and trouble-free. The ghosting only happens with certain (usually older) movies...I noticed it in Goodfellas and The Insider too. It's not a big deal, and only happens in dark scenes.-ADDITIONAL: Two other little things that bother me after having the TV for a month: When you turn it on, the red light goes dark and eventually comes back on, where I thought it should simply turn green. Also, the buttons on the remote don't glow in the dark, which would have been useful.", "Date": "January 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Everything has already been said about this...", "Author": "Yllabian Space Guppy", "ReviewID": "R222C6CITBFUVV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "...  except whenever possible, connect the set via an HDMI cable (even if you only have regular cable) as the picture improved dramatically.  I initially used coax but wasn't at all pleased with the picture quality.  Next I tried the component connections as I had a spare set of new cables handy and while the picture improved, it still wasn't all that great.  I took CNET's advice and bought an El Cheapo HDMI cable from Ebay ($4.15 shipped!) and then the set then came to life.  The picture quality is very nice now.  BTW: don't spend any more than $5 shipped for an HDMI cable, you're wasting your money (look on Amazon and Ebay -- they are a ton of them out there).We've had the set for a couple of weeks now and are enjoying the free space in the family room that the old 26\" CRT set and the old TV stand that it used to sit on occupied (the Samsung is mounted on the wall).  I see that Amazon has the set listed now at $399 with free shipping but when we got ours on Black Friday weekend, Best Buy had the best price I could find at $377.  My only gripe so far with buying from Amazon is that it takes them several days to get the order out the door.UPDATE: 02/24/10 - We've had this set for a couple of months now and it has been working great.  My only complaint so far is fairly trivial:  the remote control seems to have a very narrow window in which the set will detect the commands from the remote.  I am not sure if it's the TV or the remote itself that is the problem, but unless you are pointing the remote at a certain spot on the TV, it doesn't acknowledge the command(s).", "Date": "January 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "After doing a lot of research, I settled on this Samsung and absolutely love it.", "Author": "J. Pilares \"BiG JeEzY\"", "ReviewID": "R6I17F0E0O9R1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After weeks of research, comparing and contemplating all the various choices I had when it came to LCD TVs of this size and price range, I decided this Samsung was the one for me. I took it home, removed it out of the box, assembled it, turned it on and as I had expected, was really impressed by what this TV had to offer.The picture quality is absolutely amazing. Especially when watching any blu ray movie. It just looks so crisp, colorful and the image moves so smoothly. The picture on this 720p TV looks just as brilliant as a 1080p TV of the same 32 inch size. I have a Playstation 3 connected to the TV using a Mediabridge Ultra Series HDMI cable and am still astonished today by how all my videogames have never looked, felt, and sounded so good before. This TV definitely is excellent for playing videogames, especially with its exclusive \"Game Mode\" which makes the games move even more smoother and more life-like. Picture settings and sound settings are both fully customizable as well as feature preset settings. The TV has simple, easy to follow menu screens that only took me a few moments to navigate through and learn. The remote is also simple and easy to use.I only have two complaints about this TV and they are relatively minor. Firstly, while the sound from the speakers is plenty loud and life-like, I would have wanted the speakers to have a little more bass to them. At a few instances when watching regular TV programming, it sounds clear but at the same time does sound kinda flat. However, they sound great when playing movies and games through my Playstation 3. Lastly, the picture loses some of its color when viewing the TV from the side. The TV is in one corner of my room and I have it facing diagonally towards the center of my room. Meaning, I view it from the side on occasion. When I do, the color fades out a bit. I heard this is very typical of LCDs and do see the exact same thing with other brands as well.Some people will opt for the other, more expensive, 32 inch LN32B460 model also made by Samsung because that model has 3 HDMI outputs compared to 2 HDMI outputs on this TV. However personally, I only need 2 HDMI outputs, one being for my Playstation 3, the other for the cable box. So a third HDMI output was really unnecessary for me. Plus, I love the glossy all-black finish of this TV. The other model has a different finish.Overall, I give this TV a 9.8/10, which is the highest rating I've given compared to any other 32 inch LCD. I'm extremely happy and look forward to years and years of use from it and will purchase another Samsung TV in the future.

Picture is amazing in HD, especially watching the winter Olympics.Pros - Picture and the sound are great for what we are using it for. I'm not sure why others have commented on bad sound, it sounds good to us. The speakers are hidden on the bottom and face downward which is what we wanted since it makes the overall size smaller and cleaner looking. It's in the kitchen and we are not using it for movies. Mostly, just for sports and news. The colors are bright and crisp and the blacks are dark. Setup was simple and the remote and menus are easy to use.Cons - These are not cons for us since they did not change our decision to buy this TV. However I feel I should mention some of them. There are no connections on the side of the TV; all are located in the back. If you wall mount the TV this could be an issue if you wanted to easily connect a camera or other devices. We mounted on the wall, but used an articulating arm; this makes it easy for us to access the rear connections, we just swing out the TV. There are no USB or card slot for viewing pictures and no S-video. We are only using an HDMI cable which was not included. This TV comes with no cables which I found strange.

I was debating between this one and Sony KDL32L5000.  A deal at Crutchfield made me buy this one.  Compared to the Sony, this TV has one fewer component input.  But the input options are enough for most scenarios.  I connect a basic cable feed to the RF, a satellite receiver to the composite, a 3-year old DVD player to the component, and a laptop to the VGA, leaving the two HDMI inputs open.  (I am writing this review using the TV as monitor.)  The source cannot be 1080p, which might appear to be a shortcoming compared to the Sony.  But I don't have any 1080p source yet and when I have it in the future, I can always set it to output 1080i or 720p.  The video will be down-sampled to 768p anyway.I give 4 stars because this TV did not meet my expectations, which were based on my 46 inch 1080p Samsung and might be too high for a 720p.  Since the LCD has 768 rows, all 720p and 1080i sources are resampled.  There is no way to display a 720p source natively without pixel resampling.  This may be true for all 720p TVs with 768 rows.  For my 1080p TV, there is a \"just scan\" option for 1080i sources, which makes the source very crisp.  I thought this TV would have a similar option for 720p sources.  Actually it has a \"screen fit\" option for 1080i sources, which won't overscan and will display the full frame of the input, downsampled to 768p of course.  This feature probably is copied from Samsung's 1080p firmware but it would be great if 720p sources receive the same treatment.  After all, this is a \"720p\" TV.  In contrast, the laptop connection is crisp as there is no pixel resampling.These technical issues are barely noticeable when viewing from six feet away.  So for normal use, this TV is great.  The interface and settings are very similar to my other Samsung, which made it easy for me to get used to the new TV.Update 10/19/2009:  The \"Screen Fit\" option (i.e. no over scan but still resampling to fit 768 rows) is available only for HDMI (720p/1080i), Component (1080i) or DTV (1080i).  This is why I did not see this option for 720p DTV sources.  Even for HDMI input with 720p, you cannot see 1:1 pixel mapping.  Now I know why it is called \"screen fit\", not \"just scan\".  I guess I won't buy 720p TV (a.k.a. 768p TV) any more.", "Date": "August 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great for 2 years", "Author": "Andrew J.

We rarely had any issues with it until now. One day when we came home we were looking forward to just vegging on the couch to watch our program. Grabbed the remote and pressed the power button. The Direct TV console turned on followed by the familiar red light at the bottom center of the tv. This is usually followed by a distinct ringing beep that would indicate the power is turned on. There was no beep. No ring. No sound. No picture. Just pure black with the red power light winking at us. We tried everything to resurrect the picture including disconnecting the power cord and using different wall sockets. Nothing. I called Samsung worldwide and the service agent said that it is a service call issue however since we bought the TV on June 30 2008, we are no longer covered by the warranty as it is now August 2009. It amuses me how crap like this happens soon after the warranty runs out. I looked all over online and many Samsung owners of various models and sizes have experienced the same thing, a defective power supply and it will have to be replaced. I also looked to see if I could do it myself if I buy the part and save a little scratch. But it turns out that it involves using a soldering gun and having failed shop class, I figured I would call a professional. Repair will cost upwards of $250 including service call, parts and labor. Just when you think you're getting a bargain, just be aware that it could cost you in the long run.
