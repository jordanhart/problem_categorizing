{"Reviews": [{"Title": "In Depth Look at the Pros, Cons, and Expectations For the Hanspree 25\" HDTV", "Author": "Matthew A. Kirchner", "ReviewID": "RGR7JFKLTY6YF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had previously owned a 18.5\" 720p Sanyo HDTV and that suited my needs well. We also have many \"tube\" TV sets in our house. Well, my Fiance and I had decided to get a new TV for when we moved so I set out for the task at hand. Originally, I was looking for a 1080p, 32\" HDTV and most of what satisfied my TV requirements was $400-$700 (or more) dollars. In the end I had ordered an LG TV and cancelled that order. I just didn't want to risk the price. I decided to downgrade to a 25\" TV to cut the cost. And still what I was looking at was a good $250-$350, not to mention it isn't to easy to find a quality 1080p TV that small.  I stumbled across this Hanspree Television and had not noticed the price. However, it met all my requirements: Headphone jack, 2 HDMI ports, PC Capable, Game Compatible, etc. I was about ready to order when I saw the price... $179... and I stepped back. Like most thinks in the world, I thought it was too good to be true. How could this Hanspree be $100 cheaper than my Sanyo? I went to check the reviews again and sure enough, the only review there was, was in Spanish (which is why I'm writing THIS review).  So now I had nobody understandable's opinions to go by.  Well, I couldn't find anything negative on it or the company with what little information I could scrap up, so I pulled the most highly blind and rewarding move I've ever pulled in my history of online buying. I ordered the TV.  It is a 25\" TV with 24.6\" of usable TV screen.  Here is where it gets good. I clicked on Standard (5) day shipping. I got it on the 2nd business day. It arrived (via UPS ground) in extremely good packaging condition, aside from a small divot on the bottom of the box. It was packed in there tight, so I knew the TV did not bounce around in the box while shipping. I had difficulty getting the TV and Styrofoam out of the cardboard box, haha.  I was surprised to see it game with an HDMI cord (not gold plated), and of course, the remote had batteries. The remote has a decent amount of buttons and most of them I've figured out so far. However, instead of text for some buttons, there are pictures of that button's function; which is almost self explanatory, but if you can't figure it out there is a pretty hefty information manual shipped with the TV. [...also a plus]  The TV is no thicker than my 18.5\" (about 2-4 inches) and on the back there are 6, not 4, female mounting slots for wall mount compatibility. The stand came pre-assembled to the TV so I just pulled it out of the box and set in on my desk. The stand itself is sturdy enough but of course there is wobbling of the TV due to its narrow and tall nature. This cannot be fixed as it will happen with all \"larger\" flat screen TV's on a stand.  The front has a glossy finish that shows dust easier, but I don't give a rat's behind. Its seven and a half seconds to wipe it off, I'm not THAT lazy. There are Power, Channel, Volume, Input, and Menu buttons on the TV's left hand side. (Facing the screen , they are to your right.) And There is Coaxial, Red-White-Yellow Audio/Visual, S-Visual, and 1 USB Port on the TV's right hand side. On the back you have 2 HDMI ports, more AV connections available, a Headphone Jack, PC Line-in, and PC connections for hookup as a computer moniter. (Maybe a little more, I'm going off of memory here.)  I have my TV connected to (gold plated)HDMI for picture and sound and the picture is fantastic! Its just like my father's 42\" $1,300 TV, if not better. It does run in true 1080p resolution. And the 60HZ refresh rate is a true 60HZ. There is no flaw or \"1920's film\" effect on screen smoothness. When playing on my Xbox in competitive 1st person shooters, I notice no screen lag. There seems to be 'no' delay in the time the TV can display its picture. So it holds true to its 2ms response time. I've ordered a Blue-Ray player and I will tell you how well it can handle that too. (You also have full menu customization options for the picture.)  The audio is no second runner. The speaker is an outward/frontward facing speaker placed along the length of the bottom of the TV. With noise cancelling headphones the TV can display sound in true surround sound. The effect is dampened with the removal of the headphones when playing over the TV speaker, as is with all other TVs. The sound quality/clarity is clear and forceful. (You also have full menu customization options for the sound.) And the balance of sound between channels seems to be pretty routine. No sudden bursts of loud that set the neighbor's dogs barking... yet. :)  However, I do have 1 quam about this TV's audio. Often, at night when the whole house is asleep, you need to put headphones in. The lowest volume besides off or mute, (volume \"0\" or zero), is volume \"1\". The lowest audible sound setting for this TV. And it is pretty loud. Not too loud but enough to be disturbing to your sleeping partner or someone in the immediate next room. Volume \"1\" runs at about a normal-low talking voice decibel and CANNOT go any lower. I believe the TV was meant for more spacious rooms than my own and despite this, I will not return this TV for anything. It is not a big enough problem to warrant the loss of a star.  Regardless, the initial set up is pretty straight forward, fast, and easy. I mean it was printed on laminated paper in \"Step 1, Step 2, Step 3\" format as well as having on screen instruction. The paper says the end of setup comes with scanning the channels for the TV so you \"must\" have the TV hooked up to a cable or wireless source but I'm here to tell you that does not matter. On my first initial setup of the TV I only had it hooked up to my Xbox and it told me it couldn't find channels and I hit \"ok\" and that was the end of that. My \"second\" initial setup came when I hooked it up to cable and it worked fine too.  The menu is easy to pull up. Just hit \"Menu\" on the remote or TV and there you are. It is extremely to navigate these shallow yet expansive menus.All in all the only con I have about this TV is the volume doesn't go \"low\" enough. But with that, it still turns pretty low and I have headphones so its not a biggy.I have never regretted buying this TV... especially for $179.00. Thank you Amazon!~Sincerely, the guy who will forever give you his money :)=============================================================================================================================UPDATE:  I have the Blue-Ray player and the picture is outstanding! Worked flawlessly with the TV! The picture, I've never seen anything like it :) I'm a happy man. This TV's compatibility with Blue-Ray is something that my friend's don't even get too well with their setup. [But don't quote me on it, haha.]  I'd like to note, however, that the TV stand does not allow the TV to tilt or pivot on an axis or any point of rotation. It is a fixed stand.UPDATE (10/24/2011):  The TV is still going strong and the picture quality is still excellent;nevertheless, I've had NO problems thus far. I'd like to make a note, however, that when turning the TV on it does take about 3-4 seconds of its time to display the HANNSPREE logo on screen then another 1-2 seconds at \"Signal In Progress\" while it loads the initial image onto the TV. So if you panic while playing a competative game or watching a movie and somehow shut the TV off, there may be a 6 or so second wait to regain the image.  Also, when the AA batteries for another device went \"dead\" just a week after I got the TV, I put those \"dead\" batteries in this TV's remote because I knew it would take less battery to operate it than the device they were initially in... these \"dead\"  batteries are still running strong months later. This remote won't run you through batteries.  The PC hookup is nice. I spent 8 hours the other night with my uncle fixing an old Dell Dimension B110 Desktop so it would run well. (And I mean 128 megabytes of RAM Memory old.) I'm typing on this computer now and it is running exceptionally fast. The reason I say this is because this computer is also hooked up to this TV with an old PC Line-In connection. There was nothing to setting up a computer with this. I connected the PC Line-In cord to the TV and the computer, plugged the PC into an outlet, plugged in a wireless connection, and turned it on. Everything ran smoothly. So it does work extremely well with a PC.  Also, might I add to the person disappointed with the picture. To get full 1080p resolution on any 1080p TV, you need to run a Blu-ray disk in a Blu-ray player. THAT will display full 1080p resolution at the 10,000:1 contrast ratio. Watching television programs does not. Television programs, no matter how HD they may seem or promise can only be displayed on any TV at the 1080i resolution. Which technically means you get less picture quality because it refreshes the pixels every other \"frame\" [than normal]. Blu-rays can display 1080p, so it is not limited to the 1080i screen resolution that you get from every cable/satellite provider. Also 1080p DVD's do not have as pristine a picture quality as Blu-rays, so that could also be a hindering factor.  Otherwise, the headphone jack on the back of the TV works well however you have to be careful. Where I would say normal listening volume for this TV (for me) is no higher than 23 through the speakers, when the headphones are plugged in you need a volume of anywhere from 45-60 to be able to get the same decibel sound. So the TV, in a sense, has to be much louder with the headphones in [to be all around quieter for other people because there are headphones in]. So be careful you don't accidentally yank the cord out when listening with headphones, it may suddenly blast the room with loud noise from the speakers, waking those around you *hint hint*.", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic TV & Monitor!", "Author": "Jesse M", "ReviewID": "R10SP2I8CYEQS7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is currently being used as both an HDTV and a computer monitor through HDMI. Setup is a cinch! I'm always hesitant to buy TVs online, mostly because I'm picky about volume and sound. This TV has amazing sound. Surpasses anything I've used before this for my bedroom TV and computer monitor. It's nice having one display be able to work flawlessly as both.Blu Rays are amazing to watch on this, too.I'm a gamer, and I have yet to have any issue with this TV while playing all of my games on maxed settings. Settings and resolution are only limited by your graphics card, really. In the past, I've used TVs as monitors, and it's always the same problem: adjusting the screen to fit correctly and getting the correct resolution. This TV is truly \"Plug n Play.\" I've never had to adjust anything.One last thing. There is no glare from light sources. Maybe this is a feature of LCDs, but in respect for this one, it's fantastic not to have to worry about placement in regards to lights and windows.", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "IF YOU ARE A GAMER (MLG OR GAMEBATTLES) OR JUST LIKE TV.", "Author": "Corey-E \"Corey\"", "ReviewID": "R2SYGXUQ8B7SRW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is 2ms which is the fastest response time for a TV.

Setup was easy enough.  The picture was not as bright as I expected.  I had to remove a bulb from a ceiling fixture because it was too bright around the TV and made it really difficult to see.  Sound quality was marginal at best.  The real killer though, was that it only lasted 2 years before I had picture difficulties.  Today, after the unit was on for about 10 minutes, the screen went black.  I turned the unit off and let it set for about 10 minutes before turning it back on.  The picture came back for about a minute.Waste of money at half the price.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Happy Customer", "Author": "Not Impressed", "ReviewID": "R3CINGDOHBXDBQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice TV for a good price.

I'm very familiar with front of screen performance and test methods for evaluating such.This was purchased as a refurb from another vendor, a decision made primarily on price, secondarily on reviews here and on other sites.  In my eyes, it's a terribly over-hyped TV; the biggest issue being the narrow vertical and horizontal viewing angle which makes for poor performance on a kitchen counter.  While I'm not a fan of LCD TVs in general, a friend's pricier LG was much better on the vertical plane and would have been a better choice.Also, the on-screen display doesn't shrink in size when doing custom picture adjustments, preventing one from seeing what they're doing.  In the end, getting a good, clear and artifact free picture was not achievable.  Few LCDs below 37\" have good viewing performance, something Consumer Reports has verified repeatedly and I just confirmed with this piece of crap.Last, it was missing the HDMI cable and batteries for the remote, and my FiOS remote does not contain Hannspree codes (nor do many other universal remotes), meaning you need to keep the Hannspree remote handy for many functions.In summary, great price and decent sound, but I'd only recommend to someone who has never seen a good HD picture.
