The tv just arrived today. I was quite pleased with the tv. The picture is vivid and the sound is excellent for such a thin tv. I purchased the tv for my home office and upgraded from an older 23\" Samsung tv which actually took up more space due to its side mounted speakers. If you are looking for a 26\" tv, I feel that it was worth the extra $$$ to get this LED model. This was my first LED tv. The picture is great and it only uses 40 watts of electricity. My old 23\" Samsung used 100 watts. I hooked up the coaxial cable wire to the tv directly and it found all of the analog and digital channels within a few minutes on auto mode. I also hooked up my PS3 via HDMI and it worked right away (The other reviewer wrote about his HDMI cable not producing sound.- Possibly he was using a defective HDMI cable or he had an audio output setting set incorrectly on the device that was connected to the tv...... because the HDMI output works fine on this tv). The only negative is that the tv display is 720p/1080i. The tv does not have 1080p but in all honesty on a tv less than 40\" you really don't need 1080p. Final verdict- Pricey but worth it.... if this is the size you're looking for. I only wish that I had room for the 32\" model. Don't just take my word for it....the tv keeps selling out on Amazon as soon as it comes back in stock.", "Date": "March 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not Samsung's usual quality.", "Author": "Jayson Allyson \"Spaztik\"", "ReviewID": "R1PLH1NC2HQBCQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Let me just say that I was really excited to get this TV. So excited that I simply forgot to check the pixel response time before I went to purchase it. When I hooked my PS3 up to this TV via HDMI, I noticed horrible ghosting. This is not a fast display. If you're going to be doing any type of gaming on this display, I would go with something else. Then, after I saw how bad the ghosting and overdrive was, I immediately went online to try to find out what the response time was and what do you know... there's no response time listed for this model on ANY website. Even the websites that list response time put \"N/A\" in that section. Do yourself a favor and make sure you know the response time of your TV before you buy it. If it doesn't list a response time, you're probably in for trouble.I also purchased the new 32\" LN32C530 and that screen also had the same horrible ghosting... again, no response time listed anywhere that I could find.In conclusion, I was not happy with the performance of this monitor. If you want to go ahead and order it anyway, that's your call, but I'm just putting the warning out that if you don't like ghosting or overdrive, do not buy this. You'll be disappointed. Note: I also saw a lot of ghosting in movies too.", "Date": "March 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Big Sky Country", "ReviewID": "R1MZ5CTVNKMFQX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Overall a great little TV.

Varilone", "ReviewID": "R4WLY1ZFQYJJR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The picture is great, the sound is good, no complaints at all.The only thing I want to draw people's attention to is the fact that this, unlike almost all other 26\" TVs, requires M8 screws to mount it to a VESA wall mount. These are very large screws that you would usually find on larger TVs. This wouldn't be a big deal if most wall mounts for 26\" TVs had big enough holes to accomodate this, but in my case (I purchased the VideoSecu wall mount) the holes were not large enough.I had to run out and buy M8 x 25mm screws, and drill bigger holes into my wall mount bracket. I used the grey spacers from Samsung to attach it to the bracket. It works great now, very secure, I just want to make sure people are aware they might need to do a couple of extra steps if they would like to wall mount this TV.", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Below par picture quality and on/off timer cannot use HD source", "Author": "Just a guy", "ReviewID": "R335ZYLPP1GVAR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If you want a very thin TV for a bathroom or bedroom, this is probably fine - with a few caveats.The screen is very clear and sharp when watching network news or anything that doesn't include much movement.Once you get much movement, this screen shows it huge weakness.  There is something called \"ghosting\" (I believe I am using the correct term).  That is, when someone is running across the screen it is as if they leave a wake.  This is especially evident on channels (CNBC) where there is a scroll at the bottom.  I guess this is a function of the refresh rate - which is listed as 60Hz.Also, when you first get this the picture settings are crazy oversaturated - but those can be fixed.However, my biggest gripe is with respect to the on/off timer.  It seems that the on/off timer only lets you select from two sources (1) TV - which only includes things connected through the coax connection; and (2) USB - a thumb drive.  It does not let you select the HDMI input.  This is silly.  99% of people hook up their HD set to a cable/satellite box using HDMI cables.  This limitation in the TV's firmware effectively prevents someone from using the on/off timer for a HD source.  I have confirmed with Samsung support (and the owner's manual) that this is a limitation.  I specifically bought this for my bedroom to use as an alarm clock.  I thought I would be able to set this up to turn the TV on in the morning and it would pop on to the cable box (which is always on).  It won't do that because the cable box is connected over HDMI.  This is the dumbest limitation on earth.On the plus side, it comes with a nice stand, great instructions and has a very nice form factor.  The menus are pretty self explainatory.  Someone in another review complained about HDMI not giving them audio - they must have hooked it up wrong.  I get audio and video over HDMI from my Fios HD box.Three stars because of very poor HD picture quality and because someone seriously screwed up when designing the on/off timer source selections - hopefully this can be addressed in a firmware update.", "Date": "June 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "A real Whopper of a TV", "Author": "The Car Keeper", "ReviewID": "R2I4B8AXZCDY77", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ordered this TV over a month ago and it was delivered fast!  What a TV indeed! I had seem this TV in a store, right next to a LCD unit of the same size. It was obvious that this LED model definately had a much sharper picture. It made a believer out of me right away and I'm also amazed by how thin it is! In addition, I would also rate the sound as fair/good, with no serious complaints that I can find. To me, LED sets are the better by far!  Highly recommend this one to anyone needing this size. It doesn't take up much space!", "Date": "September 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Phenomenal tv and monitor!", "Author": "Burcu", "ReviewID": "R2VYV21ILBBRI0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use this for both as a tv and a pc monitor and I have to say that it is truly exceptional. The picture quality is outstanding. Its menu is also very extensive which is a plus (because you can customize it). I put on some bunny ears to see how the free over the air channels would work, and the picture was really fuzzy like I was watching analog again or something...but that could have been because of the antenna...I plan on buying a new one and seeing how it works..Setting the tv up on the stand also was a bit challenging because the instructions are VERY vague...it basically leaves you to your own imagination. I had to have someone help me and it still took us at least an hour to figure everything out when if the instructions were better...it would have only taken maybe 10 minutes. I also noticed the turn on time is a bit slow.  It takes about 10 seconds I would say...and that sounds fast...but just count it out loud and then you will know what im talking about. The clear bezel really adds a sense of classiness and slickness to it and so does the touch sensitive buttons. The slimness makes it very light so I can move it around my desk with ease. It doesn't swivel but it makes up for that in its lightness because you can just slide it yourself which ever direction you want it. Over all though I am very pleased with my transaction.", "Date": "July 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Samsung TV", "Author": "Sarahakilishek \"sally kilishek\"", "ReviewID": "R2JK16O3KPIRWL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A good product, neatly packaged and well performing.

There is noconsistance rhythm of when this happens. Best buy useless tech squad couldn't figure it out so sent it out to be fixed. They called and said it would cost 495.00 to fix it. He wasn't sure what it is, but by replacing this part it would eliminate the problem. He said the shop was filled with these samsung tv's having this on/off issue. Tv cost me 549.00. He told me of course it is not worth fixing.Sanmsung claimed they have never heard of this issue, but google the issue and see how many hits you get.  Samsungs customer service was terrible...as was Best Buys. The tech (Wilson) that best buy sent it to down in chino, California said that samsung is well aware of this issue. He told me it was a common complaint. What i don't understand is as common as it is....why don't they know exactly what it is and have an easier fix for it...or a recall.", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV average sound", "Author": "harleypsychRN \"dennisb643\"", "ReviewID": "R3DZM0GZ0Y5V39", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought two other Samsung TV's in the past two years for different rooms of my house; one 52\" LCD for the bar and one 46\" LED for the living room. The picture quality of the LED is far superior to the LCD, so when it came time to replace my Insigna 23\" LCD in the bedroom, I opted for the 26\" Samsung LED. Hooked it up today and wow! Great picture (as usual) and average sound (as usual). The 4 year old Insigna LCD actually had a better sound than the Samsung, but of course the picture quality is far far superior. I guess that's why Samsung makes sound bars.
