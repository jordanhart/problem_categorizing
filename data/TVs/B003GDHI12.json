{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Picture", "Author": "Hunter Blackstone", "ReviewID": "R27HORF6MRS74B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have had this TV for three weeks. It replaces a Vizio 50\" Plasma purchased 4 years ago that died.- Picture quality is outstanding. Very dark black with no visible back-lighting. NFL games and fast-action video work great. Side-angle viewing is good with this TV.- Tons of inputs.- Vizio Support answers the phone promptly. They're helpful and courteous.- Excellent matte screen surface with little to no glare from lamps, windows, and doors. Because of the matte finish, we opted to move our TV location perpendicular to a an 8ft sliding glass door out to the pool. We have had no problems with light or glare degrading picture quality. In contrast, this door would have caused extreme glare on the slick surface of the plasma, while also washing out the picture.- Internet Aps are handy. Neflix is the one we use primarily. Because the TV is now the sound source, an Optical Cable is needed for connection to the Receiver. Once setup, sound and picture quality are outstanding. Getting to a list of movies with the VIA button on the remote takes only a couple of clicks. The NetFlix ap works so well, we barely use our media computer hooked up to the system.- Remote Control and TV Setup menus on the unit are intuitive, easy to use, and graphically well done. The TV picture quality was great for us out of the box, requiring no adjustments. Remote control setup via the on-screen configuration automatically tries codes and only requires the user to click \"worked\" / \"didn't work\" in order to cycle through and find the right code. Best remote setup I've ever seen.- Remote Control itself is nearly perfect. Well-spaced buttons that are easy to read and arranged logically and in similar locations to other DVR's. Physical size is ideal, Not too long like many remotes. Keyboard flip out is a fantastic addition.- TV mounts to a wall without any problems. (We used the Vizio XMA 1200--worst user manual I've ever encountered) The unit is surprisingly light, given the TV's size. Still best to have two people when hanging the unit on the wall.- Because our previous Vizio died after only 4 years, we bought a 4-year Square Trade warranty from Amazon (STAY AWAY FROM ALL WARRANTIES BY THE COMPANY \"NEW\"). Our Sams Club warranty was through NEW. A month of being hassled resulted in our TV being picked up and taken to a local shop. After another 10 days NEW gave us an undetermined ETA on Parts for the repair. We called SAMS CLUB and explained our warranty nightmare. Sams Club Manager told me to bring in the TV. NEW Refused to give the TV back. I found a phone number to the shop they contracted out and was able to get a address, then go pickup the TV myself. Sams Club gave us a full-refund! Avoid NEW (read reviews here on Amazon of New Warranties). Vizio also offers a similarly priced warranty extension. There is paperwork in the box for purchasing this product from Vizio.- We're very happy with the TV.Update 3/16/2011We've had this TV now for approximately 6 months and are still happy with it. However, one complaint: I notice on very black screens where there is a an object that is brightly colored, you will see haloing. For example, credits on a movie where the screen is black and the text is white will show haloing around the text. Another example, the moon against a black background will have haloing. Seems to be a panel lighting issue. This issue can detract from your viewing experience in these high contrast scenarios.", "Date": "September 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Picture Quality, Features, and Customer Service!!!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1Y68XNWKQPA6N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all my review is solely for the TV itself, and not Amazon, since we purchased this TV at Wal Mart. - Start up and Set up -With so many features offered I thought this TV might be overwhelming to set up out of the box - it ISN'T.  It walks you through step-by-step on things such as synching up the remote with your cable/satellite box, receiver, setting up the network to use the \"WIDGETS\" (or apps), etc.  I was up and running literally within 10 minutes. - Picture Quality -The picture qualioty is AMAZING.  I Googled \"XVT553SV picture settings\" and used the settings found on a CNET discussion board [...], but added my own tweaks such as I turn the back light up some, and for my XBOX 360 input I turn color enhancement on \"normal.\"  The colors are very rich, the black levels are AMAZING so long as you've got the Smart Dimming turned on, and there is little, if any, \"blocking\" or pixelation when there is fast moving scenes like waterfalls, or explosions on movies. - \"Smart Dimming\" local dimming -While the picture is certainly great, it has some flaws.  There is some \"blooming\" or whitish halos around white objects that are against black backgrounds.  I only see this on slow, or fixed screens such as when changing inputs and there is an all black screen with a \"No Input Selected\" white message in the middle of the screen.  It is also more evident as the viewing angles get wider.  Evidently this is a by product of local dimming (Smart Dimming) but in all honesty I NEVER notice this when watching TV, playing video games, or watching movies.  You quickly notice how BLACK the screen can be.  I have an LCD 1080p TV and a DLP 720p TV and neither come close to the black levels on this Vizio with its Smart Dimming turned on.  When the screen goes black it looks like the TV is OFF!  Not so with the Smart Dimming turned off. - Smooth Motion Feature -With ANY 120hz TVs (this is truly a 120hz TV with a scanning back light creating a \"240hz\" like affect) the \"smooth motion\" feature can make cinematic shows/movies look strange.  It has been described widely as \"The Soap Opera\" effect, and it makes even wonderfully filmed/edited shows/movies look as if filmed with a camcorder.  Camera panning looks wobbly, peoples' movements are super smooth, but it really looks like you are there while filming, which is NOT good.  Simply turn off the Smooth Motion feature if watching anything such as movies, or movie-like TV shows that are not reality TV, etc.  Sports look AMAZING with Smooth Motion turned on high.  Animation and CGI animated shows/movies look AMAZING with Smooth Motion turned on. - Gaming on the Vizio -I play an XBOX 360 console, and with some types of TVs delay can be evident when playing.  Not with this Vizio.  I play lots of first person shooter games, music type games requiring perfect timing for inputs from musical instrument type controllers, and motion-based Kinect games which also require perfect timing.  Everything runs smoothly on this TV.  The picture quality is the best I have EVER seen when playing XBOX 360 of any TV I've seen/owned. - Sound -Surprisingly such a thin set of speakers sound pretty darned good.  I personally turned my speakers off, and I use the Vizio remote (I'll get to the remote itself) to adjust the volume on my receiver and use the larger speakers.  This not only gives me better quality, but it saves me from blowing out the small Vizio speakers down the road like one of my other flat panel TVs has in the past. - Inputs -Inputs are abundant with this Vizio, with HDMIs dominating.  I know component cables are on their way out, but only having ONE component in (the 5 wire input with red/green/blue video and white/red audio) might require one to buy a switching device that takes one component in and turns it into three such as the one in this link [...]which can be $45.00 or more depending on quality.The ability to custom name inputs (rather than having generic \"game\" or \"cable\") is a nice touch.  You can have \"Cable Box\" or \"Direct TV\" or \"XBOX360\" or \"PS3\" etc. etc.  For those that have literally 5 HDMI devices plugged in it keeps things much more organized in the menus. - Remote Control -This might be a polarizing topic for this TV.  I LOVE the remote.  It does feel slightly \"cheap\" due to the slide-out portion not really staying 100% solid when not in use, but it doesn't bother me.  The remote being bluetooh enables one to control the TV without pointing anywhnere near the TV, in fact, I can control the TV in another room altogether if desired.  The remote also linked to my cable box and stereo receiver in a very simple menu that asks \"what model\" you have, then it auto scans and asks you to perform a funtion for the device, then click \"yes it worked\" or \"try next code\" and mine both worked on the first try.The slide out QWERTY keyboard is not PERFECT, but it's great.  The top row of buttons can be obstructed by the fixed portion of the remote, but it's better than not having a QWERTY keyboard at all.  It seems like a NECESSITY when using WIDGETS/apps such as Facebook, Twitter, Netflix (makes searching easier) etc. - Widgets/Internet Apps -What can I say?  I don't know how we did without these before.  Right out of the box we have Yahoo! news, weather, sports, fantasy football (updates stats real-time while watching TV), Pandora internet radio, Blockbuster on Demand, Hulu Plus, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon movies on demand, and TONS more.  I can check my local weather, or any number of custom-set cities around the world.  It's funny to ask XBOX friends in England how they're enjoying their current conditions when we chat.After another firmware update (second one since Christmas) we not only have MORE Widgets, but the interface for existing ones (Netflix for one) has been improved upon.  It's nice to know that they aren't resting on their laurels when it comes to the apps.The wireless connection is STRONG.  It auto detected our wireless network, and it works so well I've not yet climbed in the attic to run a dedicated ethernet cable to the TV as I'd planned to.  I can stream Netflix as smoothly (maybe better?) then I can with my ethernet-wired XBOX 360!!!  I have not had it slow/pause a movie/playback due to internet/connection speed yet!  This is also on a wireless G router too, and not the fancier N router.***WARNING ABOUT THIRD PARTY/INDEPENDENT APPS!!!***I have discovered that at least one third party, independent app was causing my TV to shut itself off and cause it to go in a \"standby\" mode.  The entire issue is explained in the next section.  I would steer clear of any apps not made by big companies.  The exact app name is \"1337 Pwn\" and it's published by a company called BrickSimple. - Problems and Vizio's customer service -With all of the great things I've said about this TV, it did have a few bugs to work out.  First of all the TV would shut itself off after 10:00pm (hey that's what it did!) and then the Vizio logo would flash orange/white just as it does when it receives a firmware update.  After a few days of this I was about to exchange the TV for another just like it, but decided to contact Vizio customer support first.  Through a series of messages with a REAL PERSON in a real time chat on Vizio's website, we set up a phone call with a \"Level 3\" tech to see if we could fix the issue.  We did a \"memory clear\" procedure and the problem was FIXED.  A real human being in AMERICA that spoke perfect English helped me not only fix the issue, but also walked me through resetting all my settings AND told me about some features I didn't know about.***UPDATE***I believe I have found the true source of my shutting down problems - BAD THIRD PARTY APP!!!It was only AFTER I added a third party app for monitoring XBox Live friends (The exact app name is \"1337 Pwn\" and it's published by a company called BrickSimple) did the TV have the shutting off issues.  I was able to figure this out when I finally re-added this exact app to the TV (I never added it after \"fixing\" the TV with Vizio Tech on the phone) this week, and what do you know?  Random shutting off with the flashing Vizio logo!  I deleted the app, and once again TV works perfectly as it should.  When Vizio Tech walked me through the rest it deleted any apps not already on the TV, the XBox one included.  THAT is why it \"fixed\" the TV! - OVERALL -I could not be happier with this purchase.  I know nobody likes to spend lots of money only to say how crappy the product was, but if I were not 100% satisfied with this Vizio XVT553SV I would have easily exchanged it for something else.  The fact is I cannot think of any other TV that offers the same features, picture quality, etc. for the price.  Some top level plasmas might do the trick, but they put off more heat, and suck much more power.  If this Vizio lasts for YEARS without issues I could call it the PERFECT TV, and would absolutely buy more Vizio TVs in the future.", "Date": "January 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "This thing rocks!!!", "Author": "D. Lindsey", "ReviewID": "RJVN97C5HB6G0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is amazing. The only thing more incredible is the bargain. I have been shopping flat screens for about a year now. I almost pulled the trigger on a Samsung C8000 until I came across this TV. You get everything Samsung has to offer minus the 3D which, for me, is still too new to invest in. This model boasts a 10,000,000 to 1 Dynamic Contrast ratio compared to Samsung's 8,000,0000. Blu-Ray (Sony BDP-570) looks and sounds spectacular. DirecTV HD shines as well. The set-up was a breeze. The only problem I encountered was the actual wait-time to get this thing. It took about three weeks since it was on pre-sell. However, once it was released, the shipper contacted me and I had this thing in my house three days later. If you want a TV packed full of features that you can actually enjoy but don't want to drop $3,000....this is your set. Pair this thing up with a decent home theater (I have the Sony HTSS370-It blows us out of the living room.) and you will truly be able to enjoy movie night at the house! I can't wait for College/NFL football to crank up! Vizio has stepped it up big time with the new XVT series!!!", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "*Update* It is being shipped back!!!", "Author": "A/V Man", "ReviewID": "RGLGA8S62QDLF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This TV is very nice. The picture quality is outstanding. The features are amazing and overall the quality and feature set of this set rivals many of the bigger TV manufactures (Sony, Samsung, LG, and Panasonic). I have a very bright room and the anti-reflective coating really does stop the glare. I am super happy with the purchase and Amazon rocks. The guys who delivered the set were a bit sloppy, but everything arrived on time and in good working order. My only complaints about the set are the lack of an LCD screen on the remote (so you know which source it selected) and I wish the lighted logo could be turned on or off. Otherwise it is a great set with tons of features!!!*Update 1*I do love the set but it is going back. 1st being that is freezes constantly. I had it freeze 5 times in 5 days. Not good. each time requires me to unplug the unit for 1 min. Plug it back in and wait another minute while it re-boots. This is not good because it is in a TV console and is difficult to reach around to remove the power as the stand doesn't rotate. 2nd, I noticed a pink outline around 10-15 pixels wide and 2-4 pixels high that will not go away. It can be seen up close or is really dark scenes. Knocking the set down 2 stars for this. I am so bummed as I really love this set. I may wait for a newer production unit or pick up a CCFL LG. Amazon is currently out of stock. Sorry Vizio, I tried...*Update 2*Picked up a LG 55LD520 and love it. I really was not sold on LED back-lit sets yet. I think the nano led back-lit TVs will be much better. This CCFL LG has an incredible image and much better screen uniformity. No blooming whatsoever. The colors are spot on. I will miss some of the features of the Vizio, but the LG turns on fast and doesn't freeze. I am really impressed with the image quality of the LG. I saved hundreds of $$$ over the Vizio as well.

News channels like fox news and cnn look great on this set as well.  I love all the features you can use from the wi-fi capibility.  You can download different games and other widgets including streaming netflix directly to your set and the quility is very good (I have xfinity from comcast, you probably need a high speed connection to make use of this).  The remote control for this tv has to be one of the best designed remotes out there.  You can easily program all your devices just from selecting the brand of each (no need for entering codes).  Plenty of HDMI outlets for all my toys.  My PS3 looks AWESOME on this screen.  I'm not big into surround sound, the built in speakers seem fine to me, but I'm not an expert on sound as its not that important to me, since i live in a condo.  I shopped around everywhere and this model was easily the best bang for your buck, other with 55\" 240hz and 1080P were all about 800-1000 dollars more.  I bought mine at BJ's which had the best price around.

We visited retail stores to look at many TVs and to ask hundreds of questions about every detail regarding bright room viewing. We placed this Vizio in our family room that has skylights and wrap around windows. The picture is amazing in full sunlight. The matte screen prevents any glare. This is the best picture I have seen in any venue, whether home theater setting or brightly lit home setting. I set the TV up myself within twenty minutes. The setup guide comes right through the TV. Just plug it in and follow instructions.This model lives up to the top ratings given by Cnet and other reviewing sites. There are many picture settings available, but I found that the presets for any sports are perfect. I watch every sport and this model has presets that really enhance football, basketball, golf and baseball. We have had the set for about a month and the internet connectivity has been a real plus. We use Vudu and Amazon for HD downloads and probably will not buy a blueray player since we can get blueray over the internet through the apps that come preloaded on the TV.If you are looking for the best fully backlit LED TV on the market, you could pay thousands more for a Samsung or LG that is only comparable to the Vizio.

I finally pulled the trigger on this one, about 2 weeks ago.  It arrived today.  I tuned it with settings I found online.  This thing, besides being huge, looks great.  I replaced my LVM-42w2 with this one; the old 42 is relegated to my bedroom.  CNET, and a few other sites, called this one the current (11/12/2010) best picture quality.  I have spent a lot of time in my local (NYC) electronics stores looking at Sharps, LGs, Samsungs, and Sony tvs.  None have a better picture quality.  I'll agree that all the others look better on the outside, but the screen is great.Better than those others, this one's screen has a matte finish.  The matte finish reflects a lot less light, and less clearly, than the other brands I mentioned.  The others looked like mirrors, whereas this one reflects images much more blurredly.  Reflections are weak and not clear.Widgets are good and work snappily.  Netflix, using the wired connection, looks better than on the Wii; the Wii uses Wifi, and is connected to my TV via component video; so the direct Netflix Ethernet connection should be faster for both types of reasons.Overall, I am very happy with this new giant monster in my living room.  I can't wait to watch sports on it this weekend.Bought it here at Amazon.  Shipping took about 9 days from order date.  Box was well handled, and in good shape.

I remember doing months worth of research on various TV's and comparing prices from all over before finally deciding to buy a \"37 Vizio LCD back in 2007.  This TV was the same - lots of research and finally deciding to buy this one.  I couldn't be happier.  Having never owned an LED TV I was a little nervous but was pleased as always with my new Vizio purchase.  The delivery was not the fastest (courtesy of Pilot) but they were very friendly and helped me set it up on a stand and check that it was functioning properly.The TV itself is surprisingly light for the overall size.  The picture is phenominal - crisp and clear for my 1080 HD TV and Blu-Ray player.  I was also impressed by the sound quality from the TV itself.  It isn't superb but for the size of TV and the room it is in (22' x 18') it fills the room nicely.  The remote itself is OK - the pull out keypad is nice but frankly I don't use the Internet on the TV.  It would be nice if it was backlit but such is life.  The TV has quite a few input jacks and I can't think of anything it is missing feature-wise.

I contacted customer support and their level 3 technician walked me through a set of steps that involved 1 finger in my left ear and my right foot on black while holding three fingers on my right hand up to the sky ...... This cleared up the problem and the tech said that it shouldn't re-occur. I have not had the problem again. I've had some issues with the wireless-N wifi as well.

I would recommend this set to others as it has an awesome feature set and picture quality at a cost much lower than other brands.

The positive review in Consumer Reports gave us the final \"push\" to make the decision, and we also purchased the SquareTrade coverage as insurance.  The TV arrived in record time, was a snap to set up, and we couldn't have been more pleased with the picture quality, viewing angles and on-board sound.  2 weeks into use, however, the TV went into an endless bootup sequence and wouldn't work.  Our first call was to Vizio Tech Support.  They were friendly and  indicated they would need to dispatch a technician to inspect the unit, although they were somewhat vague on when that would occur.  To make sure all the bases were covered, we also called SquareTrade and were surprised to hear that even though we had a four-year policy, there was nothing they could do to get us back in business.  \"You must work this out with the manufacturer as long as the unit is under warranty\" (so why is it that they say that coverage starts on Day 1?).  Our final call was to Amazon customer service, who immediately shipped a replacement unit at no cost.  The new unit arrived before the Vizio tech would have even come out for the initial inspection.  My wife and I are hopeful we experienced a once-in-a-blue-moon failure and that the basic unit is well engineered and reliable -- time will tell.

They don't rate the warranty or tech support on their though.  I ordered this TV from Amazon.com on 12/3/2010 and it was delivered on 12/8/2010.  I unpacked it and let it sit at room temperature for about 3 hours before turning it on for the first time.  The picture quality is fantastic and the WiFi hookup is simple and quick.  I was streaming Netflix in about 5 minutes.  Don't get your hopes up for the picture quality of Netflix though.  It's \"okay\", but not HD.After about 2 days, each time I turned the TV on for the first time of the day I noticed screen pixilation and there was no sound for the first minute or two.  After that minute or two the picture would get back to normal then the sound would crackle then finally get to normal.  I tested the next morning by turning on the TV and using a different component(Blu Ray Player) in a different HDMI input.  Same result.  About a week later I got the first \"freeze then shutdown\".  Yes, the screen literally froze in the middle of a football game, then went black, then the Vizio light blinked on and off about 6 or 7 times then the TV turned off.  It was annoying.Randomly there was a pink hue on the screen as well when first turned on.  After seeing the pink I did the power cycle(unplug for 30-60 minutes) and I haven't seen the pink screen since, but the initial daily picture and sound are still messed up, plus it froze and shutdown again last night and today.4 days ago I called Vizio Tech Support.  They opened a case and asked me for details and I asked what the next steps were.  They said they would send this to second level support.  After hearing nothing back for 2 days I called them and they asked me to fax my proof of purchase so they could proceed with service.  They got that and I asked what the next steps were AGAIN and NOW they said I needed to take a picture of the issue on the screen and email it to them.This is where I am right now.  At this point it's getting a little annoying.  I don't like jumping through hoops after spending this much money.  The people at Vizio are always nice, but so far I am completely unimpressed with how they respond to THEIR TV not working properly.  I am giving them one week to get someone out to fix it or send me a replacement before I lose my patience and just return to Amazon.  It's not Amazon's fault this TV is faultyI truly want to believe in Vizio products and support so I can recommend them to everyone, but they are making it difficult at the moment.  I will update once I hear back from Vizio.UPDATE 12/23/2010:  I got an email confirming they received my pictures.  They gave me a few things to do to see if it would work.  After doing a \"Clean Storage\" reset then reprogramming the TV the issue was still not fixed.  I called Vizio back and the first-level support guy talked to the third-level support guy and guess what they wanted.....MORE pictures.  At this point I told the poor guy how I felt about their support.  I asked him point blank how he would feel if he just spent $1500 on a TV that wasn't working correctly and had to call their tech support over 8 times in 4 days JUST to be told I had to send MORE pictures to prove what I have told them since day 1?  The poor kid said, \"Yeah, that would suck.\"  I asked him to have a manager call me back so I could talk to them.  Within 30 minutes a manager called me and said after reviewing the notes on the case I was put through more grief than I should have been.  At this point I told him I wasn't mad.  I was disappointed that I couldn't go to bat for Vizio.  I was counting on them to fix THEIR product, but in the end I couldn't take anymore hoop-jumping.  I called Amazon to ask them to send someone to pick up the TV.  I could have gotten a replacement, but I will not go through this again.  Case closed.  I am not bitter.  I truly wanted to write a good review about this TV and Vizio as a company.  I cannot recommend buying anything from Vizio because if something goes wrong they will not take the effort to make it right.For the love of God.  Please don't put yourself through this just to save a few bucks.  There is a reason these TV's are as inexpensive as they are and I had to find out the hard way.UPDATE 12/30/2010:  I bought a replacement Samsung PN58C550 58\" Plasma $200 cheaper than the Vizio 55\" LED and LOVE IT!

I got it from Sams, and quickly ran into a setup issue. The setup wizard asked what my cable source is: cable box or straight from wall. Mine is from a box, via coax, so I said box. Then it wanted me to specify the input, but the coax/rf input wasn't an option. I tried everything I could think of, then turned it off & waited for regular business hours to call Vizio. A friendly guy named Harley (speaking standard American English) walked me through the setup and all was well. The procedure, by the way, was complex enough I already forgot the steps! Minor issue, good support, satisfactory outcome.The next issue a week later was setting up a new Sony AV receiver, STRDH820. I picked this in part because it has ACR (audio channel return) meaning the TV can send audio back along the HDMI cable & you can use the receiver to get surround sound for the TV with only the HDMI cable. I am doing my best to eliminate as many wires as possible. I even ordered all new HDMIv1.4 cables that support Ethernet, 3D, and audio return. I wanted to make sure the cables are interchangeable in case I swap the cables around. I CHECKED ON VIZIO.COM TO MAKE SURE THE TV WILL SUPPORT ARC. It says ARC is supported on HDMI 1 only, you can verify this at \"[..] plus I saw it in at least one review.I spent a very long time trying to make this work, but finally called Vizio. They said no way, this TV doesn't output anything from the HDMI port, it's for incoming traffic only. (the reference to ARC on their website is a mistake, or so they say) They said use the RCA stereo out or Toslink optical to send the signal to the receiver. Back to Wally World to spend another $19 for fiber optic cable. I hooked it up, the AV receiver now runs the TV sound through the surround sound speakers. Guess what - the overall sound isn't as satisfying as the fake surround the TV creates through its own speakers, at least for the one sitcom I tried it on. I'll try tweaking things through the receiver when I have time. Moderate issue, OK support, marginally satisfactory outcome.Overall, the TV is great. the picture is beautiful. I still haven't tried it out with the Wii, I tested the Internet Apps and can't see any reason to get excited, but movies are great & TV is mostly great. ABC is on channel 3, the channel my cable box tunes through, and has some odd horizontal banding, but I'm 99% sure this is a cable system issue. Charter has always had goofy sound issues on FOX, and I think this is their fault also. It's so minor I don't know if it's worth the time to try & fix it.UPDATE - next afternoonAfter posting, I finished reading every single review here, and someone mentioned the Audio Return Channel issue, but said she solved it by adjusting the CEC settings. I looked at Vizios' info some more, and at other online resources, but saw nothing about it, so I entered the Vizio \"MENU\", then \"TV Settings\". The bottom choice is \"CEC\". Then I set \"CEC Function\" to \"ON\" and \"System Audio Control\" to \"ON\". The last item here was \"Device Discover\". When I entered this item the TV found my Sony AV receiver and Blu-Ray player, even though they were off. I turned the receiver on, then went through to the back of the TV & unplugged the Toslink optical cord, and in the menu I turned OFF the TV speakers. The sound is now coming through my surround sound system WITHOUT a separate audio channel, just like audio return is supposed to work. Mind you, Vizio swore this won't work with this TV, but what the heck.Too bad I already bought the optical cable. I'll put it in a box with my multiple RCA audio & video cables and my digital coax, and a couple hundred bucks worth of other adapters I bought when they seemed really important.", "Date": "April 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "So nice I bought two", "Author": "teddybarelover \"teddy\"", "ReviewID": "R1I9KT5PMSDIG2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First I am not rich so let me tell you how I came out purchasing two of these tvs. My mom 75 birthday was on Thanksgiving Day.

I use a TV to watch sports and some reality shows, and to play some DVDs for the kids. So take my opinions for what they're worth.This was my first HDTV purchase so I relied on reviews and recommendations from CNET, Amazon and Consumer Reports. CNET sold me on this TV and the one gripe they had (viewing angle) turned out to not be a problem for me. Ironically, Consumer Reports gave this TV a \"Very Good\" on viewing angle and I tend to agree.I never saw this TV until we uncrated it in our living room. I didn't want to be persuaded by the retail store conditions that tend to make everything look great.I have a large room with ceiling-to-floor windows across the entire west wall (ton of sun), opposite the TV location, and worried about reflection. The matte screen negates this effect almost entirely during the brightest of times of day. If I concentrate, I can make out a window or a lamp (at night). At all other times, there is no reflection at all.Set up was a breeze, even with connection to internet. Another reviewer said his didn't support WEP, but I had no trouble using WEP. Check your router.The picture is great from all angles and distances. We have a morning room that is offset by about 45 degress and twice the distance of regular viewing, and the picture looks just as good. Audio is what I would expect from a TV. I have an A/V tech coming today to mount on the wall and hook up all of my components - Devon receiver, Bose surround, LG Bluray and Wii - so audio options will increase.Some generic reviews about LCDs warn of bluing of the blacks, and of \"blooming.\" First, the blacks on this set are truly black - period. Secondly, there is a slight blooming during the credits of some movies, but I seem to only notice this when I am in the corner at about 45 degrees. The \"Smart dimming\" feature makes this a non issue for most settings.I didn't buy this TV for the internet apps, but found they are easy to access, limited in function. For example, yes, it has Facebook - no, you can't do everything you can online - pretty much limited to your Wall. Headline news/sports is nice for a quick check, and because we have a full home sound system, we use the internet radio and Rhapsody (subscription required) apps daily. With the combination of wireless components I can get pretty much everything I want from my TV. If I need something else, my laptop is 5 feet away.The remote is not intuitive and has no backlighting. I'm sure some of this comes from me using the same cable universal remote for years. For one thing, it feels like youre holding it upside down, and when you look, the logo is at the bottom, not the top. This usually results in me changing the channel when I am trying to adjust the volume. Another problem is that while it does operate the cable box (setup's a breeze) it doesn't allow access to the full program description. The QWERTY keyboard is nice, but in the hands of a fidgeting 8 year old, I fear it won't be long for this world. We use the cable remote for daily watching and leave the Vizio remote on table for VIA access and input changes.When pricing this TV, I didn't want to spend $1,000 to get \"almost\" everything I wanted when I could spend $1,498 and get \"exactly\" what I wanted. I don't know if this means I got a \"good deal\" or not, but I am satisfied with what I got for what I paid. While Sam's Club still lists this price, good luck finding one at a club. They're out, or have a floor model available.Finally, we've had many friends over since the purchase and they are all amazed at the picture. Even my techie friend with the Sony plasma was pointing out all the things he liked. When I go to the stores and look at TVs in the optimal settings, I still think my Vizio looks better than most at any price.", "Date": "December 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing picture out of the box", "Author": "Aprelak", "ReviewID": "R1BJPD0499JPYC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "VIZIO  XVT553SV 55-Inch 240 Hz TruLED LCD HDTV with VIZIO Internet Application, BlackThis led is truly amazing directly out of the box.

I know that electronics can be faulty. I know that with every major electronics buy that you have roughly a 3% chance of the product being faulty in one way or another. So I will tell you my story. 6 Days ago I went to my Local Sams and purchased the Vizio XVT553SV. I've been wanting a new tv and did some internet reviews for weeks and finally decided to go with the Vizio. The reason I bought the tv is because every time I looked at what I wanted on reviews I always came back to this tv, and with the great reviews from Amazon & CNet I decided that I would roll the dice.So I buy the tv bring it home take it to my man cave(finished basement)Plug it in and go through all the steps and hook it up to my PS3 via HDMI hookups.TV looks pretty amazing. I watched SPEED RACER on bluray and wow I was stunned at the clarity. Went to bed.Next morning went downstairs to see my new baby (the tv) turned it on and fired up the PS3.WOE! Scrambling all over the place of picture..lights flashing all kinds of crazy stuff going on with the screen. I checked all the HDMI inputs wondering if I just had one that went bad overnight or something and that wasn't the problem..though hmmm wonder if my HDMI cable went bad so took the PS3 and hooked it up to my 40\" SAMMY LCD 650 series and it worked flawlessly...hmm not the HDMI cable.Went back downstairs plugged PS3 back in to tv..same thing..distortion everywhere. I'm not talking light fuzz..I'm talking scrambled picture like when you're a teenager trying to tune in a cable channel that you don't get so you can see a glimpse of skin bad....actually worst.Weird thing is...3-5 minutes later the picture would slowly unscramble and tune in and picture looked perfect...so I thought ..hmmm what the crap?My nerves calmed and I decided to throw in Inception (bluray)....OMG what happened? I didn't the major blooming on Speed RACER because that movie is such a bright movie. But watching Inception It is the worst case of blooming I've ever seen. I said that was it..I went to turn the TV off and BAM I can't. TV just froze on me solid. I actually had to hold the power button down on the side for 30 seconds to get the tv to turn off. So I thought to myself...wow, I must have just got a lemon. I called the Sams I bought it from, told them what was happening and they said that I could return it and get another one but they were out of stock so the next closest Sams that had it in stock was 74 miles away.FINE.Took the TV back exchanged it for another brand new one.got it home took it out of the box and OMG scrambled to hell again..then tv eventually warmed up and picture came in...but the new tv still had MAJOR Blooming...I'm not talking light blooming either I'm talking halo angel like effect in dark scenes.Needless to say I took the tv back.Now here is the deal. I've had two brand new TVs from two totally different sams club areas. Both were majorly messed up. I think that is pretty high odds. I don't know if they changed the electronics in these things or Vizio is playing panel lottery butI wasn't a happy customer.I did go to AVS forums and in the last 30 or so pages is starting to become a major recurring problem with these TV's. I think it's only a matter of time before CNET starts getting emailed telling them that this in no way can be a Editors Choice for 2010.I will tell you this..some have taken pictures and put them on the site and are not having the blooming problems nor the startup problems that others are having. And believe me I'm pretty technical. I've tried everything...changing HDMI cables from 1.3 to 1.4, trying other electronics instead of the PS3 for startup. Tweaked calibrations...even freaking doing crazy things like messaging the screen like some have did for other TVs to help with blooming. What it boils down to is nothing worked...Now that you have read my entire review I would like to summarize my why I wouldn't buy this tv again:Because it is piece of faulty JUNK.", "Date": "January 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "VIZIO XVT553SV 55-Inch 240 Hz TruLED LCD HDTV with VIZIO Internet Application, Black", "Author": "Edward E.

From what I could tell in a brief time of it working, it had a great picture (though not as bright as a previous Samsung, which suffered from horrible reflections of lights in the room).  The Vizio internet apps were nice and easy to use.  After a few hours of non-use, I turned on the TV to a great picture, that lasted for about an hour, then the flicker and back to the black screen.  When I turn it on, the white Vizio lights up and the sound is there, but no picture.  Never even see the VIA logo at the beginning.  I liked it and had planned to get a replacement, however, after seeing all the comments on the web indicating this is a fairly common problem, I am planning to return and try another brand.

I searched some other web sites and found other reviews going back as far as March 2011, saying that customers were told the same thing.  So the update is likely never coming.So go ahead and buy this TV if you're cool with completely unexpected shutdowns every week or so.

It says that you should be able to use PIP/POP with any combination of inputs, but you can only do it with HDMI/any other input.  So if you had a composite and component, you could not use PIP/POP, but if you had HDMI and composite/component, you can use it.  This is not a major issue since the game system I'm using will eventually be upgraded to an HDMI cable and the Roku does have an HDMI, but this might be something for people to consider.It was shipped already assembled to its base, which was very convenient for me since I had to unpack it by myself.  The LG TV we bought at the end of 2010 required base assembly, which is difficult to do by yourself with such a heavy TV.The widgets that this TV has are very nice.  It has a wide variety of things such as Twitter, Netflix, Pandora, TV Guide, Vudu, Rhapsody, and even a map widget which uses Yahoo! Maps.  In addition to these, it has a few weather widgets and TV channel widgets.Another very nice feature of this TV is the remote, which has a slide-out qwerty keyboard.  The buttons are a little small, but when using Netflix or anything else where you have to type in a search box, it is extremely helpful.All in all, I would highly recommend this TV to anybody, but I would point out that it only has one component and one composite connection, so if you have a lot of older components you might have to consider getting some sort of switch to connect all of them to this TV.

The keyboard on the Vizio remote is sized for elves, not people, but it does make it possible to type in names for HDMI inputs, router addresses, and the like. That's handy.My Samsung has an aspect ratio control that lets me set screen format for 4:3. I use this to play travel video DVDs.

The next day (4 days of turning off every 5 and a half minutes) the next tech support agent said (1) it's a known issue with this model; (2) it is not reparable with a service call; (3) they are \"working on\" a firmware update that will be sent out to all these TVs \"in the near future\"; and (4) they don't know what \"near future\" means.  So if you have a very short attention span (say, 5 and a half minutes or less) or don't mind buying today a TV that will work \"in the near future\", go ahead and get this one.

Driver was by himself so I helped bring it in. Set up and hooked to internet with no problems. Pictue has to be seen to be appreciated. I then ordered the Cheatah wall mount. Cheap price but well built and very easy to wall mount and hook up. No problems with cables since had 10' HDMI cables for Direct TV and my DVR and also 10 ft for my old VHS.  Hooked it to my surround system with optical cable  and worked very well. These were all the Amazon branded cables and were cheap but the electrons did no know difference and worked very well.

This is my third Vizio (I also have a 37\") and it appears to be of the same high quality as my previous sets.Pros:- Great picture. Deep blacks, bright colors, no tearing or other artifacts with high-speed action sequences. 1080p looks killer, but everything down to 480p looks better than it did on my older set (which wasn't bad).- Full LED variable backlight. Completely gets rid of grey blacks in dark scenes - black are blacks, whites are bright, even when next to each other in a frame.- Internet Apps. I wasn't sure how much I'd use these - I already had Netflix, so I figured I'd use that a little, but that was about it. However, I find myself using them quite a bit. As an Amazon prime customer, I also get some of Amazons streaming and this set supports that too, but it also has apps for a number of other interesting feeds, including Revision3 and TWiT, both of which I enjoy. I find myself going to the internet apps more and more. Also, I've noticed that Netflix via the app on the TV looks significantly better than the computer-based viewer from my HTPC - I suspect the TV app supports Netflix HD format much better than the Silverlight-based PC solution.- Bluetooth remote. I really like it that I never have to aim the remote at the TV. Great when I'm at the dining room table and the couch blocks IR beams. Also, the remote, with the full QWERTY foldout keyboard is pretty nifty and pretty well laid out.- Audio pass-through on *all* HDMI inputs. The TV will pass audio from any HDMI input out via optical to my amp. No longer do I have to change amp inputs to sync it with the video being displayed. This one was a huge deal for me, since my amp is pre-HDMI and can't act as my switch. This ultimately caused issues with my HTPC, which I resolved. See my reviews on the Cables Unlimited DVI and Digital Audio to HDMI and Evga GeForce GT 430 Graphics Card for that little adventure.- Easy to use setup. The first time you turn on the TV, it steps you through setup that's pretty painless. It takes about 15-20 minutes, but when you're done, most folks will never have touch the settings again.- Light. The whole thing only weighs about 80 pounds. If it weren't for the fact that it's so large, it would easily be a one person job to move it around and set it up.- Matte finish screen. So many manufactures are going over to glossy screens, which look snazzy in the store, but as soon as you get them home and turn on a lamp behind you or next to you, you realize you just lost part of your picture to glare. Vizio understand this and uses a matte screen so even if you get a little glare, it's diffuse enough that it doesn't ruin the view completely as the glossy screens do.- Network setup. I use a wired setup, so I can't talk about the wireless, but the wired was dead simple. I just plugged in a cat5e cable to the back of the TV, the other end to the switch behind the TV and the TV got out the internet first try - no configuration needed.Cons:- It's big when setting up. You're going to want 2 people to set it in place. It's not very heavy, but it is cumbersome to try and deal with by yourself.- Bluetooth remote. This is one of those good-news/bad news features. While I love that I don't have to point the remote at the TV to make things happen, the fact that Vizio chose bluetooth means that you can only control it via IR with third party remotes like a Logitech Harmony. Why didn't Vizio go with a standard RF frequency? Then I could have used the high-end Harmony remotes and gotten down to 1 remote. As it is, I'm stuck with 2 - one for the TV and 1 for all the other devices (which all use RF). I could go all IR, but that kinda defeats the purpose...- Boot up. When I was a kid back in the 60's, you turned on the TV and then waited for it to warm up before you saw anything. Then, somewhere in the 70's TVs became \"instant on\". Well, welcome back to the good old days. New TVs aren't TVs, they're computers and as such, they have to boot. So, when you turn it on, you're looking at a nice \"V\" logo for about 15 seconds while the system boots up, loads the apps, etc. Yeah, it's only 15 seconds, but it's still strange to be back to this point again.- Old firmware. My set shipped with what must have been old firmware. The day after I set it up, I got a message when I turned it on that it was loading up new firmware. I think it's cool that the TV can be updated as new stuff becomes available, but I would have preferred if, as part of the initial setup, it would have done this. I spent 30 minutes the first day trying to figure out how to get the free streaming video from Amazon (as a prime member), only to discover the next day that it needed new firmware to manage it. Also, there was no notification as to what was new - I stumbled over a new feature called \"CEC\" that isn't even in the manual I downloaded from Vizio. Turns out I can't use it, but still, would have saved me 15 minutes on Google finding out what it was.Overall, I'm thrilled with TV. Vizio continues to make a high-quality product at a very aggressive price. I was at a \"big box\" store the other day and told one of the blue shirts what I paid for the TV and what it's features were and he muttered that even with his employee discount he couldn't get a 55\" set with the features of this one for close to that price.Great picture, great price, great features.", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazon.com is worth it.", "Author": "Aj", "ReviewID": "R3JMKKGTZPUAJG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product is great.

I got it at a price about $500 below most tvs in this category ($1447) and it has every feature I would want besides 3D, which I'm not sold on yet. Picture was great right out of the box and looked slightly better when I put in setting found in a C-NET review. I love the dull mat finish of the screen because it doesn't show reflections. The picture is still bright and clear so a shiny glass screen isn't needed. Some people complain about the sound but I think it is good enough that I rarely turn on my surround sound system anymore. The built in internet aps are great for doing a quick check of the weather in all your favorite cities with just a few button pushes on the remote. It does this split screen so you don't have to miss anything in the show your watching. There are codes for the remote to allow it to work great with my TIVO HD so I don't have to juggle several at one time. I also like the you-tube ap for sharing a favorite funny video. I turned off the motion flow feature like most people do because it seems to cause jittering instead of eliminating it and the picture movement is smooth and great without it. I haven't seen any of the flaring of bright white areas against black that some people mention so maybe they just had the contrast turned up to the max and the off angle viewing is very good.

They had me perform some tests -- and then concluded it was broken. They asked me to scan my receipt and send it to them -- so they could arrange a repair. I did that -- and then they said, sorry -- but there is nothing we can do for you -- your warranty was only 1 year. I said that it seemed unreasonable that my $1,800 tv was viewed as disposible -- and that this was not a user problem (no abuse, no dropping it, spilling on it, etc.). They said that I should understand that this is a sophisticated piece of electronics -- and I needed to buy an extended warranty. Personally, I said that my expectation is that an $1,800 tv will work for more than 15 months.

We bought it for the picture and let me tell you, it doesn't disappoint!As for details, starting with the setup of this set -- it couldn't be easier.  One minor problem I experienced was with the initial step-by-step setup.  It happened so fast I missed it.  Be prepared, as soon as you plug this bad boy in things will start happening.  But even having missed this supposed easier install, I was able to attach a satelite dish, a DVD player, and a VCR with few issues.  The connections are clearly marked and easy to use, and after just a couple of minutes I had the satelite dish connected via HDMI and was recieving a great picture.  I couldn't get it to fill the screen initially, but after a few minutes with the clearly-written manual, I was able to determine that the fault was with the setup of the dish, not the TV. (For people migrating from standard-def TV to HDTV, be prepared to reset your aspect ratio.)  A few clicks of my dish remote and I had an amazing 55\" picture in front of me.  At this point I took a 15 minute break while I went from HD channel to HD channel just gazing at the beautiful picture.I attached the DVD player next, and even though it's an older unit and I connected it up via the composite (yellow/red/white) connection, playing a movie was a wonderful experience.  I was ablt to easily set the TV into wide-screen mode so the picture was as wide as the set, and it was just like being in a theatre!  I again took another break to partially watch several disks and gawk at the great picture.The hardest unit to set up was the VCR, because I had to revert to using the RF (coax or antennae) connection.  Be prepared, as there are only 2 of the older connection types available -- 1 composite and 1 RF.  Not that you'll want to use these older ones long anyway, as the picture quality is not nearly as good with them, so know up front that HDMI is the way to go with this set.  Easy to set up and there are 5 of them!  Anyway, once I did the RF setup on the TV (you know, letting it \"look\" for channels), I could put it on channel 3 and view a movie from the VCR.  Again, not the greatest picture, but when you consider you're using 1980's technology, not bad.I couldn't set up our WII video game at this point because I didn't have a component (Red/Green/Blue + Red/White) cable -- the WII only comes with a composite cabe, but we're already looking for a new one -- but I am confident that it will look just as amazing.Overall, I'd give this set an 11 out of 10 just on the viewing experience alone.  Be prepared for the limited number of older style connections -- or just go all HDMI -- but setting the unit up and adding additional components is extremely easy, and I just can't say enough about the picture itself.  Tape your socks on, otherwise they will be knocked right off!The only real problem I had was with delivery.  The box the TV comes in is huge, so a company like UPS won't deliver it.  We don't live in a big city, so not only did the delivery company not help me with the setup, but I had issues with the local delivery guys not calling the correct number and not being able to find us on a map, and I think that cost us a day.  Considering that the delivery was free though, I guess I can't really complain too much.If you've been waiting for flat-screens TV's to come down in price or have certain features, the time is right.  I would highly recommend this Vizio not only for it's eye-popping picture and ear-pleasing sound, but for it's ease of set up and it's appearence as well.  It truly looks good off as well as on, and the only way it could get better is if they lower the price even more!", "Date": "November 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very pleased", "Author": "Dave S.", "ReviewID": "R2GQ5WPGD01QNA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just to put this review in perspective, this is my first HDTV.  I've had it for around one month now.  I was about to purchase the older 552XVT model but just happened to notice the 553SV.  From a specs standpoint, the 553SV is improved over the 552XVT.  It has a higher contrast ratio and more zones in its full array LED package (I had a strong preference for a full array vs. edge lit LED).  The 553SV also looks sharper and is a couple of inches thinner than the 552XVT.  I purchased the 553SV from Amazon.  Delivery was on time and the delivery guy brought in the TV, unpacked it, and made sure it was working.  That was nice.  Setup and connections were no problem.  The remote is somewhat chunky but it's solid and easy to use.  The slide out keyboard is a nice feature (this feature is on earlier models as well).  Connecting the TV to our wireless network was easy and was accomplished in seconds.  We get a strong connection.  We've successfully streamed a movie from Amazon VOD without any pausing or buffering.  I am very, very impressed with the picture quality of the Vizio.  I use the calibration settings from CNET but I left the ambient light sensor on because our room's light level is constantly changing during the day.  If you're picky, it's easy to change the picture settings through the TV's on-screen menu.  Our TV signal is through FIOS (connected through HDMI) and the HD channels are nothing short of outstanding in terms of PQ.  HD movies and sports are great to watch.  The audio is also surprisingly good.  I'm not a video gamer so I can't comment on that.  I also don't have a blu-ray player yet.  Watching SD channels is ok but obviously not as nice as the HD stuff.  I don't even bother watching SD anymore unless it's programming for our kids.Not much negative to report yet.  If you have older peripherals, you may miss the S-Video port.  That's what I was using to connect my DVD player to my previous CRT.  Now I connect using component cables.  I would also like to see the Blockbuster widget.  According to press releases earlier in the year, Vizio reached an agreement to put the Blockbuster widget on their internet TVs so hopefully it will get added soon.All in all, this is a great TV.  The picture quality is really impressive.  I'm not a true videophile, but if you check other reviews from the more professional sites, you'll also find very positive comments.  I highly recommend the 553SV.", "Date": "September 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Main Board quit after 16 months", "Author": "Amotd", "ReviewID": "R1JGRP9QN4J3QS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The screen went black after 16 months but still had sound.

His toon quickly changed when his only suggestion was to to do a reset and the problem did not go away.  At that point he very quickly pointed out it only came with a 12 month warranty and gave me the number of a repair service company.  While he was correct that I was four months out of warranty he offered nothing but an \"oh well\" when I said I expected their wonderful tv that he had been praising a few minutes earlier to last a bit longer.  Luckily before I threw the thing out the door I realized I had bought on my American Express and had an extra year of warranty coverage.  Main board was bad and is being replaced and fully covered by the warranty extension.This was my first and last purchase of a Vizio product.  For $1,500+ I expect a product to still be working after 16 months.  An offer to split the cost of repair would have been a nice customer service gesture when I asked if there was anything he could do and would have shown that Vizio stood behind their products.

When you finally get a working one, it's the best I've ever seen.I ordered this TV a little over a month ago.  It was delivered a week later, I set it up and watched Avatar on Blu-Ray.  The picture was absolutely magnificent.  Later that night, my wife was watching a DVD and the screen went blank.  Much fiddling and still a blank screen.  No menus, no nothing.  A call to Vizio support the next morning determined it needed to be replaced.  They said they could do it or I could have it replaced through Amazon, so I sent it back to Amazon and had them send me another one.Second one arrived a week later.  Hooked it up and went through the set-up then left for work without really watching anything on it.  That night, while watching a DVD, the wife and I noticed dark splotches in several areas of the screen.  Switching to different inputs/sources, movies, etc didn't change anything.  These areas always appeared darker than the rest of the screen.  (I think the local dimming controller had issues).  Called Vizio support again and once more determined that the set needed to be replaced.  I opted to do it through Vizio this time as they said their delivery agency would bring it in, hook it up and make sure all was well before leaving.One week later (yesterday) the third TV arrived.  The delivery guy brought it in, set it up, turned it on, and all was well with the world.  It's been 24+ hours now and still no issues.I would recommend the TV to anyone, with the caveat that they should find a dealer locally to buy it from.  A place where they can go have the dealer plug in the specific TV they are going to buy so they can check it out before they take it home.I finally settled on three stars due to the apparent quality control issue Vizio has and the hassles I went through to get a functional set.

I had gotten a message on Thursday from the delivery service saying they would not be able to get the TV to me until Monday.  I called them back that afternoon, and explained the dire situation of Playoff weekend without the new Vizio.  The guy understood completely, and got the TV to me on Friday.It took longer than expected to get everything up and running since we were connecting the new TV, a new PS3 Move and the Pioneer receiver for the home theater.  Better instructions for getting everything to work together would help, plus we will need to go through setup again when the Harmony One remote arrives to try and make operation of all the components easier for my wife (and me).Now the really good...this is without the best picture I have ever seen, and everyone looking at it with me agrees.  My brother-in-law who helped me set up the system is still in awe of the picture quality, and the ability to be connected with WiFi.  He owns three HDTV's, and will probably get in trouble with his wife when he just has to order this TV, too.  The two games we watched were just like being there!One other thing...after getting everything set up, the TV had a very annoying white line running across the top of the picture.  My first thought was there was a flaw in the set, and someone was going to have to come out to fix it.  I called Vizio, and they were very helpful in getting the problem fixed on the spot...the picture just needed to be adjusted vertically slightly.Overall I can't be more happy with the Vizio.

Audio is great as well, but I use my surround speakers for any movie watching.. so dont really need TV output audio as much.Cons: The thickness and weight of this unit.. I would have liked a thin form factor like a sammy, but I think the downside to that would be that edge lit picture quality doesnt come anywhere close to this unit.- Component connectors.. given the thickness of the TV, I would have liked the connectors to be a little more recessed into the TV so that I could mount it closer to the wall with a thin profile mount. There's a little bit of a recess, but not enough.- Power cable - I dont know why companies dont all just make power cables with low profile plugs like some refrigerator companies do. The power cable has a HUGE plug that plugs into your power socket and again makes it hard to mount on the wall without a significant gap behind the TV. I replaced this cable with a different one to get closer to the wall. I had rewired my power socket such that it was concealed behind the TV.

I am not a \"techno-geek\", so I'll try to stick to issues the average viewer will care about.The picture quality is first rate.  Watching football on this giant, clear screen is just unbelievable. No wonder Vizio is the official HDTV of the NFL!  Just be sure to use the \"Football\" picture settings.I thought the picture looked great right out of the box.  However, I do think you should tweak it a bit to suit your individual taste.  I tried the suggested \"Movie\" settings that others have posted in their reviews, and I do find them even more pleasing to my eye.  Whether you like the picture brighter, or your colors extra vibrant...or more natural...you will be able to adjust this set perfectly.Setup and connection to my home Network (does work with WEP) was a snap and took just a few minutes.  The Vizio Apps feature was a big reason I bought this tv....I wanted to be able to access my Netflix account.  It works great...even though the speed of my DSL line leaves a bit to be desired. The Netflix movies play perfectly..although my connection is not fast enough to play HDX quality on VUDU without a lot of buffering.  In any event, the movies look fine.  In fact, I think this tv does a great job with non-HD programming...much better than my older JVC HD-ILA projection set.  I use DirecTV, by the way, and it looks really good.  It is true that you can't surf the web on this model...but Vizio never advertised that you could...so I don't understand that complaint.Linking the clever remote control to my DirecTV HD-DVR and my Sony Blu-Ray was also a snap...and it controls all of my devices completely and easily.  I don't fully understand how it does that via Bluetooth, since those sources are not so-equipped, but it all works fine and that's all that matters.  As several other reviewers have stated, it would be nice if the remote was backlit, but I think the slide-out keyboard and not having to aim it at the tv or other inputs more than makes up for that minor shortcoming.Other quick points...glare is minimal due to the matte screen.  You can't turn off the VIZIO logo under the screen...but I really don't find it distracting as some others have said.  Delivery via Pilot was right on time as I had scheduled on the Amazon order screen.  It was cold outside when delivered, so I just had them unbox it to check for damage and let it warm up before I plugged it in...as they recommend.I have had none of the problems mentioned by others...no pink screen...no freezing...no popping noises...maybe I am just lucky, I don't know....so I have not had to contact Vizio...therefore I can't comment on their customer support yet.

This model offers plenty of inputs for all your entertainment needs (4 HDMI, I even charge my Iphone to one of the 3 HDMI ports). And the picture quality is the best I\u2019ve seen on any HDTV, watching sports is even better then being there. I still get compliments from friends asking, how is your picture quality that amazing, my HDTV doesn\u2019t look that good? Now the internet apps, I use Netflix, VUDU, Amazon Instant Video and Yahoo Fantasy Football the most. All the other apps are pretty disappointing and I would like to see more development in this area. I connect my MAC through HDMI to truly offer the internet connected TV experience that I was looking for (mainly surfing the web or playing Itunes). The only major disappointment I have for this TV was the remote. It does have a slide out keyboard which is handy with the apps, however it is bulky. Additionally it is not backlit which makes it impossible to use in the dark while watching a movie.Finally Vizio\u2019s Customer Service is hands down the best! They are friendly and respectful while concentrating on answering questions or problems. I experienced a hardware issue that caused horizontal black lines on my screen. Customer Service first attempted troubleshooting with me over the phone. After recognizing that did not fix the problem, Vizio sent out and setup up a new TV.

In the evening and at night, using the settings I found on-line, it looks so \"real\" it is way more enjoyable than the old TV (which was almost un-watchable in the daytime.)While yes, my room is very small, I have no complaints at all about the sound from this set. It is clear, dynamic and very immersive. More than enough to overcome the noise from my oxygen making machine and other house noises. I only wish I could plug a set of headphones into it for late night viewing.Another resident here has a 47inch TV that cost about the same as I paid for this and there is no comparison. For about the same money, my TV is not only larger, but the picture quality, smoothness and detail make the other set look pale, washed out and lacking in detail.Even though buying this TV was a real financial stretch for me, It's one of the few things I ever bought that I have absolutely no regrets about buying (my iMac is the only other nice thing I own)For someone like me who is confined to bed about 95% of the time, and who watches a LOT of movies, I am 110% satisfied and love it so much I couldn't care less how much it cost.", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "R.

I am not a technically inclined so I won't give you any specification details, but the color on the TV is vivid and outstanding, with guests saying the same thing. Sound is above average. App functions are easy to navigate and the remote with the keyboard is simple to use. Previous reviews I read stated that the TV will freeze up, which requires a start up/reboot.

The picture for football and hockey is beyond belief. I've become hooked on NatGeo, love Alaska State Troopers, because the scenery is so vivid. The HD picture is better than a buddy of mine who bought the Samsung 6400. Perhaps it's because it's full LED and not just edge-lit. A couple of downsides: It's not as thin as some of the other LED tv's and when watching a non-HD station, such as King of Queens on TVLand, there are some lights along the top of the picture that flash like a string of lights. Not a biggie to me, but it might bother others. For what I paid and how I use the tv, sports, movies, and primarily HD programming, the picture is out-of-this-world. If anyone knows how to get rid of the lights at the top of some non-HD programming, it's only a couple of stations that do it, let me know. Also, we've had the tv a month and I just used the out of box settings. Before I bought the tv I read recommended settings; just can't see how it could get any better.

Great picture quality and the sound is OK, but then I am spoiled with a 7.1 surround sound system. This replaces a 47 in Vizio, which still works great--just moved it to another room.  I had a difficult time linking my new 55 in TV to my Vizio router, but a great tech service rep at Vizio walked me through a long procedure to fix the problem. The Vizio aps would not recognize my router(and it is a Vizio router); if this happens to you, give Vizio a call and they will walk you through it---very complicated, but it worked.UPDATE: 10-31-11The next problem I had was that I could not listen to the sound through my Onkyo surround sound system, only through the TV speakers.  Another call to Vizio told me what to do: you have to use a HDMI 1.4 cable, and mine was a 1.3.  She also said that the receiver had to be ARC capable, whatever that means.  I called Onkyo today, and the rep said that my receiver was ARC, and there were some settings that had to be changed--which he walked me through.  He also said that I had to hook up the HDMI 1.4 cable to a special HDMI outlet on the Vizio tv that said \"ARC\".  Actually there is no \"ARC\" on the Vizio; the regular input HDMI is ARC, but it is not marked as such.I do not know why Amazon raised the price of this TV from $1400 last week to $1674 this week, especially since Sams sells it for $1400.  I think Amazon will be competitive but do not know that for sure.  Anyway, do not pay $300 more just to get it here.I got my 1.4 HDMI cable and hooked it up, and I am now able to listen to the TV thru my Onkyo surround system, and my TV speakers, or either separately.  The trick is to turn OFF the CEC functions on your Vizio: go to \"TV settings\" via the Vizio apps, then scroll down to \"CEC settings\", and make sure the CEC function and system audio control are turned off. If you do not do this, then you will not be able to listen to your surround sound speakers.  Personally I prefer to listen to 9 speakers, rather than 7.The next problem that I discovered is that you CANNOT listen to your surround sound system if you access Netflix, or Pandora, or other internet apps through your Vizio TV.  You can only listen to these apps through your TV speakers.  I first thought this was an Onkyo problem, but found out it is a Vizio problem.  For some reason, the Vizio apps software will not work with a surround system; I confirmed this yesterday with a Vizio tech rep.  So if you are planning to listen to Netflix or any other Vizio apps through your surround sound system, you are out of luck.  I do not know if this is so if you have a Vizio sound bar, but it sure is with an Onkyo system. (SEE LATEST UPDATE BELOW ON HOW TO GET AROUND THIS PROBLEM)The way I got around this problem is to spend another $100 and buy a Roku player, and access Netflix, Pandora, and hundreds of other apps through the Roku box rather than through the Vizio apps on your TV.  Actually, the Roku gives you almost 300 apps, whereas the Vizio only gives you about a dozen.  Had I known all this in advance, I probably would have gotten another TV, because I paid for stuff that I will never use.  Another option is to get a Bluray player that has internet apps and hook it up to your surround sound system, but the Roku will cost you about $100 on Amazon, and Bluray players are more expensive.The Vizio rep I talked with said I should contact Vizio and complain about this problem, and I intend to do that today.UPDATE NOV 1, 2011: My Onkyo is a TX-SR 608.  I do use an optical cable to route to my receiver, and the ARC on the Onkyo is turned on.  When I turn on the CEC setting on the TV, and the SAC, and when I turn the Onkyo on,  then I can listen to the Onkyo speakers only; the TV speakers do not work. If I turn the Onkyo off, then I can listen to the TV speakers.  With the Onkyo on, I can control the volume of the Onkyo speakers with either the TV remote or the Onkyo remote, but I cannot mute the sound using the Onkyo remote; I have to use the TV remote to mute the sound. This works watching the TV and also using the VIA to watch Netflix.With the CEC and SAC settings on the TV turned to \"off\", and the Onkyo receiver on, then I can listen to TV using the both the sound with the TV speakers and the Onkyo speakers, and I can control either separately using the Onkyo remote and the TV remote. Using this setup, the mute on the Onkyo receiver works.  However, using this same setup, if I turn on Netflix using the VIA apps on the Vizio TV, then I can listen to the sound only through the TV speakers.  So the bottom line is that if you want to listen to Netflix using the VIA apps, and hear the sound through the surround sound speakers, then both the CEC and SAC settings should be turned \"on\".  If this sounds confusing, it is, but that is the only way I have found that it works.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent performance in daylight lit room!", "Author": "Honest Abe", "ReviewID": "RXY6ZVROY95JB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had Vizio XVT553SV for about month now.

(A restaurant/bar I visit had a dead Vizio panel hanging on the wall for quite a while. Not a good advertisement, huh.) Rather than purchasing from Walmart (and having to figure out a way to haul it home) I ordered it--along with a Sanus Full Motion Wall Mount--from Amazon. It took two weeks to receive, but the delivery company was very good about keeping in touch during the process. Mounting this beast to the wall is not easy so make sure you have help! The onscreen setup worked flawlessly, integrating perfectly into my wifi, 5.1 Sony home theater setup, and bluRay player. I did have an unexpected problem arise: some of the channels we tuned to through the cable box had very pronounced lip sync issues. Almost unwatchable and very annoying. Two long calls to Vizio support gave me answers I didn't want to hear. The suggested solution: running separate audio cables and an HDMI cable from the back of the TV (from the audio out) down the wall to the amplifier audio in. This really ticked me off, since I had installed an HDMI outlet in the wall that worked fine with our other flat panel. The technician said, no, that the recommended way to do it was this rinky-dink setup. He said it was the cable (Verizon FIOS) company's box that was causing the audio sync issue. He also suggested I get an optical cable for optimum sound. After spending $18 on the optical cable and messing up my clean setup everything works fine. No lip sync issue. Yesterday I was looking at the Sony amp instruction manual and found an AV Sync setup paragraph buried on page 44. I changed the setting; hooked my HDMI cables back up the way I had them with the old set; and now everything works fine! Okay, how do I like the set. The picture is fantastic. The VIA (internet widgets) seem like a lot of fun, but I haven't used them much (I've had the TV a week). The lit VIZIO logo below the screen doesn't seem to bother me. I can't speak about reliability yet. My old Westinghouse 32-inch is still humming along after 4 years, so I hope I get this kind of life out of this unit. I seriously thought--and almost purchased--a SONY for $1,000 more.UPDATE: It's been five months since I purchased this television and everything is still a-okay.

I recommend getting a good home-theater-in-a-box anyway (I got the Samsung HT-C6500 from walmart.com), but at least the Vizio is usable without one.No dead pixels as far as I can tell.Cons:It's a solid TV, so I have no real complaints.  I will say I don't have much use for the apps.  Updating facebook on the TV doesn't really appeal to me.---------------------------------Update:I've now had this TV for a few months and do have one complaint.  The TV will sometimes turn itself off.  I've seen other complaints online about this and spent some time with Vizio technical support to try to figure it out.  In general, the tech support people are friendly and knowledgeable.  But I do have some advice for you if you contact them.  For any problem that's not obviously bad hardware (such as dead pixels), you'll want to do the following:1) Make sure the TV can get to the internet so it can update its firmwareIf that doesn't resolve things, then2) turn the TV off, unplug it for 30 seconds or so, plug it back in, and turn it back onAnd if that doesn't resolve the problem, then3) press the power button (on the lower left hand side of the TV) and hold it for 30 seconds.  This does a more comprehensive reset of the TV (and probably loses any sound/picture settings you've changed).These are all things the tech support people will ask you to do anyway, so you may as well try it before you call in.I had thought I only saw this behavior as I was using the remote control for another device.  The Vizio tech support person said that sometimes a remote's hex codes can confuse the TV if they're similar enough to its own codes.  But I am now sure that it happens spontaneously, with nobody touching any remote controls.  For that reason, I've lowered my review from 5 to 4 stars.", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love it!!!", "Author": "Norman Nelson", "ReviewID": "R1SRMLUMVLJ9LN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We were pleased with the price and the delivery.

I could not be happier.  The picture is amazing, very close to my plasma in the basement. I have the tv opposite a sliding glass door so I could not get a plasma or any other tv with a glossy screen.  The matte screen almost completely eliminates glare.The VIA apps did not work for a few days while I was waiting for the firmware upgrade to be installed.  Would be nice if there was a way to manually perform a firmware upgrade.  DLNA compatibility to view my videos over the network from my computer would be a nice addition, but not a show stopper.The only other thing is that you have to adjust the picture settings for Amazon, Vudu, Netflix and each input separately without a way to quickly copy them from one to another.  The default settings for Netflix and Amazon make the movie look like it was shot with a camcorder.  Once they are tuned, the picture looks amazing.****UPDATE 4/12/2013****There is a known issue that is discussed all over the web with the TV rebooting or freezing suddenly.  It used to happen once a month or so.  Now it happens almost daily.  The only fix is to unplug it and allow it to restart.  It has become super annoying.

I am now on my second TV and it didn't even last 10 minutes.From day one on the original TV the picture would freeze up within a few seconds after turning on the TV.  During that time you could not do anything with the TV.  After 1 1/2 minutes the TV would shut itself off for about 1 1/2 minutes then turn itself back on and things would be fine until the next time you turn the TV on and the whole freeze up thing would happen again.  After many calls to Vizio (at least 1 hour each call) Vizio finally acknowledged they couldn't figure out why this was happening and they would send someone out to repair it.So we just lived with it this way until the repair person could come.  They came out 3 weeks ago and put in a new motherboard.  I set the TV and the DVD recorder and VCR up (for like the 10th time now) and was happy to have a working TV.  But 4 hours later when I went to shut the TV off, it would not shut off and stay off.  Within seconds of turning it off it would turn itself back on.  More hours on the phone with Vizio.So Vizio agreed this one must be lemon and they would replace it BUT IT TAKES 3 WEEKS FOR THE REPLACEMENT TO BE DELIVERED!So for 3 weeks we unplugged our TV every time just to shut it off.The new replacement came today and within seconds of getting things hooked up and trying to set it up the video picture would blink on and off.  By the time it made it through setup and I actually got a TV show on the screen, the picture went black for the last time and never came back on.Another hour or longer on the phone with Vizio and they can't figure out what to do so they will send a repair person out...NEXT FRIDAY...

Since we have a DVR we just back up and watch what we missed, so for us it is no big deal. We believe we have traced this ongoing issue to a power fluctuation. It seems to happen a few days after we have a house-wide power dip and those happen about 4 or 5 times a year around here.We haven't and won't use all of the bells and whistles and applications of the set, but having immediate access to Netflix and Amazon Prime video on demand is awesome. Of course, during high usage times of day we sometimes experience video delays but I can't put that to the set, it is a network issue. Speaking of which, prepare to spend 15-20 minutes doing the initial setup and registration with your network. This is not a ply out of the box set. But, once done, it is done!As for the picture, even in 480i mode, the colors are brilliant and the picture is sharp. 720p is phenomenal. You can spot individual blades of grass on a football field. You can see the hairs on Kathy Lee Gifford's chin on the Today show. You can see how badly news anchors put on makeup by troweling or spray-[painting it on themselves.But, most of all, even in daytime and in a moderately bright room, you see an amazing picture. And, from a very wide angle without distortion.Bottom line is that we bought the extended three-year warranty just in case and I would definitely suggest you do the same. This is really a complicated computer with a flat screen monitor, and with only four replacement parts, all expensive out of warranty, you don't want to be left holding the bag if there is a problem after the 1-year warranty!", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Picture", "Author": "Yumalee", "ReviewID": "R3MC4F05JXN55T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like the picture and all other features.

Skeen", "ReviewID": "R3HLD0V4PGAAM3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was mostly pleased with this TV until this January when the new firmware update went out. The way these TVs work is Vizio periodically sends out firmware updates, and the TV automatically installs them when this happens. There is no way to manually change the firmware back to a previous version should something happen to go wrong. Since the latest update, my TV has been occasionally displaying a jittery frame rate during filmed material. It looks sort of like the slow-motion effect that is intentionally used sometimes, but this is being done by the TV's video processing. It happens on all inputs and on over the air stations. If you pause a disc when it is doing this and then start it again, the problem usually goes away, which proves that this is not related to the material itself. Another problem that came up was that when playing PAL material (I have an all-region DVD player and a multi-standard VHS machine) the TV now automatically applies the \"smooth-motion feature\", which essentially makes filmed material look like video. (One reason I chose a Vizio was its ability to display PAL, as not all US TVs can.) Although one Vizio representative has said this would not be caused by a firmware update, I remain suspicious since these problems were NOT there before the update.Vizio's tech support was extremely unhelpful with this. Most of their people are courteous, but they simply don't have enough knowledge about their products or how they work. One even suggested that this was being caused by my having so many components hooked up to it! Luckily I bought the extended warranty, but the service people they sent over weren't very bright. I had the main control board replaced TWICE, neither time did it fix the frame rate problem. The first guy insisted that it wasn't a problem with the TV (then why did he bother to replace the board in the first place?) and the second just said \"Uh, I don't know if that can be fixed\", said his company would call me back later with what to do next, then never called back. After this there were several days of \"negotiating\" between Vizio and the warranty company before they agreed to do anything else for me- I was finally given the choice of a \"recertified\" Vizio with 3D or a check for a few hundred dollars less than what I paid for the TV. Although the replacement TV would have been nice, I opted for the check because I had heard the 3D model still has this problem, and Vizio's support had been so awful I was tired of dealing with them at this point.It's possible a future firmware update could be sent out that corrects this problem, but it's gone on for 3 months so far and Vizio's \"support\" people obviously don't communicate with the people who actually design and program these TVs. If they had just told me \"We're aware of the problem and will issue a fix as soon as possible\" that would have been fine, but instead they denied there even was a problem and attempted fixes that did nothing and caused my TV to be taken apart unnecessarily.The funniest thing about all this is that I got this TV early through a \"VIP Program\" Vizio was doing, where they had supposedly selected a few people to get this TV early and give them feedback on it. I gave them plenty of feedback, but I don't know if it was ever listened to. At any rate, I would have expected a better line of communication with Vizio than what I got when this problem came up.I am searching for another brand right now. The thing I will miss most about the Vizio is its easily adjustable overscan settings, which allow you to zoom, stretch or crop the picture any way you see fit. I have one setting with absolute zero overscan, another which zooms in slightly to hide the black borders around the screen when my computer is being used, and another to zoom in on older 4x3 letterboxed movie transfers which display as a box in the middle of the screen on 16x9 TVs. I can also correct the picture if a DVD or online video is improperly stretched or squeezed.This was one of the first TVs to have internet apps, at first they were rather glitchy but most work quite well now. Vudu is the best, having close to DVD picture quality with Dolby 5.1 sound- although I was quite angered when Wal-Mart bought Vudu shortly after I got the TV and removed all the adult movies and other stuff that didn't conform with their \"values\". Netflix quality isn't the best, but it's a great value (much more so than cable) and has many older films that haven't been issued on disc before. Tune-In Radio is also great, you can listen to almost every online radio station on the planet. This includes Amazon VOD as well, but sadly my internet service isn't fast enough for it to work in \"HD\" mode. It only delivers 2-channel sound in the lower-quality modes. I'll have to see how it works with whatever TV I get to replace this one.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Like so many others....  backlight went out.....", "Author": "McDade TX", "ReviewID": "R3C809RMZC10WR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Purchased this TV from Amazon on 5-2-11, along with the 4-yr Square Trade warranty.  I did complete the warranty registration with Vizio on 5-10-11.  From the start, I had periodic mystery shutdowns (every couple of weeks) and sound cutoff for a few seconds (every couple of hours).  I made the assumption it was due to the Onkyo HT-S53300.  Then, on 4-4-12, like many others, the backlight problem hit.  On Saturday 4-7, spent time with their Tech Support who agreed this was a warranty item and then emailed my Amazon receipt to them.  After reading other reviews about getting warranty service, I took all the pictures to have ready to send.  On 4-14 I called back to followup on the case number, and to my surprise, they said they had what they needed and scheduled it for repair (didn't have to send in pictures).  I was expecting the worst, and got the best - - don't know if calling on a Saturday or completing the warranty registration at time of purchase made the difference, but I'm not complaining about their response THUS far.As far as the TV's performance, generally I was satisfied and willing to tolerate the minor glitches.  Picture was great, and enjoyed Amazon VOD under my prime membership.  Some of the Vizio apps crashed when I tried them, but I just deleted them as options because I was only using Amazons.Based on all the reviews citing quality problems, I have a feeling that as soon as my extended Square Trade warranty run outs, I'll have to replace it.

I dismissed it, thinking....\"I wouldn't want a knock-off brand TV\" and turned my nose up.  However, after extensive research, I was surprised to discover that the Vizio equalled, and in some areas, surpassed the Sony with the same features and specs.  The biggest price difference was obvious - the price!  The picture was the 2nd factor that helped me make up my mind.  Friends and family kept repeating...what a good picture...over & over again as we watched it.  The set-up was extremely easy and intuitive.  Even a non-techie type person could navigate thru it with no problem.  The on-screen menu almost tells you what to do and when to do it.  The sound is fine for me.  I don't like extremely loud volume on my TV, so maybe someone who wants to be blown out of the room would want to invest in something additional.

The problem came when my cable company shifted the digital channels from the ch700 range to the ch1000 range. The television only allows you to direct input channels with three digits. This is not an issue with my smaller, older Vizio TV which allows entry of 4 digits. I called support and they said it is a limitation of the tuner in my nearly brand new 55 inch TV. The solution is essentially to direct input a channel as close to 1000 as possible and then hit the up channel through all of the channels above 999 until you get to the one you want. This also means no jump/last feature to switch between two channels. Support was quick and polite could not offer any solution and said that there was no possibility of a firmware update to fix the problem. You might be okay if you use some other method of changing channels like a cable box and use the TV as a monitor for that device.In my opinion, my big new TV should be at least as capable as my older, smaller TV from the same company.

I selected no then it started to scan for channels then the screen went black... no menus or nothing but I could see the back-light was clearly on.Hmm.. so I wait a bit thinking perhaps this was normal but nothing came back up. I do a reset by unplugging it and holding the power button down. Turned it back on and still no menus or setup wizard. Now I'm sad. I can see the back-light clear as day and the logo was lit white.I called Vizio and explained what happened and the guy says that cant be good. He made me do another reset and try another outlet. Neither of those solutions helped. So he gave me two choices which was to have a repair man come out after I showed proof of purchase and quoted me it will take about two weeks. Or I could return it to Amazon. I said I would return it because in my mind I wanted my full 30 days to explore this television to make sure it was right for me.

We were granted a \"favor\" of getting a new remote but warned that if the problem persisted we would need receipt even though online reviews indicated that replacement of remote did not always work. Told this was industry standard which is not true in our experience for Apple, Sony, and Bose. Highly recommend stick with Sony or other brand because Vizio support is poor.", "Date": "May 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "Lisa S. Medina", "ReviewID": "R2DXY6T7QVFUKM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am really big on reading reviews before I make a big purchase. This TV had good ones. It is a piece of crap. We got in the TV and in 3 days it froze. I contacted Vizio and they walked me through reseting it. After that it turned on but there was a two inch thick line across the top of the screen. I didn't bother dealing with Vizio again so I called Amazon. They were great and sent me a new one. Once again the reason I say DO NOT BUY THIS TV, after 2 days every time the tv had been off for over 30 min. when you turned it on it froze and did its own reset. EVERY TIME!!!!!! After paying almost 1700.00 for a TV I want it to work correctly. We went with an LG 55LE5400 and the picture quality BLOWS THIS TV AWAY!Vizio seems to be the Kia of TVs.", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Like TV has major design issues", "Author": "keisannator", "ReviewID": "R3OEXWGEDDBOSA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Well I bought this TV and first off its not 240 HZ but 120 with an electronic upscale then love the remote but come on a remote that dosent light up also it has a picture in picture function but only with an component VIDEO  source  come i only use HDMI AND FINALLY THE VOLUME JUST STOPS SHUTS OFF AND THE ONLY REMEDY IS TO TURN THE TV ON THEN OFF", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Trust your own eyes.", "Author": "chanakya", "ReviewID": "R3DEJFRF459SJ4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was almost ready to pull the trigger and i just happened to go to costco and check the TV first hand.I saw that the picture was not having the clear \"pop up\" affect as some of the other TV's like the samsungs.I thought that its just Me and that probably it perhaps needed some the calibration.I checked online and found other people mention it as well.looks like its nothing to do with calibration.Thank god that i saw the TV personally.This is the second time i was fooled by excellent reviews.Nothing can replace your own eyes when it comes to deciding what is good for you.The matte finish on the tv gives the image a dull look.so if you can compromise for the crispness to get anti glare matte finish, go for it.If you have decided to buy this TV, Do go to nearby costco and check out the picture quality wrt to other TV's before buying.", "Date": "November 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Go look at this TV in A STORE!!", "Author": "ktnelson", "ReviewID": "REHPN6QVIQWI4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "All of the features listed make this TV seem like a great deal.  In fact on paper (or online) Vizios probably always looks like great deals, but don't make the same mistake I made - Don't buy unless you've seen it in person.  I purchased this TV based solely off Amazon reviews and what it seemed like I was getting for my money, but before the TV arrived I saw it in store, next to a Sony LCD and a Samsung LED.  The picture on the Vizio looked horrible in comparison.  The Sony LCD looked 10 times better than the Vizio and the Samsung was in a whole different class.  Now I know people who typically buy aren't concerned with the \"best picture available\" but this isn't close. Don't let people who already own the TV to tell you you need to fine tune all the settings to get a decent picture - that's just pathetic.  Go in to a store and look for yourself.  I can almost guarantee you purchase something else.  Needless to say I returned the Vizio and bought a Samsung.
