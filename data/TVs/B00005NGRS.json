I would like to say I did a lot of investigative work before i settled on the Toshiba 50A61. For the price ,quality looks workmanship I'm very happy about my purchse. I looked at HDTV,Wide Screen and all brands checked Best Buy, Sears, Wal-mart you name it ..But the picture is so clear and the features are some of the best for this price range.. I would suggest this television to anyone not looking to spend on the high end and still have a tv set that is top notch..you can't go wrong ...", "Date": "January 24, 2002"}, {"Title": "nice buy not over price", "Author": "E", "ReviewID": "R1CYW9YLWEGC6V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Most clerks in the big box store will push you to buy hdtv wide screen. They are great but there is so little programming to see and the little there is requires a \"STB\"  that cost 700 buck. Add in Dish or direct tv plus to access local hdtv station you must put a antenna on you roof. So i  compared the major brand  look at the non hdtv by sony, mit and panasonic. I felt the tosh is cheaper by hundreds of dollar. Also has the best picture to me but you really can't tell until you set it up in your home. Mine's look great even on cable.You can find this tv online or check at bb after a holiday maybe as low as 1100.", "Date": "December 22, 2001"}, {"Title": "My Own Movie Thearter", "Author": "Naomi Holness", "ReviewID": "R1YKAD9AVTG4O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Its great!!!
