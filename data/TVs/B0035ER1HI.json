I then did my research on my blu ray player(my Playstation 3).  Turns out the Playstation 3 only does 60hz or 30hz, and on most games only does 720p.  So with no intent on up-grading blu ray players this tv was an excellent choice, I have no regrets at all.  Just watched Avatar on blu ray, looked awesome!!! no \"blurring\" or anything like the 120hz and up snobby crowd would have you believing with their tales of imaginary blurring and ghosting.  Works great with hdtv and my 1080p laptop.  I tweaked the picture settings to my likings, I suggest you do this too to get the most out of it, a helpful hint, the best colors to do this is with red, black and white, if you get those 3 colors looking good the rest fall into place.", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "My first LCD and first Sony Tv", "Author": "Elder 010", "ReviewID": "RW5R9N585G6J6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV 3/1/10. Did the usual research most people do before buying a large screen TV. When compared, side by side, toother major brand tvs, the set's picture quality was at least as good if not better than anything out there. The colors were vivid and life-like with excellent clarity. As I don't watch many sporting events, I decided that the 120hz refresh rate in the more expensivemodel wasn't needed and, I was right. At home, after a fifteen minute setup, the picture is great and the sound is more than adequatefor watching programing from your local cable outlet(in my case Comcast). The only feature I miss from the more expensive model is the swivel base, but I can learn to live without it. For the typical couch potato, this tv fits the bill perfectly!", "Date": "May 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "W. Eppick", "ReviewID": "RW7532OQMG70U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is our first flat panel TV, so maybe we are over enthusiastic about it.  It's great!  Nice crisp image and the digital tuner brings in off-the-air signals more solidly than we've experienced before.  The controls are fairly clear and the remote is good.  All of the automatic features work as advertised.  The only down side was that when feeding it from our 4 year old Toshiba DVD player, there were 2 to 5 second black gaps where it seemed to be catching up with itself.  We were running the signal in using component video connections.  We contacted Sony's email help and they were pretty useless.  The first thing they wanted me to do was to upgrade the firmware to a version one before the one currently installed.  Once we got that straightened out I was given a 800 number to call.  Been there, done that!!  So instead we dropped by Costco and picked up a Sony Blu-Ray/DVD player on sale and --- life is good.  I'm now connected via HDMI.  Great connection.The only other (small) trouble is that the remote has the usual directional buttons in a circle with an outer circle of system controls.  The spacing between the circles was definitely designed by someone with small hands.The 60 Hz refresh rate seems to be no problem.  If there is motion blur its so minimal I can't see it.  (Also, I'm not particularly looking for it.)On balance this is a great set, but if you have an old DVD player you want to use with it you may have to upgrade to a current model that can output via HDMI.", "Date": "December 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "B. Hall", "ReviewID": "RRUCMQZR6T9G0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After looking at several 1080p LCD HDTVs, including models from LG, Samsung and Sony, I decided to go with the KDL-46EX400. I've had the TV for a couple of weeks now and couldn't be happier with my purchase.I've purchased a number of Sony video products over the years b/c of the excellent images that Sony products usually have, but I still look into other brands when buying something new. In this case, I still ended up going with Sony because of price, image quality, and features.The picture quality of 720p, 1080i, and 1080p is excellent on this TV, and is as good or better than other HDTVs that I've used. And, although I wasn't expecting much from SD sources, I can honestly say that SD programs look much better than I expected them to, and have better picture quality on the KDL-46EX400 than SD sources displayed on other HDTVs that I've seen.I am also happy with the USB port that is built directly into the TV. It allows playback of MP3 audio, displaying of pictures, and playback of MPEG-2 video (as long as the file extension is .mpg) directly from the USB drive. This is a nice added feature that allows us to watch digital video files simply by converting them to MPEG-2 and then connecting the USB drive containing the files to the TV.The only negative I've experienced is that the TV stand is very flimsy, but this won't affect me since I'll be using a wall mount. Other reviewers have complained about the remote, but I've found it to be neither bad nor great, and since I'm using a different universal remote, this doesn't affect me in any way.Overall, a great TV with excellent image quality and good features.", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Terrific picture, fair sound, underwhelming remote and tuner", "Author": "J. Lee", "ReviewID": "R1KIDVSHDIAFK4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "PROS: excellent picture, aesthetics pleasingCONS: cheesy remote, inferior tunerThe picture quality is superb on the 46\" EX400 -- crisp colors, sharp images, and no obvious dead pixels. The motion blur, even on sports, is not readily apparent, so the 60 Hz refresh rate represents a good value. Optimizing the picture from factory settings didn't need much adjustment, as decreasing the Backlight to 1 was enough for me (your eyes may vary).  And the gray bar on the bottom of this TV looks terrible on the website, but in real life, it actually looks quite attractive overall. FYI, the black border is quite glossy, if you're OK with that. (Don't worry, the screen itself is matte.)The sound is decent -- my TV sits on a cabinet, which may make the sound more bearable than those mounting it on a wall.  Since my setup connects the DVD/BluRay to the stereo, the built-in sound is relevant only when tuning in OTA channels or playing game components plugged directly into the TV.The remote control feels cheap and not up to the usual Sony standards, but it's functional. There's a little lag with tuning to channels via the antenna, which is balanced out by the useful program info up top (this can be turned off if you like). Probably the most glaring deficiency is the sensitivity of the tuner -- when compared to a 32\" LCD from a competing brand (starts with a P, ends with a C) sitting in the same location, this Sony had a hard time picking up several channels using identical rabbit ears.  Fortunately, new rabbit ears upgraded to a version highly rated at the local big-box electronic store fixed this problem up nicely.Overall, it's a solid buy for the price.", "Date": "July 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Broken just over one year", "Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "R24XBOTVVOM1CW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the typical Sony product, that it broke just over one year of warranty.

It was manufactured in Mexico dated August 2010. If you watch a lot of sports, I suggest you do NOT get this TV. I clearly see the fuzziness on the players. More when they go faster or up close. A Panasonic TV I had bought more than 5 years ago still has a superior picture to this TV. For the price, it is reasonable for its included features. If you expect a lot from this Sony TV, you will be dissappointed as I was. On its Vivid mode, the picture is not as bright as Panasonic or Samsung. Its PIP is hidden somewhere. You have to use its PC mode, which I still have not figured out yet. The remote controller is very no frills looking. Sony has decided to produce a generic TV. Shame on Sony for a taking a step backward. Remember, you get what you pay for. Buyer beware. Check out this TV before you buy it. You may or may not like it. Maybe I just expect too much from the Sony reputation. The price tag does not lie. If I can return or swap this TV, I will and pay more for something else. One positive on this TV, I can access my DVD player connected to it, from the Sony remote controller.Updated review on Aug. 02, 2013:TV green power light comes on, but no picture. I wiggled the connector plug to TV, it sometimes gives the picture. After turning off the TV, green power light stays on. Same process again when turning on TV again.

Three of them are Sony's.  I am happy with all of them including this one.  I realize that this is a low end model.  I don't see much value in spending the extra money for a 120hz TV.  Additionally,  unless you have Verizon Fios (as I do in my other home) you wont really be able to see a significant difference.  Here in south Florida. we have Comcast.

I am very impressed with the picture quality. The colors are vivid and the picture is clear. The blacks are still a problem as in most LCDs. The TV is very easy to use and it auto detects other SONY systems connected to it (Sony Bravia Auto-Sync feature).There was a major difference while viewing regular TV versus Blu ray movies. Because of the large TV size I noticed pixelations with the analog reception. If you have digital cable this should not be a problem.Two minor issues, were the remote that did not have too many functions. In my case I have the Sony A/V receiver and Sony blu-ray player, so my receiver remote compensated for this stripped down version that came with the TV.

Next to the top 4 groups there are many followers like, pretty good quality's Taiwanese Chimei, a bit lower quality's \"exclusively\" made for BB by mainland Chinese Dynex, Insignia, and low-priced PRC's Haier, etc.....My old Taiwanese brand Olivia 30-inch flat LCD TV now is a bit outdate (I spent ~$1,200 for it), so I decided to look around the black Friday's deal for a new bigger TV. I bought this TV because of its farely low price of $700-, and for the famous Sony brand, after I failed grab the $298 black Friday's Target 42\" Westinghouse LCD TV (post- tax and disposal fee in Calif, the final price raised to around $355), and gave up the not-so-good sales from Walmart's $398~$448 Emerson or LG deal. I thought that a LG 42\" cost me $530 after tax, why not add $160 more to get a much famous brand and bigger 4\" more inch screen size, so I bought this one. After 2~3 weeks, local Fry's store selling LG 47-inch 120Hz TV for $599 (after tax etc. then is $680), and Sony 46-inch 120Hz (model -EX500) same priced $599, but I can't get it due to the early bird limited quantity (I don't know it is true or not as Fry's sales said so). Umm, I was a bit upset on my deal for the price to buy an outdated 60Hz TV!The TV generally gives a pretty clear (I won't use the word \"sharp\" picture to describe it), rich vivid color on major channels, but lousy definition on picture sharpness and color from local small TV channel/stations. The sound/speakers is very plain, low quality, not a Dolby or multi-channel, boost bass etc., if you expect it when watching movies as you thought it should deliver a home-theater effect, then you'll disappoint! When play back of VCR recorded tape from local non-720p/1080p/480SD TV channel programs, the picture quality is terrible bad, although, the tape recording is one of the major source for foreign language program. I'm ok for the slow reacted remote control unit, because I know Sony's remote unit typically not good: I still own a Sony Trinitron 25-inch XBR CRT TV ($1,300+ bought 20+ years ago), that TV color still super good after 20+ years, but that remote unit dead at on/off switch just 1 year after I bought the TV, so I know Sony's remote usually very bad quality as I learned experience 20 years ago.The most concern or complain of this TV is, it all of a suddenly shut off itself for 1~2 seconds, no picture on screen, just the grey-green color page, then, reinstate picture after black-out, when I started use it for the first 2~5 weeks! I don't know is it a defect, or circuit protection device (not mentioned on manual anywhere), or it is just a burn-in period (if it has one) symptom, but my feeling is so bad: comma, it's a Sony big 46-inch LCD brand new TV! The TV is so big and chunky, so there is almost no way can return it to Amazon, and I don't know how much the return fee, who will pick it up for return, and who needs pay the fee, so I enforced myself to keep the TV not returning it back. So far that glitch-outrage nightmare been not reproduced after 1~2 month use it, I hope it gone forever. The 60Hz blur DID showed when object in motion, not necessary just showed on high-speed sport motion, it also showed at a lower-speed object motion, but I guess you can ignore it, if you are not on purposely picky to watch that blur spot try to critize the 60Hz. For the price/performance, plus the past years of brand reputation and trackable history, this Sony is avg. and acceptable. I won't trust a Samsung or LG, because they are not long history enough can be tackable on reliability, although vivid rich color when it's brand new, after 2~5 years don't know is it still good, and where to find repair or spare parts instantly and locally?One side complaint is to Amazon: Amazon has TV price guaranteed ads on its website, but, Amazon doesn't tell you that price guarantee is for certain, limited model only! When you receive a heavy chunky large screen TV shows either price not right or defect/malfunction on TV itself, then you contact Amazon and get refusal on price match for your model, or not clear on the return TV policy, you'll be frustrated!", "Date": "February 9, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "46-inch LCD HDTV with full HD 1080p resolution lets you take full advantage of HD sources like a Blu-ray Disc Player or PlayStation3 gaming console\nAmbient Sensor and LightSensor technologies automatically adjust the color and backlight based on a room's lighting\nUSB port for photos, music and video playback; Wi-Fi adapter ready; BRAVIA Sync controls compatible devices with one remote\nInputs: 4 HDMI, 2 component, 2 composite, 1 PC, 1 USB, 1 optical digital audio output\nIncludes removable stand; measures 44.38 x 28 x 11.625 inches with stand", "Name": "Sony BRAVIA EX 400 Series 46-Inch LCD TV, Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51okfTTFy4L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0035ER1HI"}}
