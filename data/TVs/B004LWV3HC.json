{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Love this television!", "Author": "Jeffrey Struss \"chemist/electronic music freak\"", "ReviewID": "R2MQD5A0B9393X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK, I love this television. It is completely silent, cool running, amazing picture (after adjusting the settings properly) and had all of the features I wanted for a price point that couldn't be passed up.Pros:* 3 HDMI ports* Silent even with my ear right next to the set* Rotatable stand (my wife hates being off center but her chair is far to the left so she can rotate it to face her)* Decent speakers (get loud enough but nothing mind blowing but not bad either)* NO BLUE LEDs, infact when the set is on NO LEDs are on at all. Just a small red one for standby which turns off when the set turns on* Loads of advanced settings available without having to enter into locked service menus.* Picture is bright in my opinion (not LED TV bright but more than enough for my needs)* Price (paid 6 c-notes during Fry's easter deal)* Super fast response time (no lag at all in any games)* No real burn-in issues even with games being played (after the first 100hr burn-in time where static images were avoided).* After calibration great rich blacks.Neither here nor there:* Touch sensitive buttons on front panel (cool as hell but can be a bit annoying trying to hit a button in the dark).* USB video and pictures (don't really use this at all)Cons:* No bells and whistles (not a con for me but maybe for others).* Like any shiny TV glare is an issue.* Settings out of the box leave something to be desired at best.* Not 3D (once again I didn't want this but for others this maybe a con).Now with all of that said, if you don't use a good advanced calibration profile this TV can be pretty off on the picture at points (whites a bit yellow, over saturation on certain colors, dim screen etc.). I used the calibration settings posted by blacknoir at the avsforum and then did the picture wizard to tweak it a bit further and the difference is nothing short of incredible. Crisp whites, excellent contrast, skin is the proper color, etc. This set became by far the most natural looking set I have seen in a long time. Now mind you this natural looking set wouldn't sell in stores next to the heavily over exposed settings they use to catch your eye. It wouldn't help if I talked about all of this without posting my settings for you. So here we go.If I have any comments or explanations I will post them next to the setting. Also, these will not replace the quality of a professional calibration because all panels are slightly different. That being said this will get you pretty close.Settings used:Aspect Ratio: 16:9Energy Saving: OffPicture Mode: Expert 1 (Expert 2 is fine as well, these are just 2 slots to store an advanced profile and access the advanced settings)Contrast: 77 (will likely change after Picture Wizard but this is a good starting point)Brightness: 53 (will likely change after Picture Wizard but this is a good starting point)H.

This part is a bit confusing in how it is implemented. Basically, each time you select an IRE value treat the values below it as a new set of values. Why they did it this way I have no clue. Anyways here are the values (as you will see some are REALLY far off):Also incase you can't figure it out r=red g=green b=blue.5  ire  r=0  g=0  b=010 ire  r=-16 g=0  b=-3615 ire  r=0  g=0  b=020 ire  r=-17 g=-13 b=-3425 ire  r=-9  g=0  b=-3730 ire  r=-6  g=9  b=-2935 ire  r=0  g=0  b=-1340 ire  r=9  g=17  b=-2545 ire  r=0  g=0  b=050 ire  r=-10 g=0  b=-4255 ire  r=-18 g=0  b=-1060 ire  r=15  g=20  b=-3765 ire  r=-18 g=0  b=070 ire  r=5  g=30  b=-3175 ire  r=-9  g=9  b=-2980 ire  r=-6  g=19  b=-5085 ire  r=0  g=0  b=090 ire  r=-8  g=16  b=-995 ire  r=0  g=0  b=0100ire  r=-5  g=0  b=-24Red color 0Red tint -1Green color -6Green tint 0Blue color -8Blue tint 0Yellow color -5Yellow tint 11Cyan color -2Cyan tint -2Magenta color -3Magenta tint -10There we go. As you can see it will take some work to enter these in. Don't forget after entering these to run the picture wizard to tweak the brightness and contrast and stuff. After all of this you will have an AMAZING lifelike set.PS: All TVs should have this done because even the best TV makers design their presets to sell the TVs not to have the most natural look (vivid sells in the store but looks like crap at home).EDIT: In response to a question to this review: Film Mode will only be available if the source material is 1080p or 1080i. Any other resolution will cause the Film Mode option to be blurred out. So in that case just ignore it.EDIT2 (1/72011): THe user computertech pointed out a typo in my calibration settings list.

I called the next morning, ordered the HD, flipped on ESPN and was absolutley dazzled. The picture is crisp, clear, vibrant, and just looks uttlerly amazing. I am not a big 3D fan, so the basic model was more than enough for me, and for the price, the value is amazing. Regarding glare, I have read prior reviews that this is a problem with LG tvs, I have mine in a basment with windows so there is quite a bit of light andi was worried, but much to my delight ,the is glare is very minimal. As far as the menu and adjustments they are both very easy to use, I just keep the itelligent sensor on most of the time and it provides a very accurate picture, sometimes a tad too dark, but usually its right on. Sound is also decent from what I can remeber for the first night, but I have soundbar hooked up so I havent experiences too much on that.

Im a videophile and am a picky person when it comes to my tv's.  This is the 3rd set ive owned in 2 years.  The first was an lg 1080p 55 inch, well that's went south quick because fast moving images would become blocky so I took it back.  Then I bought a 32 1080p sony LCD and it the picture looked good somtimes but most of the time it had blotchy colors and terrible shadow details no matter what setting you used, then the screen started to band (dark lines on it).  Then I went to samsung LED and the back light bleed in all corners ruined movies for me the tech came to fix it and made it worst, took it back the next day.Ok so I went looking for a new plasma, which ive heard always made movies look better, and plasmas are favorites by most people who watch a lot of movies. Ive always been scared off by the burn in effect.  So after a lot of research I got this one the price and picture was I was looking for.  I will say this on the picky side of things for movie lover.  The 16x9 black bars you see on most films with not be pitch black, they are VERY close but no matter what ya you do they will be a few shades off.  They are even in color and it doesn't bother me compared to the LCD/LED ones that are black in the middle and grey on the ends.  Also this tv has some sort of Fluid motion tech built into it, much like 120 hz Lcds have it makes the motion more fluid.  No plasmas don't need this because they work differently, but LG must think people want movies to look more life like, but the fluid motion ruins movies and makes them look cheap and make the motions look too fast for their own good.  My only complaint is I don't know how to turn this feature off.  I see a film mode option, but it wont let me select it??????  The image colors are rich and sharp and if you tweak them you will find what your looking for.It does have burn in protection options, no problems with any burn in, but im careful and dont leave static images on for very long. Now let me give you a heads up on ghosting/ image retention.  Sometimes if you leave for ex: a dvd menu with static images on for about 5-10 minutes and then you go to a dark screen you will seen some of that menu still. DONT BE SCARED, this will go away within a minute and is normal, its just the phospers fading away and as soon as another images comes on the screen it washes all the old stuff off, it will NOT effect the pic quality.  So after 2 LCDS AND 1 LED I went to plasma and am finally happy with the sturdy quality of the screen and the 600 hz the tv has to offer, no more shuttery images and back light bleed.", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV, but glare *is* an issue in brighter rooms", "Author": "KeithV", "ReviewID": "R12HQ32ETS63YN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just bought this TV from amazon.com yesterday and spent most of today with it.  Here are my top of mind comments, hopefully they can be helpful to others considering this HDTV.PROS:+  A Good Value.  The price/screen ratio - as well as the features - are simply unmatched (especially compared to LED/LCDS of a similar size).+  Picture Quality.  The picture quality is also very good.  Vibrant colors, easy to adjust picture with advanced user controls.  Only took me about 5 minutes of tinkering to find a setting that works well.+ Thinner than most plasmas of late.  This HDTV is pretty thin and many will be surprised it's a plasma (it looks more like LCD/LED thin, which is a good thing).+  Highly rated Quality/Reliability.  I checked out the latest consumer reports ratings and LG - along with Panasonic - receive the highest ratings in terms of quality and reliability in the plasma TV space.CONS:- Glare.  No surprise here if you've read the other reviews on this site and elsewhere.  But I do want to put this into context.  It's not a deal breaker, it's more of an occasional distraction.  Let me explain:My TV is in my living room which has two big windows, one on each side of the TV.  With the blinds mostly closed, glare is only occasionally a problem when the tv has an bright image, but in darker scenes, if you look closely, you CAN often see your reflection in the TV.  (I have only a wall behind me, no lights).Most of the time this is not a big deal but this can be kinda distracting if the movie you're watching is dark.  I find myself having to close my blinds completely - even during the day - if I want to completely eliminate the glare - something I've NEVER had to do with my 50\" Panasonic Viera plasma (2009) also with no anti-reflective screen.  This is why i dropped one star from the otherwise stellar HDTV.BOTTOM LINE:Would I have re-bought this TV if I could do it all over again?  Yes. But with two caveats:1.  If they had put an anti-reflective screen on this TV it would have been one of the best TV's in the value space.  As it stands, I'd rate this tv in the 85th/90th percentile for this size and price.  The glare really is the only issue, and as issues go, it's a pretty minor fault espcially since it can be resolved by controlling the light in your room.2. I kinda wish I had upgraded to the LG model with the built in netflix (LG PZ550).  I currently use my ps3 for netflix streaming but only recently learned my ps3 (original) uses 197 watts to stream, versus just using the HDTV (no additional power needed) or apple tv (6 watts) or roku 2 (at 2-4 watts).  This would have saved me money over time in energy savings.  Something I wish I had considered with this TV.", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "great tv", "Author": "K. Sheehan", "ReviewID": "R3S6QX43A0JTXV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very happy with my new TV.  The price is great and so is the picture quality.  I use a stereo sound system for the sound so cannot rate the sound. There is a little glare, but no more than I had with my old rear projection HD tv.  In fact, there is less glare.  I was very pleased that my Harmony remote was very easy to set up with this tv.  I have programmed 4 tvs now with the Harmony and this was by far the easiest.  I did not need the internet apps because I have a PS3.  The movies on the PS3 are great.  Also, I had not interest in 3D. So if you do not need those extras, I highly recommend this TV.  By the way, the Tv has 3 HDMI's.  One is on the side and 2 in the rear.  If you look at the manual on line, it shows an \"S\" video outlet.  It does not have the \"S\" video outlet.", "Date": "June 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Remember to turn off the \"Energy Saving\"!!!", "Author": "Deshen", "ReviewID": "R14G4PBZP4MM1D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I want to tell all people who gave this tv very negative reviews:Remember to turn off the \"Energy Saving\"!!! By default, it's on, after turning it off, for sure you will get another \"brand new\" HDTV completely different immediately, which looks vivid, gorgeous and crystal clear!Pros:It has 3 hdmi ports which is enough to me, 1 for the set-top-box, 1 for the media player like apple tv or BD player and 1 for the video game console.Because my laptop doesn't have hdmi output, I use VGA cable to connect them, under the nature resolution of 1920*1080, the \"giant monitor\" looks very sharp and clear.For the TV part, it's great as well, my tv service provider is Verizon FIOS, all HD channel are presented with crystal clear and vivid video quality, after setting the video output format in STB from 720P to 1080i, it looks even better! I'm a big sports fan, European Champion Leagues final, French Open and NBA all are fantastic, literally without any motion-blur.The sound quality of this TV is above average, it's loud and clear without any noise. For normal user, it's good enough.The appearance of this TV is beautiful, it's very slim and thin, more like a LCD TV than plasma.Cons:The screen is reflective, must turn off the lights behind you otherwise you get them in your TV :(Plasma burn-in exists, after seconds still screen, it's easy to find the \"ghost shadow\" when the screen turns to black, but it's not a big problem, the shadow is not permanent, it's gone fast.The PC audio volume is lower than hdmi audio volume, I need to adjust it when I switch audio input between PC and hdmi, it's really annoying.I got this TV from Fry's for only 599 plus 120 shipping, comparing with other brand and model, it's absolutely worth every dollar you spent,it's very hard to find any other TV with similar size, specification and quality for less than 600 bucks. I strongly recommend 50PV450 to all users who are trying to find a good HDTV without any fancy functions like 3D enable, wifi and app build-in. Again!

It's not TERRIBLE either, as another reviewer might have you believe.  In fact I am very happy with it.  I am not a professional calibrator or anything like that.  I am however, a very critical person.  The picture of this TV is rather nice.  There is no doubt that image retention occurs, and fairly quickly.  However it fades just as fast.  Really a non issue in my opinion.  Would it be better if it did not occur at all?  Of course.  But, like I said, it's minor and fades quickly.  As far as the colors and overall picture, I think they look quite good.  I have my TV and Blu-Ray inputs set to Cinema with Contrast 57, Brightness 50, Sharpness 50, Color 64, Dynamic Color and Contrast set to OFF, Color Gamut set to STANDARD.  It's a little dim, but I like it that way.  Your eyes will adjust after watching it for a minute, and this should extend the life of the TV.  My HDMI input for my Xbox 360 is set to Game, and slightly different but similar settings.  A touch brighter and more colorful.  I think it looks great all around.  Could it be better?  Sure, but most people will be very pleased with this set at this price range.  One note of importance, the glare is pretty serious.

That alone makes this a great value and there is a marked improvement in image quality, and the Samsung was no slouch.  Pulling some image settings from a leading online message forum has allowed me to get an outstanding picture on this LG.Maybe because I'm not a TV snob who purchases a new TV every year -- my priorities may be more in line with most people -- I am very satisfied with the set.

I bought the TV for $1140.21 from Amazon, and then got a refund for $55.22 when I applied for the Amazon price match on TVs (read their policy for details).A bit about my buying process: I knew that I wanted to go with plasma over LCD because plasma provides a better picture in terms of both image reproduction and fast-moving objects. I also did not need any app capabilities, because I have a PS3 that is connected to the TV and I can get any apps I might need on there. This brought me to look at the LG 60PV450 and the Panasonic VIERA TC-P60S30 as my top two candidates. After reading reviews on both models here on Amazon (there were only a few on the LG at the time) and in Consumer Reports (last years models of the same TVs), I eventually chose the LG because it was rated higher in almost every category and it was less expensive (about $350 less when I bought in mid-August 2011).Let me say that I am extremely happy with this purchase and my choice of this LG over the Panasonic. The picture quality is superb, especially when viewing Blu-rays on my PS3. I also like that LG gives you very thorough controls for adjusting the picture to the optimal settings. I have not used all of them yet because I do not have a video tuning Blu-ray disc at the moment, but I did run the built in Picture Wizard, and I've seen a noticeable positive difference in the picture since I did. I know that plasma TVs can change a bit during the first 100 hours of use, so I waited until about 150 hours before running it, but even until then I had a good picture. I cannot wait until I buy a tuning disc in the next few weeks or so, and really get into the nitty gritty (though not the service menus) of the picture settings to milk the best possible picture out of the TV.Another concern I had was using the TV for gaming, but I have had no issues. I am not a hardcore gamer, but I do play a variety of games on my PS3 (e.g., NCAA Football 10, NHL 11, Uncharted series, Metal Gear Solid 4) and Wii (e.g., Goldeneye, NBA Jam, New Super Marios Bros Wii, Mario Kart Wii) and I have not had any problems. I do not notice any lag, and I have no issues with image burn in. There is some very minor image retention after I play NCAA Football 10 because EA chose to make their logo completely stagnant in the lower lefthand corner whenever you are actually playing a game, but that disappears after about 10 minutes of changing back to cable or a Blu-ray and really isn't noticeable unless you are looking for it. For example, I know that it is there for a few minutes after playing a game, but my wife cannot see it at all. This is not permanent damage to the TV, just a (very) briefly lingering artifact that is a fact of life with plasmas. My only word of warning would be to avoid playing many games during the first 100-200 hours of use if you are really worried about burn in (that is true of any plasma, not just this one). There are plenty of suggestions out there on the web on how to move through this \"break in\" period as quick as possible so you do not miss out on much gaming.At the moment I do not have the TV connected to a surround system or even a sound bar (my Pioneer VSX-1021-K 7.1 Home Theater Receiver ($400) should be arriving from Amazon today, and I'm going to connect it to an Energy 5.1 Take Classic Home Theater System ($400) when I buy them next month), but the internal speakers will suffice in the meantime. They are by no means great speakers, but they work in a pinch. I've watched several Blu-rays with \"big\" audio effects since purchasing the TV, and the speakers have done an OK job with the material in my small living room. As several other reviewers have mentioned already, if you are worried about the quality of the speakers built into a big screen HDTV, you really should think about it again. These kinds of TVs are designed to produce a stellar picture and leave the audio processing and playback to a receiver and home theater system. And really, what good is a big TV if the audio quality is bad. I bought this TV to immerse myself in the content, and that cannot be done with the internal speakers. Use the money you save buying this TV over more expensive (an not necessarily better) models to buy a good home theater (like the one I mentioned earlier).The last comment I will make is on the remote that comes with the TV. It is a well designed remote that is easy to use by feel and has a backlight for dark environments. I do not have a lot of experience using the remote, because I currently use my cable box/DVR remote from my cable company, but I have been happy with it when I need to use it. I am going to replace all of my remotes in a month or so with a Logitech Harmony of some flavor anyway. If you plan to use the stock remote, you will not be disappointed.In summary, the picture is superb; you can fine tune virtually any picture setting to your liking; the speakers are not great, but will do in a pinch or until you buy a receiver and home theater (which is true for any large HDTV); the stock remote is more than adequate for controlling the TV; and gaming performance is excellent, just be careful during the first 100-200 hours of use (as you should be with any plasma). I would recommend this TV to anyone looking for a large screen at an unbeatable price who does not need (or want) 3D capabilities or apps built into the TV.

Apparently not.The only other issue I would have, is with the colors.  With the default \"vivid\" setting on, it would take about a half-second for the vivid colors to apply themselves after a scene change.  So for example, if a video cut from scenery to a closeup of someone's face, the person's face would be a little washed out for a half-second, then it would apply the correct colors.  It took a little bit to notice it at first, but after that, it became VERY annoying.So I sent it back for an LCD display.  The blacks aren't nearly as good, but at least I don't have to worry about pausing a movie to take a phone call, and having that image burned into the screen the next day.", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Satisfied Customer", "Author": "rhw95", "ReviewID": "RM7D77XEZK072", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this TV.

I won't take stars off for this, because Amazon customer service was very kind and made several adjustments to the cost for me. The online tracking showed that the TV was picked up from an Amazon warehouse within 24 hours of placing my order. The target date of delivery was one week later.

I've heard a lot of good things about plasma displays, so decided to go for an 50-inch display that wouldn't kill my wallet. I also wanted to stick with LG as several friends and family members have LG TV, and all have given them rave reviews. The 50PV450 doesn't have a lot of information floating around about it on the net, but if you look closely, you'll see that it's definitely a sleeper hit among new plasma displays for those who don't want or need all the bells and whistles.First off, as some have mentioned, this is a refresh of LG's PK550 line of TVs. Take a look on Google, and you'll find a lot of favorable reviews for the PK550, and the PV450 is the same TV with a different model number for 2011. It doesn't have 3D, internet apps, or all of the other worthless geegaws that the \"top shelf\" models have these days. I couldn't care less about 3D (a worthless gimmick for 50 years and running!), and I have a media center computer that does everything that built-in apps can do, plus a whole lot more. What the PV450 does have is a crisp, clear, bright picture with zero motion blur, and that's what I DO care about. The picture on this TV is truly a thing of beauty. Even with brightness at 50 and contrast at 60 (which I'm keeping it at for the first hundred hours for the break-in period), it still looks great. As others here have mentioned, make sure to turn off the energy saving features, as it really does make a big difference with the picture quality.It's not flawless, of course. The screen does have quite a bit of glare, but with the curtains closed, it's not that noticeable. It's best to keep the TV in a darker area of the house where you can control the lighting. If you're thinking of putting it in an area with a lot of light that can't be blocked or turned off, you'll probably want to look at a plasma with glare reduction, such as the PZ950. Also, the sound is kind of lacking, but that's true with pretty much any flat-screen display. Hook it up to a sound bar or home audio system, and you're good to go.Overall, I think that the PV450 is a great deal for the money, and if you're in the market for a TV that gives you a great picture for a bargain price, you should definitely consider it as well!", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV", "Author": "Joshua Hyatt", "ReviewID": "R32YAVCCCVZO3H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I debated for awhile on what type of TV to purchase.

I don't like spending lot's of loot for products that just aren't as advertised.  I find it incredibly frustrating bringing home a product only to be let down.  I pride myself on research and knowledge that I'm getting what I paid for and more importantly, paying for what I expect.  That said, I am not a huge videophile, audiophile or anything \"phile\" for that matter.  Flat out, it's lame.  I have better things to do.  I do know what I like and won't settle for less.  Also, I have never written a review before, so expect this to be a bit long-winded.So, I've been pretty much in TV limbo for a while now.  I had a Mitsubishi 52\" DLP for 5 years waiting for Plasma and LCD to sort themselves out.  Now, we have LED and who knows what else is in the future.  Either way, I've done extensive research on the \"add-ons\" that the TV mfg's are coming up with to make their products relevant year over year.I started shopping at Costco specifically for their very good return policy and sure glad I did.  They also have great prices too!I started out with a Sharp 60\" LCD/LED combo and good god, it had some terribly sharp still images.  I mean, the best I've ever seen.  Simply amazing.  The model was LC-60LE633U.  This was a great TV when presenting still images.  If only that's what we had televisions for, I would have been happy.  As soon as you start watching football, hockey, playing video games it was all over.  Soooo much ghosting.  I was really hoping LCD TV's had figured this out and I was suckered in by the great image, and great reviews over on the Costco website.Then, I went with a Panasonic Plasma... model # TC-60PS34.  This was another great TV but simply lacked the definition of the sharp.  Images were not nearly as bright, not nearly as crisp.  This TV did keep up with my video games I play semi-infrequently.  I just was not satisfied.  I kept it for a month, and finally said forget it, it's not worth my hard earned cash.  Especially considered my \"ancient\" DLP was a GREAT picture and great set in general.I started looking around at a Samsung and LG sets in the higher price bracket simply for their internet TV ready sets.  It then occurred to me that a lower tier + a WD Live drive would give me the combo I really want.  So, enter the Costco specific 50PV400.  This is the equivalent display as the LG 50PV450 with a few options I really couldn't care less of.  More over, I can't even tell you what they are.....  Finally to the review:This TV is amazing.  The shear crispness of the tele is fantastic.  The whites/blacks (contrast ratio) is unbelievable.  Even the definition is excellent.  Watching football today, I am able to make out blades of grass AS STAFFORD IS THROWING THE BALL.  That's something neither TV's I had before could do.  There has been zero ghosting either which is an attest to LG's response time of their plasmas.  Way good.Really not sure what else to say, except I purchased the 50PV400 at $699.99 on 10/15/11.  The equivalent product here at Amazon (50PV450) is going for $721.09.  All-in-all, you really can't go wrong at this price point for this TV.  Really is the best bang for the buck.  I'm sure there are features that can be added, like Internet TV, 3D TV, black filtering etc, but honestly, for the average joe, who can notice.  It's the whole 80/20 principle, right?last point... I know I mentioned that the internet TV is something I sought after....

Also the menu's are very quick and easy to use so switching between settings is a breeze.This TV also comes with more connections vs the Panasonic, I don't really have a use or reason to have them all currently, but you never know if they'll come in handy in a few years. Also I read the Panasonic has only 900 Motion Picture Resolution lines vs the LG's 1080, not really sure what that means but in the category of resolution... more the merrier lol.Also I'd assume both TV's would perform dam near equally in terms of picture quality so that wasn't really a factor in my purchase.However the TV does look FANTASTIC, Plasma is definitely the way to go, LED LCD can go cry in some corner. Plasma for one does not seem to suffer from as much back-light bleed as LCD panels do which can ruin dark scenes, my TV as none from what I can see. So your going to get some pretty great black levels, also the viewing angle is INSANE, it's possibly better then my IPS HP LCD screen I have on my workstation, so you can be standing waaay off to the side of the TV and see everything clearly.It does have a glossy screen, and this is both a pro and con. Pro-s your colors will look much smoother, crisper, and richer. Con-s you will see reflections in dark scenes.... but turning off lights that are causing the reflection will remedy the problem.The menu is excellent, there's soooooooooooooooooo many options for you to fully customize and it's pretty easy to navigate and use. But the TOP reason for buying Plasma is NO SOAP OPERA EFFECT, everything will just simply look stunning, I avoided the 120hz+ LCD, LED LCD's like the plague for this reason...

Was almost expecting it after reading other reviews, but our windows w/ blinds turned shut do not present a problem at all.The sound is not great, but I plan to get an A/V receiver and surround sound speakers.

For us it replaces a 4 year old 42\" 720p LCD widescreen and the picture is noticeably better in the new TV. My wife was concerned the first TV would be too big for our room but she ended up being very glad we have it. She was concerned again the larger TV would be too much but she has admitted it is not that much bigger furniture-wise but much more impressive watching-wise. My daughter took one look and said wow, much better picture. That the new TV cost only 2/3rds of the old is pleasing to say the least-- and we still have the older TV to enjoy as a major improvement in our work-out room.If you are looking for an even better deal I suggest you don't fret if you can only afford a 720p version of this TV-- most of what we watch is at 720p and it is outstanding. We sit 10-12 feet from the screen and the truth is it is hard to see the 1080p difference from there-- though I do enjoy standing 4 feet from the screen and being amazed at 1080p detail!You also don't need to be concerned about burn-in on the new plasma screens. In the first month I noticed one such slight image but it was fleeting and does no long-term harm.

We were originally hesitant to get a plasma because the television is for our living room, which has a few windows on both the opposite and one of the side walls to the tv placement.  So hesitant that we originally purchased an LED edgelit tv (LG 47lv4400) a few weeks prior to this one. However, I was very displeased with the poor background uniformity on that television and also started finding quite a few owners of that model were starting to have power supply failure problems, so we returned it and grabbed the 50pv450 for about $50 more and were amazed at the difference.Pros:*Great design: simple thin black styling with easily accessible touch controls on the front and a swivel stand*Very slim design, comparable to most LED style tvs and less than half as thick as my 2 year old Panasonic plasma I have in my bedroom*Easy to navigate remote/menu with tons of picture mode adjustments, allowing for very customizable white balance without getting into the service menu*Cool, quiet and effecient for a plasma*Fantastic image qaulity, rivaling LCDs/LEDs that cost 2-3 hundred more*No bright LED indicator light on while the tv is on*Very good sound for a tv that is only 2 inches thick*Awesome viewing angles (as true of any plasma)Cons:*Have noticed a little bit of Image Retention, but only after having a static image for about 20+ minutes and going straight to a black screen.*It is a glass screen so glare can be noticeable and too much light will wash out the blacks a little bit.I would recommend this tv for almost any buyer.  While this television does have glare and slightly washed out blacks in lighter situations, the picture on this tv is so nice that unless you have an all white room with large bay windows, I would still highly recommend this tv over similarly priced lcds.  Coming from a CRT TV in the living room and a plasma in the bedroom, I guess I just really like the look of a glass screen over lcd's matte screen.  As far as the IR, it seems to go away quickly with normal tv viewing.  I have only noticed the IR when I was looking for it in an all black screen and if you are careful with your screen for the first month or so and don't use vivid mode, it should never be a real issue.  In just the week that I have had it, I have noticed the tv is already getting more resistant to IR compared to the first day or two.  As far as calibration for this tv, you can really get into the details and I would highly recommend putting in Jeffrey Struss's settings from his review and tweaking from there, because they will get you very close to an accurate picture.  A couple suggestions I would have on his calibration would be to go into the hidden white balance slider and start with warm color temp and tweak it slightly cooler until you get perfect whites, and also use \"just scan\" aspect ratio for all hd viewing as it will have 1:1 pixel mapping, eliminating overscan.If you want to keep it simple and not bother with calibrating, I find the default \"Cinema\" video mode to still be a great picture that comes closer to what you would get from calibrating this television than the other presets.  Thanks for reading and also Jeffrey Struss for convincing us to get this model and I hope if you get this model, you can enjoy it as much as we have!", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "This TV is AMAZING!", "Author": "JP", "ReviewID": "R2ZQRAG3DSV7NE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After weeks of extensive research, I decided on this TV with an amazing price of $999 from Best Buy (for some reason I cannot write a review on their site).

I am in no way an expert on TV's as I just replaced a 15 year old Magnavox (27\"), so this was a HUGE decision and purchase for me. I was so confused by Plasma vs LED/LCD I was driving myself crazy.  I finally just went with what I truly wanted, which is this TV.  It was super easy to set up and the menus are easy to navigate (don't rely on the manual - it's useless).  The remote is very easy to use and understand.  For those of you who are concerned about picture quality, you can set it to many color options, such as SPORTS, GAMES, or CINEMA.  I chose CINEMA for everything.  It's flawless, but you can also tweak each aspect of the components of color to your liking.  You will not go wrong with this TV.  As I sit watching my #1 beloved Patriots play my much loved Broncos, I am sooooo happy I made this purchase.

Well after having 2 phillips lcd tvs that looked only okay, I can tell you that with minor tweaks that someone else on here posted this TV FAR surpasses all expectations, especially for the size and price.  I did a lot of research on plasmas and this particular tv and the newer plasmas you don't really have to worry about image burn in after 100hrs of use.  Plasmas used to be rated at only getting 60,000 hours but they have since upped that to 100,000 hours.  The picture quality is amazing!  Fast moving images and games have never looked better just make sure you use the (game) setting on the tv before you play games as your movie watching settings will be darker than what you will want for playing games, trust me on this.  The only negative thing I can say about this tv is that when you leave still images on the screen for minutes at a time and then switch to another screen you will see a ghost of what was there.  Its not an image burn but its the way plasma works, the next bright image will wash the ghost away.  Again, don't let this discourage you from getting this tv... say if I had my ps3 on at the main screen for say 5mins and then started a game you would see ghosts of all the xmb icons but they would wash away in about 10secs time.GET THIS TV!

So far, I love it. I play a lot of video games on it, watch movies, and hook it up to my computer. It's got a nice crisp display that has an auto adjustable brightness for when you're watching during the day or at night. This is of course an option you can turn off (I like my video games nice and bright ALWAYS).Only downfalls I can think of;1. I have a desk I sit in that is about 30 feet directly to the left of the tv along the same wall. I turn the tv to watch it from the desk, but the base doesn't swing that far around, so I have to twist the base on the tv stand as well to get it there.2. I do a lot of switching of inputs. Mainly between my game system and the cable box. There's a bit of lag in bringing up the inputs and selecting the right one (including a couple of clicks). There is a dedicated \"TV\" button on the remote that selects the TV input in one simple click. However, this chooses the coax line that once was the standard for tv input. However if you have this size of tv at 1080, I would think most people have an HDMI line coming in providing their regular tv channels. Thus rendering the snazzy little tv input selection button useless. And as far as I've been able to figure, you can't reprogram the button to choose any other input. I wish even the \"last\" button would work for quick switching between basically the only two inputs I use, but it doesn't.3. Glare. It's a plasma, I knew this is an inherent problem with plasmas.

I set the tv setting to Vibrant and I increased the brightness and contrast manual so it became \"user defined vibrance\". It works really well and looks amazing especially at night. It does have glare I can see my reflection in the tv but I can still see the picture so I don't really care. I recommend a 5.1 system. Im using the panasonic one for the sound system. The audio was a little light for a tv this big. Then I used Panasonic SC-HT940 Deluxe 5 DVD Home Theater System. and I have verizon fios. So if ur doing that setup you can use ur fios remote for everything. You just have to read the instructions for the verizon fios remote which is online. it tells you to enter codes so you can turn ur fios box, tv, and sound system box on all at once and turn them all off at once with the remote button. Then another code to make the remotes volume only control ur sound system volume(default is the tv speaker volume). You can even disable tv speaker which i did. It works great together. The black level is awesome its my first plasma theres like 3 black settings. the darkest one is clearly visible that its complete black. You can't go wrong with this tv. Just make sure that you hookup ur fios box to ur tv with HDMI1. then go to the fios or cable box settings and make sure that you set it to 1080i. then ull correctly be getting 1080 picture. default was 720p for me and I thought something was wrong wtiht he tv. but you have to manual setting ur verizon fios box in its settings to output 1080i. 1080i is the same as 1080p in picture quality i read online so.

I mounted on the wall with the bottom of the screen being 34\" and titled down. Lighting the room from the screen side makes it great for night time use and day use requires me to close the blinds and acknowledge there will be some glare. It's perfectly watchable.

After searching for the last few weeks prior to its purchase, I found this TV to be exactly what I could hope for - 1080p resolution, plasma, large size, and price point.  The TV has pretty good contrast and I can see it well in a room that can, at times, have a good amount of light.  I'd say maybe not a lot of light relative to other people's homes (there's no window in front of it for about 8 feet), and I do use the shades when I watch TV, but it does its job.  Picture quality is pretty good - on BluRay the movies come off well (I do have some tweaking on the picture settings sometime soon still).  The price point is pretty good, too.  I set out to get a plasma after learning that the TVs don't consume as much energy what they used to (in fact, a lot less.  A plasma now is very similar, if not negligable, in the difference in yearly energy costs).  I should also mention that the TV has good standard speakers (I could certainly live with them, but I need that super base), 3 HDMI jacks (another requirement during the TV search) and the TV is handsome.  Other cool things: touch screen buttons and no annoying LED light that is on when you watch TV.So that's all the positives.  Before I get to the negative (there's just one), you should know that that I'm a light TV user (probably will watch at most 10 to 15 hours a week), but with an advanced knowledge in the tech behind it and the components I bought for it (I have a Sony Soundbar and a HTPC).  With that in mind this negative doesn't really bother me but it's moderately annoying.  The TV has residule image consistently and frequently, depending on the usage.  Going back to my HTPC (Home Theater PC) setup, when I'm playing a movie and I right click on the video for the menu the menu's image will stay there for a couple of minutes or longer.  Not overtly annoying and it's more of a \"ghost\", but it's there and I see it.  I'm fine with it, though, and I can certainly live with it.  You'll see it again when you are doing some TV menu modifications and you turn it to a light-colored TV channel.Overall, a lot of positives:- 1080p, brightness, good image quality, price, size, 3 HDMIs, good sound, plasma motion fluidity.Negative:- light residual image even during mundane tasks.Verdict: (I'm channeling a particular blog's format here) Buy", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice TV", "Author": "Ric Igal \"FatBoySE\"", "ReviewID": "R17EVI3VGN2CI9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like this new TV and the price was great.

This is the first Plasma I have owned (I aside frmo the LCD, I have a smaller LED in my bedroom).I will start off by saying that the picture quality is superb on this. I can notice the difference between this and my previous LCD - it is definately a step up with regards to quality.As other reviews have mentioned, the out of the box settings leave alot to be desired. With that being said, don't be afraid to play with the settings until you get a picture quality you like and are comfortable with - I played with mine for about 30 minutes to get it right, and tested it out on several different TV programs including sports, or just the news. Watching High Defininition video on this is amazing.The speakers aren't half bad, however I have a 5.1 surround sound I connected to the television so I'm not planning on using the built-in surround. But if you don't have surround, it's definately better then some of the speakers in the televisions out there.It is a heavy sucker - but of course it is 60 inches. I particularly like the swivle base, makes for better viewing since I sit at an angle (even though if the TV was straight I don't have a problem).While I don't considering the following a CON, I will make mention of it: the screen is made from glass, and is highly prone to glaring from room lighting or exterior lighting. I have read, here and on other review sites, that LG is horrible for larger screens having glare. After speaking with a few people, and discussing it with the associate at the store, the glare is a result of the glass screen (and part of the reason extended warranty is so expensive). I had minor glare on my LCD, however this has a higher extent of glare. So if you don't want glare, either don't buy it or position the lighting accordingly. But you will get this with any Plasma TV is my understanding.I have yet to test this with gaming (I have a PS3) or with Blu Ray movies - but it's definately on my list of things to do.Breakdown:Pros:* Amazing, crisp picutre* Good built in speakers (if you use them)* Great Price for what you are getting - don't think you can find a better deal.Cons:* Glare (this is minor for me, it may bug others or be a deal breaker for some)* No 3D (I didn't want 3D, but if you want a 3D model expect to shell out abit more)* Out of the box settings aren't the greatest (play around with it to get what you like, or if you don't know how many retails offer a calibration session, at a cost, where they will send someone to your home to get it all setup and calibrated for you)", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Plasma with motion blur", "Author": "P.

With a refresh rate of 600hz there should be none of that, waiting for a reply from LG but my expectations are low, we tried many different sources and nothing has helped.There aren't many reasons to buy a plasma honestly so a lazy screen is pretty much the last nail in the coffin for us.

Upgraded to this marvelous tv from a 50\" Panasonic plasma 720p & the differences are like night & day!!! There's no ghosting on bright or really dark scenes, like a shot of the sun or light bulb or underwater deepsea exploring where the Panasonic would show this gradation of the main image to the darkest or lightest part in the whole picture. This LG has it down perfect!! Setup was a breeze, but I find using the arrow keys on the remote a bit of a challenge, having to press them more than once to get the tv to respond & I'm only sitting 9.5ft away but persistence pays off! Used blacknoir's isf expert control settings & after watching Shark Island on NatGeo decided to do some more tweaking & only thing I needed to do was Tint R2 & Temp Color down from W30 to W10 & the images are nothing short of spectacular!!! It's almost like being there with such a large viewing area!! I'm absolutely tickled that I got this tv. Skin tones, lawns, everything... is spot on color-wise. Sharp, crisp clear viewing!! I'd recommend this tv to anyone wanting a bigger tv than the normal 46\" or 50\" & LG is a bargain compared to Samsung or Panasonic!!! Used the USB feature to play a slideshow of my favorite photos while listening to my fav music & was in awe. Nothing short of Nirvana lol. Not much can impress me these days, but LG & this tv has! My home theater is finally complete sigh...just be aware that the tv stand base is hidden in the styrofoam so don't freak like I initially did Ha!Update: 3 months in & have noticed a pronounced flicker when viewing satellite & the picture is predominantly white, white clothes or otherwise white background etc. Is quite annoying but oh well huh, seems they all do it. Not enuff to get me to dislike this tv, but enuff to downgrade it a star!! Bluray & standard dvd flicker as well. Found this write up by another customer:While contrast and brightness issues could be marginally improved by changing the settings, the flickering, white fall off, and ghosting remained. I unpacked the TV I ordered for my parents, and it had all the same problems. I tried changing my video source and using another type of input on the TV (RGB PC instead of HDMI), but the problems persisted.I called LG, and they eventually arranged for the service guy who finally came today. He agreed that all the problems I mentioned exist, and were not fixed by his one repair option: replacing the main board. I'm waiting to hear back from his boss on what my options are. I'm afraid that even if LG accept a return they'll want me to pay return freight for these two beasts. I think I'd rather try and sell these myself then exchange for another LG.So I've called LG & had them admit to a flickering issue with this model which the rep on the ph was reluctant to do, said they'd fix the tv & while I was hoping a main board replacement would fix the flickering, apparently it doesn't according to someone who's had that done ^.

Went to Sears to see it in person today (know, should have done that first!).In a word- it's TERRIBLE! I am an ISF-trained calibrator and former journalist for two Home Theater magazines. This plasma looks so bad compared to my 42\" Panasonic GT25 3D, I thought something was wrong with it. So I pulled up the adjustment menus to try and bring the dead back to life (clueless Sears salespeople wondering why I needed to do this), and they of course had the contrast cranked to 100.After correcting the contrast and brightness, it still looked bad. Dingy, dull whites, blacks that were not even charcoal gray dark, and a lifeless picture that did not 'pop' at all. So bad maybe something was even wrong with this sample of the set, but cannot speak to that. If it was a bad set, it should not have been on display.I am not a fan on Samsung, but there was a 32\" Samsung LED next to it which totally killed the LG in terms of contrast ratio and a natural, pleasing image with crisp whites and solid, inky blacks (note that the Panny 3D very well matches the LED in these regards). So long story short, I knew there was no way I'd be satisfied with the poor display quality of this set, called the other online retailer, they had already sent it out of their warehouse, so now I am out $164 shipping for it to go back to them.Lesson - look at the TV in person BEFORE you buy. I wish I'd gotten the 50\" Panasonic GT25 3D back when they were $879-899, before Panny jacked up the prices of this set by nearly 50% when the GT30 came out. It was my anger at Panasonic over pulling this price-gouging stunt that made me look for a different set for this 50\" purchase. Just wish very much I had purchased the 3D Panasonic before the price gouging.Anyone considering purchasing this plasma is HIGHLY advised to see the set in person before buying (and if you don't know how to adjust for proper picture, bring along with you to the store a copy of Digital Video Essentials or Avia and someone who knows how to use it.)Just wanted to put this on here, b/c if someone else had this same experience it would have saved me buying the set, and now being out the shipping cost.

Still, I went through a heck of a lot of hassle [tech service, packing/unpacking, returning, etc.] to warrant a very cautionary review of this television. Maybe my best advice is to be certain to buy from a store that makes returns easy. [BTW, I bought online from Crutchfield. They wanted to charge me $100 to ship it back, but I've been able to convince them that the TV is faulty - especially with the proof of my new, good set. Regardless, the logistics of delivery and pick-up have been a real pain in the neck.] ***Pretty harsh title, huh?Well, I wrote it because it's true. I want it to catch your eye and burn into your memory. If I successfully do one thing today, that's what I want to do.I have now owned this TV for 5 days and have hated nearly every moment I have tried to watch it. I have to incessantly play with the picture controls to make it look even the slightest realistic. My best bet has been to turn the color completely down and watch in black and white. In color, most people look as if they just walked in from 2 months in the desert - completely reddened. Greens and yellows are so unrealistic it makes 60 Minutes look like a Tim Burton movie. Contrast changes drastically with different camera angles [auto-Contrast setting turned to \"Off\" too].Sure, I've calibrated, tinted, connection-checked, tried different sources [HDMI Roku, HDMI HD Cable Box, Component Cable Box, simple coax from an older DVD player - all poor], called customer service - you name it. Nothing works. I am sending it back.I did not see this TV in person before buying it, but after a few positive reviews on the 'net and inspection of similar models from other manufacturers, I figured it would be a solid unit.

The glass is like a mirror. If you are anywhere where there are lights you will see the reflection of the room. So I am pretty disappointed by that.  Secondly, the only audio output is an optical one, so now I am going to have to replace the old surround sound receiver in that room with a new one that has an optical input.  Lastly you cannot channel up/down with all channels because it separates them out into different bands. So you cannot surf for example from 2-1 to 3 to 4-1. You have enter the channel number when you go from HDTV to regular or vice versa - dumb!", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "junk", "Author": "george h", "ReviewID": "R4JGNZNPD861I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This TV lasted one hour before the screen went black...what a piece of junk.
