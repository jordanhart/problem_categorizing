{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Bad sound and shipping.", "Author": "Joseph LaDrig", "ReviewID": "R30HW3NHNO3GEU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I emailed within two hours of purchase to say I was going to be gone when you showed  my ship date.  Your response was the vendor didn't pick up the email in a timely fashion.  Then I received an email that said my shipment would be held until I was home.  I was relieved.  Then I received the T.V. that Saturday, two days later in the morning.  A week before I was supposed to get it.  I spotted it on the porch when I came home.  The reason I'm concerned is I lost a package off the porch a few years ago.  After plugging it in I find the sound is very tinny.  After reading some reviews I bought a pair of computer speakers and use that as my sound now.  If I would have knew that the sound was like that I would have not bought that unit.  It pays to stay with a name brand, or something you've had exposure to elsewhere.
