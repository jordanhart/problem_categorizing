Lew", "ReviewID": "RY75AWC4TJYW5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this model at Fry's, and just returned it after giving it a three-week trial.  The picture quality is excellent.  Alas, this was marred by a very noticeable lip-sync (aka lip-flap) problem when viewing HD signals - search Wikipedia for lip-sync for an explanation, but briefly, it is when the speaker's mouth movements trail the audio.  This was my first exposure to HDTV and digital signals, and I assumed Comcast cable was at fault.  When I called to complain, they shrugged off the problem by saying the TV's electrical design is the culprit (something about not enough \"digital-processing horsepower\").  Some HD TVs have a control to impart a delay to the audio to re-sync the signals, and Comcast suggested checking the user maunal to see if it has one (it does not). Whatever the truth is, the out-of-sync performance became increasingly distracting, and was a show-stopper for me.", "Date": "September 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "poor sound", "Author": "Auburn Berry", "ReviewID": "R3BOSPOP3DIKDF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Great picture, but horrible sound.

It has built in settings for like game, movie and sports. Most in this size don't offer that. It also has for its speakers, the settings offers different sound settings. Standard (which is the default) sounds like a tin can. But if you change it, it sounds nice. So I can not recommend the default sound.", "Date": "January 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice TV", "Author": "D. Haddock", "ReviewID": "R3LQY7TDRSSWKI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV has very good picture quality and reasonably good sound quality.  It has a wide angle of vision so the picture stays clear and vivid when you move around the room.  This was a huge concern for me when shopping for a small LCD TV.  The construction appears to be of high quality.  Very happy with this TV and would buy this model again.", "Date": "January 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "the bear", "Author": "Sam Lucius \"scipsi bear\"", "ReviewID": "R1BCZVTPF1FF8M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "has good color very bright even in bright light can be images can be seen quit well", "Date": "May 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great bedroom TV", "Author": "Kenneth Jeong", "ReviewID": "R2C8VVIWECR8F8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV as a gift to my wife on our wedding over 2 yrs ago.

The only issue I have with 19LG30, and it may be on all LG TVs, is that the four tuners do not integrate with eachother.19LG30 has NTSC, ATSC and QAM (plus an broadcast tuner) but they are all given their own seperate folder that will not allow you to integrate them when scrolling through channels. Put more simply, if you press up (on the remote) and are on channel 5 (5-0, standard def.) with the CATV tuner, you cannot go to the HD channel 5-1 (which LG puts in the CADTV tuner folder) you will go to the next in-line standard definition channel, ie. 6. One needs to press 5 again on the remote to go to 5-1 or 5-2 etc. Once in the HD folder or CADTV, pressing up will only scroll through that folder channels. So if you want to go from channel 7.1 (HD channel) to channel 8 (SD channel) you cannot logically and simply press up on the remote: you must press 8, wait for the delay, and the TV then switches to the CATV folder of channels. Bollocks!This \"set-up\" is totally frustrating if you are using this TV without a cable box, which is kind of the idea for a 19\" TV, and typically scroll channels using up and down on a remote.I am not sure if this will be an issue after 17 February however, as there is a seperate folder labeled DTV in the channel menu (which remains empty after auto-tuning). If DTV integrates all the channels (once it is online) than this is a dead isssue and this is a 5 star TV. Otherwise why LG do you have such a poor operating system that can't enable/integrate the different tuners? Samsung and Sony integrate the tuners into one folder/line-up.", "Date": "February 3, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "LCD HDTV features Clear Voice technology which enhances dialogue sound quality with tilt stand and energy Star rated\n720p HD resolution 1440 x 900p with HDMI 1.3 digital inputs\nInvisible speaker system for richer more balanced sound & a polished look\nEnhanced AV mode with three settings Cinema Sports or Game\n5,000:1 Dynamic contrast ratio", "Name": "LG 19LG30 19-Inch 720p LCD HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/3120VzL18CL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0016PCHL8"}}
