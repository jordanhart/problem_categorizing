So far the picture looks great.  My last tv was a 42\" 720p plasma.  This has a noticeably better picture.  The 240hz refresh rate is very noticeable, even on standard definition.  Everything looks very smooth.  I was very excited to try the 3d. It was pretty cool at  first, for the first 20 minutes, but i don't see using it very often. It was fun to flip through all the 3d content and see what everything looked like, but I think i would rather watch most movies in 1080p 2d.  The 3d does look good, but its not as good as the movie theater.  At the movie theater things look like they jump out 20 feet and hit you in the face.  With this, the pop out effect is less than impressive. I would say stuff only pops out 6 inches.  There is a lot of depth though.  The background effect is much better than the pop out.  This is my first experience with home 3d and i would venture a guess that this is a good as any home 3d.  So far i really have nothing to complain about.  If i find something negative, i will edit my reviewforgot one negative is it only has 1 hookup that can be hooked up either composite or component. It has loads of hdmi ports, but for older devices without hdmi, you can only hook up 1", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "I am impressed so far. **IMPORTANT** UPDATED 10/02/12 @ 03:50", "Author": "Brian S. Walcott", "ReviewID": "R2O6ZM3EFNNHXS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this TV on Black Friday at Walmart.  Fantastic picture and the 3D works great. I watched Conan The Barbarian and the newest Pirates of the Caribbean. Conan was the first I watched and to be honest I thought the 3D part of the TV was going to suck. Then I watched Pirates and realized that the 3D worked fine, at the end where Black Beard stuck his skeleton hand out of the water spout showed what this TV's 3d can do. I paused it and the hand really looks as if it is reaching out of the screen. So the 3D quality of the movie you are watching will make a world of difference. The best way to judge 3D TV will be to watch Avatar on 3D blue ray on a 3D blue Ray player. I haven't done that yet but should have a new BR by the end of the year. Avatar is the gold standard for 3D so if this TV can impress me there it will have been well worth the money.  The 240hz refresh rate does give the shows and movies a live look. I watched The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy and realized that the 240hz refresh rate makes all the large battle scenes of Orks and such look pretty real considering the only thing real is the computer code written for the scenes. The sound SUCKS OUT LOUD & it sounds terrible while doing it. I have mine ran through a Surround system so that is easily fixed. The Audio Optical Output feels really lose and audio can be lost if you move the TV from side to side and put the least amount of tension on the line. I would rather it have a separate HDMI output for sound but I think the higher priced models do that. Get your High Speed HDMI cables on Amazon or somewhere else on line. The price at the store for 6ft of High Speed HDMI was no less then $30.00 for the cheapest and over $70.00 for others. I got one for $9.95 on Amazon. Be prepared though: Regular channels (non HD)look terrible and Black and White movies do not show well on this TV. I am a huge old movie fan too :(  As far as regular channels it may just be my cable provider. What they say is HD is not the true 1080P HD one would expect. I have yet to find a HD channel that they have that has 1080P, this TV tells you the signal strength if you press the info button on the remote control. I have not used the Wi-Fi feature & hope I can get it to work when I get it hooked to the internet. On set up I did not have it connected and the TV said if I skipped steps in the initial set up that certain features on the remote will not work. Surely once I connect on-line it will go through those steps again so my Remote will be up to date. If not I will be pretty pissed. I am very happy with my purchase so far but give this 4 stars for the poor audio quality and the loose optical connection..UPDATE:  I would not suggest this TV or ANY 3D TV for families with small children. My 3 1/2yo grand daughter was over last weekend so I ordered Cars 2 3D. We watched it for about 5 minutes until she took the glasses off and said they were \"making her eyes burn.\"Update: Captains Log Earth date February Thirteenth Two Thousand and Twelve: Time 22:44.  I have had several people over and the response I got from them when viewing 3D content on this TV was WOOOOOOOOOW!  Several different people on several different occasions all with the same comment.  WOOOOOOOOOW!  I am such a Star Trek geek. LOL!Update: 002/29/12 00:44. When I wrote this in the original review \"Be prepared  Black and White movies do not show well on this TV.\" I was wrong. After learning the ins & outs and how to use the settings this TV shows the oldies just fine.Update: 06/11/12 00:41. I was babysitting kids this weekend ranging in age from 4 to 12, when I put the Smurfs 3D in and once again the response was WOOOOOOOOOW!! They loved it and were so fascinated by the 3D effects they were not really paying attention to the movie. They had seen it before but not in 3D. I had to tell them to NOT TOUCH THE TV & that it only looked like an open window into another world. I am very happy with this black friday purchase as a matter of fact I think this could be the best buy I have ever made. The response I get from EVERYONE is WOOOOOOOOOW!UPDATE: 09/27/12  02:17.  I got home yesterday morn and tried to turn it on. Nothing happened, it did not even click or flash. Called Vizio tech support & they scheduled a tech to come out. It is suppose to be under warranty I bought it on Black Friday (11/25/11). As long as they either fix it or give me a different one I will be happy. If they don't I will let you know to NEVER buy a Vizio, evidently powering problems are rampant in all Vizio T.V.'s.UPDATE: 10/02/12  03:50. It took 5 days from problem start to problem corrected. Vizio did make good on their warranty and a tech fixed the problem. HOWEVER: (This will change my review to a 3 star). The problem was with a firmware update (specifically lack of one). A firmware update or lack it should not have caused such a catastrophic failure. The unit would not come on at all requiring a tech run. This type of issue should not warrant having to pay someone to come out & do it. I am connected to the internet through a direct link to my modem, I have always been able to use Facebook & hulu but I have never been able to get the updates. I will be checking in with Vizio monthly to see if updates are available so I can get them before the set turns off & a tech is needed again. The picture, 3D and internet apps all look great and still when people see the 3D picture the response is always WOOOOOOW! But a lack of firmware update should have never caused the set to NOT work.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Died after 12 months and 2 weeks", "Author": "Kathryn E.

Been interested in 3d tv for a while but of course the prices were too high, but under 600 for what lists over 900. Couldnt pass it up for an early Christmas present to myself. The quality and picture of the tv is amazing. Bluray play and 3d avchds and blurays look amazing. Great depth. Great Clarity, brightness, and contrast. Only issue I had for a couple of days was getting my Xbox 360/PC to work in 3D. The option for 3D would not even present itself. Its grayed out, yet the tv tuner as a source lets you switch to 3d even when the source video is in 480i 2d. Well I spoke with online chat support but that didn't help much at all. The rep just said the source video feed had to be in 3D for the tv to allow 3D mode. But it doesn't...But after trial and error and lots and lots of online searching I discovered that the issue is, for whatever reason the tv will not accept 3d from the 360 in 1080p mode. Even using hdmi 1.4 cables. But once you change it to 1080i or 720p (on the xbox) it works fine. Also on the PC your graphics card has to have HD output set up, apparently just having HD resolution doesn't work  (setting to)1920 x 1080, it has to be in set to HD 1080p mode. (just make sure in the right corner of the screen when you hit info on the remote it says 1080i HD or 1080p HD not 1920 x 1080 (for Pc's) Now regardless of whats playing, the tv allows selection of HD.

I exchanged a 37\" Vizio 1080p with 60hz refresh rate for this one.Picture: Blu rays are so much smoother on this TV because of the high refresh even though both TV's have 1080p. How smooth the motion the movies is takes a little getting used to because it is easily noticeable after having a TV with lower specs. The smoothing motion effect can be turned down and off in the \"advanced picture\" settings.Gaming: I Played \"Gran Tourismo 5\" in 3D and I loved it. No the image doesn't pop out so much but it appears to go in quit a bit, But seeing the cockpit of the car in 3D was pretty awesome. There is a game mode pre-programmed in the tv settings. The game mode should be turned on especially if you play \"Call of Duty\" the response time will lag and your movement will feel stiff. I think game made turns down the refresh rate. Make sure to turn game mode off to watch a blu ray for a crystal clear picture.Internet:I was pretty impressed that the tv is equiped with wireless n capabilities. So far I have used it to connect with the facebook app that is pre installed. It has a simple and easy to use interface. I haven't used hulu or netflix yet. It also has an amazon prime video on demand app.Ergonomics: Very nice looking TV and super thin. It has a swivel stand so the TV can pivot to the left or right. I dont care much for the slide out key board on the remote becuase it seems flimsy. The keys are really soft so I have to press them in pretty hard to get a response. I dont like the hdmi cables location, they are on the side and point to the left and are plugged rather than at the bottom and pointing down. This puts strain on the cables. I have noticed that most led tvs are like that. I have dish network and wasn't to sync the DVR with the TV because I couldn't find the name in the TV's data bank. I could just be missing something that I dont know. This does not effect any capabilities of the DVR satellite TV.Sound: I don't have Surround sound right now but the speakers are definitely loud enough. I thought I could hear some distortion when I first turned the TV on but it was either my imagination or it went away.Overall I would recommend this tv to anyone is great quality and I don't regret buying it. I searched for several hours for a tv that could match this one spec for spec and this price could not be beat. even amazon doesn't come close. I would have rather bought this tv from amazon and had my TV come to me than to spend the time in line on black friday at walmarUpdate: After using the remote a little more it's starting to grow on me and doesn't feel so flimsy after all but it I still need to press the buttons in firmly to get a response. After figuring out how to sync my DVR I also found that the Vizio remote can also be used to control the DVR functions. Also, I powered on my PS# and the TV turned on by itself, wont turn of though.

Obviously, if you are used to a hearing everything in surround sound from your $2000 home theater system, the speakers on the back aren't going to do much for you by themselves. But for a person like me, who has never had that luxury, the speakers are great. They get sufficiently loud, however, one may consider turning off the sound equalizer in the settings while watching movies with loud and soft sequences as it has a hard time adjusting.Second, the picture is great. The 240hz refresh rate makes a difference even on basic  television (yes there are people out there who don't have cable or satellite), but it is nothing to rave about unless you would be running a blu ray player through the television. It is up to your preference, if you like the refresh rate lower and not as fluid, it can be adjusted to a lower refresh rate.This television is highly customizable to your tastes and is a great purchase for anyone looking around for a mid-level HDTV.Critical Points:There is a constant high pitched tone that emits from the back of the television when it is on. In most situations this will be drowned out by sound from the speakers or background noise, but it was just something I noticed. You definitely won't notice it unless you are actively listening for it.Wireless network recognition is a little weak. I realize this varies a lot between devices as my laptop gets a fine signal in the room where the television is, but the television barely can get a bar. You may want to invest in a wireless router that repeats the signal to boost it enough to take advantage of the apps.The internet apps are a little hard to navigate. But honestly, if you find it easier to access apps through your blu ray or other device, just don't use it. However if it is your only option, the apps work fine although there is not much to choose from.The remote is a little unnecessary. It flips out into a keyboard and it seems like that feature was almost an after thought based on the stability of how it is made. The keyboard buttons are a little small and it is difficult to type anything longer than a couple sentences.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Vizio M3D420SR - Terrific HDTV", "Author": "Sam", "ReviewID": "R1VQ7K57AHKEIL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for a 42 inch HDTV from Samsung or Sony.

It has all the new features I am aware of. But the real pleasure is the razor-sharp clarity. And at $598, it is an amazing deal for a 42 inch TV!!!One con is that the Wi-Fi isn't strong enough.

Samsung with the same specs cost almost 3x more for what this tv cost on Black Friday of $598 making this tv the price for price best.

Simkins \"Just a customer\"", "ReviewID": "R19NKWPAQBWR9E", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I actually have the 46\" version of this TV, (M3D460SR) but that model didn't show up in my search here and I wanted to rate this product now that I've had it for over 2 years.  Everything works as it did when it was new.  Though I still haven't tried the 3D that I thought would be used a lot more by now, everything else works the same as when I bought it.  I get a lot of comments from friends who come over to watch football games.  They say the image is better than what their HDTV displays.  That has been due to their TV's being 1-3 years older - newer technology in this one.  My biggest and most aggravating complaint about this TV is how slow it is to display after being powered on.  It's excruciatingly slow!  I sometimes think it's getting slower but that may just be my shortening patience with this thing.  I usually hit the power button then go to the bathroom or something while it slowly comes alive.  Last year I bought an LG 32\" HDTV for my bedroom.  That thing is almost \"instant on\" which only furthers my aggravation with my Vizio TV.  The unit came with 4 - 3D glasses and I just bought a 3D Blu-ray player (finally) due to my original BD player (Samsung) WiFi card failing.  3D was never a criteria for me buying this TV or the subsequent BD player, it was other features and cost that drove my decision.  I have not had any problems with the Vizio not displaying, or sound not working.  The WiFi feature was a major factor in my purchase, but in hindsight that was completely unnecessary.  The TV can't seem to handle HD video being streamed from the internet very well.  I suspect insufficient memory (RAM) is the issue but don't know for sure.  The movies would \"stall\" often, take far too long to load, or just stop playing altogether.  But when I used my BD player to stream HD video, no problem at all.  It was like watching a disc.  So it wasn't my internet connection either.  The remote included with the Vizio is pretty well organized I think, and I love the slide-out keyboard.  That helps a lot when having to enter characters, whether to set up your WiFi connection, or search the internet for content.  Still, I already am certain I won't buy another Vizio when this unit dies.  I just can't take the slow start up anymore.  And it really aggravates me that they mislead me to believe this is a 240Hz refresh rate display.  It is NOT.  That 240 number is \"SPS\" meaning, Vizio came up with a way to fool you into thinking you're getting something you're not.  Basically, it displays the same image frame twice rather than displaying one frame for 1/2 the time.  So it is no faster of a display than any other 120Hz unit on the market.  Some marketing exec at Vizio just came up with a lie to tell us and pull one over on their customers.  Other Mfr's do this as well so watch out.  Samsung is one of them.  If they have to lie to sell their product to you, that can say a lot about the product and how the company will treat you when you have an issue with the product..", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "great tv.", "Author": "Aisea", "ReviewID": "R2X91E08XDZLJ5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "before i bought this tv it took me 2mo of research on 3D tv's and i'm glad i did my home work. i watched a lot of TEKHD on youtube, and read alot reviews on the tv. plus the 240hz is what also sold me on this tv.", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "To get a better tv you must spend at least another $400.00", "Author": "Bosnun", "ReviewID": "R1DLGT3DXOKCAE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a tech geek, and a TV snob.

The picture is fantastic, Vizio apps were a nice added touch, the internet hooked right up . . . and then I hooked my HDMI cable box up to it.Any HDMI cables broadcasting a signal to the TV create a high frequency squealing noise. If you're over 35-40 or don't have sensitive hearing and don't mind just turning the volume up a couple clicks its no big deal. For me at 28, it's maddening.I called Vizio and they were very prompt in having a repair technician come out to the house. They sent him out with a new main board, power board, and bluetooth module for my TV, as well as his own blu-ray and HDMI cables to test it. He tested and confirmed hearing the issue, much louder now that the case of the TV was off. He replaced the parts one by one, testing each time to see if it helped the problem and each time the problem was identical. After this Vizio escalated my issues and said they were sending me out a new TV. This is where things got ugly.The shipping company was so inconsiderate and incompetent that taking a half day off work wasn't enough, they completely missed their 4 hour delivery window by more than 2 hours and had to make me take a second half day to deliver the TV. When the TV finally arrived it was a refurbished unit with paint chipped off the stand mounting brackets and clear signs of wear and tear, I guess a new case was just too much money for Vizio to spend on a replacement unit for a TV that had left their factory less than 11 weeks ago. Icing on the cake, exact same identical issue as verified by their repair technician weeks prior.I refused delivery and called Vizio back. I got snotty service from their Utah CSR and the call center supervisor. It took threatening small claims to recoup a days lost wages and the full cost of the TV to get the issue escalated to their corporate office. When I got a call from Irvine the next day the CSR read the same script with the same 'I don't care' attitude and was more concerned with regurgitating the same 3 sentence replacement policy rather than using their head and getting someone involved who could help. I've since gone to a few retailers and verified that floor models of the TV are making the same high frequency squeal, audible as far away as 15-20 feet to my ears.I come from an engineering background, and told them on the phone from the start (as did their on site technician) that its a design issue with the electrical on the main board. Here I am two months later and countless hours wasted on the phone all trying to help a company out. It's so bloated and incompetent that each person I talked to refuses to even acknowledge there could be a problem with the TV design or involve someone that can speak to it.Two months ago I was excited about a US based electronics company and wanted to help them fix an issue and avoid a larger recall or worse - as with the Samsung LNT line - a massive class action lawsuit that would cost them millions. Instead, I'm now taking my TV back to the retailer for a full refund and there's no chance I'll ever own a Vizio product for the rest of my life.  All of the models size variations have the same issue whether 42, 46 or 55\".

As people catch on they will stop buying this brand.I purchase a lot of products from Amazon and frequently use the product reviews to judge what to buy or not buy.  This post is to give you some additional information.  It is too late for me, but I am shopping for another brand right now... not Vizio.", "Date": "August 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value for the price!", "Author": "Gavin R. West \"dustgavin\"", "ReviewID": "R203HMQUL769NW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this television a year ago during the holidays and I am completely pleased with the quality! The picture is razor sharp (once the settings are adjusted properly), the stock sound is decent, and the build quality is top notch. The passive 3D quality is comparable to most theaters and you can save those glasses for home use as well! Another great feature is the ability to play media through any thumb drive. Just make sure not to plug it in while the television is on or you will be in for a loud, ear-piercing surprise!As with any major purchase, do some research before you invest your money.

It was a pretty cool TV with the YouTube app finally showing up a few months later.  The startup time was always a bit slow at around 30 seconds or so.Yesterday it was a pretty good TV, today a POS paperweight because it won't turn on.  Vizio \"support\" wasn't very supportive, they had me try the reset option and no dice, still dead. Then they gave me a number for a general TV repair place.  No discount on repairs, just a \"gee that's too bad\" from their customer support.  The vizio logo lights but it won't turn on (button on TV or remote).  I really thought this thing was going to last more than 13 months.13 months and it's out of warranty and dead, dead, dead.  Two days before Christmas.  Merry F_ing Christmas from Vizio.UPDATE 9-2013 Got another TV while waiting to get the POS vizio fixed.  It sure doesn't take 20 seconds to turn on like the crappy vizio mistake.  Got the vizio fixed, but now the software won't update, and the HDMI ports won't work correctly, it can't handle changing between HD and standard definition, so the cable box won't work and half the time it says \"Not Support\" for anything connected via HDMI.  Not \"no support\" or \"not supported\" but \"Not support\". Even the error messages are annoyingly bad on this POS TV!Software won't update, don't feel like getting it fixed AGAIN, so most apps (like netflix) are not working any more. What a POS.IF you want to feel like a sucker and be reminded you've made a mistake every time you turn on the TV (and wait 20 plus seconds), buy a Vizio.", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worst TV I've ever owned", "Author": "Douglas A.

The TV malfunctions ALL the time. The apps lock up, and you have to restart the tv constantly. I contacted Vizio several times and they were never able to solve this. I also had problems with the remote after about 6 months, but they sent me a new one. Now, one week out of warranty (tv is 1 year old) and the tv is completely dead. We have it in a bedroom and it gets used a couple of times a day, but for some reason it's dead. The customer service response is that if it doesn't turn on, then it needs service. They won't tell you what's wrong with it, just call one of their partner companies and pay them a boatload of money and they'll get your tv back to its original crappy state. I've heard that Vizio uses really cheap components and my guess is that's what the problem is. I own tvs by Toshiba, Samsung, and Sony and have zero problems with any of them. This is the newest tv and now its a $900 paperweight.

I purchased the tv with a 3 year warranty and went home, wall mounted it, then plugged it in and went to turn it on...Nothing. No screen activity at all. D.O.A.!!!!!The Vizio light on the front lit up, and I could see the optical light on in the back, but that's it. Walmart could ONLY offer me my money back, no exchange..Why?..Who knows?.So I used the manufactures warranty; they say at home swap out in 7-10 business days.I couldn't be more upset considering I sold my other tv to afford this Vizio, and I am involved in what could be a HUGE problem with my 3 year warranty: Walmart management has already told me that they will not honor the 3 year warranty on the new replacement tv I get because it will have a new serial number.Walmart suggested I urge Vizio to take over the warranty due to circumstances.I'm pulling my hair out here. No tv and lots of headaches. My only choice is to rant on this site and call Vizio again tomorrow with my claim # and tell them what Walmart says about the whole extended warranty thing.
