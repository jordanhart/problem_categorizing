Would still buy it at the current price.The TV itself is a great value, ALL METAL construction, everything is cast aluminum and glass.  Just the back panel is plastic! Picture is great, though only 420p, and perfect for a bedroom. Only complaint is that my Tivo remote does not work on it, so there are two remotes in my bedroom. So that said, if you are on the fence about this TV, I like it and it is a good buy compared to a lot others.", "Date": "November 20, 2006"}, {"Title": "Do Not Purchase", "Author": "stanleyadams", "ReviewID": "R3BGU9L9T91EUR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Without a doubt, this was by far the worst and most disappointing product I've ever had the displeasure of wasting money on. It looks nice and shiny butthe quality of this product is subpar. Like glitter on a turd. The TV is hard to turn on and turn off, the inputs are difficult to reach, the monitor makes noises when it isn't supposed to and that's if you can get this thing to work at all. In effect, all this thing is good for is a paper weight. How did this product ever get to market is beyond me. I would not be surprised if this company went bankrupt. I can't find support services anywhere, and they have no website so I guess that means I'm right. I had to learn the hard way. Next time, I'll invest in a monitor/tv from brand that has been around for awhile instead of these cheap knockoffs.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "One star - One year", "Author": "R.

Very disappointed, because until it died I thought it was a nice unit.

It does not take up a lot of space and is very convenient in my small home. The stereos deliver wonderful sounds. The only small problem is that the images are blurry sometimes, especially when you are near the screen. Color contrast works well.
