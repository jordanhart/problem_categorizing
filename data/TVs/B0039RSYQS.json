{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great picture + networking = total winner", "Author": "Uluru II", "ReviewID": "R1ZBHJDUQWFRQ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first HDTV, so keep that in mind - I was bound to be wowed by HD, no matter what the TV.  But I really like this one.  It has excellent specs (high contrast ratio, 2.7ms response time, 120 Hz) and a 'picture wizard' that seemed to do a great job in calibrating the picture settings.  It supports the latest HDMI specs, and has some nice features like Real Cinema (which maintains film's 24 frames per second when watching a movie with a compatible source), and also the ability to tweak the settings of TruMotion, LG's image interpolation system.Interpolation is what 'smooths out' video on HDTVs - it actually creates additional frames on the fly to fit between the existing frames of the source, and it's what can give HD material that documentary/soap opera quality.  Sometimes that's desirable, but other times it just looks bad and cheesy.  This TV has Low, High, and User settings for this feature.  I was able to tweak the User setting to a good compromise, that smooths out some of the blur and 'judder' effect of normal video, but doesn't make it look artificial.  There are lots of other settings to tweak, for audio (downmix preferences, dynamic range, etc.) and everything else.  This brings up the user interface.  The menu system on the TV is very user friendly, and graphically attractive.  The remote control is one of the best I've used - it has just enough buttons, while being well-laid out and thin and light, and fits nicely in the hand.  The 'arrow pad' to move left/right etc. has comfortable buttons and works well (remotes often screw that section up, for some reason, but not this one).My favorite feature has to be the networking/Internet capability of this TV.  When I bought this TV (at a store) it came with a free Wi-Fi USB stick, so it was a good deal, but be aware that on its own the wi-fi stick is an unreasonable $70-80, and you can't just use any old USB adapter, it has to be a special LG one - at least it seems to work very well and it's N or G capable.  Or, you can also use the TV's wired ethernet port - even a 50' ethernet cable would be cheaper than the wi-fi stick.  In either case I think it's well worth the cost to unlock the TV's networking capability.  (***EDIT: I have recently seen the LG wi-fi sticks being sold at stores and on Amazon for around $35-45***) Built into the TV are the streaming Netflix interface, VuDu, YouTube access, and more, including Yahoo Widgets - this lets you access your Yahoo account and any associated widgets, like Twitter, weather info, stock feeds, whatever.  I only really use Netflix and VuDu in this section, but it allowed me to eliminate my Roku box and remote.  When you already have a computer or laptop in the room, the Yahoo Widgets thing seems a little superfluous - this TV is NOT a replacement for a computer with internet by any means, but for some people, being able to quickly check the local weather or movie showings, etc. on the TV could be valuable.The best part about the networking feature is that it will let you stream media from any computer on the network.  You just need to install some included Nero software - which, by the way, is actually small, un-bloated and simple, unlike any other Nero product - and voila, your PC is a media server.  You designate a folder (or however many you want) to be your media folder, you put videos, music or photos in it, and you can access them on the TV.  It really works well and it's very easy to do, literally just a few clicks of the remote.  I found that even streaming a 1080p mkv file wirelessly from my PC worked fine and looked fantastic.  There are a few caveats - for one, it only supports mp3 for music (why not FLAC, or iTunes format?).  It supports a lot of video formats (mkv/mp4,avi, divx, and more), but not all of them, and even for supported formats it may be finicky with specific files.  Usually, converting the file to another format will solve the issue and make it playable; this is annoying but it's only happened a few times out of dozens of videos, for me.  Occasionally, fast-forwarding or reversing through a video streamed from your PC can be confusing and slow (you backtrack 15 seconds, hit play, and it plays about 2 seconds before where you started).  This and the other issue could have everything to do with improper video encoding, and nothing to do with the TV, I don't know.  But given that the TV will automatically update its firmware through the network, one might expect these bugs to be gradually worked out.  Hopefully, they will even add support for more file formats with future updates; it's just a matter of adding more codecs to the firmware, which seems like it should be easy to achieve.The styling of the TV is subtle and not cheap-looking, unlike some brands (*cough*Vizio*cough*).  It's just a clean piano-black border around the picture, with a tasteful LED 'bar' light that stylishly fades from red to blue to indicate power.  The stand is easy to assemble (just install some screws) and looks nice while supporting the TV adequately.  The screen has a matte surface, so glare, while not totally eliminated, is not an issue.  The typical buttons (power, channel, input) are on the right side, out of sight when viewing from the front.  This TV has plenty of inputs - 4 HDMI, two component, two old A/V (the red, white and yellow kind), and normal cable input.  It also has an optical audio output, which will let you consolidate all sources into one stream.  This is great, because I no longer have to switch my AV Receiver between sources - cable, Blu Ray, VHS and Wii all go through the same input on my receiver.There's only one feature I really miss - the ability to control my receiver volume from the TV remote.  My old tube TV remote could do this, so why not this new juggernaut?  Like all flat TVs, the built-in speakers on this one are adequate but not much more.  You'll definitely want a home theater setup, or at least a simple receiver with a pair of speakers, to do the big, beautiful picture justice in the sound department.  (BTW, Blu Ray looks stunning on this TV!)I'm really quite delighted with the LG 42LD550.  It's one of the few major products/appliances I've owned that met and exceeded my expectations, and I have to dig pretty deeply to criticize it.  Even these criticisms are happily brushed aside, given how much I like everything else.  My only regret is not splurging on the 46-inch version. :)", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Enjoying TV, nice picture, great features.", "Author": "Ferk V", "ReviewID": "R3DSG2ZJI750R3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "TV is great for the type (LCD) and price.  The picture is bright, good contrast, and very smooth.  The menu/remote are very comfortable...overall the picture is very nice.  Aesthetically, the TV looks great as well...no cheesy features or decorations.  This is my first LG product and I'm very pleased with this set.  Also added the wireless adapter ($70).  The entire setup and interface are very intuitive.  This is a kids TV and they had Netflix down in no time (even the 5 year old).  My only wish would be a backlit remote control.Only complaint at all is with shipping.  It did not ship on time and there was no communication from the shipping company.  Ultimately, I had to contact the shipper to make an appointment (was stated that they would contact me).  Once I called them, they drove it over the next day (Saturday).  All in all, still very pleased.", "Date": "June 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "You are in for a big surprise", "Author": "Frank O.", "ReviewID": "RBX9ZS5FDJ00T", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this TV a few weeks ago after reading many nice reviews about it, and while it's nice, I found its features disappointing.To start with the good part, this TV indeed looks great both on and off: its no-frills design is very elegant and will make it look good in every living room, its picture quality is amazing. I can't really comment on the sound since I don't have good speakers, but I'm not even missing them with the built-in speakers. Its TV-related functionalities and interface is also nice, with zillions of options to set the picture and sound to your liking.However, the selling point of this TV is supposed to be the built-in software for online applications (called Netcast), and Netcast on the 42LD550 is a major letdown. At the time of this review LG doesn't have model-specific information on the Netcast features available, only a generic all-promises page with the fine print \"features vary by model and product category\". Now, Netcast in principle has at least three different video-on-demand services built-in, as well as internet radio, and many other great features -- but this TV has almost none of these included! (I'm using the latest software version, as it updates itself automatically.)Netflix is included (that's the one extra star), and there is a dumbed-down version of Vudu, which only includes the movie rental features, but nothing else. (For example, there is no Pandora, even though it is included in the \"real\" Vudu application, it's only left out of the LG version). The rest are useless \"apps\" and a few selected Yahoo Widgets (all the good ones are missing, the best is probably Weather), Flickr, Picasa, Youtube and Twitter (twitter on a TV??), and that's pretty much it. But there is no Amazon On-demand, no TV On-demand, no internet radios, and I am listing only missing features that are available in some TVs with Netcast or Yahoo Widgets, but are not on this one.Another (minor) quirk is that this \"wireless-ready\" TV requires an extra USB wi-fi adapter (LG AN-WF100) to actually go wireless. This is also made pretty clear in the specifications; the only problem is that it's not easy to find this adapter anywhere! (At the time I bought the TV it was only available from a third-party vendor through Amazon marketplace, and it wasn't cheap.) So if you want wireless, check first if this adapter is available.At the end I'm not sure why would most buyers get this model. If you just want a sleek TV with great picture and sound, then there's no use paying for the internet-related features, and you can get a better or larger TV for much less money. It's perfect if you are considering buying a great TV with no internet features and a Netflix box - it may or may not save you money, but you get everything in one package, saving you the set-up or cable issues. But you may have cheaper options using a Netflix box, or if you already have a video game console, or by connecting your PC to your TV and using some media center software. If you expect all the bells-and-whistles from your internet-connected TV, then you have to get another model, because this one is really just a beautiful TV with a built-in Netflix box.", "Date": "August 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "I think it's love.", "Author": "Ryan Boam", "ReviewID": "R2SNE4G2IPA30C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been planning on buying a new tv for quite a while, and did as much reading and research as time would permit.  I kept coming back to the LG 42LD550.  What really sold me on it was the Netcast (powered by the WiFi USB dongle), super-high contrast ratio, wireless-ready, and the price.  The price!  Man, a tv like this would have cost several thousand dollars a few years ago.At any rate, I've been working this set for about 2 weeks now, and I love it.  The picture quality is amazing, it's very responsive, the remote is very good, and even the speakers are decent.  If you spring for the wireless box, you have the option of mounting it straight on the wall with no unsightly cables hanging off of it (or being routed through the drywall).

Setup is easy, aesthetics are good, picture quality is fantastic, and the menus are intuitive.  I bought the WiFi adapter and it works flawlessly.  Setting up the network connection was very easy (I am not techy at all and it was only a few simple steps).A few specific points to make:The base is wobbly side to side (which is better than being wobbly front to back I suppose).  If you don't have small children running around who may knock the TV, it shouldn't be an issue.  But it makes me nervous everytime I have to move the TV stand or the TV itself.TruMotion: The standard picture rate is only 60 Hertz.  This is the appropriate setting for most regular television shows.  You have this setting as long as the TruMotion setting is \"OFF\" in the picture menu.  If you turn the TruMotion setting \"ON\", whether it is low, medium, high, or custom, regular programs look different.  The refresh rate of the picture is increased and gives the program a look of being rushed.  Some have said it looks \"soap-opera-like.\"  The definition of the picture is not increased at all (still 1080p), but the refresh-rate makes action appear smoother, which distorts the image for regular shows.  To enjoy normal programming, make sure the TruMotion setting is \"OFF.\"That said, if you are watching sporting events, the difference between full TruMotion and no TruMotion is striking.  I always set it to its highest settings when watching sporting events. Because it's live and unstaged, you don't get the same weird feel that you get with regular shows. Edges are crisp, motion is clear, and the overall picture is almost breathtaking.  It makes all the difference in the world.  It means going into the picture menu manually to change back and forth, but it is absolutely worth it.Netflix: The Netflix streaming feature is absolutely worth the price of the Wi-Fi adapter (that is sold separately).  I watch Netflix on the TV almost as much as regular broadcasts.  It is intuitive, clear, convenient, and the picture and sound quality are phenomenal.  Absolutely one of the best features of the TV.I would absolutely recommend this product.  Others may have more \"apps\" or other bells and whistles, but in terms of pure picture quality, intuitiveness, and specific convenient features, you'd be hard pressed to find a better option than this one, especially at this low price.", "Date": "October 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Had received a bum TV at first, then a replacement that works great!", "Author": "Parag", "ReviewID": "R17FGW08GBFDZ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me just say that if you are not getting a good picture on this TV then most probably it has a defective component inside, and you should call Amazon (not LG) customer service to get a replacement. When I got my TV, the picture wasn't so good, and then sometimes, when using Netcast, or connecting my PC, it would start shaking vertically after an hour or so of usage. I tried several adjustments (like turning off Tru motion etc.) but nothing worked.I got a replacement TV soon, and like everyone has already talked about it, it is great!I will just mention about some other things:Amazon Customer Service:=======================I just used the \"call me\" feature, and I got the call the instant I clicked on that button. The customer service agent (probably in India) was very friendly and just asked me what was wrong with the TV etc, and arranged for a replacement right away. Overall, Amazon's customer service for getting a replacement TV went swimmingly.Netcast:==========There seems to be some confusion about what this feature has. Currently, this feature includes1. Yahoo widets - weather, sports, finance etc.2. Netflix - works great, even HD streaming. It can only access your instant queue.3. Vudu - didn't try it, rentals seem expensive.4. Youtube - don't use this much either.5. Picasa - you can watch random public images or even sign in to your picasa account and play slideshows etcThere is no Pandora, Skype etc.Connecting a PC through HDMI:==============================I have my desktop connected to this via HDMI and use the TV sometimes as an extended display. The display is very good. I don't see any pixels etc, e.g., when a PDF file is open - it's good for couch reading. I even use to watch my Windows Media Center stuff, or Skype video through my PC on this TV.Shipping-  PILOT Vs CEVA:==========================My first (bum) TV was shipped by Pilot. There was only one delivery man who struggled to carry the whole box inside. While assembling the TV etc he acted as if he was doing a favor to me. Didn't even have tools for the job. Though, later I found that the carrier is supposed to setup the TV for you, and also power it up to see the menu screen and check for any visible cracks.My replacement TV came via CEVA. And the service was awesome!! and very professional. Two people team lifted the TV and were very careful with its handling. Also, they told me upfront what they will do and what not (for e.g., they will not help you set up your cable connection etc). Overall, I was much impressed by CEVA's service.Both the carriers did call me in advance to let me know of a delivery time, and also an hour before actual delivery.Other features I like:==========================1. I like the \"My Media\" feature. It connects to your PC through the same LAN cable you have installed to use Netcast. You have to install the server software (included) on your PC. You can access your videos, music and pictures stored on your PC right on TV.2. Intellisensor is good. I like its adjustments based on the ambient conditions.3.

I did a specification comparison between several LCD TVs and finally had to decided between LG and Samsung. I choose LG TV as this one has 120HZ with 2.4 ms refresh rate.I am not sure how do these features affect the picture quality but this TV has excellent picture. I mostly watch movies over internet using netcast/DVD player and didn't watch fast sport action yet. Sound quality for this TV is regular and you need to buy speakers if you want something special.The wining feature for this TV was the Netcast functionality. I watch a lot of Netflix streaming over internet and this works great for me. You need to have atlease 3 MbPS connections to watch HD movies. Currently you can only have Yahoo Widgets, Netflix, Vudu, Picasa web album and Youtube available (no web-surfing).I am disappointed that I had to buy a LG wireless adaptor ($ Seventy) to access wifi. You can use a LAN wired connection as default without the adaptor. This TV also has some power save modes which I am using a lot to decrease the brighness when needed or switch off the display when not needed (listening to music). As this is not a heavy TV (around 40 lb), so it is relatively easy to hang this on wall.If Netcast is not what you need then I would recomend to have a look at LG 42LD520 which is a chaper bet than this one.

Hoping for Amazon's customer service support was really the only reason I purchased this through them.  Once the return window closed, I was not able to return to Amazon.  No big deal, just call LG, right?  Yeah, right.  They scheduled me for an in-house appointment.  The day before the local service center called to tell me they knew what was wrong and it would be 3-5 days before the part would arrive.  Know what is wrong without looking at it?  Seriously.  Hmm, okay maybe if Thanksgiving wasn't in a couple of days.  I called LG again, and they said I was pretty much stuck with the local service company and would provide no other solutions or compensation, and that the first customer service rep shouldn't have told me someone would be out on the first available appointment.

Fanton \"Another Music Lover\"", "ReviewID": "R15MP24W42DQ7R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this set from Amazon about a month ago and have been very happy with it.  As you would expect, I spent a lot of time researching HDTVs both online and in stores.  I had initially been looking for a 46\"+ model but after spending some time looking at them in person I determined that a 42\" set would be a better option.  I use the TV primarily for viewing HD cable and gaming on an XBOX 360.  A larger set would have been too big for the room and gaming would have been a headache.Free delivery (through Pilot) went smoothly.  I scheduled my delivery date at checkout, followed the progress on Pilot's website, and called to follow up the day before (they did not, and would not have called me).  Setup only involved affixing the swivel stand which, while not rock solid as other reviewers have noted, is no less stable than other flat screen stands I've seen.  There is an included attachment screw if you wanted to semi-permanently mount it to your entertainment center.Initial setup was easy and I never needed the included users manual CD.  There are a lot of settings options which initially overwhelmed me but I found a great forum with a number of settings and a wealth of other information for this particular model (the AVS forums are great).  I'm happy to post a direct link in the comments if anyone is interested.Image quality, black levels, contrast, viewing angle and even sound are all wonderful.  I have a pioneer surround sound system that I have yet to bother setting up since I haven't had the need yet.  I've only gotten the set cranked up to half way (15 or so maybe) and it was plenty loud.  We usually watch it on 8 or 9.Also, I had considered the 520 model of this same set (as I'm sure others have) but opted for the 550 due to the slight increase in dynamic contrast as well as the internet connectivity.  I have no need for the wireless adapter as the TV sits right next to my router.  The network connection allows for automatic software updates which can add functionality or troubleshoot bugs.One important note is that a recent automatic update changed the Netflix interface, adding many more functions, category browsing, search capability and a new layout (I may try to post some pictures when I get a chance).  While I previously used my 360 to stream Netflix movies, the ease of using the TV alone can not be overstated.  The picture quality is great (obviously depending on your connection) and the controls are intuitive.  I've also fiddled with Youtube a bit and set up some of the Yahoo widgets but Netflix will be the primary use for the Netcast feature.I'm still tweaking some of the settings but the set lets you adjust and save settings for each input.  I've programmed a different picture mode (game vs. cinema) and completely different settings (backlight, contrast, TruMotion, etc.) for the cable and the xbox and all I have to do is change the input and the tv applies the settings I've programmed.  Inputs are initially labeled as \"HDMI1\", \"HDMI2\" etc. but you can select from a number of preset labels and icons (cable box, game system, etc) and assign them to the appropriate input.  It's a simple feature, but a very handy one.  In general, gaming looks great and I've yet to notice even a hint of input lag.Overall, I'd say this TV ranks at or near the top of its price category and gives models costing a few hundred more a run for their money.

They promised me that he would call me back within 24 hours.I eventually gave up waiting, returned the TV and ordered the LG for an additional $78 instead.Nobody from Samsung has ever called me back (it has now been weeks).WHY LG MAY BE A BETTER CHOICEThe LG model has no problems playing my MP4 videos. It plays from my 1 TB hard drive and any USB memory stick (FAT32 or NTFS format).It will even play M4V video which is Apple's file extension for MP4 containers.Here is the best part!Apart from the extra 2 inches (screen size) the LG model offers:1) Netcast, providing direct access to online viewing of Netflix, YouTube, Yahoo weather (and others).2) Free Nero MediaHome 4 CD opening up for Digital Living (DLNA) capability allowing you to access wired or wireless computers or other networked devices throughout your home to the TV.NETCASTUsing the Netcast feature, I no longer have to have my laptop PC connected to the TV to watch NETFLIX and it appears that the picture and sound quality is better than via a connected PC. Also I like to be able to select, start/stop and pause the movies from the LG remote.The TV has the RGB and stereo mini plug for a PC in case you still want to hook one up.I connected the TV to my home network by wire because I like the \"wired\" Ethernet speed and reliability (wireless is also available - see other reviews for details).NETFLIX was very easy to set up. Simply push the Netcast button on the LG remote, click on the Netflix icon. Enter the code displayed on the TV on your PC and you can start watching Netflix movies (obviously you must have a Netflix account or sign up for one). For only $8 per month you can watch unlimited movies without commercials. (I have come to realize that life is too short to spend part of watching TV commercials).DLNA (Digital Living Network Association)Installing Nero on my computers allows the TV to access any drive on my network. From the LG remote I can browse all Music, Video and Family pictures stored anywhere on our home network (Nero requires you to allow access to the specific folders before the TV is allowed access).The LG rep informed me that TVersity software (free) will also work as an alternative to Nero (I have not tried it yet).INITIAL SETUPThe initial setup was equally easy for both brands. The Samsung software/firmware was up to date. It took a short while for the LG to update from version 06.01.05 to 08.02.16 which may be because LG issues updates when new Netcast services comes online.The initial channel lineup was easier to manage on the Samsung.LG CUSTOMER SERVICEThe TV arrived without the Nero CD.I therefore called LG customer service. They told me that they may not be able to ship the missing CD. Instead they suggested I download the trial version from Nero.I therefore contacted Amazon Customer Service and they instructed LG to send me the CD. LG has confirmed that it \"is in the mail\".I am still waiting for the CD (at the time of this writing).I am currently using the Nero trial version which does not support MP4!!!CONCLUSION$78 for all the extra functionality and two extra inches is well worth it.", "Date": "January 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Quality TV", "Author": "E-Cowboy", "ReviewID": "R1RLGILH842L11", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There's not much to criticize with the LG42LD550...

Not knowing very much about LCD's, LED's and Plasma's I started researching on-line for direction. After I narrowed it down to an LCD I researched the various brands.I appreciated the variety of information on the LG 550 .. I didn't want to only go by what was said on the LG site, after all, what else would one expect to read from the manufacturer but glowing reviews.I found a tech site that offered objective reviews on the top brands. It broke everything down giving opinions/reviews on things in particular as well as an overall review. It offered rankings based on numbers sold in a category as well as a rating based on consumer reviews; then I could read the reviews - good and bad.After all was said and done the LG 550 with netcast and internet capabilities grabbed my attention ... and never let go. I found a great price on Amazon.com. I printed out a description of the Television, a picture of it as well as the specifics/stats and gave it to my husband. We both anxiously awaited delivery ... and we have NO REGRETS!I rate highly the excellent customer service of Amazon.com; they make everything easy - from account set-up to keeping their customers informed of the transaction every step of the way to tracking the shipping.Once we had the LG 550 set up we thought what we felt must be what new parents feel upon the arrival of their first child. We think the look of the television is beautiful - sleek, clean lines. It even comes with it's own cleaning cloth. Everything about the television is, thus far, proving to be just as we expected based on what I had read.We haven't used the Netcast feature yet - were are trying to figure out how to get the service. If I have one complaint it is the fact that more information on HOW to establish Netcast service needs to be included with purchase of the television.Other than that, we are pleased with the LG 550 and would highly recommend it.", "Date": "October 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV at a great price!", "Author": "B.

While some reviewers don't really appreciate the Netcast it really is a neat feature.  It really is just a novelty item for the TV.  It does not include Pandora but what it does include works without issue.  The Vudu streaming and Netflix streaming are excellent.  That was my primary focus on getting the Netcast TV.  The Yahoo widgets are neat but nothing special.Video quality is excellent.  It is full 1080p for connected HDMI sources and comes in crystal clear.  The video optimization features are top notch and you can create a mode for any environment you are wanting.  The streaming video exceeded my expectations (especially Vudu).Sound always gets a bad reputation with flat screen TVs in this price range.  I haven't had any issues with it.  The sound is plenty loud and has many options to adjust it to your needs.  I do plan on hooking up a blu-ray home theater in the near future to fully optimize my TV experience.There are connections for anything that you would ever want to hook up.  A nice bonus is that there are 4 HDMI ports.  Switching between inputs is a breeze and anyone will find it easy.Bottom line this is a great TV with a great price for the features it offers.  If you expect more than it is listed to do I would recommend spending more and getting what you want.

Normally I go with Samsung products, but this TV was cheaper and had more features than the nearest Samsung TV.

The picture itself is amazing, and it is honestly one of the best looking LCD TV's I've ever seen.  The contrast is great, and the true motion feature is adjustable to reduce or disable the unfamiliar soap-opera effect (IMO having it on low is the best setting.  It looks a little strange at first, but you get used to it, and it's much better than dealing with judder).  1080p just looks incredible, and animated movies like Bolt look so good, you can't believe you didn't know so much was there that you never saw before.I have it hooked up to my xbox, but the extra features it has are very nice to have in a TV.  It streams movies from my computer, connects to netflix, and more more more.  I only wish it had wireless built in, but I had an ethernet bridge, so it's not a big deal.I really can't say enough good things about this TV, so I'll just put it like this:  If you are looking for a 42in TV or have $750 to spend, don't look around any more, just buy this TV.

I got the wireless adapter as well, and have been using it to watch Netflix and Youtube, which is amazing, and was my main criteria when I bought a TV. The Netflix app started out being pretty bare bones, but has since updated and works much better - you can now search, it gives you recommendations, etc. I showed some people flickr photos once, which was pretty cool. I've also plugged my laptop into it (with a DVI to HDMI cord) to watch things on Hulu and iTunes. It works, it's easy, it all looks great.What sold me on LG rather than other brands, and what I'm ultimately very impressed with, is the design of the menus. I always seem to be changing inputs and settings, and the user interface is very clean, functional, easy to use, and aesthetically pleasing. I wish more electronics manufacturers would pay this much attention to that particular detail.Here's three (very small) cons: 1. The only audio outs are an optical out and a headphone out. My stereo is kind of old, so it has no optical in, and I've been using the headphone out. No big deal, but it would be nice to easily have a permanent hookup. 2. I wish there were more services included as part of Netcast - namely Hulu at the moment. I don't know what LG's plans are to upgrade this, but since a TV like this is a 10 year purchase, I'd be curious to know if there will be any integrated access for services that don't even exist yet. It's not a dealbreaker, since it's easy enough to plug a laptop into the TV, but it's nice not to have to. 3.

There are also some settings that aren't always available (visible, but grayed out in the menu), but no explanation as to why is given in the manual.  But there is a \"Picture Wizard\" tool built in to the TV, which got the picture pretty close to what I wanted, and I was able to get it the rest of the way on my own.Overall, I don't think one can go wrong with this television.

Five stars! However, with that said, I thought I'd detail some of the pros and cons for you. Here is my personal opinion (I hope it helps you in your decision):A.) Though the television is advertised as Wi-Fi, you do need to purchase the LG AN-WF100 Wi-Fi USB Adaptor. Yes, it is an annoying inconvenience and an extra fee, but it is entirely worth the price. (And, yes, I was stunned that it was not included with the tv. That's a little ridiculous since most folks are buying the television for this specific reason.)B.) The Wi-Fi was effortless to set-up (any person can do it regardless of her/his technological prowess!) Likewise, I have NEVER lost the connection. (I have a feeling that some of the complaints here about \"losing connections\" have more to do with those customers' routers and less with the television itself). Moreover, Netflix \"instant play\" looks amazing on the television ... ditto for YouTube. One drawback: not everything at YouTube is available for the television. For example, we watched all of Weeds Season Six on YouTube, but the final episode was conspicuously missing ... though it was available on my laptop. We searched the exact title as listed on my laptop, no dice. We searched the person who uploaded, denied. We have experienced this with a few other YouTube posts. While this is (admittedly) an inconvenience, it is still a great feature. (Mind you, like other reviews, Hulu would have been a fantastic addition.)C.) The TruMotion feature is genuinely bizarre. For me, the effect was uncanny and disorienting. I believe that there may be some value in relation to \"sports\" (maybe hockey) ... but I found the results for gaming and regular viewing to be strange. Certainly, not a big selling point for me (now that I've seen it in action).D.) Aesthetically beautiful. Furthermore, all buttons are \"hidden\" on the side (this is a welcome change from my other LG where the buttons were positioned in the back ... which made mounting difficult).E.) The sound is rich for such small speakers. Nonetheless, audiophiles will definitely want to add their home theater system to it (for some added crispness and depth).F.) The HD is staggeringly sharp. Truly gorgeous. (If you have HD cable, this television will be the perfect addition to your home. It really showcases HD cable!! I was totally impressed!!)G.) Delivery from Amazon was spectacular. Once the television was purchased, I was permitted to select the day and hour of delivery. Not only did the product arrive exactly at this time, but the delivery person carried it to my second floor living room ... and then set it up!! The delivery person was super friendly and extremely fast. (He even set-up the remote control!) This was all included in the price of the television.While there are a few drawbacks, the price and quality are not to be missed.

I've built a dedicated media laptop connected via DVI/HDMI and it has Hulu desktop/Boxee with a wireless keyboard and that adds to any missing capabilities from NetCast apps (only 6 NetCast apps is the negative point on this - they should instead integrate something like Boxee into it).

This is especially useful if you are watching a program with your spouse, they can still watch while you check the weather, stock, etc.This TV has tons of inputs.  It has 4 HDMI which I have found to be most important, but it has all of the other formats as well.  I have an HDMI cable that I can use with my laptop.  I can use it to work or play games on my laptop on my TV while sitting in bed.The wireless function of the TV requires a separately sold USB Wireless plug, which cost about $75.  I opted to purchase cat-5 cable, run it through my wall and place a jack behind the TV so the TV does not have any hanging wires.  It seems that most electronic components (expensive and inexpensive) have wireless inside them except TV's, DVD players and other TV related components.

The Internet apps work well, but I wish they'd gone the extra step and put a web-browser into the product.The USB wireless network adapter is a cinch to get working and Netflix content is quick and smooth.  My only complaint is that the remote control is very touchy... it only works close to the set and when pointed at specific angles.  Everyone who has used it has complained about it.  Otherwise, this is a very nice product.Original post:So, this may be a nice TV.  I wouldn't know as I haven't seen it yet.  I've read others horror stories dealing with Pilot Freight Services, but I've never really had those kinds of experiences.  Maybe I'm lucky.  Well, luck ran out on this one...  According to the shipper's instructions, Pilot was supposed to call when the TV got to the local delivery agent.  We watched the TV make its way from Indianapolis to Fort Myers using the shipping tracker and we expected a call on 12/6 as advertised.  When that call didn't come, we thought, \"Oh well... probably tomorrow.\"  Not then either, although the tracking screen now said that it was in our town and \"out for delivery.\"  Then it didn't show up.A call to Pilot was met by rude and clueless service people who told us that the tracking information on their web site (and Amazon's) was wrong and that the TV was actually sitting in a warehouse in Miami, but that since Miami didn't deliver to our area, they couldn't call us for delivery arrangements.  Instead, they will ship it to Tampa (driving right by our house) where someone will call us to arrange delivery.  We should have it in about a week they said.There is no telling where the thing is now.  The people on the phone didn't inspire confidence and the apparently fictitious tracking information on Pilot and Amazon's web sites are apparently useless.So, if this nice looking TV ever gets here, I'll come back and review it specifically.  Since the purchase includes the service and delivery, I thought I'd better warn those who might be thinking about trying to get this in time for Christmas.

There's nothing I hate more than having buyers remorse! The one thing that makes me nervous is the stand. It screws on just fine, but it has a slight wobble. Nothing major, but just enough for me to mention.The Netcast/Netflix feature is great except it's more versatile on the Wii. On the Wii you can browse categories on Netflix, on the LG I haven't found a way to browse anything except for what's in your queue. You also have to buy the $50 dongle to connect to the Netcast internet feature, unless of course you hook it up via Ethernet connection.I love this TV!", "Date": "September 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "More than I expected for the money -- very pleased so far", "Author": "Michael Wheeler", "ReviewID": "RIMIK6QOOO02W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been very pleasantly surprised with how much I like this TV. My old tube HD TV (Sony 1080i) died and I did some quick research and decided to go with the LG 42LD520. It has a fantastic picture. Our local cable TV network HD broadcasts look fantastic and so does video from my AppleTV (Hard Drive model), NetFlix movies from my ROKU XR (Sorry Apple there was just no reason to get the new generation of your AppleTV when the ROKU also offers Amazon videos), I haven't even watched anything from my Blu-Ray player yet because everything else looked so good I haven't felt the need yet. All devices are connected via HDMI but at first my ROKU XR was connected via component video and that looked wonderful as well. The built-in cable management feature is also a nice touch.It doesn't allow me to create my own labels for the inputs and I have to choose from the presets which mostly don't apply. The only one that applies to the equipment I have connected is the Blu-Ray player. There are no presets for AppleTV, ROKU or any type of Internet streaming so I'm stuck with HDMI 2 and HDMI 3 as descriptions. Yuck. The other main disappointment I have is that there is no way to label the TV channels. I'd like to be able to label them ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, Discovery, etc. but there is no option for labeling channels whatsoever not even any presets.To me those drawbacks are minor annoyances but there is no reason not to have those options available on a TV as nice as this one. So 4 stars for User friendliness but 5 stars on every other aspect of the TV. I know the 550 model would have networking and NetFlix built-in but the ROKU box is tiny and simple and I think much better than what I've heard about the built-in networking in the 550. So if you're trying to decide between the two models then just let me say that I'm actually pleased that I opted for the 520 and put the savings toward the ROKU XR.", "Date": "September 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "High Quality at a Budget Price", "Author": "Spook", "ReviewID": "R2UGOU9UTQMI41", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great buy you won't regret it, it's high looks and performance at a price that won't leave you cheated.

Especially if you already have a netflix account this is a must. Needless to say I ordered the wifi adapter for ease of use (FYI this has to be the LG specific adapter ~$50). The displays and user menus are very useful and easy to use. I turn off the tru-motion during movies because 120Hz just doesn't look right to me but for sports my boyfriend loves it. I recommend turning off the video noise filters as they tend to just make things jittery for me (that goes for any TV) but that's your call. Also, the auto dimmer is a great feature so the brightness is adjusted to fit the room and surrounding light. Some people may choose to manually adjust brightness (or energy efficiency as described by the TV). Also, the ability to turn off the screen is awesome for me because I tend to listen to XM or other music off directTV.

You don't write a review after having the TV for only a week.This being my first review of any product, has to mean \"I'm impressed\" and I am.The image quality is great. The audio as I wear hearing aids. It might not sound as some audiophiles would want. It more then sounds good to me, with or without the hearing aids.  I was asked by a neighbor \"where are the speakers?\" He couldn't believe the sound quality not being hooked up to my stereo system. The sound quality is more then adequate. Anyone not likening the quality of sound is asking too much for a TV. If you want audio a 5.1 or 7.1 sound you have to purchase a sound system. Enough said about sound.The image quality is second to none. I've had LCD & LED TV\u00a1\u00a6s yes the LED is not as wide in diameter. And image quality is good. You are not going to get better image quality then this TV no matter the price. I don\u00a1\u00a6t care how much you spend. My son paid almost $2000 for his LCD TV (a Sony) my daughter and son-in-law paid over $3000 for there 55\u00a1\u00a6 LCD and my picture quality is as good or better.

GET THE BIGGEST SIZE YOU AN AFFORD\u00a1K and when you have that wait a little longer save a little more and get a bigger size. Don\u00a1\u00a6t let anyone tell you size doesn\u00a1\u00a6t matter.

(You can check this out in a store)There are more connections then you\u00a1\u00a6ll ever need.How about this! If you are hooked up to the internet you have access to; Netflix, CinemaNow, MLB.TV, Picasa, Vudu, Yahoo, Youtube and one more to come. I didn\u00a1\u00a6t see this mentioned, only NetFlix.. NetFlix has about 3500 HD movies. CinemaNow has thousands. (Cost more then NetFlix) MLB.TV all the games, I hope the NFL will be available.Get this model but get the biggest you can afford!I could mention more positives, but this is enough.For the price you pay for this LG Model LD 550 you're just not going to beat it.

I, along with many friends, notice that most regular LCD TVs(including this one) have a much better look than the high contrasting LED TVs. The picture wizard is absolutely AMAZING! The apps are fun, but pretty much pointless if you have a gaming console. I use this TV for gaming and for a screen to play movies from my laptop, and it does both of these with ease.

This TV is 120Hz; this is said to be the highest possible refresh rate the human eye can notice.

As someone who knows very little about electronics and technical specs, I wanted to get the best quality for my money without paying for a lot of extras I will never use.  I also didn't want to spend a lot of money for something I only use occasionally.  I did want something up-to-date, with streaming capabilities as that's my primary source of entertainment.This TV has suited those needs perfectly.  It was delivered exactly within the scheduled delivery window and brought inside to my second floor apartment.  The deliveryman did tell me that they are generally required to take the TV out of the box and turn it on to demonstrate that it works but that he couldn't because it was so cold outside that the tv had to warm up for an hour or two before I could plug it in.  I was a little nervous to hear that but he left, I waited several hours, then took out the TV and plugged it in.  Worked perfectly, and I managed to set up the whole thing by myself in about an hour, including screwing in the base, connecting cable, DVD player, Netflix.  I am NOT someone who is good at that sort of thing, but I am impatient and wanted to try it out right away and it really was very easy.  The manual is clear and straightforward and I had no problem finding what I needed to know.I did buy the separate wi-fi adapter for about $39 and it was very easy to plug in and get connected to my wireless network.  I mostly watch Netflix movies etc, though it would have been very nice to also be able to access Hulu Plus without buying additional electronics in the future.  This is probably the only negative for me overall.As someone who is not electronically savvy, I actually had no idea how big this screen was going to be.  I thought my old TV (a Sony non-flatscreen) was about 30\" and that I'd just be going a bit bigger.  My significant other kept telling me that it had to be at least 42\", anything smaller would be REALLY small.  Well, I might've known better! When I saw the size of the box, my jaw dropped a little.  I'm not a huge TV person and I live in a cozy Boston apartment, so a reasonable-sized TV is perfect.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by this screen size and have since been very pleased with it.  I would NEVER have chosen this size if I had a better sense of how big it would actually be, but it's totally worth the price and I'm very happy with it. If you have a lot of space or a really large family room etc, perhaps this TV would be on the small side but if you are only sitting 10-20 feet away from it, the picture is great.So if you're like me and don't really know TVs, get a tape measure and pull it out to 42\" and hold it on a diagonal.  Really.  Maybe even add 2-3 inches to take the edges into account.Appearance. I do like the look of it.  This LG wasn't at the top of my list in terms of aesthetics alone and I'm very picky about decorating, especially when it comes to such a large object.  However, it's fairly unobtrusive and looks... well, like a simple black TV.  This is fine with me.  I do have it on the stand but hope to hang it on the wall at some point and will update accordingly.Finally, we did move about a month ago, and it was a MASSIVE move.  I simply wrapped a blanket around the tv (after removing the base) and transported it in the back of an SUV.  I'm sure it sustained a few bumps here and there but it looks and works like new, not a scratch anywhere (which is far more than I can say for some other furniture).  Could I have been a LOT more careful?  Yes, especially since I still had the box, but it seemed more efficient to fill it with other stuff and just carry the TV.  But the TV held up beautifully and I think it's about as durable as a flat screen TV is going to get.Very very happy with this purchase.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price", "Author": "Darrick Addison", "ReviewID": "RMJMC9R139DIZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My family has owned this HDTV for almost 6 months and we love it.

It is my first HDTV and I had my doubts at first, but I have decided it's a keeper.  The price was a selling point with it coming with the internet apps.  I had problems at first trying to get the best picture but read another reviewer who suggested going to the internet and google for picture settings and I found some that seemed to make a difference.  But I was still unhappy with the quality when watching my DirecTV.  I called LG and they told me that sometimes when you watch SD channels with a HDTV the picture may be worse that when watching them on my old tube TV, and they were.  I called and tried to get DirecTV to cut me a deal with upgrading to HD which they wouldn't do so I switched to DISH network and I couldn't believe the difference now watching the HD channels.  I also purchased the LG 590 blu-ray player, which also comes with internet options.  When I purchased them I wondered about having them both have the internet apps, but when I checked into just getting an HDTV without the internet apps, I wouldn't save that much money, so I decided to go ahead with the HDTV.  Also, with the player it didn't seem to save much and I liked the idea of the 250 gb HDD so I have both with internet apps.  At first I used the player to stream Netflix and YouTube, but I decided to go ahead and purchase the Wi-fi adapter for the TV since it was on sale for half the price and now I use the TV for streaming instead of the player, it's just easier.  It is so cool to watch Youtube on the big screen as well as streaming Netflix!  The adapter worked perfectly finding my router and setup was a breeze.I don't have it mounted on a wall, it's setting on my TV stand, but it seems pretty stable and I like that the stand swivels.  The sound seems good as it says it has four speakers instead of two, which was another selling point, and I hope to hook it up to a theater sound system next.I was not happy with the time it took to receive the TV, I had to wait almost two weeks since I live in a small town a long way from a major city I guess.  When I ordered the TV it stated it would be delivered the next week, but when the service contacted me they stated it would be another week and they only come to town once a week and only in the morning, so I had to plan on taking the day off from work since I had to be there.  I lucked out and they called the night before and wanted to deliver it then, so I didn't end up having to take the day off after all, which was nice.All in all, I am very happy with it and would only wish maybe I would have gone larger with a 46 inch.", "Date": "April 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Crisp Picture and flawless so far", "Author": "Andy H.

I found the best price here at amazon and the lowest price on the extended warranty and a huge price difference in the adapter.  Not only did I get a great tv and an excellent deal, the tv arrived one week early!  What more could you ask?  My only problem was figuring out how to change the remote from characters to numbers to input the security key so my network would connect.  My manual and the cd manual did not address this issue that I could find.  I finally noticed on the remote the char/nbr hidden between two input buttons midway on the remote.  Once I found that, the network was fine.  I did have a bit of a problem updating.  The tv wanted to stop at 55percent completion.  I finally turned tv off and went to bed. This morning, I turned on the tv and it did that one more time.  I again turned off the tv and turned it back on and it finished the updating.  I did see when I googled this others were saying they did the same thing to finish initial update.  I was amazed at the pic and sound quality and we don't even have hi-def receiver yet.  I don't know why a lot of raters have issues with the sound unless they are used to big speakers and surround sound.  The internet apps are impressive.  Far more of them then I thought or had read this tv had.  I was very pleased to see ebay and youtube.  Now if they add facebook I will have all the various apps I really need.  I setup netflix for movies and this will allow me to greatly reduce my satellite bill.  I find signing in and inputting passwords a bit annoying as the down arrow and widgets keys are so close on the remote I often hit widgets in error making me start the signin process over.  My husband was happy to see the Gunsmoke channel on youtube.

Second, the functionality which I was very excited about, but have yet to find is the ability to stream personal videos/movies over my home network. Sure I can tie into netflix and vudu and even picasa, all of which are very cool. However I want to be able to create a place on my network where I can dump files, and then access them from my TV. As of yet I have not figured out how to do that. While this might not be important to your viewing experience, it was something I was after and as a result this TV get's a 4 until I figure out a way to make that happen.Overall though, I have zero complaints about the unit itself.

I researched extensively and finally settled on this one (Samsung LN40C630 came in second place).  I picked this up for $699 from a third-party seller that was fulfilled by Amazon and have had it for a little over two weeks.  This was during Black Friday mind you, and I couldn't find any better deal for a name brand 42\" 120 Hz anywhere really.  The picture quality is crisp and vibrant, there is no lag on the screen, the audio is better than expected, the interface is pretty slick, and it's light and aesthetically pleasing.  Major upgrade from my previous 37\" Olevia.  The swiveling base is also key.CEVA delivered the TV; they simply carried it to my living room, but didn't set it up.  It wasn't that big of a deal to me, though, as it's pretty straightforward to take it out of the box and set up the stand and screw the TV on it.  Installation was quite easy to do on my own.On the negative side, I'll say that the remote is not so great.  I supposed it gets the job done and has all the necessary features, but it is huge and looks like a novelty toy in my opinion.  It doesn't matter to me after the onset though because I simply use a TiVo remote, which was easy to setup, so I'm not going to penalize the TV.The interface of the menu for the LG is straightforward and easy to use - it's quite easy to configure the TV to your liking.  I have found that I like turning on TruMotion only for sports (have it on 5-user) while turning TruMotion off for everything else.  Some may like the \"soap opera\" effect, but it does make it seem like things were shot on a handheld camera and doesn't seem very professional/movie-like.  For sports, though, it's great because it makes it seem like you're there.In regards to the other settings, google \"LG 47LH90 picture settings\" and a cnet forum provides the optimal ones they found for a similar LG set.  I found these to be fairly close to what I thought was best as too, but everybody has their own personal taste.The Netcast functionality is decent, but not outstanding.  I haven't used it very much and actually use Netflix through the Tivo instead, but I've dabbled around a little bit watching Youtube videos and the like.  I'd say there is still work to be done with the netcast amenities, but it has a few nice basic functions.  While that is supposedly the selling point for this TV, it wasn't a main factor in my decision.  My main deciding factors were picture quality, price, durability, aesthetics, and overall design, and I'd say it excels in those areas.

It's design is also great.  It looks great with my black TV desk.Complaint is, that there is no keyboard on my remote.

Hufford \"dhufford\"", "ReviewID": "R18Y5TN0ZWTMYN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After much research in this price range, I decided to go ahead and purchase the 42LD550.I haven't had the TV for long at the time of review, but I can say so far the experience has been amazing.  Not a single defect in the panel, no overly noticeable backlight bleeding on my screen, and overall excellent color and quality out of the box.For watching movies I keep the Trumotion settings on low.  It's the perfect balance that helps reduce motion blur, while at the same time avoiding the \"too fast\" soap opera look.I can't attest too much to the internet features, as the PS3 does basically everything that Netcast supposedly does.  I didn't see the merit in buying the wireless adapter if the PS3 could already serve all of the functions that I wanted (and then some, e.g. Hulu Plus).The reason I bought this model over the 42LD520 is because of the higher contrast ratio (150k:1 vs 100k:1), not because of the internet features.  It's nice to know though that if I ever need any of those features they are there.I don't have a cable/satellite subscription, so I can't say how it performs as far as antennas or interaction with cable boxes, but I don't have any reason to believe it would perform any differently.  I've become a Netflix+Hulu user because I can't stand to pay the amount for cable/satellite when I can get everything I need elsewhere (not a sports watcher).  Internet content comes in at a lower quality (even in 1080p) because of compression, so unfortunately I don't get the very best out of the TV all of the time, but I still enjoy Blu-ray in full quality.As with any flat panel, the speakers leave something to be desired, but I plan on getting a home theater system in the coming weeks, so that will soon be an issue of the past.The only weakness in this whole buying process was the shipping, but both Amazon and the carrier (Pilot) were able to work everything out with me.  If you're buying this during the holiday season and you have the option of doing scheduled delivery, I would recommend giving a few days of buffer from when it actually says the delivery will be available.  I expected the TV to arrive in a certain time-frame, so I worked from home that morning, and then no one ever showed up.  Upon calling Pilot I was told that they hadn't received the package from Amazon yet.  Well, that would have been okay if someone had let me know ahead of time.

They informed me that my warranty finished, and I need to take it to some shop. They have no software update available.

While using the remote control, to enter text or digits, use the \"FAV\" key to switch between the two modes. The \"FAV\" key is just below the 3X4 number pad.I used NETFLIX to stream movies. With a 6MB download capability of my DSL, it was very smooth. I did also logon to Picasa, yahoo, and Twitter. However, I noticed buffering on a few Youtube videos, but some were good without buffering.I had problem with Youtube search after update to version 8 of the software. I spoke to LG afew times, and got it rectified with Software version 8.00.11, on Nov 12. So I am returning to giving 5 star ***** rating.Pros: NETFLIX, YOUTUBE, User Interface, Picture qualityCons: The navigation keys in the remote are below the body level in the remote, and needs a bit of extra effort to use.

Here is my list of pro's and con's:Pros:*Great picture quality*Easy set-up*Lots of available ports*This tv actually has games on it, such as sudoku and whack-a-mole.Cons:*Wireless dongle sold separately (was $75 at Best Buy). The dongle is made by LG specifically for these televisions. A regular wireless adapter from your computer will not do the job.*Remote control buttons could have been arranged better. For example: The \"input\" button is at the very top of the remote, while the directional pad is way down at the bottom. It's quite a reach for your thumb. Also, the \"flashback\" button, instead of going directly to the last channel visited, just brings up a list of all recently visited channels, through which you must thumb through, every single time. It kind of defeats the purpose of the button.*The Net-Cast feature. It's why I bought the tv, actually-- so that I wouldn't have to go though my game console to access Netflix and YouTube. But in this department, the LG does not deliver. It gives you seven wireless channels to choose from: Netflix, CinemaNow, MLB.tv, Picasa, Vudu, Yahoo!, and YouTube. No Hulu, no Pandora, no Google. Sounds bearable, right? Half the time, it cannot even connect to the internet, even though everything else in my apartment can. And for some reason, browsing YouTube on my tv brings back only a fraction of the search results as when browsing on a computer. The videos that *are* able to play are blotchy and pixellated, and not clear at all.*Because of my location (and I don't live in the woods), shipping was a big hassle. Way to go, amazon.Bottom line:If you're looking for a basic tv, consider this one. If you're looking for a well-made wireless-ready tv, buy a different brand.

I shipped it back because this LG tv is not good with motion. If you love videogames, movies and entertainment then this tv wont satisfy you. sometimes things look really good when there not moving fast and toy 3 looked awesome but once things get going, the blur was bothering me.The biggest thing that made me mad was the fact that I upgraded from a 32 inch Jvc old school crt tv. Now this old tv did not have any motion problems, I never complained about that tv, it's only problem was that it was old and heavy but it was a great tv. So going from 480I to 1080P that looked great but going from my Crt motion to this Lg motion was a mess. I don't like the true motion feature, it makes people look soap opera like and i don't want that affect on my movie unless the movie was made to look like that. Now if your a fan of that real type of look then you might be happy with this tv. It just didn't work for me. I hooked it up through hdmi, I used it for blu-ray and xbox 360 and it was just average.If the motion was smooth without the added soap opera effect then I would of been happy but it just didn't cut it. So I'm probably going to get a plasma nevause there motion is the best and the burn-in problems aren't too bad these days..plus I'll get a warranty so I'm not worried.
