{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Ben", "ReviewID": "R127KD55OCYD6T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Seeing that this is a relatively new product, with no prior reviews, and the first to offer wireless image technology, I was a bit hesitant at first.  However, with the great specs and competitive price, I decided to go for this model.  I couldn't be happier.I am not a tech wizard by any means, but I know quality when I see it.  And this has it all.  The image is superb!!  Hi-Def cable & Blu-Ray discs look fantastic.  Let me emphasize that there is absolutely NO image degradation whatsoever due to the wireless capability.  I would suggest keeping the \"media box\" (which transmits the wireless audio/video to the screen) outside or on top of any cabinet, and placed as close as possible to the screen.  Even though I originally placed my media box on the second shelf of my cabinet, with only a glass shelf above it, I still experienced a loss of signal strength, which was pretty much unnoticeable aside from a few flickers every now and then.  I moved the box to the top of the cabinet, and I now have very good to excellent signal strength (LG recommends keeping the signal strength at very good to excellent (four to five bars).This product seems too good to be true (again, for those not willing to hire an electrician to cut holes in the wall and rewire your electrical and components through your walls), but I couldn't be happier.In terms of appearance, it looks great, with a semi-tranparent plastic frame around the screen.Item was shipped via Pilot, and they were courteous and professional, and even helped to open the package to ensure there was not damage (since one end of the box seemed a bit crushed).I just set up this TV two days ago, so I will come back and make updates to this review as needed.", "Date": "December 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Just what I needed", "Author": "DK \"DK\"", "ReviewID": "R3D7WQCEFG9SUB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was set up with minimal problems. I am using an outdoor antenna (rotating) and have connected the set to two DVD players, a Sony blue-ray and a Toshiba that plays DVDs from all countries. The LG is a bit selective with regard to input and since I have two TVs and needed to send the signals to either, I found that only the Octava switch boxes were capable of doing this. The LG input did not get along well with other HDMI switch boxes.  Aside from that problem (which few others will have), this set worked perfectly, and its could get a good signal even from an indoor antenna. The only potential problem is that there appears to be a short lag between the audio and video if one uses a separate amplifier and speakers from the DVD. There is an optical audio output on the transmission box that may prevent this but I have not tested it.", "Date": "January 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Happy with the purchase", "Author": "RCali \"RCali\"", "ReviewID": "R1CYL0XDYGUVQL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this T.V. back in February for $999, which continues to be a steal.  I'm pretty happy.  Not sure I really needed the wireless technology with my current set-up.  Had some issues with picture issues due to the fact that I have placed the wireless box under in the tv in a open cabinet.  Might try moving it out or just directly connecting the wirless box to the tv. I still see a few trails during live action so moving to 240 hz might be a good idea for those who watch a lot of live sports.  At the time I bought the t.v. the 240hz were just too expensive.  If I bought a new one today I would ditch the wireless and spend the money on the extra Hz.", "Date": "July 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "OMG I Scored a Great Tv!", "Author": "K. Nasseri \"Man Bear Pig\"", "ReviewID": "R35LKI6JEUUXOY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow. where to start....So HD Digital cable is unbelievably sharp. Especially sports. Especially the Nuggets.There is something to be said about movies or tv shows recorded before HD, like Senfield or a movie like Transformenrs. There is this thing about it at first you can't get away from and its tough to explain. Its the 120Hz True motion tecnology that basicly \"up-converts\" dvd quality picture to try to get closer to HD quality by rounding, filling in, artificially rendering more frames, hence 120hz, opposed to telivisions 60hz. The manufacturer sets this on high, so it is quite noticable at first. After changing the setting in Advanced Controls It actually has a nice impact, and as long as I can change between Low, high, off, I'm Happy.The wireless runs smooth as silk but you need direct, non-obstruction, between box and front base of tv. The box is good. Nice amount of imputs of all kinds. compoters, old vcrs, whatever. currently mine is at a distance of 4 ft. but will be moving to 20ft.I mounted it on the wall, with an ultra thin 1\" wall mount. I had a small problem because the cord coming out the back was like 1.4 inches and i had to balance the otherside with something. But it is secure and looks great.The tv is an Energystar tv, so it has like 5 different power levels you can run. It also has this light sensor that can sense the ambient light in the room and ajust the brightness of the screen. So when its bright in the room the tv automatically adjusts brighter, and same whae it is dark, it dims to fit the suropundings.The stand is nice.The apperance of the tv itself is really beautiful. As you know it has a translicent outer boarder. Its kinda mocha-y chocolate hue. The liquid drop is sweet. it is off when the tv is off. it is red and moving when you turn it on, and a light white when tv is on. You can turn it off.Price, I found this at 1289$ with shipping, 1/5/10 I would not pay more. I was enitially looking for a 700$ tv but didnt have the level of quality, and dont for get the wireless!So I got just the powercord sticking out from the tv making it more flexable in room design.Thats about all I think needs ranting about.enjoy.", "Date": "February 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Horrible", "Author": "S.

Great wireless picture, but it must have a clear shot from box to screen!  I wanted a clean install above a fireplace. I have cinderblock walls with firring strips and wood panelling so running hdmi cable from a dvd player, roku and a wii was a BIG dollar propect.  The wireless feature solved all my problems.  One issue; the edges of the tv taper to a thin point.  They look good but don't provide any place to put the wii sensor bar, so you have to get some brackets or a shelf to put the sensor on.", "Date": "January 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Happy customer, with a few caveats", "Author": "Hap E. Shopper", "ReviewID": "R1GU3FYCNJSEM9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had my LG 47LH85 for six months, and I'm thrilled with the picture quality. Friends have commented how much sharper and clearer is my picture than their more expensive set.  Set up was easy, too.While I like the wireless feature, you should know that the set, of course, has an electrical cord in the middle of the back. It's wireless in the sense that the HDMI cord attaches to a separate media box.  Other reviews will tell you there may be connection issues if the media box isn't in close contact, but my media box sits on top of my TV cabinet and connects beautifully.When the set arrived, I was experiencing a sound lag; that is, the sound was about a second delayed from the picture.  It was completely annoying and unacceptable.  Upon calling LG's customer service, they soon sent a technician to update the software. I've had no problem since, and I would hope they've corrected this issue.I bought the set thinking I'd hang my TV on the wall above the TV cabinet, and in the end decided to stand it on the cabinet.  Therefore, there's no need for the wireless media center.  I still use it, however, because it offers extra connections for a game system and a DVR/cable box.  If I had to do it over, I might purchase a different unit without media center. The wireless media center delays start-up by 10-20 seconds, which is not a big deal.The other issue I have is a desire to attach external speakers to enhance the sound quality.  I don't see any way to add external speakers.Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase and with the quality of this set.", "Date": "December 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Picture", "Author": "E. Sun", "ReviewID": "R19JR18J57WZ9V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV as a Black Friday deal for $599. The picture quality is amazing compared to my 1080P 60\" 600hz Plasma I have in the living room. The sound quality is just ok in my book. The wireless receiver is a neat idea but I already had all of the wires ran through the wall so it really didnt do me any good. I am having some issues with the reception of the wireless but I think if I move the box it would fix the problem. I would highly recommend this TV to anyone.
