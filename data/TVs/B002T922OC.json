{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent TV, but beware of the early runs.", "Author": "Aaron H. Prather", "ReviewID": "R2KZ2EOAKVDD4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The dirty little secret when buying consumer electronics is to not buy them when they first come out, because there are bound to be bugs and defects among the first units manufactured. The manufacture is bound to discover these problems, make the necessary correction(s), and the subsequent lots should not have the same issues. This Vizio model is no exception.I too have had the audio problem, where the audio distorts after a set amount of time. When I went to exchange it, I made sure the replacement was from a different lot than the first, that way I am bound to get a unit that shouldn't have the same problems as what I had before. My new unit works perfectly. For reference my first unit was made on 11/09 and my new unit was made 02/10.Vizio has also made several firmware updates between the two sets I tried out. The first TV had version 2.06 and the second 2.13. I have no idea what improvements were made, but it could relate to the audio problem.What I like about this TV is that since it has a glass panel, the image resembles what a HD CRT would produce. It really smooths out the picture and gives a better image quality that a matte finished LCD panel can't deliver. A typical LCD TV can produce a sharp picture, but at the same time it looks a little hazy to me. You certainly can't get a glossy panel for a TV of that size anywhere that I know of. If you like the look that a CRT TV or a plasma gives you will probably like this TV. I am also surprised that Vizio was able to deliver a LED TV at this price point.I also really like the styling of this TV. It has the appearance of a high-end TV, something like what Bang & Olafson would produce. An the fancy touch panel controls are a nice touch. I would like to purchase a 27\" or 32\" of this same style of set, but unfortunately Vizio only makes this style in in 19\" & 23\".The sound, if you get a properly working unit, is quite good. It looks to me Vizio put a smaller version of their HD sound bar into this set, because the SRS Surround technology really expands the sound coming from the TV. I didn't find the sound to be \"tinny\" at all. As others had reported the sound quickly goes from silent to loud.The remote control only has one IR emitter on it, so if you are fairly close to the TV you need to point it toward the IR receiver to work properly. If you stand back a few feet, then you should have less problems. You best bet is to use a universal remote control (like the one provided by your satellite of cable provider), because many of them have at least 2 IR emitters giving you a wider range for transmission.This TV also features a light sensor that can automatically adjust the picture in relation to the light in the room. Be aware you can't use this feature at the same time as the 20,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio feature. For me the dynamic contrast ratio feature works better for me.For some reason Vizio doesn't advertise the fact that you have the ability to pause live TV (like a DVR), if you plug in a flash drive on the back of the TV. This TV also can play a play a slide-show of pictures on a flash drive.For those that already own this TV and are unhappy with it, I would encourage you to exchange it at the store of purchase or have Vizio replace it. No one should have to live with the defect(s) if Vizio corrected it in later runs.**UPDATE: I have seen that several other retail outlets are no longer carry this product, it appears it is being replaced by a more conventional design, that lacks the glossy screen. If you are interested in this product, be sure to get it as soon as soon as possible.**UPDATE 2: Vizio as released a firmware update for this product (version 2.23), if you are having problems with this prodcut, be sure to download it. It may correct your issue.", "Date": "March 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Vizio vs. Sony vs. Samsung", "Author": "Mike In Mass.", "ReviewID": "RTVOMQS8DV7H5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Although I am not a videophile or audiophile I'd like to comment on this product.To be honest, I purchased at the Cost** Warehouse store because of a $50 savings over Amazon, a 90 day no-questions-asked return policy and an extra year of manufacturer warranty included in the price.  Since this is a new technology in this size set and sales usually come up on TV's around the Superbowl, it made sense to me to have the option of return if the price drops and to be protected by an additional year of warranty.So far, I'm glad I have a 90 day return option because I just might have to take advantage of it regardless of any price movement.  Unless there is something wrong with the set or we can't figure out what we are doing, the poor quality of the sound might necessitate it's return.Having prior experience with a 19\" Sony and a couple of 26\" Samsung LCD sets I can report that the sound on this set is extremely poor compared to the others.  So far, no matter what we do to adjust the sound it just does not perform.  Using the SRS surround setting is just horrible.  This set replaced an older Sony 720p LCD that had a simulated surround setting and it sounded fine.  The other options you have include several pre-sets that do not allow for equalization adjustments if you choose them or the setting called 'flat' which does allow for setting the bass and treble.  So as of this writing the best sound we can get from this set is to use the 'flat' setting and then turn the bass up to 100% and the treble at 60%.  Using this setting the TV still sounds very 'tinny', like you are listening to a 2\" speaker!  If you turn down the treble any more it begins to sound muddy, and if you compensate by reducing the bass you get more tinny.Aside from the sound (which may prove to be a deal breaker), the picture looks very good, on a par with my other Samsung sets.  I think the size is very nice, the old Sony was 19\" and this makes a nice difference giving you more screen area than the 20 or 22 inch alternatives.  The form factor is very sleek, the remote is poor (but we use a combo cable remote anyway).  We do not connect directly to cable so I can't comment on 'channel lag' as has been reported but can tell you it takes an annoyingly long time to start up, making you watch a 'vizio' splash screen, then a blue screen, then finally your picture.If you have a very bright room, be aware that there is the potential for a lot of glare from the reflective glass surface of this set and that may be a deal breaker for you because there is a lot of reflection from some angles.  If you can train yourself to look through it you might be fine.So in summary, we are happy with the picture and performance of the set overall, but if we can't find a solution to the sound problem the set just may go back.  I will update this review if there is any news to report.UPDATE June 21, 2010:It's been about 5 months since we hooked up a set of speakers Altec Lansing BXR1221 2.1 Speaker System (Black)to this set and the sound problems are mostly gone.  I say mostly because once in a while the sound is garbled and we need to shut off the TV and turn it back on again for the problem to clear.  Changing channels or inputs does not work, it must be powered down.The only other issue is the fact that the remote must be pointed at the sweet spot and at the right angle otherwise it does not respond.So if you can live with the fact that you might need a set of speakers to overcome the sound problems and the slight aggravation of the remote responsiveness then go for it because the picture and form factor of the set are outstanding.", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Truly great TV....  I take it back", "Author": "Sacto Fred \"FredB\"", "ReviewID": "RJVVRIR48IJIT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Well with all the problems with the audio on this TV I bought a set of computer speakers.  The sound was fine through these speakers but after one year of use of the third TV I am now starting to have the garbled sound issue again.  Sometimes it just has a buzz to it like I was listening through cracked speakers, (which they are not), but it occasionally gets an echo with the sound repeating itself with about a .1 second delay.  Again I must turn the TV off and back on again to solve the problem.  I see Vizio is no longer making this model so this review is probably mute, but if you get a chance to buy one new, used, or refurbished.... DON'T.I originally gave this TV a Five star rating because of the picture but since then I have had to reconsider.The sound is terrible and would occasionally get gargled or go out completely.  I would have to turn it off and back on the get the sound back to its terrible norm.  I returned it to Vizio for replacement and the replacement was just as bad.I decided to live with it and hooked up a boom box through the headset jack, (It has no analogue audio out), and the sound was OK but the garbling and loss problem still existed.After about eight months the sound went out completely so I called to get it repaired or replaced under warrantee.  I will not write a book on the problems I had with Vizio warrantee service but rest assured it was a real pain.  After better than three weeks I finally got a replacement.  It was not my repaired one so I expect it is a refurbished one because the clear wrap was not on the screen and other parts.I am using it now and the sound is still terrible!  So far it appears the garbling and loss problems are gone, but time will only tell.Whatever the case this TV has a great picture once you adjust the settings, but the sound is the worst I have ever heard.  I have a 19\" Sanyo that has much better sound and the picture was great right out of the box.If I had it to do over I would have bought the Samsung XL-2370-1 23-Inch Widescreen LED LCD Monitor but it was not out until after I bought this one.  It is about the same price and it couldn't be worse if it tried!My original review follows:I bought this TV because my 20\" LG that I use in my home office was going out.  I figured that if I was going to buy a new TV I might as well get the latest technology.  I picked this one because of Vizio's reputation.  When I hooked it up I was truly amazed at the picture quality.  I own 4 HDTVs  and have replace all of them at least once, so I have owned at different times 1 projection LCD, 1 Plasma, and 6 CCFL backlight LCD TVs.  The picture on this TV is truly great.  The standard definition channels look almost as good as the HD channels did on any other HD TV I have owned and the high definition looks so real one would think they were looking out a window.  I remember how impressed I was with my first HD TV, well this TV made an equal impression on me over my prior HD TVs.The only annoyance is the fact that the volume bar does not go away when the sound is muted.  I remains until you un-mute the TV.  This annoys me, but is livable considering everything else.The biggest advantages to LED LCD over CCFL LCD are the power consumption, the expected life of the backlight, and the picture quality.  This TV is advertised as only drawing 30W but my UPS tells me it only draws 26W.  The weakest link to a CCFL LCD TV is the backlight.  It is what goes first most of the time, but LEDs last virtually forever so I will have to see what the next weakest link will be that will cause me to have to replace this TV.  I expect this TV to last for at least five years before needing replacement, but time will only tell.", "Date": "December 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great in Kuwait, except sound defect", "Author": "Allan S. Jackman", "ReviewID": "R2WID97HW113ZV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "****ANOTHER UPDATE****I contacted Amazon about replacing the TV, but since it's been over 30 days since I purchased it, I now have to contact Vizio directly.  It sucks that I'm in Kuwait and do not have access to get this replaced, by the time I get out of here, I wonder if I'll just have to lose the money on this TV.  Definitely keeps me from buying a Vizio again.  Stay with the big guys, Samsung, Sony, etc.****UPDATE****I too have experienced the sound flaw in this TV.  I only use it with the PS3 and have noticed that after about 1 hour of watching, the sound gets extremely distorted.  I'd have to turn the TV off and back on in order for it to reset itself.  I wonder if I can return this from Kuwait as I am not happy with having a TV without sound.  This was supposed to go in the garage/gym when I get back home.I purchased this TV through one of Amazon's vendor (Target), since Amazon would not ship to an APO address.  The package arrived quickly and contained in another box.  There were zero damages to the either of the boxes.After assembling the stand and adjusting the settings, I connected the PS3 and played Assassins Creed 2...WOW!  The picture is amazing, which makes gameplay much more enjoyable.  I have read that many people complain about the lack of sound.  I have a small room to myself, and I keep this about 30% volume, which provides plenty of sound.  Maybe those that complain about the lack of sound are trying to make a 23\" TV their main living room TV, which is not recommended.  My room is about 10' x 20' and I sit about 4' away.This TV also accommodates dual volts, 110v & 220v, which is needed in foreign countries.The only downsize to this TV is that it does not have a dual TV format.  The US uses NTSC cable format while the rest of the world uses PAL.  This TV is set up for NTSC, thus I cannot watch cable TV in Kuwait.  But I knew this prior to my purchase.Yes the remote is small, but I don't care.  It works and allows me to access all functions for the TV.As stated above, for a bedroom, this TV will be nice in the US, providing excellent picture quality and plenty of sound.", "Date": "February 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV!", "Author": "Fabian Franco", "ReviewID": "R1YX43P6YNUZQ2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV because my previous monitor went to monitor heaven after 2 years of abuse. But this TV is absolutely AMAZING! It's amazingly thin, it has GREAT picture quality, the glare is a bit of an issue but I've noticed that you have to enable the \"auto brightness adjusting\" feature and it will automatically comensate for the extra lighting by increasing the brightness, another flaw that I've noticed is that, sence I'm using this as my computer monitor, that whenever I get close to the bottom left corner the menu pops up, so everytime I try to press esc on my keyboard the menu pops up and I have to wait till it goes away to see my start menu. The SRS HD Surround is on by default, if you're only doing stereo it sounds like crap untill you disable it, also the SRS TruVolume is DISABLED by default, this should be enabled because it does make it sound alot better, and it removes that \"tinny\" sound. The remote does have a very narrow window and has to be pointed almost directly at the sensor for it to pick up. And I have not experienced the \"long\" start up times with the Vizio splash screen. Overall I would rate this TV very highly, it's a great buy great for small rooms and the edge to edge glass is a very nice asthetic feature, this TV is BEAUTIFUL and the display is BEAUTIFUL as well... I hope this encourages you to buy this!

Just about everything with this tv disappointed.By far the worse thing about this tv is how reflective it is. I have never owned or seen a TV this reflective. If you are gonna be using this tv in an area with any lights around, find something else. Anytime something dark is on the screen, you can't see anything but reflection. It is really awful.Next was the remote and the delay when doing anything with it. Again, the worse I've ever experienced with a tv. turning channels and going through the tv menus was slow and sluggish.Speakers are awful and require turning off and on the tv. This happened about every hour, the speakers would sound like they are blown. Yet turning the tv off then back on would fix the problem.... for about an hour. They are way to loud, I was using a ps3 to watch bluray, and I had to turn the sound at 6/100. I thought maybe these problems where just an unlucky defective tv, but after searching the internet about it this problem is quite common.Last but not least, the picture. Was it decent, yes. Was it LED 1080p good, no. My vizio 26 inch looks much better. I was expecting the picture to be one of the best I've ever seen on a small tv. It isn't. Colors don't really pop, the black & whites were pretty good though.Overall I can't recommend this tv to anyone. Horrible reflection and speakers. and picture is solid, but I've seen better at TV's this small. I've taken this tv back and ordered me a Samsung SyncMaster P2370HD.

Linn", "ReviewID": "R2NSIQTU98PJ6F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have to be honest. I would not have purchased a Vizio TV if I felt I had another option.  It's not that I've had bad experiences with Vizio; they just have always struck me as a step above a generic store brand.  But if you're looking for a 1080P TV in this size your options are very limited.After returning a Samsung, the only other 1080P option that fit my requirements was the Vizio VM230VXT.  I decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did.  The razor-thin design of this set is very attractive -- far more so than suggested by the images.  It is the first thing people notice when they walk into the room.  The front of the TV is all glass which not only looks good but is far more durable and easy to clean than acrylic.  It is somewhat reflective but the only time I notice this is when the set is turned off.The viewing angle on this Vizio is fully adjustable up and down -- something than cannot be said for the Samsung I returned. The 1080P sets in this size range tend to use an LCD technology that provides a somewhat limited viewing angle as compared to larger LCD HDTV's making adjustability a big deal.  For me, this was a critical feature because the TV is set up in a workout room where I'll be up on a machine, then down on the floor.When I first turned the TV on, the signal happened to be SD material upconverted to HD.  It looked horrible.  \"I have made a terrible mistake,\" I said to myself.  Then I switched over to true HD content.  Wow.  The colors were vibrant w/o being unrealistic.  The black levels were great.  The 1080P resolution was stunning.  Bottom line:  great picture quality; far better than I had expected. (I am a video editor so I know what good HD should look like.)Since picture quality and adjustable viewing angle were my top priorities, I am sold on this set.  But that is not to say it is without weaknesses.  The remote has to be pointed at precisely the correct spot to work.  This has taken some getting used to.  And the audio quality is about the same as other sets of this size: poor.  I was also surprised to find that I was not able to listen to an analog audio-only device hooked up to the TV's legacy AV inputs.  It wouldn't play.  For whatever reason, the TV won't output audio from the analog inputs unless there is a video signal accompanying it.I did not try this set as a computer monitor.The bottom line is that this set has completely changed my perception of Vizio as a company.  It's not perfect but, for the money, it is an excellent choice in a size category with very few 1080P alternatives.  I definitely recommend it.", "Date": "February 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Super Attractive TV, Lacks Quality Control", "Author": "S. Figgins \"sfiggins\"", "ReviewID": "R262N1B6YDSODW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is one of the sexiest, most attractive TVs in this size that I have seen.  It is super sexy thin, and has the appearance of a work of art.  Compared to this TV, all others in the size range are bloated CFL back-lit, inefficient, heat generating monsters that lack any attractiveness.  This one is a design you would expect from Samsung or Sony at twice the price.The problems, however, are the lack of consistency in their production, and quality control process.  Many after reading many reviews, and experiencing the TV itself, I can say that the problems are all over the place.  Some people report problems with the sound quality.  Some people report problems with the volume.  The TV that I received was plenty loud, and the quality was just fine, however the volume is at comfortable level at about a 6 out of 100.  This means to me that the volume lacks adjustment between silent and comfortable, and has too much of adjustment between 6 and 100.  It is very loud at 100.The other problem I have, and the one that caused me to ask for an exchange, is the onscreen display for the proximity sensor-activated controls at the bottom of the screen keeps popping up for no reason, and then going away.  This repeats on and off without any apparent trigger.  It is clear that this is caused by a sensor that is over sensitive, and is sensing something that is not visible to the human eye.  It may be dust, or light, or a reflection, or something else.  I have not been able to determine the trigger.A couple features are lacking that would have been nice.  The video aspect ratio setting is a bit strange,Normal mode will expand 4:3 aspect video to fill the 16:9 screenStretch mode will display 4:3 aspect video at 4:3, and fill as much as the vertical area as possibleOriginal mode will display SD (480i) content in the center at the original resolution, resulting in a tiny picture at the center of the screen, about seven inches diagonal.It should have a \"zoom\" mode that would expand SD \"letterbox\" content st that it fills the screen, however that is missing.  My Mitsubishi DLP has the feature, and it is nice when watching SD channels.Having an on-screen guide, or at least be able to determine if a channel exists would be nice.  If you try to tune to a channel by number that is not active, the tuner will return you to your current channel without changing the channel.  Try to tune to another channel, and your input is appended to the previous input.  The TV should tune to the channel regardless of whether it was added automatically or not.A setting that could turn off the proximity sensor would be nice.  Since this can be used as a computer monitor, being able to turn it off would save accidentally activating the sensor.Hopefully my second one will not have the over sensitive sensor, and will have no other flaws.The picture quality is quite good, and the features that the TV actually has are pretty good as well.  Vizio could address most of the complaints with a firmware update, although tighter manufacturing tolerances and an effective quality control process would also catch the defects.", "Date": "March 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "I bought 2 for my office, one failed in less than 3 months", "Author": "Alan in Texas", "ReviewID": "R2D0BE4LMSSYX3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "One HDMI port doesn't work at all.

This is perfect for a bedroom, exercise room, kitchen etc...I use this in the bedroom and am approx. 10-12 feet away...I have no issues with the sound being \"tinny.\" I think it sounds absolutely fine..Another quick note on the sound..I read a review on amazon where the writer said his sound was faulty and to make sure you get the TV from the lot produced February 2010, instead of the one he received which was manufactured November 2009...That was the first thing I checked when I took the vizio out of the box, and to my disappointment my manufactured date was 11/09..I was worried, but like I said before, I have absolutely no issues whatsoever...So in my opinion, that reader just had a bad product..All these electronics are massed produced, there is going to be a few bad seeds..I am using Verizon Fios service with this TV and the HD pictures are seemless...They should not even have regular channels anymore..HD is the way to go and the picture looks outstanding on this television..Hung the TV and hooked up the set top box and watched the Cavaliers game on it last night and it was as crisp as hell...Just a quick note for anyone interested if they have Verizon Fios..When setting up your remote provided by verizon to control the vizio functions, the code is 1292..This will allow you to control Power, volume up and down, and mute. I'm using the HDMI cable provided to me from verizon as well..Picture is outstanding..The capacitive touch buttons on the TV are cool..Capacitive buttons are basically buttons that sense your touch instead of having a traditional physical hard push button..The power button on the tv stays lit up on the bottom left corner, you simply run your finger over the light and the tv turns on...Same goes for all menu options on the tv as well..This basically gives the tv an extremely clean and polished look..The TV has 2 HDMI ports on the back which is nice..HDMI cable is nice because audio is transferred through this cable as well as the HD picture of course, eliminating an extra set of audio cables...There is only the power cable and HDMI cable running from the back of the TV...I used the the level mount ($20.00) recommended from amazon to hang the television and was happy with it...I fit the 23 inch vizio perfect without having to use any modifying pieces supplied with the mount...In conclusion, 2 days after starting this TV up I am extremely happy with the picture quality, sound is absolutely fine, and overall feel and design of the tv is great....And most important the price!!!

They're too sensitive and as a result the pop-up menu pops up all on its own, whenever it wants to do so. Sometimes it's twice an hour, sometimes 50 times an hour. It gets very distracting.I've been in touch with Vizio support and they had a few suggestions:1. Remove all heat sources from the room. (Sorry, but my house is heated)2. No neon signs in the room.

(It wasn't, but my Roku box was)The bottom line is that the touch controls are too sensitive (probably to RF) to function in the real world and are not ready for prime time.

I was attracted to the edge to edge glass and the whole design of the TV, which looked sleek and aesthetically pleasing.  I find the reflective glass TV screens actually look better than the non-reflective coating they put on most TVs.  Overall the TV had a very beautiful design.The picture was very good as well.  I found some calibrations online which really improved the picture from the out-of-box settings.  The screen was reflective during the day but at night or in a dark room, the screen was amazing.  Color was great, picture was crisp and sharp.  SD content was decent, HD (via PS3 Blu-ray) was great, and games looked nice as well.  Finally, I didn't have any problems with the Menu.  It popped up whenever I got about 1-2 inches from the buttons.Now the down side.  The remote control was awful.  You must be at least 2 feet from the TV and less than maybe 8 feet AND the remote needed to be pointed directly at the sweet spot.  On top of that, buttons seem to work sometimes, like it had a mind of its own.  Especially the arrow buttons on the top part of the remote.  Vizio certainly cut costs on the remote.  Oh yeah, the 'LAST' button would not go to the last channel watched, but the last channel manually entered.  So if you use the chan up or down buttons, 'LAST' button is not going to work for you.  That leads me to the problem of changing channels.  It takes about 2-3 seconds to change channels using the chan up/down button and about 4-5 seconds when you manually enter a channel.  While the channel is changing, you get to stare at a bright blue screen.Finally, the sound is below average.  Of course with a TV as thin as the razor series, you're not going to get anything especially nice.  The volume was plenty loud and my TV actually sounded better with Surround On.  If you turn it off, it really did sound like a hollow tin can.I called Vizio about the Firmware updates I had been reading about on various forums.  The two people I talked to had no idea there was a firmware update and one actually told me there was no firmware update in the works.  My TV had update 2.13.Overall, like I said before, beautiful looking TV, great picture, below average sound, terrible remote, and very slow TV tuner.

My single complaint is that if a dvd player doesn't take up the whole screen, you'd think that you can press \"Auto\" for screen-fitting, and it'll expand, right? Not so. It will simply stretch it out, ignore the aspect ratio, and leave unnecessary black bars on the top and bottom.

I cleaned it with a very soft, dry cloth like you'd use to clean your fine eye wear with, problem solved.We've also seen the remote aiming issue.  No magic fix for this (other than maybe using a universal), you just have to point it to the left side of the screen somewhat to get it to work.  We use it from bed generally, so that gives us a remote operating distance of about 15 feet away.  Further back doesn't seem to help much, closer does narrow down where it likes having you shoot the remote at it.The sound is great.  It's very room filling and to us was startling loud when we first turned it on.

The reflections are really annoying if you use during the day.UPDATE May 18, 2010: the TV/monitor is really nice, but I guess that netflicks and online TV aren't streaming at 1080, so maybe that is the problem with the picture as DVDs look great on it. I can get used to the lights that stay on, but I would prefer no lights on in the front when watching videos. The darks are really dark, which is a problem with the glossy screen.

I owned it for a few years before the audio mysteriously cut out one day while playing a video game. Because I did not have a lot of money to spend on a high-quality brand name TV, I decided to buy another Vizio. I figured despite my first Vizio loosing Audio after only a few years, that the new version would work much better and since the TV was affordable and not to mention full of great features like the ability of 1080p and slim design I would buy it. Little did I know the problems that would come next. I ordered the TV and got it a few days later. I instantly loved the look of the TV. It reminded me of an oversize iPhone. Very sleek and stylish, pretty to look at and the 1080p resolution looked really good while playing Xbox 360 and watching Blu-Ray's on my PS3. However my problem with the TV first arose while watching a Blu-Ray. I was watching 'The Hurt Locker' which is a war movie with large sounds. While watching I suddenly heard a large clicking/static noise. Well because it was a war flick I was watching I thought it was the special effect noises in the film...that is until it got louder and when I paused the movie the sound continued a second or two after I paused...I WAS MAD! I just bought what I thought would be a TV to last me a few years until I could afford a better TV like a Sony or Samsung, but this TV was barely lasting 3 days before it started to crap out! I continued watching the film (Great movie btw) and didn't hear the sound again, so I figured maybe I was something on the Blu-Ray disc...because that happens often, right? That was two-weeks ago I watched the movie and didn't hear any noises like I heard that night while watching 'The Hurt Locker'...that is until the other night when the clicking/static returned much like the sound the smoke monster makes on 'Lost'! I am the type of person that needs the TV on to fall asleep...the static sound was so loud, mind you the TV sound was only on 3 or 4 max, that it woke me out of a sound sleep and this occured for 3 straight nights! I finally had it last night when it did it twice within a 15 minute span and that is when I signed-on to Amazon and was very happy to see I still had 1-week to return the TV for a refund, including the shipping fees!The only good thing about this TV is the picture quality and the fact I bought it from Amazon.

I first bought the Samsung LED Monitor 23 inch (Model XL2370) at b3stbuy. I returned it and got this Vizio TV at C0stc0 warehouse and used it as a monitor. I then returned it also. They are both around $300. I had a week to find something better to use as a monitor. Not being able to find anything else that was better, I tried to buy the vizio again. When I returned to c0stc0, they raised the price on the vizio buy $17 so I decided to order it on Amazon. This is why I bought the vizio again and decided not to go with any other.- Full 1080P- is LCD LED Back lit - so more energy efficient compared to regular plain LCD- has internal speakers - speakers are very low and tiny, don't expect heart thumping sound- has audio aux for plugging in headphones/speakers directly to TV - also SPDIF Digital Optical (Whatever that is...)- works as a TV and monitor, not just a monitor- is thin - not as thin as it should be but that's because its also a TV- has a beautiful design - I absolutely fell in love with it, that being said, i am very picky about design- Vizio has glass to glass - the whole monitor screen is glass including the borders, so basically the whole front is  glass - The glass is very reflective, I am a fan of glossy and glass and shine - Colors pop out more- other people may dislike this- has 2 hdmi input instead of just 1 like most monitors, then again its also a TV is why- includes VGA, s-video, rf connector for internal tuner, and rgb, not dvi though :/- is wall mountable VESA standard, unlike other thin LCD LED monitors out there - Samsung XL2370 is not wall mountable- has a usb port plug-in for photo viewing only is JPEG though - unlike other monitors out there, this is a neat featureCONS- only 60Hz - most monitors are 60hz now-a-days, this could of been 120hz because its also a TV?? and most 1080p tvs are 120hz... I think? you can get 120hz from a monitor, but most of them are the 3D monitors for gaming- ac plug is gigantic - This is so the tv itself isn't any fatter, placing it in the ac adapter- only 5ms response time - not 2ms - Don't really know or notice the difference but most monitors on 2ms. I think?- can only tilt not swivel- menu turns on when not even touched, only have to get close to it, I was far away like 15 inches but it still turned on... weird - that's because its touch sensor, but still most monitors don't do that - shame on you vizio- speakers suck (because its really thin), but using as a monitor most likely you'll have a set on your own speakers- controller is very small and unresponsive if not pointed directly to the sensor, also have to get very close to it in order to work - also feels cheap so don't pound on it already cus you only have 1- TV channels turn slowly- when using as monitor and picture is not detected the whole screen turns blue, reminds you its not only a monitor but also a TV - did not like the blue, other monitors just stay black- Does not include dvi port for computer - but 2 hdmi makes up for that?OverviewAll in all its good as a monitor but average as a TV. Like I said, the channels turn slowly, the remote feels cheap, and the sound is no where near as good even for just watching TV. A set of speakers can fix that though :/It has a lovely design, the glass adds nice glare to it, colors are more vibrant.

The next day I called \"Blech Support\" for Vizio and they gave me a couple of things to do and check which I did. I called the next day when even more problems with the set began such as not being able to change channels and the screen going blank for no reason at all. To keep this short Vizio support is atrocious. They spent more time trying to say that the problem is me and not their equipment. It is 2 weeks today and I am still trying to get them to take it back. How about \"yes sir we stand behind our products and we will take care of you right away!\" What a joke!!!

First the remote died. I took out the batteries and left them out for 24 hrs then put them back in and it has worked since then (but I recommend getting a programmable universal remote because the range is not good on the Vizio remote).Then the more serious issue - the sound corruption issue, after 30 minutes, consistently. We tried getting this addressed through the Costco \"concierge\" service (a joke), and Vizio's warranty. So even though it was still under warranty because it is a 23 inch TV, they said WE had to pay for shipping to a repair center. Shipping on a TV like this would cost a lot... they would not admit that it is a manufacturer's defect. A consistent issue like this (I compiled over 20 separate online reviews from different customers with the problem) IS a manufacturer's defect. Just because a couple of people here have not had problems does not mean that it is not a common problem. Also a good portion of people hook up separate speakers and cut the TV volume off so would not notice a problem with the sound corrupting.So Vizio customer service argued with me, failed to take responsibility for the defect, and accused me of causing the problem through misuse. Disgusting experience, and I will NEVER buy from this company again because of their phone person's lack of knowledge, sense, or civility.Well as a last ditch effort I wrote an email asking if there was a firmware update I could apply by USB and miracle of miracles, there is a file called fwsu.img sent by billie dot vanengen at vizio dot com with a pdf containing instructions for upgrading the firmware to version 2.17 via USB.The firmware upgrade to 2.17 PERMANENTLY resolved the corrupted sound issue. Why wouldn't the phone support person be aware of it?  If this wouldn't have worked, I would have just sold it on craigslist to try to recoup some of the expense (with an honest description of the sound issue, to target someone who would be hooking it up to speakers anyway) and been even more disgusted.Now today, the new Vizio issue du jour is that everything looks pastel (no deep blacks). Contrast and picture settings make no difference, but unplugging the HDMI and re-plugging it in corrects the issue. SO SICK OF THESE BUGS.Like I said, will never buy another Vizio product again based on this.

My speakers are powered Partner speakers by Acoustic Research (had em for 10+ years). At first I thought it didn't have enough gain to drive power to these speakers. I changed my audio setup and cables and it definitely made a difference and I can hear my audio much better.I Currently have this alongside my Gateway FPD2185W which is almost identical except the Vizio has HDMI and TV Tuner where my gateway doesnt. But my gateway has DVI which my Vizio doesnt have But you have to use a DVI-D Adapter to use it as a monitor. If you're using this as a monitor only thing don't even bother. I got this to accomodate all my gaming systems on a small footprint system (Replaced my 19\" KONKA Crappy TV). The touch sensative controls on the tv are a nice plus except you'll get it pretty dirty on occasion.This is a good solution if you are looking for a all-in-one type of solution in a small platform and really good energy efficient monitor. Its not PERFECT but is the closest thing I can find for the price that will fit in my specific space. I plan on getting a special LCD stand that will allow me to rotate it for my shooting games :).", "Date": "February 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "great TV", "Author": "Susan Baldy \"szzyq\"", "ReviewID": "R28ILQCXUCXDFO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have this TV for a month now and the picture quality is great.

But I head good review and is led and price is not too high.Prior this i own several other monitor like hp 2505m and samsung 23\" led. both are good monitor but suffer very poor input lag.  This other hand suffer none, i try pes 2010 and nba 2k10 in high setting, almost no lag, while other 2 monitor previous i own suffer lag, this is the same game hardware and windows 7 professional set up.The design i must gave this one higher than even samsung led one, the build quality of this one is bit better and a bit nicer look. I like that has metal edge.  Samsung one lack many thing, no speakers and no tuner, while vizio have both and about similar slim design.This one do had glossy screen, might be pro or cons for some people. I like glossy screen, this one isn't too heavy gloss like hp, the led backlight make nicer addtional of light without too much extra of power.This is not local dimm led unlike the big 55\" counsin. But does has smart light sensor that samsung led monitor don't had.The remote that come is very sleeck glossy design, is small suitable for me. I like the fact that i can plug optical sound from my logitech z680 to the monitor and work great, the speaker plug component audio cable to my pc.The major cons of this monitor, doesn't come with any cables except its own adapter. no hdmi, or vga or even antenna.This tv has no DVI input, but i get to work with hdmi to dvi pc input.  Older game might not detect 1600x1200 in warcraft 3.  but all new game i try no problem with 1080p.This tv actually produce better picture (with adjustment) than hp or samsung, out of the box is poor pictue, many setting got turn off, you need to turn those on.  I like the fact i can use my remote to control monitor menu, samsung led one is very hard to control the menu with only touch button.The build in speaker of this tv is very good, crip sound, only down size no bass like most tv anyway. Just get some decent speaker, suggest you grab one that has optical out.You can't mount this tv out of the box, and can't adjust height or swivel, if you are tall person you might need something to stand up this tv.  Make sure you register warrantly thought vizio or might not get warrantly at all.Vizio did make home run in this slim size led tv that suitable for both tv and monitor user.  I am happy buyer as now, if you had amex card make sure use it cause you never know what happend after 1 year.", "Date": "December 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Sound Issues", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3EF02U5JBTOA8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have used this screen with my laptop, whatching movies, and my Xbox 360 with no issues.

I use the TV set in the kitchen and have the Today show on as I get ready in the morning or the kids have Disney channel on while they are having an after-school snack.  I agree with most of the reviews listed here.  The sound quality is poor.  The TV picture is low contrast and the color saturation is weak.  The LED backlighting and the 1080p resolution may be nice bragging points, but they don't add up to anything more than an okay picture.  But the TV set itself looks sleek and when the screen is off you can mistake it for a much more expensive set.For my situation, this set is fine.  However, if I really wanted to sit down and watch an HD show from start to finish, I'd recommend spending a little more money and getting a 720p non-LED TV with much better picture and sound quality.", "Date": "February 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Ouch!

This set also utilize edge-lit LED backlighting, as opposed to local-dimming technology. Most of the image quality advantages often associated with LED backlighting--like deep blacks--are only available on local-dimming displays, so we don't expect radically better performance than standard (CCFL-backlit) LCD displays. So in other words not much you can do with deeper blacks. My issue was with even the logo was washed out. VIZIO was the first for me and the last. I ended up with DYNEX DX-L24-10A even though this isn't a LED the screen is 24\" to 24\" (25\")and uses less power. There is more inputs and suppose to have Ethernet connection.
