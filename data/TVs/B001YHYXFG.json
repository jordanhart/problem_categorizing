It has a good picture quality, and although the sound isn't great I don't care because I use external speakers when it matters.  My only complaint is that the menus are very very slow, especially changing inputs.  however, this is just a minor annoyance.", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$399.99", "Features": "Sharp LC-32SB23U 32-inch Widescreen LCD HDTV General Features: Black design 32-inch screen size\nAdvanced Super View/Black TFT LCD Panel ATSC/QAM/NTSC TV tuners 16:9 Aspect ratio\n1366 x 768 pixel resolution 7500:1 Dynamic Contrast Ratio (1500:1 native) 450 cd/m2 brightness\n6 ms response time 176-degree H/V viewing angle 10W x 2 audio system 60,000 hour lamp life\nEnglish, French and Spanish OSD language", "Name": "32\" Sharp LC-32SB23U 720p Widescreen LCD HDTV - 16:9 7500:1 6ms 2 HDMI ATSC/QAM/NTSC Tuners (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41t8GtDx1UL.jpg", "ProductID": "B001YHYXFG"}}
