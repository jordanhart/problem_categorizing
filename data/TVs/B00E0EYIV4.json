I was a little weary with it being a name that I have never heard but the screen/image quality is EXCELLENT. I was fully prepared to return this tv, but I must say that I am very impressed..An other review states that the image color changes at an angle. This is true... However, it is not an issue for us at all. I only notice it when standing directly beside the tv and who watches a tv from that angle?", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great affordable TV for Kids, Kitchen, Bath, RV (Extended Review)", "Author": "Liar! Return was denied after claim filed", "ReviewID": "R23IMU5Q4WJ4W1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: Aesthetics, Picture, Input options, Price, Low power consumptionCons: Poor single speaker, cheap remote control. Marginal base.Conclusion: We would buy this product again, we would recommend this product to a friend or family member at the right price.Appearance/Application: Looks great in our kitchen (see uploaded images), you really could not ask for more on how it looks, for a cheap TV its fantastic.  Paired this with a older Roku from the bedroom and we were up and running wireless in no time. All our home media streams to it along with Netflix etc. so we dont have to have a cable box or DVR in the kitchen. Compact package. Added a 5 year squaretrade warranty for this TV.  $62 + taxes is a solid deal.Picture: 720p, Good contrast. Vibrant color. Good brightness. Light bleed from top and bottom evenly, appears to be edge lit screen. Other reviews bashing the viewing angle are being critical for this price point, we can see the screen fine from a wide angle. Picture was better than expected. Quick cycle of the picture options on the dedicated remote button yields improved picture over power saving default.Sound: The speaker does face out the bottom and its not a good experience. Cycling sound preset options on dedicated remote button yields instant improvements. Its better sound than my Toshiba 24\" LED.  Sound was about what I expected out of a cheap 20\" TV.  The headphone jack volume is controlled with the remote control (for those that want to add external speakers yet retain volume control via remote) We are adding some $30 Logitech Z200 Multimedia Speakers 2.0 speakers to this TV. (4.5 Stars)Connectivity: 1 HDMI / 1 Composite / VGA with 3.5mm computer audio in / RCA Audio in / Coaxial Audio in / Headphone Jack out(See uploaded images to see all input/output panels clearly)Remote: Looks and feels fairly cheap. Battery door jiggles a bit. Its more than adequate and is full featured. (See uploaded image)Packaging: Very well packaged and shipped, small box. Easy to give for a gift and wrap it. Assembly includes 4 screws in bottom of base to neck, and 3 screws from neck to TV main unit. Phillips screwdriver is all that is required.Base:  is lacking some stability. Its just enough to get the job done but I do wish it was a bit more solid. For use in a kitchen for my application it will do fine. Anyone not using the base will find this to be a non issue. Its not flimsy, it just has some movement if you grab the bezel and try to move the TV, it shifts around a little bit.*Update regarding base problems* Manufacturers packaging error in screws led to poor loose fit of base and tilting.I received 3 small screws and 4 larger screws in error. We deemed the original TV too wobbly and returned it for exchange. Calling manufacturer help line on instructions and yielded no useful support. The replacement is better, containing 4 small screws and 3 longer ones in reverse of our first shipment. The base is much more solid than before, yet still leaves a bit to be desired.", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not finding digital channels!

We contacted the company and after talking to a tech support rep, we instructed to ship it back to them (at our own expense) and they would ship us a new one because our malfunctioning unit was still under their \"great\" 1 year warranty.We shipped it to their location in Mississippi (at a personal cost of $120) We were initially instructed to email the tracking number to the rep we had originally spoken with to speed up the process of them shipping us the new one. We shipped out the originally TV on Nov. 20th.  We never received any confirmation that they had received the number or later the product until we called 2 weeks later. After being on hold for 30+min on several occasions (most times we were sent to voice-mail) we were told everything was in line to ship and to expect our new TV within 7-14 business days. After two more weeks, we called back. still no TV. we were told that they no longer made our model and we would have to wait until a refurbished model was available. Already having waited a month for this replacement, we refused to accept this and finally got a supervisor to approve an upgrade to the next size up. We have since been waiting for the replacement, approaching two months now. Every time we have called, we are told its waiting to be shipped or they are backed up and it will take up to 5 weeks to ship or their warehouse is out of stock. Every time a new story. We are out several hundred dollars between the initial purchase of this TV along with shipping it back.

Image quality is really good but Im sure if someone with calibration skills could make this excellent in terms of picture and \"good\" in terms of sound.

Its simply too small to play games on, lol.I did tweak the settings around and noticed a major thing to make sound better.  Go to the menu, then to \"audio,\" scroll down to \"surround sound\" and turn it to \"on\".

I actually changed my review from 4 stars to 5.  For about $75 bucks, this TV is amazing if it fits your specific use.  I thought the TV would do for a year... but its just to small.

They're inexpensive because they from a company headquartered in China where things are relatively more inexpensive altogether, and are manufactured in California to avoid pricey shipping costs and import taxes.The screen is very nice and MUCH better quality than any other cheaper set, in fact it's just as good if not better than any mid-range product out there. They use the same electronics as Vizio (you should even be able to use your Vizio remote to control it if you like).The remote that comes with it works great, feels good, but looks cheap. Tiny trimmings like a plastic overlay on the back panels where you connect your input wires is missing leaving uncovered metal, but it makes no difference at all unless you have your set in the middle of the room rather than up against a wall because otherwise you'll never be looking at the back of your TV. The stands are hit and miss - mine is fine but some people have written reviews saying theirs was wobbly.One weird quirk this TV has is that in order to adjust the color, tint, and sharpness you have to press MENU, then 0000 (hit the Zero button four times). The regular menu doesn't let you change much - just brightness and contrast on a \"User\" picture mode or switch between factory presets like \"movie\", \"sports\", and the like. Hitting 0000 in the menu lets you play with the factory settings where you can adjust the other options.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Surprised with how good this TV is for the price", "Author": "Barry Brown", "ReviewID": "R378TTUJ0VFPFY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I asked for this little Seiki 20\" TV for a Christmas present after reading some so-so reviews here and wondering if I should get it... but I went ahead since it was very inexpensive. I opened it up at Christmas, and it's packaged well - a very compact box that includes the remote and batteries with a manual and quick start guide.I wanted this TV for a room where I have a computer and some ham radio equipment, so I wanted this TV to double as a monitor for that computer. After attaching the base (4 screws that are included to attach the vertical part to the base, then 3 screws to attach the entire base to the TV), I plugged it in and plugged an antenna into it (antenna is not included). For an inside antenna, I picked up a lot of channels, so the TV tuner is really pretty good at picking up signals that have decent strength.For some reason I can't adjust the tint - the tint slider is greyed out - but right out of the box the picture looks pretty decent and doesn't need tint adjustment. I did have to back off the color a few notches, but I'm pleased with the picture on this Seiki!Next I got a computer monitor cable (also not included) and connected the VGA connection to my computer. After updating my video card driver (an old XP Nvidia graphics card) so I could run the widescreen 1366 x 768 resolution, it came right up and looks very nice. It's definitely no worse than the 20\" LCD LG monitor that this TV/monitor replaced.I can highly recommend this TV since it's so cheap.
