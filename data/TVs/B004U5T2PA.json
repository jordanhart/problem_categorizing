{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Value", "Author": "Eric D. Mammen \"RIC 9\"", "ReviewID": "R2UW3ZRNJ3A2W1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received the E472VL three days ago and have been exploring and evaluating its various features.First off: Here is a list of the features I wanted in my new TV.42-47 inches1080p120 hzInternet connectivity (primarily Netflix...despite their recent price increase BAH!)Enough HDMI ports for my XBOX 360, PS3 and cable (minimum 3)No more than $800First Impressions:  I upgraded from a 3 year old 32 inch Sony Bravia, which served me well through college and since graduating, but it was time to upgrade to something more suitable for my living room (about 14 ft x 18 ft).  My viewing distance is around 10 feet and this TV is definitely big enough for me. I'm not an interior designer, but the styling seems pretty standard. All black bezel. The outside of the bezel is matte while the inner edge closest to the screen is gloss. It is a nice two tone effect, but the styling of the tv was of a little concern. The base is large and glossy, and it does not swivel like many other models. Having a swiveling base was not important to me either as I rarely move the TV. Some other Vizio TV reviews note issues with the TVs turning off randomly periodically. I did experience this once in the first hour of using the TV. After rebooting the TV it automatically downloaded a firmware update and has not turned off again. Also, this TV does not come with the QWERTY remote like some other Vizios. Viewing facebook/twitter works very well on this TV, but if you want to post comments/updates you may want to consider a TV with a keyboard remote.Features:  I felt this model was the best balance of features and price. I do generally prefer to buy big brand name electronics (Sony, Samsung, LG), but there were a number of features I wanted, which can't be had in this price range with those brands. Getting the newest, fanciest LED tv was not a priority for me as that is a still a new technology and I can only see marginally improved black levels during side by side comparisons, and that is only with full-array LED tvs with local dimming. That technology still demands a premium of about 150-200 dollars, and has not reached its full potential.  Internet Apps: The internet apps have worked flawlessly in my short time with the TV. The interface Vizio has created is one of the best i've seen. My parents have an internet connected TV; when the apps are opened the entire screen is dedicated to scrolling through and choosing your desired app. With the Vizios, a small bar of apps appears along the bottom of the screen, which you scroll through to find the app you want all while the TV signal is displayed over the rest of the screen. When you select and app, ~1/3 of the screen becomes dedicated to that app. You can get a quick facebook or twitter update while still watching TV on the right 2/3s of the screen. Some other apps (Netflix, amazon instant video) will then expand into full-screen mode after selecting \"launch app\" or once you've made a video selection. It is a great, responsive interface. You can delete \"widgets\" you don't use and move them wherever you want along the scroll bar.  120 hz: I haven't watched any hockey or sports for that matter, but the smooth motion technology can definitely be seen when it is turned on. As many people have said, it does look a little funny, and isn't appropriate for all content. I keep the option set to low or off most of the time, but for some shows it is nice to have on, which is where the different \"picture modes\" come in handy. There are 9 separate modes which can all be changed individually and selected quickly while watching the TV so you can immediately see the effect.Performance:  Picture: This TV has a wonderful picture. Vizios are known for accurate and vibrant colors. That is certainly apparent here. The black levels are always the question mark as there is no standardized way to measure contrast ration, so 100,000: 1 on a Vizio vs. 2,000,000 : 1 on a Samsung doesn't necessarily mean the Samsung will be 20x better. The black levels are completely acceptable for my use. I am not a videophile, but I have researched and viewed many tvs. I have seen tvs with noticabley bad black levels and plasmas with amazing black levels. This TV should pass all but the most hardcore videophile's critique. Compared to my old Sony this is a major upgrade.  Sound: A common complaint about these thin TVs is the poor speakers. In my fairly large, open and carpeted (carpets will reduce sound travel and require you to turn the volume up louder than in a room with hardwood floors) family room, the speakers perform admirably for everyday TV viewing. I only have to turn the volume up high when I have the windows open and a fan blowing. However, I do have a surround sound set up, which I use for movie watching. The SRS TruVolume technology does not seem to have any affect while channel surfing, which is unfortunate, but I commend them for trying. The SRS SurroundSound is noticeable. When switching between basic stereo sound and surround, the \"surround\" option creates much more full and real sounding audio.  Videogames: Here is where I had my first real fright. I tested for any input lag (a well known issue with some LCD HDTVs) by playing Geometry Wars 2 on XBOX. It's not a graphical stunner, but it requires split second input and reaction time. At first there was noticeable lag. After scanning through the picture settings I could not find any cure. Important Note: the various \"picture modes\" include a \"gaming\" setting. It is important to remember these settings are mainly there for you to modify to your liking. The names are more there for your convenience. However, in the \"settings\" tab of the menu there is a \"gaming\" mode option. The option only becomes available once you switch from the \"TV\" input to the input your console is connected to. This did remedy the input lag.  Menu/Interface: Like I said previously, the menu can be viewed while watching TV, which makes optimizing your picture settings a breeze. Also, any settings you choose for each input, will save to that specific input. E.G. After turning \"gaming mode\" \"on\" on HDMI-1 for my XBOX, that setting will save to HDMI-1 so you don't have to change it every time you switch devices. The same goes for the picture and audio modes selected. It is a very convenient system.  Overall:  I am very pleased with this TV. 42\" TVs with similar features were only $50-$100 cheaper. I feel the extra 5 inches is worth it especially if you are on the fence as far as size like I was. The picture is terrific. The sound is completely acceptable if there is not too much background noise, otherwise consider a beefier set up.  Sorry for the drawn out and wordy review, but I hope it was helpful to some of you. I actually waited a couple extra weeks before buying this TV hoping someone would write an in-depth review. I would be happy to answer any questions in the comments section if I missed anything.", "Date": "July 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "awesome tv at an awesome price", "Author": "mysierra4x4", "ReviewID": "R2ITU70JTA2DBW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i bought this tv and im very happy with it.shipping was right on the money.picture is awesome. added a vizio sound bar and the sound is outstanding.the only con with this tv is the volume. without the sound bar addition you have to put the volume up very high to hear it. at least up to 55 or 60 to get a good affect.other than that very happy with it.would recommend to anyone thinking of buying it.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love this TV!!!", "Author": "Cupcake", "ReviewID": "R3BFSS320MM3E6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price, this TV is a great buy.  If you are looking for a budget-friendly HDTV with internet apps, I highly recommend this TV. Easy set up, great picture & sound quality.  I have no complaints with the volume level as mentioned in other reviews.  I have never had the volume above maybe 30.

Price was great, picture was great using DirecTV and an HDMI cable.  The internet app set up was very nice and there was a LOT there.  Wireless set up was a snap to connect to our N router.  Netflix worked awesome!Audio problems started out of the box though.  Sound would drop every 15 seconds then come back after a second or so.  I tried live broadcast, I tried programs we had DVR'd that I knew were of good quality.  I tried DVD and VHS (yes VHS...we still have one!)  After reading some forums and messing with it for nearly an hour I gave up and called Vizio support.  They had me restart (unplug) the TV, go through a cleansing procedure at start up and the problems continued.  We continued changing settings on the D-TV box and the TV but nothing helped.  I asked my wife and kids to try it the next day and see if it got any better.  When I came home from work I was met at the door from my kids telling me that the TV had to go.The TV has been returned and I've ordered a Panasonic.  I was really hoping to like this TV because of the generous assortment of features and the great picture.  Had the audio not been a problem, we would have definitely kept the TV.  I hope you have better luck and I hope I got the lemon off the streets for you.Jeff", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "High Quality Picture, Fast Speed & Convenient Apps That We Use for Instant Streaming Video - Like the 120 hz", "Author": "christinemm  from The Thinking Mother blog", "ReviewID": "R1RVT7P8W6GLRL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We moved long distance and got rid of all our old TVs as they were in danger of breaking in transit and would not be covered by the moving insurance. We love this new TV that we've been using for almost two months with Comcast cable and DSL wifi Internet with AT&T.; We like it so much we selected this one again to buy for our home's second TV. So, we own two of these models now.The picture quality is very good.The HD is excellent. (These are our first HD TVs.) I was surprised to see that on our second set, which we chose to rent a less expensive Comcast cable box without HD, the picture does not fill the screen. The size of the images varies between two different sizes depending on the program and has a big black border all around the edges. We were trying to save some money on the monthly rental fee for the cable box by having no HD on the set we use much less but now I'm not sure it's worth it due to the size difference.Having the apps on the TV is very convenient for instant streaming through Amazon.com and Netflix. It is simple to use and therefore you do not have to hook a laptop up to the TV screen to view the internet streamed video on the TV screen. Honestly I don't need Facebook or Twitter on my *television*! I mainly want the apps for easiest instant streaming of video.This model is 120 hz which makes it more expensive than the 60 hz models that Vizio sells (and the same goes for other brands). A commenter to my review explained it this way \"The hz is the screen refresh rate. The hz is how many times/second the tv displays the picture. It wouldn't directly impact streaming quality. Only your internet connection would affect that. Where you would notice the difference between 60hz and 120hz is in fast moving video segments, like in sports or movie/tv scenes where there are fast moving objects. 60hz displays the picture 60 times/second while 120hz is double that.\"  While in a warehouse store recently (where it is fast and easy to compare different models with the same screen size) I noted that most TVs in this screen size range with HD were only 60 hz. Make your selection carefully based on how you plan to use the TV.We also figured out that the price of the TV with the apps built in was less expensive or equal than buying an intermediary unit to run the instant streaming through; we chose the built-in apps for convenience as it is one less piece of machinery and it would have less wires to deal with.SOUND ISSUES with CABLE TV  ---  Just a couple of days after installing the TV our sound cut out when viewing cable TV. We troubleshooted the problem to be a bad, cheap quality cable that was provided to us free from Comcast to hook the TV to the cable box. We paid about $20 out of pocket for a new HDMI (best quality) cable. The choice of what cable to pick is shown on a chart on page 7 of the user manual with there being 5 choices on the market with Vizio recommending the best most expensive one (HDMI = $20). After spending this much on a TV I don't mind spending $20 on the HDMI cable! However I do resent the cable company with their expensive prices giving us such a cheaper useless one, really they should give out HDMI cables!SOUND ISSUES with XBox360 --- A couple of weeks into using the TV with the xBox360 the sound started cutting out off and on. We have troubleshooted it to the cable wire again as the sound on the TV is just fine.The instruction manuals are very good and have lots of visuals including color photographs for the steps. The set was simple to set up and my eleven year old son has been hooking them up with ease.", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "We love this tv!", "Author": "myturntoplay", "ReviewID": "RK1UMY867606H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a 65 inch wide screen projection tv that was going dark intermittently so I was looking for something that took up less space to replace it. My husband and I are older and not teribly tech savvy but we heard about streaming movies and tv shows through game consoles. When we saw this tv we decided to look into the whole internet tv and streaming thing. We went to walmart and watched this tv next to an LG tv. The Vizio looked just as nice but with a lighter price tag. I went home, got on Amazon.com and found the same tv for almost 100.00 less. We bought it for 699.99 total! Free shipping and it was here in about 5 days. All we did was plug it in and follow the easy instructions on the screen to find our wireless router. The picture is so beautiful you feel like you are on the set where the content is being filmed. We signed up with netflix and hulu plus, bought an HD antenna and cancelled the 68.00 per month basic cable. We are saving so much money on cable that this tv is paying for itself. I've never been a huge tv person but now my husband and I are in our family room streaming movies, tv shows, documentaries and rediscovering our local channels everyday. I just talked my sister into buying the same tv. I've been telling everyone about it. Beautiful picture, NO CABLE BILL, and easy enough for anyone to use! We love it! If you are going to buy a new tv go with the internet tv! No special cables or hookups with this tv. It's built right in.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "great price great TV", "Author": "Laura L.

McClendon \"Mistress of Useless Trivia\"", "ReviewID": "R2SZO6C21ZPB3O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was skeptical about an Internet television. While I'm a bit of a gadget geek, it just seemed a little bit TOO geeky for me. But since I wanted more streaming options beyond what my XBox 360 could provide, I decided to take a leap and pick up this bad boy. Honestly, I made a great decision getting this TV. The picture is wonderful. The sound, although a *bit* quiet, is plenty loud enough in my smaller apartment living room. Using the suggestions of another reviewer, I set my TV to use game mode settings so I wouldn't experience any issues with my 360, and I have had no lag or strange framerate issues. It looks fantastic. Setting up Internet connectivity was a breeze, and some of the widgets are really great - more convienent than I thought they actually would be! (Pandora, Hulu, etc.) The streaming of movies and clips from Amazon Instant Video, Hulu, etc. has been smooth as glass.Overall, if this is your first venture into Internet television, this is a great choice. The lower price point doesn't mean a lesser user experience. I'm extremely happy!", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Flat Screen", "Author": "John H.

Very easy set up, picked up my network right away and does a great job streaming videos from Netflix.  Having had another Vizeo I did not notice the sound issue that many reported.  I do have an optical cable going to and amplifier for movies and music but don't use it for regular TV.  We have been happy with our three Vizio's.  Did not get it at Amazon because a local box store had it at the same price but I would have.A note on Vizio's, many box stores want to sell you a service contract at the register but you have to save the box.  When you register with Vizio you can buy a contract from Vizio that is usually cheaper and offers in home service.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Steve  Dietrich", "ReviewID": "R2FHEJ352K4P0I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent the better part of 2 hours looking at an array of TV's side by side. Finally I bought the VIZIO for its picture quality and competitive pricing. There was an immediate need so Costco was the source, even though I had to pay CA sales tax.Assembly of the stand was simple, I appreciated the restraint cable and will install it as soon as the TV's final location is determined. Setup went quickly, including the interface with Direct TV which I was using with an old TV.  The setup guide was refreshingly brief.If you loose the remote, the basic controls are on the side of the tv and easily reachable.  There's lots of input options on the rear of the tv and thoughtfully there are extra input ports on the side so that you do not need to get behind the TV to make a temporary connection. Multiple input sources pretty much cover the entire spectrum of technology.HDMI with HDCP:  3 Rear, 1 SideComponent Video (YCrCB):  1 RearComposite Video:  1 RearComputer RGB:  1 RearRF Connector for Internal Tuner:  1 RearEthernet:  1 RearUSB 2.0:  2 SideOptical Digital Out (SPDIF):  1Analog Audio Out (RCA):  1Sound is great.  I planned to buy a sound system to go with the TV but will defer that decision for a while. It passes the real test with music only from the Direct TV system.  Quality is excellent. It's not a $thousands sound system but great for most applications.At the end the key question is always , would you make the same purchase decision and the answer is yes.

The adjustment menus are great, with many options at your disposal.The other great aspect of this TV is the apps. Netflix, Twitter, Pandora, etc, are all at your fingertips. The interface can sometimes be clunky (the remote does not have a keyboard so you have to s-l-o-w-l-y type everything onscreen), but if you use your PC to set things up and then just use the TV for access, everything works great.

It's nice to be able to connect to Netflix and some of the other apps straight from the TV, and I have no complaints about the image quality.  However, the device runs a little slow while you are navigating, starting up the internet apps and connecting to services.  I've found that it's just easier to use my Apple TV and PS3 for connecting to the internet.  Also, I didn't realize when I bought this TV that I would be adding a \"media center\" ... basically a sound bar and wireless subwoofer to get a better sound experience.  If I had, it might have been good to know that the Vizio E472VL does NOT offer Audio Return Channel (ARC) support over HDMI.  This is a nice-to-have feature that allows you to connect your media center via a single HDMI cable and use that connection for sending audio back to the media center speakers.  Without ARC, you have to add another connection (e.g. optical) from the TV to the media center.Hope that helps the next buyer.", "Date": "June 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "VERY GOOD TV FOR THE MONEY", "Author": "Bash", "ReviewID": "R39CJO5JBNSCUW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this TV from Costco, day before the super bowl and not for viewing the game but for my bed room I was watching HD without a cable box within 15 minutes.

No wonder it's known as Amazon's showroom.Only complaints - the remote is small and hard to use. It takes some time to switch between input options.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "About the E472VL remote control", "Author": "Todor Mazgalev \"Ted\"", "ReviewID": "R1H03VPOHSLJTQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In a separate comment to the excellent review by Eric D Mammen I \"complained\" about the remote control that came with the VIZIO I have just purchased. Here I will repeat only the essence, and would appreciate a feedback:The remote control, allegedly model VR17 - VIA (without a keyboard on back), has 2 identical buttons labeled INFO and GUIDE, respectively.The previously intended useful function of the GUIDE button to show a program list for the following program hours (\"digital episode guide\") has been eliminated without any further explanation. It is difficult to understand why VIZIO did not physically remove 1 of the redundant buttons instead of giving lengthy \"excuse\" that starts with the funny statement: \"VIZIO is continually improving its products to protect the Earth...Pressing the GUIDE button no longer displays an onscreen digital episode guide, so the GUIDE button now functions in the same way as the INFO button\".It sure does, but this is also funny, isn't it?Are there different remote controls that come with this VIZIO model, that permit usage of the originally intended function of the GUIDE button?", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "What an awesome tv!", "Author": "jd", "ReviewID": "RBTDUX8H1ZF1Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I are completely satisfied with our purchase.

First thing I noticed was the sound wasn't that great, and it got worse over time.  I now have to keep the sound up all the way.  Today the TV went black and lost sound as well.  This TV should have lasted longer.  I have a 32 inch RCA that was bought in 1996 that played 24/7 up until my husband died in 2009.  This RCA is still working.  Picture quality is great.  Sound is great, no problems.  I want to tell everyone that the Vizio is not a good TV.

The picture is kinda dark, so got to figure out the settings to enhance.
