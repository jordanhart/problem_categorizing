{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A good TV for narrower spaces, with high-tech, logically placed controls. Made in North America.", "Author": "Bob", "ReviewID": "R14R668JOYVQ04", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We were looking for the largest TV possible to fit a cabinet in our master bedroom.  This model fit with 1/10 of an inch to spare.  To accomplish this we had to have buttons on the bottom or front, not on the sides. The buttons on this model are actual touch controls along the bottom front bezel which give a sleek, smooth look and seem to work well.The picture quality is excellent through the HDMI connector from AT&T;'s Uverse service. The remote was easy to setup - be sure to look under the HDTV section of your manual remote.The sound is very good, though it lacks some bass -- which is to be expected for a panel this thin.  If you must have perfect sound, I'd suggest investing in a sound-bar or surround system you can hook up to your input source.We liked all of the controls and settings it provides -- for instance you can even decide how the power LED functions.  We like the fact you can turn the LED off if you are using it a bedroom.  LG did a good job on the layout of the on-screen menus and the buttons.  The Picture Wizard is a fun way to adjust the picture quality  The TV even has a manual and online-help within its menus..This model seems to be similar to 24LN4510 except it uses about 10% less energy.  I could not confirm any other differences, so see the reviews of that model for other thoughts.For those who care, our new LG 24LN451B 24 inch LED TV was made in Mexico.", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Is this a TV or a heater?", "Author": "Jamie Richardson \"Wife, Mother, Writer\"", "ReviewID": "R1X2HLKIYEKU67", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We bought this as a Christmas gift for our daughter who wanted a TV in her room for Netflix. It was the right size and price when on sale before Christmas. It has a good picture quality, and it was easy enough to set up, but this unit puts off a massive amount of heat if used for any amount of time. There is honestly a good 7-10 degree difference between her room and her brothers' room after a single movie... with the bedroom door open. The unit itself isn't hot (it's not a fire hazard), but it just gives off a lot of heat.I would only purchase this set if it will be used in an open area.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Decent small TV", "Author": "inthedark", "ReviewID": "RVKL0KUA7W1DN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I haven't put this though its paces yet but I like it so far. Picture is good (720p), color is decent, and most impressive is the sound, plenty loud with good quality for this size screen. The controls on the remote are a little funky with 3 buttons bringing up the same settings menu but the menus are easy to learn and use. Initial setup is intuitive and fast. Auto tune found the DISH receiver channel with no problem and set the tv to it.

This is the second LG tv I've purchased (first was in Dec 2013) and the settings are not only user-friendly, but are non-tech easy.  The one big drawback (and I'm actually still deciding if I should return the tv for this reason) is the poor maximum volume.

This TV replaces a 22inch Samsung and what I really like is that they are about the same dimensions.  This TV has a picture that almost goes out to the edge, way more so than Sammy.  The image with just an antenna hookup  is amazing.  The only gripe I have so far is with the remote, it doesn't sit flat on a hard surface but I can live with that.  Highly recommended and I'm impressed with this seller too.

I bought this set to replace the one in my kitchen so I can use the LG tv guide feature which shows the progress of a program.  I also have the LG 47\" 3d led set which is also outstanding.  The only tiny complaint I have is I would like a dedicated sleep button on the remote instead of have to go to a menu first. Not a big deal. I recommend LG to my friends now.  They even included a screwdriver to attach the base in case someone doesn't have one handy. The INFO menu has a bar showing the progress of a program so the viewer can see instantly if he has tuned into the beginning of a show or worse just at the very end-- very useful to avoid watching something that is just about to end.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice 2nd tv", "Author": "Cat Mommy58", "ReviewID": "R2E3GHT9DJJSO9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ordered this for the bedroom.  Nice pic and all but the volume on it is kind of low.  Not sure if its the fault of the tv or the cable box.  Don't need real loud for the bedroom anyway but you may not like it for your main tv.

I was able to find this TV on sale and got it for a slightly better price than the on-line price. For a MAC mini you need a monitor that has an HDMI slot or something equivalent (basically my old flat screen computer monitor would not work with the MAC mini because of the inputs and the type of signal that the MAC puts out vs what the old monitor takes). I do not intend to use this as a TV, but purchased it as a monitor because the price was similar to the price of a monitor and it is a much more flexible product vs just a monitor.
