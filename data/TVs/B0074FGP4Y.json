Out of the box the picture looked awful and I was ready to return this set. Then I was lucky enough to find a review by \"Gordon\" for the Samsung UN32EH5000. I used the exact settings he specified and now the picture looks great.

Unlike CCFL lighting, LEDs don't diminish in brightness over time and have an incredibly long lifespan. Additionally, these sets are significantly lighter than their old CCFL counterparts which makes moving them around easier. However, this model is not edge-lit which means it's not really thinner despite the weight savings. The lights are directly behind the screen (i.e. direct-array), which many video purists prefer since it makes the lighting more even. This model does not support local dimming.Pros:1080pDirect array LED lightingDeep blacksBuilt-in WiFiVery lightweight3 HDMI ports2 USB ports (including 1 that has extra power for portable hard drives)Great DLNA support and file playback support (including 720p MKV files!)Keyboard and Mouse support via USBCons:Semi-glossy screenLackluster soundLack of swivel baseNo S-Video portU.I. is consistently clunkySome important settings are made obscureDisplayTo start off, the display is fantastic. Colors are rich and the blacks are deep. The set only supports 60hz, but I have never really found myself needing more than that. The lighting is mostly even, but there is noticeably dimming in the corners of the set. The screen is semi-glossy, which I dislike greatly because I can see reflections of myself or the room in darker scenes. Glare from windows is also pretty obvious, so definitely factor that in about where to put this set before you buy it. The bezel which actually makes it look smaller than it is for some reason. The controls for the set are a 4-way joystick hidden under the bottom right side of the bezel.SoundThe problem with thinner TVs is that sound suffers. My last LCD TV was a regular CCFL set and it had excellent sound. I am not an audiophile at all, but I can't find an audio setting I like for watching regular TV or movies. Either the dialogue is drowned out by music with heavy bass, or you can hear the dialogue (with added bass) and the music is barely audible. I fiddled around with a lot of settings and I just can't find one I like. After a few weeks I've gotten used to it, but for the first time ever I'm considering getting a stereo system to get \"normal\" sound back.ConnectivitySamsung has reduced the number of HDMI ports on their cheaper, no-frills models to encourage people to upgrade to their more expensive lines. The \"dumb\" models only have 2 HDMI ports, this one has 3. Additionally, it seems as though no models support S-Video any more, and this set integrates composite and component into one set of ports. There are two USB ports, one of which is labeled as the \"hard drive\" port because it supplies extra power. WiFi is built in, and I'm able to stream content from YouTube without stuttering or buffering. The TV can download and apply updates very easily, too. After the last update, file playback includes 720p MKV files, although options during playback are limited. DLNA support is fantastic, but refreshing of file lists doesn't work very well. The menu has settings that allow for mouse and keyboard control via USB, which is useful if you use searches a lot in the smart TV apps. It would be great if you could sign into Samsung's app site and click which ones you want to download rather than doing it from the TV. The interface in general is kind of clunky.OverallIt's a great buy. Lots of connectivity, access to smart apps (I enjoy the YouTube one, Netflix is also available and they are adding more). Definitely recommended.Tips and CaveatsIf you plan to use this as a monitor, make sure you label the source as \"PC\" of some kind. This removes a lot of post-processing. There is also a \"Game Mode\" under general that makes the display more responsive, but the downside to using this mode for me is that audio is stuck in \"movie\" mode which is very bass heavy.", "Date": "June 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Must change name of source to 'PC' if using as computer monitor", "Author": "Phoney", "ReviewID": "R1UC4CWUCYUMPS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am using this as a large computer monitor, so the TV and Smart features are just an added bonus.  As soon as I got it unboxed, I plugged in the HDMI output from my late-model AMD 7850 video card, set it to 1920x1080, and was very disappointed with the picture quality.  It ran off the screen and everything looked fuzzy.  No amount of tweaking in the AMD control panel made any significant difference.  I was about to pack it up when I stumbled across a review here on Amazon where somebody briefly mentioned changing the source name.  He didn't say how, so I had to figure it out.  Just hit SOURCE on the remote, followed by TOOLS and then EDIT NAME on the menu.  Change the name to either \"PC\" or \"PC-DVI\" and the picture instantly clears up.  You get 1:1 pixel mapping and everything looks great!  This made such a huge difference I thought I would share since it didn't seem to be mentioned anywhere else.", "Date": "June 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV, Software is just OK, Advice on getting Amazon Prime Video to Work", "Author": "R. W. Cope II", "ReviewID": "R3BJ1B536J2JT4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The picture on this TV is great.  Even non HD content looks nice, and HD content is outstanding.  I give it three stars because, as of November 2012, the software requires some significant effort to get working completely, and that may not be for everyone.I bought this model not only for the great picture, but for its ability to connect to services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.  They work well, though they are bit slow to launch. Finding content using the remote that comes with this TV is a bit tedious.  I recommend using a computer to find what you want to watch on those services, and adding it to your queue.  Then you can launch the app on the TV, bring up your queue, and start watching more easily.The only snag for me in setting up the TV was getting the latest version of the Samsung software.  After connecting to internet (which was easy), the TV updated all the software, which took about 15 minutes.  Unfortunately, all the required updates were not available to the TV through its online update mechanism, and that caused the Amazon Prime Video software to fail to run.  It complained that the Samsung Smart Hub software needed to be updated, but the Smart Hub software reported that there were no updates to be found.Fortunately, a call to Amazon cleared up the problem.  They informed me that Samsung had an update on their website that I could download, load on a USB thumb drive, and install on the TV.  Doing that solved the problem.  If you have this problem, you can get the latest version of the Samsung firmware from their support pages (sorry, Amazon doesn't allow links to external websites in reviews).  Instructions on installing the update from a USB thumb drive are also available there.So bottom line, the TV is great.  The software is fiddly, and requires some hubbub to get updated properly.  If you are willing to work through that, however, the experience of using the TV is very good.", "Date": "November 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "KEYBOARD AVAILABILITY", "Author": "Jon J.

This is my first flat screen TV. I did a lot of homework before zeroing on this TV.I purchased it based on the following features: - It is a smart HDTV, LED  - 60Hz and this year's model available at considerably better price as compared to even last year models with similar features. Though, I would have been very happy if I could have closed the deal at $ 650 :-pI did see the earlier reviews for this TV but most seemed like user training issues.The sound/picture quality is excellent. Picture quality will seem dull with the eco friendly setting of Standard. However, it is configurable per your liking and the user manual is very effective in identifying and setting up your needs. 3 HDMI + 2 USB availableSetting up Network/WI FI is also very easy.Depending on Internet speed, the smart TV works good. Youtube videos does not stream so fast for me directly through the TV but when I connect to my laptop through HDMI, it just works fine.Movies through Netflix are great. No 3D but I did not want it. The LED TV comparison chart that Amazon provides is very helpful in determining what features you need and what you do not need.The Kids stories is very useful for my 3 yr old son. Recently saw our first 1080p HD movie \"Journey to the center of the earth\" and it was GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Movie files with .vob,.avi and .wmv works perfect. I have not tried others yet. Even, if some do not work, there are many sites where we have converters available. So this is not a big deal too.On the whole, it is a great TV with very good features. Its a good tradeoff between the basic models this year and the higher end versions which made it attractive for me. I did not have to settle for a lower less feature version nor wanted to go for umpteen number of features with a higher version costing above 1000 bucks.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best in class LED TV esp. after you tweak settings", "Author": "JB", "ReviewID": "R19CBKJXJZIUL3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased two of these Samsung 32EH5300s over the holidays, and I am greatly impressed with them.  The \"full-array\" LED lighting makes the TV a bit deeper than the typical edge lit LED TV, but in return you get much more even lighting and an overall better viewing experience.  I was also surprised to see how good the Samsung does with standard def (SD) signals - of course not as good as HD quality but much better than the horrible quality I've seen on some LCD / LED TVs in the past.The three HDMI inputs is a must (sad to see so many other smaller TV now down to only two or even one HDMI input).  And of course the vast number of Smart TV features is great - I've already set up Netflix, YouTube, and HBO Go, while I continue to explore more offerings.One thing that I've found on all TVs including the Samsung is that the proper calibration / setup is essential to get the best picture.

This TV is a well kept secret and has all the \"next gen\" features of a SMART HDTV.Without getting much into the technical details of the TV..1) Great Picture Quality... Samsung is the best in the business and lives up to it's reputation.2) Amazing surround sound.. you won't be disappointed3)High number of HDMI and USB ports.. You can plug in your Roku, DVD Player, Cable Set top box connection.. etc without needing an adapter to increase HDMI ports(4) Best of all.. I have lots of movies on my Portable USB Hard Drive, I plug it in the TV and *BOOM* I am able to watch ALL the movies from my USB Drive.. All popular formats supported including avi.(5) This TV has built in apps for Netflix, youtube etc... Roku.. Who needs Roku?? Sell it off in eBay and pocket the Money!The setup was easy.. piece of cake. Also, it's easy to install the TV stand (included with the TV) and get started right away. Buy this one compared to the other Smart TVs which Samsung sells.... You won't regret this purchase!!! (3D.. Who needs 3D?...Meh.. I surely will look stupid sitting in front of the TV with those ugly 3D glasses.. Still a long way to go for 3D to catch up)One small thing which I need to mention.. When I ordered the TV, the bezel was cracked below the SAMSUNG logo. I called amazon and they immediately arranged for a new TV to be delivered for free the NEXT DAY and my old TV got picked up from my apartment by the UPS guy..No hassle to drop it at UPS office, etc..

Cowen", "ReviewID": "R1LMRS6B2XU09K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Samsung makes great TV's that surpass every other manufacturer in their class.  I have this TV as well as another Samsung in my house and I can tell you the image is beautiful.  Now add in that this TV can directly connect to the internet and I'm sold.  TV's of this class have never been cheaper.One thing that I have found with TV's that its very important to actually look at the TV in person.  Now when you look at the TV's, go to a place like Walmart to see them, because many times specialty stores like Best Buy play with the lighting controls on the TV and in the store to skew the image to there advantage.  Once you look at the TV simply look and decide which one looks better to you.The next step is features:This Samsung comes with Auto Volume which automatically adjusts the volume of the desired channel, lowering the sound output when the modulation signal is high or raising the sound output when the modulation signal is low. This reduces the difference in volume when changing channels. The Auto Volume feature can be set to Normal, Night or Off.As far as outputs most of these TV's will come with more than enough Inputs and Outputs.  This TV comes with3x HDMI Audio/Video In, 1x Ethernet LAN In/Out, 1x RCA Component Audio/Video In amd 1x Digital CoaxialAudio Out.Next thing is in box technology:With this Smart HDTV there is a  full web browser with WiFi built-in apps made for TV.  Some of the apps this TV features is Hulu Plus, YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, and Twitter.

Needed one for another room & wanted Netflix / Amazon built in, so I got the smart version this time. Same beautiful picture. I also got the HW350 Samsung Audio Bar and scoured the internet for any documentation about ARC, which is needed to have full control of the SoundBar with the TV remote.As another owner stated in a comment, yes, it does have ARC on HDMI2, even though it is not marked or well documented. The sound on this set is pretty thin, and this inexpensive soundbar does make a huge difference, and is exactly the same width as the 32\"er so it looks nice below it.So once you've got it connected by HDMI-ARC the next point of frustration is that the Soundbar will turn Off simulaneously with the set, but it doesn't turn back On with the TV remote's power button. There's a lot on the internet about this. Here's how you can turn it on with the remote:Hit \"Tools\"Hit \"Anynet+\"Hit \"AV Receiver\"Switch it to \"On\" and the Soundbar will turn on. (Note that when you set up Anynet+ from Menu you need to enable AV Receiver control.)So bottom line is you *can* pair this with the HW350 Soundbar, connect it via HDMI-ARC (on HDMI2 of the TV), and control On, Off, and Volume using only the 5300 Series remote.Hope this saves someone else a few hours of research :-)", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "How to make your smart hub connect to the internet", "Author": "Jessica D.", "ReviewID": "R11K3UY93OP1XM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK, yesterday I would have given this 2 stars, but afters hours of googling on WHY my smart hub is not working it had a really simple fix.

This was one of the first smart TVs to have built-in wifi.  Samsung's products are usually at least decent, so we decided to go for this smart TV.  We bought it when it was first released and paid the hefty sum of $520 (it's now going for $328 on Amazon at the time of this review).  I have never been so disappointed with a purchase as I am with this TV.Samsung's smart TV software (Smart Hub) is incredibly buggy!  At first, the software would not remember our wifi password.  Every time we would turn on Smart Hub to watch Netflix, we would have to re-enter the network information.  Many times, we would re-enter the info, only to have the TV fail the mandatory network test.  All other devices in the house were properly connecting to wifi, just not this TV.  Turn off the TV and try again, you suggest?  Still wouldn't work.  There were many nights we turned the TV off in frustration after 20-30 minutes of fiddling with settings.After reading some of the other Amazon reviews, I took the advice of other reviewers and updated the Smart Hub software from Samsung's website.  The update process was simple enough.  I had hoped this would end my troubles with this TV.  It did not.  The TV remembers our wifi information now, but Netflix shows an error every time it is started, saying the app needs to be reinstalled.  After reinstalling the Netflix app, most videos get stuck at about the 30% mark when loading.  After about 5 minutes of looking at a stalled load screen, there is an error along the lines of, \"We are having trouble playing this title right now.\"  Sometimes going back, trying to load another video (with the same loading issues), and then going back to the original video you wanted to watch will result in a successful play.  Other times not.I use Netflix on the Playstation 3, on my Android phone, and on the computer.  Netflix starts and plays video just fine on all of them.  The lowest common denominator is always this \"smart\" TV.  If I had waited 6 months, I could have gotten a traditional TV for hundreds less and a Chromecast for $35.  Then we would be able to watch Netflix without all the hassles of dealing with this dumb TV.  I would have saved money and my nerves.  However, I am stuck with a $500 paper weight.I could probably get $100 for this TV on Craigslist, but that would be cruel to the buyer.  I'm thinking it will be much more satisfying to take this damn thing out into the desert with my 12 gauge and go \"Office Space\" on it.

I see a lot of people just rating it out of the box and you shouldn't do that. You need to mess with the settings and get the best out of this thing. So, I did just that and the picture was even better. Right now I just have analog television (well digital TV if you want to call it, no cable/satellite) and the quality is a bit ... blurry (not the TV's fault). But I expect movies from DVD's and whatnot to be better but that's another story (WHICH I HAVE UPDATED BELOW).The audio - out the box, it sucks. You need to mess with the settings again. Put it to stereo and some other settings I can't remember right now. I remember I could barely hear the audio even when it was on high. When I changed the settings, then it started to get more surround sound and more clear. There's A LOT of settings when coming to the audio, so that's a good thing. Right now it sounds like a movie theater in my house.The apps - There is a lot of bloatware. I don't know if I can delete some apps or not, I haven't tried. But for now there are some useless apps that I don't think I'd ever use. Amazon, Youtube, and Netflix works great. Also this is dependent on your internet connection. If you have a good connection, especially wired (I have wireless though), you should be fine. There were times where it froze for a few seconds, but that's because I was trying to do too much. This is like a computer and if you try to run too many things on a computer, that freezes too. So just be cautious.Web browser - Works but you need a wireless mouse and keyboard or else this is tedious.Regarding GLARE in bright environments - Well I live in a sunny place and I have sunlight coming in from the left side of the TV. So far I don't see a problem. Nothing is reflecting off of it. But I mean if the sun was right AT IT, I'd expect it to reflect. I don't think this screen is glossy, it's matte. Everything is fine on my side. Despite light coming from the side, it doesn't effect the picture quality or anything. I'm just speaking from a side view though.Summary :Picture - Mess with the settings to get the best out of this. Out of the box that isn't what it should be, because it doesn't look that great until you mess with it. I love Film/Warm 2 settings personally. But there's a setting for everyone.Audio - You DEFINITELY need to mess with the audio settings. It sounded so quiet with not a lot of bass at all until I tuned it up and now it's like a movie theater in my house.Apps - They work fine. Just don't try to do too many things at once or else there will be glitches, similar to computer freezes but it doesn't last long.Also for 400 bucks this is a great deal. I'm kind of bummed I bought this when it was 419, now it's 397! But before it was 442. Basically 2 weeks ago this TV was 442 and now it's 397. Just in time for black friday I guess.UPDATE 11/27/13 - Okay I messed with the settings and since I don't even have cable, I don't have a good stable connection for TV and because of that, it's blurry BUT NOT BECAUSE OF THE TV. I started to watch movies (Amazon prime HD) and they are AMAZING!!!!!I put the mode to Film, and the Picture Quality to Warm 2, It's like BluRay lite without actual bluray. The quality is amazing on this. I was watching Thor and everything was perfect.I saw someone on here say how Dynamic with high contrast and all that was the best and in my experience IT ISN'T. It burns my eyes. I love the subtle Film/Warm 2 look in my opinion. There is a \"Cool\" picture option but it makes everything too blue but when you get the settings you can mix it up, and there's A LOT of settings.I LOVE THIS TV!!!!!!

I purchased this in combination with a Samsung WiFi Blu-ray Player.  The TV automatically went into the set-up wizard and was extremely easy to follow.The screen with all the icons panicked me at first, but it is extremely easy to maneuver through.  We have old fashioned (yet digital) antenna TV (yes, I know.... shocking it still exists), but the set-up found and locked in all the channels that the signal picks up - I didn't have to do a thing.  I set up my Netflix and Pandora accounts with ease and was thrilled that I can use my WiFi Blue-ray on other TV's and still download movies in my room since the TV has WiFi as well.Netflix streaming is flawless.  Super fast and no glitches.  I can easily switch from Netflix to DVD's to TV.  I have not played around with all the other options and icons on the TV, so I am unable to comment on the \"SmartHub\" part of the TV.The Picture quality is brilliant. This TV is located in a small room, so the 32\" looks as gorgeous as the 50\" does in the living room.  I currently do not have external speakers or a stereo hooked up and I am more than pleased with the sound coming right from the TV speakers.  Surround sound I'm sure would greatly improve the experience if you are watching action movies - but hey, we still have antenna's, what do you expect here....The quality WAY exceeds my expectations based on the price -- so I have to go big on the value of this purchase.

I would have had to take it to a place about 20 miles away from my house.  I finally have had enough of trying to debug Samsung TV issues.  I returned both of the 5300's that exhibited the exact same issues.  Hooray for Amazon return policies and ease of sending back defect products.SHAME ON SAMSUNG!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 4/8/12:  Samsung service blamed my electrical in my house for ALL my issues (although they have never been here.) House is less than two years old, All other Samsung TVs that I have plugged in have NO issues (three other total).  I took the TV to another person's house and sure enough the same issues occurred.  So I guess If I call Samsung back the issue will be with the power delivery in a large metro area (I am sure customer service will continue to say there is no way this could be a Samsung issue.)Terrible TV and bad customer service for this issue!!!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 4/6/12:  New issue seen, after the TV had been on for awhile maybe an hour, not sure if it had turned off/on or not as I had walked in and out of the room a few times; however, I couldn't do anything with the TV it was frozen and I couldn't even turn it off.  Had to unplug the unit to get it to reset and allow it to be turned off.It appears to me as if these TV have huge issues that need resolved before they will be ready to be used (i.e. I am seeing that others are having mutliple issues with different versions of the EH/ES TVs.)  I saw a similar shut off issue being stated on an ES6500.  I hope that a software update will fix these issues; however, I might have re-turned this Second TV with all the same issues by then.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------update:  Others have seen the shutoff issue as well.  there is a theory that it is related to ECO settings; however, the shut off should then only occur every 4 hours... But I turned off all eco friendly features and will see if the shutoff issue continues.________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________The TV is in HOME mode, in reference to the \"user\" error comment (this is not) as well that Samsung support can't determine the cause either...The TV picture is very nice and what you would expect for a lower priced LED TV.

Web pages have slightly better usability than the D series with a standard remote, not good, but qwerty keyboard comes up vs. using a phone style text entering.  This makes the process faster but still brutal.Cons:1.  The Web brower doesn't support Flash; however, I thought Samsung was supporting flash on these TVs. (bummer)2.

This is the worst product I've ever purchased in 31 years of consumerism. It's not broken. It's just an absolute piece of junk, and the designers/developers should be ashamed of themselves.I've been meaning to write this review for a long time, but today I just happened to be sick in bed...the perfect situation to enjoy my new SMART TV. Too bad it's the dumbest product possible and I've barely watched a thing in 4 hours. I'm fed up! I've had so many problems with it that writing this review is more fun than trying to get it to work correctly.Where do I begin? It barely loads the smart hub because it's way under-powered. The built-in wifi connects often enough to know that my signal is good, but it loses connection just often enough to call it unreliable. Of course there is no wifi status symbol anywhere, which is ridiculous since that's standard for every other wifi device on the market.Simple barriers to watching TV happen almost daily. When they happen, I find that restarting it works about 2/3 of the time, but often it'll get stuck in this unresponsive on/off loop where I have no idea if it's on or off. The annoying little \"Power is Off\" LED really gets my green goat. Why would they put a power-sucking LED on the thing to tell me it's OFF? Whomever thought of that should be beaten with a shoe, that's so stupid.When the smart hub finally does load, the epic number of bloat apps that come installed have to update. EVERY FREAKING TIME. Sometimes 3 or 4 times per day; something that I can't uninstall is updating. While I'm updating it tells me that I can watch TV from another source. Oh, really? Can I?I don't subscribe to cable because I'm not my parents, so I have a brand new accessory antennae installed. Of course this is useless because the Samsung Smart TV doesn't pick up any channels like all of our other TV's do. And forget having a channel scan function. It's nowhere to be found. I suppose I'll watch snow while I GUESS whether or not the update is complete. Yes, you heard right. There is a handy little update progress bar tucked into the upper-right corner when the updates begin, which is nice, but of course it disappears after a mere 3 seconds so you have to keep checking back in ever so often so see if updates are complete. It may not sound like much, but this stuff gets annoying really fast. Thanks, design team. You are amazing.Eventually the smart hub will log me in...yes, that's right: LOGS ME IN...to a mandatory online data-mining account of some type... I awkwardly fumble to navigate the chaos that is the remote / interface duo to find Netflix. When i say awkward...holy cow. It's horrifically un-customizable and looks like an off-band children's toy. It's truly an interface for the \"don't\" list, and the default sound it makes as I hit the up and down buttons...oh man. It pierces the soul. More on the crummy interface later.All I really wanted this thing for was Netflix, but after twelve unsuccessful loads, I finally cave and take the hubs advice to \"reinstall the Netflix app\". I navigate to the Samsung app store (which is basically a junk yard for storing countless redundant, buggy apps that you've never heard of and will never use) to find  Netflix at the tippy top. Of course when I click on the icon, I am greeted with a grayed-out \"uninstall\" button. Netflix comes packaged with the TV, so of course there are no admin privileges available. Great attention to detail, team: tell me to reinstall something then laugh in my face when I realize it's impossible. Guess I'll cross my fingers and continue trying to load it over and over.So I do. After fourteen tries (yes, I'm doing this as I type) it finally logs me in, but then Netflix tells me that it's having trouble playing my feature. None of them can be played...no idea whose fault that is, but it happens constantly on this TV and prettymuch never on any of  my PC's. It's worth mentioning that if I can get the Netflix app to actually work, anything high-res lags so bad it's unwatchable due to under-powered hardware.Sometimes when I'm fed up, I think...hey...maybe I'll give up on the movie and play around on the internet! Right. The built-in Samsung web browser renders everything just wrong enough to make browsing feel like a walk in the park with 4 broken limbs, and there are no external accessories available to allow the use of a normal mouse/keyboard (that I know of). You literally have to scroll using the remote and type in every letter, number, and symbol in by hand. Scrolling is skiing on rocks. Paired with random unresponsiveness and generally processor lag, typing in a basic search phrase is enough to make Rainbow Bright contemplate suicide. Stick to simple words like butt, boob, and bra and you'll be fine.Of course you'll have to surf with the lights on, because the backlit remote turns off after 4 seconds and it's so incredibly dim that my cat has trouble reading it. I guess they had to make up for that power off LED somehow.Should I keep going? How about the media server offerings! They're bad. Really, really bad.It has amazing plug and play support for Windows 7 Media Player, which seemed cool at first, but only if you want to control everything from the PC and have no playback control while watching a movie. No bathroom breaks without running upstairs first, sorry! Plus, who in their right mind uses Windows Media Player for anything?There is currently no NAS server support unless you have a bachelors degree in computer science + 5 years experience in kernal debugging. Samsung offers their own web-based client/server software to serve media from a shared drive, but there is no way to control it with the remote, it's laughably unstable, it takes forever to load, and it took me 3 days to get it working despite having a career in I.T. There are android apps available to perform basic remote control functions like navigation, volume, play, stop, etc, but they are all third party and few are compliant with Android Jelly Bean, which is by far the most popular version right now. I mean, how bad can you really drop a ball, Samsung?After days of back and forth trying out options, I did eventually get Serviio on Lubuntu to work fantastically as a media server, but how many consumers know linux?! And, despite my perfectly organized media folders, the TV still insists upon using obnoxiously presumptuous folder categories for everything. I have to remember where my files are being automatically categorized every time I try to find something. Why not just let me use the folder trees I meticulously created on the PC? Worst of all, I know they never intended to support anything linux despite the TV utilizing a unix-based OS. Some kind soul had to design and support a basic linux server app at his own expense just to allow people to use the basic functions of their TV's. It's a slap in the face of software devs and consumers alike. Samsung should be paying this guy his weight in gold for his service to society.The sad thing is, there's more. So much more. I just can't think of it right now. Other than the complaints, it's just an  average consumer-grade TV. the picture isn't particularly great, the sound isn't particularly great, the remote isn't particularly great, or anything like that. I will say that pluggin a usb expansion drive or flash drive makes playing media very easy. If you want to copy/paste all your media to a drive and bring it to the TV then you'll be quite happy, but in the age of cloud computing, I don't consider that to be very \"smart\". The other positive thing is that it was really easy to put together and it is unbelievably light weight; perhaps all the feathers inside are keeping it from working correctly.Overall, this is the most poorly-designed, disappointing piece of hype I've ever experienced. The whole point is to forego the use of a separate hardware to watch hosted media, but this contraption just makes it more tedious. The samsung developers did bad and they should feel bad.What I'm really wondering is how could anyone be happy with this product? It outrages me that this is an Amazon best-seller. Who are these people and when did they forget that products are supposed to actually function? Imagine if your refrigerator stopped you to update every time you wanted to make a sandwich. What if your car just stopped in the middle of the highway 3 times a day?

That is, it doesn't fire up and talk directly to Netflix or Amazon.  It has to \"call home\" first to Samsung.  If that attempt to connect to Samsung fails for any reason, you get zero apps.We use this in an RV, so the wifi connectivity varies quite a bit.  When there is a connection problem, you're guaranteed a non-descriptive error.  Most people won't have this issue once it's up and working.It doesn't \"ask\" if you want to update.  It connects to Samsung and processes updates.  And it updates frequently.One surprise:I have a 1TB USB 3.0 drive that I have lots of media on.

Here are some things I think are outstanding about the Samsung.  I'll try to only talk about things that aren't mentioned constantly:1)  I dislike the overly contemporary look of most high-end Samsung TVs, and therefore don't usually consider them for purchase.  This, however, is a classic looking TV that won't look old next year and doesn't draw attention to itself at the expense of everything else.2)  Sony - and most other companies - no longer make a high end 32\" model, which is stupid.  My main TV is most likely to have a local computer nearby.  It's the kitchen and the bedroom where I need the SMART features most.  For that reason, this TV actually has very little competition.3)  USB ports.  These are outstanding, especially if your network is too slow for streaming (or if you don't have a port nearby and your wireless is slow).  Where my older Sony only plays some pictures off USB - and way too slow to actually want to use that feature, this newer Samsung can play almost all my media files locally or use a wireless mouse/keyboard.  I have one USB port filled with a Logitech receiver, which allows me to use a mouse and keyboard I have stashed under the bed.  Haven't actually bothered to use those yet (except for testing), but it's nice to know I could turn them up and use them without having to mess with any options.  In the other USB port, I have a micro-SD card reader about the same size that always has 32GB of TV series that I can watch in a pinch, say if they put on some reality crap instead of a decent show that I was expecting over the air.  Neither USB device can be seen except from the side.  It reads the files on the micro-SD card directly from the source menu and as quickly as Windows Explorer.4)  DLNA.  As much as I love that micro-SD card USB reader, you really don't even need it because the DLNA features are pretty mature.  The fact that it reads .mkv files so easily, and you can control integrated subtitles and audio tracks so easily is amazing.  My other TV requires transcoding for anything but MPEG, which really bogs down the processor on my laptop.  I really recommend Wild Media Server because it works so well with both this and my Sony, and can easily spit 720p to both TVs (different shows) simultaneously.  I couldn't get Serviio or Mezzmo to work as well.  Samsung apparently has some freeware available that you might want to try as well.All that said, despite the high contrast ratio, I don't feel like the picture is quite as good as my older Sony (which I believe only has a CR of 100,000:1), even after a lot of playing around.  As you'd expect from its small size, it does play SD (and lower) very nicely on its screen without pixelization (Comment for 32\" ONLY!).  Even so, I love this TV for the bedroom, and felt the price was reasonable.  It may get moved to replace the TV in the kitchen one day, and it will be great there, as well.Also, I would prefer a browser with adjustable transparency over the TV, as the PIP version has the sound and picture cutting out sometimes.  Even so, I would absolutely recommend this TV if you're looking for a 32\"er.Oh, but one more thing:  I just had some apps \"pushed\" on me, like the cell phone companies do to your smart phone.  If this continues, I'll be lowering my rating.  I did not buy a TV to have a bunch of useless crap sold to me.

Samsung makes good products, but it's tech support is one of the worst because they don't know anything. You'd expect them to be experts in Samsung products, but all they do is tell you to reinstall the driver. I had the same problem when I bought my Samsung laptop a couple of months ago - the bluetooth streaming didn't work right the first time. I eventually diagnosed the problem myself (just like I did tonight). I finally found out what the problem was - my media player (not firewall) was restricting streaming to other devices.", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best TV so far - Samsung UN46EH5300", "Author": "Debabrata", "ReviewID": "R252JVNJLUPXI8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used to be a big fan of Sony TV's including Sony Internet TVs. But after owning this TV - boy am I pleassantly surprised or what...this TV has everything except 3D - didn't need a 3D TV as 3D channels are hard to come by and personally I don't feel the thrill in playing 3D games with glasses ON - be it Active 3D or Passive 3D (Since 3D TV's are a misnomer and the actual effect is created by the software in the TV unlike in IMAX theatres where the 3D effect is created from the projector and the screen).Anyways, coming to back to the topic at hand - Samsung LED-LCD Smart HDTV have come a long way now in 2012. Samsung's SMART software is the dealbreaker in the market which has it all including AllShare which allows all format of files to be played including .MKVs, .AVIs, .WMVs, .MPGs, .VOBs, .FLVs etc and also plays videos, pictures from all kinds of input hardware like USB Flash Drive, HDMI and also wirelessly from the Windows/Mac laptops. This TV however has missed out on 16 Pin S-video input. Navigating the Web Browser is a bit of a sore with the Remote but with a wireless keyboard/mouse it works like a breeze. Apart from that the available apps have an awesome colection including default/in-built YouTube, NetFlix, Pandora, Amazon Instant Video, Hulu Plus - not to mention the Skype, Vudu HD Movies, Red Karaoke etc. The app collection is the best than any competitive Smart TV app collection including many free and paid downloadable apps.Moving onto the best part - the picture quality. This 1080p TV although may not boast of high motion frequency of above 120Hz (CMR) but the color depth and crispness is one of the best in the market comparable to any TV at any price point. This LED LCD TV is not Edge Lit instead it Back Lit with full array of LED and hence the color contrast really brings the HD shows to life with black levels which are as good as any Plasma TV without any clouding at edges. The only issue is picture formats have only 4 formats like Standard, Movie, Clear but has no Game setting.Next comes the sound quality...many other reviews have cribbed over the poor sound quality..but personally I have found them good though not good enough to blow you away as it is a bit Bass heavy. However, for my taste and requirements it meets my purpose but may be not for many - in that case would suggest an external sound system.To sum it up I have been using this TV for last 3 weeks with no issues at all. The only pain in the neck was setting up the TV on its stand. I personally would suggest a 46\" TV to be wall mounted rather than on a stand.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "First Samsung Television", "Author": "Marvin B.

I have tried different things to fix it:- resetting (and reinstalling) the smart hub countless times- deactivating and logging into netflix repeatedly- switching the TV country to the UK and other foreign countries (and back to the US again)- changing network settings on my router and modem..I've probably been spent a cumulative 10+ hours on the phone trying to fix this issue.

I have 6 different Samsung support transaction numbers, and I've talked to no less than 20 different Samsung employees.Samsung has told me the issue is:- a netflix server outage- a netflix application error- a netflix server update that is not compatible with the current version of the netflix app- a conflict on the netflix server because I access netflix on other Samsung devices from the same ISPNetflix has suggested that Samsung has over-produced SmartTVs and double issued the Netflix ESN numbers to different customers, causing the netflix servers to reject both TVs....As of today, I am waiting for a call back from the Executive Customer Relations department. I've asked to have Samsung replace this TV with a working model. Who knows where that will go, but I am sick and tired of having spent the extra money on a smart TV to not get a smart TV.

I'm sure there are some Hulu people out there somewhere in the world too.Well, the SmartHub, the software inside your TV that lets you download and use apps, like the netflix app, etc., has become increasingly buggy since I set up my TV.See ongoing discussion on C-Net: [...]More recent discussion on Uno Telly: [...]Problems:1. Constant updates. The TV demands that I reinstall or update the Smarthub software almost every time I turn the damn thing on. I don't have cable. I bought this TV for the sole purpose of using the Smarthub to stream content online. Every day when I get home from work and put my feet up to watch some House of Cards or something, I have to sit through a 10-minute update. Frequently, these updates reset the passwords on my streaming service account so I have to enter those again, using a TV remote mind you. Needless to say this is annoying after the 2nd or 3rd time, but it's infuriating when you have over 10 updates in less than a month.2. Netflix and Amazon Instant Video constantly unusable. Netflix works on my Android mobile device. It works on my roommate's Xbox. It works on my PC and it works on my laptop. I've never had a single error message on any of these devices in the 2 years I've been using Netflix. Not one. Guess what device Netflix almost never works on. My Samsung smart TV. The sole reason I bought this TV was to watch streaming content over Netflix, and I get an error message about 9 out of the 10 times I try to use it. Restarting the app or the smarthub usually does not work. Reinstalling them doesn't either. I've call Samsung customer service and their official stance is that this is Netflix's fault and Amazon's fault, and, amazingly, not a breach of warranty. I paid hundreds of dollars for a TV that's supposed to do one thing. It fails at that one thing. And it's not Samsung's fault. Amazing. I'm seriously considering a class action against Samsung for this BS product.3. Sound quality is poor. I have to blast the volume in order to understand what people are saying. I sit 9 feet from the screen. The words hit my ears with the clarity an AM radio station. I'm a 29 year old male so I don't think my hearing is fading yet, just generally mushy sound. I set the TV sound to \"clear dialogue\" mode which did absolutely nothing.I gave 2 stars because the picture quality is satisfactory.Don't buy a smart TV from Samsung.

So I was forced to go out and buy a TV quickly and without much research.  I purchased this Samsung model from a local Target store, along with their 3 year protection plan.For a few weeks the TV seemed to work ok.  The picture is no worse than most major brands but still not as good as Sony TVs. The sound quality seems fine.The issue is the functionality and reliabilty of the SmartHub feature.  I have the TV connected to the internet using an ethernet cable. I am not using the WiFi that is built in to the TV.Since getting this TV in October, it has had to update it's software at least once per week, sometimes more often, this process is not quick despite my internet connecting being well higher than is needed for media streaming.  Curiously, when I navigate to the Software Update section in the Menu, I get an error message that says \"This function is not available.\"  Really?About every 3rd time I turn it on and press the remote button to launch SmartHub, it crashes and will not start until I turn off the TV and turn it back on.About every 3rd time I try to launch Hulu or Amazon, the app itself crashes and I have to exit out of it and relaunch. Sometimes this does not fix it and the whole TV has to be turned off and back on.About every 10th time I try to launch SmartHub, it tells me there is no internet connection.  Yes there is. Every other internet device in the house is working just fine thank you.  Again, must turn off TV and back on, sometimes this doesn't work and I must actually unplug the TV wait a bit and plug it back in.At least 3 times since October, when launching Hulu or Amazon, a message pops up saying the clock is not set and needs to be set in order to use the SmartHub services. I go to the menu and to the clock setting to find it is actually set to the right time. The only way out of this loop is to change the time, exit, go back in and reset it to the correct time.As I type this I'm currently stuck in a new error message loop of \"No internet connection\" and \"Clock not set\" messages. No amount of relaunching, resetting, restarting, rebooting is working.  I am completely unable to launch any of the SmartHub apps at this time and after they try to launch for a few seconds the screen goes completely black. ... UPDATE: A few hours after first posting this review I was finally able to get SmartHub to launch but it took unplugging the power and ethernet several times.  Then today there's yet another SmartHub software update and now Amazon Prime will launch but Hulu will not.  Sigh...I should have spent the extra money on a new Sony... at least it may have lasted 3 years instead of 3 months.  It really ticks me off that the majority of Amazon Prime ready TVs are Samsung products, there are very few others to choose from and most of those are either giant 50+ inch screens or they are only available used or refurbished.After writing this review, I spoke with the manager of the store where I purchased the TV and the extended warrenty department.  The store will not help me.  It is 3 weeks past the 60 return period so they will not give me a refund or exchange.  The warrenty department said since the TV is within the first 12 months, they cannot help me either until the TV is one year old, then the extended warrenty will kick in.  I have no choice but to go through Samsung directly and based on the comments made by others on their experience dealing with Samsung I do not even think it's worth the time and stress.

It doesn't have any memory of what you used last, so now I have to select Netflix (apparently, my TV thinks I should exercise more because it always starts up on \"Fitness\")3. The Netflix and Amazon apps are painfully bad compared to a Roku. They're slow to load, the responsiveness is slow, and they randomly freeze up.4. The Smart Hub has updated itself about 10 times in the three weeks I've had the TV.5. There are about a dozen different apps taking up screen real estate for the sole purpose of selling you content, like Your Video, Fitness and Kids.6. Nothing is integrated. Every app has a different one-screen keyboard, none of them can make use of a USB keyboard (although the TV itself can for a few things). Every app has a completely different UI.If I hadn't given my Roku away with the CRT TV I replaced I would have just hooked it up.

TV. (I recently published: Simple Guide to Over-the-Air Free TV and had been encouraging him to do so for over a year.) Knowing that his 4 cable box habit couldn't be kicked with over-the-air TV alone, I suggested a smart TV from a favorite brand (Samsung) which has apps for Netflix (he is already a subscriber), Amazon (he just got Prime), Hulu Plus (suggested he give it a try to see if he likes it) and Vudu (for those seasons that he just can't do without). This smart TV at the 46\" size seemed like a stellar buy at fifty less than Black Friday prices, so they bought it and today I set it up for them (after a stop at the cable company to drop cable TV...) and showed them the ropes.After putting on the base (very easy to do, but the directions are poor) , connecting the power cable, a sound bar via optical audio cable, attaching a Mohu Leaf 50 Indoor HDTV Antenna for over-the-air network TV, and connecting a DVD player via HDMI, we fired it up. The start setup screen appeared immediately and was easy to follow. I chose 'automatic' for the time and progressed through to autoscan in the menu to capture over air channels (19 in HD for free...), and then to the Smart Hub.In the Smart Hub Netflix and a couple others appeared. The TV went through multiple updates after WiFi info for their home network was set and eventually it seemed the updates were done, and we were good to go to the Samsung Channel store (in the Smart Hub to the left) to add Hulu Plus and a few others. Each time an app was added, I could see how much internal memory was left to be used for app data, which was nice.I signed in and activated Amazon Instant Video without an issue. My parents were thrilled to be watching The HBO Collection immediately! I then attempted to sign them into Netflix and all I got was a black screen with 'connecting' and a wheel in the upper right hand portion of the screen. From experience I knew this was a software issue, but I really didn't want to reset the system to see if that fixed it so I went to the internet and did a search for 'Samsung Smart TV Netflix app issue'. After about 15 minutes I had several possible fixes, but I went with the easiest one first - and it worked!FIX: IF you cannot open the Netflix App on your Samsung Smart TV - reset the TV's time clock to 'manual' from automatic. It's in settings and easy to do, and once you do this, restart the TV and try the Netflix app again. It should work. Apparently Netflix's app has an issue with the automatic time clock but if you manually input it, all's well.Once that was fixed, there were no other issues. The picture is very good for a 60Hz LED, and uncompressed 1080i over air TV looks great! Colors would need adjusting out of the box for some, but for those who like vibrant reds and deep colors, the factory settings may be ideal. You can adjust so much in the Menu on this TV, you could take hours getting things 'just right'. I found small increments worked best for refinement.I also found a bunch of helpful videos on YouTube related to the Samsung smart TVs, which I directed my folks to check out at their leisure. The Samsung site has a downloadable PDF e-manual that is also found in Support in the TV's Menu. (I encouraged them to check that out as well.)  The PDF is easier to read and can be printed out if need be, which I like.I really like the apps that are available on this TV, and using a wireless connection at 60Mbps allows for no buffering using Wifi. There's a port for a wired connection, which undoubtedly would be that much more stable.  The internet browser is a nice feature, but tough to navigate with the remote, so I bought a Logitech K400 that works well with the system.HD content looks great, color adjustments are easy, and the refresh rate of 60Hz is very good for movies and every day network programming. Looking at the set straight on gives the best viewing experience, but it was very good at up to a 45 degree viewing angle at about 10'-12' away. Opening apps can be somewhat sluggish, but the apps seem to work as they are supposed to if they open initially.My parents (who are in their 70's) are very happy with the picture on this TV, but the sound was initially a bit disappointing. They did appreciate the addition of a sound bar, which when combined with Sound settings for Movie - were great for most of their viewing. They also appreciated the apps for Netflix, Amazon and Hulu Plus all being on the TV, as well as the access to the web browser and Android apps available for their Samsung Galaxy S4's.Overall, this was a solid purchase due to the screen size, purchase price and the smart TV features. It was frustrating to not have Netflix work out of the box though, and as I'm sure not everyone jumps into troubleshooting tech issues as I do, this may leave some people very frustrated with this TV and lead them to have to contact Samsung support.Ease of use is a big issue, and the lack of quick launch buttons for apps on the remote, app software issues that need addressing, and the so-so sound, some novice users may be happier with a 'dumb' budget TV like the RCA LED46C45RQ 46-Inch LED-Lit 1080p 60Hz TV (Black) and a Roku HD Streaming Player - Manufacturer Refurbished for the same price.FYI... No YouTube app, but you can use the web browser to play YouTube videos.NOTE: I could not get the Logitech Wireless Touch Keyboard K400 with Built-In Multi-Touch Touchpad to work with this this TV.

Caldwell", "ReviewID": "R1J8S840ZJNCHH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV with a little skepticism because I realize that it is in the budget arena as far as Smart TVs go, but here are my thoughts. In short, I am extremely pleased. I am writing based on the 46\", which is the model that I purchased.Form: TV is 9\" deep with the stand, without the stand, probably less than 3. I was surprised how slim this TV was for being a back-lit LED. Bezel around the edges is as pictured, very slim.Function: TV boots to cable/coaxial input, which I am not using because we only use streaming services at this time. The smart tv interface is pretty intuitive and easy to use. It is not quick when performing certain functions, but if you can live with that, everything works very well. Keep in mind what you paid for it. The remote is basic and quite frankly typing in your account information for Netflix or searching for a show is painful when using the arrows and selecting each letter. They should really have a qwerty remote for Samsung like some other brands have, especially for a smart TV. Wireless keyboard and mouse support is available through the usb ports, but my keyboard does not work in the netflix app, just FYI. I have not tried a mouse.Features: I am not using the HDMI at the moment, but I am sure they are fine. I found that one of the USB ports did not recognize my keyboard, though the other one did. I am not sure if this is intentional or not.Picture: Here is where the TV shines. The picture is magnificent. I have not compared it to a 3k dollar OLED or anything, but I bought this TV with the intention of having a nice, properly sized TV in our living room so we could actually watch our shows together in the living room instead of separately on our computers.Side note: Clearmotion 120 that Samsung advertises is just marketing bs, this TV is a 60hz refresh rate and that is what I wanted. Neither of us can stand the soap opera effect of 120hz and above, so I bought a 60hz intentionally and I have no complaints. Everything looks the way it \"should\", and not overly smooth like you will get with a higher refresh rate.Final thoughts: I am very happy with this purchase. It was in my price range, has a lot of features to get you started, and the picture is wonderful. I will probably buy a roku 3 to replace the built in Smart TV functions since the built in system is very budget oriented and can be slow at times, but it does work and is fulfilling my needs at this time.Thanks for reading.", "Date": "November 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Picture with Tweaking, Great Value", "Author": "CFH Review", "ReviewID": "R3CPE13VCF7HXH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Our 32and 26 Samsung LCD's had the capacitor failure Samsung is paying to fix. The 26 was fine but the 32 main board had a blown resistor as well. Samsung will only fix the capacitors and not anything that may happen to the LCD due to cascade failure! Anyhow the price to fix the 32 was close to $300! So for a bit more we bought the 40 with Smart TV.We had tried the better Samsung 40 LED with 3D and faster processor in the past but found the picture with the faster processing to be fake looking and would turn that feature off. The 3D worked but we felt it would be best for a larger TV and will consider it when we replace our Pioneer Elite 60 Plasma. Hopefully not for a long time Just Love that TV and wish Pioneer had stayed in the game.As many reviewers have stated; and it is the case with most slim LEC/LED's with the speakers in the back; the sound can be low at times. We have adjusted the settings for clear voice. It seems that conversation is the first to be effected and the sound can be too low to hear. We always have the remote in the ready to turn the volume up and rewind to hear what we missed. Sure you could turn the volume up; and we have; but it becomes too loud.It took a bit but I finally got the screen / color settings to our liking. Our set had a push to the red side and flesh tone was off most of the time. Even now it will shift from time to time. One second the flesh tone will seem fine and the next it looks like everyone has a tan or slight sun burn. Not sure if this is due to the background colors present. Another item is the off screen angle doesn't seem to be as good as the higher level sets. Colors and settings are a personal choice and some might light the all the settings on and the picture really bright. I prefer the subtle approach and will turn most settings down. If you turn on the Black enhancement features to full you will crush you your shadows and details. I found there to be enough settings to make the adjustments that were needed. Also this is a 60Hz set with 1080p. Don't let the 60Hz scare you or be fooled into needed the 240Hz. The picture is great and as stated before we found the higher speed sets to look fake. Almost like watching a live play.The Smart TV works great for us. We have it connected via a hard connection and are not using the wireless. Having the wireless is a Great feature but a hard connection is always best if you can. The update has added Amazon Prime to the menu which is something we were looking for. We were using our PS3 to connect to Amazon Prime and now only use the Samsung to do so. Amazon Prime has quit a bit of children programing and my son loves Thomas the Train.The remote has all the functions you will need and lights up! It also controls our PS3 if we watch a Blu Ray!The downside. This TV doesn't have a swivel stand! Out 32 Samsung did and we need this feature so everyone can see the set. Also with the weaker off angle on this set it is needed to direct to the screen to the viewing area. This is mainly need for us because we have the TV in the corner. If you had the set straight it would be fine. We bought this TV Swivel at Amazon that works great - B009UDTUNGA minor but weak area is the cable retainer. It does not stick to the stand! The stand has a small area that is not flat to attach the retainer to but the double sided tape to hold the cable retainer to the set keeps falling off. The cable retainer held firmly on one older 26 and 32 Samsungs.For the price it is the perfect set for our living room. We use the Pioneer for our home theater setup.

It wirelessly steams movies as if you're watching cable. The only problem I've noticed is occasionally YouTube will freeze. I blame my wireless service for this. There is a 'Contact Samsung' app on the settings screen but we haven't bother calling yet. It does have remote assistance that is covered under the manufactures warranty for a year.

Whatever signal you are using whether antenna, satellite, or cable you might need to make some minor color adjustments to fine tune picture quality.  You can navigate the menus with ease.

However, I have one issue that I think EVERYONE needs to be aware of before buying this product:On the box and all over the marketing for this product it says \"120 Clear Motion Rate\". I assumed that this meant the television was 120Hz. It is not. The refresh rate of this product is 60Hz. Samsung's stance is that there are three factors that go into the ability of a TV to display fast motion:1. the image processor2. the panel refresh rate (In Hz)3. The back-light technologySamsung factors all three of these together and brands this T.V. as 120 Clear Motion Rate. But again, this T.V. is 60Hz. I know it says in the amazon description that the T.V. is 120Hz, and I'm absolutely sure I'm reviewing the correct product. You will not get that ultra liquid smooth picture that you get from a true 120Hz T.V.However, I forgive Samsung for that bit of shady marketing because for a 60Hz T.V. this product is AMAZING. The picture is brilliant, colorful, sharp and on full brightness setting, I actually have to squint when staring straight at it. The smart TV apps work flawlessly and make this product function like a second computer.Also: There are 2 USB ports on the side. You can plug in a mouse and keyboard and they work instantly. With a mouse and keyboard this T.V.'s web browser makes a very capable computer substitute. I have not tried a wireless keyboard and mouse, but I suspect they would work just fine.The only criticism I have (besides the fact that I thought I was buying a 120Hz TV) is that the apps load a little slower that I'd like. It takes perhaps 10-15 seconds to load Netflix or Hulu. It sounds short, but that's a long time to stare at the screen watching the progress bar.The sound is adequate. It definitely fills the room, and the 3D-SRS sound does work well. But if you want theater quality sound with bass you can feel, you'll need a separate sound system.All in all, this product has exceeded my expectations in most ways and I would absolutely buy it again.", "Date": "March 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Black Dot", "Author": "D.

And so it was for the first 4 months.  However, it now has turned out to be another Big Deal in my life, something I neither expected nor needed.  Its operational problems pale in comparison with the systematic problems of the Samsung \"Support\" system.  They should rename it the \"Want More Misery?\" system, in the interest of honesty.Operationally, two months ago the set began on its own to power off and on, five minutes after the initial start-up.  Then five minutes after its restart, it displayed a message \"Smart Hub has successfully updated.\"  This process would sometimes repeat for two or three cycles.Actually, Smart Hub had ceased operation, despite the bogus \"successfully updated\" messages.  It wouldn't begin loading.  This meant I had no internet.  Not what I bought a \"smart\" television for.The TV required up to three attempts to turn it off.  It would restart itself two minutes after an attempt to turn it off.  This happened using a number of remote control devices, as well as using the manual button at the set's bottom rim.Using the at-home methods shown in the written manual, the e-manual, and the Samsung website to remedy these problems was not successful.I contacted Samsung \"Support\" via email, and was instructed to download the latest firmware version.  Should it fail to remedy the problems, I was informed I would get a technician to come to work on the set.  The latest firmware installation failed to remedy the problems. So I set about contacting Samsung in order to get a technician to come to my home and fix my television.I spent three hours yesterday doing the following: 1) I tried to contact Samsung \"Support\" again via e-mail using the code number assigned to my first contact with them, so as not to have to repeat the series of problems again.  This failed.  2) I tried to submit a request for service via the Samsung website.  After spending twenty minutes filling the form out, it failed to submit.  3) I registered the product with Samsung, expecting to be able to request service.  This failed after a successful registration.  4) I tried again to request service.  After filling the form out again, upon hitting \"Submit\" I was taken to another page for me to click on the problem areas to attempt a home remedy again (I think Samsung is using the \"Submit\" button on their website in place of a more accurate label, which would be \"Surrender\").  5) I clicked \"Chat\" and spent more than an hour \"Chatting\" with something which may well have been an artificial intelligence program meant to placate the complaints of human customers.  I ended up getting a repair order number, which entitles me to de-install and ship my television out of my home, to a distant repair facility, at my own expense.  Then, following an unknown amount of time, my TV will be sent via return shipping, possibly again at my own expense, to my home, there to be re-installed again.  And then, perhaps to repeat again the three failure modes current afflicting the television, or perhaps more, and then to begin again the process of getting Samsung to deal with the problems I had to pay them to provide for me in the form of this television.This isn't what I signed up for.

It's my first HD tv that I bought for myself so I am very satisfied.

I live in the city by a busy street and I find myself cranking the volume to hear movies.- no VGA input in back. That would be helpful for some devices that aren't brand new and come fully hdmi equipped.That's pretty much it.

I didn't even know my set had this feature (I rarely read through owners manuals - just \"plug & play\"). Was watching a DVD and the screen kept lightening and darkening within seconds over and over - this was at night with the room almost totally dark.  I turned off this feature.  2)  Streaming was frustrating until I increased my internet speed with our local provider. (I tried streaming Hulu and Amazon). 3) the Netflix app will not bring up your on-line queue and to go back, you have to exit the app (frustrating); 4) Even with a wired keyboard plugged in the USB, it is extremely frustrating to get the TV to \"recognize\" the keyboard. And the user manual is no use.Gave up on Hulu - it locks up within minutes - had to back out and restart only to have it lock up repeatedly.  Amazon Prime was better, but it still locks up after about 15-20 minutes.  You have to back out and re-start Amazon - a hassle, but it re-loads quickly.  Amazon also offers TV programs like Hulu, so it's a good trade-off. Surfing the web is pretty cool, but use a keyboard, ideally a wireless (there is a USB port).  Trying to use the remote to enter the router's PW was very frustrating.  Another reader suggested a Roku device but the reviews are dismal & Roku won't surf the web.

So, when you get this unit, be sure to use the system and wait for it to add in all the apps to access Netflix and Hulu and the like.Using the Browser on the TV to access the web is painfully slow!!!Connect your PC or Mac (I have successfully connect my Mac with the use of a \"Premium Mini DisplayPort to HDMI Adapter Cable with Audio Support - APPLE, MacBook, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, iMac, Mac mini, Mac Pro, and Xserve ---\" and \"BlueRigger HDMI Cable 50 feet - CL3 Rated for In-wall Installation\") to do any web surfing.

The problems i observed with this series of TV's are the same as experienced by other users and after few exchange of TV via samsung i observed that these issues are quality control related.....1. In first set i got dead pixels which were only visible from 6 to 10 inch of the screen, ofcourse no one watch from that closer but hey i paid for perfect condition brand new TV then why should i take one with defect. Best way to check dead pixel is to connect laptop, open browser in fullscreen by pressing F11 and then notice pixels closely throughout the screen by having background color as BLACK, WHITE, RED, BLUE and GREEN. reason of trying with all colors is sometimes these dead pixels only visible on specific color background2. After warrenty repair still dead pixels were there as instead of changing screen they replace the complete motherboard/circuit of the TV. No issues as i can again send it for repair under warranty :( and wait for 2 to 3 weeks to receive the repaired TV back with issue still exists. Don't lough its true'the repaired TV i got was now not having the dead pixel but one more defect.....Connect coaxial cable from your TV box to TV open any channel and go to the menu of TV under settings theres option called caption ON/OFF (Menu of the TV remote not the cable box) and then see the creen it will be filled with some special characters running on whole screen they looks like something which i can't even type but they are computer coding characters which won't allow you to have glimpse of picture you are intended to watch.one more defect :-( it was when you play Netflix it wont play any movie and keep displaying error message we are having trouble connecting please try again later untill you keep pressing OK button for at least 10 times.3. So here come's my replacement TV from Samsung with at least the dead pixel was not there as it was replacement not repair and also Netflix working fast (i compared using netflix on both TVs together in hand before returning older one) but still with Caption issue i told in step 2 above still existsAfter having so much trouble and wait time for TV and then headache to send TV by dropping to UPS as they don't do home repair for 32 inch TV, i decided to keep it with caption issue existing as it only happens while watching cable box and then too by using samsung TV's caption option. I can still use cable box caption option enable and watch everything perfectly.Overall this TV is best in its class in terms of features it provide, really cheap as compare to other brands,, Also Its the smart TV which support applications to watch VUDU or HULU or facebook etc. As i said in review heading TV is good if you are lucky enough to have one without these quality control related Samsung issues otherwise all the very best with Samsung warranty support.I went through this lengthy cycle/hassle as i just crossed the amazon return period before i discovered first issue in my TV and i ended up going through warranty.Samsung - If you are reading this, please improve your quality control methods before delivering the products to consumer. I know you are the largest LCD/LED panel manufacturer in the market and first in the market to introduce next generation panels for the TV. I also know dead pixels are common in TV's and most manufacturer even don't cover them under warranty until they are large enough in number to bother your watching experience. but I'll still suggest to have better customer feedback and quality product manufacturer brand in your bucket, you need to be little ahead in the mkt trends. why to deliver the panel to consumer if you know its faulty and just wait for the complain until customer discovers and if not then you saved small bucks as customer don't even know he has dead pixel.Buyers - Please check your screen Panel thoroughly within return period of Amazon to have screen without dead pixels. there are plenty of googled articles to explain how to check them easy enough.", "Date": "August 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fast Shipping, Great Product!", "Author": "Jason H.

Good Picture, Good Sound (as far as built-in speakers go).  Samsung is definitely in the top tier of display makers.  This replaced an older 32\" Samsung I'd had since 2005 (which was still 100% functional, but I wanted something bigger)One of the bigger selling points though is the \"Smart\" aspect.  And here...it's bad.  The idea is great.  I'd love not needing an external device to connect to Netflix, etc.  However, in the 6+ months I've had it, I don't think it's ever gone more than 3 days without requiring a software update.  The software updates go like this:- Press \"Smart Hub\" button.  You expect to be taken to the smart hub, but instead nothing happens for 5+ minutes.  You have to take it on faith that you actually pressed the button, because pressing it multiple times will freeze your television (requiring you to actually press the button on the television to turn it off; it won't accept remote signals anymore).- Assuming you were confident and patient, it *might* tell you it was updating.  If not, it's best to leave the TV on for an hour or so and try again to avoid the freezing issue above.- You may or may not get a progress bar on the update.  Sometimes it will update without one.- Once you are notified of the update, it may anywhere from 5 minutes to 5 hours to perform the update.  My internet is fast enough to stream 1080p video and play an online videogame with <40 ping simultaneously; I assume the slowdown is on Samsung's end...which sort of makes sense if they need to update the TV's software every 72 hrs. (I also have the TV hardwired to my router; I'm not relying on wireless)- Once the update is done, you will sometimes (maybe once/month) find that some of your programs are missing and need to be re-downloaded.- Even if they are not missing, you will almost always have to re-log into them, or re-sync them with whatever account it is associated with.  The Amazon ones are the biggest offenders; I seriously have to re-sync them every 2-3 days if I want to use them.  This is not very convenient.Even when everything is updated, streaming on the TV will frequently skip...requiring 30-40 seconds of buffering to play 5 seconds of video, and then requriing another half-minute+ of buffering...again, and again, again... A quick flip over to streaming from the PS3 to the TV shows it's not the internet connection as it streams just fine from my PS3.Bottom line: This is a great television as long as you ignore the \"smart\" aspect of it.

It is an extremely well priced tv in what I consider the mid-range. Amazon offers the absolute best-price on this tv compared to any local or online retailers.The television arrived packaged very well (a constant concern I have with these types of purchases).  removing the television from the box is straightforward.  There was absolutely no damage to the tv.  Instructions are straightforward as well.  Keep them, you will need to make adjustments as indicated below.  The design of the tv is typical of what you would expect from any similiar televsion with perhaps a notable exception of a joystick control located on the right side-underneath.  The build quality, despite the thinness and light weight, is very good. Unlike some tv's in this price range, the Samsung comes with 3 HDMI connections- not 2.  This could prove critical for some.  There are also 2 USB Ports (one powered), wi-fi, and mouse/keyboard support via USB.The display is great with rich and vibrant colors and deep blacks. The set operates at 60hz and is not an issue. Refresh was incredible with no artifacting, even after close to two years.  Out of th ebox, I use the settings recommended by \"Gordons\" review and produced an even better image.  They are:Mode: DynamicBacklight: 18Contrast: 85Brightness: 50Sharpness: 80Color: 70Tint: G/R 50/50I found these settings also minimized glare from windows due to the semi-gloss screen.Sound from this television leaves a lot to be desired as with any tv of this type. I was forced to get a Boston Acoustics soundbar to achieve my desired level and type of sound.  However, the television is located in a very large room with very high cathdral ceilings and a cat-walk that runs parallell.  Very demanding conditions.Connectivity with this televsion is great.  Amazon video on demand is flawless (there were a few TV software upgrades).  At one time, the software interface was clumsy.  That has changed.

I have the Inter net browser in the smart TV.  I just went to the Website for CBS from the TV and started the show just like I do it on the lap Top.WRONG!!  They somehow manage to always have a problem, it will play the commercial at the beginning and then reset the and default to the home screen.  Not enough Memory in the TV?  or?  they are just not going to let you stream stuff of the WEB.So,  I ordered some package's Hulu +  Netflix  and AMAZON for y pay to play movies.

They do what they can to make sure you pay for the content.I think its almost like smart phones,  they will practically give you the TV so they can sell you content.It going to be an interesting ride.EDIT,  I see a bunch of Dyslexia and spelling errors.I am not going to bother.If your not a technology person who spends a great deal of time on computers,do not waste the money on the newest Wifi smart TV's  Buy the 4 year old 50 Inch that is Not smart,  and a Roku or Smart WiFi Blue-ray player.

Slow, awkward to use, constantly updating, not customizable, ugly, unreliable).-No dedicated buttons for power/channel/volume/source (there is a multipurpose button/toggle though).Overall I am pleased with this TV because it works well as a TV. The picture quality is great, sound is decent, and it has a fair amount of inputs when compared to other TVs in the price range.

Wasted about 6 more hours over a month with Sam. Tech Support.  They sent me down all kinds of rabbit holes upgrading the firmware, etc., didn't want to send a serviceman.  They finally sent a serviceman.  I learned quite a few good things.1. The wifi talks to the main board, so when that is bad, tv will cycle off and on ... even if the wifi isn't hooked up, has never been used, etc.  2.  The wifi can break even if you're not using it, so don't buy a smart tv for anybody you don't live with that isn't a techie, and even that won't help much.  The only thing that will fix it is, a, replacing he wifi module, or b, removing the module if it's bad.  This will stop the on/off cycling. You have to remove the back.  Maybe YouTube has a video for it.  3. Don't believe them if you  call about wifi not working and they tell you to fix your firewall on your router, internet provider, etc., as long as your other wifi equipment works such as your laptop and Kindle there is no reason TV wifi shouldn't work.  4. The best picture size setting is screen fit.  Comcast users, if you're watching sports and the score is cut off on the edges, check your remote.  There is a HD Zoom button that is very easy to bump accidentally, so your TV is on a zoom setting forever until you push it again.  5. For closed captioning you have to set it up on your Comcast box:  Menu button > menu > setup > OK > subtitle setup > OK > subtitles > right arrow for on, left arrow later to turn off.I got a 2 yr warranty from Costco and glad I bought the 3 year extended Four Square warranty.  I'll probably need it.  Consumers Reports recommends not getting the smart TVs if you have a Blu-Ray player or other device toconnect to the internet.  Cheaper and easier to replace.  These smart TVs remind me of the TV stereo record player combos they sold way back.  Everybody had one and were thrilled until the TV died and they had this monstrosity in the LR with no place to put the new TV.  These smart TVs are poor now and will feel much worse as the other devices are improved while we're still stuck with the primitive features.I just bought a dumb Vizio for the bedroom.

Setup was easy and wireless worked fine for four months, then wireless crashed.  The TV also started rebooting itself, turning off after a few minutes when first starting with cold tv.  Called Samsung tech support, got the run-around, asked for a supervisor, got sent to an answering machine.  Left a phone number and they never called me back.  Called Costco concierge services and they told me they get this complaint all the time and she has a Samsung herself with the same problem.  They have a weak receiver in the TV for internet, and the best way to fix it is having a wifi booster or a direct connection.  Their software is buggy and they haven't been on the market that long.  Samsung denies they have a problem, that it's your problem, service provider, wireless firewall, etc., etc.  I'm not playing that game, so I reset the TV back to the way it came out of the box and it's working fine now as a \"dumb\" tv, the best kind, IMHO.  My IT pro friend says a dumb box is best and just hook up your own internet device to it.

Leard", "ReviewID": "R31DS5E3F15NP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In replacing an aging off-brand LCD TV, I was looking for a bump in quality and size both. I originally purchased a 32\" Samsung that I have also reviewed, but there was a bright spot in the corner and the sound was awful. I immediately sent it back to the retailer I purchased it from.A few weeks later I dipped my toe back in the Samsung waters. This TV won't blow anyone away, but it does a good job, the sound is serviceable (I'd still recommend a sound bar or speaker solution, but you don't HAVE to), and the lighting fairly uniform.The default color settings are reasonably solid, which was a nice surprise. Higher-contrast live-action viewing (like newer Food Network shows) is best served by \"Movie\"; it's not as crisp and colorful as I might prefer, and the black levels aren't ideal, almost looking like a filter has been placed on the TV, but it looks realistic, and bright colors still stand out. Most of the rest of what you'll watch, and especially cartoons, are greatly enhanced with normal, which really shows off what the set can do with color while also maintaining solid black levels.I don't intend to use the Samsung Smart TV features all that much, but I will be using HBO Go, Amazon VOD, and Netflix at least, and they work very well. Being able to operate without using a Roku or Apple TV is very nice, and the way it still displays the incoming video in a PIP field is pretty neat, too. Setting it up on my local wireless network was very easy, and wireless playback was generally smooth and high quality.The aforementioned 32\" TV also came with a dearth of inputs and outputs, and this TV remedies that with more options as to how I can plug in and what I can output.I did notice some banding on solid color screens. Nothing major, and I can't notice it 95% of the time, but when watching, say, an Apple product commercial, you'll probably pick it up. Research on this issue has led me to believe that this is \"business as usual\" for value TVs' the uniformity of the lighting array just isn't as gooas a more expensive unit, and you have to decide if you can live with that. Most of the time, however, the set works quite well, and at less than $700, it's a reasonable deal for a budget-minded purchase.

I used the tuning parameters found in another review for this TV to set up the picture and that works very well. For some reason the settings reverted to the default settings a few times and I had redo the settings several times. Finally, they \"took\". I restrict access to my home network by MAC address and this TV makes it very easy to determine the MAC address.This TV fits nicely in my TV cabinet, whereas my old 32\" LCD set fit in at an angle. The set is very responsive to the remote control from anyplace in the room. Not true with my last TV. The viewing angle is very good from anywhere in the room. The sound is not good, very weak and tinny, but I purchased a ZVOX 220 sound system that fits under the TV and solved that problem. I highly recommend the ZVOX 220 as a complement to this TV.I like the Smart TV feature. I have the same problem with YouTube that other folks mention, but I now access YouTube via the browser and that works fine. I use the browser a lot. To facilitate that, I purchased the Logitech K400 keyboard that works perfectly with this TV. I am a CSPAN junkie and the browser allowed me to ditch Comcast. Yay! I haven't used the other Smart TV options much, as the browser meets all of my needs, so far, and I access Amazon, Netflix, etc., via my Roku. It does potentially give me a backup option for accessing those sites, if my Roku dies. My initial impression is that the Roku is easier to use for these functions.I use a hard wired connection to my router, so can't comment on the wireless performance of the TV. I also use a hardwired Roku XS and that works very well, too.In the process of setting up an antenna to get OTA TV. My initial setup gave me a few channels and the TV works very well for OTA broadcasts.My only negative is the remote control. The layout is poor. The keys are so closely packed and similar in size that I have to look at the remote every time I use it. Good thing the keys light up briefly on it, or it would be completely unbearable. Worst remote control I have ever used.This is really too small a TV for 1080P resolution to be noticeable, at least I have found this to be true, so I tend to just watch programs in 720P which means I can purchase lower bandwidth Internet service. I have Netflix and Amazon Prime, so save a dollar every time I watch something using those services. They charge extra for HD, which is apparently 1080P. This also allows me to stay well within my monthly bandwidth allowance.Great TV. Highly recommended.UPDATE:After writing my review, I decided to return to tinkering with the Smart TV features and discovered something interesting. Image quality is much better when playing back programs on Amazon Prime and Netflix using Smart TV than when playing back via my Roku. Unfortunately, the Smart TV feature does not recognize my ZVOX 220, or any external speakers, so when using Smart TV, I get great image quality and crappy sound, and when playing via Roku I get middling image quality and great sound. Going to poke Samsung about this and may they can fix this in a software update...Upated update: 29 July 2013. My ZVOX mysteriously started working with the Smart TV.

The only reason that I didn't give this TV five stars is that the web browser installed on the TV does not support flash, which many online videos require. That wouldn't be so bad, but it is impossible to download Adobe Flash Player or a different web browser on the TV. So the only option to watch Flash videos is to buy a cord to stream your computer on the TV. This can be particularly tricky because the only ports on the TV are HDMI or USB. It would be helpful if the TV had a VGA port, since computers will often have this, but many computers don't have HDMI. If you want a TV that can stream Netfix, Hulu, or other sites like that, then this TV will be a great purchase for you. But if you watch a lot of videos that need flash, you definitely should see if your computer has an HDMI port before you buy this TV.Overall, this was a great purchase, and I got a great price on it during Black Friday week.

I love them both and decided to come back to this same brand to buy our main TV. I been browsing for an HDTV for our living room for a long time now and I always found that Samsung has the crispiest nicest colors from all the brands currently out there. While I looked up the suggested config of the picture settings, I ended up changing those.After reading the reviews I decided to go for this Smart TV, vs the regular TV, since I am subscribed to Hulu, Netflix and Prime. I am setting up our old TV in the kids room with the Roku we have. Setting up the apps are a breeze with the exception of Netflix. I made the mistake of setting the tv's internal clock to Automatic, which prevents the TV to link to Netflix. So when you set up the TV make sure to leave the clock on Manual mode if you will use Netflix.While this is not the TV's issue (though this is a 32 inch), but the design of the app, I found that browsing on Netflix and reading the minuscule text of movie summaries is pretty impossible, unless I am sitting right in front of the TV. Everyone in our family noted this same problem.The integration with Twitter and Facebook is simple but it is kind of nice that I can share updates and movies right from the tv. Having the PIP while browsing FB and TW is nice.I set up the Fitness app, unless I am missing something, unless I constantly log out and someone else logs in to the TV there is no other way to set up a second profile and switch easily between them. It has nice tracking features, though I did not start using it yet. Also nice that i can log into my Flickr account and set up a slideshow of my photos. I have not had a chance to test Family Story yet.I love the fact that I can plug in a keyboard and use that for typing in most username and passwords, searching as well as browsing. That is a huge plus in my opinion. :)There rest of the available apps are nice. I was especially happy to find the Digital Theater app to watch british theather performances.

This I confirmed by speaking with Samsung tech-support.  Such sites are almost always free and so Samsung like Sony with their PS3 will not permit consumers to access the free streaming of video on their devices.  This is wrong and consumers should complain.An example follows:Using my home computer I have been viewing free, live performances of opera and ballet from Europe on the internet.  Alas I cannot do this on my Samsung \"Smart\" TV via its internal internet connection.  Ths Samsung does not support the type of streamed video (mentioned above) provided by the European broadcasts.If I connect the video out from my home computer to the Samsung I have no problem since the computer is using the free streaming software to access the material and provide the video signal compatible with the Samsung or most stupid TVs.One such company, ParaClassics.com streams such free performances.

It was unab le to play any titles and said to try again later. I went through a month of calls to Samsung, called Netflix, called my ISP. I have chatted with support and done everything they said to try. Nothing worked to fix Netflix, it kept saying it was unable to play any titles right now, to try again later. Netflix support had me Deactivate and reactivate it and still no joy. Finally, Samsung sent a tech out and he had Support connect remotely and they determined my network was too slow. Which I knew was incorrect as nothing had changed with it and it worked fine for 9 months. My ISP was barely providing 3 Mbps download so I changed ISP and now get 30 Mbps download. I called Samsung back and tried to get a tech to come back out as I am convenience the Motherboard has failed after finding a Samsung forum where a Samsung tech stated he replaced the motherboard and it fixed this problem. I called Samsung numerous times and they argued and argued and I have a computer hardware background as well as Cisco certification CCNA and CCNA Security. I know about hardware and this could be fixed in warranty but Samsung refuses to own up and perform the repair. So I advised -DO NOT BUY THIS TV FOR NETFLIX.  After 6 weeks of chats, calls, the executive team saying the TV is fine I went and bought a second one, same model. It plays Netflix FINE, as it has updated chips on its motherboard and it has an updated Firmware version that is not available to the public at this time. I had to argue and insist they repair the TV so they finally sent out a USB device that was to have the 1039 version of the firmware - it didn't. After waiting two weeks for a USB drive ( ever heard of FTP Samsung?) they USB had the same version of firmware that doesn't work - 1037. So I call and argue some more and get placed on hold, disconnected twice and now they say I get to wait two more weeks fior another USB drive with the right Firmware version. Last night the tech FINALLY admitted after 20 calls, chats and a home visit where they ALL DENIED an issue existed - FINALLY I am told - YES there is a Firmware issue right now with Netflix and Samsung WILL NOT REPAIR the TV as they say it is NOT broken. WHAT? It worked fine for 9 months and then failed to function properly and its not the TV that's broken? I know for a fact that replacing the motherboard would fix my faulty TV but Samsung has refused the repair under Warranty. They will however be glad to have a tech come out and replace the motherboard at my expense. Yes, I am expected to pay for a Warranty repair?!! A product that has Netflix as a partner is refusing to admit the product failure? Best Buy can't help me out as I did not get a warranty from them so I have a faulty TV and no Netflix so consumer beware. Samsung will not stand behind the Warranty on this TV if its related to faulty firmware. Color me very disappointed and NEVER but a Samsung product without purchasing Best Buys coverage as the Geek squad would have fixed this under warranty with no questions. The second TV I bought has a 5 yr warranty from Best Buy and they will come out and repair that one, no extra charge.UPDATE: 2/4 - After waiting another 10 days to get a USB drive with the updated firmware version 1039, I received the USB with the same version of the 1st USB - both were WRONG.

When I asked when this would be resolved, she stated that buffering was likely a problem I would always encounter during peak viewing hours.  Geez, thanks Samsung.  I guess I'll just set my alarm clock and start watching Netflix at 3am so I won't overload your server.Additionally, the SmartHub is constantly updating.

We were looking for a TV for our bedroom and didn't want one too large so the 32 inch size seemed like a good choice. Knowing how virtually all of the newer equipment wants an internet connection and in view of the fact that I didn't have an Ethernet cable run to our bedroom, I knew I would want the built-in Wi-fi feature which this one has. Also I liked the idea of a built-in internet browser that would permit access to the internet without any other equipment being needed. I also wanted the 1080P HDTV and liked the idea of the LED feature. All told this TV had all of the features I wanted in the right size for our room.When the TV came in I was excited to start setting up the TV and getting it all hooked up to the cable service and the internet. The stand was easy to assemble and required 8 screws (supplied) and a Phillips head screwdriver (not supplied). We have a wireless network in our house and the TV found the network and when I entered the password it connected and immediately wanted to update its software which, of course, I permitted it to do. After that was done I set up our Netflix account and got that working too. The only thing I couldn't find was Amazon streaming and I was disappointed about that.One of the things that pleased me about the TV was the quality of the built-in speakers; they sound just fine for most purposes and simplify life for my wife who doesn't like to push buttons and change things around. The TV permitted the direct attachment of a cable box using HDMI and a Pioneer Universal Player using the component inputs. I've used both now and the picture quality is excellent on both and I have absolutely no complaints. I've connected the audio out to external speakers so if I want to get really big dramatic sound I can play back the TV through my new Audioengine A5+ speakers.

This is a very good 32\" HDTV. The picture quality is excellent. The sound quality is also very good.One complaint I have about this TV is that the base stand is very light weight. Previous Samsung TVs I have owned have had much heavier stands. This one is very light and when you touch the TV it will actually jiggle a little back and forth like it's on a spring.I'm also a little worried that if it is nudged too hard it could easily fall over due to the light weight base. Also, my other 32\" Samsung (model LN32B550) had a swivel stand that was quite nice, whereas this stand does not swivel, which is a bit disappointing.I assume Samsung decided to cut costs and the quality of the stand has suffered pretty dramatically from just 3 years ago. Other than the cheap stand issues, I am very pleased with this TV.Update (8/3/13): Since purchasing this TV, I have used it extensively with both Netflix and Amazon Prime and it has worked very well with both.

I first ordered the TV from a local retailer because it was listed as \"in stock\", but that wasn't true. In the end I decided to avoid the hassle of driving all over town and standing in line, and after clicking one button, Amazon had this TV sitting safely on my doorstep in two days, even though it was right before Christmas. Thanks Amazon- you rule!!I had the TV setup quickly and we were thrilled with the big beautiful picture, and even more excited to see what it seemed to be able to do in terms of streaming Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube, and media from our in-house PCs. It was pretty obvious how one should set these things up, and it went petty quickly. From there things started to go downhill. I'll omit all the details, but let me just say that the \"Smart TV\" part of this is the buggiest piece of crap I gave EVER encountered. I'm a career electrical engineer in the networking space, and if I was ever responsible for having developed something like this, I would be blackballed for the rest of my life.Youtube doesn't work, at all. Netflix is GREAT, when it works, but count on having to spend 30 minutes reloading the app, power cycling the TV, etc. to get your movie to play just as you're sitting down to enjoy your first date night in two weeks.All of the apps for this TV fed by the Samsung servers, and for several weeks they were either completely down or flakey. Customer support is nonexistent. Repeated software updates will give you hope just before they crash and break your heart.My recommendation: if you're looking for a basic TV with a decent picture and ths price makes sense, this is an OK dumb TV. if you want multimedia or streaming content, invest in a dedicated multimedia PC or the rock-solid Roku3. Forget about the \"Smart TV\" apps.

It still works by the screen started to show vertical lines and noises.  Finally decide to spend $600 and get this SmartTV by Samsung.  I can say that I am extremely happy with the TV.  However, I am unable to give this 5 starts for a few reason.First are a few pros.  The TV is very easy to setup and it is quite heavy for its size.  The TV stand is strong and compact to hold its weight.  It comes with 3 HDMI ports, and a few USB ports.  There is a PC port and regular analog port.  I attached Xbox 1 to the TV and it worked flawlessly.  I tried to play Blue Ray movie on my XBox 1 and only HDMI 1 allows the move to play.The remote that came with the TV works fine but trying to navigate and type on the SmartTV is futile at best.  I suggest that you get a USB keyboard (about $35) and it works well with the TV.If you have a Samsung smartphone, you will enjoy the way the phone interact with the TV.  You can easily share photos and videos from your Samsung smartphone by beaming it to the TV.  My family love this feature.Now, on to the negatives.  On initial boot up, Samsung requires updates on the SmartHub.  That takes a while if you use wireless network.  Once all the updates are done everything works fine.  One of the thing I noticed about SmartTV is the internal memory is quite small.  You cannot install a lot of apps on the TV.Another negative is using the internet to watch web videos will work for the first 10 minutes until the internal memory is full and the internet app will shut down.  I also tried using the Vevo app.  The SmartTV can play the app videos for the first 20 minutes until the videos start to stutter.

The text never looked as thin, crisp and sharp as on a regular monitor, so if you intend to use it as a monitor also, you may want to take a second look.I had planned to use it 50% as a monitor. After tinkering several days with the setting (changing the source name to PC, lowering the sharpness and brightness and also running high-end calibration tools), there was appreciable improvement but after I compared to a real monitor I realized that it can never come close to a real monitor. No matter what I did, the text will always be a little jagged, faded or fuzzy, regardless.For Windows the text smoothing was passable but on MacBook Air it was decidedly worse. If you are to use it as desktop monitor occasionally, less than 20% of the time, as a multi-media monitor in your living room, or for occasional browsing, then it may just be fine but otherwise as a full time desktop monitor it is not just good enough. You will mess up your eyes. After a while it will seem stupid to work on it, especially if the idea in the first place of having a big monitor was to improve clarity.Also, from my MacBook Air, I routinely ran into Sleep/wakeup issues.

We got a top of the line Netgear wireless dual band extender (WN2500RP), and it showed a great signal right beside the TV. Yet the TV couldn't even detect the extended network or the main network.

I did have problems with a Microsoft USB keyboard, but it was a gaming KB, so there may have been driver issues.  Haven't tried a mouse yet.  The included browser is terrible to try to use with the included remote.I have been disappointed with integration with my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone--I expected better control over the TV with a remote app, and I haven't really played with Allshare yet, mostly because I don't want to stream content from my phone, just use it as a remote, and I have yet to find any decent app in the Android store.Bottom line, it's a solid TV, especially for the price, with \"good enough\" smart features, though the UI is lacking.

I had absolutely no trouble linking it to my Wi-Fi network. Sure it's a tad slower than my main computer, but that's got a much faster processor and way more RAM. Some people complained about Amazon Prime problems with streaming media--that has been fixed. No problem. All the other apps that I have tried work very well. My problem is that I am on wireless and have a 5GB cap. I load movies at free wi-fi and put them on USB as a work around. I use a Logitech K-400 wireless keyboard, and it works fine. One person asked if the virtual keyboard can be disabled. I have not been able to do that either. It seems to only way you can use the K-400 is when the virtual keyboard is also displayed.

As usual I glanced at the \"what other people bought after viewing this item\" section which led me to tvs, and then from there I found this particular TV and it was on sale at the time for an excellent price, and BAM came the impulse buy just as amazon intended by showing that section LOL.I was shocked at how light it is and that I could carry the box upstairs by myself. It was easy to set up and the picture is gorgeous. I'm enjoying being able to stream video from netflix, amazon, and several other apps. I was able to easily connect both my DVR and my region free dvd player within seconds. The sound is a little tinny, not as rich and full and I had hoped.The smart hub is a little glitchy and will not always open when I want it to. Sometimes it just says \"starting\" but then disappears without opening. If I leave it alone and come back to it an hour or so later it works fine. I don't know why this is and  I have contacted the \"free tech support\" that I am supposed to have for 30 days but not gotten a response.

I wouldn't recommend ditching your computer or phone for browsing however:  the link-or-text methods for surfing are clunky at best.  The You Tube link to a Samsung smart phone takes some diddling, but it is workable.  As more of my viewing time shifts away from standard broadcast TV, it's a technology worth the time it takes to get used to.The Samsung Link feature is something else that has escaped my mastery.  The TV sees my phone and computers, however I've yet to be able to access videos, photos or music stored on them.  There is a help line that is accessible if you call during off hours and I'm hoping they can tune me up for that.Overall, it is a tidy package that fits neatly into the confined space that i put it.

First of all, it weighs practically nothing.  It is replacing a 2006 32\" Sharp Aquos flat tv that weighs at least 40 lbs!  This Samsung weighs about 12 lbs.  It made putting it up on the mount very, very easy for me.  When installing it, I ran into a strange problem that was easily fixed...I needed to enter the code for my wireless internet, and it had dashes in it and there are no dashes on the onscreen keyboard provided, but while waiting for someone at Samsung to figure it out, I did!  I remembered seeing USB ports, grabbed a real keyboard that uses USB ports, plugged it in, and viola!  I could enter the complete code for my internet!The real wow-moment was when I got it hooked up (very quickly) to my Dish Network DVR.  OMG, what an amazing and gorgeous screen!!!!  It made my 720p Sharp Aquos look like garbage by comparison!  I was lucky that the day I got it hooked up, the Syfy Channel ran all the Star Trek movies in full HD and it made me appreciate those movies all over again.  It was hard to look away!The Smart TV is impressive too.  I'm coming from a Roku, which has now been put in my son's room.  I can continue watching whatever I've got going on the TV until I settle in on whatever app I'm using.  It's a  simple 2 step system that keeps me watching TV until I've found what I want through the apps.  But with Roku, you leave the TV program, switch whatever system you are in to go to the Roku, search through a ton of stuff to find what you want, and there is no You Tube in it.  But there IS You Tube in the Smart TV apps, and it's great!  I subscribe to some public access channels and can keep myself laughing for hours watching some of them.  And I'm an Amazon Prime member, and I love having that access.  It works beautifully!  And a  lot more easily too.I received this TV the 3rd week of September and the TV is listed as being made on 8/31/13!  So it was fresh off the manufacturing line and there were very few updates at all as it was installed.I signed up my TV online and was given an additional 3 months of warranty for a total of 15 mos. warranty.Everything about this set has impressed me so very much.  I have one small thing that bothers me, and that is the sleep timer.  When my Aquos had its sleep timer turned on, it stayed on.  But for the sleep timer to work on this TV, it has to be turned on each and every time.  I simply forget.  It needs to be set so when it's on, it stays on until it is turned off.  That would  be a software update, I guess.  And if that is my only problem,  I feel like I've got a really amazing product!Overall, I totally love this TV!

The problems i observed with this series of TV's are the same as experienced by other users and after few exchange of TV via samsung i observed that these issues are quality control related.....1. In first set i got dead pixels which were only visible from 6 to 10 inch of the screen, ofcourse no one watch from that closer but hey i paid for perfect condition brand new TV then why should i take one with defect. Best way to check dead pixel is to connect laptop, open browser in fullscreen by pressing F11 and then notice pixels closely throughout the screen by having background color as BLACK, WHITE, RED, BLUE and GREEN. reason of trying with all colors is sometimes these dead pixels only visible on specific color background2. After warrenty repair still dead pixels were there as instead of changing screen they replace the complete motherboard/circuit of the TV. No issues as i can again send it for repair under warranty :( and wait for 2 to 3 weeks to receive the repaired TV back with issue still exists. Don't lough its true'the repaired TV i got was now not having the dead pixel but one more defect.....Connect coaxial cable from your TV box to TV open any channel and go to the menu of TV under settings theres option called caption ON/OFF (Menu of the TV remote not the cable box) and then see the creen it will be filled with some special characters running on whole screen they looks like something which i can't even type but they are computer coding characters which won't allow you to have glimpse of picture you are intended to watch.one more defect :-( it was when you play Netflix it wont play any movie and keep displaying error message we are having trouble connecting please try again later untill you keep pressing OK button for at least 10 times.3. So here come's my replacement TV from Samsung with at least the dead pixel was not there as it was replacement not repair and also Netflix working fast (i compared using netflix on both TVs together in hand before returning older one) but still with Caption issue i told in step 2 above still existsAfter having so much trouble and wait time for TV and then headache to send TV by dropping to UPS as they don't do home repair for 32 inch TV, i decided to keep it with caption issue existing as it only happens while watching cable box and then too by using samsung TV's caption option. I can still use cable box caption option enable and watch everything perfectly.Overall this TV is best in its class in terms of features it provide, really cheap as compare to other brands,, Also Its the smart TV which support applications to watch VUDU or HULU or facebook etc. As i said in review heading TV is good if you are lucky enough to have one without these quality control related Samsung issues otherwise all the very best with Samsung warranty support.I went through this lengthy cycle/hassle as i just crossed the amazon return period before i discovered first issue in my TV and i ended up going through warranty.Samsung - If you are reading this, please improve your quality control methods before delivering the products to consumer. I know you are the largest LCD/LED panel manufacturer in the market and first in the market to introduce next generation panels for the TV. I also know dead pixels are common in TV's and most manufacturer even don't cover them under warranty until they are large enough in number to bother your watching experience. but I'll still suggest to have better customer feedback and quality product manufacturer brand in your bucket, you need to be little ahead in the mkt trends. why to deliver the panel to consumer if you know its faulty and just wait for the complain until customer discovers and if not then you saved small bucks as customer don't even know he has dead pixel.Buyers - Please check your screen Panel thoroughly within return period of Amazon to have screen without dead pixels. there are plenty of googled articles to explain how to check them easy enough.", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price", "Author": "Brian P Henry", "ReviewID": "R12UZAF9JGCP98", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great picture quality, good sound, software probably the best of whats out there (Amazon Prime, Netflix; much better than similar software from Sony, etc).", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "Max", "ReviewID": "R1XSQKUB2EP0JI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was everything that I wanted.

Like others reviewers have said, the picture out of the box is terrible but easily fixable with  tweaking the settings and some patience.  The Smart TV features with built in Wi-Fi are worth the slight increased price over the exact base model, also this one has a few additional USB and HDMI ports than the next step down.My one downside has nothing really to do with the TV exactly, but more with the change from Samsung AllShare of Samsung Link (sharing app for watching files across Samsung devices).  This app is also responsible for playing files from a HDD.  This has been a crap shoot for me.  My WD 1TB HDD works perfectly fine on my larger Samsung TV with older firmware, detects the drive and plays away.  This model will see the HDD, but will just sit on the Samsung Link screen with \"loading\" displayed forever.  I first thought it was a size issue (even though 1TB is rather small these days), but I plugged in a Seagate 3TB drive and it loaded instantly and allowed streaming from the drive.  No rhyme or reason for the difference.  Samsung Link also doesn't stream per se, rather makes files available to other devices and makes you download them (unless I'm using it wrong but this is how it behaves on my GS III phone, input is welcome if someone know differently).  Thankfully I kept an old installer for the AllShare app to continue streaming between all my Samsung devices.The rest of the Smart TV features are awesome as expected, Netflix, Amazon, YouTube and all the other staple apps are included and easy to configure.I'm typically not a brand loyal person, but this model is replacing a 32\" LG LCD TV that had issues from day one (cheap panels in those folks, you've been warned) and I couldn't be happier with Samsung overall.

After I installed the Samsung TV; I noticed that the colors looked washed and really dimed. I read in the reviews that you need to re-calibrate the Samsung HDTV; because the stock settings are just really bad. For me; that I have the HP monitor just next to the Samsung HDTV it was super noticeable. So I started calibrating the Samsung HDTV with set ups that I found in reviews and sites. Neither of them came close to my HP monitor image quality. After checking different cables, softwares, set-ups, modes  and advanced settings for a whole afternoon I accomplished to get a set up that made the Samsung HDTV to look acceptable; However it is still far from the perfect image quality of the HP monitor. I compared my 3 year old 26\" LED VIZIO HDTV with the Samsung and I must tell you that the VIZIO looks great with the default settings. Samsung instead of putting all that crap of software in your \"SMART TV\" you should calibrate in factory your TVs; some people may not have a second TV or monitor to compare; hence they are stock with a really bad configuration.

The set-up with Time Warner's cable box was a bit cumbersome but that might be true with other TVs. The picture on cable was excellent but then I tried switching to Netflix and noticed a significant decrease in picture quality. Thinking that this might simply be a function of less resolution on an Internet connection I tried hooking up my \"old\" Roku XD box (which has a max resolution of 720) and noticed that the same Netflix program looked somewhat sharper than through the set's built-in wifi. The fact that the built-in wifi performs worse (or at least no better than) a two-year old Roku gave me pause to reconsider the wisdom of my purchase The picture degradation may be a function of having Netflix routed through Samsung's servers rather than through a direct connection to Netflix. I'm not enough of a techie to comment on the details here, but I know what I see and what I see doesn't impress me at all. In addition, the apps screen came clogged with various Samsung-sponsored programs in which I have zero interest. I don't want these things much less have them pre-installed on my set and forced to look at them every time I go to Netflix or Hulu. Maybe Samsung thinks that it's \"smart\" to herd customers into their proprietary offerings.

It just arrived yesterday and I got it set up last night.The packaging it arrived in was done very well and offered alot of protection for the TV which I was very happy to see (double boxed with a cool packing material I hadnt seen before, really nice).I have looked at the other reviews and I saw some that had me all worried before my TV arrived, they talked about how the version affects the panel you get and some have really bad angle viewing, etc.  The version code on mine didn't match any of the ones they mentioned (mine is showing UF03); let me cover the pros and cons that I see so far:Pros:Excellent side viewing, I put my head at the side of the TV so I could barely see the screen at all and there was no image blurring or fading that I could see at all.TV was fairly light and was easy to set up, has a nice automatic setup feature it walks you through, network setup and everything, was very quick and simple.Image is bright and very crisp, I am very pleased with this.The Smart TV stuff is pretty neat in my opinion (saw some people say it was clunky, etc), it seems very well done and polished overall.This TV automatically saw the media server I have on my network and I was able to stream movies from that to the TV very easily which was just awesome as I had expected that to be more complicated.The remote is much nicer than my old televisions was, laid out pretty nicely and has some unique colored buttons that make their function much easier to locate and use, overall its laid out pretty smartly.Neutral:  The sound from the TV itself is just ok but really not bad, better than my last TV thats for sure; dont really care as I use a home theatre setup anyway.Cons:  The screen is kinda glossy so it picks up reflections easily and I hate that, this is my biggest downer with the set so far. I really really hate glossy TV screens, very bad decision on Samsungs part in that regard.The stand is not very substantial and when the TV is mounted it has a slightly flimsy feel to it but not horrible.Thats really about it, overall an amazing TV I got for a killer price.

I am using Amazon's High Performance Indoor HDTV Antenna and get around 50 channels with a couple of duplicate channels and a few foreign language ones.The volume is okay, but that's not a big deal for me because I don't engage in serious viewing while in the bed.

I tend to trust amazon reviews, The reviews of this TV  are so great &  almost all reviewers thank Gordon (a gentle user with a magic potion that helped us to set the T.V right) so  I was inclined to buy it. I needed this T.V for a small media room to watch sports, action movies, explosions, people fighting, man stuff.Well I got the T.V and just opening the Box and connecting it to the source like too many have mentioned this TV does not win any awards. The native image like so many had commented in other reviews does not blow anybody's away that's  until you use Gordon's magical set up, that is a common theme for this set.So armed with Pen and paper and with lots of anticipation and like those Japanese cartoons I follow step by step Gordon's Magical recipe reciting the settings; Color 80!, contrast 70!, etc like so many others have done in the past.  I had so much faith on Gordon's set up that I had not doubt that the image will to come to life and finally blew me away.Well I have to say that I am still waiting for the image to come to life. Even after the tweaking the image to me looks flat, dull and lifeless. I have Verizon FIOS and while some channels come in 720p not 1080p the image on my other TV's are far better looking and vivid than the images on this T.V when comparing  same channels.(ok, ok,  just ESPN)My old Samsung Plasma TV looks much clear and the Vizio TV that we have in another room both had much more vivid images. I am not so sure if it is the 60 Hz refreshing speed (the standard nowadays seem to be 120 HZ) that is not fast enough to watch sports, high speed chases, people getting hurt in senseless action movies etc  but this TV does not seem to refresh as fast as you needed. People with dark skins look greenish, people with fair skins look purple...and by the way I am not watching Zombie movies.I thought in returning the set but I already had a mounting wall in place, paid for the mounting job etc  it is an annoyance to return the set and have to wait to buy another one.In a rebellious act of desperation I dared to change Gordon's magical settings with not better results to report, land of the dead with people looking like zombies, green and purple skins.I am not so sure if I had too great of an expectation based on the good reviews but for me this TV does not deserve more than three starts. Remember that I am just reporting my personal experience so please if you have a good experience good for you, I just want to help other possible buyers or to set expectations a little bit lower. that's the reason why we have reviews right?I am sorry Gordon....

Picture was blurry at first but quality become optimal when the input source name was to \"PC\". The difference between \"PC\" and \"PC-DVI\" is if you choose \"PC-DVI\" audio does not come through. In \"PC\" you can also use the TV speakers as audio output.Eco mode is turned on as default. It is a nice feature to increase and decrease brightness depending on the level of light and saves energy. However, it some low light levels, it can not decide which brightness level to stay with and goes back and forth between different levels of brightness. After a few hrs of working in the dusk and monitor going in and out of dimming frequently, I turned off the Eco mode and problem was fixed.There is auto turn off feature even though it is not described in manual. I could not find out about this until I started using it. It takes 15 minutes for the monitor to turn off after the PC goes to sleep or turn off. There is no option to adjust this time in settings that I can find. It turns off completely rather than goes to sleep. After it turns off, it will not wake up automatically when you turn the PC back on. You have to manually turn the monitor on. No big deal for me. Now I turn the monitor off when I turn the PC off.

Most of the formats are playable and it really makes it easy for a cluterless viewing.One problem I found is that over the time, the memory gets full after buffering when using app to watch videos. So after 1 month, now I'm experiencing issues - such as voice will go on mute if I reverse/forward/pause any video and then play again.App will close on it's own after some time (not always).

The colors are rich, and the blacks are deep. Out of the box, however, the picture is lacking and is less-than-appealing. You will need to tweak the settings before the set performs as it should. There are also several preset video modes, although they are not as good as creating your own settings. Experiment, and you will find that this set looks amazing when it has been set up properly.Audio \u2014The audio quality is lacking. This set seems to require a home theater system in order to experience sound properly. There are two extremes when using this set: either dialogue is much too loud and the action and music are audible but muffled; or the action and music are much too loud and the dialogue is drowned out. You might find a setting that you like, but I have yet to find one myself.Connectivity \u2014This set can connect to the internet wirelessly via Wi-Fi or through a wired ethernet connection. I use its connectivity to stream movies from my computer through my Xbox 360 to the set, and there is no noticeable drop in quality. There are three HDMI ports, although there is no S-Video port. There are also two USB ports, with one being labeled as being a \"hard drive\" port because it supplies extra power for external hard drives or Samsung HomeSync. The set is also capable of using a keyboard and a mouse, which makes surfing the internet a bit easier.Interface \u2014The overall interface is extremely clunky and inconsistent. It is also slow in that it seems to lag occasionally, especially if you press a button on the remote several times in a row. A lot of the screens seem to take an abnormally long time to load as well.Apps \u2014The apps are nice, although I have only used Netflix thus far (which was the main driving point in my purchase of this television). The set can connect to Facebook and twitter (allowing you to live-tweet what you are watching, although I am not sure why anyone would want to do that). It would be nice if there was a central location you could visit on your desktop to select what apps you want to download (or have on your set) that would then be downloaded (or deleted) by your set the next time you used it; alas, there is not, and going through the \"app store\" is extremely tedious, and the selection is lacking.Overall, this is an excellent set for the price. (As of this writing, it is listed by Amazon at almost half-off its list price.)", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "T.V. is public school smart", "Author": "Galin", "ReviewID": "R3IQMR310QEDX0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We chose this T.V. because it's \"smart\" and because it's a Samsung.  The picture is great and the stock audio isn't horrible.  I'm going to focus mostly on the smart part.TELEVISIONWe are unplugged...no cable or satellite.  We use Netflix and Hulu almost exclusively for our viewing needs.  Apparently this is completely unheard of in South Korea (where Samsung is made) because this T.V. insists on only booting up to the television signal which, for us, is static.  Not the best thing to see every time we turn on.  To make matters even better, the static window always appears on the \"Smart Hub\" which is the home screen for the apps as is seen on the picture of the T.V. here on Amazon.APPSThere is a decent selection of apps including Netflix and Hulu.  Mysteriously absent is a YouTube app.  There is a link/app but that just takes you to their website (see more on this below).  The thing I dislike is that on the Smart Hub, there are several unwanted apps plus 6 large app shortcuts that are totally irrelevant to what I want (Fitness, Kids, Media Hub, etc.)WEB BROWSINGWe made sure we got a T.V. with web browsing so we could watch shows on Spike, AMC, ABC, etc.  Well...remember the old WebTV back in the AOL days?  That probably provided better web browsing than this T.V. does.  The pages are not at all optimized for T.V. so the text is unreadable due to its small size.  There is an apparent lack of memory because almost every time I click a link on the home page that was installed at the factory, I get an error message that says it's out of memory and needs to close.  Unacceptable.  Navigation is impossible with the slow-to-respond remote arrows.  And forget about trying to type in a web address.  Supposedly you can set up a mouse and keyboard but this isn't my office, it's my bedroom.  With all of the smarts in the Galaxy phone, I can't see why there's not an apparent way to set up bookmarks on your phone or laptop that you can easily open on the T.V.  I say 'apparent' because....MENU SYSTEMThe menus are missing several obvious functions.  Not that they weren't necessarily thought of but they're simply greyed out.  Screen adjustment, System Setup, Menu Language, PIP on/off, e-Manual (and it didn't come with a paper one either?!?), Software Update and even Smart Hub are all greyed out and unavailable.  The lack of an e-Manual is just stunning to me.  I am confident that it very well could solve many of the issues I am having with the smart part of this T.V.  Frankly, I don't really want to spend hours upon hours tinkering around to find ways to save minutes upon minutes.  These things should be completely intuitive in a T.V. made by the top manufacturer in this day and age.SMART HUBAgain, this is the home base for the apps and what makes this T.V. smart.  In the product image you can see the water wallpaper.  It is one wallpaper out of a whopping two wallpapers.  The other one is black with grey lines on the bottom.  Way to go out on a limb there, Samsung.  What I really dislike about the Smart Hub though is its constant need to download updates.  In the week or so that we've had the T.V., it has stopped us to wait for it to do its thing twice not counting initial setup.  Not a huge investment of time or anything but I just want to watch some dang T.V., not sit around waiting for it to download more useless apps that I don't want and didn't ask for.  Further, Smart Hub itself also frequently updates which means you have to sit around and wait for it to do its thing.STREAMINGThis T.V. does do streaming extremely well.  The new Netflix app is amazing although, again, the text on the browsing page is way too small.  Unlike our old junky smart DVD player, this Netflix app will usually keep going when the signal slows down (we are maxed out at 5MB where we live) and has a slow frame rate for a few seconds.  I very much prefer this over the stop and go method.  Hulu, our other provider, doesn't do so well.  It quite often stops frequently even while Netflix is rip roaring.  This, of course, is not the T.V.'s fault but never the less is part of the experience.REMOTENice huge volume and power buttons.  Backlit buttons but unfortunately you have to find the back light button to light the buttons.  It's opposite the power button so it's a crap shoot which one you hit until you become very familiar with the remote.  Our living room T.V. remote lights up automatically when it's moved.  Take a cue on this one, Sammy.  Generally it's a decent remote though.SUMMARYExcellent picture at a good price.  The smart part is almost more of an annoyance than a convenience, particularly with the constant updates that don't add any value.  It is very nice having Wi-Fi built into the T.V. but unfortunately because of the negatives I would not recommend this T.V. to a friend.", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "smart with a glitch", "Author": "S.

But when trying to stream media from my computer all hell breaks loose.  Both oth Samsung's Allshare and Plex media server will not reliably show up on the connections.  I have to turn the TV on and off, or hit refresh, and things will sort of randomly appear.  Sometimes one of my two windows user accounts, sometimes both, my NAS drive, Plex and Samsung's own Allshare.  Annoying, but after a few tries I can usually get Plex or Allshare and when I select somtimes I can get to the point where I can star a movie this is where it gets wierd.- When I stream from the computer, after about 5-10 minutes the connection drops and I get an informative message, something like: \"you are disconnected\"  If I immediately select my player again it starts the film over again, like nothing was wrong.  This happens both on the Ethernet or WiFi.  The only way I can get it to work is if I setup the TV on my Ethernet and then for some reason disable my WiFI on my computer.  Don't ask me how I figured that one out.  I thought It might be a DHCP issue at first, but I'm more comfortable blaming the TV.I contacted Samsung's tech support several times and they never seemed to understand the issues.  They finally told me to ship my TV to them and they would have a look, but I never felt that they were documenting things properly.  I work in this field and I know how the tech support goons operate.  Give the nature of my issues which were largely intermittent, someone would likely be given my TV and a ticket that says \"Network Connection Problems\", hook it up to a network and turn youtube on for 30 seconds and send it back saying everything works fine now.

After some serious studying, I settled on this model to replace an aged Sharp Aquos CFL.  One of the most important features that I was looking for was adjustments.  I am very particular about my picture, and having a full array of adjustments to fine tune the picture is a must.  This model has ample means for fine adjustment, and paired with AVSHD calibration screens I was able to get it dialed right in.  The picture and contrast are impressive for this price point. Don't let the 60hz fool you, it is nice and smooth, even gaming. I also use a Samsung blue ray player, and the auto resolution and frame rate work very well together.  I don't use the built in speakers, so I can't really comment on the sound.  I have the TV mounted to the wall, but I did use the factory mount until it got here.  I was not too impressed with the factory base, but I know that it would probably work ok.  I just get nervous having such a large panel on such a flimsy base.  We live pretty far from town in the mountains, and use Dish and DishNet for our services.  I didn't really need a smart tv, as my limited download quota from satellite does not allow for much streaming.  But it seems to be intuitive, all be it slow. Don't expect computer browser speed, and seems to have limited RAM.  I bet Netflix and Pandora work well, but can't really say.  However,  pairing with our Samsung phones is very painless, and watching video/pictures from the phones is very easy and clear. Also, the USB port is super handy for Calibration, as you can download your calibration software, and run it right off the USB.

[(1) Stand Instructions did not include a step listed in the Set\u2019s Inst.s (2) The stand must be directly slid into the set; if not, the set leans backwards (3) Inst.s call for two people to move/erect the set]  Four small screws assemble the stand and four more attach it to the set.  It works but appears a little \u201ctippy\u201d front-to-back. (Inst.s include steps for connecting a separately purchased anchor; if you have small kids\u2026.)Connecting my satellite box was as easy as plugging in an HDMI cable (not included; purchased separately).  I could not get it to work, however, without a call to Samsung\u2019s support which explained the process for selecting it using the remote\u2019s \u201cSource\u201d key.  My DVD I connected with an AV cable I had but could not get it to work.  (Inst.s were not clear.) I defaulted and purchased another HDMI cable; problem solved.Turning on the set started initial set-up.  (I have a wireless router so internet connection was as easy as entering the password (which is not totally easy, you have to use an on-screen keyboard, moving the selector from key to key gets monotonous; also, some other screens time out if you take too much time). I did not find the Inst.s completely clear about the set-up.  You have to let the Samsung software download/update.I was pleased to find the set was then able to wirelessly connect to my computer (after I realized/learned I had to change a setting on the computer).  I can now review pictures stored on my computer.  My videos, though, bring up \u201cThe file you\u2019ve selected is not currently supported.\u201d (I\u2019ve not asked Samsung if/when that will change.)I was able to login (slowly, using the on-screen keyboard) to my Netflix account and play videos.  The second time I tried, I found I had to enter all the login info. again.  A call to Samsung support and I was told it is necessary to set up a Samsung account on the set before it would remember my logins. (A second review of the Inst.s does not find that.)  After setting up the acct. (on-screen keyboard again), the process is pressing the remote\u2019s button for Samsung\u2019s \u201cHub\u201d, moving the selector to the Netflix icon and selecting it.Samsung\u2019s support has been very good.  (Though one call had me in a queue for 8-10 minutes; right after the Dec. & New Year holidays that may be expected.)  That is a real help because the Instructions are basic.  They seem to assume a \u201csmart tv\u201d knowledge-level.  [I have 7 yrs. advanced education and have used computers since before the mouse but this is my first \u201csmart tv\u201d.]  I foresee more calls to support to make use of all the set\u2019s capabilities.

I only purchased the 40-inch for $397. Now it's doubled in price. whoa.Now that, that's said, it's a great TV. Once I got my settings right where I wanted them I was good to go.But I had to shut off it's screensaver...which it has strangely enough... otherwise I'd turn it on to find the blank, black screensaver on and no cable. I'd have to shut it back off and make sure the logo appeared when I turned it back on. Now that the screensaver is off it no longer stays on even after the TV's been turned off and back on again. Aside from that It's got great sound and picture quality! The apps are great also, but the browsing experience sucks. It's terrible!The remote control is not enough unless you change it to jump to links otherwise it's very slow going. Even spelling out an address took way too much time and effort. It's not like you're, say, clicking left and it's jumping from one letter to another...no...it's clicking left several times just to get the mouse to move. Yeah it's like that.If you get this TV for the browser, I'd suggest a wireless keyboard and mouse duo. They need to get the signal from the same USB otherwise they cancel each other out. How do I know this? Because I tried it with a Microsoft mouse and a Logitech keyboard. It was a no go as they are on different USB receivers. So I then grabbed my old duo mouse and keyboard from Logitech, both on the same receiver and they worked perfectly. So in the end, if you plan on browsing the web from the TV itself for those shows you can't find anywhere else except online... use a dual mouse and keyboard set.

Patterson \"Online shopper\"", "ReviewID": "R78BVI0HCBZKU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We ordered this TV during 2013 pre-Black Friday sales for $497, and haven't seen it cheaper!I was a little worried about going with a 60Hz instead of 120Hz, but we haven't noticed any problems when watching tv or movies.  After doing some research, we ended up with this model because we read that a 120Hz+ refresh rate doesn't add value unless you're using the TV to play video games.  We've watched a couple of HD NFL games, and there's absolutely no lag with the picture.As far as the Smart TV is concerned -- Samsung seems to offer one of the better Smart TV platforms.  So far we've streamed Amazon Prime videos and streamed videos from our home network (my husband's computer) with Samsung Link.  Samsung Link has some flaws, but we were able to figure it out.  It has a hard time loading videos and music from our network to the point the TV has restarted on us, but maybe that's because my husband added over 300 GB worth of material to the shared folders.  Our wireless router is also at the opposite end of our house and in the lower level, and we notice signal interference, so I think that has a lot to do with it., too.  It may be worth our while to invest in a new wireless router.If you're using an audio receiver, then the only option for audio out on this TV is an optical audio cable.Picture quality seems great, but it helps that we didn't compare this TV side-by-side in the stores.  I've read a few reviews where people manually changed picture settings and that dramatically increased picture color, etc. compared to the factory defaults.  We just haven't explored this yet.  My husband didn't like the energy saver mode, where the TV automatically dims and brightens based on the ambient lighting, but I didn't mind it.The TV arrived in a brown box, so it wasn't obviously a TV that was delivered to our house.  I appreciated that.  We also had to sign for the TV, so I'm glad we were home to receive it.  Set up was easy, and we mounted it to a tv stand.

We have the ASUS RT-N66U Dual-Band Wireless-N900 Gigabit Router hooked up to Comcast Cable via the ARRIS / Motorola SurfBoard SB6141 DOCSIS 3.0 Cable Modem and coupled to the Synology DiskStation 2-Bay (Diskless) Network Attached Storage (NAS) DS213. With this home network, we run multiple smartphones, tablets, computers, Apple TV, Roku, and a home entertainment server.The TV facilitates almost *all* of these devices (ok, not really the phones too much), seamlessly connecting to the NAS for movies and music (the music being usually accessed via the Apple TV) and to the internet directly. We regularly use Amazon Prime on the TV to watch movies, the connection to the NAS to watch movies we already have downloaded, and the facilitation of multiple streaming devices (Apple TV and Roku) for other random media.I have focused on the central role the TV plays in our home network entertainment system, but it would be remiss not to mention the fact that this TV has excellent picture quality as well. I have to say, I have probably not fully tested this aspect, as I have primarily watched streamed movies and somewhat less than HD-quality video files on our home network, so I am probably not in the best position to comment on just *how* superior the quality really is.I have to say that *some* of the apps are not all that. They're good, but for example, the Samsung Link app that I usually use to connect to the Video server on the NAS requires that you essentially enter a separate menu in order to significantly advance in a movie, rather than (for example) using the usual page advance button on the remote.

AnyNet+ is nice because I can change the input to my PlayStation 3 with the TV remote, and it will change the input on my Onkyo receiver and turn the PS3 on, and let me control the PS3 with the TV remote. This is important because the Netflix app on this TV is terrible, so I have to use my PS3. The Netflix app constantly deactivates, and I have to log in again. I don't have this problem on any other device. The SmartHub as a whole doesn't feel very polished. Sometimes when I turn the TV on, and then try to start the SmartHub, it will say that's it's updating and to try again later. It will also display this little progress bar, which would be handy, except it disappears and I can't bring it back to see when the update will be done.It's also kind of annoying that the TV seems to want to default to TV/CD on my receiver. It would be nice to be able to change the default, since nothing is actually hooked to TV/CD at the moment (because it's not an HDMI port), so I just see static.", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "A great handy-size TV", "Author": "Daniel Lufkin", "ReviewID": "R1GNWWY2LN1L6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This set replaces a 20-year-old, 200-lb, 19-inch CRT set that fit into a built-in cabinet.

This is my 3rd Samsung TV but first LED. I am thoroughly happy with my purchase.In the 5 years since I last purchased a TV, the technology has come such a long way! This TV is incredibly light and can be managed easily by 1 person. There are 8 screws to screw in to connect the pedestal. A minor complaint is that the base doesn't swivel, but it's light enough that the entire TV can be positioned at a different angle without much effort. A lot of attention went into the details, down to the low profile wall plug that has grip grooves. The bezel is very thin and almost non-existent. Best of all, the TV consumes very little energy. The sticker estimates $7/yr.The remote is well-designed and almost identical to my other Samsung remote. I do wish that the SmartTV button was bigger however as it's the one I use most. Also, the arrow buttons should've been made bigger and more prominent as that's the only way to navigate the menus. Setup was very easy and I didn't have any trouble at all connecting to my WiFi.The feature that I love the most is Amazon Prime. I had no problem getting it to work. After unboxing a TV or any device, I always update the firmware as soon as I'm connected to the internet. If you experience any issues, be sure to update the firmware. The TV shows a 4 digit code and all you have to do is go to Amazon's page to authorize the device. No login or password entry required on the TV. It took all of 2 minutes before I was watching a movie on my Prime membership. With the Smart TV, I don't need my Roku anymore. There are literally hundreds of apps and games you can download from the Google store so you are getting quite a lot of value from this unit. Some apps, for example, allow you to watch international content from Dish Networks and other cable providers (with a subscription).The web browser is also capable, although navigating with the remote control is a giant pain in the butt. I have a laptop and don't plan to use my TV for internet browsing, but recently my friends have taken to streaming in YouTube videos whenever we get together and this is a great way to enjoy internet content w/o having to hook up the laptop to the TV. Flash works, so no problems there. I tested a few video sites. I haven't tested with a mouse and keyboard to see if they work.All in all, I'm very happy with this TV and wholeheartedly recommend it to others.", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great picture.

I bought this Samsung through Amazon's refurbished/damaged store because it was much cheaper and the description said the only thing wrong with it was the packaging it came in. The TV arrived, though, and actually had a small crack in the back of the unit. Amazon ended up knocking off even more $$$ so I was VERY happy. The TV was easy to hook up and get the SmartHub set up (less than an hour). I was able to start downloading apps like Netflix, Hulu Plus, Spotify and BBC News right away. The picture is very clear when watching DVDs or streaming from Netflix or Hulu Plus (especially compared to streaming over the Wii on our other TV). My only complaint is the interface of SmartHub is kind of annoying and they force you to download updates pretty often. We did have an issue with it the other day where it just shut off and then wouldn't turn back on but it only happened that once and we haven't had any other issues with it.

I originally wanted a 42\" TV but could not find one in the $400 range that was from a reputable manufacturer. I also have a 55\" Samsung in the family room and have been very happy with the picture quality and performance of that TV. It also has built in WIFI for updates and apps which is an added bonus.SIZE:Since I have the TV wall mounted I wanted an LED tv to keep the bulk and weight down. Also since we would be viewing this from 10 feet away I wanted a screen that was big enough to see easily and 32\" was just a little to small. This 40\" screen is perfect for my application and comes in almost 10lbs lighter then the 32\" it replaced. Now although this is an LED tv, it is deeper then other LED models. It is my understanding that this has to do with the placement of the LED lights behind the screen opposed to on the sides of the screen. Not an issue for my application but others might want to take that into consideration.PICTURE:Out of the box the picture was terrible. You NEED to adjust the settings to get it looking great. Once you get things right it looks fantastic, truly stellar. The blacks are deep and dark, colors are vibrant and with an HD 1080 or 720 connection it is all you want a modern HD tv to look like, crisp and clear. Viewing it in a totally dark room I can say the blacks are truly black with very little if any light leak.SOUND:Surprisingly good sound quality for a flat screen. Not great by any means but better then others I've had. I found that setting the sound to enhance voices made a huge difference. The volume increments are very subtle. On my old TV level 10 was suitable at night to not wake my wife is she was sleeping. This TV you need to have on level 30 to hear clearly. 30 is actually not very loud on this unit, just mentally takes a little getting used to. There is also a noticeable nice bass tone to everything. Not room shaking or anything, but it's not the tin-ey tone I am used to on similar TV's. I'd say that compared to other TV's of this size and type that the sound quality is superior. For family room use you would probably want to get a sound bar or similar,especially if you have kids.APPS:*** UPDATE***After using the Netflix app more then expected I found one night that the Media Hub was reporting a network error upon loading. Although WIFI was working and I had a strong internet connection I could not launch Netflix, Hulu, Amazon etc. Some research online pointed out that in order to use any app the TV must first talk with Samsung's network servers. This sounds fine (although odd) however the servers have a tendency to fail often. When this happens you are unable to use most of the apps on the tv, particularly the streaming apps. Additionally the error message is very cryptic and suggests you check your WIFI and Internet connection (which I did several times), alas that wasn't the problem, it was Samsung's servers that were down. Keep this in mind if this will be your method of viewing online content. It completely ruined a planed Netflix night for me. Why you would need to \"check in\" with Samsung to use Netflix is beyond me, but it seems with this setup it is necessary. Because of this we will definitely be getting another AppleTV/Roku for the bedroom.One of the TV's selling point is Internet apps. I have experience with this on one of my blue ray players. I also have 2 Apple Tv devices. I can say the apps are excruciatingly slow to load. Moving between menus is painfully slow. To really take advantage of this you need some sort of keyboard as the remote is not the best interface when trying to type things in. I will give a few app reviews of the items that I would use the most.Netflix/Hulu:After setup which thankfully was quick, it works great. Shows take a little longer to load then on the AppleTV but acceptable. The interface for Netflix is lacking a lot, certainly not as robust as on the AppleTV but acceptable for my limited use (being this is in the bedroom). The picture quality was as great, no complaints.Web Browsing:Well, I didn't expect much. I have experience with seeing the web on tv and have never been impressed. This was slightly better then I expected, However.. Trying to surf the web using the remote was a painful frustrating experience. I wanted to pull up a few sites to see what it was like. The sites looked good, no issues there, just the interface is terrible. I don't blame Samsung for this, aside from including a keyboard there is not much they can do. This is the biggest issue with web surfing via TV. I think Samsung deserves credit for giving it a great effort but if your looking for a \"Web TV\" this is not it, and honestly I would recommend getting a tablet for that. There are some great tablets for under $200 (Google Nexus) that will give you a far better internet experience.Other Apps:There are apps for Twitter, Facebook and just about anything you can think of. Again, a TV is really not meant to be a computer replacement or even a tablet alternative. It's a great bonus feature that can come in handy but DO NOT buy this TV for those features thinking it will be amazing (in theory yes, reality no so much). You will be much happier (and save yourself lots of frustrating time) with a nice tablet.BUILD QUALITY:I must say, I love the looks of this TV. It has a very narrow bezel, surprisingly thin. There is no obnoxious labeling and the branding is subtle. There are no protruding buttons so when mounted on a wall it looks more like a picture frame then a TV. Very clean minimalist look. It is light weight (about 30lbs) and just looks fantastic. Plenty of ports on back and they are easy to read and use. Extremely happy about this. Pictures just don't do it justice, it's a beautiful unit. It comes with a very nice sturdy stand that requires a few screws to install (it comes with all the hardware for that).OVERALL:I am thrilled about this purchase. The size is perfect for my application. The picture quality is stellar and the sound is very good for built in speakers. The apps are a great add-on but I would not buy the TV for that. I do like that the TV is able to upgrade it's firmware via the internet, so any bug fixes or software upgrades are actually possible. I may buy another AppleTV for this unit just because of the interface and ability to stream from my iTunes library but that is a personal choice as Netflix and Hulu work great once you get them to load using the TV's Apps. Overall I highly recommend getting this TV for those who need a great 40\" screen.", "Date": "October 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "I'm happy with it.", "Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "R6SPER7YHL5JP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for 3 months now, for the most part I'm really happy with it.

I put movies on thumb drives and a external hard drives and it played them without a hitch either. The color look good to me.

The Smart TV isn't too smart and is very slow.  The home page has many fixed apps which cannot be removed.  I have had the set for two weeks and now the streaming frequently freezes.  The only way out of it is to exit the Smart TV interface and re-enter it with many remote control operations to get back to where you are.  Once this starts freezing it will keep freezing every few moments.  This is with a wired Ethernet connection on a gigabit lan.

After 6 months of use I started seeing lots of vertical lines on screen irrespective of what channel, program I was watching.

I contacted Samsung, told them about problem, they created a ticket and told me someone will contact me in 48 hrs. I waited patiently for 4 days and no calls from them. I reached out to them they said please wait for another couple of days and someone will call you. This time someone really called me after about a week or so, this guy asked me to send some details and photos of problem I was facing with my TV. I did that, post which he told me he has received the details, he will be ordering the parts to repair my TV and will get back to me in few days. I waited for quite some time to be precise a month, and when I inquired him when do he plan to come, no response. I then reached out to Samsung and to my dismay, they told me ticket has been closed as I did not send them TV for repair. That was some blatant lie as I still have text messages from this repair guy where he mentioned that he will call me once he receives the parts. Anyways they again created a ticket for my, it again took 2 weeks and multiple followups with them to finally find out who's in God's name will repair my TV. Now they are telling me to co-ordinate with this repair system to get it repaired. They also told me to pay for the Shipping cost to get it repaired.

I read all of the other reviews and was a bit hesitant on color and viewing angle but took the chance. Given the quality of my Samsung LCD I was confident in the brand.I have HD through DirecTV and the picture is excellent, if you don't have HD get it otherwise you will not get the best picture. I learned this the hard way on another set.Did a little playing around with the color settings as others suggested, this was very helpful and I tweaked it to my preferences. I found the auto light adjustment a annoying so I turned it off. Viewing at direct and side angles, no issues at all. Enough connections for HDMI but could have used 1 more component hookup as I still have an old DVD play and a WII, I'll need to get a BlueRay player at some point.Now for the smart features, after the inital load its works well. I use Amazon Prime and Netflix both work well. I have played with the youtube, I like the iPad/iPhone connection, its pretty cool. It is a little tedious entering text but is fine for my needs as  I don't plan on surfing the net on my TV. I have a dedicated line running to my router and have activated the wireless, both work well.Sound is the only disappointing feature on the TV itself. It works OK, not great. But seriously if you're purchasing a set like this I would expect that you would be connecting to a stereo or surround sound. If you just want a simple connection to a stereo you will need a 1/8 to RCA adapter to run the audio out. Cables I purchased one with the set along with an HDMI which plugged right into my DirecTv receiver.No issues with the set after 90 days. If something is going to go wrong it is usually in the first 30 so I didn't go for the warranty, although the square deal is much cheaper than those you purchased at retail.Finally don't worry about shipping. The set is securely packed by Samsung. Amazon adds another layer of a box and packing to keep it secure.

Luckily Samsung has their 1 year warranty and after talking to them and finally getting them to believe there was indeed an issue they got a local repair company to fix it.  Currently the TV is in the shop hopefully it'll come back soon.  The guy said this is common with these luckily it happened now, just curious when the new one will decide to do the same.........", "Date": "June 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Nice!", "Author": "Uhhhhhh", "ReviewID": "R22CQG522ZU03L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love almost everything about this TV!

I read the reviews on Amazon and agree with the general pros and cons:Pros:Great picture; sharp with true color.Easy set up.Good customer service, both phone and e-mail.Decent sound.Cons:When I couldn't find the apps, I called customer service.  Turned out that their servers were down.  The service rep told me to try again in a few hours.  Just a few minutes on hold and got the right answer.  Pretty good.  Apps were easy to install.When I couldn't stream from the web app, I wrote an e-mail and got a response in a day.  Streaming from the web app generally doesn't work.  The service rep told me that this problem is because Adobe doesn't support the flash player for the TV.  Seems lame for a \"smart\" TV.  Is the Samsung business plan to channel all streaming through the five standard services (Netflix, HuluPlus, etc.)?  I note that those apps cannot be deleted; others can.Since I can't stream any programs from the web browser, it's pretty much useless to me.  As many reviewers have noted, typing from the screen keyboard is painful.  Although I have a wireless keyboard, I haven't tried to hook it up since I won't be using the web app.Overall, this is a great TV in this price range.  I primarily use the \"smart\" part to stream from Netflix.  Although I stream Netflix from my laptop through through an HDMI to my dumb TV, the built-in feature is more convenient.  The cost differential to get the \"smarts\" is only around $50, which is worth the price.

The problems i observed with this series of TV's are the same as experienced by other users and after few exchange of TV via samsung i observed that these issues are quality control related.....1. In first set i got dead pixels which were only visible from 6 to 10 inch of the screen, ofcourse no one watch from that closer but hey i paid for perfect condition brand new TV then why should i take one with defect. Best way to check dead pixel is to connect laptop, open browser in fullscreen by pressing F11 and then notice pixels closely throughout the screen by having background color as BLACK, WHITE, RED, BLUE and GREEN. reason of trying with all colors is sometimes these dead pixels only visible on specific color background2. After warrenty repair still dead pixels were there as instead of changing screen they replace the complete motherboard/circuit of the TV. No issues as i can again send it for repair under warranty :( and wait for 2 to 3 weeks to receive the repaired TV back with issue still exists. Don't lough its true'the repaired TV i got was now not having the dead pixel but one more defect.....Connect coaxial cable from your TV box to TV open any channel and go to the menu of TV under settings theres option called caption ON/OFF (Menu of the TV remote not the cable box) and then see the creen it will be filled with some special characters running on whole screen they looks like something which i can't even type but they are computer coding characters which won't allow you to have glimpse of picture you are intended to watch.one more defect :-( it was when you play Netflix it wont play any movie and keep displaying error message we are having trouble connecting please try again later untill you keep pressing OK button for at least 10 times.3. So here come's my replacement TV from Samsung with at least the dead pixel was not there as it was replacement not repair and also Netflix working fast (i compared using netflix on both TVs together in hand before returning older one) but still with Caption issue i told in step 2 above still existsAfter having so much trouble and wait time for TV and then headache to send TV by dropping to UPS as they don't do home repair for 32 inch TV, i decided to keep it with caption issue existing as it only happens while watching cable box and then too by using samsung TV's caption option. I can still use cable box caption option enable and watch everything perfectly.Overall this TV is best in its class in terms of features it provide, really cheap as compare to other brands,, Also Its the smart TV which support applications to watch VUDU or HULU or facebook etc. As i said in review heading TV is good if you are lucky enough to have one without these quality control related Samsung issues otherwise all the very best with Samsung warranty support.I went through this lengthy cycle/hassle as i just crossed the amazon return period before i discovered first issue in my TV and i ended up going through warranty.Samsung - If you are reading this, please improve your quality control methods before delivering the products to consumer. I know you are the largest LCD/LED panel manufacturer in the market and first in the market to introduce next generation panels for the TV. I also know dead pixels are common in TV's and most manufacturer even don't cover them under warranty until they are large enough in number to bother your watching experience. but I'll still suggest to have better customer feedback and quality product manufacturer brand in your bucket, you need to be little ahead in the mkt trends. why to deliver the panel to consumer if you know its faulty and just wait for the complain until customer discovers and if not then you saved small bucks as customer don't even know he has dead pixel.Buyers - Please check your screen Panel thoroughly within return period of Amazon to have screen without dead pixels. there are plenty of googled articles to explain how to check them easy enough.", "Date": "May 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "great tv, great shipping, great price", "Author": "Martha L.

I tried a USB HDD but that didn't do too well but I believe that was because the external drive is old and doesn't work too well to begin with but it did come up to be used, occasionally. My Flash drive worked flawlessly.I have yet to try the internet connection because my router and other connections are too far away at this time but I\u2019ll get to it eventually when I can afford more equipment.

But I like to watch DVD movies that these days are mostly in wide-screen format and don't show up well on an old 27\" analog set. So I went looking for a 32\" LCD TV. After considering all the options and prices, combined with valuable reviews by users, I settled on this Samsung TV. I noticed that it referred to itself as being \"smart,\" but not knowing what that meant just wrote it off as marketing hype. After ordering the set I realized that it would be WiFi capable, and it intrigued me to realize that I was getting a built-in computer as well. Not that I needed that, but you never know...The set arrived promptly on the scheduled date. Setup was easy and after plugging in the power and connecting the cable it played just fine. The picture was maybe not as great as I had expected, but much better than my old set.Later that evening I set out to explore the new toy. I had already programmed the available channels (20-30 minutes) and started looking for the weather channel. It came back with an error message: scrambled channel. Huh? Most other channels did not work either.I called the WOW! Cable help people at 10 pm. I promptly got an assistant, but after trying all kinds of suggestions, nothing worked. Took 2 aspirins and called back in the morning. Same scenario, so I was scheduled for a visit by a technician. I was worried that the set had a bad tuner and would have to be returned, although Amazoin would have made that as easy as possible.The technician showed up on time and walked in the door with a plasticized card with cable numbers in his hand. He knew the problem before he arrived: changing from the old analog TV with a cable D/A converter to a direct cable connection resulted in different cable numbers! Problem solved. While he was there, the technician checked my connections and that was that.Now the picture quality was true digital HD and absolutely marvelous. Beyond my best expectations.So why the 4 stars? In short, because of the limited features of the remote control that make using the Internet features of the set a torture.After familiarizing myself with the set, I connected it to my old Netgear 802.11g type router. I had been using the older WEP security protocol - good enough for my purpose. Its problem is that it uses a long string of hexadecimal numbers, based on a pass phrase that the router understands, but none of the peripherals do, Entering all those letters and numbers from an on-screen keyboard, without errors, using the TV's remote control was torture. I finally got it to work. After touching the \"Smart\" button, a screen popped up with all sorts of Apps useful in the TV context, such as Netflix. Getting around on it with the minimal remote controls is painful. One helpful hint: you can connect a keyboard and mouse to USB ports that are hidden behind the right-hand rim of the screen, helpful with the Browser App.The set comes with the usual minimal printed manual, and refers you to the electronic e-manual for more instructions. It is helpful, if you can find what you need. It has an index that you access by pressing the 'D' function key on the remote. Than you can scroll through the alphabet and hope to find what you need. I finally downloaded the manual as a pdf from the support section of the Samsung Web site.In summary: great TV set, useful WiFi connectabiliy to download movies or so, but forget using the browser for email or such.", "Date": "April 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works Perfectly", "Author": "Heisenburg", "ReviewID": "R27CU5MR7C5EVN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have been using this TV since last 6 months.

I think I got them signed out now, but before returning anything to Amazon be sure you don't have any account info on it.

The initial Smart Hub/internet connection setup is quite easy, probably 15 minutes, you must navigate an on-screen keyboard using the remote control for the setup. The usual input is required: date, time, router password, etc. Connection speed thru the hub to establish a stable, wireless link is often slow, 10-20 seconds, not as fast as the typical laptop takes to log on to the internet. Once connected, streaming is quite good with our cable internet provider, maybe a few pauses during a full length movie. I think there can be multiple reasons for an intermittent wireless link, and wireless download speed can be quite variable depending on traffic, so I can't fault the TV for the pauses.

Make sure you get minimum 120 hz to avoid the motion blur.  The picture quality is fantastic to excellent.

I was afraid that there would be problems here, as my broadband dsl service is pretty slow, but the streaming video has worked great, no delays.  The only delays we've seen is youtube.  That's stop and go to the point of being unwatchable with some videos--the lower quality videos are fine, the higher quality videos are stop and go unwatchable.Just two cons:  1, At first, the tv would periodically dim and get really dark.  I read the troubleshooting, and found this was the Eco Sensor, the tv automatically adjusts to the lighting in the room.  It didn't seem to work too well, and got annoying.  I turned off the feature and now the picture is perfect 24/7.  2.  The other thing I would mention--it's too small for the main tv.

But so far we are very pleased with the purchase from Amazon.  We bought it a few weeks ago and it was delivered promptly.  We shopped around some and found Amazon to be the most competitive on pricing.  (For reasons that still baffle me, the price of this unit seemed to fluctuate rapidly between $399 and $499, even on Amazon and within the same day.  We were fortunate to pay $399, but of course it's lower still now.)The TV was relatively easy to set up and get operating, including connecting it to our in-home wireless network.  This is even more gratifying because I am anything but a \"cable guy.\"The picture is very pleasing, especially when displaying real HD content.  It really makes a difference compared with a non-HD TV (I suppose this is probably self-evident, but it's still impressive).Some of the challenges we have encountered include selecting the proper screen size in the software/setting of the TV.  It appears correct for some things and incorrect for others and it's not clear why for either.The reason the TV did not receive five stars has to do with the incredibly kludgy navigation within the TV.  Boy-O-boy has Apple spoiled us with user-friendly, intuitive, fast navigation.  This TV requires navigating with a large selection of letters and selecting each with the remote.  It feels very 1980s-ish (or before!).Also, Samsung's idea of \"apps\" leaves much to be desired and it remains to be seen whether this SMART TV is really smart at all.  The apps load slowly and it's unclear whether they do very much.  Samsung claims to have nearly 900 or so apps, but I'm not sure any are very useful.We also connected an Apple TV to the set, which was pretty simple, and its navigation is far superior and faster than the SMART TV navigation.All in all, so far very happy with our first foray into HDTV land.", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "surprise", "Author": "googola", "ReviewID": "R2RC3B1YLBBSUO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Such a deal.

Not a major gripe, just a minor annoyance (and something I could have avoided having carefully read the specs on the TV - I guess I just overlooked it upon purchase).  Another annoyance is that every now and then, the tv just randomly turns itself OFF.... yes... OFF.  It turns back on immediately with about a 2 second delay between picture displays, and only happens about every other use - maybe two instances each time when it chooses to occur.For a TV that gets used 4 days a week for only an hour or two each time, it's got its quirks, but the SmartTV Features are pretty nice, and VERY easy to use - well thought out for sure, the firmware updates are quick (though, I have fiber optic 25/25 Mbps net service here - so that probably helps too) and I haven't had any issue streaming netflix or pandora.  I can't speak to the quality of other applications on the TV at this time, as I do not use them.The picture is overall pretty good - I've noticed a few minor issues with image blur in fast scenes, but this might be a function of the tv being at a slightly different than ambient temperature, or the feed signal itself, I don't know - It's not usually an issue, and is never lasting.I've played PS3 on it, and that seems to work just fine.All in all, I picked this up as a black friday deal from Amazon - The TV arrived quickly courtesy of Amazon Prime (Great deal folks - I suggest checking out their trial/student memberships if you qualify) and in good condition.  I can't believe how light it is... so if weight is a concern - this TV is very lightweight, low profile, and easy to move around if needed.For the price I paid - I guess I can't complain too much - It serves its purpose, but has its drawbacks.

It's my first smart tv and I am very happy about it, I wasn't sure at the beginning... I don't watch much TV, I don't even have an antenna. I don't like tv schedules and most of the tv shows...I know, I'm weird! I prefer to be able to select the movies and the shows I want to watch... But I want to watch them in very good quality. I have to say that this tv allows me to do that for a very competitive price!The video quality is very very good. Don't get scared about the 60Hz thing, your eye will never see the difference... I don't know maybe video games players should care about it, but for normal tv products this tv is really good. It is very simple to set too. It has some audio profiles you can choose from, as well as video profiles.The audio is ok, as all the flat TV the speakers are on the rear so the quality is not THE best. But all the TVs has this problems so this is not a downside of this model in particular. If you care about audio quality I suggest to buy speakers to connect to the tv. I have a small living room so I am happy with the built in speakers (and for now I don't have money for a new set of speakers).The smart hub installed in the tv has netflix, amazon instant video, hulu, pandora and many other applications already built in, you just need to log in with your account. It also has a web browser, it is a little slow and the writing and selecting link with the tv remote control is a bit of a pain... but it's not like you are going to use it all of the times... you can also set your smartphone or tablet as a remote control so that typing will be easier.From Samsung you can download the all share application to your windows computer and it will wirelessly share photo, audio and video from the shared folder of your computer to the tv! It is really convenient! If you are a mac user you should check for Serviio software, I use it and it works smoothly.It have 2 usb slots on the side, one of them is auto powered so you can easily plug and external drive with the conents you want to watch on tv. More slots on the back panels. It also has a normal audio-in jack connector if you want to connect your ipod or if your computer doesn't has an HDMI port with audio. Be careful that the audio-in connector works with only one specific HDMI port, you'll finde the scheme of the connections in the user manual.If you are not looking for a giant screen but you want a good quality tv for a competitive price I really suggest you to buy this one.

I was in the market for a TV that I could use in our basement exercise area that could share the satellite signal with the DVR in our family room via a splitter.  The TV needed to be 1080P resolution to match that of the family room TV (splitter signals always default to the lowest connected TV resolution).  After reviewing alternatives, the Samsung UN32EH5300 looked to offer the most bang for the buck, especially since I was buying  at our actual cost.  Upon arrival, the Samsung was diverted to the master bedroom room, while the MBR 1080p unit went to my wife's office and the 1080p unit in her office wound up in the exercise room - musical TV's.  Bottom line evaluation of the UN32EH5300:Pros:- Great picture, with vivid colors and deep blacksSo-so:-Smart TV functions are okay, nothing to write home about.  Easy wifi connectivity and setup, but even with a Logitech wireless keypad, I much prefer surfing the web and checking email with my bedside tablet.  The SmartTv interface defaults to the Family Story app, which we don't use.  I do like the free video/movie access for Amazon Prime, but there's extremely limited volume range on movies like \"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\", requiring volume to be maxed out to hear the dialogue.  Adjusting any of the various sound functions (Movie, Clear Voice, Surround on/off, etc.) doesn't improve the situation.Cons:- VERY unstable base - gives new meaning to the words cheap and flimsy.  For our situation I prefer not to use a VESA wall mount, but a solid aftermarket desktop stand that  uses the VESA mount connectors on the TV is something I'm seriously considering.- The native sound volume adjustment is accompanied by a very irritating clicking noise. Be sure to select menu, then system, scroll down to general, then sound feedback, then select off.- HORRIBLE audio quality, regardless of control setting.  Lots of plastic-y resonance in the lower frequencies and distortion at higher frequencies.  Limited volume range magnifies the inherent problems.  This TV ***absolutely begs*** for an aftermarket sound solution, whether it's a sound bar or home theater package.  Right now I'm favoring the ZVox 555 as a one-solution-does-all as the best bet for me.  Lord, anything but the lousy internal speakers! BTW, I demo'ed the Bose Solo in the Bose store and could not detect the difference between the internal Samsung speakers and the Solo.I'll be a happy customer if I can solve the unstable base and audio quality issues, but until then I can't give this HDTV any more than three stars.

I didn't have this problem with my 2 other Samsung T.V.s that have the same internal usb function with the same external hard drive. But with other devices it works flawlessly and fast. It reads MKV files and MP4 files flawlessly and beautifully and I've been enjoying the shows on my hard drive so far.It's a beautiful t.v. to look at and I don't care if it's not an ultra slim Television, because it's still light weight and small.I chose this T.V. because this one was the cheapest out of all the LED t.v.s right now and even the more expensive ones only have 2 HDMI and only one Usb. This one has 3 HDMI and 2 USB plus a shared component/composite and digital audio out.I think this is/was a great investment. I got it for 597.99 (41% off) and I feel bad for anyone that buys it for more than 700 dollars.

Even though there tends to be quite a bit of lag in the Smart Hub, it does the job in the end.  If you have another smart device like a Roku, Apple TV, Blue Ray player, or gaming system, etc, you will be better off using those devices instead.  As far as the calibration goes, there are several preset options that look pretty good, but you can also manually set them yourself using many guides available in other reviews or on the internet.  After calibration, it has an amazing picture and works great with Directv.  The user interface is one of the best I've ever seen on a TV and easy to navigate.  The sound is pretty decent for a flatscreen TV.  The remote works well and is very well built.  The USB slots on the side of the TV really bring a lot of extra functionality with videos and external devices.  I tried attaching my wireless Logitech keyboard and it picked it right up.  I thought this was awesome that I could use a keyboard with the smart functions of the TV.  One thing I disliked is the keyboard is not supported in the Youtube app and doesn't add to it.  Overall, the TV does its main job perfectly and looks great.  If you are buying this TV solely for it's Smart features, it could be pretty awesome, but it's not quite there yet because of the lag.  It does work, but it can be pretty slow to get from one menu to another.  It does play Youtube, Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Hulu Plus very well, but I wouldn't expect much more out of the Smart Hub besides that.

He used to be a cable guy and has sworn off networks.  For this reason, I did TONS of research, including consumer reports.  I really thought this TV would be just what we needed.  It has a web-browser and makes it look like you can watch online shows. Things like nbc.com or hulu.com (for free, not plus).  However, the memory these streaming videos take, the TV cannot handle.  Anything more than a short youtube clip is too much for it to do.  I solved this, mostly, with a chromecast and a laptop we already had. It's a grainy picture, but not too bad.  The second way we watch TV is with amazon prime.  This TV says you can do that, but it is RIDICULOUSLY slow.  It takes forever to load the app.  You cannot watch HD amazon movies without it pausing to load at least 20 times.  It makes watching a movie a very big headache.  So I called Samsung. They had me reset everything and start the updating process (which honestly takes DAYS to complete) again.  The service agent was very friendly, but she admitted that Samsung designed the TV to not have enough memory for streaming online shows.  They \"want you to use the apps\" (and pay for them).  The reset sped up amazon for about a day until the TV updated again. Then it was back to pausing and loading 20 times.My husband thought it must be our internet or our router. We even had the phone company come check. Finally, today, I decided to hook a ROKU up to it.  If the ROKU will play amazon fine, then you know it is just the TV.  Sure enough, ROKU plays it great.Long story short:  I don't use any of the \"smart\" features on this TV.  Instead I use it with a chromecast and roku to watch the things I like.  Picture and sound quality is excellent.  I would be raving about the TV if I had bought it for 10 dollars less as a not-smart TV.

It takes FOREVER to launch the smart hub software and it thinks it needs to update every other day but the version numbers never change in spite of a \"update successful\" notification.  In addition, sometimes it cannot find my network and forces me to the network configuration wizard where it finds my router, perfect signal strength, gives me a successful connection message before telling me I don't have a network connection when I go back to launch an application (recently moved to wired, we'll see).

My Samsung LED is on point, perfectly clear and vibrant...you literally see every detail on the screen (sometimes shockingly clear..able to see the pores on a person face clear, saliva in their mouth, wiggling uvula clear). Not this LED, the main issue is flesh tones and fast movement on the screen. I have set this new tv the same as my old one, I have set it per the couple of popular reviews here on Amazon..I can get everything looking fairly sharp except people, everything else (plants, furniture, clothes etc) looks good, I will agree with another reviewer who was complaining about black and white colors....Often the flesh tones are wishy washy and not clear. Also, often when there is fast moment on the screen people/faces/things get blurry and or grainy. Another issue is this tv really varies station to station, some stations are crystal clear but others  are not at all..obviously those bad stations are not in HD BUT I do not have that issue with my LCD model..both are 1080 HD 32\"...I am shocked at the difference and consistency in pictures. Oh the remote and features...my 2 yo old  Samsung is just right, very user friendly but this newer one there is too much and the remote is not as intuitive..plus the search feature just is in the wrong spot and when you hit it by mistake which happens often at night in bed, it starts search  feature which frequently freezes everything. Oh the one thing I do like, you can press a button to light the keys of remote but it only stays on briefly.I have been over looking the above problems as a minor annoyances but the final straw is the flaky smarthub and software...this TV often freezes and or takes forever in smarthub and or while updating software. Some of the tv functions do not work while in smart hub mode..tonight it will not access internet, it accesses network but not internet, claims I need to call internet provider but everything else wireless in house is working fine...The only thing that has worked well with this has been Amazon Prime but now that is gone tonight..oh Samsung website has been down all evening so I can not get support...(Checked this morning TV/smarthub worked fine, so once again it was the buggy software and issues on Samsungs end, which happens all to often). Thankfully this is in my bedroom because if this was my main tv in living room and I had to deal with this nonsense everyday I would throw it through a window...actually I would have just returned it...and wishing now that I had.The smart hub is maddening, clunky, buggy and slow, so is the wifi connectivity! It often loses wifi connection for no reason.

I am a huge Sony fan however reviews and price made me consider the EH5300.1)  This set does not have any control buttons on the actual unit. Not even the basics such as ON/OFF, volume, channel. If you misplace or damage the remote control you are totally out of luck. Should the remote drop under a cushion or hide under the dog then you are screwed until it surfaces. Not certain how easy it would be to find a universal remote that would have enough features to cover the Samsung original.2) My household is still using the standard rooftop antenna. Occasionally we have to manually put the TV on a channel we know to be capable of pulling in a signal but which requires some time to lock onto it.When you set up this TV the initial autoscan to program available channels overlooks these weaker signals. When you attempt to manually enter one of these weak channels via the remote, the TV defaults back to last channel found in your \"autoscan\" list.For us this means losing three public stations and ABC.3) Called tech support. Sounded like it was somewhere in Asia. They were useless. These were not technicians in any sense of the true meaning. After way-too-many-minutes of pitiful \"help\" I finally asked for the phone number to Samsung corprate office in the US. Was told they were not permitted to give this out.4) When you adjust volume control, change channels, etc the remote gives off a \"beep\" noise.  Using the manual and surfing through \"Tools\" , \"Menu\", and \"Support\" keys I could not find a way to turn it off.Most likely there is a way, however finding out how is certainly not apparent. Which leads me to.....5) Setup is not friendly, especially for those still using antennas.Daily use is a pain with (for us at least) a poorly laid out remote.This product has been a disappointment. Has soured our household on future samsung purchases.About us...Our family does not require super fancy/high tech gizmos. We have a computer connected to our TV to double as a monitor.

Beautiful, compared to my \"antique\" Toshiba. Thin frame, stand is minimalist but does the job.  Nice feature: the little joystick hidden under the right bottom in case you lose your remote3. Sound - Pretty good for the price.  I did hook it up to a Panasonic Soundbar which helps me boost the dialog and get better soundstage.4. Set up:  Some folks complained.  I found it very easy to get it working with my FIOS Network..I chose to use ethernet cable because it's close to my router and I don't want it competing with my other wireless devices for bandwidth.  Learning the menus was pretty easy too.OK, now the frustrating part: \"SMART HUB\" is clearly not a mature product/service, and Sammsung does not provide what should be the minimal level of user friendliness.  First, I don't care how much the TV costs, if it offers web browsing and other apps requiring text entry, it needs to have a way to do it besides pecking away with a standard remote on a \"virtual keyboard\". It is literally and figuratively painful to do any text entry with the options available.  I don't believe you can use a wireless keyboard even if you buy one(I know there is no Bluetooth, I may try a Logitech and see if it worksThe \"HOME SCREEN\" is cluttered with absurd Samsung apps that many users will have no use for(such as children's programing) They take up huge real estate and cannot be removed or moved.  Moving from app to app is difficult.  I have a SMART PHONE by Samsung and all of it is user friendly. Sure, it uses Android.  But if Samsung is going to market this as \"Smart\" it should be.  The apps themselves all have different interfaces once you get inside,,,again, no standardization like you get with Android, IOS, etcFinally, a postive surprise. The quality of the streaming I'm getting eg with MLB TV app, Amazon Prime is superb. I can barely see any difference compared with my cable picture.  It's far superior to what I was getting with my ROKU attached to my old TV.Overall, a mixed bag.

I ended up sending a huge \"Darth Vader\" DLP TV to the junkyard via Best Buy when it was clear that the needed replacement chip was not going to be manufactured or provided by anyone.  IMHO our government regulators should have taken on both Samsung and the now defunct chip maker.This set represents the fifth purchase of Samsung TFT/LED technology I've made in the past few years.  I purposefully did not purchase the most sophisticated (3D) capable unit for my bedroom, but up-sized from 32\" to 40\" when a small CRT based TV finally failed in our guest bedroom.  The 32\" unit which is the oldest Samsung TV I own has now migrated to the guest room, and the new 40\" \"Smart\" TV has replaced it.When I finally had professionals pull Ethernet where I wanted it and built a little \"router shelf\" for my cable modem, router, and patch panel, etc., I pulled Ethernet to my bedroom, so when the new set came out of the box, I plugged in the Ethernet and it immediately began installing \"Patches\" from Samsung to its' built-in out of the box software that was shipped from Mexico a few weeks ago.  I'm still exploring the available apps and options the \"Smart TV\" provides.  I'm able to see photos and listen to MP3 tracks stored on a NAS hard drive connected via USB to my router.  The Samsung provided UI for the NAS file system sucks, but it works, slowly...in part due to the USB connection between the NAS drive and my router.  I'm still not quite sure whether the TV is tracking my network via Ethernet and logging in wirelessly to my wireless network, but with 24 mbps download speed from my cable provider, the internet video and sound features I've tried so far all work without the annoying waits typical of slower internet hookups, regardless of whether the path to the TV from the internet is via my 1000 mbps Ethernet or the 56 mbps wireless network in my house.I immediately set up some of the Apps, like TED for example, and my Pandora One account.  The built in speakers, as expected, are not what I'm prepared to live with long term.  I'm still debating spending under $200 for a widely available Samsung 5.1 surround sound unit with DVD which would seriously clutter up the dresser tops or require me to mount several speakers on walls, or getting one of those Zvox pedestal analog sound systems which would sit under the TV and connect to the TosLink output from the on board sound chipset and allow me to use my cable provider's remote for everything except the \"smart TV\" features.I also immediately set the picture controls for the usually darkened viewing room where the TV sits.  Both my wife and I are beginning to have issues with cataracts, so the larger screen and more intense color settings help.  I'm still not sure about the so-called 120 scan speed of this set which acts more like an interpolated 60 cycle scan than a true 120, which for me would be more than adequate.

I wasn't interested in the SmartTV features as I have both an XBox 360 and PlayStation 3, which makes those features incredibly redundant.  In fact, the two features I was looking forward to the most were this unit's three HDMI ports, which allowed me to dispose of my Belkin HDMI switch/splitter, and the fact that it's native 1080p, which meant my non-game XBox apps would finally look right.So, as a TV, this unit shines.  It's a no-frills unit from a physical standpoint.  It lacks the thick LG plastic border I had grown accustomed to, and I actually double-checked that it was indeed the right size.  With this television, the screen is paramount, and after spending some time with it, I have to say I prefer it that way.The picture itself is crisp, clear, smooth, and colorful, but like with any TV, getting it to that point takes a fair amount of tweaking.  Unfortunately, most of the settings Samsung has on by default hinder the picture.  The Eco settings are, by and large, useless.  They dim the picture in the presence of any light, and there's an auto turn-off setting as well.  More subtle are the picture and MPEG noise reduction filters.  These filters are designed to combat against lines/distortion present in the signal.  The problem is that it attempts to do so by blurring everything.  So what appears to be blurriness and/or ghosting is actually the noise filters doing their job.  The effect is really noticeable whenever a person is doing something, anything (talking, playing sports, walking, blinking, etc.) on screen.  Turn them off.The unit is also great as a game console monitor, but, again, it requires tweaking to get it to look just so.  I've found that, in addition to fiddling with the normal color/brightness/contrast settings, turning off the HDMI black and dynamic contrast help a lot.So, in conclusion, I find this unit to be a fine TV.  I can't speak to the apps as I don't have an interest in them, and will likely never use them.  If you do buy it, just be prepared to spend a fair amount of time tweaking the picture settings.

I have a 2 month old Sony Bravia that I'll reference for comparison.During setup, the base of the Samsung was made of cheap plastic - it's okay but nothing special.  Assembly of the base requires putting in 8 screws - easy and no problem.  But in comparison, my Sony only required 2 screws and the fittings were more solid.Wi-fi was a bit of a problem.  I set up this unit in the kitchen about 15 feet from my Sony in another room.  I am using a laptop in the kitchen all the time.  But the Samsung had a difficult time receiving the signal and took three tries before it paired with my WiFi signal.  The signal remained weak in setting up the internet services - I got an error message that it did not have a network connection (even though it was just connected) and had to go through setup a second time.  Overall I was glad to have built in Wi-Fi but thought the issues with the implementation were a problem.  We'll see if it continues to be an issue.  For comparison, my Sony Bravia with built in Wi-Fi and my Sony Blue Ray both did a much better job of receiving the Wi-Fi signal and as a result, setup was easier.I did see one comment on the internet about a problem with the TV turning off after 30-40 minutes. That issue is related to user error - there are instructions included with the TV that specify that this issue is from setting up the TV in Store Demo mode rather than Home Use.

Wrong.The TV when attached to Comcast cable produces excellent picture quality.  When you access the internet and try to watch video streamed from a website like YouTube, NBC, CNN etc, the image quality is bad, pixelated, halting and just plain lousy!Logically, in order to provide this technology, smart TV's need much of the guts of a computer to access the web.

Future calls revealed that it was in fact a Samsung firmware issue because on their platform they have both of these apps run off of the same server (or so they said).  Well it is now March 9 2014 and the issue is still not resolved.  Up until a few days ago they have refused to authorize a return (not Amazon but Samsung) until I filed a complaint with the BBB, now supposedly I will get a call from them in 2 business days regarding a refund (though I have been promised call backs multiple times and so far it has never happened).  My opinion is that they are a big company and there is no excuse for a firmware update to take over a month to fix and so if they have problems in the future (even if they ever fix this problem...which is still not fixed as of yet), if there are future problems they will take just as long.

Set it up (easily) and started watching. Changed the picture settings (following the settings another reviewer suggested) and liked the picture quality. Today, the TV screen is black, but has some life to the TV. In a totally black room with the tv on, if I shine a flashlight onto the screen I can (barely) see the menu screen items and scroll through the items using the remote.Contacted Samsung customer service and had to go through dead-ends: online chat, \"something seems to be wrong with your TV\"; online service request, \"you must do the trouble shooting first or we can charge you $55 for the service\"; and the call that I was told to make to contact about service, \"we are closed. call between 8am and midnight eastern standard time\".For a new TV to die in the first weeks of use makes me less than impressed with the quality of the components and/or quality of production. The TV may work well when it works, but a black screen is simply a zero on functionality.If the problem is resolved and a new TV is shipped or this one is fixed with no cost to me, and if the new/fixed TV works for at least six months without any problems, I can change my review, but for now, with my experience, it's a dead item with the lowest rating.12/18/13 update: Called Samsung service. They say I have to take the 32 inch tv into a service center myself for service. They gave me an address which is the closest to me, an hour and a half drive from my home on the other side of the island (Hawaii). They couldn't issue a shipping label to have the TV sent to a service center, so now I'm stuck with an extremely inconvenient trip to make to get this dead TV fixed. The Samsung service rep said I could call again after the service was all done to ask for some kind of compensation for the expense to get the TV to the place, but that is after the trouble of going will be had and will never repay for the lost time and costs related to that.Advice: If buying a TV, buy a 40 inch or larger. The service will be in home, not at a service center.

The Samsung has two very nice advantages over those old HDTVs. First, 1080p is really a must right now. Especially if you're a gamer and plan on getting the PS4 or Xbox One, 720p just won't cut it anymore. On top of that, this TV is LED backlit, which means it's far more energy efficient than old regular LCD TVs. (As a result, it also doesn't get as hot)But the advantages of upgrading don't stop there. This Samsung is a Smart TV, which means apps like Netflix and Amazon Instant Video are built into the unit. Better yet, since this TV is has a resolution of 1080p, the video looks beautiful (if your internet is fast enough, of course).The ports on this TV are basically what you'd expect. 3 HDMI, one component/composite, two USB, one coaxial, and then some audio in and out ports. There is also an ethernet port, but this TV also includes built in Wifi (which some other TVs don't offer).I do have one or two complaints about this TV. The Smart applications aren't as fast as they could be (i.e. They're faster on PS3). This TV is also only 60 Hz, instead of 120 Hz that many other TVs have these days. But both of those small issues root back to one thing, price. Considering the very respectable price of this TV, I'm willing to deal with those small hindrances.I'm very impressed with this TV and would definitely recommend Samsung as your TV choice.Update: I noticed after a month or so that this TV's Smart Hub and apps don't always work perfectly. Especially whenever you first turn on the TV, the Smart Hub is really slow and apps will fail to load occasionally.

I have Directv and later found that this TV is DTV capable using the RVU feature which was an unexpected bonus.  More on this feature later in the review.  TV arrived in 2 days via Amazon Prime.  Although this unit was listed as used, it was in fact, brand new, in perfect condition with a few blemishes on the box.  Wifi is Wireless N 5gh capable which is a huge plus.  Absolutely no issues with the Smart TV feature as other reviewers have complained about.  I can only assume that they're using a Wireless G 2.5 gh connection which would explain why they would have issues with that feature.  TV picture was fine out of the box as I haven't had much time to tweak the picture.  The only reason that I gave this TV 4 stars rather than 5 was the very steep learning curve using the RVU feature with Directv.  There is no mention of this capability in the user's guide and Directv will insist on sending out a service tech for a fee.  After multiple phone calls with Directv and speaking to reps that didn't seem to know what I was talking about, I spent hours researching DTV blogs and finally came to the conclusion that I needed a DECA (Directv Ethernet to Coax Adapter) or the whole home DVR service.  You also cannot use this feature with the wireless adapter on the TV which kind of defeats the purpose of going wireless in the first place.  You can use this with a wireless video bridge and an ethernet cable (cat 5 or 6 only) or plugged directly into your router which isn't convenient for my purposes.  I bought a DTV wireless Cinema Kit and used my existing video bridge for a \"Hard Wired\" connection over wireless and the RVU service works flawlessly.  (No thanks to Directv) If you're not very tech savvy then I highly recommend leaving the install to a professional.  I didn't want to spend the cash for a service call and didn't want anyone drilling holes in my walls to add the additional coax cables.  To save other owners of this TV the time and energy, I have a recommended process for setting up Directv RVU services for the do it yourselfer.1.) You must subscribe to Directv and have an HR 34-44 Receiver and a robust home network.2.) You must either have Whole Home service already setup OR have a DECA that you connect to your coax feed coming from the dish to the receiver.3.) You must call DTV and add the Samsung Smart TV to your account as a Genie Client for a $6.00/month charge.  If the CSR doesn't know what you're talking about ask for Advanced Tech support.4.) Select the input as RVU and go to setup on your receiver for Whole Home-Add Client.  Take down the pin#5,) Once you select Directv RVU from the input menu on your TV, enter the pin# and name the location.  You can either use the TV remote or purchase a Genie Mini remote and program it for Samsung TV.UPDATE: I ended up returning the Cinema Connection kit and getting a Directv Wireless Video Bridge and a Wireless Genie Client (through Amazon)due to the limitation of the RVU feature of the TV.  You have to create a MOCA network using DTV DECA and it's a wired setup.  I needed a wireless solution due to not having coax to the area that I needed to use the TV.  It cost about $200.00 for the wireless solution whether you order directly through DTV or purchase separately through Amazon.  I have come to the conclusion that although the feature works well it's not for the do it your self networker unless your willing to run coax cable and you understand how the Directv system is wired.

I wanted a bigger screen, but didn't want to push my video card harder with higher resolution. I am very happy with this monitor. When you first get it, it is important to rename the PC/Mac input to PC or PC/DVI. It increases response time (decreases lag) and removed post-processing. Second, if you own a Mac, do yourself a big favor and buy the program SuperCal. It's only $19 but it will save you some stress of setting the levels. The first 2 times calibrating I wasn't that happy with the result and I thought maybe it wasn't going to work well as a monitor. But, I kept trying and especially focused on the \"optional\" white level adjustment in SuperCal. It made all the difference. Once you struggle with white levels for a while to get a true white, it works great as a monitor. One thing to note, however, is that since text is blown up, you WILL see kind of jagged text unless you turn sharpness down. But, this is pretty much the way big 1080p monitors are. My previous monitor, an Asus VE278 had the same issue. On Windows 8, I didn't notice as much of a problem. It does text smoothing differently.

You're better off getting a Google TV attachment or that Chrome air HDMI+USB thing. I won't say Roku or Apple TV as they are not comparable to what Samsung attempted here.Do not buy it looking forward for the smart function to shine. I had hope that the pending update was going to fix things but not by much, its barely bearable now.Set your TV's DNS to 8.8.8.8 to avoid graying your hairs connection wise. I'm willing to update my review if the software ever improves.Pros:The TV & Picture:If this TV does anything right, its the picture quality. Its excellent for a tv under $500 & it rivals TVs over $500.Black levels & the vividness of the colors are excellent & adjustable (both).The adjustment options are pretty thorough, its energy saving setting are pretty easy, it has a respectable amount of ports, 3 HDMI, 2 USB (They have different designations, one is (HDD 5v 1A) & the other (5V 0.5A).Sound wise, its ok. If you have a sound system or are in the midst of getting one, do so. Volume levels are respectable butto be fair, this TV is in my room. You may want a modestly priced system for a living room. I'm looking at Logitech myself.The remote is smooth and easy to use for regular functions, its pretty basic. This might be another thing that kept the price down,If it had a better or simply smoother smart TV function, I would've called this a con.Final say:Its a great TV & I doubt you will find better quality under $500 as of this date.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great buy", "Author": "Michael D.", "ReviewID": "R9WZ6UJJH5HDY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 1st LED TV and without doubt it is second to none.

I requested a return via Amazon and they complied. By now the TV should be on its way back to their warehouse. After asking for a refund, I also ordered another TV here on Amazon as well, and oh boy, I am happy that this Samsung TV failed because the one I got afterwards, even if a bit more expensive, it's way better in any possible way.Thumbs up to Amazon for their awesome customer service. I just provided a bit of information regarding the TV and they sent a UPS guy to pick it up, no questions asked, to ship it back to their warehouse.My advice to anyone planning to buy this TV is: do your research. It seems like these TV's tend to fail often and you could find yourself without a TV sooner than you think. However, if your unit happens to work, you will own an awesome TV for half the price other TV makers ask for.Good luck, and again, thank you Amazon for your awesome customer service!PS:Just in case anyone cares, the new TV I ordered is this one, from Panasonic and I love it:Panasonic TC-L42E60 42-Inch 1080p (Right here on Amazon.com!).", "Date": "July 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ridiculous support", "Author": "greataunt", "ReviewID": "RULYLRVT0IVZZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Each time I want to use an account such as Skype or Pandora they keep pushing down \"updates\" and wipe out my login info as well as the settings on my devices, such as my home theater and internet login info.

Set up was a piece of cake and we could try Netflix after 10 minutes. Still have to go trough all features and learn on our on as manual regards solely to TV set.Only minor thing is the sound, as speakers are not so potent but one can solve that with a hometheater, which is not her mother's case.Bear in mind it is a full HD TV set with lots of features for less than U$450,00!!!!Excellent bargain!!Well, I am editing this review to add what I suspected but had to try before affirming: some Wireless keyboards and mice will fully function with this TV set. The one I purchased was a Microsoft. All I had to do was to plug the USB adapter on TV side port and \"presto\"!! Web browsing is now available to my wife's mother, who is 70 and can now browse the internet from the comfort of her bed!! You must get used to a few adjustments in how to opperate it. You use the mouse to click where you want; whenever you want to write use wireless keyboard but, when enetering any website which requires your login and password, \"enter\" (after inputting login and password) must be done with the mouse. If you are posting something on facebook, for instance, after writting everything you need, press the 'enter' key so that Samsung virtual keyboard will disappear and then use mouse to click on 'post'. This is important hint, because Samsung's virtual keyboard can be covering \"post\" icon and thus preventing you from posting. Also interesting is the zoom. She uses it in 150% when on facebook website.This is the way it works with Microsoft Wireless Desktop 800. I don't know how other wireless devices will interact with Samsung 32UNEH5300. However, I guarantee my experience when testing it for my mom's mom (I just don't like calling her mother-in-law) was great!! Some Youtube videos will not be as good as Netflix, but mostly due to the quality they were recorded, web traffic and your download speed. Should this tree be above average and you always choose HD youtube videos, you won't have problems.

"Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this tv for a month and so far it is working great! It is very light weight and has a semi thin bezel. The picture and sound quality are both great too! The initial setup was very easy including the wifi setup so I was done within 20 minutes. Samsung's app store for the smart tv is not nearly as huge as you would like but the smart tv is a new trend so I know devs will continue to support this technology. I have a samsung phone with gingerbread installed on it. Samsung offers a remote app in google play which allows you to use your samsung phone as a remote and it works great! But if you have android 4.0 your phone will not be compatible with the current app remote until Samsung updates the software. Using the supplied remote can be hard to use for navigating through the internet and typing in searches so if you have the remote app installed on your samsung phone I would recommend using it. Sound and picture quality are both clear and very responsive. Watching movies through apps such as vudu or through hdmi show great and have no lag or buffer time. I purchased a $7 hdmi cable from bestbuy and i can't see any difference between mine and a $30 cable. I purchased this tv a month ago directly from Amazon and it has already went down in price by $30 so this may be a great gift for Christmas. If you want to save money by not getting cable service I would recommend getting this tv. Some of the default apps include facebook, youtube, mlb and pandora. Netflix also comes as a default app which I think is a great alternative to cable. One great reason is becuase I'm new to netflix and I have found every cable show I used to watch with several seasons on netflix so $8 a month is worth it. Vudu is another great movie/show app that comes preinstalled. They don't offer a monthly subscription like netflix instead you have to pay per movie or show. With Vudu they give you $5.99 in free credit so that you can watch a movie or show for free! This is also offered on the ps3 so that means you can what 2 free movies if you have both! Other brands such as LG and Sony also offer smart tvs but I like the samsung smart tv price and interface better.

They are good value for the price and we like the screen quality.  I opted for the SmartTV feature as the TV is mounted on a wall and there is no room to mount the ROKU.  Unfortunately the SmartTV has several disadvantages.  First, the built-in wifi antenna is very weak (ROKU works fine in the room) so I had to purchase an ethernet powerline adapter to get it to work.  Second, the SmartTV is slow compared to ROKU and I've had numerous drops and freezes.  I've only used the streaming functions, but it's slow enough that I'm not going to bother with web browsing.  Finally, the remote jams every known button into a stick that is impossible to use without staring at the buttons.  Samsung really needs to look at the simple remotes from Amazon, ROKU and others.I will give Amazon big kudos for their tech support.  I called to ask questions about setting up the TV.

Amazon won.  Especially with free 2 day shipping with Prime.$577.99 directly from Amazon.It seems that since Amazon sold out, prices have been a bit higher from third party sellers.  Which is to be expected.I had previously had a 57\" Samsung DLP which the movers dropped (youch), when I purchased a new TV, the Toshiba Regza was the best deal.  Now it seems the Samsung LED is the best deal for a decent size TV.Notes about TV: Very thin bezel compared to the previous Toshiba I had.  The TV model is a year old now, but it's still a Smart TV.  I actually use my PS3 since my speakers are wired through that device and not the TV.  If you don't have a smart Blu-Ray or PS3/4 or Xbox 360/1 then it's easy to wire the TV to speakers with a digital optical cable and set up the streaming services directly through the TV.  It works best hard wired with an ethernet, but has wi-fi as well.The menus are very nicely laid out.  Good color options.  You can adjust the color settings manually, but they have good presets.  Dynamic is great for movies, but can sometimes be a bit dark for video games.Overall a good value TV from a trusted brand.

I bought it for the bedroom for occasional use. TV doesn't have a sleep timer, but has a power off that can be set if controls are not used for a certain period of time, apparently it doesn't work as my TV ran all night and it was set for 2 hours.Channels, another downfall, unless the TV found the channel in the search you just can't type a channel that is hasn't found it won't accept it. I lost the signal to a couple channels and it wipes that channel out and you can't type it back in unless you let it do a full search, another 20 minutes gone every time you do that. I have a 7 to 8 year old Toshiba DLP TV in the living room and for some reason the channels on that TV are not the same channel number on this TV, For instance, ME TV is channel 64-3 in the Toshiba it is 64-5 on this TV, go figure!I understand that technology is evolving but things shouldn't be this complicated to use.

I can even go to Hootsuite and via the web browser and post from there. I was on the fence with this one or Vizio and while the Vizio model is also a great TV this one was just more of what I wanted as the one that compared in price by Vizio did not include a web browser nor did it have Vimeo app. So for my needs the Samsung Smart TV was all I needed and then some.

The pre-installed apps are really horrible, there are few apps that are decent. I am only using the Netflix app with this TV. If you are purchasing this product because it is a smart TV, I think you will be sorely let down.Samsung has quite a lot of work to do in order to provide quality media products, in my opinion. The Smart Hub could be simplified, the pre-installed apps could be removed, more memory could be added to it, and a faster CPU could be added.The quality of the picture is great and can be adjusted to several different presets or customized to your liking, I cannot comment on the audio since I am hard-of-hearing and I use the closed captioning with the audio low or off.The Wi-Fi connectivity is acceptable. I have had issues with it disconnecting but then other devices on my network have disconnected so that is most likely an issue on my end.Other accessories can be purchased for this (not necessarily from Samsung) that can help make text input or selections easier, for an example, wireless mouse and keyboards.After 7 months of ownership, and changing just a few settings, it has decided to start sporadically rebooting while either watching TV or while I'm using the Netflix app. I have reset to factory defaults several times which clears it up for a while and then it starts rebooting again. While doing a web search to try to find a resolution to this issue, I have found that other models from Samsung also sporadically reboot. So far i have not seen a good resolution to this issue posted on any site.To sum up: I like this TV for the quality of the picture but the other features of this TV are not worth the expense.", "Date": "May 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great unit", "Author": "Don Dell", "ReviewID": "R34FARAWUGA2GC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love it.

It's not top of the line of course, but it's a solid TV for the price. Walmart has it, but Amazon is a much better deal. So if you get it, don't get it at Walmart - get it on Amazon and just plan to be home for its delivery. Warning: The packaging is not at all discreet. It comes in just its store box and it's quite obviously a TV, even from afar. That's why I say plan to be home, or have it delivered to your work if your boss will allow. My husband and I both had to work on the day it was scheduled to be delivered and our UPS guy refused to even leave it when he realized nobody was home - we were still at work when we saw the failed delivery status.Anyway, as I was saying, this is a good TV within most people's budget. We probably would not pay much more for a TV than we did for this one - especially since we don't have cable and probably never will. We are avid Hulu and Netflix users. The TV we had before was only 19 inches, so this is certainly an upgrade. A friend of ours tried to say that 32 inches is too small - that we could easily have gotten something bigger for only about a hundred dollars more. That friend is crazy. He may be right, but we live in a small apartment and believe me, anything bigger would not have fit in our living room. No, this TV is just the right size. Not everyone has a big enough living room to hold a 46-inch TV. Well, certainly not us lower middle class folks!What we really like about this Samsung TV is that we can connect it to our Samsung phones (with an MHL to HDMI cable). This is how we have to watch YouTube. That's one thing that disappointed us - this TV (or at least this older model) doesn't have YouTube. We would say that YouTube is right up there with Netflix in popularity, hence why we find its absence from this TV so ridiculous. It has a \"LinkToYouTube\" app, but it's totally not the same - it just opens YouTube in the browser. The browser, I have to say, only serves to be a nuisance if you don't have a wireless keyboard and mouse. One reviewer said the \"Smart\" aspect can be very glitchy at times and I agree - an app can, at times, take forever to load, and there have even been times we've had to turn off the TV and turn it back on for it to do anything.Okay, I realize I've contradicted myself in this review. What can I say, I suck at writing reviews. I started out saying it's a good TV, then instead of going into full detail about its pros, I went into full detail about its cons. It is a good TV, just maybe not a good Smart TV. Oh well... It isn't bad for the price! We have had good experiences overall with Samsung products, and aside from the lack of a YouTube app and Smart glitchiness, we would put this TV on our list of good Samsung experiences. Like I said, the picture quality is excellent and the screen mirroring capability with our phones is also pretty sweet.

Probably the best I have ever seen. A downloaded HD Netfix version of House of Card just blew me away. The picture alone makes thisTV worthwhile. just from the fact that you have a browser within the Smart TV app makes spending a couple extra bucks all worthwhile. I cant give it 5 stars because my Netflix does not always work the first time with this TV, I actually have to try a couple times sometimes before i can get in. That's pretty annoying because sometimes I have had to give up all together. At least there are many Plan B options. Secondly, you can buy a wireless keyboard to speed up the web browser but the keyboard does not  work properly with the other apps. But did i mention how good the picture is...... You will not be dissapointed with this TV. I have had had it for 2 months already and I have barely scratched the surface on what it can do5/23/144 months into this TV and I can give an update. Picture Quality is still the biggest asset and it has to be mentioned every time especially when downloading stuff off the internet. But I finally found something I have to be critical of and its not because of the TV itself. I think its Samsung. During peak periods when you really want to watch TV using apps such as HBO GO and Netflix do not always load. I used to think this was a problem with bandwidth of my internet supplier but I am almost certain that this is happening because of Samsung.

I found that the AV receiver could still be used but the optical out sound quality was poor with some HDMI sources. It turns out that the TV only forwards 2.0 sound.Operation with the computer connected has been fine. Unlike some other reviews I didn't have to change the input name to \"PC\" to get a good image. In fact it made no difference what I called it.

This appears to be, at the time of purchase, the least expensive of Samsung\u2019s Smart TV series. My main concern was a good picture, but having \u201csmart\u201d features added to the package was icing on the cake. After seeing many good reviews for this TV, I decided to recommend it to my sibling.I can say that I wasn't disappointed by the picture quality. When setting up a new television, I like to find the recommended settings for picture quality. I noticed the recommendations some have provided on Amazon\u2019s reviews. Having a Sound & Vision Home Theater Tune-Up DVD in my possession (a bit dated, but satisfactory for picture setup), I decided to use it to adjust the picture settings. This DVD has test patterns for contrast, brightness, sharpness, color, and tint. Below I list the values I got using this disk:Contrast: 90Brightness: 47Sharpness: 36Color: 40Tint: G46/R54I left the backlight at the default Standard setting of 12. I did not change the default advanced settings either. After the adjustments, the picture looked quite good to me \u2013 not that it didn\u2019t look good before. This is the second Samsung TV I have used, and in both cases, the picture looked pretty good right out of the box.When you turn on the TV for the first time, it will walk you through the necessary initial set up including setting your Wi-Fi settings if you are not using Ethernet. If using Wi-Fi, have your passphrase ready to enter.For the Smart TV, there is a plethora of apps just waiting for you to explore. At the top of the screen is Netflix, Amazon Video, Shop TV, M-Go (movies and TV), and HBO GO. Below this are some main apps, such as Samsung Apps, Movies & TV Shows, Fitness, Kids, Media Hub, and Social TV. Below this are even more apps! We have Channel Favorites (program your favorites), Web Browser, Schedule Manager, FIOS TV, VUDU HD, Pandora, Source, Samsung Link, Link to YouTube, Hulu Plus, Explore 3D, Tune-In, and TWC TV. Wow! One note about the Web browser: you will have to navigate using your remote control \u2013 not fun. Some people have managed to interface a Logitech keyboard to the TV, but I don\u2019t think this is officially supported by Samsung. It certainly should have been an optional item, I think.Hey, bottom line is: I don\u2019t think you will be disappointed with this affordable TV.", "Date": "March 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good values", "Author": "M.

Note that the two USB ports sport different available voltage currents, conveniently printed right next to the USB ports.  To take full advantage of options and the like, you will soon realize that you need at least a wireless mouse, better yet a wireless combo keyboard/mouse.

It also is perfect for DLNA applications as well. Samsung has implemented the DLNA standard very well in my opinion. Controlling the rendering device (TV) and the source (HDHomeRun Prime and media server from Windows PC) from my phone (Android with BubbleUpnp) is great! :DMy Setup:- ASUS RT-N66U Router- HDHomeRun Prime w/ Comcast Servixe- TP-Link Nano Powerline Adapter Kit (AV500)- The SmartTV mentioned aboveThe tv is connected to the powerline adapter which has a connection to the router and the rest of devices. The initial TV setup was simple. Plug in the tv to the network, let it update itself, download HDHomeRun application, and profit. :DOnce the app in the tv was running, it behaved as a real TV where you can enter channel numbers. With other DLNA solutions, you would have to scroll through a list to get to the channel you wanted.  With this, it's like a real tv.In simpler words, this tv is perfect if you just want a tv set to watch TV with your HDHomeRun Prime box.The ONLY con is the fact that the app in the tv WILL NOT run on Wifi for obvious reasons (limited bandwidth over Wifi). You can solve this issue easily with a powerline adapter unless a ethernet connection is available.Also on another note, this tv DOES support 5.0GHz networks out of the box. I could never find the specifications online about the Wifi so I figure this review could answer that question.If you just want a network TV without any other longering boxes connected to it, get this. It'll literally play anything you throw at it, including HDHomeRun Prime channels.", "Date": "March 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent SMART TV option", "Author": "rob horton", "ReviewID": "R1S4J3OJ9XWZ5H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great picture, very easy to program, like fit/finish.

I was interested in the concierge service if I had any issues also 3 yrs warranty that went with the Costco deal.  It replaced my 30 yr. old Motorola that was flawless but we were getting tire of the picture quality and the goofy decoder box issues.The picture quality is excellent with a over the air antenna. Sound quality from the internal speakers is satisfactory for the kitchen area where we have this TV.  If I have any complaints, it is with trying to get all the features and functions I have with my SONY blueray player. I have yet to figure out how to access Crackle with this TV.  The best I can do is access Crackle videos on the YOU TUBE feature.It was very easy to get up and running and connected to my DSL router by following the instructions on the TV screen and the prompts.  I did read the instruction manual and in the manual they referenced a part to keep the TV from falling over with a TV HOLDER set.  It has to be bought as an accessory and does not come with the TV.  I spent the better part of 2 hours in the Samsung \"customer service\" runaround.  I could not get the part from Samsung online nor could I get it from two different \"800\" numbers  I was referred to along with all the waiting to get someone to actually take my call. I finally put in a customer service email and it has been two days and no answer to my email query for this part.Bottom line...

We bought this TV as a replacement for the bedroom wall.We didn't want to have to string a bunch of cables or worry about connecting other streaming devices externally, so a Smart TV seemed like the best option. The UN32EH5300 seemed like the perfect size and price, and had all of the features we wanted.This is an excellent TV. The picture quality is as good as our larger Sony HDTV in the living room, the TV is very light so I feel good about it being secure to the wall mount, and the Smart Hub is incredible. With all of the built in apps (like Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Prime, etc), we almost don't need much else for this TV. However, the Samsung Link option, which I didn't know much about when we bought the TV, has turned out to be an amazing feature. I can send any video, music or image content from my laptop or Surface directly to the TV wirelessly. On the laptop, I just had to install the Samsung Link software, and on my Surface, I just have to use the built-in \"Play-To\" feature, which didn't even require any setup for sending content through the Surface desktop screen (although there was a registry change I had to make to get it to work flawlessly with the Metro Apps, but that was on the Surface side of things, not the TV). The YouTube app is great because you can pair the TV with your YouTube account and send videos directly from any device as long as YouTube is open on both the device and the TV.Even though the Sony TV in our living room has a Smart Blu-Ray player and a PS3 hooked up to it with all of the same apps, the ability to use the Play-To feature and direct sending of content from devices and YouTube on the Samsung TV make me wish our Sony TV had the same ability.Overall, this was a great purchase that we've been very happy with.", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "More consistent quality", "Author": "Norman K.

I had tried to call Samsung and they were super terrific but since this was not a defect in the product but a problem that occurred due to Amazon's handling, I had to try to return it with them first. I returned it at the nearest FedEx and waited for a replacement from amazon.When the replacement came i did a quick scan of the packaging but it was dark on my porch. It wasn't until the delivery man drove off that i noticed in the exact same spot as the previous box there was a similar hole jabbed.

I like toys and I like having all the apps etc. on the television. I will need to move it around in the house to find a good location because it doesn't handle light very well - even with the Eco Sense shut off.What this review is about is a major flaw in my opinion. I have ADSL internet service and have never experienced an issue with my internet service since it was installed. The same day I purchased the television, my internet service became intermittent and unreliable. I work from home most days and losing service is a major earth-shattering issue for me. I contacted my provider and they insisted the problem was that I customized my modem and created my own private IP scheme instead of using the default. Any fellow IT jockey out there knows this is definitely not the problem. Although tech support insisted nothing was wrong, I am extremely upset Centurylink would employ tech support idiots that suggest having a valid private class C addressing scheme is preventing the problem.Two days later, I'm calling the local cable company for quotes to bring in internet. I then noticed a miraculous event - my internet is working fine but as soon as I watch the news, it goes out. I isolated devices on my network and lo and behold, this television is messing with my ADSL signal. I moved the modem to a different room than the television and all issues resolved. The Xbox cannot connect to the internet on this television because of the signal being thrown out.The television deserves a rating of 1 simply for this reason. There is no disclosure from Samsung and Samsung's response to me was that perhaps I should accommodate the idiosyncrasies of the television rather than them providing a solution. Those ferrite items in the box that supposedly correct this issue have no effect.So just take this as a warning. If you have internet service from the phone company, do not place your television in the same room or connect any devices to the television that use internet.", "Date": "February 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "32 inch Samsung smart TV was bought as a Christmas gift", "Author": "Roger Hartsoe", "ReviewID": "R1ABDZ9GESGUIG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "received the television on time and in good condition.

This was our first digital or smart TV. Setup out of the box was easy, the stand is stable and looks good. It is connected to an overhead antenna for broadcast TV reception and it does very well with that. The picture is great. Initial setup was fast and easy. Connection to our Wi-Fi network was the same and it is very reliable with that. The \u201cSmart\u201d TV functions are a disappointment. Perhaps more realistic expectations would have been better. Samsung customer service on the phone and online chat is exemplary, it could not be better. I have needed to use that service both on the phone and chat 4-5 times for issues not covered in manuals or of a technical nature. The Smart Hub on our TV is evidently the early 2012 version, it must have been sitting around in the box for a while; hence, the good price. It cannot be upgraded to the latest Smart Hub version. The central search function in the Smart Hub has never worked, evidently a known problem that Samsung is working on. The \u201cAll Share Play\u201d app has been replaced by \u201cSamsung Link\u201d which has no PVR setup so there is no way to record programs regardless of adding extra memory such as a hard drive. Evidently the PVR structure in All Share Play was buggy and maybe that is why it is no longer available. There are several apps that are designed to play about any TV show or movie you can think of but all of them require either a per-show fee or an ongoing fee to the app company, e.g. Netflix. The middleman fees mean you cannot watch TV programs for free that you could on an internet browser. We had hoped to be able to watch streaming video programs from broadcasters web sites on the Samsung internet browser in the Smart Hub but it cannot do that that, think NCIS or Good Wife. The proprietary browser does not have nearly the capabilities and functions of full purpose browsers like MS Explorer or Safari. It is fine for light web surfing. We did connect a Logitech K400 wireless keyboard with built in touchpad and it connected fast and easily and works well. It is much easier to use that then the remote control for text fields. As we have no other PVR or DVR we have no recording capability with this TV. We\u2019ll connect our laptop to it with an HDMI cable run, an inexpensive option for screen replication and we\u2019ll watch the TV shows from broadcasters\u2019 internet sites that way. Having to do that along with the other limitations of the Smart Hub system sort of negates the need for the smart functions. For us the convenience of having the Netflix app is nice and the wife uses one of the exercise apps which has no fee. A standard HD TV with computer connected would probably be more functional than the Smart TV. Nonetheless, the Samsung Customer Service Representatives are great.

I would highly recommend this tv, if this is your price point and you either don\u2019t have home theatre or you can make use of the optical out. I bought an optical cable for six bucks. No big deal.Get the free app to turn your tablet or phone into a remove (I recommend the third party app, not the official Samsung app which has bad reviews).

TV setup was a cinch, connected quickly to wifi. One bug kept me busy for a full day: At first it looked like the TV apparently has no Audio Return Channel (ARC) capability, allowing it output audio to my receiver through HDMI, without running a separate digital optical cable up my wall to the unit. (This is somewhere between desirable and critical for anyone who wants to stream digital audio from the Internet apps on this TV -- such as Amazon's Prime video service, or Cloud Player for music -- back through an audio system, rather than listen to them on the TV's transistor-radio-quality speakers.)Fortunately, one helpful reviewer here informed me that the TV actually DOES have ARC capability, hidden in the \"HDMI 2\" port, although this is completely undocumented in the manual. By using that HDMI port -- unmarked as an ARC port -- to connect to my receiver, I was finally able to enable ARC and eliminate one cable going up the wall. (I'm sort of shocked that a manufacturer like Samsung doesn't make ARC standard equipment; one of the big advantages of HDMI -- the lack of a big wad of cables -- is negated if they don't support the standard in their equipment.)Note: Even after switching to the No. 2 HDMI port I STILL had to run the Samsung's \"AnyNet\" setup (by doing a \"refresh\") to get it to recognize the AV receiver. This scans the TV's HDMI ports for compatible devices, allowing you to, for example, use the Samsung remote to change the volume on your receiver, synchronize shut-offs, etc. The Samsung still doesn't list it as a linked device, but it does see it, and the ARC is working.Other stuff: The 32 inch feels about the right size for a smallish exercise room where I'm usually 8 feet away or less. Farther, and I'd probably want the 40. Wall mounting is easy. The TV is light, and it has a standard 200mm VESA setup. I coupled the TV with the VideoSecu swivel mount here: 0972683275 It's very solid, and the TV fits the square plate without using those long attachable arms.I agree with the assessment of others that the \"Smart TV\" functions are nice in concept, but buggy. The home screen that hosts them is not customizable and the entire operation is buggy at times and prone to hanging up. I have a fast wifi router close by, and when it's working it streams fast, with no noticeable freezes in music or HD video playback. But it has hung up in the process of loading the \"Smart TV\" page a number of times already. I suspect hard-wiring it into the network would improve that performance, but then you get another cable running up the wall! All in all, it's a nice flat-panel with a lot of features for the price, but it's far more difficult to integrate into a home theater setup than it should be.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "excelente producto!!!", "Author": "ruben antonio mendez castillo", "ReviewID": "R2QGB5JOVVKJ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "guao best excellent product actually arrived as expected products are the best high definition details of the best tv they remain grateful that they know are going to do very bein happy afternoon and greetings from Venezuela", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic picture; great price.", "Author": "Dee", "ReviewID": "RHQ48TCDDNC54", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recommend you follow the setting recommendations of 1 or 2 of the other reviewers.

It was to replace an old 32\" tube TV in our 2nd (small) living area. This is our first \"smart\" TV and we've been enjoying that aspect of it immensely. We are Amazon Prime members and we've been watching so much programming on Prime that our TV in the main living area has been kind of neglected for the last few weeks.I adjusted the picture settings as posted by one of the reviewers here and the video quality is outstanding whether we are watching HD programming on Prime, DirecTV or BluRay movies. The only negative issue we have with this TV is that the speaker location makes for fairly crappy sound. But that's an issue with flat screen TVs in general, not this model/series alone. So the next purchase for this setup is a decent sound bar to install on the wall below the TV.Update 4/23/14:  We have been watching a number of series on Prime Instant Video. We had some intermittent issues where the program would continually pause for seconds or minutes before continuing. Earlier this week it got to the point where we could not Resume a program where we had left off and were getting some network error messages. Other streaming content like Pandora was trouble free. Last night I downloaded and installed the latest firmware update (March 2014) for the UN46EH5300 (46-inch set) and that seems to have corrected the problem.The other thing I have done to enhance our enjoyment of this TV is to install a 38\" Vizio sound bar with wireless subwoofer. That has made a huge difference as dialogue is much more clear, music is so much richer and sound effects are really good. If your flat screen TV is not connected to a surround sound system, a sound bar is highly recommended.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great T.V.", "Author": "Kristina Kucker", "ReviewID": "R1XOEKBCQ9O23P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can not believe what this T.V. can do.

It's a great set, and using the specs another user outlined in a previous comment, the picture quality really looks fantastic. I love the smart aspect of it, and since I currently don't have cable service, I've been watching lots of Netflix and streaming Pandora. Also, the audio on this set is SPECTACULAR. It really brings out the bass of songs and movies without being overwhelming, and I presume it'll do the same for video games. And it can get LOUD. I have yet to see what it sounds like at even 25% of its max volume since I haven't ever needed it to get much louder than that, but I bet it'll shake the stars senseless if it ever gets to its maximum (IMAX home theater, anyone?). It's a perfect size for me, and light, and I'm really happy with it. I bought the set primarily as a gaming television, so I'll update this after I bring my PS3 and get some games going on it. At that point, I'll comment on the picture quality and audio of the system and how it works with my gaming setup.CONS: Like it said in the description, it can connect to the internet, but I swear to whatever non-denominational god there is, if you want to use this function, do yourself a big, big favor and turn your smart phone into a remote or get a wireless keyboard and mouse -- if you try to use the included remote to navigate, the cursor will literally crawl across the screen. Also, since I don't have cable yet, the picture-in-picture shown on the Smart Hub is a tad annoying since right now it's showing the dizzying white blizzard typical of a TV with no channels. I have yet to find out how to disable this while in the Smart Hub, but I'm working on it. Since it's super glossy, it'll also show dust really easily, so you'll have to be after it with the included cleaning cloth pretty frequently to keep it looking sparkly.But I still rated it a 5 because it's a spectacular TV with some minor, nitpicky flaws that I got for a great price. I'd buy it again too if I had to and I'd definitely recommend it to my friends. And I recommend it to you as well.

The built-in Smart Apps are very helpful enabling me to use this TV to play Pandora, stream movies from Amazon, Netflix and even my home movie library on my network NAS. Having an internet browser built-in is handy though not very practical without a better keyboard. I am also pleasantly surprised at the low power requirements.On the down side, using the internet browser can be frustrating using just the TV remote. The internet browser also lacks full featured functionality. For example, SmugMug photo galleries don't display properly.

The TV does not have Bluetooth for connection of a keyborad or mouse. So, for internet browsing, we still use a computer. There is a more sophisticated Samsung Smart TV that can connect to a keyboard, and it also has a camera and mic built in for Skype use (I assume - I do not have one of those TVs).

Thanks to my local store with the \"big red circle with the dot inside\" and their price matching policy I walked out of the store with the television after paying only $435.  Nice!  It was easy to set up.  I called Samsung customer service and the rep walked me through the whole process, taking less than 5 minutes, and I was up and running.  I also purchased a ZVOX 220 Sound Base from Amazon ZVOX 4002201 Audio Z-Base 220 Low-Profile Single Cabinet Sound System and the two together are a fantastic pairing!

Good TV, good price, decent apps, easy set-up.  Note: The \"HDMI Black Level\" can not be set to \"Low\" per the settings recommendation from Gordon as my cable company (RCN) only transmits in 1080i.

The first unit had a cracked screen and just one Email got another unit on the third day. It is very easy to set up with your router/wireless system (I'm 64 and not computer savvy) for internet use. Another reviewers numbers for setting the picture worked great..This replaced a Sony CRT and the only disappointment is the sound which is really weak. It does have an optical out on the back for a soundbar so I'm researching that. Make sure you know your full system or you may not be able to connect the soundbar/home theater you have. I've watched movies off the net and it works well although you don't get them in HD. I did a lot of research on features and price before buying and feel I got the best value for the price. I'm patient enough to wait for a good deal on a soundbar/home theater system to improve the sound or I may get used to it.The Samsung site does not give you any compatibility charts for the TV and soundbars.8-29-13 I had trouble find a reasonable cost home theater system and bought four months ago one based on another reviewer's write up of the Sony HT-CT150 which is a great buy and a great sound system. Today I discovered that if I use both hook ups to the TV I can lose the volume control capabilty. I had to disconnect the HDMI cable from the Sony to the TV leaving the digital optical cable as the sole hook up.. The digital optical cord that comes with the Sony is actually better sounding by itself. I had hooked up both for the best connection. The bottom line is Samsung has had some trouble with their HDMI connections to theater systems. So please be aware of that when shopping. I Emailed Samsung while researching systems and they responded they have systems for 3D TV's. Mine is not 3D. Today I would advise the purchase of the TV as a good buy, but would give the caveat that the sound is weak and to shop for sound bars/systems that rely on optical hook ups.", "Date": "April 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the Money", "Author": "Mary Rulli", "ReviewID": "R14PU4FXA34QYK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We have purchased Samsung TV's before and liked the quality.

The glitches are as follows: a few times the TV didn't want to connect to wifi- the simple solution was to turn it off and back on and it works normal again. The TV also adjusts to the brightness in the room which is great but sometimes at an odd daylight hour it adjusts up and down for a good 30 seconds.  The only real complaint is the remote, which could have been redesigned for the smart tv capabilities.

It takes longer than I expected to start the Smart menu, but once in it the menus and text entries are very responsive.  I have been very happy with many of them.  WIFI is seamless.  Sound is OK, not great but good.  It is better than I expected it to be but I use it in a kitchen where sound quality is not quite as critical as it would be in a living room.  Remote is laid out well and works nice.  If you watch the Samsung marketing info about smart TVs, ignore the social media stuff with interactive camera and motion sensing actions.  This TV does not have that (you have to go up in size and model to get it).  I knew that before buying, but when shopping some places never distinguished between smart features on the Samsung models.Cons:  Youtube app does not work with the keyboard I put on the TV.  Not horrible, but not as convenient either.  Web app does not stream many video files (not flash compatible).  This is very disappointing.  Many popular sites with video do not work.  Cannot uninstall some apps that I don't use or plan to use.  The TV itself is very thick for an LED TV.  It seems obvious that Samsung used an older shell to put this TV in.  It doesn't matter where I installed it, but newer models are much thinner.Overall this is a pretty nice TV.  It is not perfect, but the smart functions work pretty well and are pretty convenient for the most part.  I would buy this TV again and would recommend it also.  Picture quality is very good.  I have not played with the phone app to control this much yet.

The picture of this HDTV is outstanding and the sound from the small speakers is clear unlike most small HDTVs in this size. Given the light weight of this HDTV, I have mounted it on a Humanscale M8 monitor arm with the optional Humanscale 200X200 vesa adaptor plate. It makes for a very versatile installation that can be easily repositioned for other viewing angles.The standard base seems to be poorly designed and could be broken if proper care is not exercised during both installation and every day use.I input analog video from my home security camera system DVR into the composite video input port and set the picture mode to 'movie' and the picture is sharp and clear. My cameras are high resolution (540 lines) Bosch cameras with mechanical IR filters and the displayed imagery both day and night is perfect.I just started using the Smart Apps and the Netflix streaming is very, very good.HDMI input (Dec 2012): connected a new Lenovo desktop PC via the HDMI port. Functionality is exceptional, crisp clear text and smooth YouTube video. As I use this HDTV on a desktop, I haven't experienced any issues with the speakers that may others may experience in a large, open room.Future addition:  I may also add the optional Samsung Skype camera if interest warrants from other family members.I wish this Samsung model had PiP (Picture in Picture) mode where I could watch HDTV with a small live video box for the security camera video or vice-versa.

After speaking to several Samsung customer service reps and having them fix it remotely 3 times, it now seems to be functioning without problems.From the mouth of 2 different Samsung people, they just updated their servers recently and thousands of people have been having issues with their TVs connecting to the server. The reps can fix it for you, remotely (via updating your software through their system or something) and it may be a problem for the next couple of weeks. However, they have assured me that in 2 or 3 weeks I should not have any problems connecting to the server and that is when they expect everything to be fully functional again.So if you don't mind that you may have connectivity issues, I say go for it. And if you do mind, but really want this model, then just wait 3 weeks or so and I guess you won't have any problems.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW:This whole purchase was an ordeal. First they sent me a tv that had a 12 inch crack on the screen. The box was in perfect condition, so someone had just packaged it severely damaged. Amazon was good about replacing it though, and I got a second tv 2 days later.Setting up the TV:Upon turning it on and setting the date, time, etc. I was prompted to install an update from the Samsung server. I accepted and it updated. All looked good until I tried to go to one of the Smart Hub apps preinstalled on the TV. NONE of them worked. It was essentially saying the TV was not connected to the internet, but when I checked the internet settings on the TV,  they all confirmed that I was indeed connected to the internet.I called the Samsung customer support who was on the phone with me for an HOUR AND A HALF also trying to figure out the problem. She said that even though the TV tells you to update as soon as you turn it on, if you do it, it messes everything up, so you're supposed to ignore it. How we're supposed to know that I have no idea. She took remote access of the TV (which was pretty cool) and tried a bunch of different things, but ultimately ended up installing an Albanian update and then restarting with a United States update to get a clean slate. Finally it worked.I watched Netflix for about half an hour before I went to bed and was satisfied. Until today when I woke up and tried to access it again and received an error message \"Network not connected (MODEL_ERROR_BIND). After several attempts at resetting both the router and the TV, I got the same error message and nothing on the Smart Hub would open. I could have still used the TV function if I had cable, but I don't. The only reason I got this TV was to use Netflix, Amazon instant video, and such.I searched the Internet and discovered that this particular error message means that the Samsung servers are currently down. And the Smart Hub will only work when the Samsung servers are fully operational. There is nothing you can do to fix it. You just have to sit and wait patiently for them to fix the servers. And by the looks of things, it could take several days.So if you want to be able to use your Smart TV features any time you want, don't buy this TV. According to other reports, this is at least the 2nd or 3rd time this year that the servers have been down. It's completely unreliable. Now since I don't have cable, I have a TV that can play DVDs from my DVD player and that's about it. It's essentially useless. If you want a Smart TV, I would recommend a different company.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "solid samsung again", "Author": "penlight", "ReviewID": "R2N5C0XQR831DL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own many samsung monitors and TVs. they have been solid for 5+ years.

Home-screen icons are set in stone. There is NO customizing and the screen is cluttered with a bunch of icons I never use and would prefer to be able to delete. The huge ones in the middle cannot be changed either.  This matters greatly if you, like me use your smart tv to watch Netflix & Amazon and Youtube shows and don't use cable television.2.

After watching HDTV at some friends' and relatives' houses, we were never really that gung-ho about picture quality on their HD-TVs, so we'd held out for a long time. However, our cable company kept moving more analog channels to digital only, so we eventually decided we needed one (our cable company charges an unacceptable $25/mo/tv for converter boxes). We went with this TV because it was reasonably priced and had reasonable features for our desires (we're really not that interested in 3D, for example).When I connected this TV and tuned in an HD signal, I was stunned at the high quality of the picture. It blows away everything we have seen before in other households.  We were totally STUNNED by the high quality of the picture!We had no problems connecting to our Netflix and Amazon Prime accounts through the Samsung \"SmartCenter\" apps (it's great not to need the extra Roku remote in our living room anymore!), and a Chromecast device (which we also splurged on) also works just fine. Many other apps are available through the SmartCenter, and if they work as well as Netflix and Amazon Prime, then we'll continue to enjoy the SmartCenter.So why only 4 stars?  1) The Samsung SmartCenter interface is a bit buggy. Occasionally, an app won't start up the first time (complete with error code), but has always started up the second time. The interface sometimes won't show anything but one icon (usually the PIP tv signal) ... also fixable through pretending to select something (that you can't see) and then cancelling your selection. On a TV, these are just annoyances that you can get past (it's not a car or a computer, after all). Especially at the price point of this TV.  2) The \"virtual\" keyboard on the SmartCenter apps is laid out QWERTY style. Probably good with an attached keyboard, but all we have is the remote. While I can type quickly on a QWERTY keyboard, using the remote's resulting \"hunt and peck\" style is actually a bit convoluted ... perhaps I'll get accustomed to it, but it would be nice to find a way to go to an alphabetized layout (I searched for this, but could not find it).  3) The remote itself ... ugh. All of our family members find the layout unintuitive and often hit buttons we don't intend to press. Again, perhaps something we'll adjust to, but I rather suspect there was very little user interface testing on this thing.  4) The TV shipped with a minimal manual (basically just a \"getting started\" manual). Since a (related?) manual  is available on-line through the Samsung website, this is not a deal breaker, but it is annoying. Yes, there's \"interactive\" help available on the TV itself as you navigate to certain points ... but you first have to navigate to those points, which can be a challenge (especially when you are trying to figure something out in the first place). As a result of the lack of printed documentation, I'm still not sure of the (lacking?) capabilities of the TV.  Would I buy this again? Yes. But if you're someone who wants a completely clean, bug free, easy to use UI ... you might want to shell out a little more cash and look elsewhere. For us, it's a TV with fantastic picture quality and other bonuses - essentially more than we expected.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "More than we bargained for!", "Author": "JMN \"Bargain-seeker\"", "ReviewID": "RYY1AZ89BRZG9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had planned to purchase this TV and figured the price might go down a little during black friday week.

Great picture quality, Smart TV controls work flawlessly, install & setup was a breeze, mounted easily to the wall, sound is more-than-sufficient for me, etc.  A couple years ago we had moved to a more rural area.  We do not purchase cable TV services, but our antenna would not pick up channels here as it did closer to \"town.\"  We chalked it up to living further out and had planned to purchase additional/stronger/more appropriate equipment to deal with that problem at a later time but just hadn't gotten around to it.  When I set this up I plugged in the coax cable that ran to our antenna just so it wasn't dangling there.  Did a channel scan and couldn't believe my eyes when some channels popped up and came in clearly.  After my husband played around with our antenna, we have been able to get 20+ channels on this thing, whereas we had tried all sorts of things on our other TVs, to no avail (mind you they had worked closer while in town so we knew they were functional.)

I had no problem connecting the TV to the internet through wi-fi, but the TV could not connect to the Samsung servers, thus no Smart Hub. The most common error message I got was \"ERROR_EXE_001.\" I live-chatted with a Samsung tech and was directed to manually change the DNS server settings to 8.8.8.8. This didn't help. I power cycled the system (several times). No help. Reset to factory defaults. No help. Verified that my firmware was up to date. No help. Disabled the firewall on my router. No help. Opened a ticket with Samsung giving them details of all the stuff I'd already tried. They suggested I login to the Smart Hub! I had to write again saying that that was my problem, I couldn't login to the Smart Hub. Got another message asking for answers to a series of questions. I supplied the info (including screen shots of the TV) then got a response saying my case had been sent to \"tier 2\" techs and that they would contact me in a couple days. No one contacted me.

I run a Plex server in my home, and the Plex App is available on this TV, it allows me to seamlessly access my entire library of digital media directly through my TV and Remote.  Other Apps I've used are the Amazon Instant Video & Netflix Apps.

The last one I owned was purchased in 2004, and it quickly developed large dark spots across the screen in areas where it had come into contact with sunlight from my windows. It was so bothersome that on certain programs it was so dark you couldn't even see the picture at all in the most affected areas. Not to mention, after watching a show on any news channel, the network logo would burn into the screen and would stay there for several days. Needless to say, I had sworn off buying Samsung televisions after that. However, after a friend had purchased this tv; I was impressed with the quality, which was a vast improvement from the Samsung television that I owned. As my tv deteriorated further I began to research new LED TVs online, and due to the fact that I had seen this tv in use personally I settled on the Samsung UN32EH5300 1080p 32in 60 Hz LED HDTV. I have been extremely satisfied with this purchase; compared to my previous tv, it's like night and day. No issues with sunlight damaging the picture and no issues with channel logos burning into the screen after only 30 mins of television! Overall, I love this tv, 10/10.

But the \"smart\" part leaves much to be desired.Others have mentioned the clunky interface.  Let me say very clunky.  Compared to my Windows Media Center PC, it's awful.  It's frequently slow to load - like 1990's slow.  Early 1990's with a bunch of bloatware and spyware.  Finding things is insane.  I have yet to find a global search.  Even the searches I found are lacking.  For example, I looked for the TV series, \"Arrow\".  Found it and a brief description.  But could not find what channel or when it would be on.  Watching Youtube videos is also terrible - it hangs up frequently.  I think this may be due to the fact that it keeps dropping my network connection.  Thought it might just be wifi, so I ran a cable to it.  Nah - it dropped just as frequently.  It's nice that it can see my PC, though that was a pain to set up, but sorting through my avi collection is impossible.  It ignores my folder so I have to painfully scroll through hundreds of files to get to the one I want.  And, again, no search that I could find.Overall, I'd say the hardware is decent - sound isn't bad, though I'm not an audiophile.  But the software is so awful that I can't give it more than 1 star.  Very disappointed with Samsung in this - I normally love their products.  Also disappointed with the reviews on Amazon: I mean, come on, guys - how can so many of you put up with this horrible interface?  I guess you must just not know any better.  Go buy a TV card (Hauppage is good) and try Windows Media Center.  I'm not a Microsoft fan, but it's in another league from Samsung's software here.Last thing I'd like to say is: I wish I could throw Linux on the TV.  That would improve things immensely.  Maybe someday someone will post the howto.UPDATE: Samsung has steadily released updates and I must report things have improved a bit.  I still don't care for it, but it's faster, doesn't drop the network quite as often, and the interface for searching through avis on my PC has improved to a usable state.  Adding a second star.UPDATE 2: Samsung has continued to improve things to the point that I am now willing to give this TV 4 stars.  It no longer drops the network at all, I can easily find the avi's on my PC and it plays them reliably, and the Youtube extension has improved a lot as well.

I did follow some of the recommended settings and tweaked things a bit... This has improved image quality (I'm not receiving a true HD signal from COMCAST, so this might be part of the reason the display doesn't thrill...

Tuning my DVR to a broadcast in 720... the display looks much much nicer. User error.Anyway, the black level is not uniform across screen. First unit I received had obvious defect in screen fabrication. Two dark spots in the middle of the screen where the backlight was not uniform. The SMART aspect of the TV? Jury is out with me. I'm greatly dismayed the keyboard (I'm using the Logitech K400 - works some places but not in NetFlix nor YouTube, nor Amazon Instant Video) integration is so poor. Oh how using a remote to cursor over a keyboard gets very old, very fast. Samsung should fix this. I don't find the quality of the SMART Apps up to expectations because of this.Update: the web-browser on the TV is acceptable for most things. The keyboard works very nicely in that app, but there is an annoying pop-up keyboard one can use with the remote. Wish that could be shut off.Many settings are ghosted. Like the online manual? I think they needed to use the memory for apps or for a firmware update.

It was a family affair mom was looking on Dad and I were working together and we set up our first HDTV. The joy/anticipation ended here, when we turned on our NEW TV a huge white blotch was seen on the screen with cracks around. (No Biggie I thought I'll request another)THIS IS WHERE MY NIGHT CHANGED. There was no option to replace item only refund. No problem I thought, must be a mistake I will call representative. Got a representative on the phone was informed of the same option (how convenient). All I wanted was for Amazon to pick up item and send new TV when in stock, conveniently they're unable to do so. SAMSUNG was contacted and they flat out refused to send new tv as this damage isn't covered in THEIR  warranty (SO SAMSUNG WHAT THE HELL DO YOU COVER IN YOUR ONE YEAR WARRANTY) Now they're gonna contact the company I purchased external warranty through to see my options, who knows what I'll hear then.

Roku returns you the location of the show you were last viewing and connects within a couple of seconds.  The top level application panel spreads the icons across the screen, with lots of blank space, forcing you to scroll to multiple screens to reach a small number of channels, further increasing the time and effort to find what you are looking for.  The Samsung hub allows me to view 10 channels on a 40\" screen which is a third less than the 15 channels I can see with my Roku on an old 22\" analog TV set.

The built in smart hub is just ok.  It seems to run apps fine and you have a fairly wide selection though nothing like the google app store for variety, but the major apps seem to be there (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Instant video, Plex, etc).  The apps that stream video seem to work fine but one big thing missing is a youtube app, instead you get a shortcut on the desktop to the youtube website.  This is kind of ok except the built in browser leaves a lot to be desired, and the youtube web page does not seem to support pairing to a mobile device like the app would.  The processor seems to really struggle to run the browser and pretty much any website with flash will crash the browser.  Using the remote to navigate the browsers onscreen keyboard is incredibly tedious so instead just buy a cheap wireless logitech mouse and plug in the nano adapter to the usb port.  The mouse installs itself automatically and makes using the onscreen keyboard fast and easy.

I was able to see recent items viewed and recommendation for other selections.  I also found a Samsung App account of someone else on the set.  That was easy to sign out of.  I might have been tempted to use the other person's account, but I have no interest in it at this time.  I have seen no other tracks of other folks hiding in the on board browser, and do not expect trouble, but it was a surprise to find any.  I wonder how many people used the TV before I got it.

However, even with disabling all automatic background lighting options this TV has some very annoying characteristics.  In an outdoor night scene with a house with light coming through the windows and a car driving up, the backlighting increases to increase the brightness of the car headlights as they come into view. This results in the lights in the windows of the house to brighten also, a very obvious error in realistic scene reproduction.  Backlighting of the whole screen results from changes in overall scene brightness and if you are accessing the menu or program directory, they will vary drastically in brightness following the average brightness of the scene.The web browser is very limited and is unstable, crashes frequently.Product support is at this point impossible to obtain.  After calling Samsung and the support person answering not able to answer any questions about the product transferred me to a recording that asked me to hang up and call back at another time.  I never did get my problems addressed.This is the only \"Smart TV\" I've ever owned so I don't have anything to compare it to.

There is space for three HDMI ports in the back, I only need to utilize one of them as I mentioned my AV receiver does the rest.  I will not talk about the sound quality as I only did a basic plug-and-play while setting up.  Now that my AV unit is in, that is what I use for the sound.There seem to be a lot of features for use with wireless.  The wireless was extremely easy to setup and actually picks up more signals than my desktop, which is surprising.  Very simple process to set that up, but this feature I also do not use since I have Apple TV.It is not that heavy, so it will be fairly easy for weak people to pick it up and set it where they want (as long as you aren't wall mounting, I just used the stand)Really, no complaints.

On one hand, why not buy a bigger TV, on another hand, I could buy a $350 TV right away, and with a bigger one I would have to wait.

It's easy to operate, it has 2 USB ports, and my external drive works perfectly with it. It reads and plays all my movies fine, and I like it that it properly displays that file system om my external drive.I don't have cable, so I use it only for watching movies. It can be used to browse internet, but I am not interested in doing that, I would rather use a laptop. I had no problems connecting it to my WiFi, and there is no delay in displaying. I am a Prime Amazon member, so now I can watch HD movies for free! What a treat!My only suggestion is that I could set up the view of my interactive screen, cause it has lots of stuff (kids, fitness, whatever) that I don't need, and there is no way to customize it. Also, what I am not sure I like, I would like to have an option for TV to start where I turned it off. Since I don't have cable, and, frankly, mostly use my TV to watch movies on Amazon (or movies from my external drive), I am kind of annoyed that it always starts trying to find signal and displaying white noise. Then I have to load an interactive panel, once again, navigate to Amazon app, wait for it to load. What would be nice is to turn the TV on and just have my Amazon app already loaded.Also, an on-board DVD player would definitely help with this model, but I am just being picky here.

It's just annoying, and seems to be active for every button pushed on the remote. Don't purchase a smart TV unless the \"smart\" part can be physically updated. I now question my sanity of purchasing a smart TV at all. A larger dumb TV display and a Roku would have been a better solution, and will be what I do next time.

Since I don't care about the \"smart\" part of the smart t.v., the issue that came up didn't really bother me, but it would certainly bother someone else.Anyway, I'll just get right to the problem.  My t.v. appears to have a bug where, after the initial update, it pops up a big message on the screen (about every 30 mins or so, I think) that says \"new update found please turn off the power and then back on to perform the update.\"  Keep in mind that restarting the t.v. doesn't actually fix the message, and it will continue to pop up in the MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN BLOCKING A HUGE PORTION OF WHATEVER I'M WATCHING!But my review is still overall positive, so how did I fix this?  Well, I turned off the wifi (well, I made it try to connect to a fake network).  See, I use apple t.v. for my internet viewing anyway, so I don't even NEED the internet stuff inside the t.v..  It's likely 90% of the people who are going out of their way to get a smart t.v. would care a lot more than I do about this bug, but hey, it's not affecting me that much now that I found a way around that annoying message.Couple that with my first Samsung UN32EH5300 coming in broken (that was UPS's fault though, not Samsung or Amazon), and I really should be more upset; but it's a really nice t.v. overall.I'd say, if you're not afraid of debugging your t.v. (I never thought I'd say that...) then hey, go for it!  This is a really great looking t.v., especially for the price.

There is not much else to say here, because I'm not much interested on how \"smart\" a TV is; I simply want a great picture.

At about 45 degrees, forget about it! Not sure if viewing distance is a factor.So, unless you're a hermit and or a complete loner who always watches TV alone, or only plays games on this TV alone, you will often notice the quality of the picture take a serious nose-dive as soon as you stand up to go to the kitchen or lean over to whisper sweet nothings into your girlfriend's ear.I'm giving it a generous 3 stars because, like I said, if you're watching head-on it's easily a 5 star rating from me.I will be returning this LED set once my Panasonic is fixed.

The picture quality is good and there are four different selections to choose from to tweak it to your liking, including an automatic setting to accomodate the light in the room.  It lacks what larger TV's can do - which is really make the viewing experience great - so it is best in a smaller room (the 32\").  I bought it for my living room and since I don't watch that much tv as I'm out of the house most days, it's good for me.I did find out that if you try watching at an angle from about ten feet away, you could be disappointed.  The smart features work for the most part but sometimes they don't - maybe because it is still new - but it can get stuck and not connect.  I am hoping this goes away.  Most of the time, though it works fine and connects via Wi-fi.Setting up was pretty simple and intuitive.  I still have not been able to use my phone to do the remote because i have an iphone - but if you have a samsung phone you probably can.  Using the onscreen keyboard is a little annoying at first as you have to use the arrow buttons to move around the keyboard instead of being able to press the letter you want (the remote does not have a keyboard built in).  Also - I was disappointed that in order to watch Hulu on the Tv, I had to have a Hulu Plus subscription.  It's not a big deal at $7.99 a month but the free version offers just as much but can only be watched on my pc, not the TV.There are lots of great apps that I haven't had the chance to check out yet - but think this will last many years in which i have to use them.

My wireless router was set up for N+G, WPA2-AES, hidden SSID, and an over 50 character passkey. After hours of troubleshooting I started reading the forums and someone mentioned to try wireless G only. I configure my router for wireless G only and wala, it finally connects to my wireless network with a healthy working connection. So, sadly this is a top of the line new Smart TV that is using an old networking technology. Because of this TV I had to downgrade my wireless speed for ALL my devices down to G. I will now probably have to buy a 2nd router just for this TV to use G and my other devices to use N. This is the first device I buy that needs to use the \"wireless G only\" setting on my router. All other devices even if they had G cards/adapters would work fine with the G or N setting on the router.Also, the TV takes a while to start up networking related aspects such as Netflix, and it freezes a lot doing updates. This is not due to my internet speed because I have a 30 meg connection from my ISP. Trying to access the web feature, it froze and I had to reboot it just to get it working again. I also find the Netflix more enjoyable on the Sony dvd/blu-ray players and Apple TV. I've noticed issues with Netflix sound and audio/video not matching. I hope Samsung releases updates for this TV that will clean up the networking issues.

I finally had a guy hang the damn tv on my wall mount (which I also bought on Amazon for wayyy cheaper compared to Home Depot) and it broke. Like no power, nothing. I called Samsung and they outsource their tech support to somewhere in China. IDK what the guy was saying - it was a disaster. He did troubleshooting (same stuff I already did on my own b/c I have a brain) and then was like ok, you are covered under warranty (I better be! I've only had this thing for 2 months) so we are going to send tech support out to you in 2 wks. UGH. I had to go out of town etc... Tech support came, replaced the power source inside the tv and it worked fine. Now I'm worries a major piece of the tv is going to randomly break again and I'm going to be out 400-500 bucks. The tech guy told me if it wasn't covered under warranty that it would cost about about $400 ish to repair it on my own aka the price of the damn tv! He said that Samsung is so worried about offering newer technology with its SmartTV's and because of that are using s***ty parts.  AND SAMSUNG IS SUPPOSE TO BE LIKE THE BEST BRAND EVER. The guy told me next time go with Toshiba. I actually have a Toshiba 40 inch regular flatscreen that hasn't had ANY issues for almost 4 yrs. And I've moved 3 times with it... GO FIGURE!  Now that the tv works, its cool. Sometimes Samsung's system or servers or something is down and I can't stream netflix, which blows my mind.

I am able to watch my shows without worrying that someone else on my Netflix account has \"lost my place.\"  The app on the TV does not differentiate between users on the same Netflix account.

It is not reinforced along the backbone with bends to keep it from being susceptible to vibrations from the *speaker ports* and wall mounts caused by the lower mounted speakers.  Samsung UN46EH5300 46-Inch 1080p 60Hz LED HDTV (Black)The Packaging:My Samsung was in great condition and was easy to unpack and the assemble was well documented and straight fwd. Items were easy to identify and the hardest part for me was getting the plastic off the batteries. TRUE.The Picture:Out of the box the unit was satisfactory in color and richness, I only changed the back lighting up a bit to overcome some ambient window light. On standard satellite (non HD) it's default setting to to display content 16:9 thus cutting and fattening the aspect. There is a P-Size button on the remote for ease of adjustment.  PS3 video gaming was just as clear as on my other HDTV, yet I had to use the P-Size button to get aspect correct.  Over the air digital TV reception showed off the picture and GUI.  I do like the info button and the 'Ch List' gave each channel a 'now on' schedule. Viewing movies off a small 8 GB USB as well as a large 500 GB was enjoyable and due to the movies on the USB devices being HD 1920x1080 it made the time watching relaxing.The Sound:  Depending on my source material the sound was adequate. I used both the built in speakers (noting the back panel vibration) as well as the SPDIF to amp digital.  *From my experiment using Frequency Test via YouTube, I found the range of the builtin speakers to be from 75Hz to 12000Hz.  My back panel would rattle @ 180Hz ~ 240Hz causing annoying hum to be added to the distinguishable sound perception.* The video show a bandaid fluttering at the left speaker port with my HDTV volume up to 80. I have resolved my vibration by adding layers of electrical tape between the rub points on the Wall Mounts, and added two triangular wedges of memory foam directly above the speakers.* Remote has 'Tools' button to get quick access to sound and video adjustment. Would have been nice it aspect P-Size, had been placed there as well.The Stand:Actually the stand was a little trouble assembling. Oval base had to be assembled to an arm, then the two piece stand attached to the slotted back of the HDTV. The stand has a small footprint and even though the HDTV is light by comparison to my 47\" Westinghouse, it still wobbles. IE. put your finger on the upper bezel of the TV and poke it.  This causes shake, the TV will rock back and forth 4 times till steady. This comment brings me to the stability of unit in general, as the unit is light yet it is not STURDY.  I noticed while playing my PS3 during music cut scenes that there was an added sound during the playing of the music, upon further inspection I found by placing my index finger on the vents of the back panel, a very noticeable vibration. Volume on TV was set at 28 and it was not at a level to annoy or be noticed by ppl in an adjacent room. I decided to inspect the immediate inside of the HDTV by removing 8 (M) labeled screws and 3 (B) labeled screws. Power and all connections removed I took the back panel off and took pictures of the two circuit boards, and the whole back, and of the labels.  What I found was that the 400 x 400 wall mount brackets that are mounted to the inner panel are manufactured and mounted in such a manner that they are noticeably loose by design. Each of the four mounts have a lower angular tab that right angle latched/mate to the inner panel and are then screwed into place by a single phillips-head screws.  There exists a gap and wiggle room due to these mounts, it appear to be aluminum against aluminum and the space (intended/unintended) is not padded thus causing vibration points. Two of these mounts are direction above the lower mounted speaker and thus explain my audible and tactile sensation. If I am able * Picture now attached to user images* to attach the picture (hint Amazon) I will.Peripherals:As other reviewer have noted the Samsung UN46EH5300F remote is a huge hassle to browse the web and type with. There is no intuitive (Snap Too) on the prompts, and the Text entry navigation with the remote is painfully awkward.  The Samsung would not detect (if detected, the system will display in a PIP) my Logitech S510 wireless keyboard/mouse.  Yet it did find a 9 year old Logitech USB gaming mouse, and a Westing Technology PS3 wireless keyboard.The system under the Menu>System>Device Manager allows for some very basic adjustments to your device.  IE language, speed, pointer size.Overall:I am underwhelmed with this purchase and will be carefully considering the vibration as a precursor to overall satisfaction and durability. On the weekday I will contact Samsung's Call Center to see how eager they are to remote manage into my TV (Menu>Support>Remote Management) to introduce a beta driver for my Logitech S510.3 Stars till~~~~~~~~~~~~-1 for vibration-1 for Peripheral not recognized.", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Do not buy this Smart TV if you want to be able to password protect the Web Browser app.", "Author": "Probably Cam", "ReviewID": "R311W05B7P3N9T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The TV works and looks great.  But I returned it because the Smart TV software is riddled with issues, even after updating to the latest version and working with Samsung tech support.I bought the 40\" Samsung UN40EH5300 Smart TV for my wife for her birthday.  The whole family was excited to set it up and get it working.  The Smart TV software detected our network, prompted me for our security passcode, and connected effortlessly.  We were browsing the web and streaming HD video from Netflix in just a few minutes.Throughout the day, however, the Smart TV software kept forgetting our network passcode, and I had to keep re-typing it to proceed.  Maybe this would settle down over time.  I wasn't willing to find out since it made using the Smart TV features a real pain, and it doesn't feel very stable so even if it self corrects, I'm worried about it breaking again in the future.The Smart TV has an impressive level of parental controls over which TV and movie ratings it will allow.  Parents can override this at any time via a 4 digit PIN if they want to watch something that's blocked.  Also, you can lock _nearly_ any app on the Smart TV screen so it also requires the PIN to gain access.  However, you cannot lock the Web Browser app!  Nor can you remove it or delete it.  I find this brain dead and unacceptable.  Why give me all these parental control features when right next to the Kids Games app (which can be locked), there's a Web Browser app that cannot be locked.  Is this my TV or not?The Smart Hub app, which is always on and serving up ads I don't want to see, also cannot be locked.  I can understand why Samsung would not want me to disable the Smart Hub app, and I could live with that if I could at least lock the Web Browser, so I consider the always-on Smart Hub app merely irritating.My kids often watch Netflix \"Just for Kids\", or the kids version of Amazon Instant, on the Wii or PS3.  Neither of these apps are available in the Samsung apps store.  I want to be able to let my 5 year old turn on the TV and go to her familiar \"Just for Kids\" interface, but I cannot with our brand new Smart TV.  We resorted to hooking up the Wii with its lower resolution so she could safely stream her shows from there without having to navigate around mom and dad's shows, but hooking up the Wii to watch Netflix pretty much defeats the purpose of getting a Smart TV.Another minor irritation: whenever you turn on the TV, a \"connecting\" icon spins in the upper right hand corner of the screen before you can do anything with the TV, even if all you want to do is watch TV or access the DVD player.  The \"connect\" time varies, but it sometimes takes nearly a minute.  Why does the TV assume whenever I fire up the TV I want to use the Smart TV features?  Instead, it should load those in the background.I'm returning this TV and will never buy a Smart TV again, since those features seem to take over the TV.  I'm getting a dumb TV instead (the VIZIO E Series E470-A0 47-Inch 1080p 60Hz LED-Lit HDTV) and I'll connect a gaming console or video streaming box for Netflix and the like, one that allows me to choose what I want in my living room, not what someone thinks I should have.For an example of Samsung's attitude on allowing consumers the freedom to lock and unlock what they want, see this thread I found online from a couple years back:############################################################ How to de-junk Smart Hub / Smart TV# by leopold55# Hi, does anyone know how to get rid of all the junk in the Samsung \"Smart Hub\".## I can see that you can uninstall some of the \"Apps\", but what about the ones on the# top half of the screen?## Yahoo, LoveFilm, & all the other video on demand. \"Your Video\", is particularly# annoying because it's not my video, it's yet another v-o-d service.## Would be fine to ignore if I didn't have young kids, who I want to be able to use# the TV, but shouldn't be exposed to some of this stuff - even the covers and# meta-data for these are potentially inappropriate.## As for the Samsung Apps - we'll they're mostly very poor, but again, I don't want my# kids just downloading rubbish games or surfing inappropriate YouTube stuff.####################################################################################################################### How to de-junk Smart Hub / Smart TV# by Samsung_HD_Tech# In Reply to: How to de-junk Smart Hub / Smart TV by leopold55## leopold55,## The \"Recommended\" Apps are part of the App package.

Mittner", "ReviewID": "R305IIG3YQFC8K", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Before looking too much into the 3-star rating either way, understand my frame of reference. For years we've only had a single television in our living room; a 50\" Samsung with a PS3 plugged in, serving as our media hub for Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and streaming from my NAS over DLNA. So when I judge the 5300 it's largely in comparison to that experience.When going to buy two 30-something inch televisions for our bedroom and office I didn't even consider a \"Smart\" TV. The plan was to get a couple Chromecasts and just stream to them from whatever device was handy. So when I saw the 5300 on a Cyber-Monday deal I jumped on it. Having built-in wifi and all our apps was very appealing. We barely ever watch conventional television so it had everything we'd need. But ultimately the experience isn't quite the same, and not quite as good, as the TV+PS3 combination.Keeping State:You spend the time to dig through the menus and start streaming a video over DLNA or Netflix and turn off the television, you have to dig yourself all the way back to resume where you left off. Obviously this wasn't a problem for us before, so long as we didn't turn off the PS3. With Smart TVs having to compete with that alternative setup I'd have expected a bit better handling of this; either put the viewer back where they left off or give them a suspend mode alternative to turning it off.DLNA:Decent, but not as good as the PS3's. It doesn't work correctly with any of our Windows DLNA servers nor did it work with MediaTomb running off my Linksys NAS. Fortunately (sort of) I was able to change my NAS to using an inferior DLNA server application. The 5300 is able to use that one, at least. Now I just have to deal with that applications shortcomings.PS3 Controller better than Remote:My 3 year old can navigate my PS3 into Netflix and find his shows. I suspect it'll be a year or two before he can properly wield the remote and make it through MediaHub. This is made worse by the fact it doesn't keep state. We have to set him up every time he wants to watch his shows, even if he was the last one using it.Less of a comparison to my current setup now...Uninstallable Apps:Some things you can delete, some things you can't. The result is a slew of applications you just can't get off the interface. The \"bottom\" ones you can throw into a folder which kind of works, but the \"top\" recommended ones you're just stuck with. Fortunately for us we at least use most of them, anyway...Ads:Seriously? I go into MediaHub on my television and have to deal with ads?Snowy Startup:Using exclusively on-demand services we don't have any input sources, so every time we turn the TV on we get a snow field on the screen straight out of the 50s. And I haven't yet found a way to have it go into MediaHub by default. I'd have expected they'd anticipate this use case and not force everyone to an input source that doesn't exist...All that being said, it's still a good television and still better than my original plan of relying on a Chromecast exclusively--though I'm tempted to plug a couple in if only to get rid of the default static screen on start up.

This is a 60hz TV and NOT 120hz.Changing from one cable channel to the next takes 2 - 5 seconds (skipping ahead 15-20 channels takes about 90 seconds - This definately kills channel surfing unless you have 60 minutes to cycle through your channels)depending on the picture resolution of the next channel.Advertized prominately is connecting a hard drive to the TV to show your family photos.

And they do not explicitly tell you this until there is a problem that cannot be fixed.We bought this TV during the Black Friday Sale for $600.  We chose to buy it from Tiger Direct because we studied the return & exchange policies on Tiger Direct's profile page prior to the purchase, and everything seemed fine at the time.  We also chose this seller over local stores that were also selling the TV for the same price, because we trust Amazon.  A week later it arrived with a terrible fist-size crack on the screen.  We do not think the damage resulted in transit by UPS, because we have purchased many many delicate items shipped by UPS with no problem at all.  Right away we contacted Amazon to file for an exchange.  All Amazon was able to do was to contact Tiger Direct on our behalf requesting for an exchange of the damaged TV.  Amazon did not mention anything about the item not being exchangeable.  3 days later we received a convoluted email from Tiger Direct:\"Due to the number of orders placed for this item against the number of stocks we have, we were unable to determine if your purchase was included in the processing priority list. This is the reason why we have not cancelled your purchase until we are able to confirm that we are unable to fill your order within the specified timeframe provided by Amazon.com. Unfortunately, our stocks were limited and we are still waiting for the manufacturer to provide us a delivery date.\"The email did not address our request for an exchange.  It does not even tell you that the item is not exchangeable.We called Samsung regarding the issue.  Samsung warranty does not cover for cracked screens.We called Tiger Direct's customer service line.  After waiting for ONE WHOLE HOUR, an exhausted and ignorant CSR took down our information for a refund, while we were asking for an exchange.  When we corrected the CSR, he told us it is policy that damaged items through Amazon can only be returned and not exchanged.  We asked to speak to a manager regarding this, CSR replied \"No you cannot because it is policy and no one can overturn that\".  When we finally got through to a manager, he reiterated that the item can only be refunded and he cannot sell us an orange where there isn't one (???).The end result is that we have wasted two weeks of our time and missed out on a good Black Friday deal from other more credible sellers.Advice:  Do not buy TV's from Tiger Direct.

Super exaggerated highlights and inconsistent colors that change from channel to channel, scene to scene and ad to ad.  I've made DOZENS of setting adjustments and spoken with Samsung six times.  Just when I think I've got it, a new ad comes on and this TV is all but un-watchable all over again.  e.g.: A picture showing a room-full of people of different ethnicities will be great, except for one person who's skin tone will be so white it practically glows, or is so washed out they look like they should be in a coffin.  Also, most channels seem to have a white haze, which dulls the picture and sharpness.  I've turned off all of the power saving settings as they seem to enhance this effect, but I still don't like it.Samsung has lot's of excuses, (if they don't hang up on me first), but it's not acceptable anyway you look at it.  (Watching the Blue-Ray player is even worse, so NO, it's not my satellite provider as Samsung suggests.  And I have other flat screen TV's that have GORGEOUS coloring and sharp pictures in my home, so I know what watching a TV should look like... even though you are doing your best to make me feel like an idiot).  I've worked hard over the past three days to get some improvement, but enough is enough and it's going back.A big thank you however to G. Peck, the reviewer who listed his settings on his review.  After copying them, there was a drastic improvement, but still not enough to make me want to keep this set.I will say that I like the sound quality of this TV, even though many did not.  On the other hand, apparently you can't have an external speaker playing in conjunction with the TV speaker.  (I have both going simultaneously with my other TV's however).  Of course I couldn't use my external speaker at all, because according to Samsung, I have the wrong cable.  It's the same cable that I had working with my SONY just seconds before, but Samsung says I need to buy a Samsung cable....  Also on the positive side, if you can call it that, the remote control is better than many I have used.  Although dull, the keys are back-lit which is nice, and MOST of the keys are thoughtfully placed.  It's all moot for me, as I use a universal remote which was incredibly easy (easier than my other electronics) to program to this TV.I will also add that I agree with the many reviewers who don't like the glossy screen.

The picture and sound quality on this was really good and much better than my tv I was replacing. The tv was considerably thicker than my older tv which I found surprising since this one is led version and my older one was lcd. Being thicker allowed it more room for the speakers, which sounded so much better than my older tv. This tv is loaded with tons of features. Its got wifi,ethernet, dln, 2 usb ports, 3 hdmi ports, a web browser and tons of apps. Its very hard these days to find a 1080p 32 inch tv. They dont make that many any more. Only Samsung and a couple of other manufactures make them now. Most tvs in the 32inch size are now 720p not 1080p. In my case I needed a 1080p since I was using it for gaming and as monitor. Also my older tv was 1080p. Overall I really liked this tv with its set of features, sound and picture quality and price. But the second day I got it I decided to take off all the plastic tape around the bezel edges and found that the bezel was extremely loose. The two top corners were loose and continued about halfway down. I really didnt feel like exchanging this one and trying to find another one. I didnt know for sure if the next one would be the same or better. I had also read on avs forums and here on amazon of others complaining of the same issue. I have had a number of issues with the Samsung products in the last 3-4 years. My first tv bought in 2008 had the clicking sound. Then Samsung replaced it in 2009 and now that one is also make the clicking sound. Ive owned 4 Samsung blu ray player which also had quality control issues. More recently I tried 3 Samsung galaxy note 10.1 tablets they all had creaking and clicking sounds. Also my recently purchased samsung galaxy s3. I had to exchange because a loose power button and other issues. Samsung makes great products, with lots of features at an affordable price. But the build quality and quality control issues make me want to purchase other products. Anyway back to the review of this tv. It was great except for the loose bezel. If you want to a tv with vga output or a swivel stand then this isnt the tv for you. I also found the power controls weird since they are on the bottom right. Just one button like a joystick allows you to control power, volume, channels, input or other settings. The tv is extremely light and the overall foot print takes up less space than my older tv. Its not as wide or not as tall but it is thicker. It makes a great tv for monitor and also has picture and picture. So you could be browsing the web and have picture and picture on and catch up on some news. In the end I realized I really missed my old tv. So I got my old tv fixed since it was cheaper than getting a new tv. So as long as you get on that doesnt have the defects mine had the loose bezel your fine. It makes a great tv for the bedroom and or as a monitor and gaming.Update after owning for 1 month: So I ended up repurchasing this tv since my repaired tv started making noises again. This tv is still the best 32 inch 1080p led  on the market. Most manufactures dont even make 1080p tvs in this size any more. This is tv is great deal if you can get it for around $400. Considering it has so many features like wifi, dlna, 2 usb ports, 3 hdmi ports, picture in picture, apps and a browser. The second tv I purchased also had a loose bezel, mostly in the top right corner. I tried tightening the screws to make the bezel less loose but it didnt help. Other than the bezel being loose I am very happy with this tv. Sound and picture quality is great. It has very small footprint which is great for the bedroom or desk. I use mine mostly as monitor with my laptop, also do some pc gaming with it, use it with my apple tv 2 and hd pvr. The tv is a little on the thicker side considering it is an led. I really like having picure and picture and being able to use my iPad to control the tv with the samsung app. The tv has tons of apps. There are a few apps I wish it had like slacker and vevo. The dlna and usb port only plays some of my mvks, plays all avi files and aac music files from itunes.

I then set up my Roku box with 720p output to compare its PQ with TV's built-in Netflix app. They look similar and both have the same jaggy and fuzzy edges when playing movies. This indicates that upscaling is causing all of these image quality issues. Of course if 1080p streaming is available on Samsung Netflix app, then the issue might disappear.A 1080p TV is considered to be \"newer\" model compared with an old 720p LCD TVs, which means people have higher expectation on the image quality for the same source. However a 720p source being displayed on 720p TV looks natural because no video scaling is required. To get comparable or similar performance, a very high quality sclaer is required when showing 720p contents on a 1080p TV because all of these pixels need to be digitally processed and up-scaled. If this is not done right, it will certainly create artifacts and image quality issues. At least in my setup, my 720p TV seems to have a much better picture quality when using Roku 720p source, compared with the same Roku 720p source on my Samsung 1080p TV. Because of upscaling, I do expect the 720p source on a 1080p display should look slightly worse than on a native 720p display, but not this bad. The amount of jaggy shows that the scaler configuration is really bad, probably just the simplest bilinear scaler.---------------- end of update ------------------------The TV has several picture quality (PQ) issues:1) In the netflix app, the resolution must be much lower than 1080p, or the scaler is using a real bad configuration. I can see big jaggy and noise in Hunger Games which should be the HD content from Netflix server. I compared this PQ with Amazon instant video app from the same TV and Amazon Instant Video PQ looks much better than Netflix. Amazon version looks more like 1080p streaming. I don't know who is responsible for low quality netflix movies, either netflix or samsung. However, since the netflix app is provided in Samsung firmware, I assume samsung should be responsible for this. In this netflix mode, the screen adjustment setting is disabled so we can't play with scaling to confirm if Netflix app is cheating us using lower resolution or not. But based on the amount jaggy and low quality image, I believe the app is not doing 1080p streaming.2) The panel has very noticeable pixel structure. I don't know why the small LEDs look so crisp clear. I do expect they blend more, with less mosaic effect. The panel looks a little bit more fuzzier than my old 720p LCD TV even though I believe the pixel density is similar.3) The compression noise reduction feature barely works. There is still a lot of mosquito noise on the edges. Even on the Netflix movie selection menu, and main menu background image, I can see a lot of noise.4) The \"dynamic\" picture mode is over-enhanced. The same for \"natural\" mode. The \"standard\" is tuned for energy saving so it looks like having low contrast. The only mode I recommend is \"movie\" mode but still there some enhancement going on even after I turned off almost all the picture adjustment functions such as noise reductions. Overall, the contrast is mess-ed up and even in its best movie mode, it is still over enhanced.The only good thing about this TV is its black level. It looks fantastic. But its video processing is creating too many problems for contents with resolution lower than 1080p. If using blu-ray, or using 1080p streaming, this TV is great.I wish the TV has a setting that can bypass most video enhancement, with a nominal scaling setup", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "Joseph OBrien", "ReviewID": "RUYOD2FOYSEAJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This TV is great in every aspect that a TV should be, however, the Smart Hub is typical Microsoft-windows-Android let down material.I bought the TV for my gym and didnt want to pay for another FIOS box.

I was going \"Huh if i have to buy a repeater and place it next to the TV I would have bought a TV that was a 100 cheaper and plunged an Ethernet cable to it.\"has a good resolution when I plugged the BluRay to it though. so if you are buying it hoping to connect to wireless dont. just pick up the Samsung LN40E550 40-Inch 1080p 60Hz LCD HDTV and save yourself money.", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Many Promises But No Firm Deliveries: GET A SONY OR WAIT FOR APPLE", "Author": "Ron Cope", "ReviewID": "RE05JRACPLT86", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Samsung promises many things for this product. The problem is that they simply don't deliver. The set is really not reliably wireless. It has to be hard wired into your wireless system. The only way I was able to get it work was to connect it directly to the LAN. Or, I got a signal booster to make it work. Also, don't think you can browse the web with this set. The software is bulky at best and at worst really non-functional. Streaming is spotty at best and the programs they offer are the best that are available now, but nearly every wireless set that promises to deliver streaming and web-browsing is promising the moon and delivering thin air. Let's face it, the software and strength of the wireless connection is not yet widely available. Samsung builds a nice picture and OK sound but not the future or otherwise in terms of a great overall experience. Plus, don't waste your time with the customer service people: they just read from a manual and are not really able to think on their feet as is sometimes needed. Plus, of course, they know their sets don't have the best software and wireless connectivity. So they \"lie\" and act as if the problem is yours not theirs. The bottom line is that right now the best you can do is buy a nice TV and don't ask it to stream and connect. That's where Apple or some other company still has an opportunity to introduce a better experience which will offer us what the companies and sets today promise but don't really deliver.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dope for TV", "Author": "c dwight", "ReviewID": "R1JZN8CIBA81FD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "TV is great for regular viewing of cable and movies but the WIRELESS INTERNET FEATURE REALLY REALLY SUCKS!!!LOLIts a great TV for the money.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Smart TVs are a waste of time (For now at least)", "Author": "Mattey", "ReviewID": "R3OVDL1RF7T9YM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have been buying most of my movies and tv shows through iTunes over the years, and one of the first things a potential SmartTV owner needs to consider is that you can't access anything from Apple's ecosystem on these devices.

I returned this and bought a 40\" Samsung LED HDTV for less, and even with the purchase of the AppleV i still saved money.Other considerations for SmartTVs  Yes they offer apps like Hulu and Netflix, but each manufacturer customizes the OS to their preferences so these App companies have an infinite number of platforms to support (Too many different flavors of Android, it's impossible to keep updates steadily streaming into the multitude of app stores).  Do not expect to get all of the bugs resolved, or even to get meaningful support, for any apps that run on a SmartTV.  They also run very slowly, and the controls are clunky.If you're an Android person you 'might be okay' with this purchase, but i have not found a single person who has been excited or even happy for the long term, for their SmartTV purchase.

But couldn't get TV to \"see\" it on the flash drive.Called tech support who said the firmware can only be updated via PC. I have a Mac. They suggested I \"borrow a friend's\" PC.Oh yes they did.Obviously this is due to a) legal issues with Samsung & Apple and b) Samsung's utter idiocy.So much for \"smart.\"", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "review", "Author": "Edwin Zayas", "ReviewID": "R142CAGFZLBVNJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "it wasnt  what I expected.I cannt connect to my laptop,yes is very much.awesome.bye now bye bye bye dont bother me writing more", "Date": "March 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "not native 1080p, color too Neon, No Netflix, and tracking built in tracking for Advertisment.", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R19TYDCK564DID", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "only 3.5 stars b/c on my computer it will not give me native 1080p as it is a 40\" and not 42\";  also color adjustment is needed which I cannot seem to get right,  Neon colors either look 'washed' or 'overly bright';  adjusting this for natural tones makes the flesh tones too natural or too red.
