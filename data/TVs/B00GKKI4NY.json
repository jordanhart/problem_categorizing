{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Spectacular TV for the price", "Author": "Donald Schultz", "ReviewID": "RQM8TWGB0M3J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:1.  Vivid and very clear picture, especially with native 1080P content.  The Smart Dimming (active LED zone dimming) feature does make a subtle improvement to the picture, so I recommend leaving it on.2.  Smart TV dock with common applications such as Amazon Instant Video, NetFlix, Hulu Plus, and more.  Also may be customized.3.  WiFi and Ethernet connectivity.  Ethernet is the preferred way since WiFi can be unreliable.4.  Nearly borderless.5.  3 HDMI connections and a whole host of analog connections.  Digital audio out (optical).6.  120 Hz.  I have not noticed significant judder.7.  Almost effortless picture tweaking by selecting \"Calibrated\" mode.  This produces the best and most natural picture for a well-lit room without over-blowing the colors.8.  Blacks are very deep, and much better than my older 42\" CCFL backlit Vizio TV.9.  Remote is very nice and feels sturdy.  Buttons are on the small side, however.Cons:1.  Picture is not going to rival a $1,500 Sony or Samsung, but the picture is still very good.2.  Viewing angles are OK for this set, but don't expect to get too far from front and center.  Washout of the colors will occur starting at more than 20 degrees from head-on horizontally, and about 40 degrees vertically.3.  No ability to adjust how the motion compensation feature works.  Older Vizio TVs allowed you to select the degree of aggressiveness of the feature.  The user's manual shows the option, but the option is not actually found in the TV menu system.4.  WiFi is only 2.4 GHz.  This is a major problem in my book.  If you intend to stream and are in a place congested with 2.4 GHz networks, you really need 5 GHz.  In my case I am using Ethernet, so it is not an issue.5.  I do notice slight judder, especially with upconverted and streaming content.  Not major, but if you look for it you will find it.Conclusion:I am very happy with my purchase.  It was a worthy upgrade from my 42\" CCFL Vizio set.  I am not using the TV internal speakers since I have sound piped out through digital optical to a sound bar.My picture settings are as follows, and I highly recommend them since I have had time to fiddle with TV:1.  When initially setting up the TV, select \"Home\" mode.  DO NOT select Retail.2.  Go into the menu, Picture settings, and then select Calibrated.  Although you will be tempted to fiddle with other picture settings....resist the temptation. I learned changing this one thing is the only adjustment you need make.Remember that you will need to select Calibrated for all inputs.  It will default to Standard picture mode (very dim and not all that vivid) when you first switch to say another HDMI port for your BluRay player.  Once you switch over to the different input, go ahead and make the change and it will remember the changes for each input.  DON'T FORGET to also make the change for the Smart TV streaming hub \"input\" as well.  It will default to Standard for that too until you change it.  I would be happy to answer questions.", "Date": "February 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Price and Performance meet Quality Control Issues", "Author": "I Am Spartachris", "ReviewID": "R30SRTH5X8Z9Q9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my first Vizio TV, and I have to say that I am impressed by the quality of the picture and the features for a set selling for this price.I have to start off by saying that I did have to have the initial set I was sent replaced due to dead pixels. Multiple dead pixels in fact. One or two dark pixels surrounded by clusters of grey pixels that were very noticeable, especially during particularly bright images. Somewhere between 30 to 40 of them. If you're like me, one or two are barely acceptable, so this many were absolutely not. That said, as mentioned, I was impressed with the price and features of the set, and with the exception of the pixel problem, was quite impressed with the image quality, so I decided to return the item for a replacement and see if this was going to be a common problem, or if I just got a lemon. The replacement set arrived and looked fantastic, so it was clearly a one off, but I would still examine your set carefully if you pick one of these up to make sure you don't get stuck with a similar problem.As for the return and replacement, UPS arrived at my doorstep in two days with a call-tag to pick up the first set, and later that same day, my replacement set arrived. Kudos once again to Amazon for their stellar, speedy service.My review as it follows will be based on the replacement set I received.Firstly, the overall look and design of this TV is very sleek and sexy with a minimal bezel. The set itself has a very thin profile, and weighs a very slight 17 lbs. The stand included with the set is attached via three included screws, and the entire process from unboxing to connecting all my components took all of five minutes with an additional five for setting up the features and wifi. The stand does feel a bit light for the set, even at that minimal weight, and there is some slight wobble, but unless you are jumping up and down in front of it regularly, not something that will affect daily use. The first set I received had hard rubber feet on the bottom of the stand, and was a bit slippery. A simple touch of the side or corners of the set and the set would spin a bit quite easily. The stand on the second set had feet made of softer rubber, and stays put quite nicely.The available inputs are more than adequate for most users, but if you have an entertainment system with multiple audio and video components and game consoles, you may want to assess if there are enough of them here for you. There are 3 HDMI inputs, and one set of shared composite video and audio inputs. There is one USB 2.0 port. I have three game consoles and a Tivo box, but the cable box is currently passed through my Xbox One, so I only need three HDMI ports at this time. Should I add another component to the mix, I will have to rethink my set-up.The picture is really impressive for a set at this price point. The full array LED panel is a feature that was previously unheard of on a set under a thousand dollars, so that is a huge selling point here. The whites are bright and true without being over saturated, the blacks are inky, and color reproduction is true to life. I used the Disney Worlds of Wonder blu-ray to calibrate this TV, and these are the settings I settled on:Backlight 64Brightness 46Contrast 53Color 55Tint -3Sharpness 40Under Advanced picture Settings, I used these:Auto Brightness OFFBlack Detail OFFActive LED Zones ONReduce Signal Noise HIGHReduce Block Noise HIGHFilm Mode AUTOVizio says this set has an \"effective 120Hz refresh rate,\" and I'm not entirely sure how true this is, as there are no settings to turn any kind of motion blur effect on or off, so it feels like it is essentially a 60Hz refresh rate, although I do notice a slight \"soap opera effect\" during faster action scenes, particularly darker ones, and also during scenes shot in a handheld camera, so there may be some sort of automatic refresh rate change happening, but the lack of an option to turn that function on and off is disappointing in a set that otherwise has some very nice features (I have since been corrected that the \"effective\" refresh is done via backlighting, and as stated earlier, the effect is minimal at best, and this is misleading as the set truly has a 60hz refresh rate).Gaming looks wonderful on this set. Both previous gen games and next gen games look crisp and rich, with no detectable ghosting or lag that I could see.The sound is better than I expected. For most flat screen TVs, sound is generally the weak point. I find that the simulated surround sound on this TV works quite nicely, and with several EQ settings to choose from, you can really customize it so that anything sounds good. Of course, the addition of a sound bar wouldn't hurt.The Smart TV functions work nicely even if a few of the interfaces feel a bit clunky. They respond quickly, and the wireless connected quickly to my network with a solid signal that has not wavered, and streams Netflix content in HD with no lag or interruptions. I have other components that handle my streaming services better however, and am not likely to use these through the TV directly, but if you don't have a game console or blu-ray player that offers streaming apps, this feature should appeal to you. *Edit: Other reviewers have noted that there are apps missing from the set, such as Pandora, but they are in fact available. If you simply click the Apps button on the remote twice, then select \"All Apps\", you will find many additional apps available to you, and you can choose what apps you would like to favorite, and the order in which they appear on the dock.On-screen menus are clearly defined and intuitive.One of the bigger disappointments of this set is the remote control. The layout is fine, and the inclusion of dedicated buttons for Netflix and Amazon Video are a nice if common feature, but the build quality is a true shame. Very lightweight plastic that feels cheap in the hand, with buttons that clunk when you press them. It's for this reason that I gave this set four stars instead of five. If you have a decent universal remote however, this won't be a concern for you.All in all, this is a wonderful TV for a fantastic price. It has a beautiful picture, good sound, a solid selection of apps and smart TV features, and that full array LED truly makes this set shine. If you are looking for a set that offers quality at an affordable price, this is the way to go.**UPDATE as of 3/19/2014** - After three weeks, my replacement set has developed a dead pixel problem as well. There are 7 dead pixels left of center of screen in a line that looks like a grey smear until you get up close and see the individual pixels. There is also a stuck pixel at the top of the screen near the bezel, also left of center. I'm very disppointed by this, and will be returning this set. The question now is what to replace it with. This is certainly shaking my confidence in the Vizio brand as far as quality control is concerned. I'll have to think on this for a while. In the meantime, if you own this I suggest you take a good look at your screen. Try to get a solid white, or other solid color screen image up and examine it well.I still stand by all the points of my above review. This is a solid TV with a great picture, and fantatic features for a set in this price range - if you are lucky enough to get a unit without any dead or stuck pixels, that is. I am going to have to drop another star unfortunately due to quality control issues. Two sets in a row with the same issue/defect cannot be ignored.**UPDATE 3/21/2014** - Some good news for folks having trouble with the Amazon app, I spoke with a Vizio rep today regarding a seperate issue, and asked if she could provide any info on the Amazon app. She told me that there is a compliance issue with the FCC due to a Closed Captioning standard in the app, and the app is being re-worked to comply, and should be updated and available within a few weeks.", "Date": "March 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "keeps getting better", "Author": "Armand Gerardi \"Mondo\"", "ReviewID": "R1G8YIEGROHZQE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just lost my Samsung 46 inch top of the line when after only 3 years the picture developed a bad screen. Broke my heart but I realized even Samsung gets bad parts now and then. I take super care of my electronics as I kept this LCD in new condition right up to its death. Three years? I told the Samsung rep on the phone. He just said it was out of warranty, so long story short I decided against another Samsung. I did a solid week of reading reviews and numerous visits to my local stores watching and adjusting several brands before deciding on a 55 inch LG or Vizio as my choices. I hated the new LG's magic remote( works like a mouse on the screen) but I also heard that the Vizio had lame apps on their smart E & the better M series. Just last week I walked into my local \"S\" club and a guy was setting up the new 2014 E series B-2. He told me they were the first to get them. The vizio rep happened to be there and he pointed out that they re-vamped all the smart apps and told me of the new back-lit 12 panel led zone, which  even the 2013 high tech \"M\" series didn't have. After fiddling with the contrast  and temp colors I was able to get a fantastic picture.Bought it, brought it home and set it up.Wow! I was pretty impressed to find a $700 TV that can go up against a $1500 TV. . Vizio also now has a smaller front frame edge measureing 10mm. only 2 mm less than last year but it makes for an almost invisable frame.  Another bonus...Vizio ups the speaker wattage from 10 to 15 watts. Not mindblowing but way improved  from the muffled  speaker sound that is associated  with most down pointed speakers that seems to be standard with most HGTV's. Bottom line I love it. Its good to see a company like Vizio upping their game with internal improvements instead of a cosmetic makeover like a lot of other companies.", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "So close to being a good TV for the price...", "Author": "Fallout", "ReviewID": "R1GYBX5FIB6VI1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First off the TV functions good for the most part. The screen is comparable in sharpness and lighting to the M series and it has a semi-matte finish which is a great improvement over how reflective they used to be. I really wanted to like the TV and if it were not for the folowing items I would have gladly kept it and enjoyed it.The reason for this review is to focus on why I cannot keep the TV and it is going back (and to see if anyone else has the same issues). Amazon has aready exchanged the TV for a new one of the same model and both TVs that I revcieved had the same clicking and humming issues (so I assume the issue may be wide spread).1.) When the TV is off, as other users have noted in their review there is a constant clicking coming from what I suspect is the power supply (the rate is about 10 clicks per second). Depending on how well you can hear its very noticible when behind the TV, If the room is quiet (its in our bedroom) I can hear it from about 10 feet away. The clicking stops as soon as the TV is turned on. Both TVs that I got had this issue.2.) When the TV is on there is a noticible hum or buzzing noise that comes from the back middle of the TV panel. It seems to be linked to the backlighting intensity. I had to turn down the backlighting to 40-50 to lessen the humming.  The sound from the speakers makes it so that you cant hear the humming but once a quiet period comes up I can easily hear the humming from 10+ feet away.  The sound is not coming from the speakers as I have run tests and it is coming from one of the backlighting components. Both TVs that I got had the same issue, the last one seemed louder by a little.3.) The remote/sensor is not good at all and the area of forgiveness on where you have to point it to make it register is laughable.  The first TV seemed really picky and at only worked in about a 1-2 foot radius around the bottom left of the TV (it did'nt matter on how far I stood away it just had to be pointed in that specific area.  The replacement TV had a better range of about a 5-6' radius around the bottom left of the TV.  I tried new batteries, nothing infront or near the sensor, nothing helped. Pretty annoying. I bought the Qwerty Vizio remote and it worked slightly better on the last set but the keyboard only works for a few select things and many of the Apps do not allow the keyboard input so its pointless, which brings be to the last issues.4.) Maybe they will fix these with updates later, but the Smart TV Apps are archaic and missing many features. I got this model because the smart TV side was supposed to be improved with a better processor (the apps load at a decent speed improved over some other brands or older versions of Vizio). Using Youtube is a joke since it does not allow keyboard input on this App (couple that with the finiky remote and good luck typing with the bad scroll select), I had to link it to my smart phone to type but the video which played fine before became very choppy and stopped a few times when trying to use phone link to play.  I was hoping to be able to get by with the TV Apps but as it is I will have to buy another Roku or Apple TV to get any resemblance of a decent user interface.The TV would be good if it were not for these issues, I would have liked to rate it a 4 out of 5. Although after getting two sets that have the exact same issues I cannot recommend this TV. I am worried that the clicking and buzzing are signs of a faulty power supply or capacitors etc. Im going to give it a week then this second set is getting returned and I will not be getting another of the \"2014 E-series B\" models again.In short, anyone who has this model please check for the clicking and humming issues decsribed above and respond to this. I want to know how many others have this issue.", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "VIZIO \"Smart\" TV", "Author": "Norm F.", "ReviewID": "R3K9EXCSN2W3MA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I looked at a lot TVs of various sizes and brands and features.  This had the best specification and reviews in the price range I was seeking.  A load of competition out there and everybody wants to sell you product.  I chose this unit and Amazon as I thought it represented the best value for my dollars.  It arrived rapidly and in good order and set-up was easy enough.  The picture was good and the sound reasonably decent.  Trying to get the TV to connect to my WIFI was another matter.  The set recognized the WIFI and indicated a strong signal, but would not connect.  The free 30 day technical service was invoked and I called for help.  The technical guy was very helpful and did a great job.  He actually spoke English because he was here in the U.S. and not in Asia somewhere.  After a few attempts to connect, he diagnosed the problem and that unit is already headed back to Amazon and a replacement should be delivered today.

After seeing the difference in person between a standard led tv and this full array led tv, I was sold. Gaming on this tv looks amazingly smooth, bright, and crystal clear. Didn't need to adjust any of the picture settings either, the gaming setting gives me a picture quality that I feel is more than sufficient. The only gripe I have against this tv is that the stand is flimsier than older vizio models that I've seen and when I turn the tv (which I do frequently) I'm afraid that it's eventually going to wear out and break. If you're looking for a great quality picture without spending a lot of money, I highly recommend this tv.UPDATE:I've had the tv for almost a month now and I'm still just as happy with it as I was the first day I got it. There is a light indicator on the tv to let you know that the tv is on, it's disabled by default but I enabled it in the TVs settings. As far as gaming lag goes, I've had the picture set to gaming mode and haven't noticed any at all. I've been playing call of duty ghost on the ps4 on this tv a lot, and it's performed beyond my expectations. Also I read a review that states that the smart feature is slow to start up  this is both true and false. The tv doesn't maintain a constant connection to the internet, when you turn the tv off, the internet connection is off. I've noticed that if I try accessing one of the apps such as netflix immediately after I turned the tv on, it takes a while for it to connect. If I turn the tv on, wait a few seconds for it to connect to my router and then try accessing netflix, the app starts very quickly.", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good value", "Author": "Dave G", "ReviewID": "R2MSZ6J4RC33EO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I replaced a Panasonic TH-42PX80U 720p plasma TV with this unit and I'm pleased with the results.DISPLAY QUALITYUnfortunately my i1 is broken so I couldn't calibrate the TV but I can tell from years of looking at calibrated displays that it is pretty good.  I streamed some AVS HD 709 patterns through my Xbox One to the TV in order to set brightness, contrast, color and tint.  I used a blue filter and the color and tint was pretty much right on with no adjustments necessary.  Some other settings I used were:Color Temp  NORMALPicture  Calibrated DarkAuto Brightness  OFFBlack Detail  OFFActive LED Zones  ONReduce signal noise HIGHReduce block noise  HIGHAfter \"calibrating\" the Calibrated setting I found that the Calibrated Dark was about the same as what I ended up with.  The LEDs really blaze and can push the whites really high and it has good blacks too.  I watch mostly in a darkened room so the Calibrated Dark setting is good and probably good for most rooms as long as the light levels aren't intense.  The coating on the display is somewhat reflective but I prefer that to aggressive anti-glare coatings that make it look like you are looking through a haze.  It does appear that there is a very slight uniformity issue with vertical banding when displaying color fields.  Very minor but I thought I would point it out.  Black screen uniformity is interesting.  When you first turn on the TV there is some \"flashlighting\" in the corners but after the TV initializes and the Active LED Zones kick in the uniformity looks great. The display does tend to get somewhat \"milky\" when viewed off-axis, like when the brightness is set too high.  It's not too bad though and very good for a TV in this price range.  I found that setting both noise reduction settings to HIGH really tamed the compression artifacts (DirecTV) without softening the picture too much.  With those settings off you can really see things crawl.REMOTE CONTROLThe remote is mediocre at best, that's all I have to say about that.  I only use it to change picture modes between Calibrated Dark and Game mode.APPSDon't use them, I have other devices connected to the TV for that so they are pretty much redundant.SPEAKERSGood volume without much range and a bit tinny.  About what you would expect from a TV with this bezel size and profile.PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTESThe TV is very light which is nice after having to take an old 46\" CRT projection TV to the recycler last weekend.  One thing that might be a problem for some people is the height of the stand.  It's very low with the bottom of the screen at 2.75\" and the bottom of the bezel at 1.75\" off the surface the TV is sitting on.  So if you have a sound bar, center speaker, Kinect or other items you want to place in front of the TV that can be an issue.  My Xbox One Kinect is a bit over the bottom of the screen but it's not too much of a bother.  With the TV being so light I might make a shelf to put the TV on so the Kinect and other items can sit below it.", "Date": "February 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great picture, really good sound, TV is thin and light... Amazon Instant Video now works!!!!", "Author": "Goldengate \"Goldengate\"", "ReviewID": "R3MDRTV58E7039", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE 4/11/14: Amazon just released this morning the new Amazon Instant Video app for this TV, which is great news.  The TV now streams Amazon Prime videos... the interface is a little strange - instead of the format of the Netflix app which is full screen the Amazon Instant Video app just takes the left third of the screen... however I was able to navigate just fine and streamed a movie in crystal clear HD.  (Until today, this TV displayed a \"coming soon\" message when you tried to access Amazon Instant Video).  My original review follows below....Overall summary:  The brand-new (as of February 2014) just-released Vizio 32 inch HDTV is a huge improvement over the 2013 version (the E320i-A)VIZIO E320i-A0 32-inch 720p 60Hz LED Smart HDTV in both size (much thinner) and in sound quality.  Picture quality is also excellent.  With the exception of the Amazon Instant Video app (see below), the apps work well - they are fast and are updated versions to what I had on my Samsung TV that this replaced (e.g. the Netflix app is much more streamlined).  Advanced features like DLNA networking need more development.  No web browser that I could find but not an issue for me.  Overall this is the first 5-star review I've given to a Vizio product... I am very happy with this TV!Longer review:I have spent the last 12 months trying to find a 32 inch TV for my small home gym.  Basically I want to be able to watch Netflix, Amazon Instant Video and other internet based video offerings on this TV.  I began this quest with the predecessor to this TV, the 2013 Vizio E320i-A0.  I found that TV to have an acceptable picture, but the sound (just like on a 37\" Vizio I purchased the year before) was TERRIBLE.  I decided to \"upgrade\" to the Samsung UN32F5500 Samsung UN32F5500 32-Inch 1080p 60Hz Slim Smart LED HDTV (2013 Model) which had higher video resolution (I didn't notice) and much better sound (which I did notice).  That TV worked OK until last month when Samsung released a firmware update which crashed Netflix for thousands of users (including me) and they were unable to resolve it.  Amazon stood behind that TV and now I'm back to Vizio with their new 2014 model which I really love.  I'm done with Samsung and was happy to see that Vizio is rated #1 in customer satisfaction (no, I don't work for them, I just love my new TV ha ha)Pros:- Picture: WOW, just an amazing, clear, bright picture.  Yes I know it's 720p vs 1080p but it doesn't matter to me.... it looks better to me than the Samsung which was a 1080p.  Blacks are black.  Motion is handled well.  The edges are the same as the center near as I can tell.  It has different video modes (game, vivid, etc) so you can set it how you want it.  Note that the factory default is energy saving and they recommend other video modes for the best picture.  And speaking of energy savings, the rating says this uses $7 a year, down from $9 last year.- Sound:  VERY decent.  Note I'm not going to say this is surround sound with big bass and Captain Kirk whizzing by your head.  For that you need an external sound system.  But the tinny AM-radio sound of prior year's models is replaced by very very decent sound.  There also different sound modes in the settings area to allow you to customize.  Sound and picture are very subjective but I'm happy with both and I sure wasn't with my other two Vizio's.  (The first Vizio I added a sound bar, the second Vizio I returned for the disastrous Samsung model mentioned above).- Set up / etc:  This TV is significantly lighter than last year's model.  And the narrow bezel means that basically it's almost ALL Screen you're looking at... you don't even notice the very small frame around it.  Even the box this comes in is smaller than the 32\" Saumsung box ( I still have it so I can return that model ) and the 32\" box from the Vizio last year.  Literally I can lift this TV with one hand -- it's that light.  It was a pleasure to install.  Speaking of installation, you turn it on and it immediately guides you through a few basic questions (language, how to you get your TV service), it scans some channels and then BAM it's up and running.  The Samsung spent almost an hour scanning channels (this TV is plugged into digital cable directly so it only gets 1 free channel) and then another 20 minutes deleting the scrambled ones.  The set up on this is very intuitive and FAST.- The remote.  This is the same as least year's remote.  No back light.  No big buttons.  But you know what, I like it.  My Samsung remote had a backlight and looked like a 1990s-era cell phone, 12 inches long and tons of buttons that I never used.  Yet it was missing a few things this remote has, namely hot key buttons to go straight to Netflix, M-Go and Amazon video.  I love those buttons.  Also this remote is light, easy to hold, and when it falls it is sturdy (yep, already dropped it on a hard floor, no damage).  Even though the buttons are small, they are logically laid out and I found myself not looking down after a few minutes of using it.- Screen mirroring (sort of..): New for 2014 is what Vizio is calling \"Second Screen Interactivity\" which means that supported apps (right now it's just Netflix and Youtube) allow you to stream videos to the TV similar to Apple's Airplay functionality.  You see a little icon on the screen as you are playing a video in one of these apps and it then plays on your TV.  Right now this is limited to just those two apps and does not work with videos stored on your ios device or with other apps (e.g. Amazon Instant video app).  I have only tested this on the iPhone but Vizio's materials say this also works on Android devices. I hope more apps take advantage of this feature in the future.- Online user manual:  Normally I don't get excited about an online user manual but this one is clear and easy to navigate.  62 pages long.The cons:-  As of this writing, when you go to the Amazon Instant Video app you get this message:  \"The Amazon Instant Video application is currently unavailable while we are working hard to bring you an updated, feature rich application.  For more details, visit amazon.com/videohelp\"  I'm guessing / hoping this will be fixed soon, but not too cool to ship a TV with an Amazon button where Amazon doesn't work.  I spoke with Vizio (great customer service via phone by the way, short hold times and good representative) and they said that Amazon is updating the app to comply with FCC requirements around closed captioning.  I spoke with Amazon and they said they are working on the app but have no date of resolution.  So for now, no Amazon Instant video on this TV.  I PROMISE that when they fix this bug I will come back and put an update RIGHT HERE.- DLNA sharing.  As you might know, DLNA is a standard which allows media devices on the same home network to \"see\" each other and exchange files.  So for example, this TV uses DLNA to see my movies I have stored on my computer.  While Vizio gets a plus for the TV immediately seeing the rest of the network and being able to browse files on my computer, it gets a big negative for not being able to play video files that my Roku can.  It was able to play some .avi files but struggled with .mp4 and .mpg files.  In some cases it displayed a message that the \"codec is not supported\" and in others it just ignored \"play\" commands.  I tried using my PlayOn server to see if the encoding that Playon performs would help this TV play the aforementioned files.  Nope.  In this area Samsung was stronger and Roku is still the best at being able to play anything you throw at it.- No web browser.  Most of the Smart TV's I've used have rudimentary browers.  I haven't found on one here so far.  I wouldn't use my TV to browse the web but some might be looking for that feature.  I will keep looking for it and will update this review if I find one but a Google search indicates this is a long-standing yet unfulfilled feature request.- No update feature.  I assume this TV downloads updates but I've searched all over the menus and I cannot find an \"update now\" feature for firmware or apps.  This might be a plus if it's all seamlessly automatic in the background.That's it.  This is a phenomenal TV at a great price.  Vizio has come a long way from last year's model in picture quality and especially sound.Hope this helps!UPDATE Feb 20th:  As of today, the Amazon app still doesn't work.. TV still displays a \"under development\" message.  Also I have not had the issues with the TV cutting off that some others have had... that concerns me.

Strange since there is an Amazon button on the remote.UPDATE April 10th:  Amazon still says they are working on this app.  I just bought a second unit of this model for my sister and it has the same Amazon issue.  ALSO the wireless setup was problematic -- until I plugged it into an ethernet (hard wire) connection and let it update.. then wireless works GREAT.

That was why I went with this unit.  However, it has an inexcusable flaw which is a deal-breaker for me.  The spec. sheets say that this unit has 160 degree vertical viewing angle, but in reality, the screen looks completely black from even a few degrees below horizontal.  Left, right, and above have good viewing angles but not below.  I was hoping to put this on the wall in the dining room, but now have to find a bracket which will angle it sharply toward the ground in order for it to be viewable from the table seats.I thought maybe I had a defective unit so I went to a large retail store and found that the 24 inch and smaller Vizio's were all this way and the above 24 inch models were not this way.  None of the other brands had this poor viewing angle - but none of the other small TV's had smart features to match this one either.The only other real cons that I've found with this TV are that the speakers sound tinny and the base is flimsy.Bottom line: if you will be viewing this from level or above, it is a great little TV and I would give it 4 or 5 stars.  The picture looks good, features are great, and the unit looks nice and is well made.

This includes the varying differences in menu options and picture settings.======================================I'm awaiting a detailed review from CNET at the moment and will update my review when that happens.  Should occur around April 2014.  CNET typically posts EXCELLENT calibrated settings which include colors/contrast/tint etc.Out of the box, I'm impressed with the style and design.  This thing is extremely light as well.The active LED dimming zones seem to produce a very uniform picture.  I really like the black levels here.The set seems to have a split personality, as calibrated by Vizio.  I either see an incredibly beautiful image, or an extremely mediocre one.  Any scene heavily dominated by lush reds, blues, and purples, looks strange.  Something my wife, who is NOT a videophile, even pointed out on her own.  It's, obviously, far worse on upscaled SD content.  This shouldn't be an issue some say, but when you stream Hulu/Netflix, think about how many times your content scaled DOWN to SD due to your internet connection.What the default features share, however, is an extremely high setting of Contrast and sharpness.  At the expense of color accuracy, this set will produce a sharp image with bright and washed out colors.  Some may say this produces a \"clayface\" like effect.The \"Calibrated-Dark\" and \"Calibrated\" setting is possibly the most reasonable when it comes to color...but even these ask for a high amount of Contrast.Outside of the picture quality (which is what's most important IMO)  this set features great apps to use natively, if you don't already have a console you use to watch them with.  The remote and menu system is also very snappy and responsive.  I had no issues getting the TV up and running, and also connected to the internet.The TV must be so easy to set up, it doesn't even come with a full manual.  You have to go onto the internet to find it.When you read the actual manual, you will find out that the features on this set differ significantly from what is listed...which is very strange.Again, I'll update my review if we can get a decent calibration setting.  As it stands now...I'd say hold on to your receipt and see if you like it before keeping it.

The picture is good and works well even in rooms where the lighting is hard to control.The menu system is relatively easy to get through; however, some of the apps could have used a little more development and could be a little more consistent. Many of the apps are Yahoo based. I have to ask... Why Yahoo?I do recommend you plan to get a smart remote for this TV. I am not sure why companies think this is OK, but when I buy a big screen TV even a cheaper one, I expect a half ways decent remote.I also have to ask who's idea was it to make an energy star sticker with an adhesive that leaves a residue and stick part of it to the screen?

I finally went with the new 2014 version of this TV due to the features that it offers. The full array LED dimming can't be found in any TV within this price range. The bezel is amazingly thin for a lower priced unit as well. For what you pay, this TV delivers. The sound, obviously leaves much to be desired, though any thin TV will.The apps are a nice feature and they respond quickly. The WiFi is great and I get a full signal from my router that is upstairs on the opposite end of my house. I found that you can turn on an option in the settings that will allow you to control other devices that are connected through the HDMI. I know other TVs offer this, but I thought it only worked with same brand items. I have a Sony BluRay player and when I turn on the player, the TV automatically switches inputs and the Vizio remote controls it. I like that feature since the DirecTV remote won't control everything.Do yourself a favor though...when you first turn it on to verify that it works (part of Amazon's delivery service) make sure you choose \"Home Setup\" right out of the gate or it will default to the store demo. You'll then have to reset some settings if you set it up while in the store demo. Kind of a pain, but I had to do it bc I didn't choose anything at first.The only problem I have with the TV is I have a spot of 4 dead pixels in the top left corner. It's not noticeable unless the screen is on a brighter scene. I don't think the warranty will do anything for such a small flaw, but it's kind of annoying since I just got the TV today and have already sold my old one.**UPDATE**So after a couple days of use, I wanted to post an update.First, the issue with the dead pixels seems to have corrected itself as the black spot isn't noticeable anymore.Second, as another user commented on my review, the base is definetly wobbly. It seems like it will hold fine, but if you have an unstable stand, you might want to take this into consideration.Third, (the most important to my wife, lol) the remote sensor is extremely sensitive. You can't have anything blocking it. You have to point DIRECTLY at it to get the TV to respond. This is really a pain since I don't like to hold the remote up in the air to change the settings like volume or to use the other features. That is really the big complaint on this TV (other than the wobbly stand). Everything else really looks great. The picture is still really great - I leave mine on the Vivid setting and turn the auto brightness off.In all, the flaws are minor for such a low price on a 55\" full array LED TV with multiple dimming zones.I'll be sure to edit this post again if I have any issues.", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome little TV", "Author": "E.

So the only thing I have to compare it to is TV's at my friends houses and watching sports at bars.Needless to say, I am no longer envious of other people's TV's. I feel like I hit the jackpot my first time out and now it's their TV's that don't look as good as mine.First of all it was delivered ( on time) by a specialty carrier who not only brought the TV inside, they unpacked it, let me inspect it for damage, put the bottom on, placed it on a Sonax FB-2600 Fiji 60-Inch TV Component Bench, Ravenwood Black that I purchased for it, and we turned it on to insure that it was working correctly. When they left, the took the packaging and trash with them. The entire delivery experience was an unexpected bonus!Once the cable company brought my digital box, set up was pretty easy. For a few minutes I thought something was wrong with it because the picture wasn't what I expected...but then I figured out that I wasn't on HD stations. Once I put it on HD stations (and hooked up the box via HDMI instead of the coaxial cable), it was glorious! The picture crystal clear, sharp, and after a few adjustments it was just how I wanted it. The picture was so nice that I even watched 30 minutes of soccer just because the colors were so vivid.The sound isn't bad. Better than most newer TVs.  But I hooked it up to a Vizio sound bar that I already had and that made it even better.Setting up my Netflix, and M-Go accounts was painless, although the Amazon App isn't working at the moment...which kind of sucks.There are a lot more Vizio Apps available than they advertise and I find them all easy to use and even enjoyed some new programming that I didn't even knew existed. It's true that many of the apps are Yahoo apps, but one of them is Yahoo Fantasy Football, so another bonus for this upcoming Football season since I play in that league.There are a lot of Fox Local News affiliate apps...which is kind of strange.I did under estimate how big 55\" was. I probably would have been fine with 42\"-48\", but it's not overwhelming. I'm actually glad I went bigger. It's a real movie experience which I expect to get even better once my new Roku Streaming Stick arrives.Another unexpected usage was hooking up my laptop via HDMI port. I'd been taking some online  classes with a ton of video lectures, and quizzes. It was awesome to be able to do my classes on the big screen from the couch instead of sitting at my desk or holding a laptop.The user interface is very easy to understand, settings are a breeze, and you don't have to do a whole lot of fiddling and adjusting to get a great picture right out of the box.I do wish that it came with the QWERTY keyboard remote, but for $12 it wasn't a big deal to just order one.I don't have any major complaints about this TV. If you are a first time HD Flat Screen buyer like I was, this is the perfect set for you. Especially for the price.If you are an Audio/Video snob and think that you are going to spend $700 and get a $2500 TV, then don't buy this TV. Go buy a $2500 TV. For my money and needs, this TV is very nice.UPDATE: Roku streaming stick arrived and it's awesome! The included smart apps on the TV are fine, but adding a Roku to this TV adds so much more entertainment value to it. The user interface is much smoother, and the channel offering is second to none.I also added a Logitech Harmony Smart Keyboard (Amazon doesn't sell. Got it from Logitech website), which controls the TV, Roku, the laptop I have hooked up to it, my Blueray player, Cable, and the Harmony app lets me use my phone or tablet as a remote. I also  added Panasonic SC-HTB20 Energy Star 2.1-Channel 240-Watt Multi-Positional Full HD 3D Audio System (2012 Model) for better sound.I highly recommend the additional accessories.

I wanted a good TV this size for our kitchen, preferred 1080P over 720 and wanted built-in wireless and smart apps (Netflix etc).  All the features of the 2014 model were exactly what I wanted, so I placed the order.We don't have cable or satellite, we watch over-the-air broadcast TV and internet based services for our television and movie viewing.  With that, this set pulled in several more channels than the old set with a digital to analog converter box did.  Even seems to get few more than other HD sets i the house.  Picture clarity is spot on, but I did have to adjust he color & tint a bit from the OOTB settings - people looked a little orange.  The sound is fine for a TV in a kitchen, bedroom, exercise room - something like that.  Don't expect any bass or richness in the audio, it's sort of tinny sounding.  Not surprising considering the setup of the integrated speakers, but actually worse than I expected it would be.  Only other concern is for some reason when it first turns on, the picture is very green - then it suddenly corrects itself.  Not sure what would cause this, but I've never had another TV do that.  Also, as noted on the product description page, although it has the Amazon Prime logo, it does not actually work yet.  If you try to access it the TV indicates a firmware update will bring a newer Amazon app soon (just as the Amazon page states). So for a pro / con summary:Pros:-very compact set, nice thin bezel, takes up very little space- great OTA HD reception- picture is very clear / sharp.- no ghosting  / smearing in the screen image observed so far (I have a 4 year old Sharp 32\" LCD that is terrible for that)- app access interface clear and intuitive-overall other interface elements (setup menus, info at top of screen when changing channels (channel #, program info, wireless strength...) are well done, concise, easily understood / used- the remote:  Not something I really thought of before this, but I like the feel of the remote.  A lot of remotes have a mushy button feel, this one has just the right amount of tactile \"click\" feel.  The button layout is average (lots of small buttons) but is usable.  The set / remote responsiveness is great too, no lag.- Very full feature set - smart set, built in wireless, 1080P panel...The Cons:- That revised stand design is nice because the set is vertical now instead of tilted back slightly, but it is flimsy.  Not really a problem where we have it (only notice it when we spin it right / left a bit depending on where we are in the kitchen) but something to think about if you have it on top of a dresser in your apartment in an old house and the floors have some \"bounce\" in them.- the initial green hue screen I'm seeing, maybe it's just my set...just doesn't seem right- the sound - acceptable for a kitchen TV, watching the news, kids shows, or a cooking show etc,, but if you're looking for more than that, a different set or add-on speakers might be worth looking into.- current lack of Amazon Prime support.  Supposed to be corrected with a firmware update, but no word on when.For what I paid and how I'm using the set, I'd buy it again.  Just consider where / how you intend to use it.", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "48\" Model", "Author": "Fertacrit \"Fertacrit\"", "ReviewID": "R1MMKR8C56BFVL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ok.  I have had this for about 3 weeks now.  I went from an Insignia 37\" 60hz non-smart LCD to this TV.  Its for our living room, so our main TV.  I was happy with our Insignia, but definately needed something bigger as I would get headaches at night, from eye strain.  My mom has had a Vizio for a few years and it has served her very well.  So when I saw I could get 12 mo interest free here on Amazon, I figured I would begin my search.  Now I analyze everything almost to the point of paralysis by over analysis, by reading customer reviews (on Amazon and AVSforum) and tech reviews from the likes of CNET.  Unfortunately this TV is too new CNET does not have a review up yet (hopefully soon).  Reviewed.com does have a technical review up of the 48\" model tho.Here are my thoughts.I was close, VERY close to returning this.  I was hoping, almost expecting to be wowed by the picture due to the LED array and its newer technology overall.  Well it left me lukewarm at best.  BUT after a TON of tweaking and using some calibration settings from other reviewers, I think I have found the sweet spot for us.  Now the 120hz scared me.  The wife and I DO NOT think the \"Soap Opera\" looks good at all.  To us there is no depth with that and not natural looking.  On a side note, our brains n eyes are programmed to see motion blur, for example wave your hand from side to side in front of your face and you will see blur.  But I digress.  This TV does not have the \"Soap Opera\" effect (THANK GOD).  After reading AVSforum thread for the 48\" set, a reviewer on there has stated that this series of TV's are actually a 60hz native, with 120hz active which explains the lack of \"S.O.E\".  Before I got the picture settings the way I wanted, there was some \"choppiness\" to fast moving pictures, but now it is very minimal.  But we would rather have that effect than the soap opera effect.  So not a deal breaker by any means.  It is still a lot better than our older Insignia.  You also have to keep in mind when setting the settings, that source has ALOT to do with it. We have cable and some channels look spectaculaer (Like Palladia, Discovery and ESPN) and others can look not so spectacular.  So when you do make changes look at a few different channels to get a better Idea.  Bluray and Vudu look fantastic.  So far any game we play on our PS3 looks great too. (I did adjust a few settings for the \"Game\" setting for that).We will definitely be getting a sound bar with wireless sub soon.  The speaker have good volume but thats about it.  Our old TV was hooked up with a 2.1 Klipsch PC Speaker set up using the headphone jack so we miss the \"full\" sound alot.  It's like going from a home theater to a transister radio, just no \"oomph\", not that I was expecting any.  But the new TV's don't have headphone jacks anymore, so 2.1 sound bar it is.Not much to say about the remote as we use the cable remote other than to link to Vudu or change the input to the PS3.Now the apps.  Some have said that the apps are useless, some don't work and signal reception is bad.  But most of those issues seem to be for the 55\".  So when you read reviews, pay attention to what model you are reading about. (Really wish Amazon would not group all the sets together like this, cuz if one model has problems, it drags down the overall ratings of the models that is actually working well).  My firmware version is V1.16.55.0802 and again have not had any issues with Amazon Prime or Vudu (do not use any of the others, so can't comment).  There is more than one factor involved when it comes to the wireless reception, and everyone's situation is different, thus results will all be different.  We have a Wireless-N router and don't have any issues.Hopefully firmware updates are downloaded automatically, cuz for the life of me I can't find anywhere to check for updates for the TV.In closing, it took some time to get the picture to where WE like it as everyone sees differently (kinda obvious but has to be said).  I suggest, you give it a few weeks of tweaks, and try different sources before you make a final decision to keep or return it, if you do pull the trigger.  IMO you can't make an educated decision on just a few days of use...with anything.Hope this helps", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Uggh", "Author": "B.

Great picture, lightweight, but that's where it appears to stop.I noticed almost immediately that the sound alternates high to low, much more than ANY TV I've ever owned or watched.  I use this in a quieter bedroom setting so this makes it unacceptable.Then 2-3 weeks after purchase (literally 4 hours of usage) it started turning itself on.  I thought it might have been a fluke, but after the third time I called Vizio.  It took me a couple of calls to get through to the right person (expected in 2014???) and they had me reset the entire thing to factory.  Unplug and hold down the power button for 30 seconds, then plug back in and go through the menu to do a reset to factory.  This means re-entering everything (wireless internet password, application usernames and passwords, etc.) and you have to rescan the channels (5 minutes of waiting).  They said that might fix it otherwise they'd have to send someone out to check it out (he said possibly a power board or some other hardware issue).Uh, yeah...  No thanks.  This will be going back.  Too many issues for 4 hours of usage.UPDATE: next day...  TV turned itself on again.  Crazy.UPDATE 2 - the following day: Just noticed this morning that the TV has a clicking noise coming from it while it's off. I can hear it from about 5-10 feet away.

I put the TV in my cart and started a chat with an Amazon representative. I found this same unit online at Samsclub for $698 and let them know so they would price match. I then got the prime membership $30 rebate on top of that price match. I just figured maybe that would help some people out. Even if you have already purchased it Amazon will price match up to 14 days after your order. (THE OFFER IS NOW GOOD FOR $20 OFF FOR PRIME MEMBERS MARCH 23 2014 however, that is subject to change of course)Update after I received the T.V.: Well, first of all, as far as the $30 rebate goes; I am not sure if that was just a deal going on during the time of my purchase so don't hold Amazon to that. It had nothing to do with getting an amazon credit card, it was just a \"buy it now because prime members get $30 more off.\" That was an item of confusion for some it seems. Now to the TV...I got the tv and it was a very easy setup. The stand hooks on to the back by sliding it up into the tv and then mounting it. I suggest putting the tv face down on a table with a sheet over the table to do this. Like many have said, the stand is very wobbly. But I don't get up to randomly shake my tv too often so I am not worried about that. Plus I can go get a mount and mount it up for $20 and I am fine that way. I am not here to take stars away because of a wobbly stand. It doesn't wobble unless you wobble it.The speakers are on the back so I planned to go buy the Vizio sound bar to go with it. They have a nice easy setup to buy a bar or a bar and wireless subwoofer or both of those and speakers. But I turned on the tv, cranked up the sound and said \"no way jose.\" It sounds just fine to me. If it ain't broke I ain't fixin' it. It really does sound great, and if you want more boom then you were planning on getting speakers or a subwoofer anyway so no complaining. The picture is great! If you find yourself wanting more brightness or whatnot, just go to settings and change things up. I was also really impressed that the light from my windows shinning directly on the tv did not drive me too crazy.This is the absolute best TV for your money. Get it now.

You will need to go to the hardware store before your TV arrives to purchase four 4mm x 25mm Phillips flat machine screws in order to mount the TV to the TV stand (cost $1.40 + tax).  The TV stand seems a little cheap and shaky, but it does appear to do the job.  But if you have large pets and/or little children, I would seriously consider skipping the TV stand and mount it to the wall instead.Amazon Customer Service was very, very helpful and offered me two options - I chose to take a slight discount on the TV for my time to go to the hardware store and figure out how to fix the parts issue for the TV stand.  Thanks Amazon!After I successfully mounted the TV to the TV stand, everything else was fine - the color is outstanding (kind of reminds me of a plasma TV picture).

I'm not particularly interested in the wireless features or apps because I use my PC connected to the TV for everything; I'm sure wireless would be frustrating for an HD experience until wireless ac equipped TV's become standard anyway. I don't use DVD players, or watch television. I only have my PC and PS3 and can only speak for this usage.Picture quality out of the box is pretty good, but the settings may need to be adjusted. Default settings have extreme brightness but washed out color, and a bit of playing with settings resolved this. Afterwards, I was impressed with the TV's overall clarity, although disappointed with the pixelation in darker scenes and SD content. However, in the advanced settings, I toggled black detail to low, and afterwards experienced no problems with pixelation, clarity or color. With the PS3, when using game mode, the display seemed more responsive and has less lag. In both cases, they are connected via HDMI in 1080p. I don't have anything else connected, and don't make use of the tuner at all, but from my viewing experience with the PC, I can say HD content looks stunning, and after playing with some of the settings, SD content remains watchable (I feared otherwise in transitioning from DLP to LED).

Since I knew it was coming, I'd been looking at potential replacements. It came down to this or a 46\" Samsung. I was a bit leery of Vizio since I had an older 22\" unit that stopped working and turned out to be unrepairable due to cost of the parts. It was only 3-4 years old at the time, so I was less than pleased.I read the reviews with that in mind and it seems like QC issues with earlier Vizio sets have been resolved, so I decided to buy the 48\" unit.I set the unit up at home using hints in some of the reviews and it's a great TV. The picture is, as I would expect, 10 years better than what the Olevia gave me. I love that very little real estate is taken up by the bezel around the screen and I get much more picture in the same size footprint as with the old set.Unlike others I don't have a real problem with the supplied remote. I might try to find a replacement with a real key board, but other than that, it does what it's supposed to do even with the Amazon Instant Video application.Which brings me to the part I don't like so much. Intermittently the applications that require Internet connectivity won't work because the set reports that it's not connected to my router. I opted to run an Ethernet cable instead of relying on WiFi because of some of the comments about choppiness with streaming video. Every once in a while, the TV reports that I am not connected and I can't use the Amazon app to run videos. So far restarting the TV has corrected that, but I suspect that the problem is with the TV and not my router. Actually, I know it because the first time it happened, I plugged the cable in to my laptop and it connected to the Internet just fine. In fact one time I ran a video through my laptop into the TV using the HDMI out on the laptop and HDMI into the TV. The video ran just fine.My guess (and it's just that) is that it's a firmware or software problem with the set and it will be fixed with a future revision. Which brings me to a question. Does the set automatically check for updates or is there a manual process for that?So far I'm very happy with the TV other than the Ethernet issues. It turns on quickly, switches from HD to SD quickly, and has very good sound even with the standard speakers. I also like the power on light option and the fact that it doesn't play an annoying power on sound as do the Samsung and some other brands.", "Date": "March 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Bought from Amazn and cant get amazon", "Author": "Randy", "ReviewID": "RWGT224PU73R7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The amazon app has been in an up date since we bought the TV, when we called and asked about it we were told it would be a week for the up date to finish and here we are a month and a half later with no end in sight. great TV but we only use Amazon Prime and Netflix so its a pain in the rear not having this feature when we were counting on It being available", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Most apps don't work", "Author": "James Hughes", "ReviewID": "R12JGWVFYQQM41", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My picture appears highly pixelated when viewing the only app that will start, Netflix.

Up until 2 weeks ago the only retailers where Amazon and Sam's Club. Just so happens I am a Costco Member plus I am not fond of shipping large fragile things so I was waiting to buy... Then my monthly Costco trip came up and what did they just get 3 of? The E550i-B2 55\" Smart LED HDTV. (Since they have gotten about 20 more creating a whole pallet stack display.) So after pondering the decision over Charmin Ultra, and Baby Diapers. I had them load 1 up to take home.Killer price point (Amazon does not have the lowest price on it...) plus at the end of the year I get 10% back on it because I am an 'Executive Club Member'. So being a Technofile 1/2 the stuff I got at Costco stayed in the car because I was pulling my old TV off the wall ready to mount that 55\" beauty up there! It only took about 5 minutes to get the VESA mount off the old TV and on the new 1. First thing I noticed was the VESA mounts are super low compared to my older Vizio ( but then again there is about 1/2 as much weight ). The upgrade from 47\" to 55\" is pretty substantial especially since this is my Bedroom TV ( I actually replaced a 7 year old Philips 42\" LCD HDTV in the living room with the 47\" older Vizio out of my bedroom. ). With 3 boys, a XBOX 360 & a XBOX ONE I am not too welcome in the living room, LoL, so I have our bedroom setup.It did not take anytime to get the TV up and exploding with \"Full-Array 120Hz LED HD\" that is extremely better that my 4 year old LCD, especially when watching full 1080p like Blu-Ray or the AppleTV. Even with my Motorola Dual Tuner HD DVR from the cable company, the 1080i it puts out is a lot crisper and vibrant that my older model Vizio. It is also great using my AppleTV and Airplay to display my MacBook Pro so I can sit back with the laptop on the nightstand and use my Bluetooth Keyboard & Mouse to get some Photo editing done ( or surf the net ). So far the picture quality is almost as nice as my Apple 27\" Thunderbolt Displays.I would say there are 2 things that are not up to 'snuff', the Remote Control is plain useless ( it is like a downgrade from the previous E Series's QWERTY remote plus it is NOT even universal so I still need my DVR Remote, my Blu-Ray Remote, ect. So I programmed the TV code into the DVR Remote, which is universal and it will do everything the Vizio Remote will, even Apps and have been scouring the net to see if the alternative Vizio QWERTY Remote will work on the 2014 E Series B line but the TV's are so new no one has any information yet.), and next is the VIOS Apps PLUS content... Other than Netflix / Hulu, which my AppleTV, and Blu-Ray already have, there is really nothing of sustenance on it. Even after forcing myself to get a Yahoo account, thinking I could possibly download additional Apps, notta', There previous Google Apps setup was better that this. Lucky I have the AppleTV's, and Airplay (not to mention a massive iTunes Apple Lossless Music, Canon EOS 5D Mark III 21MP RAW Photography Aperture Library and 1080p .m4v Movie collection on my 2 WD 8TB Thunderbolt RAID's that will display beautifully using the AppleTV but none of those formats are used by this Smart App Center).So as far as the hardware, display, quality, size, and value for the $$ this next Generation Full Array LED Display are 5 stars. The Remote and Apps bring it down 1/2 a star for me.Would I purchase again? You bet! Do I hope for some software updates and optional Remotes, definitely. The E550i-B2 did just start shipping at the end of January so hopefully these minor issues can be addressed. ( I noticed they also just started shipping the 60\" E Series B line and pricing is right on par at the next level, so I am satisfied with 55\" at $679.99. ) But this is only a week old unit, with a lot of new technology in it.

Amazon is unavailable due to an upgrade ATM.Biggest dislikes are the TV stand.. It seems pretty cheap and if I were to bump the TV even slightly It may fall over.

Swanson\"", "ReviewID": "R37IIC3K56BTJZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose this Vizio because I wanted a TV with a good picture but I don't care for 3D. There were some good early reviews on this model with its full array design as opposed to edge lit and high number of dimming zones (16). I was replacing a 9 year old Olevia 37\" set, so I was expecting a giant leap forward and so far I have not been disappointed. I am not a videophile, whatever that is, but I am interested in getting a good, up to date product, since I don't plan on replacing it for a long time. I was planning to buy a Samsung or LG but decided to try Vizio because it had only the features I cared about at an attractive price.Design:The bezel is so thin it pretty much disappears. The TV is very lightweight (35 lbs), which makes wall mounting pretty easy. The VESA mounting holes are very low (only about a foot from the bottom edge) so careful measuring is a must when mounting. I bought a new Cheeta Mount which seemed flimsy but holds the TV well enough. I was able to handle the unpacking and setup myself, and my wife assisted with hanging it on the mount. There is more screen reflection than my old set  but the image is bright and it's not a deal breaker. The full user manual can be viewed on the TV or on Vizio's web site, the included Quick Start booklet is just for the basic setup.Picture:I think the picture quality is really good. There is quite a range of brightness so the picture is viewable in a bright or dark room, and the blacks are very black with good detail. I'm using the Calibrated (dark) preset and auto brightness set to High, and this seems to work well day or night. The other presets are too bright for me.Connections:4 HDMI  connections is nice, my old set only had 1. The ports are accessible (with a little patience) while the TV is mounted on the wall but it's probably smarter to make all the connections before you mount if possible. Swithing between inputs is very fast and each can be labelled so it shows which component it connects to on the screen instead of just \"HDMI 1, HDMI 2,\" etc. I decided to plug everything in directly to the TV instead of using my Sony receiver to switch inputs because it works so much faster. I'm using the optical out to send the audio back to the receiver and this setup works very well with no lip sync problems. Before plugging in the optical I spent a few minutes trying to get the HDMI audio return to work, but even though both the TV and receiver manuals said it should work I gave up. Optical doesn't seem to have any drawbacks anyway. Some sort of connection from the TV back to the receiver is necessary to get the audio from the built in apps (Netflix etc.) to the receiver even if I did choose to use the receiver as a switch, something I hadn't thought about ahead of time. I have nothing to say about the built in speakers. I checked to make sure they worked but I never expect to use them.Remote:Very good for a TV remote, the \"V\" button kind of reminds me of something from the Disney movie \"Cars.\" Nice design touch. I use a Harmony remote most of the time but so far I haven't figured out the programming to control the built in apps (Netlix etc.) so I use the Vizio remote for that.Smart TV:I didn't care about the apps or WiFi but they came along for free with this very reasonably priced TV. The WiFi connection was easy and works fine, though the TV is right next to my router so I would expect a good signal. You can also plug in an Ethernet cable if you prefer. I've tried the Netflix and Amazon Instant Video apps, both work fine but use an older design, not as nice as the Apple TV or Roku versions. Apps get updated all the time so I expect these will improve. I did retire my 2nd gen Apple TV which I used mostly for Netflix because it only supported 720p and the Vizio version provides 1080p which is an obvious improvement on this larger screen.Delivery:Amazon \"Enhanced Delivery\" was provided by Pilot. Once Amazon sent it off to Pilot I lost track of where it actually was, but a little over a week after purchase the driver called me and asked if I was at home to receive delivery. I was expecting them to make an appointment in advance but it worked out OK. The box was undamaged and easy for the two of us to get into the house. The driver (not an installer, just a driver) said that his instructions were to unpack, remove the materials, and plug the TV in to see a \"blue screen\" indicating that it worked. The day it arrived the temp was 5 degrees F and he said that the TV had been in the cold warehouse and that it should be left in the packaging for several hours to warm up before trying to plug it in. He also advised me to keep the packaging. This seemed to make sense, but after about an hour it was warm to the touch and I was able to unpack and connect it myself without much trouble. I think the driver may have just wanted to get going a little faster, but as long as there was no damage it was OK with me. It was much easier than trying to get it home from the store myself.So, I'm very happy with this purchase so far (1 week). I haven't seen any of the problems reported by others, and I'm hoping it will last a long time.", "Date": "March 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "tv", "Author": "Elaine", "ReviewID": "R6JBOJP4DEEBR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am just getting use to it, as a smart tv. love it.

In regards to the problem with the stand, and the screws being too short, as mentioned by another reviewer - the screws are NOT too short! We made the same mistake the other reviewer apparently made, assuming that the stand attached directly to the back of the unit. If you try to do it that way, you'll find that the screws ARE much too short. This because the stand is not meant to be attached to the back of the tv. The quickstart guide is not real helpful at this point. We found, purely by accident, a \"slot\" in the bottom of the tv, that the stand slides up into, THEN you insert the screws into the holes in the back of the tv, and directly into the aligned holes on the stand, that is now inserted into the housing of the tv. Kind of hard to explain, so just look at the bottom of the tv. You'll get it. (Lucky fella, that other reviewer! He complained to Amazon about having to buy longer screws, and got some money back.

Unexpected good quality TV sound.My only complaint is that I have signed up for an Amazon Prime trial yet the shipping takes 4 days. I am not impressed with their shipping guarantee so far and their video service is pretty basic. Other than this Amazon is still my go to retailer. I guess I just need to wait for the shipping drones to arrive.***Update***I feel the power cord is too short after hanging it on the wall. You will need some type of extension if you do not have a outlet directly below the TV. Also the power cord mount to the TV is at an angle and is very easily unseated or ( accidentally unplugged).  Also the remote, while I still love it is designed well, I have found that the buttons are tough to depress and are very clicky. Perhaps this is a good this in case you roll onto it as it may not be as easy to press an unwanted button. An illuminated remote would have been very practical too for those with poor eyesight.

Netflix, Amazon TV, iTunes and DVD's look great. The monitor adjusts it's brightness automatically and we're happy with the performance so far, we get up and party in the middle of the night, it's nice that the monitor does not turn on at full brightness for sleepy eyes.The remote control is compact and easy to use.This is my first SMART TV and IMO it's not that smart because the apps are slow, much slower than the Mac Mini we normally use. You push the Netflix button and it takes a while for the set to get it up onscreen, navigating around in Netflix is also slow using the built-in smart TV. Netflix-HD LOOKS amazing on this monitor running through the smart-TV native app, lines are noticeably sharper and less pixelated than the Mac Mini video output on the same HD program. It is nice that the Vizio has the smart apps, it gives us more viewing options, we can have the Mac doing other tasks like compressing video while watching a movie using the built-in Smart TV apps. Generally speaking we prefer the speedy performance of the Mac as a source rather than the built in apps, we consider those to be \"included free\", but they were not a real consideration in the purchase. Price, picture quality and size were our main buying selection criteria.The trim around the perimeter of the monitor is very compact, I love that, it is not trying to be fancy, instead it's compact and understated in appearance, perfect for our viewing room.Overall we're delighted, no funny noises from the power supply, it was easy to unbox and set up, it's light weight so it's not hard to move. My little bit of griping about the apps being slow is nothing in the grand scheme here, I paid this much for a high quality computer monitor a few years ago, now you get 40 amazing LED inches for a bit less $$, now is a great time to consume TV.", "Date": "April 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great little TV.", "Author": "Kel C \"KC\"", "ReviewID": "R3G55MZJIM3ZDE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an awesome TV for the price.

To the point that I had to rig a safety cable to the wall in case a cat or child were to give it a slight tug. The bezel is also very narrow and almost disappears entirely.Downsides are few, but there. The stand doesn't raise the TV up from what it's sitting on very much, so keep that in mind. Also, audio quality is average at best. It doesn't distort and will get moderately loud (certainly enough to hear), but there is just no bass or fullness at all.

The stand for the 48\" is perfect.  Just remember to read the directions ;-)2. It has a glossy screen.3. It is NOT a true 120Hz.  It has an \"effective\" 120Hz refresh rate. It's really a 60Hz trying to be a 120Hz. It didn't bother me enough to want to return it.4. It has no external power button (at least that I could find).  Without the remote, you're screwed.3 & 4 are why I gave it 4 not 5 stars.Now for the complete review:I received mine a day late and yes, it was Amazon's fault (they didn't get it on the truck on time - you'd think since I'm a Prime member they'd do it right). Got an extra month on my Prime membership for the late delivery though.  Box came in pretty good condition from FedEx (small ding on the top but didn't penetrate the box). It comes in the normal box you'd get from a brick'n'mortar store and not double boxed.I had read a previous review about the screws for the stand being too short. I'm not sure if the stand is quite the same as the 55\", but the stand for the 48\" is perfect.  I had actually gone out and purchased the longer screws after reading that review....then I read the directions: there's a slot in the bottom where the base slides in to and the screws were the correct size.  DOH! Typical male 'I don't need no instructions' attitude lol. So, if you own the 48\" don't worry..the stand is fine.Setting up is pretty easy.  Connected to my WiFi no problem. On screen keyboard is horrible to use (as most are). It does suck that you have to accept a Yahoo! internet terms of service, BUT you don't have to register any personal information.The TV picture is AMAZING! Like others have said, it does remind me of a plasma.  Played Iron Man 2, Thor: DW, Avengers and Skyfall through it and the action sequences were just as clear as any other 120Hz (but without the 'soap opera' look you get with 120's)Streamed Netflix just fine.

Lo", "ReviewID": "R10DQCM2R7LUZC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First let me start with the bad. Besides needing alot of calibration to get a great picture, I have noticed the set has debris in between the LCD and Backlight layers. They appear as black dots. I have received two of these sets from amazon and they both have this problem but in different areas of the screen. They are only noticeable when there is a bright picture displayed on the screen. If you have purchased this tv, I suggest putting a bright image on the screen and looking at all areas of the screen for these spots. I do not think they are dead pixels, but more likely debris from the manufacturing process. Besides this problem which is more annoying then anything, the tv does make up for it. The speakers sound good and are loud enough to fill a room. Once calibrated, color reproduction is pretty good, and the local dimming produces inky blacks that other LCD tvs arent able to produce. Set up was a snap and having a dedicated Netflix button on the remote is awesome. I found the remote to be VERY clicky, which is something I like. The tv is thin and light, and very easy to mount to a wall. This tv looks great with the Xbox one as well as the PS4. Overall for the price you cant go wrong. My only nitpick are those little black spots in the screen, but besides that it is a great tv.

After a day of having it, I've learned that while it does have a great picture, there are two things that are quite distracting:1) DO NOT set this up anywhere where you run the risk of \"glare.\" I have a very bright living room and I've found this creates a MASSIVE amount of glare on the television screen. My last TV had hardly any glare when it sat in the very same spot, where the Vizio's glare is borderline unbearable.2) There are SLIGHT background pixelation issues when there's \"movement\" during whatever show you're watching. I was watching NFL Network in HD and I noticed whenever they cut to action shots during games, the crowd/background would get a little pixelated. Honestly, overall I would say that for a \"High Definition\" television, I was a little disappointed at the quality of the picture as I flipped through the channels. The 4-year-old Philips I had previously seemed to have a slightly clearer picture.I still give this three starts because overall the picture still is decent; the colors are great and when there's not \"movement\" the quality of the picture is fantastic. Also, for the price it's a pretty good deal overall. However, I do admit that there is a part of me that's tempted to return it and upgrade to a Samsung or LG because when you're dropping several hundred dollars on a television you really want to \"love\" it and not feel \"meh\" about it.", "Date": "March 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Go America!", "Author": "pete card. \"Certero\"", "ReviewID": "R23C7ZJC230TYP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I gave the chance to this brand because I found out that is an American brand.

After some fairly extensive research, we decided on this TV and it is very good. The screen is large; the picture is sharp; it sips electricity sparingly; the viewing angles are generous; and the super-thin frame is barely noticeable. Our only complaint is that the settings that provide the deepest blacks and best contrast cause colors in the flesh-tone spectrum to shift to a much redder hue than they should be. Usually it only makes most actors/actresses look tan. Occasionally depending upon the lighting (in the video, not in the room) and the person, it can cause them to appear to be a nearly comical boiled-lobster red. My husband tried for about an hour to find a setting that would provide the good contrast without the lobster people but was unsuccessful. So occasionally we have a little laugh.Also worth noting - we had to pick this box up at the UPS facility. The box it ships in would not fit into the back seat of our midsize sedan (too tall to fit in the doors).

As of May 7, 2014, it is still not working.  We are very disappointed, as we watched a lot of videos on Amazon.  We have to go to our older TV to watch Amazon until it is fixed on the 2014 model.2.  At first, it took quite a long time to stream videos from Netflix.  When I called Vizio customer support, they were not very helpful.  We were not having any other issues with electronic devices connecting to our wireless internet.  But I called our internet provider.  They were able to change the settings on our internet so that the connection was much quicker.  They were surprised that they actually had to revert back to an older setting to make a 2014 TV work properly.  Whatever they did, it works very fast now.3.  We have a smaller, older version of a Vizio TV, so the TV was very familiar to us.  Although, it sure would be nice if the remote was easier to use for typing in search items.

Make sure you have all your passwords ready and you'll be up and running In a matter of minutes.  Streaming is smooth, it works great! Bonus! Netflix button on the remote!

I always liked the vizio brand with the quality that TV produced so figured I'd upgrade to the latest model Vizio with the smart TV features. After reading many reviews and different forums, I decided with the E550i-B2 and Amazon had a nice deal on it (Only buy it from here if it's sold by Amazon, the 3rd party sellers are $150-200 more.)Everything arrived in prefect condition. The delivery people were pretty good about turning the TV on to make sure everything was working before leaving. The setup on the TV was easy, picture calibration is easy. Netflix works flawlessly on it, no lag or anything weird. I even installed PS3 media server on my computer and the Multimedia app on the TV picks up the media server and I can stream video files straight to the TV from that!The only downside I've had so far is the sound. Because the speakers are behind the TV it sounds a little muffled and just isn't good audio. It's not terrible, but it's not good either. I'll probably invest in a sound bar to go with it. Also that the Amazon app still isn't ready for it yet, not sure why that hasn't been resolved yet.Overall, I think it's a pretty good buy for the price and would recommend it!After a couple of weeks of having the TV, I've settled on these picture settings:Auto Brightness: OFFBacklight: 100Brightness: 50Contrast: 90Color: 55Tint: 0Sharpness: 50Advanced Picture Settings:Color Temp: NormalBlack Detail: MediumActive LED Zones: OnMotion Blur Reduction: OnReduce Signal Noise: OffReduce Block Noise: OffFilm Mode: AutoA big thing to keep off is the Reduce Signal Noise.

The menu is easily navigated, and while the settings out of the box are pretty good, to get the best out of this TV, you'll probably want to tweak them a little. There is plenty of contrast, while retaining detail in the highlights and shadows. I don't know how it could be a better picture.I watched a baseball game, and there were 2 announcers. There was something about one of their voices that made the speakers sound \" tinny\". The other sounded fine. Background ( fan) noise made it difficult to hear the announcers. The good thing is that these problems were easily fixed by tweaking the audio settings, making the audio definitely acceptable, although not perfect.This set has been measured as best as I could to be 27 feet from the wireless router. There is a wall and a sofa between the router and TV. The first time I tried to stream content from Amazon prime, it took a little longer than I expected to begin. After the first few minutes, it was smooth sailing. I also have a Roku hooked up to another TV, which is about 10 feet from the router. I doubt very much that the Roku would perform as well as this wireless that is built-in to the TV, although this has not been tested.I have only had this TV for 4 days, so time will be the judge on longevity.I was not able to give 4 1/2 stars on performance, and I also can not give more than 5 stars on value, which I would if possible.", "Date": "April 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good TV but no web browser app.", "Author": "Supershrimp", "ReviewID": "RVY04OPBJQLVP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would have given this TV five stars had it had a really good web browser.

I fell in love with the very thin bezel and the picture (in the store). I also loved the SmartApp-dedicated buttons on the remote (no more having to talk my wife through changing inputs, etc.). I have no desire to \"bash\" this product, and I very well may have taken home a lemon unit, which I chose not to exchange. Your mileage may vary, but I can only attest to my experience with this television (that I purchased at a local shopping club that rhymes with clams).Once home, I struggled with what seemed to be one thing after another. Having already gone to the trouble of mounting the TV to our bedroom wall, it was with great angst that I decided to return it a week later.Here are the issues I encountered, ranked in order of my priority, from least to most:- The universal wall mount holes are very bottom-centric, meaning they're situated from the base, up to the center of the TV. If you mount this using a full motion bracket, it feels really \"flimsy\" on the mount (for lack of a better term) when you try to move it about.- I read spec.s and reviews to the contrary, but the viewing angles we experienced were terrible. Even slightly off center viewing resulted in an extremely washed out, ghost-like picture. Our bedroom is rather large and has room to either side for viewing the TV. This just didn't look very good at all from anywhere but the center of the room.- The IR sensor at the base of the TV is entirely too weak. I've seen others write about this issue, and I can certainly confirm that it's really bad. It often took several frustrating mashes of the buttons to perform any function. I experienced the same poor reactions using our DirecTv remote, which confirmed it was the receiver and not the remote or poor batteries. While on the subject of remotes, I would add that the loud \"click, click, click\" noise from all of the remote buttons was rather annoying to listen to and conjured up some not-so-great memories of the old \"channel changers\" of the seventies.- The final straw was the wifi connection. I had no trouble seeing or signing onto my 50MB wireless LAN. In fact, the TV would consistently show 4 out of 4 bars for the signal strength. However, I couldn't get the TV to maintain the connection for more than a few minutes at a time - ever. I tried for hours with their customer service help desk, but we never were able to identify or fix the issue.I realize this is a newer model, and I think Vizio's features, cost, & value ratios are spot-on in this series. I really hope that they can correct most or all of these issues with firmware updates (none were available when I checked). As I said, I really struggled with deciding to return this TV, but I did. I replaced it with another, 2 letter, brand for roughly the same price, and having installed the replacement, I have to tell you that it was hands-down the right decision.", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not a good TV.

Buttons are not that responsive. I find myself pushing the bottons more than once. Typing in keywords i.e in youtube or netflix is a PITA. Too fustrating. Be prepared to hate your remote after a few searches. I have a PS 3 so I use that to watch movies via netflix/amazon.2. The Blacks in idle mode- when the tv is in 'no input' detected mode, the screen is black. Ive noticed the screen kind of blotchy, meaning there are lighter blotches of black within the black. Not an even black across the screen. It only looks that way when 'no input\" is detected.3. Lighting around bezel edge- When you look at the screen from the side I did notice lights coming through the bezel. It maybe the cause of the slimmer bezel. Nothing distracting but kind if weird you can see the tv led lighting showing through when viewed by side (its rare you will ever watch tv on its side).So overall the TV is great!!!

I complained to Amazon's leadership that their ad was misleading because it states that the TV works with Amazon Prime, but they currently have the knowledge that it does not (FYI: other 2014 models are also affected). Then, days later, a note on the top of this product page stated that Amazon Prime was not working. But now, I have come back a couple of weeks later for my review, only to see they removed the heads-up to the consumer (and the issue is not resolved as of 4/11/2014).So, as for the quality of the TV itself.. I would say the malfunctioning app, false advertising by both Amazon and Vizio (and in addition, their childish finger pointing games at each other).. these things are enough to bring this down to 3 stars.With that said, Amazon provided me with a work around option.. Simply because of servicing me as a customer, I felt obligated to not bump this down to 1-2 stars. Outside of this, I'm sure it's a good TV.. but I'm a cable cutter (only using Amazon Prime), thus the TV was a brick to me till they made it right.I feel obligated to inform others since Amazon took it upon themselves to reverse their decision of notifying their customers. It seems to me it was a blatant move to hide these issues.. which appears was in favor of selling TVs?I'll update this review when it is confirmed resolved.

I was told that I would have to either disable my WiFi network (then what would deb the point of an internet TV) or disable the Network or File sharing function of my WiFi network.

This model was introduced in between Mid January/Early February 2014 over at Costco and available right now at VIZIO's main website. PLEASE TRY AND REFRAIN FROM BEING A FANBOY, I give you my word I am being as honest and objective as I possibly can be and I am giving you the most accurate detailing that I can provide. This review is from my personal experience with this TV set.I recently had the opportunity to go and stay over at the home of a friend for a period of 3 weeks who had purchased the 2014 VIZIO FALD E500i-B1 and was allowed to familiarize myself with this set in it's entirety. First allow me the pleasure of telling you that the picture quality regarding the brightness, colors and contrast levels of this Television in comparison to the edge-lit E500i-A1 can go from far better to absolutely astoundingly and astonishingly drop dead gorgeous when given the very best calibration possible. I used the  Spears & Munsil HD Benchmark and Calibration Disc 2nd Edition BLU-RAY disc that I own to calibrate the TV.I have also used the calibration disc on my own personal TV and it is a superb calibration disc in terms of the results you can achieve with it by DIY and it's price in comparison to a professional calibration job.HOWEVER THAT IS NOT THE REASON I AM GIVING THIS SET 2 STARS.I am giving this Television set 2 stars because it is plagued and affected by the exact same issues that destroyed the experience for me with the 2 edge-lit E500i-A1's that I previously owned, and also affected the edge-lit E601i-A3 and the E701i-A3 that I also personally witnessed happen(THIS HAPPENED SO MUCH THAT VIZIO FAMOUSLY ISSUED A RECALL ON BOTH TELEVISION MODELS). The issues being the Television would lose the HDMI Signal every 5-15 minutes for 3-5 seconds and then the Picture would return, interestingly You could still hear the audio, The HDMI INPUT PORTS in question are 3&4. The other issue is that it still suffered from very minimal edge light bleed, and yes FALD displays can still suffer from edge light bleed. For example in the edge-lit M601d-A3R as well as this new for 2014 FALD E500i-B1 if you look up close carefully along the edges you can see some of the light bulbs. That is due to Subpar Manufacturing Practices, essentially the panel placement methods aren't as best as they can be, in the case of the E500i-B1's light bleed it has nothing to do with it being a FALD display, although light bleed is more pronounced on edge-lit displays, light bleed isn't due to a display being edge-lit it has more to do with the method of manufacturing. There are currently many edge-lit and FALD displays that have absolutely zero light bleed. The last issue is also rather bothersome and disheartening that it plagues this model just like the edge-lit E500i-A1, and that is the occasional ghosting/clouding. It happens often enough that it is going to be very noticeable with certain and frequently watched programs.IN CLOSING.....Ladies and Gentlemen, at this point these issues have to be attributed to POOR VIZIO QUALITY CONTROL substandard parts and careless manufacturing Standards & Practices. Remember 3 other models have been plagued and affected by these exact same issues that I can personally attest to witnessing, the edge-lit E500i-A1, E601i-A3, E701i-A3 and finally the \"new for 2014\" FALD E500i-B1. Personally speaking I am honestly not able to tell you if this affects other 2014 E-series models but I definitely can attest to dealing with this problem on this E500i-B1 model during my extended stay at my friends home. The idea that this is still happening in the year 2014 among VIZIO E-Series Televisions is quite alarming and should give any potential customer a momentary and cautionary pause because clearly THE QUALITY CONTROL OF THE E-SERIES PLAIN AND SIMPLY IS STILL NOT THERE. In my personal opinion It is rather unfortunate because as described in the second paragraph the Picture Quality when properly calibrated can be astonishing for the price, however the PQ in this television does not make up for the very serious and noticeable issues that still plague the E-Series line. VIZIO's very slow firmware updates can only do but so much to improve things. In my experience firmware updates can introduce or take away features and can even improve certain software faults, but historically HDMI signal loss and Light Bleed are a faulty hardware(HDMI inputs) and build quality problem(Light Bleed) that a firmware update simply will not be able to fix. A firmware update might be able to address the Ghosting/Clouding issue, but based on VIZIO firmware update history, then it is a high probability the issue will  NOT BE RESOLVED as illustrated and proven by the edge-lit E500i-A1, E601i-A3, E701i-A3 that I can personally attest to witnessing and other E-Series & M-Series models that are still dealing with the issue.If you are definitely interested in the new 2014 50\" VIZIO models then you should wait for the 50\" VIZIO 1080p M-Series M502i with 32 zones of FALD local dimming expected to cost $729.99USD or the 50\" VIZIO Ultra High Definition P-Series P502ui with 64 zones of FALD local dimming expected to cost $1000.00USD or under. The M-Series has been known to be \"slightly better\" than the E-series in terms of build and picture quality. As far as the new for 2014 P-Series is concerned, there isn't any reliability, build or picture quality testing data available, but a year of availability on the market should hopefully provide some by research labs like Consumer Reports as an example, but as far as the P-Series is concerned, it is expected to be the better of the 3 model lines when available according to the \"Professional Reviews Media and Press\". Otherwise I would skip VIZIO until vast & definitely needed Quality Control and manufacturing Standards & Practices improvements are introduced amongst the E-Series model line. If you don't care about frequent HDMI Signal loss, Light Bleed and Ghosting/Clouding problems then by all means get this Television set. At least you can say \"the Picture Quality is good for the price\". Once again so unfortunate for a TV with great PQ.I usually do not consider an extended warranty in regards to TV's to be necessary, but given VIZIO's history, if AMAZON offers an extended warranty please do consider one for your own peace of mind. Thank You potential AMAZON Customers for taking the time to read this Customer Review.**UPDATE**April 5, 2014This model is now available at VIZIO's main website as well as Target and it's website.**UPDATE**April 17, 2014Improved the details and fixed typographical errors.This model is now available at TIGERDIRECT's main website.**UPDATE**April 25, 2014More improvements to details and fixing of typographical errors.Now available by some \"AMAZON RESELLERS\" over $150.00USD extra dollars. Please don't succumb. The VIZIO MSRP of this model is $599.99USD and is sold by AMAZON at $599.99USD and eventually will be in better stock supply and/or rotation in the weeks ahead by all major retailers. Most major retailers are trying to sell/get rid of their edge-lit E500i-A1 model stock before they introduce the 2014 FALD E500i-B1 model stock.**UPDATE**April 29, 2014This model is now available at Bestbuy and it's website.", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "BUY A DIFFERENT TV LEMON!!

She then promised me that if the issue occurred again, they would send a different comparable model.The Third tv has the same issue. I called today to have them send a different model and the phone tech said they wanted to send a tech onsite to do diagnostics. I informed her that the last tech that was here observed my setup and said there was no reason why my environment would cause this issue. She said that they wont send a different model unless they come onsite to do this. AGAIN. I asked to speak to easily one of the WORST most UNPROFESSIONAL Managers I have ever spoken to. He constantly would interrupt me, telling me this is an issue with my environment and not their under-engineered, poorly tested, vaporware tv's.  He said he would not honor the last customer service representatives promise and would put in for a request to refund me and I have to wait until Monday for that approval. He said that if it wasn't approved, they would have to send a tech to seek out an environmental cause. I used to be a huge vizio fan.

I shouldn't have to make such drastic adjustments.  Their customer support was great, by the way. They offered to exchange the TV but I decided to return it to Amazon since I had it less than 30 days.  Amazon replaced it within a couple of days (can't beat their customer service, UPS picked up the TV).The second TV's picture was better - it was adjustable.  But I still had to make such drastic adjustments with the presets.  Would get a good picture on one HD channel, switch to another HD channel and I'd have to adjust the picture again!  I just could not get that crisp clear picture you should get from an LED TV.  My Samsung LCD 720p had a far better picture.  I guess you could get someone to come in to calibrate it at some extra cost, which defeats the purpose of buying the low price TV.  Or get one of those discs people talk about - I don't have a blue ray player so that was not an option for me.The unit is solid, though very plasticky.  Stand wobbles.  Positive thing about the TV is that it is very easy to set up.  Didn't like the remote - buttons too small, plus you have to point it directly at the TV, and I mean directly, otherwise nothing happens.I watch a lot of TV and there were too many cons to contend with.  I returned the unit and spent extra to purchase the LG 47LB6300 which has turned out to be quite perfect.  Chose one preset setting, adjusted the color and have not had to touch it since.

I really, really wanted to like this TV.However, I had big color calibration issues. With my Roku3, my main device, they were major. Fleshtones were incredibly red and other colors were also way off. None of the built-in picture modes corrected this (Calibrated Black was my baseline, since it was supposed to be very good right out of the box). I tried manual adjustments. I tried a factory reset on the TV. I pulled up the color bar test patterns in the TV, and saw that the white/yellow bars were green, and all the other colors were off too. Weird!I emailed Vizio and sent them pictures of the color bar patterns, but all they could suggest was a power cycle and a factory reset, both of which I'd already done. Assuming I got a dud, I called Amazon tech support and arranged a replacement. TV #2 had the same problem. Noooooo!!! Then I tried the color bar test pattern on my Blu-ray player, and it looked just like it should. What...? I unplugged the Blu-ray and plugged in the Roku3 (same TV input, same calibration settings, same HDMI cable) - weird color problems again. Then I swapped in my old LG television - same Roku, colors are fine.Emails to Roku's customer support resulted in finger-pointing at the TV, since it works fine with the LG. Vizio likewise doesn't believe it's their problem. Unhappy with the clown colors on every show, I reluctantly decided the second set had to go back.The big plus was how good Amazon's 30 day tech support is. They picked up right away late at night, listened to the problem and what I'd tried to fix it, offered smart advice, and ultimately great support for the return including UPS pickup.

On the TV, it ranged from 384k to 4Mbps (on rare occasion). As a result, the picture quality streaming from Netflix was unacceptable.

To the point that when I was using it, my whole home\u2019s network speeds would slow to a snail\u2019s pace. I'd Turn off the TV and things were back up to speed.So, in the end, two failed attempts at a \u201csmart\u201d solution have led me to go with a not-so-gifted (aka \"dumb\") TV paired with the ever reliable Apple TV.It just seems like Smart TVs are trying to do too much too soon.

It seems I was not able to use the apps due to speed of internet connection.  I raised my speed and now the apps that I have tested do work with no problems.  Netflix and You Tube both loaded and ran with no issues.  The sound is good and it looks slim and sleek. I will be contacting my satellite provider to come out to check the cables and see if I can get a better picture since I do not have an HD receiver and programming.  However, since the local channels do air in HD, I should be able to have a better picture than I do. I'm sure when viewing DVD's on a blue ray player, the picture will be fantastic. I don't want to knock Vizio, as my daughter has had one for about 5 years now with no issues. I still think that Vizio offers a great product for the money.  I also must say that delivery was made sooner than I expected to receive it, so very happy with shipping/receiving experience as well. Amazon is a great place to shop!Initial Review - I just installed my new Vizio tv yesterday.  To my dismay, since I don't have an HD receiver, I will now have to obtain one, as the picture is not that great without it.  What really upsets me though, is the fact that the Apps do not work.  It recognized my wireless router, however, the Apps that I have tried are not working. Netflix takes a bit to load, then it takes a bit to be able to pick a movie.  When I tried playing a few movies, none of them would actually play.  It just kept buffering and then just froze.  Each time, I would get a message saying it appears that movie is not working correctly and I should try selecting another.  After three movies, I quit.  My tablet will play the movies, but not this Vizio.  If I can't get it to work, I will have no choice but to return it.

No big.)Sound isn't bad, I saw the reviews about the not-so-great sound/audio. It doesn't sound too bad.There's an EQ you can play with if you think the audio is too flat.RELATIVELY easy set up (see below...)Cons (mostly customer service, not product):TV has started to freeze sometimes (i.e. when changing between TV to App, or App to App) Only owned and functioning for about 3 weeks/1 month.. so I hope this will be extremely rare.No Skype.Packaging \"layout\" needs to be improved - The \"neck\" of the TV (piece that attaches screen to the base) was taped to the corner  of the box and not very visible. We thought the piece was missing, and almost threw it out. Which leads to...Unacceptable customer service (Vizio, not Amazon) -  we called about the missing piece, and were told it would be here in 8 business days.Firstly, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? If it was actually missing, that kind of turnaround is UNACCEPTABLE. I'm paying for prime, and the 2-day shipping. We want to watch our TV AS SOON AS IT ARRIVES.Secondly, this isn't a case of warranty parts. This is ORIGINAL PARTS, in ORIGINAL PACKAGING. You failed to include a vital  piece, you should overnight the cursed part to me. The shipping label should have been printing as I \"yelled\" at you over the phone.Thirdly, the piece took FOUR WEEKS to arrive. Bravo Vizio. You suck.

So far I'm really pleased with the picture and the way the TV generally works. I do have an issue with the WiFi setup.

I really want my Wifi network to be as secure as current standards allow.UPDATE: It's better than I thought. Within the manual Network setup screens is the ability to enter a 50 character WPA2 passphrase which while not the full 63 characters should be plenty secure. I learned this info from Bruce who answered my question about the passphrase character limits in the Customer Questions and Answers section; so, a big thank you to Bruce. Here is what Bruce had to say:\"You will have to skip the steps in the automated setup. If you push the menu button on the remote, then select network in the menu, then select your network, then it will allow you to enter a password of whatever length you need. You will probably have to first agree to the terms of service before doing the first steps I spelled out.\"Now, as for VIZIO customer service: they answered my email in about 3 hours (incorrectly as it turns out). It's possible that I didn't ask the question precisely enough, and you could say that the answer was literally correct in that the passphrase is limited to 23 characters within the initial setup wizard.

It is far from best quality in picture, connecting to internet, 100% dependency on remote control and especially very weak channel info.To be fair it is being compared to a 6 year old Samsung 52\".  The Samsung always had an immediate good picture and when a black and white movie was on a simple picture display fixed the darkness.  The screen always had a real black background, the visio has absolutely no all-black background even though it says it does. We enjoy antennae TV and the Samsung shows what is, and will-be, playing on each station without clicking on the channel.  The Visio only shows what is currently playing on the channel being watched.  The Samsung has well hidden touch buttons that let you control the TV without the remote. The Visio cannot even be turned off without the remote (LOSE THE REMOTE AND YOU HAVE TO UNPLUG THE TV TO TURN IT OFF).  The Samsung will be playing a Blue Ray disc or other Connection and when your done you can simply click the channel up/down and it moves the connection to regular TV and the Visio needs to be guided through multiple steps to reconnect to the channels. The Samsung remote works pointing it anywhere in the direction of the TV even 20 feet away and the Visio remote only works pointing it at the lower left corner and you have to be close.  I have spent a lot of time (hours on and off during over 12 movie sessions) trying to get a decent picture but the contrast has never hit 'B' quality and the Samsung spoiled us with 'A+' quality.Now - Smart TV.  The bragging right was how wonderful it is to connect to the internet.  The Visio found the Wireless exactly like the few weak pages of instructions showed and it connected.  But NONE of the Internet apps can find an internet connection.  The error is there is no internet connection - yet - even the very very weak detailed manual that is built into the TV shows the Visio is indeed connected to the internet with great bandwidth.  There is no blockage on the router so the problem is 100% Visio. The troubleshooting section of the manual for the apps indicate to connect to the internet (no help).I have not called anyone because we have other access means to Smart apps that always worked wireless and no issues (on a Samsung Blue Ray).This is the 1st major disappointment with Amazon's reviews and we have shared our dislike with Visio to family and friends.
