{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very good TV for a very good price", "Author": "D. Maerz", "ReviewID": "REX0RSDU6YV25", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently bought this TV from Amazon after having done a lot of research, and viewing different TVs in the store. For its price range this TV offers the best picture and depth of colors of all of the TVs I compared. The main decision I had to make was between this and the Samsung 46UNC6500, which when I did a side by side of them, the colors and picture looked much richer on the 820UN.For those wondering, the difference between the 820 and 810UN is a glass screen on the 820, which gives a \"better\" contrast ratio and adds about 15 lbs to the weight. Regardless, the TV is not particularly heavy and I set it up, lifted it out of the box, walked about 40ft, and put it on a TV stand at belly button height, with relative ease.Pros:Easily the best picture I've seen on a TV in this price rangeExcellent color display and very rich colors (personally I don't know if the added yellow pixel makes a big difference macroscopically, but the TV looks very nice) Other review sites noted a richer color display and some gained energy efficiency from the 4th color addition (CNET [did not review TV, but previewed Quattro technology] and Flat Panel Reviews)Nice design aesthetics, the TV looks very attractive and has nice cut buttons that are flush with the display (think PS3 buttons)Very affordable priceI have not tried out the Apps yet, but the TV can act as a Netflix browserSet has little blooming (I noticed none) for an LCD display, colors do not wash blue on the edges like the Samsung I viewed didCons:I do not feel the stand is super stable, but only time will tellThe glass screen is SUPER reflective, if you are going to be watching this in a room that has ample sunlight on the screen, I would think about going for the 810 or a non-glass screen TV. The picture is beautiful, but the depth of the black will be ruined when the screen is acting like a mirror during dark scenesTo the above comment, my room is really well lit, but when I turn the lights down, the glass is no longer a problem, so as long as you have good control over the lights, don't worry.Overall the TV was a great buy, and I couldn't be happier with it.", "Date": "October 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "my goodness", "Author": "jake", "ReviewID": "R3MWAVQVU8CC02", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this t.v. is some serious tech. i actually have a 65\" sharp as my t.v., so i use the 46\" quattron as my computer monitor (you think i am crazy right, but you would be amazed what screen size you can get away with once you get the screen suited to your eyes after tweaking the settings). first, the screen is incredibly thin. absurdly thin is a more accurate description. it puts out next to zero heat, i mean none. it also sucks very little power and the screen instantly achieves full brightness when it's turned on. the controls on the front of the television are actually touch sensitive, though it took me days to realize this. stupid i know. it also comes with a very capable video controller.the picture is truly amazing. the fourth color being added to the gambit actually makes a noticeable difference. you will definitely notice more vibrant colors from standard 3 color pixel sets. the contrast ratio is blindingly high with these LED back lit t.v.'s. this set blows my 65\" set's contrast ratio out of the water, but the 65\" is fluorescent back lit, so it's inferior tech because it's older. blu-rays on this t.v. are amazing. once you go high def, there's no going back. the speakers the television comes with are surprisingly powerful, though i am using the harmon/kardon sound sticks as my primary system. if you are looking for the latest in cutting edge technology for LCD t.v.'s, then you owe it to yourself to go with sharp, they are the mercedes benz of televisions and the 46\" edge lit quattron is certainly following sharp's impeccable reputation. i would highly recommend this t.v. for people who are serious about t.v.'s.", "Date": "February 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Home Entertainment at its best.", "Author": "Happy Dad", "ReviewID": "R2JEN464MAR3J6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After doing alot of research and seeing the competition in person; this 46LE820 came out hands down the best TV for the price and size that I could ever dream of. The resolution and picture accuracy is amazing! The settings are a lot of fun and easy to use.
