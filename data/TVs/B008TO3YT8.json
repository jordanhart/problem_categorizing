Since this is such a high end product I figure it deserves an extensive review so I will be updating this as time goes on.Installation: WHOA. You really don't realize how large a 46 inch television is until you have to lift it up, flip it around, and attach the base to the bottom. I guess you probably have to do this with most televisions of this nature? Anyway I will say that the Seiki is relatively light for something so large. Light and THIN. Holy Cow is it thin! So the installation of the base is sort of a pain but it goes quickly enough. The base itself is flimsy plastic. I am concerned about the stability of the television. It hasn't rocked or wobbled or anything yet but if someone knocks into the television by accident I don't have the greatest faith in its ability not to fall over and ruin my day. The screws that connect the base to the Seiki are also pretty flimsy. I'm considering purchasing a wall mount. It seems like a safer alternative. Attaching the base will take five minutes top and then you have to find somewhere to place your SUPER LARGE TV!Set-Up: I am not a tech-minded person. I live in the wrong era. Setting up the Seiki could have been a nightmare for me. It was not. The process was quick and easy, it probably took another two minutes and then TADA! You're ready to enjoy your SUPER LARGE TV!Enjoying Your SUPER LARGE TV: I love the picture on the Seiki. I love the colors. We watched Joss Whedon's The Avengers on this beast and it was the next best thing from seeing it in theaters. We have also played lots and lots and lots of Borderlands 2 on the X-Box 360 and it is epic. We do split screen co-op multiplayer and despite the fact that the screen is split in half, on the Seiki it doesn't hinder the quality. I find this particularly awesome.So far things are going great. I really love this TV. Complaints are minimal (until someone knocks this thing over and shatters my hopes and dreams all over the floor) and the picture quality is great. The Seiki is thin and (relatively) light. Installation and set-up is easy as cake (good for we who are less than technologically adept). I will warn you that I have seen complaints regarding the retail/home mode on not just this Seiki but others. I have yet to have any such problems but again, I'll update this as I get a better feel for it.***UPDATE***I've decided to update the TV to 5 stars (from 4). The only reason I hadn't given the Seiki a perfect score to begin with was the volume but I've informed this can be remedied with some external speakers. Again, I'm not a tech-minded person and this was my first HDTV so sorry about that. The Seiki has been a great TV from the start. I haven't had any troubles with it and it was especially appreciated during this last hockey season.", "Date": "October 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Seiki LED TV", "Author": "Thomas P. Troyer", "ReviewID": "R3JX8FOYW406Y2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the Seiki 46\" LED TV for about two weeks and it is a bedroom TV with no externals added such as DVD player, etc. The picture is very clear and bright. The sound is somewhat better than most flat screen TV's but not what you would find with a sound system or even the old big box TV's with the larger speakers.  I will start with set up: it was easy to unpack the TV and attach the stand. I haven't bought many big TV's and perhaps they all come packed the way the Seiki was packed. When I removed the straps around the box, the whole box lifted up over the TV, very nice. The set-up guide was very easy to use and worked without a hitch. It was easy to get both the over air stations and to get the Satellite dish hooked up.  The set does have three HDMI ports, a PC audio and VGA port for hooking up to a PC, a RF and a Coaxial port for aerial or audio receiver. It also has the usual ports for game consoles, etc. Since I am not using anything except for the one HDMI for the dish and an aerial port for the over air stations, I cannot review any other hookups.  The set has the usual settings in the menu for adjusting the video, audio, child proofing, etc. The remote is easy to use and functions in a natural way, though I programed the dish remote so I only have to use the one remote for both. The only comparisons that I can make with other TVs is between another 46\" Sharp TV which is about 6 years old and the old Toshiba \"big box\" TV that this replaces. The Seiki is clearer than the Sharp and has better everything than the old Toshiba. The sound is almost as good as the Toshiba it replaces. The LED picture seems clear, bright and has a very good range of color and contrast. Blacks are black. Viewing from the side angles seems very good though this will be viewed straight away for me.  The one thing that would be a negative for me if I used it in the living room is that it has the shiny, reflective screen like the plasma TVs. Since I use it in the bedroom primarily at night, this is not an issue. My living room is very bright with windows opposite the TV so my best option there is the LCD rather than this LED.  Overall I couldn't be happier with this TV unless it somehow got great sound out of little speakers. I expected the sound quality to be less than a good sound system and that is what I got. With the very reasonable price of the Seiki on Amazon, I can afford a sound bar if I wish.  I strongly recommend this TV.", "Date": "October 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "5 Star Quality - No less", "Author": "Gamer", "ReviewID": "R2BQU1X18DAYJK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all I want to say that anyone who rated this product less than 5 stars did so due to their own incompetence of technology.SCREEN:I can honestly say that this screen has the best color, clarity, contrast, and resolution that I have ever seen. I'm sure there are better screens out there, but for this price, it is completely Amazing. I couldn't take my eyes off of it when I put on the first 1080p HD video for a test run.SPEAKERS:I can't believe how many people had the outrageous expectation that a (2\" thick) LED TV would somehow (magically?) sound like a Dolby 7.1 surround sound. I will not ever use the speakers built into this TV, and I never had the intention to. Actually, I'd rather they remove the speakers completely just to save a bit of money.Anyone looking for an LED TV should immediately understand that a 2\" thick TV will not have good speakers. You Must have a surround sound system that you intend to use with it. This is completely obvious and Not a reason to hinder the rating of the product.QUALITY:The TV was in perfect condition when delivered, and there were no issues hooking it up. It was a very simple plug-and-play. The casing itself is a quality plastic, and there is sheet of glass protecting the screen. The stand that it comes with does require you to put some screws into plastic, but if you are smart about it and you don't crank them in like a lug nut on a semi truck, the stand works very well and holds the (rather lightweight) TV with ease.Bottom line: The Best TV under $400.

I was a little hesitant to go through with the purchase, especially when this is a brand I am not familiar with.  Well, so far, so good!  The TV was easy to unpack and putting the stand on was easy also.  Set-up was quick and I didn't have any problems.  I've had it set up for three days, I wanted to make sure everything ran well before I wrote a review.  So far I am happy.  The picture is sharp and the colors rich in HD.  The one minus in my opinion is that the sound is kind of tinny but I had a sound system already and once I hooked that up it's all good. That's the reason for four stars.  All in all, for the price this is a pretty good tv.

However,the cheap price comes with a cost.*Picture quality during HD playback seems quite good. Like most other LED televisions, picture and settings will need to be adjusted to get the most out of the experience. I found the \"movie\" picture preset to be a good starting point.*Bright scenes tend to be colorful and vibrant. No complaints.*TV does not do well with SD cable, although this is normal for many LED/LCD HDTVs.*Sound is sub-par at best, but can be remedied via external sound systems.**The biggest issue with this set in my opinion is back light bleed (especially in corners). I returned the first set as I deemed the extent of the bleed to be unacceptable. During normal viewing the experience is often ruined by the pervasiveness of light bleeding through into the picture, destroying the atmosphere and mood of dimly lit and dark scenes. Once you see it, it cannot be unseen. You will find your eyes being pulled away from the picture to focus on what appears to be the soft glow of little street lamps extending out in a fan pattern from the corners of the television set. The replacement I received had similar issues, though just slightly less extensive than the first. Other reviewers have pointed this out as well, and unfortunately this seems to be the norm with this set.The response from Seiki Tech Support regarding this issue:you can not compare lcd with led.  led is the backlight. you will have bleed through. lcd does not have led lights. just has one long light bulb. example. lcd: one long blun at top and shoots light all the way down. led: 10000 led lights that fill the screen  so there is no compares-en . this is why you can tell. there is nothing that can be done.--  JerryTech SupportIn closing,this TV gets the job done at a cheap price. It's thin, light, has and has the potential for good quality HD playback with a little tweaking. It shines during bright, colorful scenes, but disappoints during dark moody scenes due to back light bleed issues.

We didn't have to adjust anything whatsoever and picture was perfect.  (TV does NOT come with anHDMI cable so you might want to order one). I will say that out of everything the sound was very disappointing. Muffled voices, and lousy volume control via the tv itself. Still worth quite a bit more than we paid. So I  would highly recommend a seperate sound source. You can find very nice soundbars or Logitech systems has a fairly inexpensive home theatre surround system.

If you stop and think about the fact that you can get this 46\" LED HDTV for something around $350- which is about what a friend of mine paid for a 19\" RCA tube 30 years ago- you probably should thank your lucky stars if the thing even powers on, let alone displays an actual picture. But the 46\" Seiki achieves both, and even goes a bit farther.  Here are a few observations:1) Vivid colors, but be prepared to tweak the factory settings for brightness, contrast etc. My picture was crummy out of the box, and I was pleasantly surprised at the improvement after spending 1/2 hour on adjustments. Still have a bit more to do.2) Definite LED backlight bleed in the corners with dark scenes- expect it, deal with it, or spend more $$.3) Have some HD material on hand for your test drive- this set, like many HDTVs, does not do particularly well with SD (are you listening, Netflix?).4) Sports look just ok, not great, but part of that may be the artifact associated with internet streaming rather than actual motion blurring.5) Viewing angles are excellent (although why anyone would want to watch outside of 45 degrees is \"beyond\" me.)6) If you're using this with a pc and hdmi cable- hopefully your video card allows you to adjust the scaling (overscan/underscan), otherwise part of the image may be cut off. It took me awhile to make this adjustment in Catalyst Control Center because the necessary HD resolution wasn't initially listed, but I got it done. Otherwise this would have been a deal breaker since the TV is hooked up only to my computer.7) PC text is acceptable, but not as crisp as on a larger Sharp Aquos, even after adjusting Clear Type several times.8) If you're mounting on a wall- inexplicably the set is built such that the power cord interfered with placement of my VESA 400 x 400 mounting bracket. I had to use spacers to clear the cord, so the TV is about 3/4\" farther from the wall than it needs to be.9) I have no idea what the speakers sound like and never intend to find out.10) The remote is very basic and I like it that way.So is this really a 4 star HDTV? No, without taking price into account it's a 3 star tv, but considering the cost it earns every bit of 4 stars.  If you're looking for a set for your living room (or main viewing area) and have some extra cash laying around then I'd definitely buy something better. But if cash is tight then go ahead and put the Seiki front and center.

I was very hesitant to buy what I considered to be an off-brand TV but have been very pleased with my purchase. I haven't noticed the 60hz refresh being a problem at all, I honestly can't tell the difference between 60hz and 120hz. The color needs to be calibrated but such will be the case with any new TV. Altogether the picture is gorgeous and huge.The sound quality isn't spectacular but if you want spectacular sound you probably shouldn't use built-in speakers on any TV.The one drawback I'm frustrated with is in the settings--there's no way to turn off overscan on HDMI inputs. What this means is if you plug your computer in to the TV through HDMI the image will fall off the screen on all sides, losing about 5% of your image. The only way to correct for this is apparently manually resizing the output on your video card and losing 1920x1080 pixel-to-pixel matching. According to the internet, apparently major brands like Samsung have an auto-detection mode that corrects for this. Seiki does not, and Seiki customer service has not returned my e-mails requesting a solution.Picture: Great. Sound: OK. Settings: Lacking. Don't get this one if you plan to use it frequently hooked up to a computer input.Edit: Attempted to work with Seiki customer and tech support, they were immensely UNHELPFUL.

This TV failed about 6 months after purchase.  The HDMI ports suddenly stopped working and would not transmit any picture, yet the VGA cable still would show a picture.  I contacted Square Trade about redeeming my warranty and they told me to first contact Seiki.  After 3 or so ingnored e-mails, I got through by phone and a Seiki representative told me to send it back to them and they would send another, except that I must pay for the shipping back to them.  The rep told me it wouldn't be much - about 50.00.  I checked with Fedex, UPS, and USPS and the cheapest price I can get is about 150.00.  It is crazy to pay this much for another TV made with Seiki's poor quality.  And what, pay another 150.00 in six months for another poorly made TV?  Square Trade gave me my purchase back when they heard how awful Seiki's warranty is.  They said they didn't want the TV and I could do with it what I chose.  I got a new circuit board online for about $72.00, the board that holds the HDMI ports, and installed it in the defective TV.  I figured since I got my money back, I would take a 72.00 chance on it only lasting 6 months, or maybe still not working at all.  But it's been over a month now and it's been working fine with the new circuit board.  I've learned a valuable lesson, though.-Seiki is a company that punishes the consumer for trusting their product and a company from which I will never buy another TV.  I would also guess that Seiki often makes a product that fails to meet people's expectations.  Why else would they discourage people from returning defective products?-Square Trade is an awesome company that I will definitely do business with again.-Cheap TVs are a risk that may or may not turn out to be worth it.  I'm going to spend more on a name brand with a better warranty policy for my future TV purchases because it just isn't worth the hassle.Original Post:I ordered this on 11-26-12 for $348.00.  I'd been price-watching since Black Friday and it seemed like the price was the lowest it was going to be.  I wanted this TV mainly for playing PS3 on and watching movies and TV shows on my thumb drive in the PS3.  I had bought another 26\" Seiki LED HDTV about a year previous and have been delighted with it - touch screen buttons on the TV and a great picture for about $140.00.  I thought it was a great deal then and I still do.  It's a really great TV with now flaws I've ever noticed.  So I expected great things from this Seiki.The first TV arrived destroyed during shipping.  UPS was to blame.  I could see that something heavy had sat on the box and punched through it, cracking the screen and popping the frame around the TV apart.  However, Amazon was great.  I printed out the return slip, took it to the UPS store and sent if off, and my new TV was on the way to me before I had even finished doing this.  This is why I love Amazon!  About 5 days later my new TV arrived, intact.The new TV was different from the old TV, at least as far as the base.  The base of the first TV was plastic, but had metal strips reinforcing it underneath.  The new one look the same, minus the metal strips.  Immediately I could see it wasn't as strong.  After putting it together, I could see that the TV was crooked.  The right corner of the TV was lower than the left about about an inch.  That's pretty crooked in my book.  I spent about an hour making little cardboard and paper shims to put between the base and the TV before screwing in the screws tight.  It took some trial-and-error to get it leveled.  I just wish I could have kept the old base.  Finally I got it so that the TV is straight and nobody from the front can see my modifications.  It's stable and I have no worries about it falling down or collapsing when bumped.  I move it around all the time to plug in PC HDMI plugs and it's fine.  It was just a pain to get it leveled.After fixing the base problem, I encountered another, more obnoxious problem.  The audio output is only coaxial and red/white stereo output.  My other Seiki had a 3.5mm headphone plug.  So I pulled out an adapter I had and hooked up the red/white stereo plugs to my computer speakers.  Much to my irritation, the sound worked fine, but the TV volume on the remote had no effect on the stereo output.  Turn up the volume on the remote and nothing happened on the stereo speakers, but the TV volume went up through it's much-discussed crappy speakers.  So I had to go out and buy speakers that had their own remote.  Now I have to keep the TV volume at zero and I have 3 remotes - one for the TV and one for the speakers, and one for my PS3.  Irritating that the TV wouldn't know when something was plugged into it and transfer all audio properties over to the external source.  I have not tried updating the firmware, so perhaps it could be fixed with that?  I sort of doubt it, but who knows?  I know my old Seiki was smarter than this right out of the box.The third problem is rather minor in my opinion.  On a black screen or dark scenes during a movie, there is minor white light bleed coming from the corners and 2-4 blotches and tracks in the middle of the screen, depending on the day.  I sounds bad, but it's really quite minor.  I have to point it out to guests who seem rather disinterested and either don't see it themselves or don't notice it as much as I do.  It's really not that bad, but I notice it when I'm looking for it.Other than these 3 problems, the TV is awesome.  Great picture in my opinion.  Bright, crisp, big, awesome.  Hasn't let me down in the past month, though I did by a 3 year warranty in case it does.  I'd buy this TV again in a heartbeat for what I paid for it.  For what it's going for now ($520.00), I'd never do it.  Some things are worth messing with and putting up with when you get a good deal.  For $520.00, though, I think you could do a lot better. Another name-brand TV for $500.00 might be a bit smaller, but you wouldn't have to buy new speakers, put pieces of paper in the stand, and notice vague white blotches in the dark scenes.  It's good, but not $520.00 good.  It's $350.00 great.", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "BUY IT!!!!", "Author": "RjBass", "ReviewID": "R22HSEKSWJO5VR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV on Black Friday when it was on sale for $349.99.  I got the free super saver shipping with it and was told it would take 5 to 7 business days to arrive.  Well it's Tuesday, only 4 full days since ordered and it is already hanging on my wall.  I can't believe this TV cost so little.  With it's Samsung screen and elegant black finish, this unit could easily sell for $600 plus if it weren't for the unknown brand name.  This TV looks amazing.  Fantastic color reproduction, everything works including the coax digital audio out which was a must for my system.  I have my Dish HD box, Blu-Ray, and Media Center PC all plugged into it via HDMI and it all just works.  Setup was a breeze.  It even came with mounting screws for wall mounting so putting it in place of my old tv was super easy.  No need to go to the hardware store to find the correct size screws.  As long as this thing holds out, I will say it was the best $349.99 I have spent in the last 10 years.Buyer be warned though.  Seiki is an unknown brand, and while it does have a Samsung screen, you have to wonder what parts they cheeped out on to get the price so low.  When ever you purchase a big box item like this from an unknown brand, get the extended warranty with it.  With the Black Friday discount, I got the TV and the 4 year warranty and still paid less than $400 for it all.My one complaint about this TV is not actually about Amazon or Seiki, it is actually about FedEx.

I had it professionally installed on the wall, higher than average height in relation to a sitting plateau. Due to elevation of the tv, the speakers are located on the bottom of the tv, wihin the bezel. This is important because the volume of the tv, believe it or not, can be loud. Volume to me regarding this tv, is no problem; actually, I have it on a very low volume while watching standard cable. (It is able to go quite loud, otherwise.)

I've now owned this TV for over 8 months (got it in November on sale for $399) so I feel like I've experienced anything that could go possibly wrong without it being due to age.I'll just break my review down into basic pros and cons instead of some huge paragraphs.Pros:Well packaged and handledPicture quality is amazing for the priceCons:Cheap plastic stand (not a concern if you intend on wall mounting)The TV shows white \"marks\" when the tv is on a full black screen. It's primarily in the corners. It's not noticeable when watching anything but when you change the input and the temporary black screen is shown, I notice it easily and worry about it for those few seconds and forget againThe TV takes awhile to change channels but that could be due to it being a cheaper TV so it's understandableThe HDMI inputs are poorly placed as 3 inches below the HDMI inputs, the TV curves out so it sometimes makes it cramped to fit certain HDMI cables inThe biggest con is that the TV randomly shuts off every now and then. I read a few things on Google about this and apparently it's due to a failing power supply but my situation doesn't fit. For me, it turns off maybe 2-3 times a day with no notice. It takes like 5 seconds before it's ready to respond again to the power button. But, all those other hours it's on, it works flawlessly. The issue is annoying to say the least especially when it has happened during the Superbowl and NBA Playoff games.All in all, you can see I have way more cons that I do pros but I like anybody else notice the bad more than the good.

Bright colors, however, look beautiful on this display.  Movement is a bit choppy, but again I don't have a good sense of whether all televisions with 60Hz refresh rates are similarly choppy or whether this one is worse than others.  Bottom line: If television were a big part of my life, I would have bought a more expensive set and been much more discriminating about the quality; but for my casual TV watching, I did want the 46-inch screen but otherwise was okay saving a few bucks and buying a model I knew might not be the best out there.", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Over all a good item for the price", "Author": "reza", "ReviewID": "R2ROMSY68OIN0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The coax male broke after the first time use, because it the ports are not secure enough.

I was skeptical at first but for 348 and free shipping I figured I would give it a try and send it back if I was unimpressed. I received the TV yesterday and had pretty low expectations for this off brand LED. I have to say that my assumptions were proven wrong fairly quickly. The 60hz refresh rate is a little slow and I could notice the difference when watching a basketball game compared to my Sharp, but not enough to justify the price difference. I will say that you are considering buying this for gaming or sports I would look elsewhere since the refresh rate and response time are lacking on this T.V., but if you simply want a large LED for the Master Bedroom or Playroom then this is a great deal, especially when you consider a 4 year warranty is less than 50 bucks. The colors on this set are not as vivid or deep as my Sharp but better than my old 32 inch JVC LCD that this TV replaced. I have this hooked up to a Direct TV HD box and it looks good, not amazing, but nice for the price range. I can't put enough emphasis on not getting this TV and expecting Samsung quality, it's simply not possible in this price range.  The only thing that I didn't like about the transaction is that the TV was delivered in the original box, so if you live in an Apartment leave a note to leave this at the front, otherwise hope you have honest neighbors.All-in-all I would say that this TV is a great buy at less than 350 for a 46 inch LED; I would suggest this TV for anyone looking for a nice secondary TV.  The manufacture site offers the remote codes to all major cable and satellite networks for the remote.Although it is an off brand it's a Japanese off brand, not Chinese.

Walker", "ReviewID": "R3C7QIENSNXKUQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Consider this an \"in progress\" review.I received the television today, and am attempting to set it up. I'm failing miserably, and I don't think it's my fault. The television powers on, the colors seem fine, I can get things to display... but the horizontal and vertical settings are way off. Regardless of input source (I've tried a blu-ray player and a computer), I can't get the full display to show on the television. It stretches off the viewable area in an annoying way. Adjusting zoom settings doesn't help. According to the not-so-adequate manual that came with the television, there are adjustment options in the setup menu specifically for this. Under the 'advanced' tab. Which I can see in the menu. But it's grayed out and inaccessible. While selecting things with the arrow keys, that option gets skipped right over, as do several other options within the menu.At first I thought I was in \"retail\" mode (rather than \"home\" mode), since I didn't get the setup wizard I was supposed to when I first turned on the television. But I've accessed that finally (after a factory reset), but to no avail. I even found the secret service menu, did a genuine factory service reset, and that didn't help either. Nor did Initializing the EEPROM (another service option), which is yet another way to get a genuine reset. The control to fix the problem I'm experiencing is still inaccessible.Anyway, this is frustrating. I'll need to call the company and see what they say. After that, I'll update this review. In the meantime, I'd strongly suggest avoiding this television. I love my Vizio. Never had an issue with it, and setup was a breeze. The manual was significantly better as well.**Edit#1: Nothing positive to add yet, but I've watched a couple episodes of Star Trek:Voyager on the TV thanks to Amazon's excellent prime video service, and the \"image persistence\" on this television is horrible. Any dark scene shows leftover image remnants from the past 10 seconds or so worth of light and dark spots. The remnant images go away eventually, only to be replaced by new ones. They're most visible in any dark scene, and especially obvious when it goes to a black screen. I can't imagine other televisions are this bad, I never saw anything similar on my prior/other television.

These days however, TV's especially don't last as long as they used to so brand name isn't as important to me anymore. I've had LCD, plasma and LED TVs made by very well known and reputable brands that just don't last as long as those \"old school\" tube TV's used to. This particular TV replaced one of those \"old school\" tube TV's that's 12 years old and still works great, but I can't change the aspect ratio on it so sports scores during a game are almost all out of frame. Kinda frustrating.I was looking for a 42\" in the $400 range and came across this TV in a local big box store ad. After reading the reviews on Amazon, I decided to take a chance and go for the bigger 46\". I got mine for around $380.After unpacking, I read the instructions which cover everything, but you can tell is from a lower brand manufacturer. There's also a decent and easy to understand start-up guide.I like that there are multiple inputs for this TV. That's something often overlooked by most people but is a big let down when you get it home and can't plug in all your goodies. This one has 3 HDMI inputs, component inputs as well as RCA inputs and others.I agree with other reviewers that the base for this TV is a little on the weak/wobbly side. In my case this won't be an issue because its in a corner where kids wont be running around. If yours will be in an open area where it could be bumped into, this could pose a problem. A wall mount would be a good way to remedy this.The sound, as others have mentioned, is not home theater quality by any means, but as a bedroom TV it's adequate. I might upgrade in the future with a small sound bar or surround speakers.The picture is fantastic and couldn't be more pleased. I'm running my High Def cable box and PS3  both through HDMI's and the picture is amazing!I hope to re-review this TV in 8-10 months to give my long term assessment, but upon initial impression, I am pleased.I bought this TV for a few reasons...The first was the overall strong reviews on Amazon, the second was the great price. I read the negative reviews and saw that those who had problems were met with not so great customer service from Seiki, however, if you read the comments to those bad reviews someone from Seiki has included a direct email address to help remedy any issues...so it seems to me they are trying. I personally hope I never have to go down that road in the future, but we'll see.All in all I give this TV a solid four stars and for the price I got it at, that bumps it up to five!", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best TV we've got!", "Author": "Cr8zy for Wickless \"LCattell.Scentsy.us\"", "ReviewID": "R2B709QQ3LMKEQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this one Black Friday after we waited in line several hours for several TV's in the store.

We got the set for $379.00 so with taxes it came out to be $410.00 . This is only our 2nd day with the set and it had a very easy setup. The channel reception is fantastic. I believe this set looks better than our Sony every looked. It is much more crisp.  I attribute most of it to be LED vs LCD for the SONY. It picks up the over the air channels much better than the SONY ever did.  For the money this TV is well worth it. We watched some movies on the DVD with it and it worked fine with it.

Yay, cable remote works!One thing that took getting used to, the tv takes a while to power on. When you hit the power button, it stays black for a moment, then lights up blue, then flashes the Seiki logo for a couple of seconds before fully turning on.

McCravy", "ReviewID": "R1QX1IX2KUYT73", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the 46 inch Seiki LED from a chain store for $397 and what a good deal it turned out to be. Big box stores do not spend much time tweaking the picture of their \"loss leaders\" so I wasn't discouraged by the washed out picture of the display model or the salesman efforts to steer me to a higher priced LED. Once I got the Seiki home and gave it a good signal from the TW high def box and made a few easy meezy adjustments I had a stellar picture that popped with vibrant color.The menu is so easy to use that anyone can tweak the picture settings in a matter of seconds. Paying big bucks for picture calibration is bull manure and buying the extended warranty takes the Seiki out of the bargain basement category. My relative who works in the industry says, \"if panels fail it's generally out of the box or within the first year and your factory warranty covers that\".As others have noted, while the picture is excellent the sound is just passable. The small speakers located on the rear of the enclosure are no doubt the reason for the this. I solved this problem by connecting some spare PC speakers ( Logitech Z-2300 ) which have very good sound and include a small subwoofer.I have the Seiki in a bedroom and it's the perfect size for my medium sized room.

Birrueta \"Ever Bothersome\"", "ReviewID": "R3SSA4OH7WZ1P", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My opinion, simple. This tv is very inexpensive, so I considered it. It is a 1080p 60hz tv with plenty of inputs (i.e., 3 HDMI; 1VGA; 1USB; 1 Component/Composite combo, more on this later; 1COAX; and 1RCA output, the red and white cables for sound).As far as picture goes, this tv looks great. That darks look nice and black, and the brights don't overlap.My problem lies upon to aspects of this tv, and, of course, this may bother any possible future buyers. On the description for the product it says that the product as 1 Component, and 1 Composite inputs respectably. However, this tv has a combo of the two, meaning that it has the yellow input for composite, but if you want to use the red and white for sound you have to unplug that for the Component, meaning you can only use one at a time. They two inputs were falsely advertised as being two individual inputs, which inconvenienced me.The other problem I had with this product is the sound. I have a set of M Audio 40 speakers (it'll matter in a second). The speakers on a tv can never be expected to sound vull and bassy or anything, but they are expected not to crackle as if they're turned up all the way when they're not even half way the max. These speakers sounded horrible; everything crackled, at any volume level. Now, remember those speakers I mentioned? Lol. They matter now. I figured that it shouldn't matter if the tv doesn't sound too good since I won't be using it's default speaker since I have my external ones. So, I plugged in the M Audio speakers and they crackled as well, which I worried could damage them. Just to make sure it wasn't my speakers and not the tv \u2013'cause then I gotta return it\u2013 I plugged my external speakers into my previous tv; they worked fine on that tv. I plugged them back into this Seiki tv and they sounded horrible again.I gave this product 2 stars because I don't like how it's been manufactured. Also, for anyone considering buying: Their website a \"Contact Us\" option. I tried contact them via email, no response; I have tried contacting them via phone, no possible way of talking to a person \u2013at least not for me. So, beware of that.Conclusion:This product will give you many inputs, more than many other TVs, and nice 1080p (1930x1080) visuals for a low price.However, the sound quality of the internal speakers, as well as the inputs for external speakers really lack in quality creating that sort of sizzling sound one hears when something is turned up too high regardless how low the volume is.And, if you are to have a problem with the product, the only real option is to return it on Amazon (given that you bought it off Amazon, of course).I would recommend this tv to someone who doesn't care too much for sound quality \u2013assuming it to be an older person who is not too tech savy\u2013 or possibly to someone with a Playstation 3 and an external speaker system that supports Digital Optical Audio because, then, it is possible to plug a such cable from the Playstation 3 directly to the speaker system and selecting that option on the Playstation3 system completely bypassing the tv regarding sound. In other words, the sound quality on this tv makes it unbearable for avid gamers or avid movie watchers.End note: Not just music sounds bad on this tv. While playing games, every sound sizzles. And, whether it be a game or movie, voices are the worst. imagine someone turning the volume high as possible whenever someone talk even though the volume is relatively low.One more thing: if you buy this tv, don't throw away the box 'cause it'll cost you, possibly, $100 to have one custom made at UPS.I hope, whether you buy or not, that this helps anyone considering this tv.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cheap TV and Defective - do not buy", "Author": "Jithu", "ReviewID": "RUMOHL7179GRX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this item in November 2012 and returning it in January 2013.There are white dots appearing on the TV and Seiki said it cannot be repaired.It could only be returned but I have to pay the return shippping (What the heck) and they will replace it with a refurbished TV.Will put more bucks to buy a branded one.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Bad", "Author": "Doug", "ReviewID": "R1T9J86IJAAW31", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great product for the price.

The design is attractive without looking too cheap or flashy, it has enough outlets to hook up to their cable box, PS3, and combo DVD/VCR, and it's simple enough to navigate.The one major con I've discovered is that it has no headphone outlet. For many people with regular home theater sound systems, this won't be a big issue, but if you want to listen to the TV late at night without waking people up or to plug in a set of computer speakers (like my parents were using for this TV), you'll need to make sure that either your speaker system has its own headphone out or buy an analog-to-headphone adapter. Of course, the sound from the built-in speakers is bad enough that you'll probably want a dedicated sound system, anyway.To sum up:Pros:- This is about the lowest price you're going to find on an HDTV this price- It won't have every single bell or whistle that a more expensive TV would have, but it has everything you really needCons:- Poor sound from built-in speakers- No headphone jackIn sum, if you don't have thousands of dollars to spend on the best HDTV, I'd highly recommend this one.

It's super slim, loud, everything is working perfect and I couldn't find a thing to complain about. Other reviews complain about the volume and dead pixels but my TV is fine. At first, yes, the sound does seem like the speakers are in a box but once adjusted it's no issue at all. The sound/appearances are all equivalent to a Samsung, LG, Vizi, and other top of the line televisions. Other than that the stand is hard plastic but it holds and looks nice, the remote is pretty standard nothing fancy but who really uses it? If you have cable there's no need for it. I'm constantly running my Play Station 3 on it and it's top of the line HD! I love the size of the screen for gaming, 46' inches (: The only other \"bad\" thing I could say, which is really NO big deal, is that when I try to start a game/Netflix the whole screen turns blue for a couple seconds (like it's changing inputs) but it goes away so really quick and it doesn't ever happen after that. Tv shows, games, and Netflix run smooth without interruptions. GREAT TV FOR IT'S PRICE.UPDATE: It is now August 9/20/2013 and I've had my Seiki TV for near a year! It's still running like a charm! I couldn't be more happy because I constantly run gaming systems on it, I have mounted it, watch Netflix, and mess with it. Months ago I did get rid of the annoying blue screen (from changing inputs) by changing a few settings with the \"set-up wizard.\" The blue screen only bugged me because I have an issue with those on my computers but in this case nothing was wrong. I was right it only does that when changing from HDMI 1 etc. etc. but I got the color to black as it seems more suitable. Any who, I haven't had to change any bulbs yet either and I RUN that TV for hours/days straight! I'm so happy with my purchase because of that and I know what a drag it is to change a bulb.. it's costly and pretty hard to do if you don't know what you are doing. Compared to a higher brand name TV those damned things would need a new bulb only after a month or two with HALF of the use I put on my TV! The volume is also still fantastic on my tv, no issues whatsoever. I even figured out why the audio sounds weird in the first place.. it's because the speakers are located on the BACK of the tv on lifted horizontal sides so you don't smash the speakers against a wall. If you mount the tv or even put it on a piece of furniture (dresser/stand/etc.) it may or may not sound weird for a week or two but I can assure you it will sound perfect soon enough. I know this because I constantly switch from my room (Seiki tv) to the living room now (Samsung tv) and they both sound very much a like with perfect quality.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Seiki 46-inch LED HDTV", "Author": "ross hettenbach", "ReviewID": "R1C1UR1Y0EU591", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very prompt delivery.

It took approximately 4 minutes to hook the brackets to the back of the TV with the 4 screws that were provided with the TV and were pre-installed in the holes. Installation was quite easy and straight forward.  Be sure you remove the base for the stand in the right location if you want a snug fit to the wall.  There appears to be 2 ways to do this and while it was quite simple I can see someone removing the bottom portion of the stand insert vs. removing the entire insert from the back of the TV itself.The jacks are positioned to the rear so there will be some 'swiveling' or removing this TV from the wall for connecting extra device cables.  Use a mount that allows for this.  The TV is very light and manuvering it for this should not be a problem.Set up was approximately another 2 minutes (+channel search time).  The set up was pre-programmed and led me through step by step once the TV was turned on.Sound was as many have described already.  Ok but not great.

I've had this TV for a little over a week now. It's really light weight and fairly easy to set up. Did so myself. I would like to give one word of caution though. There is \"1\" screw included in the bag of other screws that is shorter than the rest. Take note to screw that one into cuff between the base and the TV. I half-mindedly proceeded to screw one of the longer screws into it thus breaking the threaded screw guide. Even with that said the stand still works fine. No shaking or risk of falling over. The more important screws all lined up and went in with ease. Just take your time assembling the TV to minimize any unexpected breaks or mistakes.As far as image and sound quality. I have my Digital HD box hooked up to it and all of the shows I've viewed (consisting of sports and the news) come through quite clear. I haven't noticed any grain as I tend to do with TVs located in-store. If there is grain I'm over-looking it, but that's one area I've been quite critical on. Audio comes through in an acceptable manner. No distortion and I have no trouble hearing the TV on its lowest settings. Haven't cranked it all the way up seeing as there is no need for me to do so. So no word on higher level distortion. If the sound quality is less than suffice for you, at this price you can splurge a little more and invest in a nice home audio system.So far I've mainly used this TV to play Black Ops 2. It definitely delivers the resolution I need to stay on top of my game and competitors. I've also used the TV to watch the movie Brave (great movie by the way). There was one scene in the movie where the picture came through a little dark, but I'm not sure if that was an intended result of the movie itself or a \"black level\" issue. Either way it wasn't bad and we were still able to enjoy the movie.If I was in the process of buying a TV again and the same factors were still present I'd make the same choice.

The first thing I noticed was how much brighter the picture was and how incredibly good the contrast ratio's were... WOW!!, I actually had to go into the menu and \"soften\" the picture, (thought later in the morning with the glare coming in from the window, I put it back to \"Normal\").  I was actually VERY surprised by this because my Plasma advertised better contrast ratios's than this unit, yet my old plasma unit looks \"washed out\" compared to the Seiki.  I was concerned that the reflective black screen would end up reflecting the window facing the TV, but it actually wasn't as bad as it was on the Plasma, so that was a relief.I'll sometimes turn off the Denon sound system at night when everyone is sleeping, since the Subwoofer rumbles even at low volumes, and the sound system on the TV sounds fairly clean and crisp, though nothing of course compared to my Denon AV, and I've only used it to listen at low volumes so this isn't really an accurate assesment of the unit's sound capabilities.  Sometimes when watching fast action on the screen, I do see the difference between this 60Hz system and my plasma's 600Hz, I always told myself that If I move to an LCD or LED I'd get at least a 120Hz, but at less than $400.00 I just couldn't pass this unit up.I have a Google TV box and PS3 hooked up to the system, though both first pass through the Denon and Web Browsing is FANTASTIC on the Google TV and games are pretty good on the PS3", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very nice TV", "Author": "R.

The picture quality, brightness, and color again, are not perfect, but great for the price. Sound quality - not great, but that seems to be a common theme among all HDTVs. One thing that was EXTREMELY important to me was avoiding what has become known as the \"Soap Opera Effect\" or motion smoothing. That totally drives me crazy, but appears to be an issue only on LEDs with 120hz or great refresh rates. Because of that, I am really glad that this is only 60hz. Movies still look like film and not a home movie!Overall, I'm super happy. If you are extra critical of some of the technological details, by all means spend more money and go with a big name brand.

I knew what I wanted, namely a 40+ inch, LED, 1080i TV.  I was looking at several higher end name brands but the price range just wasn't what I wanted.  When I came across this Seiki, I did some research and saw that almost all of the reviews for this product on multiple sites (not just Amazon) were very positive.  My brother, who sold TV's retail for a while, said he had really good luck with off brands in the past and said with the price, I should take the chance.Well, I purchased it on Black Friday, when it was marked down to $399.00.  On Cyber Monday, Amazon discounted it to $349.00.  I called and they immediately refunded the difference in those prices, which is typical for Amazon, great customer service.  Loved it.The TV arrived two days later and was a quick and painless install.  I have ATT UVerse and had to change some settings on the ATT receiver box (telling it to send a 1080i video signal, and a full surround audio signal), but we were up and running in 20 minutes.  The picture is fantastic.  The TV was easy to lift and maneuver as well.The only real negatives are the 60Hz refresh rate and the volume.I had hoped to find 120Hz but doesn't seem like Seiki does that with this size, but the price was too good to pass up.  I've watched several football games in HD (I'll never be able to watch them on my standard TV again) and didn't notice any issues with that.  The refresh rate only seems to affect fast action sequences.  You get a bit of tiling.  I first noticed it watching the finale of \"The Walking Dead\" in a fight scene.  But it wasn't distracting and didn't create a problem for me.The volume on this TV just isn't that loud, but other reviews indicated this so I knew what to expect.  Plus, I'm running the audio through a Pioneer DTS 7.1 receiver anyway (video and audio) so I don't use the TV speakers for anything anyway.  Keep that in mind though if you plan to use this TV's speakers as your primary audio.  They are small, soft, and tinny.Overall, this is a good TV at a phenomenal price.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Most bang for your buck!", "Author": "antman04", "ReviewID": "RZAHD0O8U9K9K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "By far the most bang for your buck.

I did the same in this case, I did not see this particular model in stores, I probably would have bought it right there, but I saw a smaller Seiki.I compared the luminosity of the Seiki with others like LG, (which I deem good) I found shade, or shadows effects on the screen of those, while on this one luminosity shows even all around the screen. Only when there is not input is there uneven luminosity to be seen.Picture in high def is very bright and vibrant, it has lots of inputs, and it is good at energy saving. The 46\" size really feel as if it was around 55\" due to the brightness of the screen.I really recommend this tv, specially for that price.The delivery was not as timely as I expected, one day after schedule, and the lack of Federal Express to provide a limited timeframe of hours for delivery.

I decided I would rather save some money and don't like the bells and whistles the name brand TVs are forcing me to pay for when I would rather hook up a device like an XBOX 360 or an Apple TV to do my \"Smart TV\" functions.Unfortunately, this Seiki TV had horizontal lines starting about half way down the screen until about the bottom 1/3 of the screen making the television virtually unwatchable.  I have attached a picture in the customer images section to show my problem.  Luckily, Amazon is great and is sending me a replacement with 2 day shipping.I'm still hopeful I just got a defective unit and will update my review if the new Seiki I receive doesn't have any screen issues.  Just be careful when you see a great price with an unknown brand because you might have to go threw a few duds because of quality control concerns.UPDATED:I received my second Seiki TV and am very pleased.  I would have likely rated this 5 stars if I received this TV the first time but have to knock it down a star for the chance you get a dud.  There is noticeable light bleeding on the top corners of the TV but at this price a perfect display cannot be expected.
