{"Reviews": [{"Title": "850A compared to 900A and in depth 850A review", "Author": "John Connor", "ReviewID": "R21187MHLL03MN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I knew I wanted either the 65\" XBR65X900A or the XBR65X850A.  I spent a lot of research on the AVSForums and at my local Sony store where I got to play with them side by side.  With the fact that you get the Sony 4k player free with the 900, which you can sell for $500, the cost of the 2 is essentially the same.  I eventually bought the 850, and here is why and my review:Comparison 900 to 850:I think the 850 looks much better.  The ears (speakers) on the 900 just look dumb to me, and most early high end buyers either have a good sound bar or have a home theatre system (which I do).  So I knew I would never use the speakers.  Yes the 900 has a wow factor because it looks different with that slab of Gorilla glass, while the 850 looks more traditional, but the 850 still looks very professional and high end.But mostly the 900 is just WAY to reflective.  In the store, with the lights behind, the 900 was almost unwatchable.  The 850 is not a matte screen, it is still somewhat reflective, but it is nothing like the 900.  Basically with them side by side I could see the same reflections in both, but with the 900 the reflections were sharp and clear, but with the 850 they were muted.  So when watching TV I could not help but noticing the reflections in the 900, while the 850 were muted enough so I did not notice them unless I consciously looked for them.  Now my home, even during the day with lights on, is not as bright as the store, but with the 850 here I am very glad I got it and not the 900.  The 850 is still more reflective then my old Sony 60\" SXRD, but I do not notice them.  I think the 850 is the perfect balance, as the more reflective the deeper the colors.  So unless you only plan to only watch movies in a dedicated dark room I could not imagine the 900 working out.Other than that they both looked the same to me.  If anything I like the 850's overall picture a little better to me, even though technically the 900 is supposed to be the `better' TV.  So when Amazon offered their $400 is Amazon credit for the 850, I bought it.  (The saleslady at the Sony store even admitted that the employees all like the 850 better than the 900)850 review:I have the following inputs driving my 850.  FiOS cable (1080i), PS3, PS4, Xbox One (all 1080p) and my PC which can do native 4096x2160p (24 Hz) and 3840x2160p (30 Hz).  Note that the 4k Sony's (850 and 900) will be upgraded to full 60 Hz for the 3840 (and 48 Hz for 4096) by the end of this year, meeting HDMI 2.0 specs. (edit: this has already taken place)I did some basic calibrations with my old Avia DVD.  The Sony is not set up as bad stock as some TV's, but still needed some tuning.  TV looks great.  HD content (which is either 720p or 1080i, depending on the station) looks very sharp up converted to 4k.  I was worried because the better your picture the worse bad content looks, but even the SD content looks better than my old TV.  Now I don't think SD content is going to look any better than a high end 1080p TV, but it is good.DVD's look fine, and Blu-Ray's look AMAZING.  I think the up conversion to 4k with the Blu-Ray's does make a small difference.  Or maybe it's just all the other high end quality parts of this TV, but movie night just bumped up a notch in quality from my old TV.The biggest difference to me though is the PC/Game quality.  For the PC, this is an amazing monitor, either in 2k or 4k.  My 1080p games (either the PC or the various game machines) look amazing and I notice no blurring or lag issues (Forza 5 looks fantastic).4k: So what about 4k?  My only 4k content are demos played through VLC on the PC.  Yes, they do look amazing when you are up close (3 feet away).  The funny thing is 1080p material looks just as good.  So I did some screenshots and you could barely tell the difference.  I think the 4k up scaling of 1080 material is just so good that you can barely tell the difference.  So I did some screen captures of the same 1080p material on my computer monitor (1920x1080) and indeed I could tell a difference.  So while the native 4k material is thin now, the up scaling of 1080 material does help a little.  Nothing huge mind you, but it is something and gives reason for getting this TV even if you have no 4k material now.Streaming and Apps:  This TV streams almost everything from my PC (including MKV files).  The audio is passed through to my receiver perfectly with the ARC passthru in 5.1.  Oddly it does not stream the 4k mp4 files...  It also does not stream flac audio files, which all my music is in, but I have given up on that even though flac is by far the best, and lossless, audio codec there is and is used all over the place.  There are also a TON of apps.  Most are useless, but the big ones like NetFlix and Amazon work fine.3D: I didn't get to compare the 900's 3D, but the active sync 3D of the 850 is amazing.  Now I really don't care much about 3D and will only watch it occasionally, but it does look amazing.  Both interlaced 3D Blu-Ray's and side-by-side downloads streamed through the PC.  I see no flickering and the 3D effect is really good.  Even the 2D->3D looks quite good on some things.  It does give me a little headache after a while, but 3D is a very individual thing.This being my first LED TV I was worried about motion, and this is \"only\" 120Hz.  I have watched football, movies etc, played games, and there is nothing to worry about.  Yes, if you get the exact right shot, like a slow pan across an indoor studio, you can notice some jitter (with the MotionFlow off) or a smooth pan with hiccups (with the MotionFlow on), but in reality you never notice it.  This is an issue with ANY LCD/LED TV, and the Sony is fine.  (Most recommend either turning off MotionFlow or setting to Cinema mode, anything else looks too fake)Now this TV is not perfect.  The circular stand really looks nice, but sticks out in front of the TV a bit (no issue if you mount it obviously).  My biggest complaint however is the manual.  Not only do you not get it (it's available online only), but even though it's 250 pages it goes into no detail.  For instance, on the Motionflow there are something like 7 different setting, but nowhere does the manual tell you exactly what those settings mean, and what they do different from each other!  There are a lot of high end picture settings you can change on this TV, but nothing in the manual on specifics of what they do.  Come on Sony!  The speakers are better than a cheap TV and can be used in a pinch, but no one spending $4K on a TV will be using these speakers.  So you will need a decent sound bar and subwoofer at the minimum.  (where as with the 900 the speakers are probably just good enough to stand on their own with a good subwoofer)Overall I am thrilled with the TV.  Is the 4k worth the extra over Sony's high end 1080p TV?  Probably not right now, but then again is a 60k car really worth it over a 30k car?  I'm happy.  With the HDMI 2.0 firmware upgradeable this TV will be future proof for a very long time.  And in 2 years 4k media players will be available for $200 with hundreds of movies (as opposed to $700 with a dozen movies now)  For me, my old TV was shot and I wasn't going to get a 1080p only to have to get a 4k one in 3 years.  This TV should last for 10 years, and if it does that it will be well worth the money.Update: I purchased Assassins Creed IV for the PC.  WOW, do you notice the difference running it at 3840x2160 vs 1920x1080.  I mean my friends can even tell from sitting on the couch when I switch back and forth how much sharper the 4k is.  Unfortunately for me my somewhat new PC is not powerful enough to really handle 4k, to actually play the game at 30fps I have to lower so many settings...  But in 2 years or so (I am not about to spend another $1500 to get the top of the line PC parts now) when I have a new processor and video card PC games should be amazing!Update #2: TV is still doing fine in April now.  One thing is I do occasionally notice a little motion jitter when watching cable TV.  Like when I watch a football game it will be all smooth, then just occasionally it will jitter for a split second, not enough to bother me but you do notice.  I never had that with my old SXRD TV, and I know all LCD/LED TV's have this issue.  As I have no other big TV to compare to (my little 20\" in the kitchen doesn't do this, but it's only 20\") I don't know if this TV is any better or worse then others.  Oddly I never have this happen with games...Also, the other 4k thing is how much better my PC looks on it in full 4k.  Especially high resolution photos, there is a huge difference when you have a photo from a 15-20 megapixel camera and you display it in 1080 vs 4k.  Night vs day!", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unbelievable TV, picture blows you away and Sony does it again!!", "Author": "Matthew J. Liptak \"lip89\"", "ReviewID": "RJF77O1VZLU1E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received this TV today and first off delivery was somewhat smooth with one or two bumps but nothing big. This TV is everything you hear about minus the silly speakers along the side bar edges. The 4K is something to see and with this set buying the Media Player along with it is essential since you won't have to bring a technician to upgrade your TV like the XBR65X900A. This set is already up to date and has the latest upgrades. Within 10 minutes I was up and running and turning this on it literally blew me away. The 4K and even the HD are beautiful with no sign of pixels and the 65\" shows this off even more than I would imagine the 55\". What I noticed is that Sony did a very good job of streamlining their applications and internet content and now has tons more similar to a Roku box. Also the menus and preferences are picture icons and are larger. They also did away with the flat stand and went to a chrome heavy duty ring which is heavier but they did do away with a feature I enjoyed which was the tilt screen and now it is totally vertical which I can live with.The 4K content on the media player is quite impressive with all sorts of demos of how cool this set looks and they also loaded up 10 movies in 4K of all new titles and TV shows to show off how glamorous 4K looks. For this price, the picture needs to look pristine and it does and was worth every penny. I am very satisfied with this purchase. One thing, be careful ordering from Amazon when it comes to Ceva shipping, They came through in the end but the tracking was sub par and never clued me in to where this item was the entire time to delivery window. For those other reviews saying this is not worth it and not ready for prime time, just wait, Sony is not a dumb company,...remember they were the first to jump on board with Blu Ray loading it into the new PS3s. 4K is here to stay and you won't be sorry. I have owned 4 Sony TVs and not one has done me wrong. They also throw in 1 year of Hulu Plus and Netflix streaming so you can't go wrong there.UPDATE 10/5: Watching this for a few days now it is truly impressive however it does require professional calibration from an expert (not Geek Squad). I hired one of the top experts in the Northeast to come out this week and calibrate this TV the right way. Yes it is an extra cost, but for this high end a TV, why not get the best. Without the right calibration, the black levels and dimming and color is off on the factory settings and trying to adjust yourself is pointless. Regular cable even in HD does not look great on this TV the way it comes shipped. Lots of washed out faces and blossoming colors. Also, not crazy about the stand. Not sure why Sony went to this giant silver stand, yet it is sturdy but looks strange to have this large raised ring at the bottom of this TV, plus prevents a sound bar from being used against the TV and putting a bar on top blocks the screen so I had to pull my Sonos bar way in front of the ring. The chrome ring looks a bit cheesy.As for the 4K the newer movies much like Blu Ray are impressive like Total Recall and Amazing Spiderman. I tried watching a clip of Glory and although it was crystal, it was still not as striking as the newer movies. Once the calibration happens I am sure I will be more impressed.Regular Blu Ray and 3D are great on this set. I tried out Tron Legacy in 3D and even with active 3D, it was pretty cool. Watched Star Trek III in blu ray and it was very impressive even for an older movie like that. Again, once the calibration happens, I am quite sure I will be blown away. One thing I will make clear, this set is very nice because the frame around the set is almost a slate/silver color and is very thin, unlike the 900A with the side speakers which to me looked horrible, this set is full 65\" edge to edge and the screen is very large. Moving up from a 55\" to this set it was quite a noticeable difference, but I have to say between this set and the Samsung's, I will go with Sony every time. They just know how to make TVs and don't have their hand in the mobile market distracting them from good quality video. I am sure by years end there will be tons more 4K content out there. For now, it seems they have just enough to wet the palate of the consumer and keep them wanting more. One thing that really impressed me about 4K is the sound is unreal. It blows Blu Ray sound away. So far so good on this set.UPDATE 10/6: One thing I noticed walking into a Magnolia section of a Best buy is that all of their 4Ks are connected to high end Power Conditioners/Surge Suppressors. I rethought my home theater set up and began rethinking the Monster $100 power strip I had this magnificent piece of technology connected to and ended up buying a Panamax M5300-PM. For $576 what this does is not only protect the entire system from power surges, it evens the power out and actually projects a better picture and sound. I then viewed 4K again after connecting and it was even more impressive than before and the sound was unreal. I highly recommend adding one of these to your set up for peace of mind etc. Why not since you just dropped 5K on a TV, $500 is nothing. Also added a new Logitech Harmony Touch Ultimate remote to upgrade mine from the 900. This along with my entire Sonus surround system with playbar, sub and two Play 3s, I believe now this set up is complete.UPDATE 10/10: I had the Set calibrated today by a 20+ year Professional Calibration technician with some high speed calibration equipment. Adjusted Grey Scale, black levels, color etc. What a difference. Sony was not off with factory settings he mentioned, however he adjusted to Custom Settings and adjusted all sorts of levels including Gamma and it is unbelievable. Everything is in natural tone like it should be and now this set is even more magnificent. This now looks like it should and the 4K really pops! Awesome!UPDATE 10/12: This will be my last update since having this TV over 1 week I have provided as much info as I could. To conclude, the professional calibration needed to be tweaked. As much as the calibration wants to show \"natural tones\" and \"what the directors see\" when they film something, it was too dark and dim to continue watching. According to the calibrator, the extra settings Sony puts on TVs are to keep up with the competition such as motion control etc, however I disagree and it is all personal preference. My preference is for this TV to be set to brighter more elaborate tones so it pops which it now does since I adjusted accordingly. I could not get used to the dark almost black images so I had to go back a bit to what I liked. Not sure I would recommend professional calibration since most TVs today do a pretty good job of letting the consumer adjust. I did however purchase a calibration DVD to have in case I wanted to make further adjustments. In all, this is an amazing TV and I am very happy with this purchase.UPDATE 4/9/14: DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL SONY TV. I just found out that this model does not include an codec feature needed to stream future 4K content like Netflix and Sony may roll out something this summer but until then this is a plain old 65\" paper weight and is not up to speed with all newer 4K TVs being released. So I basically just wasted all this money on something that will have to receive a serious hardware upgrade. I am blown away at how crazy this is and how Sony can just leave its loyal customers in a lurch having just released this TV in October 13.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "The X850 XBR 4K is Superior in Quality and Performance", "Author": "Brian A. Johnson", "ReviewID": "R2YS64UXO88FYN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Sony 55-inch XBR55X850A is the most outstanding and user friendly television I've ever owned. I've owned the X850 for a month, and I enjoy it so much I thought I would write a review to help prospective buyers before they lay down their precious money on a 4K model. I consider the X850 to be top quality, and to be superior to anything on the market today. This is the fourth Sony XBR television I've owned. I always consider other brands, but I always gravitate back to Sony because of the picture clarity. With the 4K feature, it was a purchase that had to be made.  For the skeptical buyer, here are a few things to consider (in a concise review).First, the X850 (like the X900) is an edge lit LED television, which provides no color or brightness variation on its large LCD screen. The picture is OUTSTANDING. Remember, currently all home televisions are LCD with LED lighting. The LED edge lighting system Sony devised is identical to backlit models. The balance is perfect in the middle and to the edges/corners of the screen. Thus, the edge lighting makes this a thinner television when compared to backlit models. It weighs less too.Second, the 4K picture resolution is the most dazzling and mind blowing picture I've ever seen. Four times better than the 1082p picture, the 4K picture is stunning. However, the 1080p picture is also beautiful and rich. 4K upscaling from a blu-ray player (3D 4K Blu-ray player around $250 @ Amazon) with that capability plays well on this television. The market is slowly supporting more 4K blu-ray movies, so the full potential of this model can be utilized now.  Also, 4K is the future, even with 8K systems being explored and broadcast still at 720p. The X850 XBR is an outstanding buy for the price.Third, the outputs on the rear of the television are more than sufficient. Even with the complaints by some, consider that any television is not the center of your HDMI hub. That honor goes to your receiver. The X850 can integrate into any standard setup using its HDMI ports and other inputs/outputs.Fourth, the sound is great. It won't blow your ears off (leave that to your surround system), but it's more than adequate. I do recommend not putting this model television in an enclosed area or on a surface that has a poor acoustic reflective capability. The speakers are down firing, so I recommend a strong reflective surface such as tempered glass. I have a glass top stand, which sends the sound throughout my family room. It compares well with my front firing speakers from my last XBR.Fifth, the 3D and network capabilities are a great feature. Remember, the XBR 850 has an active 3D system that uses powered 3D glasses. The XBR900 has a passive system that uses regular 3D glasses, but I think the picture is slightly brighter on the X850 model in 3D mode. Of course, I'm more of a 2D fan than 3D. Networking this model is easy. Even though some other owners have voiced their frustration with networking this model, it's easy if you slow down and follow each step to link it to your home net system. Moreover, the television is extremely user friendly with many optional software upgrading capabilities (if you're into that sort of techno thing - otherwise, leave it alone and it will work just fine).  The X850 has an internal user manual too.Finally, consider the purchase. I didn't know whether to buy a television through Amazon or my local retailer (Best Buy). I decided to go with Amazon. The delivery was awesome. I had full intentions to inspect the X850 out of the box upon delivery, which Amazon recommends; however, the box didn't even have a dent in it. It was flawless to say the least, and the unpacking and setup was super easy. However, to avoid difficulties two people are needed to attach the stand. Amazon truly believes in customer satisfaction, because I would have sent this television back in a heartbeat if the box was damaged.All in all, the X850 was an excellent buy. I am stunned by all the problems that some buyers have encountered. Sony has earned my trust, but I do understand that technology isn't perfect. This television doesn't include every feature that your imagination can produce. However, the X850 is a fantastic 4K product and worth every nickle at the present time and Amazon price. That sums up my purchase.", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sony Delivers!", "Author": "Tmac7balla", "ReviewID": "RNG0GUFWLP6UG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the 65\" for a really good deal at Best Buy and this product is absolutely amazing. The price is a little high but that is the price you pay for early adoption. I have had this tv for about a month now. I wanted to be sure that I had enough use with the product before reviewing it.SET-UPInitial set up of the product is easy. The TV is heavy so make sure you have another person helping you especially if you plan to wall mount this beast. When you first turn it on it will have you set up your internet connection and then it will ask to update your tv software. All pretty easy. You can choose either wi-fi or ethernet for the internet connection.PICTURE QUALITYWhen watching 4k the picture is nothing short of breathe taking. The colors are rich and picture has plenty of depth. Your eyes are in complete shock when watching true 4k content. When watching regular HD content the upscaling is also really good. You can change how much the tv upscales in the picture setting where it says \"resolution\" Messing with a few setting you can really make pictures pop off the screen. Note that adding to much resolution can make the image not as clear. Image blur is non noticeable on the tv. There are plenty of settings to choose from to control the motion blur. Watching sports is seamless. Also with 2d to 3d converting, with a push of a button you can make the sports 3d if you decide you want to watch the Houston Rockets destroy the Lakers in 3D.GAMING PICTURE QUALITYGaming on this TV is like nothing I have ever seen. I cannot speak for current gen systems(360/ps3) but for PC gaming this tv is perfect. There is a gaming mode setting on the tv so you will see no lag what so ever. Also if your pc does not have the specs to game at 4k you can play at regular 1080p go into the TV picture settings. turn up the resolution and it is almost as good as playing at native 4k resolution! I have 2 GTX 780's running in SLI and have done comparison testing of the 1080p upscaled vs playing native at 4k on cyrsis 3 on ultra settings. Although playing natively at 4k will leave your jaw dropped playing at 1080P upscaled to 4k is still leagues above playing 1080p on a regular tv or monitor.INTERNET APPSMy top app to use on this tv is the youtube app. You can link your smart phone or tablet with your youtube account and tv device with a paring code. Download the youtube app on your phone or tablet. Once that is done you can search for videos on your smart device and when you choose a video to watch, the app on your smart device will give you an option on which device to play the video. If you choose your TV, the sony tv will AUTOMATICALLY switch to the youtube app and start playing your video. No need to manually switch to the youtube app. When a video is playing you can browse for other videos on the youtube app on your smart device and add videos to your queue for continuous and smooth video playback. There is 4k content on youtube as well to watch. When playing a video as how I explained above you can still use your smart device, you are not forced to stay on the youtube app on your phone or tablet for the video payback on the tv will continue. There is also an app for IOS and Android device called \"TV Sideview\" the app will allow you to use your phone or tablet as a remote for your tv. This app WILL allow you to remotely turn the TV on or off with your phone or tablet. Netflix playback on this tv is smooth and quick loading whether you're using ethernet or wifi. This device supports Netflix new super HD future which really makes the netlix playback even that much better. Netflix has also been talking about adding 4k to their selection in the near future. This TV has countless other apps to use make sure to explore them and decide which ones are good for you.CON'sOther than the price nothing.SUMMARYThis TV is above and beyond what we were expecting. Sony made a promise and delivered with outstanding results. We decided to go with the sony over the samsung model because of the more natural look of the picture quality. The samsung has a brighter and more vibrant picture quality. The two TV's are so neck and neck I recommend going with which ever one has the picture quality you prefer. Sony for the more natural deep color look and Samsung for a brighter and vibrant.This product has... Useful Internet-enabled features, Easy to set up, Right number of connections, Easy to use remote control, stunning picture quality, 2d to 3d converting, 4k upscaling, wi-fi, arc functionAbout me...

Florida", "ReviewID": "R1KLZIERLHJIY3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have always purchased Sony televisions for over 25 years..I even had the very first XBR model back when...so it was no surprise that this Sony XBR 65 inch 4K model is probably the best on the market. Remember it is Sony who introduced 4K in movie theaters so stick with a Sony if you are planning on the 4K plunge. Right out of the box without any tweaks the picture is amazing. This Triluminos display that the television has brings out the best colors I have ever seen. The 4K upscale from regular HD cable programming is litterally jaw dropping. Most scenes(programming) look so crisp and clear and so colorful that it looks almost 3D like.(and I am not using the 2D to 3D conversion)..Remember it also depends on the channel you are watching,the transmission of the signal. When the transmission is not so good there's nothing much that can be done(gargbage in-garbage out),but when the signal is perfect you will be amazed at the clarity and color. And its not just me--I recently had a few guests over and their reactions were \"It's beautiful\"..\"I just can't believe the picture\"...\"It's stunning\" was a few of their actual reviews.I have not experemented with actual 4K content or Mastered in 4K Blu Ray content but if regular HD cable programming is this good..I cant wait to see actual 4K content.(You Tube does have some 4K content you can experiment with and I can only say \"wait till you see it to believe it\")The 3D is also simply amazing (yes it is Active ) with adjustments to increase 3D depth,3D Brightness by increasing the 3D glasses brightness(Sony has now solved the argument that Active 3D is dimmer than Passive 3d) and adjustments to increase the 3D expierence itself..Wait till you see 3D upscaled to 4K!..and so many Apps with Sony Entertainment Network (Netflix and Hulu Plus FREE for 1 year,Amazon,Crackle just to name a few ) it may take me weeks to go thru all of them ....this television will keep me busy for quite a while...I know the price is high at approx $5K but this is the TV that you may have for the next 10+ years,so its a great investment. I have to go now and continue watching the best television I have ever seen....", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "4K stars", "Author": "BeyondHD", "ReviewID": "R2YWJAECSD1YOL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A few days ago my Samsung 55 inch HDTV simply stop working, the lower led's were damage and the tv just turn off by itself. Well, I have no other option to buy a new TV set. After some research between the few models that are right now on the market and watching a couple of store units in full 4K glory I decided to get the XBR55X850. By the way, I got  this TV in a Sony promotion that include a Sony Xperia Z Tablet and (4) mastered 4K BD movies. Anyway I went home and started hooking my TV with the HT, Oppo and PS4, then I did some picture calibration that took me almost 2 hours. One more hint, if you're gonna use this set with a Oppo player I really suggest to set the output mode on the Oppo to \"source direct\" that will feed the signal directly to the tv and let the 55X850 handle the upscaling process. To my surprise, the Sony X850 it much better doing this process of upscaling.The results? Well, this is a great UHD TV but picture quality is a bit better than watching any normal 1080P so don't spect any UltraHD miracle to happen even with HD channels, some will look better than others. I'm sure results will be the same or similar on any other 4K TV set, keep in mind that this is Sony second generation 4K technology, eventually it will improve over the time. In my opinion the problems is the lack of 4k native content that the technology needs to show it's colors. Hey, is like having a Ferrari without the key to drive it, this is the price you pay for been an early adopter and I'm sure every owner of a 4K TV is hungry for new content.Back to this TV set,1080P BluRay movies will really benefit from the screen higher resolution, even the 4k mastered films will look much better but remember they are 1080P movies coming from a 4K mastered source, but is not 4K native. Remember those Super-Bit discs back in the DVD era, you get the idea. For those of you who like Sony Motionflow refresh rate I have to say this is the best tv set I have seen so far, eliminating the famous \"halo effect\" or any other artifact making the picture look smooth & slick as butter. Now, watching some 4K Native clips on YouTube by using the tv internal app was another experience, image was freaking sharp with excellent display of jaw dropping colors. Speaking of colors the Triluminos display does really makes the colors pop, is like a bag of Skittles that looks vivid and natural but not over saturated. Also the X850 is really good handling black levels not as good as a Plasma but almost as good as the famous XBR-HX950, just pop in a copy of The Dark Knight and go the scene where Batman is at the top of a skyscraper in Shanghai, you will love the deep blacks and high contrast. On the gaming side, all my PS4 games looked amazing and Forza 5 on the Xbox One is simply awesome. So far I have seen no lag on screen just make sure you select Game (Scene). The audio on this unit is very good but not great, it also has an equalizer and HDMI output level which will let you tweak the audio at your desire. The XBR850A also has HDMI 2.0 support, also the new firmware download is now available, now it supports 4K at 60hz/50hz. So far I have not any clouding or LED bleeding issue, I guess I'm lucky.

The 4K picture is beautiful but the 1080P is not so great.  I would rather watch a Plasma picture from a Panasonic then this tv for any broadcast tv.  The problem with this tv is \"off axis viewing\".  If you watch this tv sitting centered on the screen the picture is great but when you shift the viewing angle, either right or left or vertically (standing, sitting) or combination of the two the quality of the picture decreases dramatically.  Additionally, the \"out of the box\" picture is not good.  You must go into the advance settings, then white balance then decrease the R, G & B gains.  My settings are -22, -20, -22, -10, 0, -5 and on the main settings page the HUE is at R5 and every other setting is changed.  The out of the box picture was way too red, green and blue.  Watching the Ducks play football or Green Bay was painful.  Now the Sunday night football game picture is outstanding as long as I'm sitting in the perfect location, moving off axis and the picture quality goes way down.  If you are 20 degrees or more from a straight-on view the picture goes quality goes way down.  This TV needs several user savable picture adjustment settings that can be saved.  Once you change the settings you cannot save those settings and then create another set of settings (to watch a 4K picture)Cons--out of the box picture quality is unacceptable and off axis picture is unacceptable.Pro- sitting in the perfect spot creates an outstanding picture", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best 4K UHD and Upscaled HD experience with Sony!", "Author": "A D \"AD\"", "ReviewID": "R2GR7AIQAFP6QU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK! I am not a big review guy but this TV pushed me to write a few words. This TV is simply amazing! You are paying for the best picture quality in 4K TV out there, if you planning to purchase this particular model. Yes, I have looked at almost all of them. Samsung, Sharp, Seiki (WTF), LG etc. I work in film and animation industry and I have been doing effects work for over 16 years. I have worked on all kinds of professional monitors as well as projectors. This TV will require professional calibration if you want to push it to the edge to get the highest quality picture out of it. Sony ships the TV with above average calibration which is still pretty good. Upscaling from HD to 4K is awesome too. Netflix SuperHD on this TV is best looking so far. I have Dish network and thats looking pretty decent upscaled from HD (not SD). Not much 4K content out there, but was happy to get $450 media player with 10 free movies from Sony and a lot of free 4K short clips to noodle around with. If you are questioning yourself between Sony or Samsung, go with the quality, which can never be Samsung.", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Save your money - until later", "Author": "Niall O'Driscoll", "ReviewID": "RMV37P9DHUNH5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "No question about it, the picture available from this TV is stunning.  In fact, I'm inclined to believe that TVs will never get any better.  If higher resolution or better color were possible I don't think I could discern the difference.  Maybe someday TVs will holographically project photorealistic shows into the middle of the room and it will seem like actors are standing there talking to you, but I'm not holding my breath and am not sure I'd want it anyway.  So as good as this is, why not buy it?Well, at some point it will make sense to buy it, but that point is not now.  The reason is that there's really no content available to take advantage of the TV's capabilities.  Yes, if you buy the $700 cake-tin FMP-X1 player to go with it, you'll get 10 free movies of Sony's choosing and ~70 more to buy or rent, but that's a ridiculously small selection.  In two months I've watched three 4k movies.  Also, in the two months I've owned the TV its price has fallen by a thousand dollars.Netflix plans to roll out some 4k content in 2014 but currently the only source is Sony via the FMP-X1.  On a 30 megabit Internet connection it takes me four hours to download a movie, and I can't start watching it until its fully downloaded.  Movie rentals are $8, and purchases are $30.  Yes, you read that right.  You can buy a movie on Blu-ray from Amazon for $10 and have it delivered tomorrow, getting deleted scenes, director's commentary, multi-language support, etc. for $10.  Or you can start downloading it in the evening for $30 and start watching it tomorrow with none of those extras.  Alternatively you can watch it immediately in HD from Netflix as part of your $7/month subscription fee, or watch it on Amazon Instant Video for free with your Prime membership.Why a 4k movie costs $30 is beyond me.  A standard DVD (480p) of Ghostbusters at Amazon is $9.96.  The Blu-ray version (1080p) is $10.50.  I.e. 4x the resolution for 1.1x the price.  4k gives you 4x the Blu-ray resolution for 3x the price.  For movies shot in 4k the difference is visible, but for movies remastered in 4k (which is most of them) the difference is essentially undetectable.I believe that 4k is the future, but it's certainly not the present.  This TV will probably cost $1k by the time there's enough content and bandwidth available to make it worth owning.  That may be a year or two from now, but unless you've got nothing else to do with your money I'd wait until then before purchasing one.UPDATE: One more reason to wait: if you search the Web for \"Netflix UHD 4k Interview\" you'll discover that Netflix has developed 4k content, which is ready to go, but can only be viewed by TVs having a built-in h.265 decoder.  Sony plans to include the h.265 decoder in future models, along with HDMI 2.0, but this TV has neither.", "Date": "December 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Sony 4K picture without the side speakers", "Author": "Zach F.", "ReviewID": "R12B95DAQZYMAT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV at Best Buy about two weeks ago and so far I love it! I did not set out to buy 4K but after comparing this set to my original choice the Sony KDL-55W900A I decided the superior color gamut and design quality made this TVs higher cost a worth while trade off. This TV has about 8 million pixels and the W900A has about 2 million pixels that difference allows Triluminos to display richer color on this TV then what it can on its 1080p counterpart although it achieves this through up-converting the signal to  4K. This can cause graininess in the image especially on compressed signals like cable and low definition signals. The chrome metal stand on this TV is very nice compared the W900A's metallic plastic stand. Thankfully Sony didn't include the W900A's totally ugly square name plate on the bottom of the set and instead chose a much more attractive flush to bezel name plate for the X850A. The W900A does have less input lag, and offers a 240hz refresh rate to this sets 120hz so there are advantages to that set as well.I also compared this TV to its big brother the Sony XBR 55X900A and chose this set. It was really nice to be able to compare all three sets at Best Buy. The two main reasons I prefer this TV are that there are no side speakers, and the X850A uses a matte screen as opposed to the glass covered screen on the X900A. This TV actually has pretty good sound compared to your average flat panel without the extra three inches on either side of the display. The display also lacks most of the light reflectivity of the glass covered X900A thanks to its matte finish. I'm sure some of you reading this are thinking are thinking something like \"Matte finish scratches easily\" but if you clean it properly with a clean damp microfiber cloth you will never have that problem. I like to use Endust LCD and Plasma Screen Cleaner to clean with and it works great. One other difference between the two sets is this set uses active 3D where the X900A uses passive 3D. I have no opinion on this except that the 3D on this TV looks good to me. Both TV's have 18 month warranties which is exceptional thank you Sony!Games and Blu-Ray look amazing on this TV. I was blown away by the beautiful colors on the Wreck-it Ralph Blu-Ray I used to demo TV the night I bought it. So far I have played GTA 5 on Xbox 360, and The Legend of Zelda Windwaker on Wii U on the X850A. Both games look amazing with much richer color and smoother looks then on my prior TV a 40\" Sharp Aquos Quatron from 2010. Black levels are great on this TV but are not plasma level. It does have some of the best blacks I have seen on an LED LCD TV though. I did not buy a 4K player but the 4K content I saw in store was jaw dropping. In one short film demo I saw at Best Buy on Sony's 4K player of a beach it appeared as though your were looking through a window at the image. Gorgeous blues, greens, and reds were displayed with a crisp brightness that I have never seen on a TV. Still I will probably just wait for PS4's already announced 4K video streaming capabilities to be released.Hopefully this review will help if you are thinking of buying this beautiful TV thanks for reading!", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Super nice picture", "Author": "Billwpp \"Billwpp\"", "ReviewID": "R2V3WMOH5SQOAD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this tv after the price fell to 2,499.

The delivery was on time as scheduled and the delivery guy was very nice and helpful. He brought the tv in our home, unpacked it, made sure it was not damaged and offered to place it on the stand for me. Good service I thought !! Now for the tv itself. It is a 4k tv and there is some controversy as if it will be able to accept 4 k streaming from Netflix and other companies or if it will require a new piece of equipment. I don't know and don't really care. The picture on this tv is the best I have seen on any tv. The 4 scale upscale seems to work and blu rays and HD broadcast pictures are just incredible. The 3d is the best I have seen and the tv comes with four active 3d glasses. The first night we watched Tangled in 3 d and it was amazing. The colors, picture quality and 3d quality is just great. When I first plugged in the set the tv automatically downloaded a software update, can't beat that. I could not be happier with a tv that only 6 months ago cost $4,000. A great tv by anyone's standards.UPDATEOk, I have had this tv for several days and I am blown away. Watching a blu ray on this is like watching a color tv for the first time. I'm old enough to remember that. My wife and I watched Frozen tonight and the picture was incredible. My son, who is a self described audiophile said the picture was the best he has seen. I can't imagine the 4k getting any better but I will find out this weekend when I hook up the Sony 4k media player.

Connect all the cabling, power up the TV, run through the initial set-up. If you have a wired LAN, use it.Note: If you have an ARC compatible a/v receiver, connect it to TV HDMI 1. Or, if you have an older receiver (and yes there are still plenty of folks holding out for an a/v receiver with a upgrade to 4K & HDMI 2.0), you can use the TV digital optical output.If you purchased the 4K media player, kudos.  But before connecting it, go ahead and explore the TV functions, update the software, register the TV, etc. And if you don't already have a Playstation Network account - aka Sony Entertainment Network - go ahead and do that.Next, connect your hdmi cabling for the media player (FMP-X1) first (do not connect power yet - save this for last). Connect media player HDMI 1 to TV HDMI 4.  Connect media player HDMI 2 to your a/v receiver HDMI Audio.  Plug in your ethernet. When you are ready, plug in the power.

Take advantage of the 1 year free Netflix (if already a member, you will get a credit to your account - nice!) and Hulu Plus.By the way, yes the free short 4K feature films really are awesome - our kids especially loved the nature and ocean shorts.  Next, decided to watch some of the 4K movies (ten are bundled with the media player) starting with Total Recall (2012) - wow! We know it will take some time for new 4K content to work its way through the pipeline, but meanwhile there is plenty of SuperHD out there; so as a long-time Netflix user, decided to check out Marvel's The Avengers (2012) on this TV - excellent!After a day with the new hardware and 4K content, no complaints.  In fact, I even found myself adding money to my Sony Entertainment account (for the first time in a long while) - too easy to pick up $50 on-line codes right here on Amazon - and looking forward to checking out new 4K content as it becomes available.

I picked this up at my local best buy for $2200, and I could not be happier.First of all, I know there are many people confused about HEVC and what that means for this particular model. This tv is NOT equipped with the codec, but in the end that really is a non-issue. It just means you cannot use the built in apps to stream 4k content. The built in apps are painfully slow anyways. Sony has already announced a new 4k player (stand alone device) that will support the ability to stream 4k content for all of the early adopters. Also, I am sure many other 3rd party companies will release devices that support 4k streaming (new Apple TV or roku possibly).The tv is equipped with 4 hdmi 2.0 ports. However, only one of those ports is 2.0 HDCP 2.2. What that means is any future streaming device or players needs to be plugged into port 4. Again, this is a non-issue since there are sure to be switches to allow more if needed.Now to the tv itself. The picture is fantastic. It makes standard 1080i broadcast from my cable company look nearly like 1080p bluray quality. That may not sound like a big deal but it certainty is. Content that is already delivered in 1080p is more crisp, has better colors, and is overall much sharper. Pacific rim on bluray is mind-blowing good.I love the footprint of this tv. I have a very small tv stand and the circle base of the tv is a perfect fit. The newer model has a very wide base and would require either a wall mount or massive stand.These are the current picture settings I am using. The find them best for movies and sports.

The only content you can view now and in the future will be $35 movies from Sony that you will have to purchase on their $750 media boat anchor. The television lacks the hardware to support the h.265 codec. This codec looks to be the emerging codec that will be used by Netflix and other streaming video providers. Since this can't be accomplished via software, you will not be able to receive any of these streams now or in the futute. The early adopters are being alienated by Sony. I have spent countless hours on the phone with Sony ' s technical support, and they are anything but helpful. I also bought the 4k media player from Sony that was preloaded with 10 movies on the device. You will not get the free movies, since this offer expires December 31st 2013. I spent at least 10 hours or more over the course of 8 phone calls with Sony only to be told under no circumstance will I get these movies. So in closing I have a useless media player and a 1080p television for a mere $4000. The customer service representative at Sony admitted to me that the management at Sony told her that the will do nothing to help early adopters of their 2013 Sony 4K buyers. I told her that they lost a customer for life, and she stated that Sony knew that they would, but that was an acceptable loss. In short, do not buy this or any 2013 Sony 4K products. Instead I would buy 2014 Sony products, or better yet buy from a Company that will stand behind their products. In my case I will return to Samsung.

I really like that you can sit a lot closer without seeing pixelation. A local dealer was selling all Sony's with no tax added and I went with the intention of purchasing the 65-W850A, which looked great too but the $400+ savings on the Xbr changed my mind. Now the prices seem to be dropping a lot more and I don't see a lot of online retailers listing them, not sure what this means yet. Hopefully 4K remains to be supported and it doesn't fade away. Anyway, I've had sony TV's for over 30 years with no problems, setup of the XBR was easy and only took about 10 mins. I sit directly in front of the TV and if I move from side to side I notice a contrast difference but it's not too significant and not a deal breaker. This TV replaces a 7 year old 40\" LCD, the biggest differences are the blacks and colors, they are so rich. I've watched one 3D movie, (Prometheus), the effects were good but I probably need to watch a movie that was optimized for 3D, like Avatar to better judge. I watch antenna network TV and stream from Amazon, so can't comment on any providers. I changed some of the settings, (lowered brightness and color) but I'm still waiting for Cnet to hopefully test and post. I paid $4503 out the door but it now sells for as low as $3798. If 4K is here to stay, this TV will be good for a long time.Update review.I've had the TV for a few months now and I'm constantly amazed at the quality if the picture. Each time I finish a movie, (usually a Bluray sci-fi, animation or stop motion) I'm so blown away by the amount of detail that I feel compelled to write a review on my findings and then I either forget or put it off, thinking that it's not such a big deal. Well I just got through watching both Pacific Rim and Despicable Me 2 in 3D with the family and they were incredible. Because of the room setup, the TV is around 10 feet away, it looks great but I decided to move the couch (temporarily), to a distance of 5 feet. The textures are amazing and the 3D is in your face, we were playfully trying to pop the bubbles that the minions were blowing, they were literal inches away. I've read reviews on tilting your head with the glasses on and losing the 3D but I did not find this, although I did not lay down. The screen gets a little darker, like polarized sunglasses. I've tried changing some of the settings to match those posted by others, some are either too bright or have too much color but it pays to be adventurous, especially with animation, I'm considering buying a calibration DVD. Overall, the picture quality is very good, the worst the picture has been is when watching old re-runs of Frazier or the like on Netflix, I notice artifacts in dark scenes, or some programming on network channels but it's a mixed bag as I've also seen surprisingly good antenna 480i movies. Occasionally I'll notice a little blurring or haloing around fast moving people but I don't have motion blur turned on and I can live with it. I've read reviews on AVS forums and I consider myself picky but can't see the problems others do with this TV, maybe it's a plasma, Samsung, Panasonic rivalry thing. I'll admit I'm partial to Sony but I do a fair amount of research before buying and feel I made the right choice. I  never thought I'd pay this much for a TV and wouldn't have imagined that it would be this enjoyable. It's very immersive watching a 65\" from 5 feet away but there's no room for a coffee table so you'll have to be prepared to move things around a little, it's definitely worth it.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best TV I've ever seen,(and had).", "Author": "R.

I also purchased a Sony DPS790 3D player and a new faster wireless router, the Netgear 6300R. I recommend both of these items as great upgrades.I chose the Sony BDPS790 upgrade for its having two HDMI outputs. I was unsure about my Pioneer Elite receiver's ability to pass the 3D signal properly and I wanted to directly link the players video output directly to the TV and use the other HDMI output to link the audio output to the audio receiver. I also wanted a direct video link from the Sony blu-ray player to the TV to be direct in case the SONY hype about proprietary upscaling algorithms working on only Sony equipment was something other than just marketing hype (shame on me for even thinking that SONY would say this merely to sell more equipment).I also purchased the Spears & Munsil tune up disk but have not yet tried to modify the \"custom\" tuning channel of the TV which I plan to do this weekend so I cannot comment on this but the disk has lots of very positive reviews.

Maybe the artifacts look questionable because I am upgrading this 65\" TV from a previous 55\" Sony TV so the issue may be just a bigger screen and hence bigger artifacts.Its a small price to pay to have your eyeballs fall out of their sockets onto the carpet to be able to watch Avatar in 3D all the way through in such stunning fashion.", "Date": "October 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very happy with TV and with Amazon", "Author": "Mary Island", "ReviewID": "RW178YSY41OHE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this TV to upgrade an older DLP so the quality difference is huge and we are very happy with it.

Love the picture! I also bought the 4k media server, but returned it after seeing how much it costs to buy/rent movies. Just not worth the $700 I paid...especially when you consider the cost of the movies and the time it takes to download. Still though, with the upscaling almost everything looks great.The main problem I have is with streaming Netflix. I have an old (about a year and a half) Sony Blu-ray player and it SUCKS when it comes to Netflix. Constant buffering issues makes Netflix almost unwatchable. After doing a little research, it seems this problem has been well documented, but still has no definite fix. I just figured it was old technology and wrote it off. Unfortunately, this TV is just marginally better when it comes to Netflix. Still get the Pinwheel of Death when watching Netflix. Other applications work fine (by why no VuDu app???)Before I get inundated with fix actions from well intentioned users out there...I have tried everything! Sony blames my IPS and my ISP blames Netflix. I have had ISP techs at the house testing connectivity with no issues. I can stream Netflix from my iPad and smart phone with zero issues...at the same time Netflix is buffering on my tv. The TV is hardwired to the router and my connection speed is 35 down/15 up through Verizon Fios. I have changed the DNS to 8.8.8.8 as recommended by Sony and ensured the TV has the latest firmware updates. No joy.As I said before, this issue seems to be with the way Sony streams the application and had been documented on many help sites.

I bought the 65\" 4k model to fit in my new house - I was so excited to try 4k, since I'm a big fan of great video quality.The $4500 4k TV pairs with a $500 Sony 4k media player, which is the only way to get 4k content into it so far. It's not cheap, but I really wanted to go 4k so I got one of each. My 4k player worked once, then froze up during downloading a movie, and I never saw it since. Sony tech support blamed my Apple router, so I replaced that with a Netgear. Then they blamed the fact that I had a switch and a router, and it was clear that they had little or no networking knowledge and was just trying to shift the blame.The media player unit has no remote, no feedback to the user, and the tech support personnel themselves don't know what the error codes on the TV meant. They are utterly incapable of admitting they have a problem product, and they are rude even after holding on the phone with them for hours over a period of days. The 4k player is junk, and so is their support, it's heading back to the store.I'll still give 4k TV a few days grace before returning, but I'm unlikely to change my mind. The picture quality is not bad, but It's a poorly designed product, e.g the Ethernet on the unit is only designed to do 10/100, not Gigabit Ethernet. This is ludicrous given that 4k content is massive amounts of data, and GigE is available in even the cheapest laptops these days. I actually do have > 100Mbps download speed, but the only real application I have for this (HD movies) won't be able to utilize the full bandwidth due to TV's poor specs.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "AWESOME TV!", "Author": "Hunter", "ReviewID": "RPQAZS1DQ09DJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome feeling when you watch 3D Movies with this TV.

The sales rep that I spoke to had me under the impression that it would be delivered sometime within the week...didn't end up getting it till the following Thursday. That aside the TV itself was great, exceptional picture quality, even the 3D looks great although it is active not passive which I know some dislike (any windows or other light sources WILL flicker when you have the glasses on so it is best done in a dark room or at night). The glasses that come with the TV are light, comfortable, and can be worn over glasses as far as that goes.Do note that with 4k content right now the data transfer rates limit the fps to 24 Hz, I don't know if these TVs can support higher framerates/refresh rates at full 4k resolution and I couldn't find any clarification of this anywhere I looked, but HDMI 2.0 is a moot point if the TV can't go beyond this limitation.So when I finally got my TV it worked great for about 5 hours but then went out and the bottom LED started blinking red and the screen wouldn't turn on. I immediately called the support line and after instructing me to try unplugging and replugging it they told me they would send out a replacement. Hopefully this was just bad luck but nevertheless something to be careful about.Also this should go without saying but the free shipping does not include installation but DO plug in your TV and make sure the screen comes on and there isn't any cracks before the delivery personnel leave to save you some time and unnecessary headache.***Update 10/14***Got my new set a few days ago (8 days since my previous one malfunctioned).  So far no similar problems with the new set. I'll touch on a few things herePicture/image quality:-The default settings produce a nice crisp image, viewing from my couch about 10 feet away I haven't had any regrets except for an ironically poor decision to rewatch The Ring because it happened to be on a couple nights a ago :(-The picture adjustment settings are easy to navigate through and rather intuitive, it does come with a variety of presets.  I had to adjust a few settings to reduce the \"soap opera effect\" that was occuring with movies and tv series.  If you don't feel comfortable adjusting those settings I suppose you can get your TV proffesionally calibrated but I hardly feel that is necessary for the average user.-I attached my gaming PC with nvidia 770 graphics card to the TV just for kicks, it recognized the 4k res but I had to plug in the HDMI to my home theater box otherwise my PC was only recognizing 2 channel audio not 5.1 (and yes my theater system is plugged into the ARC port).  Hopefully it was just the HDMI 1.4 issue but fps was limited to the 24 fps at 4k res, 3D was not compatible in this res but worked fine with Crysis on 1080p.  Again I really hope this TV can support higher FPS at 4k res once HDMI 2.0 comes out.TV Apps/connectivity-The TV recognized my PLEX server and I was able to play videos without difficulty, It has several standard apps (netflix, hulu, pandora, etc) but as far as I could tell there is no PLEX app.-Was able to recognize my ipad and phone via bluetooth which can be used to control some things (such as playing youtube videos).  With all the wireless capabilities it made me wonder why they have so many USB ports on this thing, although more is always better right?", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not happy with the skin tones.", "Author": "TRex", "ReviewID": "R2FIE0D9135PZS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had this TV for 48 hours and then returned it.

BUT ONCE YOU CONFIRM THE ORDER IT IS ALL DOWN HILL FROM THERE.(I WILL NUMBER ALL THE EVENTS I WENT THROUGH)1. PURCHASED A W900A ON MARCH 3RD AND GOT IT ON TIME, TOOK IT OUT OF THE BOX AND SET UP THE TV. UPON SETTING IT UP I NOTICED WITHIN A FEW HOURS THAT THERE WAS SOME SORT OF BLOTCHY' NESS AROUND THE SCREEN. KINDA LOOKED LIKE CLOUDS ON REALLY DARK SCENES. I CALLED UP SONY EXPLAINED MY PROBLEM AND THEY TOLD ME THAT WAS NORMAL. NOTHING ABOUT THIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED NORMAL ESPECIALLY IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A $2000.00 TV. SO A FEW PHONE CALLS LATER I GOT THEM TO SEND ME A NEW TV.2. RECEIVED THE NEW TV BEGINNING OF APRIL SAME TV W900A. AND AGAIN I HAD THE SAME PROBLEMS, NOT AS MUCH AS THE FIRST ONE BUT ENOUGH TO SEE IT AND NOT LIKE IT. CALLED BACK SONY WITHIN HOURS BECAUSE NOW I KNOW WHAT I'AM LOOKING FOR. ON THE PHONE FOR 1HR THEY TOLD ME THEY WOULD SEND OUT A TECH TO SEE MY TV BECAUSE I WAS PAST MY 30 DAY MANUFACTURE WARRANTY. I SAID HOW IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE I GOT A BRAND NEW TV WHICH CARRIES A NEW 30 DAY WARRANTY FOR REASONS LIKE THIS. THEY TOLD ME THEY PLACED THE TV ON THE OLD TV'S WARRANTY AND ORDER NUMBER. LOL. I HUNG UP WITH THEM AFTER FIGHTING AND ARGUING AND GETTING NOWHERE.3. FEW DAYS LATER I SEE THE XBR55850A 4K TV FOR $2299.99 ONLINE I CALL THEM UP AND TELL THEM I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN THE W900A AND UPGRADE TO A NEW TV AND PAY FOR IT, I WASN'T LOOKING FOR ANY DISCOUNT OR ANYTHING. I JUST WANTED TO GET A NICE TV AND HAVE NO PROBLEMS. THE REP TOLD ME I CANT RETURN MY TV EVEN THOUGH I WAS SPENDING MORE MONEY. IT WAS PAST THE 30 DAY WARRANTY. I FOUGHT AGAIN AND GOT A SUPERVISOR TO HEAR ME OUT. 2 HOURS LATER HE AGREES TO RETURN MY TV AND PLACE THE ORDER FOR ME. HE THEN TELLS ME THAT I HAVE TO RETURN MY W900A WAIT 5-7 DAYS FOR THE ORDER TO PROCESS THEN WAIT 2 DAYS FOR A NEW ORDER TO BE CREATED THEN 5-7 DAYS FOR SHIPMENT AND IT TO GET TO MY HOUSE. I LAUGHED OUT LOUD AND ASKED IF THEY COULD PROCESS A RETURN OVER THE PHONE AND SEND ME THE NEW TV WHEN THEY PICK UP THE OLD TV. HE SAID NO WITHOUT HESITATION. HE THEN PUT ME ON HOLD AND WITHIN 10 SECONDS THE PHONE GOT DISCONNECTED (HUNG UP ON)4. CALLED BACK THE NEXT DAY APRIL 15TH AND FINALLY GOT SOMEONE TO HELP ME. WELL SO I THOUGHT. WE AGREED ON EVERYTHING FROM THE RETURN TO THE SHIPPING TO THE PRICE. I GOT A REFERENCE NUMBER AND WAS FINALLY HAPPY. THE NEXT MORNING I GOT AN EMAIL SAYING THAT THERE WAS A PICK UP SCHEDULED FOR A RETURN BUT THAT'S IT NOTHING WAS WRITTEN DOWN AS A NEW TV COMING. I WAS PIST5. CALLED BACK TODAY APRIL 17TH SPOKE TO A SALES REP THAT TOLD ME THAT NOTHING WAS PLACED FOR A NEW TV ONLY A RETURN PICK UP. THEN HE TOLD ME THAT THEY COULD NOT HONOR THE PRICE OF $2299.99 BECAUSE THE INTERNET PRICE IS FOR $2499.99 AND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY MORE MONEY. I TOLD HIM TO LOOK AT THE NOTES AND SEE WHAT WAS DISCUSSED YESTERDAY AND JUST WRITE ME UP FOR THE NEW TV. HE AGAIN TOLD ME NO. I JUST WANTED TO GET OFF THE PHONE WITH HIM I AGREED TO PAY MORE, I HAD TO PAY $300.00 OUT OF POCKET BECAUSE I HAD A CERTAIN AMOUNT ON MY GE FINANCE CARD. AGAIN HE TELLS ME NO, THEY CANT DO THAT. I CANT USE 2 CREDIT CARDS. I WOULD HAVE TO BUY A GIFT CARD THE AMOUNT OWED AND USE THAT. AND IF THERE IS A PROBLEM AND I NEED TO RETURN THE TV I WOULD GET MY CREDIT BACK ON A GIFT CARD FOR SONY ONLY. MAKES NO SENSE SO I DIDN'T END UP BUYING ANYTHING. AND HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT THAT TV WAS NEVER ON SALE FOR $2299.99 SO NOW THEY ARE CALLING ME A LIAR. SO FED UP WITH THIS EXPERIENCE I TOLD THEM TO PICK UP THE TV AND CREDIT ME BACK. HE TOLD ME THAT THEY WOULD NOT DO THAT, THEY WILL PICK UP THE TV AND SEND ME OUT A REPLACEMENT TV BECAUSE MY 30 DAYS WAS UP BECAUSE THEY CONTINUE TO PUT THE NEW TV UNDER THE OLD TV WARRANTY. SO EVERYTHING WAS FOR NOTHING AND THEY DON'T WANT TO HELP ME OUT. I MEAN I WAS WILLING TO SPEND MORE MONEY WITH THEM AND I DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING FOR FREE AND I WASN'T ASKING FOR ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY.

That's right, they currently have 900 million products on the market.  No one is asking the important question that needs to be asked, how in the world can they keep parts for 900 million products, give or take one or two?  As I learned, they can not and DO NOT keep parts but for a short time.  I learned after 7 years from the date of manufacture, not the date of your purchase, but the date of manufacture, there is NO service and there are NO parts available for these very expensive video and audio components.  There is no discussion, the date of manufacture is the first thing the Sony Laredo repair facility looks at on any product, if the products is over seven years old  (date of manufacture), they will no longer service it or provide parts for it.  So, as much as I enjoy Sony products, they are just not practical as they cannot be serviced but for a short time, and if I am going to spend literally thousands of dollars on a product, I look far past the warranty period and you only have seven years from the date of manufacture, and then you, like me, have a product on your hands that cannot be repaired, as there are no parts, and they won't touch it.
