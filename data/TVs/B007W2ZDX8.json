{"Reviews": [{"Title": "**OK TV, HORRIBLE COMPANY**", "Author": "Andrea Sidlo", "ReviewID": "R3V2837V5EDYY6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this TV in March when our old LCD broke. There weren't that many reviews at the time, however when I saw the price and figured I would give it a shot. The screen is great for the price, sound is less then desirable (typical for any thin tv). Everything was fine for about 4 months, but then the AV plugs just died. There are limited HDMI ports, so the sound bar I purchased for the TV, which was an AV connection only, was useless.I decided to use my warranty and trade it in for a working model... Big mistake! First thing that was odd, Seiki made ME pay for the shipping to return their broken product. I didn't keep my box so had to buy a separate TV box just to ship it. It was inconvenient, but at least they got it (or so I thought). UPS tracking # confirmed that it was received on 8/5/2013. I figured I would allow a few days for processing, so I called 10 days later. It was confirmed that they received it, the warranty would cover a new TV to be shipped but would not be shipped out until the following Tuesday. Tuesday came, it wasn't shipped. I was told it would be ready at the end of the week. The end of the week came, still not sent.... Long story short, after several attempts to call Seiki and them having this TV for more than a month now, I haven't had any luck. The CSR's for this company are completely useless and seriously lack \"customer service\". I have dealt with more than 15 different reps, all of which are just as rude as the last person.I am giving 1 star only for the nightmare this company has put me through. It would have received a higher rating if it did not break. God help you if you buy a broken model and need to return it, because I know Seiki won't.", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Low Quality TV, and Worse Distributor", "Author": "Sean", "ReviewID": "R1OMN1D9843HOD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The TV showed up quickly, but once I started it up I quickly realized how low quality it was. After about 30 minutes of fooling around with the visual settings I gave up and went back to a preset; the color of the display was just off no matter what I did. The speakers were just horrible. The sound was muffled and off. The TV was also advertised as 120Hz but when I was using it the screen would tell me that it was running in 60Hz and I could find nothing in the manual on how to fix that. I bought this TV to replace my $400 TV and it was worse in every way.The worst part of the TV for me was the HUGE input lag it had with my consoles. I could feel how long it took for any action I took to happen on screen and made any game impossible to play.So I begrudgingly and disappointingly decided to return it. This is where the 1 star really comes into play. The distributor \"wesaveyou$\" charges a 20% restocking fee. This means that just to return the TV it was going to cost me $100. Then they wouldn't even pay for shipping. So I was down another $80. Even though this was a lot of money, what other choice did I have? Either be out $500 from the TV or $180 for returning.This experience was just a huge waste of time and money. I will not ever consider purchasing from this \"company\" again and I strongly suggest the rest of you avoid it as well unless you are 100% certain that what you are buying is what you want.", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "good and fast", "Author": "william hood", "ReviewID": "R1E2XYLBQBMPKH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I read a lot of bad reviews and thought I made a bad choice buying this 42 inch flat screen ....

The technology has matured to the point that even low end models can be very impressive.  My only negative experience was with a previous Seiki model.  After testing out the SE421TT, I'm afraid that it was not just a fluke.BUILDThe appearance of this television is very understated, with the traditional glossy black plastic.  The bezel is bigger than some modern TVs, so take the dimensions into account if you plan on putting it into an entertainment center. Overall, the look says \"cheap,\" but it doesn't scream it.On the other Seiki TV I reviewed, the stand was surprisingly flimsy.  This is again the case with the SE421TT.  The plastic is very soft, so be careful not to use much force to avoid stripping the screw holes.  Also, the TV leans forward a bit, but not dramatically.  On the bright side, the stand on this model does swivel left and right some.PICTURE QUALITYThe first thing that struck me about the picture was how blown out the colors were.  I am not super picky about this, but I calibrated it before doing any other tests.  After calibration, the colors were still somewhat blotchy, but much better.  The video I watched was with an HDMI connection at 1080p, and overall it did the job.  Motion was noticeably bad, with smearing during action or camera pans.  If you used one of the early LCD HDTVs, you probably know what I mean.  Also, there is some softness and artifacting, likely from some sort of processing that can't be turned off in the settings.  While these set the picture quality below the current standard for budget TVs, I want to emphasize that it is not horrible and may be just fine for your purposes.Black levels are average for this price and the backlighting is uneven. In practice, this is only obvious in very dark scenes.I also tested the TV with a PC via the HDMI connection and the results were pretty awful. Overscan can't be turned off (at least in the firmware on my set). This means that the edges will be cut off if you do not adjust your settings on the PC. More importantly, text is very blurry, with artifacts around the edges. This may be okay for PC gaming, but it actually hurts my head when I try surfing the web.I find that many people turn their noses up at quantitative testing. I understand why and didn't use any to write this review. The thing that I like about it is that, while we all have our biases, numbers simply are what they are. With that in mind, I've posted some chromaticity diagrams in the customer images.REMOTEThe remote is pretty nicely laid out. It requires aiming directly at the TV.SUPPORTI thankfully had no reason to contact support, but I did last year in regard to another Seiki TV, which had dead pixels.  I spent a very long time on hold, but was eventually told that they would replace it if I sent the TV in at my expense.  I tried email support first, but it was useless.  The whole thing reminded me of working with my cable company.CONCLUSIONSThe SE421TT is not terrible, but it is well below average in picture and build quality within its price range.  The only reason I would consider recommending it is if the price drops much lower than the prices of other brands such as Westinghouse or Vizio.EDIT:  When I was moving the TV, the stand snapped off!  That could have been dangerous!

After 10 months of operation the Seiki screen flickered and there was no picture.  The warranty states 1 year in the home repair.  We called the number and was told to call back with serial numbers...etc.  We called back and was put on hold for over an hour.  Repeated calls to Seiki's warranty number got the same results.  After much frustration I called Amazon and explained my problem....twice and twice I was told that they would follow up and either call me back or email me with a solution.  Needless to say I have not heard back from Amazon.  As a Prime Member and the only time I needed help from the Big \"A\" they have terribly defaulted on the value of my membership.  I do know that if this had been purchased from Sams, COSTCO or Best Buy and I walked in with this problem it would be solved...at the cost of the manufacturer...who in this case was good at ignoring the service end.

It's primarily used by kids to watch cartoons or for playing video games. For those uses, I can't imagine finding anything that works better (but I can find plenty that cost much more). My 4 star rating is in part due to the fact that this is a \"value\" priced TV. We have a larger, more expensive TV for watching movies and sports, but the kids use this one way more often.The only negative I've encountered with it is watching sports. With only a 60hz refresh rate, fast motion blurs a tad and some of the detail seems less crisp than I get on my Samsung in the family room. That said, it's not bad enough to be considered a major problem (just enough to drop it from 5 to 4 stars).If you're looking for a centerpiece HD TV, this probably isn't going to fit your needs, but if you just need something to hang on the wall so you can have something to watch while playing ping pong or foosball, this TV is perfect.This is not the best TV out there by a long shot, but it's probably one of the best values for your money out there.", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Big and Quick!", "Author": "Matthew Clegg", "ReviewID": "R1S9KXE1DWRZGG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It arrived almost instantly and was bigger than I was anticipating!All in all, one of the best late-night purchases I've made.  ;-)", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Junk", "Author": "2ndammendment", "ReviewID": "R2YXMS5NLIF4NY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Stopped working after three weeks, screen burned out. volume isn't loud enough to be clearly heard across the room even on max.", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hate Seiki!!!!", "Author": "Bryce", "ReviewID": "R2SGCN993RMIFP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Okay first off got a 40 inch about 6 months ago everything was great worked good looked good and all. Then i come home to the tv will not even turn on. Here is the part where all goes downhill. Called Seiki, if you are lucky enough to reach them it only takes like 30 or 40 minutes on hold yay. Then after talking to them and letting them know the problem next thing was I have to send the tv back and pay and box it. Around a hundred dollars just to send a broken tv back. Tracked my package through ups. i saw that it had arrived so i was curious to call Seiki to see how everything was going. After a few attempts of no answers and holding for an hour finally someone answers. They did not even have a clue my package was there. So now they give me a new case number. Tell me that this is the last step then we can send you your replacement tv. Then the same day like an hour after i talked to them they send me an email saying we do not have a proof of purchase which had to be sent in the package which i did so where did it go? In conclusion i tried to call them the next day just to verify that they had it. I Have called the past four business days and its the same thing stay on hold for an hour then a message comes on saying all reps are busy. So today i called right when they opened their lines same thing and i have tried at least 5 or 6 times and no answer they are quote \"too busy,\" just wondering how they can be so busy to never answer.

Gildart", "ReviewID": "R2J92I4CJBNBKL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First and foremost, in deciding what you are willing to pay for this bargain tv, you should include the costs of buying a decent stand and some speakers or a sound bar.  The stand that came with my TV broke within a couple of months (the panel is too heavy for the cheap plastic - we made do by drilling extra holes crossways and adding screws, but that it certainly not a living room friendly solution).  The speakers built into the TV are abysmal and won't do in a room that has any other noise.This is my second Seiki. I also have a 40 inch Seiki [[ASIN:B004NF1KES Seiki LC40G81 40\" 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV] ]and I like that one a lot. I like this one, too, but not as much.This is a budget television, no doubt about it. The frame is made of plastic that neither looks nor feels expensive. When installing the stand, you want to be very careful to get those screws in all the way (without stripping them), or else the television will not be steady on the stand. The rest of the set up process was very easy. Probably my favorite thing about this television is that it has component and composite inputs, meaning that I can still use my older dvd player and dish network dvr with it. One thing to be aware of, though, is that it has only one analog audio input, so you can use a component video source and a composite video source, but you can only get audio from one of those devices.The size difference between 40 and 42 inches is more noticeable than what I thought it would be. If bigger is better for you, or if you are replacing a tv that's 42 inches or larger, I think you might like this one - the SE421TT - better. The picture is not quite as good, and there is some fade out at the edges, but the blacks are nice and deep, and the colors are vibrant. The first thing I watched was a PBS HD documentary on elephants, and the picture was quite stunning. The television sits on a high boy dresser in my bedroom, and the viewing angle is still excellent from down low.Using input from a standard definition dish network dvr, the picture was considerably less stellar, with blurring and occasional lag. My 40 inch tv does a noticeably better job of rendering from the satellite dish. Both televisions are excellent for over the air HD content, and the 42 inch tv, surprisingly, did a better job of connecting with my Mac Mini over a dvi-to-hdmi cable. Unlike the 40 inch, which is a newer model, the 42 inch gives full 1080p with no over-scaling.The sound is where the 42 inch falls apart. Tinny, weak, and truly awful out of the box. I was able to get an acceptable sound for a bedroom tv (which is what I am using this for) by playing with the equalizer and presets (I set it to jazz and dynamic). I do not think it would work in a busier, louder room. For now, the picture and sound are enough better on the 40 inch that I have decided to keep that one as my living room tv (my living room is tiny), but the 42 inch is great in the bedroom.I shopped around a long time before I bought the 40 inch tv, because I've got serious budget constraints, and I needed something I could afford AND that I wouldn't regret buying every time I tried to watch it. Now that I have both of these, I have to say that I still think the 40 inch is the better bargain with two \"unlesses\" - 1. Get the 42 inch if size really matters to you, and 2. Get the 42 inch if your primary video source is going to be 1080p dvi-to-hdmi (i.e. you have cut your cable and are using a computer as your main source of entertainment). If that's the case, you'll probably want to get a decent set of speakers to go along with this.", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "seiki tv", "Author": "Shellbell", "ReviewID": "R2Y3CZ082EJQ1Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great picture.

There were three issues that would prevent me from ever recommending this product, and in truth I will have a hard time buying something like this online in the future.The first issue arose when i removed the tv and base from the carton and installed the base. The base is built rather cheaply and is held on by four screws. I installed the screws being careful not to over tighten them as they screw into plastic. Immediately upon setting the tv upright three of the screws and the plastic broke free. The stand is now useless.While this was bad enough I had long range plans to mount the tv so it was not a deal breaker. As I began to attach the hardware to the tv the first three screws of four came out well. The fourth screw was unable to be removed. When trying to unscrew the fourth you could actually see a bulge in the plastic as the screw was loosened. I now have the tv mounted with only three screws instead of the four needed.The final issue is sound quality which is very tinny.If this was not a \"gift from Santa\" for the kids it would have immediately been returned.

Video is acceptable and well worth the price.  A couple months before the 1-year warranty expired the unit started to die intermittently then a month before it went out completely. Average wait-time on customer support is 15 minutes with a one-time call on hold of 40. Seiki outsources their support to a company based in Michigan who does not have control over replacement units.  It took over 2 months to receive a warranty replacement and when it arrived the screen was damaged in shipment taking another 3 weeks to get the replacement.The replacement is a 50\" as Seiki no longer makes the 42\".  Sound is now acceptable, video is great however there are software issues with the \"Favorite\" function.  When purchasing the unit best to find out if there is local warranty support.

However, we are concerned about th instability of the base of the unit.  Upon receipt we installed the base and set it on the stand that would be it's home.  Fortunately I did not step away from the TV as it almost immediately fell forward.  THe base unit broken.  Upon checking I found that the screw receptibles split open.  When we first placed the TV I found it was very tipsy.  Contact was made with the manafacturer and they sent us a new stand assembley.  That was installed, but again we find it quite tipsy.  We have looked at some similar units at retailers and found that both the 40\" and 46\" seemed much more stable even though the pedistals seemed to quite similar.  Fortunately we do not have small children around.  We do believe the instability of the pedistal could pose a danger.

Any other specifications were secondary in my list of preferences.I use this TV as my main and only TV.PROS:This Seiki has good picture quality, brightness and color. Runs really well with my Blu-ray and PS3.It is very thin and looks expensive.The remote control is easy to use and the menus are pretty simpleCONS:The tv screen has some uniformity issues. If you look at the screen when is displaying a black background you'll see big brighter areas in the corners and random areas of the screen. These areas look like mild reflections of light (like the reflection of a window in the screen) and are not noticeable when watching any other colors but black. I did a little research and it looks like budget LCD and LED TVs have these kind of issues. These reflections or uniformity issues might annoy you a bit at first but, you get used to them in no time.As other reviews stated, sound quality is poor.CONCLUSION:Great bang for your buck. Looks good and has good picture quality. You are better off if you connect the Seiki to a home theater system as the tv speakers offer no bass at all", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's good enough if the price is good enough but consider 40\"", "Author": "L. Knights", "ReviewID": "R2MJOC1GMQOJ8W", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had a 42\" tv for six years until last year I actually replaced it with a 40\" Seiki. When I looked at the old one and the newer Seiki side by side, the screen had no real size difference. I mean, if I didn't know which one was the 42\" and which was the 40\", I probably could have guessed correctly which one was which with greater than 50% accuracy, but it's really tough to tell. Now I have this 42\" Seiki and once again, it's hard to tell the two sizes apart. At least until you look at the prices. Both sizes are really good for a college dorm, a larger bedroom or a smaller living room, so I would say why not save money and a bit of weight by getting the slightly 40\" version?As to the actual tv - well, this is not going to win any awards for superb quality. It's a cheap tv, so if you find it at a good price, and what is most important is just to have a big screen tv and not a super high quality tv, then I guess...get it. The remote is decent. The picture quality is acceptable. The base is a bit flimsy and if you can get a separate surround sound system or external speakers then DO IT, you will be much happier. One thing I noticed about this particular tv is that the box it came in wasn't very good. The one my first (40\") Seiki came in was better but this one didn't seem to have a good place for the UPS guy to grip it or anything and the bottom was falling out a bit and the top flaps seemed to be ripped where people had grabbed it to handle it. Someone should have spent an extra dollar on a better box I think. There's another reason to get the 40\" - the slightly smaller size and weight are going to make it that much less likely to get manhandled too badly in shipping.Oh...one other thing...the trend seems to be to put more hdmi inputs and less video inputs in these tvs. If you have hdmi cables with everything you have then great, but I have to go to the back of the tv and switch the cables out on a few things all the time because I need more video inputs and it's a pain. I am probably going to buy a new DVD player - or better yet a Blue Ray player since those play DVDs as well - just so I can get something with an HDMI cable. You don't want to be moving the tv around that much to get to the cables in the back when the base is so flimsy.", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Slim LED with screen thickness of 4\"\nBrightness: 300 cd/m2\nAspect Ratio: 16:9 and Dynamic Contrast Ratio: 40000:1\nResponse Time: 6.5 ms and Refresh Rate: 60Hz\nBuilt in 3D PAL/NTSC Comb Filterwith Built in 3D Video Noise Reduction", "Name": "Seiki SE421TT 42-Inch 1080p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/310Gy1rwkHL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007W2ZDX8"}}
