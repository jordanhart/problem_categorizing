I'd say it's also a work of art.I have a high definition cable box with an HDMI cable to the TV and the HD channels are superb.  I mean, the picture is totally 100% crystal clear.  I have windows behind me and somehow there is virtually no glare.  Yes, the TV looks better when it is dark outside versus light outside but it's perfectly great when it is light outside.I'm writing this review on my couch.  My laptop is connected to the TV via a VGA cable with a wireless keyboard and mouse.  Unfortunately my laptop does not have HDMI but I can see very well with the VGA cable.  Needless to say, I am going to become much more lazy as a result of this TV.The 40 inches is great for my viewing pleasure.  I'm sure 46 is bigger but I am 100% content with 40 inches.  It comes down to price.  I did not want to pay more than $1,200 for a TV (that's $100 a month for 12 months using the Amazon Store Card).  So this was a no-brainer for me.If you are in the market for a TV, I highly suggest this one.  It is truly a wonderful TV.The \"only\" thing that isn't 100% perfect is the sound.  The sound is good mind you, but it is not as perfect as the picture.  But for the record, I have not played with the equalizer which people report helps the sound.This is an amazing TV.UPDATE 6/12/2008:  This is still a remarkable television.  I don't have any complaints about it at all.  Even the sound is perfectly fine.  However, you MUST either have a Blu Ray player or an Upconvert player with an HDMI cable to get the full benefit.  Everything looks and sounds perfect on this TV.UPDATE 7/13/2008:  The TV is still perfect so just buy it already!  I actually bought a 26\" 3-series for my bedroom.  I don't notice too much of a difference; I am happy with this \"worse\" TV as I am with my living room TV (this one).  Samsung makes an excellent LCD television!FINAL UPDATE 3/19/2009: Well I've had this TV about a year and I can honestly say it still is great.  The sound is great, too.  But... in retrospect, when it comes to TVs, bigger is better.  A year ago this TV was $1,200 and I just paid it off this month.  But if I could have gotten a 42\" or a 46\", then that would be better.  Don't get me wrong, the 40\" is great, but what's wrong with a few extra inches?  Either way  you can't go wrong with the LCD 5 Series from Samsung.", "Date": "April 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Picture - Great Service", "Author": "Rob. B \"Rrrrob\"", "ReviewID": "RVBWB3XH38GX0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One of my biggest purchases with Amazon and it went as smooth as possible.  The picture on this TV is amazing.  FiOS HD can be almost too much pretty on one screen with this TV, it's a bit overwhelming at first.  Standard def channels are of course a less clear but better than expected.  The only issue I have with this TV is the length of time to power on and off.  You also have to point the remote just right sometimes or the function won't register.  Small issue though, hardly worth docking points off this unit.The menu is wonderful and gives complete control over settings.  Each input saves your settings too!  The AVS Forums have a great thread concerning settings for each input that should be checked out and tested.  A little tweaking got the black levels and skin tone just right.I haven't tested the VGA input, but my Macbook Pro connected with a DVI-HDMI cable is amazing!  My FiOS is connected via HDMI and as I mentioned, quite beautiful.  I also have a Wii hooked up via component.  The Wii maxes out at 480p but really shines on this TV despite the 1080p native res.  Don't be fooled though, the picture is a little fuzzy but through some tweaking you can get a great picture without springing for a separate upconverter.Shipping was of course through Eagle/CEVA.  Make sure to call and verify they've got your info.  They didn't have my phone number on record at first so I corrected that.  My delivery man was Rick.  He was great!  He called to setup the appointment, was on time, very delicate with the unit, and very personable.  I couldn't be more pleased.UPDATE: Just wanted to mention the finish of the screen.  Originally, I was debating between this model and the older lnt4069fx due to the matte screen.  I chose this model for several reasons.  First, it was cheaper. Second, I decided 120Hz wasn't worth the extra 400 bucks. Third, the screen isn't glossy but it isn't matte it's more of an in-between, satin-like finish that works great in my TV watching room that has a glass front door to the outside and 2 windows.  Glare isn't a problem at all for me even with lamps behind me.  It really is great.  The ultra gloss on the 600 and 700 models are way to much for my multipurpose room.  Hope that helps anyone on the fence that cares about gloss vs. matte finishes.", "Date": "May 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Caution:  Known HDMI issue", "Author": "J. R. Wechezak \"Joe\"", "ReviewID": "R1BCDOBBK70H1A", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased the Samsung LN40A550 40\" 1080p LCD HDTV on July 14, 2008.  It's my 4th big screen HDTV purchase but my first 1080p box.  Agree with other reviews in that it has an absolute beautiful picture at a very good price.  There are many features I love about this TV, but here's the problem....I purchased a Samsung 1080P8 upconverting DVD player with an HDMI (version 1.3) cable.  When i watch a DVD, i get a 'searching for signal' message that appears on the screen for about 5 seconds.  This happens once every minute or two! I went into full troubleshooting mode by replacing the cable, the DVD player, and everything else i could think of.  I tried the DVD player and HDMI cable with my other HDTV sets and it worked great.  After calling Samsung technical support and getting to their level 2 support in New Jersey, they acknowledged there is a problem with the HDMI connection with the TV but they do not have a firmware fix for it yet.  They suggested i wait for the firmware fix (release date unknown), or return the TV and try another one.  I opted to exchange the TV for the same model.  I received it today and (unfortunately) it has the same problem.  I will now return the TV to Amazon, get a refund, and purchase a different model.Bottom line, if you don't use or need the HDMI connection, you should be fine with this set.  However, if you plan to use HDMI I'd look to a different model until this is fixed.Update on July 28 - After further troubleshooting, the HDMI problem is with the combination of using a Samsung LN40A550 40\" 1080p LCD HDTV with the Samsung 1080P8 upconverting DVD player.  Together, they do not work.  Separately, the upconverting DVD player works perfectly with other TVs, and the Samsung LN40A550 works fine with another upconverting DVD.  I purchased the same brand so i would eliminate this exact problem!  Who would think that Samsung has not tested their own product compatibility before they go out the door?  Exremely poor quality control - my guess is they have a problem with their 'anynet' software feature, but it still blanks-out with 'anynet' turned off.  Purchase the Sony upconverting DVD player with this TV and you'll be OK.  However, now I personally don't trust Samsung.", "Date": "July 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great tv for the price", "Author": "W. McCracken", "ReviewID": "R5HB9IJAOT3QY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hello,I have had my tv since April 25, 2008, and thought is was time to give some input that should be helpful for anyone looking to buy. I am very happy with it and would highly recomend it. Simply, it is the best price vs quality on the market. I use it for Fios HD, PS3 gaming and blu-rays.First, I bought it online from Amazon when it was at its lowest price (much cheaper than BB or CC with sales or coupons). It was delivered within 5 minutes of when CEVA told me they would be there. The driver brought it in, we opened it up and set it up. Looked good, then signed for it and he was off. CEVA is supposed to help set it up (Amazon white glove service). Remember, never sign for anything until after you see it!!After about a week I noticed (on solid color scenes) that the screen was ununiform. One area from top to bottom about 3 inches wide was much lighter that the rest of the screen. I had Samsung service come out and they told me \"I have never seen anything like this before.\" Samsung told be they would need to replace the panel (not the tv). I did not want a \"rebuilt\" tv after just getting it, so I called Amazon. Amazon was happy to send me a replacement and CEVA delivered it and picked up the old set. The new set has no problems.I decided on the 550 because I do not feel the 120hz 650 model is worth the extra $500. Also, the room is very bright during the day and I did not want the glare that the 650 would give. However, if I had a dark room and the extra cash, I would have picked the 650 for the much higher contrast ratio and the option to use the 120hz.My setup is a 40A550, PS3, Fios HD, my laptop, and an Onkyo TX-SR506 with Infinity speakers for surround sound. The Fios and the PS3 are connected to the tv using [...] HDMI cables and optical cables (for surround sound) run to the Onkyo from the PS3 and FIOS. I tweaked the settings on the tv using combinations of some posts of I found online and what i felt looked natural.The speakers on the tv are just ok, but what I would expect from a flat tv. I generally use the Onkyo for surround sound.If I would rate this tv, I would give it 4 stars out of 5 stars because of its poor PIP setup. The PIP will only work with analog through the RF connection. The channel cannot be changed without going into the menu screen. And since analog is going to be turned off by Feb. 09, is will be useless unless you buy a digital to analog converter box. So, I got a digital converter box and use that remote to change the PIP. What a short sighted design flaw on an otherwise good tv.Also, Fios in my area of NJ has turned off analog now to make room for more HD, and is planning a major expansion of its HD channels soon. I have about 30 now (plus PPV and on demand) with promises of 150 HD channels by the end of the year. If you can get FIOS, I highly recommend it. The picture quality is amazing and the internet is super fast. Even the regular tvs look much much better.Remember the picture on any tv is only as good as its source.Samsung LN40A550 40-inch 1080p LCD HDTV", "Date": "June 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Samsung and Amazon.com Provided a Five Star Experience", "Author": "Larry Epstein", "ReviewID": "R2VVFIDGQF2RDI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used a variety of sources to determine which 40\" LCD Television would best meet our needs and our budget.  Prior to the research, I was focused on an adequately satisfying viewing experience in a very reliable television.  A previous purchase had not satisfied both goals.  I had bought a \"no-name\" product for which no local service was available.  When it failed (two years), I packaged and shipped the product to a repair facility where it was repaired well and with a reasonably short turnaround.  Still, I didn't want that grief again.Nor did I wish to gamble again on the offerings of the local Sam's Club shelves that appeared to be \"earlier versions\" in every case. I was going to indulge myself in a current model of a name brand television.Consumer Reports gave its highest 40\" LCD rating to the Samsung LN40A550, and the purchasers' ratings at Amazon.com and other Internet vendors were entirely positive.  My son-in-law's experience with high dollar electronics buys from Amazon.com was the clencher in my decision to spend a thousand plus dollars over the Net.  I'm glad I did.  My cost savings over any local source (Best Buy, Sears, etc.) exceeded $250.  My total cost with an HDMI cable was around $1140.Just as promised in all the reviews, the LN40A550 was quick and simple to set up.  The picture is razor sharp, and the colors are true to life.  There is little or no need to make color or contrast corrections from channel to channel. Some of the reviewers had bashed the A550's sound system.  I find it to be okay, but, if sound quality had been a very high priority, I heard sweeter sounds from a comparable (and pricier) Sony unit.I can't find enough superlatives to describe my satisfaction with Amazon.com on this purchase.  I paid no shipping or handling costs, and the TV was delivered to my living room in three days after my on-line order. The delivery was made by a well-groomed, articulate employee of a respected shipping firm.  That employee unboxed and unwrapped the TV and even offered to haul away the box and shipping materials.  I should have availed myself of that offer because Samsung currently is offering one year of in-home service on this model.My wife and I have satisfactorily dealt with Amazon.com many times on little items.  We have never been disappointed with their service.  We are extremely pleased with this recent major purchase.  I vouch that anyone who buys the Samsung LN40A550 from Amazon.com can look forward to an experience that is \"all good.\"Larry Epstein - Memphis,TN", "Date": "September 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good TV, Amazing Amazon Service", "Author": "J. Taylor", "ReviewID": "R1JA7MKCHHRL11", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A few weeks ago I happened to get a new Wii for my son.  Little did I know the saga that was about to ensue.  While I was waiting for the new Wii to ship, I noticed my old 19 inch standard definition Magnavox tube TV would not have the right connections for the Wii.  Realizing an opportunity had been presented to me, I quickly used the fact with my significant other as leverage to get a new HDTV for the entertainment/play room (we already have a older Samsung 30 inch CRT 1080i HDTV in the family room that we are happy with).  I was given a budget and told to have at it.Based on my prior good experience with the brand, I decided to focus on Samsungs.  The pictures on all the TVs I looked at were very good (at least in the store).  But since I am planning on getting a blu-ray when the prices come down, and I know I am the kind of person who will be bothered by the fact that I got the \"lesser\" resolution quality of the 720p (even if my eye could not tell the difference), I ruled out the 720p. That left my choice between the Samsung LN40A550 and the Samsung LN40A650.  I have to admit it, the Samsung A650 was a pretty good looking TV.  I also thought that the dejudder features and the 120hz would come in handy when I was watching sports and movies.  That having been said, when I looked at the TVs in the stores side by side, the difference in picture quality on the 40LNA550 and 40LNA650, while slightly noticeable on fast moving action movie sequences, was not worth the $250 to $300 premium (at least to me).Long story short, I got the LN40A550.  Here is my quick summary now that I have had the TV for a few weeks.AMAZON SERVICE -- Absolutely amazing.  The TV was delivered to my house 4 days after I ordered it.  A very courteous delivery driver brought the TV to our second floor entertainment room, unboxed it and placed it on our TV stand. The TV worked right out of the box.  The price has also dropped by at least $100 since I ordered it, and when I asked Amazon to be credited for the price drop, they credited my account within less than a day. I would absolutely not hesitate to order big items from Amazon in the future.THE TV -- Great picture (even on sporting events and DVD movies).  The sound on the built in speakers is ok, but not great.  I do notice a little bit of judder on fast moving panning sequences, but it does not really bother the flow of the scene I am watching.  For the price I paid, I am very, very happy with this TV.

NO dead pixels, NO banding, NO flashlight effect, NO problems. After owning a 30\" Samsung Dynaflat HDTV, I am more than happy to upgrade.

Best Buy, Circuit City and Fry's price was about $1599 to $1699.  There was no tax to pay and Amazon offered free white glove delivery.  What could be better than that.  It took about a week for the TV to arrive.  The freight company called to set up a delivery appointment.  They showed up, carried the box inside, installed the TV, did the basic set up (connect the HD antenna, the DVD player, scan the HD channels), asked me to inspect the TV and then I signed to accept the delivery. Can't get that kind of service with BB or CC.Now to the HDTV.  I use the default settings.  HD channels are crystal clear, it's a pleasure to watch the news and the Lakers games.  With a dynamic contrast ratio of 30000:1, the picture is bright.  I connect my up converting DVD player, pop in the movie CARS and my son couldn't take his eyes of the screen.

My decision to buy this TV from Amazon.com was influenced by these factors: Samsung brand, 2008 model, great price, no tax, and free white glove shipping.I have connected my TV to Comcast HD set-top box using HDMI cables. The picture quality on HD channels is stunning and very good on non-HD channels too. Initially I had some apprehensions that perhaps 40\" wasn't big enough, but after watching all those vivid, sharp images of people and things up close it doesn't feel small at all! Earlier I had used \"component\" cables for video connection but HDMI is clearly better. DVDs also look nice. For audio I have a premium audio home theater system (Bose) so I have turned the TV volume to OFF.My only complaint against this TV is with the extreme difficulty I had in taking off the stand that came with it. The screws at the back somehow got \"stuck\" and wouldn't come off readily. Samsung customer service representative on the phone didn't have any constructive advice to offer either. I had to tilt the TV, screw back and unscrew several times before the screws came off one by one. In such a high-tech TV they didn't get this simple mechanical thing right.

Bojo", "ReviewID": "R2GSP8XLL23BBK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this tv for about 2 weeks, i purchased the tv April 30 and got a call that they could deliver on the 7th of May which is a lot sooner than what amazon suggested which was the 13th but i would not be able to since i was going to be at work so i said how about next Wednesday the 14th and they said fine. The delivery service was amazing. The delivery period was between 8am and noon and it was here right before 10. They came inside took off their shoes and took it out of the box and brought it up stairs for me and set it up to make sure it worked and offered to take the box for me.Now to the actual tv, one word....AMAZING, i upgraded from a off brand 26 inch tube tv that sucked and had no inputs at all i could not even plug in a vcr or dvd player. I did quite a bit of research when i was ready to get a new tv, i went to Walmart, best buy, circuit city, Sam's club and ABT Electronics in Chicago Illinois. I did not want to spend much more then a 1000 on a tv and i wanted a 32 or 37 inch tv i was looking at a Vizio and a Toshiba and was pretty sure i was going to get a Toshiba from ABT since if i ever did have any problems they would just come out themselves and fix it. The tv would have been a little more then 1300 but my cousin told me he just bought a 52 inch Sony xb4 which is over 3000 dollars off of amazon and i decided i would check it out myself. I just typed in lcd tv and went through the tvs and finally came upon the Samsung ln37a550 and was pretty sure i was going to get it but then i saw the Samsung ln40a550 was only a hundred or so more i was like i have to get it. It has double the contrast ratio which you really can not focus on to much if your looking at different brands since there is no exact science to measuring the exact contrast ratio but it has a very quick response time of 5 seconds and when i saw the free shipping i busted out my credit card and purchased it. I could not be more pleased with my purchase. I bought a ps3 and hooked it up with a hdmi cable i got from monoprice.com for 10 bucks and that is another site and item i would really recommend to anyone DO NOT BUY EXPENSIVE CABLES. there is no visual difference between the 100 dollar and 5 dollar hdmi cable unless it is over 25 feet so don't waste your money. Call of Duty 4 is amazing on this 40 inch tv and so is blu ray movies.Some people have said the speakers on this tv suck but they really don't they are better than any other tv out there of course they aren't surround speakers so don't say the speakers suck because they aren't suppose to be same quality, but they are really good for just being the tv speakers. I am about to get a Denon receiver so i can hook up my 3.1 Boston acoustic surround sound system.I also hooked my tv to my computer through a dvi to a hdmi cable which i also bought on monoprice.com for 5 bucks for a 10 foot cable. The quality on the tv is so much better then on the lcd monitor i was using, but it stretches the screen, i think it is just my video card but i thought i would let you know.Overall i rate this tv the best i have seen. I researched for a tv for 3 full months and this tv is by far the best i have seen. If you do get this tv keep looking at Amazon because they do a 30 day price match if you find it cheaper or if their price lowers within the first 30 days they will give you back the difference i have already received over 50 dollars which is what i used to get my video game. Well i think i wrote enough so i will let you get back to buying this item because it is so worth it, trust me. BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!November 18, 2008Alright so i have had this tv for about 6 months and still to this day i love this tv, I have everything for this tv because this tv is amazing. I got a 3.1 Boston acoustics surround sound with a Denon receiver, i have playstation 3 hooked up through hdmi which is flawless when playing blu-ray. I have a mac mini hooked up to the tv and it is amazing to do stuff like photoshop and all that on this large tv. I also hood up a view sat satellite HD box with a dish and now i have over a 1000 channels and it is crystal clear. All this is mounted on a tv stand that i got at Wal-Mart and it looks perfect i will take a picture of everything and put it up soon as soon as i can find my digital camera.Well let me tell you about the performance of the tv, the tv is perfect in every way, i wish i got this tv a long time ago but oh well i have it now. About 2 months into getting the tv i heard crackling noises when i would turn off the tv after using it for awhile, i got scared because i spend all this money and i didn't want anything bad to happen to it but it went away after a week or so and i haven't heard it since. I wish the tv had more hdmi ports but luckily i have my receiver that has plenty that compensates for the lack on the tv. Dont hook up your tv to your computer through hdmi unless you have a good video card because it stretches it out so you cant see the edges of the screen but when i switched it to dvi it was perfect.

Siegrist", "ReviewID": "R36690KZ2PQDEC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a really nice TV, especially since right now the price is just over $1k.Pros: Great HD picture - this includes HD television stations (for me output from a digital HD cable box at 1080i through an HDMI cable) and Blu-Ray. Standard DVDs upconverted to 1080p then sent through HDMI look pretty darn good - some pixelation and color variations here and there, but mostly looking good (also depends on how new the DVD is - newer looks better). The picture is near perfect. That's all that needs to be said there. Set-up is fast, the TV is not that heavy, and the swivel stand is great. Menus are fairly straight forward, although in my opinion there are too many menu options - great if you are a perfectionist and really know what you are doing when it comes to fine-tuning the color. I think there a good amount of inputs. Nintendo Wii through component cables looks fine.Cons: Would be nice if there was a digital coax audio out - there is only an optical out, and it doesn't pump out 5.1 sound (i.e., you go from 7.1 or 5.1 to 2.1 if you run the sound through your TV to your audio system). Standard definition (non-HD) programming looks fairly bad. I bought a cable line power booster, set the HD cable box to output only 480i when on standard channels, set the sharpness to 0, and turned digital noise reduction off. This helped quite a bit, but it still is noticeably bad. There is a lot of pixelation, some channels are passable some are awful. That is my biggest complaint for this TV.Final note - viewing distance means a lot. I sit about 6-7 feet away, and can see pixelation. If I step back another 2 feet, the image is much better. So, if you sit 6 feet away, I would go for the 37\" instead.", "Date": "August 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "A very nice HDTV for the price", "Author": "T. W.

The television is great,but I have knocked off two stars due to delivery and warranty service problems.I have mixed feelings about the delivery by Ceva. Six days after placing my order,the Ceva dispatcher called to schedule delivery.  Unfortunately,the \"local\" (actually based in another county) Ceva only offers two options each week for deliveries,between 10am and 2pm on Monday or Wednesday. I had important client conference calls scheduled at 10:30a.m. on both those days and asked the dispatcher to put a note requesting delivery after Noon. She refused to do so. Ultimately I had to wait an additional week for delivery due to their limited options for delivery windows. While I understand and am used to delivery \"windows\",to only offer delivery during two timeframes a week does not give you many options. Once the driver called me to get directions,he was very flexible and in fact made the delivery on a Tuesday,which the dispatcher had insisted was not possible.After 5 weeks of enjoying my new LCD, suddenly it stopped working (had power,but no picture and no chimes). I went through all the trouble-shooting steps then called Samsung,who said they would schedule a service call.The Samsung rep also gave me the name and phone # of the designated repair facility and recommended I call them myself,which I did the following day.The earliest appt.they could give me for repair was more than a week away. We scheduled the repair for a Friday and I arranged to work from home that day.  At 11 am,the dispatcher called to tell me they were canceling the repair appt.because the part they suspected was the problem (power supply) had not arrived from Samsung. Even worse,they said that Samsung was backordered on those parts and could not provide an estimate of when more would be available!!!! She said she had a dozen other appts.to cancel that day for the same thing.So I waited another week. Finally I received a call from the repairman letting me know he was on the way to my house. No one had notified me in advance so I left work to meet him there. Once the repairman arrived,he repaired the tv (turns out it was the main board) quickly and efficiently.Overall summary:- GREAT television picture and beautiful set at an excellent price- Many have complained about the sound,but I adjusted the audio settings based on the recommendations at the AVSforum,which made a significant  improvement. Also sounds great running through my Sonos system and external speakers.- Scheduling inflexibility by Ceva and the Ceva dispatcher's attitude did not feel like \"white glove\"service to me. The attitude and professionalism of the deliveryman,once we were put in direct contact,was great- The local repair service was friendly,although communications could have been better.- Samsung's inability to communicate when they would have more power supplies available is unacceptable. From what the repair service said,it sounds as if they're having to replace a lot of power supplies on these tvs. However,since it turned out to be a completely different part that required replacement, the repair service should have kept our original appt. Their \"guessing\" delayed the repair by a week.- The fact that the main board failed after only a few weeks of use concerns me....-All that said,the tv repairman said the A550 is the model he is planning to buy.", "Date": "November 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Livid", "Author": "E.

While at the store, we saw noticeable difference between them. The LN-T4069F had smoother image transitions due to its higher frame rate and a nicer picture rendering.

I'm using it with an HD cable DVR and a Blu-Ray player. We also use it with our Play Station 2.  The picture has been great from all sources.  The sound quality is excellent.The delivery from Amazon was a little questionable.  When the TV was shipped Amazon sent me an email saying that I would be phoned by the shipper to schedule a delivery.  The shipper never contacted me.  When the scheduled delivery date passed I asked Amazon for the shipper's phone number.  Amazon did not have it (they did confirm that the shipper should call me at the phone number that Amazon had on file, they also confirmed the phone number).  So, I used the shipper's phone number from their web site.  Sure, enough they did not even have my phone number on file.  They said they had sent a post card to me, but I never received it.  Anyway, the shipper set a delivery date and told me that I would be called 1 hour before the delivery.  They never called me, but luckily my wife was home when they showed up. The end result was to delay the delivery by about a week.  The TV was fine when it arrived, just late.I also have a friend who bought a TV from Amazon and received it via the same shipping company and had a very similar experience.Update on 9/12/2011:  This TV died last week.  The problem appears very similar to the problems described by many other reviewers.  In my opinion, three years is too soon for a TV to die.  Fixing it appears to be very expensive. Also, I have to wonder if I do fix it, will the TV will just fail some other way in a few months.  I'm now considering just replacing the unit.  I will probably consider a different brand given the Samsung track record (I've had some reliability problems with a few other Samsung products in the last couple of years).", "Date": "May 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Not Impressed", "Author": "Wilcy Moore", "ReviewID": "R3FX2ZYF64GAGW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've had the TV for a month now, and I can honestly say that I'm not impressed with it.  Part of the problem is that my TV has one of the known Samsung defects - it switches itself on and off without my input.  That problem is actually getting worse in that it keeps doing it repeatedly (off on off on...) until I unplug it.  Sometimes I can watch for as much as 30 minutes before it starts this behavior, but I know it's coming.  Oh, and when it starts doing it, none of the buttons on the remote control work and none of the buttons on the TV work.  The only option is to unplug the TV.But that's not the only reason for my 1-star review (it's part of it).  I know electronics can be a hit or miss proposition, and all manufacturers will produce a defective unit now and then.  I get that.  Amazon will take the TV back because I called within 30 days, but I have to give Samsung the chance to fix it first.  They don't seem to be in a big rush in getting a repair person to my house, although that could be the fault of the local repair shop.  In any case, I wait...Beyond the defective unit I received, the TV itself is nothing special.  If it's your first HDTV, you'll likely be blown away by the improvement.  If you already own another HDTV, you may be underwhelmed.  Let's face it, the picture is supposed to be awesome and most HDTVs will deliver that much.  What I don't like about the TV is how it's made.  The casing is incredibly cheap plastic that actually looks nice, but it reflects every bit of ambient light in the room (shiny black - good luck getting finger prints off of it).  What good is a perfect picture when you can vividly see windows and lamps in the frame around the picture?  The TV is also flimsy!  You can actually affect the picture by putting light pressure on the casing with your finger, as I discovered while adjusting the TV on the wall mount.  Lightly touching it in the wrong way will cause a flicker.  I have a Panasonic plasma that is built like a tank compared to this model.The TV's sound is also pretty bad, but that's been mentioned in several reviews so it should come as no surprise.  If you're hooking up home theater surround sound, the sound is probably not going to be an issue.  For my purposes, this is a bedroom TV, so I just wanted to use the internal speaker.  That's probably not going to be an acceptable strategy (and I'm not an audiophile, by any means).Finally, and I may be wrong on this, but I can't find any way to hook up a \"video out\" device.  I use a DVD recorder to record television shows on my other TV by running an HDMI connection from the input source to the TV, and then running a \"video out\" connection from the TV to the DVD recorder.  This allows you to watch in high definition and record in whatever definition your recorder allows.  Theoretically, you can run it all through your home theater receiver and/or run your input to the DVD recorder first, but that simply doesn't work as well as a TV to Recorder connection (going through the recorder first basically means you lose the HD of the original broadcast).  To me, that's a shortcoming that does matter since I really didn't want to complicate this TV with a whole home theater setup.  This will also affect anyone still using a VCR who wishes to watch in HD and still have the option to record (in much lower definition).The variety of inputs is relatively robust, and this model does still include an S-video input on the side (note, the newer model Samsungs do not have S-video inputs).  Oh well, the TV doesn't work yet anyway, and I'm sort of hoping Samsung can't fix it so I can return it to Amazon and buy another Panasonic (no I don't work for Panasonic, either).Update:  Samsung finally got back to me about fixing my TV.  They said I qualified for in-home repair, which they would arrange.  Then the repair person called me and said that they don't do in-home repair, so I'd have to box up the TV and bring it in to their shop.  Since I was boxing it up anyway, I called Amazon and they said to ship it back for a replacement or refund.  I chose the refund because I plan to buy a better TV.  5 stars for Amazon, no stars for Samsung.", "Date": "May 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Lemon", "Author": "Matt and Mandy", "ReviewID": "RVRDXGK7B1BJ0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This product has a defect.

Being an engineer, I did my technical research, and for the 40-inch space limitation we have I determined that the Samsung 550 Series LCD TV was the best bang for the buck. I researched prices and Amazon had the best deal. I ordered this TV online, along with the Samsung Model 1500 BluRay DVD player, and both were delivered on schedule and in perfect condition.I bought the best Monster HDMI cables and did the hook ups myself. Initially, I was not impressed with the resolution and quality of the picture, but then I noticed that my cable box was only transmitting at resolutions less than 720. I called the local cable company (Bright House) and the customer service person walked me through a detailed set up so that the cable box and the TV were optimized. The menu screens are all easy to navigate and intuitive, and the process was not difficult with customer support.After this was done, the picture quality has been absolutely incredible, especially for those channels transmitting at 1080 resolution. Even for those channels transmitting at 720 resolution, the picture quality is stunning. Sharpness, color saturation, and color accuracy are all perfect in my eyes. For fast moving sports, I cannot notice any blurring. When playing BuRay DVDs, the picture quality is beyond awesome, so good that landscape scenes almost appear to be three dimensional. I have had people tell me that they are not all that impressed with HDTV, and I have to think that they have not taken the time to truly optimize their TV/cable system. HDTV is so good that I can no longer stand to look at regular TV.The sound quality of this TV has been a subject of criticism by other reviewers, but I think that it is more than adequate, and probably better than most flat screens in this size range. The Samsung 550 series TVs have an upgraded sound system over the lesser series that they call TruSurround, and with some BluRay DVDs it actually does have a quasi-surround sound quality. Since the speakers are small, there is not much bass or depth, but overall the sound is more than acceptable for a small room. I am probably going to add a speaker bar and a remote woofer at some point, but the stock sound system is just fine for now.Overall, I am completely satisfied with this product, and I my purchasing experience with Amazon was excellent.

Samsung is one of the top brands, and the only thing that worried me about this TV was the possibility that not being a 120hz machine would leave sports and action movies unwatchable.I found a website called tweaktv that offers picture calibration settings, and these made a huge difference on the picture quality out of the box. Changing the sharpness down to 2 and setting the mode to \"Movie\" make for a huge improvement in picture quality. Jaggy text went away, and the picture got a lot cleaner. I used the tv for a week without HD, because I didn't have time to go get the box. Picture quality was OK with regular cable and component cables. Better than the old regular tv it replaced, and dvds played with S-Video from a standard DVD player looked crisp and good.Today I finally got the HD box from my cable company, hooked up with HD cables. HD broadcasts are just stunning on this tv (keep in mind that when time you change input sources, the first time using that new source all the settings are back to the defaults. Each new input source will need the picture settings messed with the first time. HD looked pretty bad on the default settings until that sharpness got turned down)... Non HDTV channels look ok, but no better with the HDMI connection, and maybe slightly worse in a few cases.ANYHOW, heres the skinny. Loving this TV. The menu's all make sense and are easy to navigate. The remote is also intuitive and easy to use( it is NOT a universal remote, btw). Sound is pretty good. Connecting to it is easy, and all the connections are well labeled and easy to use. It looks good, and seems much bigger in my living room than in the showrooms. We see a lot less glare on the screen when the sun comes in the window as well.And, the thing that worried me- almost no problem with motion blurring. Sports and action movies are all very watchable on HD (somewhat less so on the regular cable). There is a slight amount of blurring during extremely fast action, but its not distracting at all.I was scared that this would be the dealbreaker, but like everything else on this tv, it exceeded my expectations.

You will find that the TV may be loud enough for everybody in your house to hear it through the walls, but everything you hear from it while sitting in front of it is muddled and difficult to hear and unfortunately raising the volume just makes the lack of clarity louder, it doesn't make it any clearer.I wholeheartedly recommend this tv to anybody who already plans on using it with an external receiver and speakers, because if you are able to get around the terrible sound (which you can with an AV receiver) then you will find that this tv is everything that you are looking for at this price.  Besides if given the option between a great display with sub-par audio and a mediocre display with great audio, I would take the better display because you can't get around a crappy display.", "Date": "July 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "turn on of all day if i dont unplug", "Author": "Mr. Laszlo Balogh", "ReviewID": "R1M7LLJ0814VQ2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This tv was good for about 1 1/2 years.Afer the red light started to blink each turn onfor about 20 times and the picture wanted to come on but shut off Started this sequence over and over..Now it would cost as much as a new lcd tv if I got it fixed.To have this problem all over the USA and Europe, Samsung is going to the bank with their profits is a rip off and criminal.They should recall all their known junk and step up in this bad economy and fix for free...........I was a samsung custumer,almost all of my electronics was SamsungDO you get it (WAS !!)Do they care ?

I shopped very carefully for this substantial purchase, and paid close attention to product specifications - especially HDMI CEC interconnectivity. The Amazon and Samsung websites note that these units are Anynet+ and HDMI CEC compliant. The Anynet+ demo on the Samsung site also illustrates the benefits of interconnectivity that I hoped to achieve. And on this product page the spec description states that the unit plays well with other electronics.Not so. When I installed these units today, however, I discovered that I could not control other AV equipment as I expected. Specifically my existing SONY DVDs. Browsing the AV forums, I see that sometimes cable quality is an issue (my maker claims HDMI 1.3 compatibility) while others see odd video or sound effects. In my case, I have picture and sound but cannot get my sets to recognize the device, even after ensuring HDMI CEC is active on the LCDs and even scanning the system for HDMI CEC connected devices.Now I see a very small footnote in the product manual that says that Samsung's branded HDMI CEC (Anynet+) is compatible only with Samsung equipment - which would seem to defeat the purpose of an industry standard for device connectivity. Duh! Look carefully for it: buried on page 61.If you are interested in device functional interconnectivity as I was, be forewarned that Samsung does not play nice with other brands where HDMI CEC compatibility is concerned. The negative reviews on Amazon of Sansung DVD players (poor quality and premature expiration) preclude buying a Samsung unit merely for the connectivity I hoped to achieve though what I believed was an HDMI CEC standard.", "Date": "February 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Did the research, read the reviews - this is a great TV.", "Author": "Matty Lip", "ReviewID": "R2K2FYKW44UK8U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When it comes to a big purchase like a new TV, I'm the type of person who likes to do lots of research to try and find the best product for the price.After deciding the size (40-42\") and style (LCD), it came time to figure out which brand and model would wind up in my home.

Incorrect as I now get stunning HD reception on channels that previously were unwatchable (compliments of PBS HD and CBS HD) for free with an old UHF antenna.  I call this set the natural enemy of the couch or a gamers best friend either way its hard to tear your eyes off the 1080p image.  Initially I tried out my 360 through the COMPONENT and SVGA connections available on this set, component cables showed ghosting compared to the VGA input, and HDMI proved to look the best.  Next up was the Wii and without a set of component cables this system looks a little blurry in its non HD display, but the widescreen makes the Wii and it's games more playable and appealing.  Finally I hooked up the PS3 with HDMI and, WOW this system looks and plays great on this TV, 1080p can tend to show jaggies sometimes but the resolution is overwhelmingly superior to anything I have experienced that I find myself playing better, and for longer lengths of time (particularly with FPS games).  I recommend a PS3 or Samsung upconverting DVD player for old DVDs, as the image particularly with animation and CG is vastly improved.  The weaknesses of this amazing monitor/TV are the somewhat weak 10 watt speakers (they still have decent seperation/depth but they are little puny for the size of the image), also the super glossy finish of the frame may bother those with very brightly lit living rooms or lots of interior lighting, but in my batcave I don't notice this at all. PIP on this set might as well not exist as it only shows non digital AIR channels and poorly at that.

I was initially hesitant to spend a large amount of money on such an important purchase. But with the lowest price anywhere on the TV, a Blu-ray player for less than half the list price, a $200 gift certificate for sports memorabilia and no taxes to pay, I saved over $700 compared to getting the same set-up a my local brick and mortar store.

The HD picture quality was very good right out of the box but with a few tweaks it is truly amazing.

The clarity and depth is outstanding and the range and intensity of the color is as good as any plasma I've seen.

But I would think that most of the customers would not want to go through the trouble of opening it up and repairing.But other than that, this TV is great and I really love watching movies.

After reading many, many reviews and making comparisons, I believe that we found the best HDTV on the market. We were looking for an HDTV that would provide reliability.I currently have a smaller Sony and ever since its purchase, I have been unhappy with the color and tones and no matter how much I tweaked it, I still cannot get it the way I want.  I thought that ordering HD service would help the Sony, but it is not any better than it was with standard service.Here are some pros and one con:PROS: Excellent picture even without a converter/cable box. We have HD service, but have not used a HD cable box with this TV--just standard service.Menu for tweaking is really easy to navigate and, of course, I tweaked away.View from any angle is really good--not blurry like other flat screens.Great for playing my Wii games.Color and clarity are really nice.CON:Manual could be a little easier to read.  I had trouble figuring out how to set up the Wii (I guess I am TV or manual stupid).Others have complained about the sound, but I must have a \"tin ear\" because the speakers sound fine to me.Overall, very pleased with the purchase.P.S.  Don't be surprised if you don't receive complete White Glove Service because our delivery driver brought the TV in, put in on the floor and \"beat his feet\" out the door before I could ask whether or not he was supposed to set the TV up.  It didn't really affect us because we took it right out of the box and hooked up cable. My sister ordered a size up from this one and her delivery people came in, set it up and made sure it was working before they left.

I did my homework and I wanted to find a decent HDTV that would provide reliability and functionality at under $1000. I was torn between this model and a Sony that was $999. I've always been a loyal Sony buyer and they have never let me down. They are expensive, but I figure you get what you pay for. Until I found out Samsung makes the MAC display screens. That changed my mind about Samsungs.So given the price I went ahead and jumped. I'm really happy with my decision. Overall this is a great value for the money. Here are some pros and cons I found, but the pros outweigh the cons:PROS: Excellent picture even with a regular cable box. I have Time Warner Cable, but I've been too lazy to exchange my regular cable box for an HDTV cable box. I can't really say I will either because I can still pick up channels that broadcast an HD signal, like HBO HD or basic's like TNT HD. They look great!! So I'm not really in any rush to upgrade just yet. Plenty of additional inputs/outputs. The factory settings out of the box need tweeking however, but once you mess with the settings, picture looks incredible. The size is PERFECT for a bedroom or a smaller living room. My living room is small, but the size was just right. I have my xbox 360 hooked up via HDMI - OMG - it looks AMAZING! Totally worth the cash to buy the additional cable. Also - the swivel stand it comes with is very convenient if you want to sit in different places away from the TV.CONS: Sound is horrible relatively speaking. It's okay if you really don't care about bass, but I have to be honest here...even after messing with the settings, the TV has the sound of a clock radio. Seriously. BUT - if you are like me and have your TV hooked up to a decent surround sound system, NO WORRIES. The TV's speakers are irrelevant. However, if you don't want to upgrade to surround sound, I would go with the more expensive SONY set. Sony's have better speakers.For the price - the TV is a value and a great starter LCD HDTV.I will probably upgrade in a few years, but for anyone wanting to go from a small TUBE TV to HDTV this is the TV for you.

CEVA installers arrived ahead of schedule and were very nice, set up TV correctly and quickly.  Out of the box, the picture was fantastic!  After adjustment with Video Essentials (highly recommended!), it was drop dead gorgeous.  Dialed in all my HD channels automatically and recognized the Sony Blu Ray and integrated into the remote w/no work by me.  But, that's not the best part...!Hooked up an old Mac mini I had hanging around by VGA (haven't gotten the DVI to HDMI cable and tried that... yet!).  Not only did the Mac (wonderful beast that it is) immediately adjust to 1920x1080, but the picture again, was beautiful and the letters on menus and the web browser are sharper than my 27\" monitor.  That and at 40\", it costed a lot less than a dedicated monitor and has a built in HD tuner.  So, highly recommended to those of you who want to integrate TV and the computer.  I have been watching videos off [....] since I got it and it's great!  Blu Ray like Iron Man are simply awe-inspiring.  I will never go to the movie theater again.Will probably buy another for downstairs PC monitor and another bigger one for my home theater room.  Oh, and for the skeptics in the crowd who follow all the blogs on these screens... I got a \"C\" type screen (made in Mexico) with firmware 1008.1 and yes, it is truly great, nothing at all wrong as others may suggest.  What I see in the blogs is that the color decoding in the firmware that was created for A and S screens did not work well with the C's and has now been corrected, probably as of version 1007.1 firmware.  Amazon ships very \"fresh\" TV's (mine was purchased 01/27/09 and was manufactured on 01/31/09!), so I would say it is very likely you will have just as good an experience from this perspective as I have.  Holds a deep black perfectly, no flashlight effect from the backlighting, perfect color tones with only minor adjustment of color and tint.Only negative is that the sound is very poorly adjusted out of the box. You need to adjust the lowest bass way up, mid-range down, and highs up a bit and then you will get a nice even frequency curve.This is the best deal in a 40\" LCD on the market now, and twice so thanks to its amazing performance as a PC monitor!  Hope you enjoy yours...!UPDATE: Got the DVI cable and WOW! Even better picture and, when selecting overscan ('JUST SCAN' on this TV), the picture now perfectly fills the screen.  Much better than my other flat screen dedicated monitors and CRT's.  Watching streaming video every night now, recommend a computer and this TV over a DVD player any day.

We didn't buy it at Amazon (a local chain had it for $800 with in-store pickup, so we just did that -- though the price now is equivalent of what we paid with tax), so I can't speak for delivery or anything, but the TV itself is fantastic.The next generation of sets will be out in June, so we wanted a set that could replace the busted rear-projector HDTV in our living room and then move to our bedroom when the new models come out in a few months. The Samsung A550 more than fits the bill. The picture quality is excellent -- especially after using the AVS Forums settings and we love the design of the casing. We've got it on a stand right now, but will be buying the Peerless PA740 Articulating Wall Mount for 22-Inch to 40-Inch Flat Panel Displays (Gloss Black) in a few weeks and mounting it on the wall. Even without mounting, the swivel and having it at a slight angle gives us perfect viewing throughout the living room.In a perfect world, the remote control could be configured to work with the receiver too -- but that's what the Logitech Harmony universal remote is for. We have HDTV, SD cable, an Apple TV and a standard DVD player attached right now -- but we'll be adding a Blu-Ray player next week. Unlike other commenters, I don't think the SD signal looks bad -- it just looks like SD TV. HD, of course, really shines. Play upconverted standard definition content through the Apple TV (running boxee) looks fantastic, and even on my older 5-disc DVD player, the the quality is really nice. Blacks are deep, etc. I can't wait to hook up the Samsung BD-P2500 1080p Blu-ray Disc Player and watch Netflix Instant-viewing in HD.The built-in sound isn't fantastic, but we hooked it up to our 7.1 system almost as soon as we got it. If you are going to use  it in a living room and you don't already have a surround system, look at investing in even a really inexpensive HTiB set-up, it'll be a big improvement. It interfaces perfectly with our Denon receiver, even though it was the model year BEFORE HDMI started becoming standard (the AVR-1905). The optical out pumps all the surround sound signal to the receiver and we don't miss anything.For the price and the size, you can't go wrong. When we bought ours at the store, it still had its original price tag from last summer, which was nearly double what we ended up paying.

Best moment yet - connecting my top shelf gaming pc up to this monitor and running Fallout 3 in all its glory: pure awesome.I paired this item with a Samsung bluray player (nice becuase the remotes cross over in functionality), for premium movie viewing. Upconverted DVDs look fantastic, and BluRay...  well, *even more* fantastic  lol.A couple point of contention:As noted by others, the speakers kind of blow. But who the hell would use this tv without a dedicated sound system??The factory default settings are aweful. Brightness was all blown out, blacks were way too black etc... Just get to know the picture settings (again - very intuitive and easy to use) and you too, will be able to coax tremendous image quality out of this awesome tv. (For best results, set Brightness to 30-40, which will produce a very pure black point.)If you have the extra cash (which I didn't), the 650 models have a faster refresh rate (120 hz) - which noticeably smooths the transition of high contrast elements across the screen.

Sure enough, this TV, in the 40 in and 46 inch sizes had the clearest, sharpest, brightest, most amazing picture quality I've ever seen.  I wondered if I should step up and pay another $500 for the \"red\" series TVs with supposedly better contrast ratios and refresh rates, etc. but wanting to keep my purchase price around $1200 or so I went with this TV and now I'm so glad I did!  This TV has plenty of contrast and speed and even the standard speakers on the TV excellent.  My TV arrived in 6 days from the time I placed my order with Amazon and it was carefully delivered to my home with a appt. set up by CEVA shipping.  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS TV!  The best I've seen at any price or size.  Just get it!  You won't be disappointed!  But if you really want to see what this TV can do you will want to also get a Blu-ray player and a copy of the BBS video Planet Earth.  Absolutely astounding!

Cook", "ReviewID": "RQB4VEH8X7A45", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the Samsung LN40A550 during Amazon's after Christmas sale, and after delivery and installation time is taken out of the equation, I've been using it for about two and a half weeks. My experience with this product has been almost entirely positive. Samsung's menus are intuitive and easy to navigate, a feature that seems to apply to all their products, and the remote, while large, does the job well and allows for alot of functionality without ever going near the tv.The tv's appearence is sleek, clean, minimal and modern, and it manages to be pleasing to the eye without taking over the room. As far as inputs and outputs, it seems to provide enough of the high end stuff (HDMIs, along with RGB and component videos) to let you plug all of your high def video sources in simultaneously. For those of you out there considering use as a computer monitor, as I was, I heartily recommend this unit. The VGA looks clean, and the Picture in Picture function allows you to watch tv in the corner (albeit only tv, not a video source) while checking your email or surfing the net.This unit also has a very pleasing picture. Full 1080p, the current best home theatre has to offer, and it shows when plugged into a high def signal. Colors and deep and true, whether watching movies or playing video games, and the refresh rate seems enough to keep up with you, making even fast moving images smooth.There is only one down side to the experience that I have had while purchasing this tv, but it is definately worth mentioning. The shipping company Amazon used to transport this product to me, CEVA, was extremely disappointing. Now, I'm a realist. I received free shipping, and I know that you get what you pay for. But come on, there should be a line between \"free\" and \"we should be paying you for this.\" When the purchase was made online, I entered my phone number so that CEVA could contact me when my tv was on their loading dock ready to ship. So, days go by, and one afternoon I receive a letter from CEVA, telling me that my tv is in their warehouse, and that I need to call to schedule delivery. When I called the next day, I learned they had been in possession of my tv for four days, but because they chose to mail me, I was just then hearing about it.Then, on delivery day, one installer shows up with my television. Now, I know that every company does things differently, but in my experience any tv 40\" or bigger needs two installers, even if just to help them balance the big ungainly box. Once inside, my friend instructed the installer to set the tv up on an entertainment shelf on the wall, about shoulder height. And the installer looks at her like she's asked him to install an irrigation system in our back yard or something. She leaves him alone, goes back in the kitchen, and about five minutes later he follows her in with a clip board. He informs her that his boss told him he should be done by now, and he would like her to sign, saying that she declined the install, so that he can go on to his next job. She refused, which gained her another irritated look, and he proceeded to go back out and finally place the tv on the shelf.In conclusion, an excellent product, and one that I would recommend to anyone looking for a very reasonably priced 1080p unit. However, I would strongly urge Amazon to reconsider CEVA as their shipping and installation choice.", "Date": "February 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Samsung LN40A550 LCD TV Review", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "R260CT578NKK01", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After looking around in a few of the big box stores, I was initially set on purchasing a Plasma flat panel TV, however, as soon as I saw this LCD TV, the clarity of picture was heads above anything else in it's price point.I am yet to upgrade to a Blu-Ray player although the HD content from my local cable provider (Comcast with HD box) is amazing. The NHL playoffs and seasonal baseball games look absolutely amazing. There is little to no noticeable picture blur, and the images are very sharp.Up-converted DVD's are a hit and miss scenario - IMHO, a lot of it depends on how good the original movie was shot, as some movies look great and other's only have a slight improvement.Some examples of one's that look good are \"Master & Commander\" and \"Star Wars 3 - Revenge Of The Sith\". Show's like \"Chappelle's Show or even something like \"Idiocracy\" look ok - still watchable, but just ok.Standard-def TV is the same as most regular DVD's - watchable, but no where near HDTV. I'm almost at the point where I don't watch regular-format TV anymore, if it's not in HD, I generally will not watch it - it's that much of a difference - especially MTV HD (mostly concerts on that channel and thankfully NOTHING like the regular MTV) and ESPN - Discovery HD is great, although History Channel is hit and miss - it seems to me that some of the shows are just upconverted and re-broadcast over the HDTV format.The TV has a very nice piano-finish bezel, that is really not noticeable in 99.9% of most regular-viewing scenarios and IMO, adds to the look of the TV. Everyone that has seen this TV in my place has commented on how nice it looks and how GREAT the picture is.The set was literally plug and play (I currently use it connected via the compnent cables which WILL run 1080i and there are upconverting DVD players available that run 1080p via component (web-search Kingwell), with all the colours looking great and the HD picture being very crisp and IMO, much better than anything else in it's range.Admittedly, it is a new TV (I've had it for about a month now), so I am not sure of the reliability, but time will tell. In any event, I highly recommend this TV for an \"out of the box\" great picture, without any of the hassles of Plasma.NOTE - the white glove service of Amazon was also great and the set arrived days before it's original ETA, which is always a nice surprise.Highly recommended.", "Date": "May 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV for the Price!!!!", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"lynsteve1\"", "ReviewID": "RF4Q1YR6YD86W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this TV delivered yesterday via the 'White Glove' service and have been amazed at the picture.

The setup of the connector ports are nice too; everything is easy to access and no need to read the instruction manual to setup. Just take it out of the box (the stand is already attached), plug it in and turn it on. The remote is nice too, but two main issues. I had to point it directly to the lower right corner of the TV to change channels. Also, the glossy plastic is a fingerprint magnet.The speakers aren't all that either. The speakers are on the bottom of the TV and also point down. The voices come out not natural (I think is because I am still waiting for my TV stand; right now the TV is on the floor so the sound is bouncing off hardwood)I will be getting speakers for it.What I definately notice on the A550 over my old Philips HD tv is the contrast ratio. The 30,000 to 1 contrast on the Samsung made a huge difference in Call of Duty 4. I can see dark corners much more clearer now. Oks, I said enough, just buy the TV, the only reason I didn't get the series 6 or 7 was that the cost for 120hz is not worth it.

LOVE SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS- BEST QUALITY!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2ZOE8SWA1V27Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I LOVE SAMSUNG products (actually bought this in 2007) and have replaced practically all of my expensive electronics with the SAMSUNG brand. Nearly 8years ago my no-name-brand 40 inch television from Fry's conked out...working when I went to bed and black screen forever when I woke up the next morning. I had gotten it when LCD flat screens were really just hitting the market in popularity but were still really expensive. It taught me as a young person the hard lesson that you sometimes get what you pay for if you want to be a cheapskate. So I saved up for a couple of months and during that time, I did extensive homework comparing brands, quality, longevity, pricing, etc. Everything I read about Samsung electronics and particularly about this brand television screamed HIGH QUALITY above all other brands. I found an on-line store...before that sold this particular Samsung I wanted at a lower cost than it was being offered retail anywhere.It automatically came with a 3-year warranty but I didn't need it. Once the 3 years hit I kept my fingers crossed thinking I was on borrowed time (most electronics these days conk out at about 2 years). I moved around with my beloved 40 inch SAMSUNG for years in California...it even lived for a bit perched high on the wall overlooking the living room of my CA apartment. SAMSUNG looked so serene and beautiful up there even when it was resting between delivering my entertainment. I often found myself staring at it in sheer admiration.More of late, I had a feeling it was getting worn out as most of us do when we get up in age...its little blue light was taking a bit longer to come on...but SAMSUNG'S wonderful warm chirping tone signaled it was ready and willing as always.Recently SAMSUNG took the longest move ever in my backseat to the great state of Texas(always in my backseat safely strapped in a box surrounded by protective blankets). I held my breath as I undid the box tape to help my SAMSUNG out....it so despises being boxed up. SAMSUNG cautiously came out of its cramped box, stretched its stand, took its place atop its matching Z-Line black and silver stand and commenced the duty at hand of airing my network programs splendidly with crystal clarity as always to my delight and amazement.Last night I heard a loud pop kind of like a soda bottle that was bent suddenly gets unbent. It caused me to look startlingly in SAMSUNG'S direction and my heart leapt with fear and concern. Yet SAMSUNG kept working perfectly so I dismissed the incident and went back to relaxing with my regularly scheduled programming. After all, my own joints tend to dole out loud pops as well. However, this morning SAMSUNG took a bit longer than usual for its blue light to come on but it did and SAMSUNG aired programming in all its multi-colored splendor. We left the house in the afternoon to run an errand and when we came back, we came back unfortunately to a black screen. No amount of coaxing could wake SAMSUNG up....It seemed that SAMSUNG'S chrystal flat screen remained cold to the touch and its eye dark forever more. My SAMSUNG had taken its final curtain and slipped away silently while I was absentia. SAMSUNG slipped away to the place all worn out televisions go...TV heaven. I am so very heavy hearted. I really needed an upgrade to the latest out there but after nearly 8 long years with me, I cannot begrudge my SAMSUNG LN-40A550 its due eternal rest. I am now in mourning and have begun to wear all black throughout this dark period.If I could give my loyal SAMSUNG a eulogy of 10 stars I would. I ADORE YOU AND SAY A LONG GOODBYE TO YOU. May you RIP my electronic buddy. It will be hard to replace you, but replace you eventually I must as my Z-line stand and my wall are so very barren. But rest in peace knowing that I, your beloved owner will ONLY replace you with a newer larger model of the same name...the SAMSUNG brand.

Amazon TV delivery is very well done, with complete in-home setup and a dead pixel check. I got some tips from the AVS Forum on color settings for my firmware version, and tweaked a little from there. Amazing picture.But, not even 2 years in, the screen began exhibiting image retention problems. Now, if I call up the cable guide grid for more than 20 seconds or so, then dismiss it, I can still see the Ghost of Grid. The brightly-colored menus in the PS3 Amazon VOD app are even worse. But at least that fades after a minute.On the permanent side, I have a blurry dark vertical line coming down the left side of the screen, around where the pillar box edge is. No matching line on the right side. Over there, I have an inch-wide band of blurry brightness running across and down the top-right corner. I have never moved or abused the panel. I don't watch an excessive amount of 4x3 material, and I've been very careful not to leave a static image from any PS3 game on screen (I don't have time for much PS3 gaming anyway). I have other LCD TVs and large LCD computer displays with zero problems. If there's a fix, I'd love to know what it is. I've tried displaying a slideshow of alternating 100% black, then 100% white images. No change.

You can google for calibration settings for this model from professionals and then set your TV to these settings and know you have a calibrated TV. You can also use any THX DVD movie you have and goto extra features for the THX calibration on video and sound (e.g. Monsters Inc DVD, Cars DVD, Pirate of Carribean DVD).*Channel Surfing speed: Some LCD tvs take forever to change the channel, not with this model. it is swift. not as fast on my SONY lcd, but fast enough such that you can switch channels without being frustrated at all.*Remote: Samsung has the best remote i have ever seen on a tv.

Def. invest in a soundbar or some simple home theater system if you take sound seriously.* Turning the TV on is a little slower than I would like. It needs about 3-5 seconds to fully turn on, and sometimes I'm not sure if i've activated it or not.* Remote must be pointed pretty darn straight at the IR port in order for it to process the signal.

Like all of you I read many reviews and do countless hours of research before I purchase something, especially something I have not seen with my own eyes, so I count on all of you. I'm hoping my review will help the inquisitive people out there on this product. I used to be a huge Sony fan, I mean huge!! I was at Best Buy one day several months ago a bought a Panasonic plasma. I was very excited it was a 46\" Vera, or whatever they are called. I hooked it up, put it on the wall and I was so disappointed with the picture. I took the TV back the next day. I was looking at Samsungs (LCD) and noticed the LN40a650. I was very impressed, but not with the price. I learned something new that day. I learned about 120Hz fresh. Little spendy for my blood, but fell in love with it. I decided to purchase it, but of course it was not in stock, but they found it at another store. I jumped in my truck and drove to it. When I got there I saw my TV in a box sitting under the 52\" version of mine. It was marked about $400 less then the other store. I had to get it. I got this TV home (LN52A650) hooked it up threw it on the wall and I was complete. My girlfriend purchased a blue ray that day. Sony BDP-300 which made picture jump out at me. I was so impressed and I'm pretty much an electronics geek. I was finally pleased. Anything I plugged into this TV I was happy. My point is Samsung rock. I would have to say better than Sony. Sony is good, but way over priced. For the person that is looking for a great TV grab the ln52a650 you will be pleased. Ok, Back to this TV. Its not 120 Hz refresh, but it does a great job. I am very pleased with it. This TV went right in my bedroom. I have to express the importance of going to Samsungs web site and updating the firmware right away. Be sure to follow the directions. There are currently two updates for this TV. 1005 and 1006. Grab a flash disk and get it done. I have read people having issues with things in the past models. Get the TV to date. It will work great. I just added a firmware update to my 650 made the film mode more realistic. This TV is just as good minus the 120 Hz refresh. If your looking for quality grab this TV if you're like me you will be very content. Oh by the way back to the blue ray. DO NOT get the 300 series go up to the 350 with the Sony its alot faster start up, you can hook it up to the internet for the firmware updates and it will put out in HD Audio.", "Date": "November 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "The most amazing investment in my entire life...", "Author": "Arvind Raghavan", "ReviewID": "RI6UBF2EARXTO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is simply an amazing piece of engineering.

I compared this with a few other TV sets that my friends had( all were 1080p, brands: Vizio and Sharp 42\" TVs) and only then did I really know why every one insists on Contrast ratio.. Man the black in this TV are so black and the picture quality is crystal clear. Sound, out of the box was definitely an issue, however, with a few adjustments (search google for \"best sound setting on Samsung LN40A550\" and you can find a few links that have images of their custom sound settings. Believe me, it makes a huuuuuuuuuuge difference and now I'm more than happy with my TV's sound quality)I went for the Verizon's FIOS TV for cable and the clarity of the channels is just out of this world.After seeing all these things, I just wonder how the higher models in Samsung would perform (one with 100000:1 contrast ratio).

The con is that the sound quality as noted in other reviews does lend to some concerns, however after a few days I have gotten used to the sound and is not that big of an issue to me.  The delivery of this HD tv was actually two days earlier than the date provided at the time of the order which was a big plus for us.  This was Another quality product and shopping experience for us with Amazon.In the event you may not have already surmised this I highly recommend both this Samsung HD tv as well as purchasing it from Amazon.", "Date": "October 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Value", "Author": "Bruce E.

They did what was necessary and I am completely satisfied with  the delivery.The TV operates great no real problems.  There seems to be a great variation in quality of signals coming in.  I am hooked up with HDMI.  HD channels are great but hard to watch SD after watching the HD.  SD is nothing to brag about.  My viewing distance is usually about 6 feet as I watch most of the time from my computer chair.  Sitting a couple feet farther away does help with the SD.  6 feet is fine for HD.  I was pleasantly surprised by a couple things.  The sound is much better than I thought it would be after reading all the negative reviews.  A tip to others, there are 5 settings for audio you can try.  They are Standard, Music, Movie,Speech and Custom.  Check those out to find which one sounds the best to you. Check \"Equalizer\" and you will see what the settings are for each. Use the best settings as a starting point and use the \"Custom\" setting to fine tune.  Worked for me.  Also I am surprised at the quality of the video from a sharp angle.  It is just as good as our 50 inch Plasma Panasonic.  Overall I am very satisfied with this TV, it works great with my new compact Samsung DVD player and also flawlessly with my JVC VHS player.

I did a lot of homework before purchasing this TV and it seemed that generally, Samsung's Series 5,6 and 7 HDTVs receive some of the best overall reviews.  Though I haven't been able to fully take advantage of all its features, particularly the 1080p mode, I have used the unit with Comcast HDTV cable and also hooked it up to my laptop.  I believe my HD channels come in at 1080i and the picture quality is great.  The picture from the laptop also is amazing.  I will be purchasing a Blu-ray player in the upcoming months to fully take advantage of the 1080p.Many of the reviews on this TV unit complain about the sound.  I'm a bit of sound system snob (for my car, PC, home theatre, etc) and these reviews and complaints about the sound on the LN40A550 are right... to a degree.  What people have to understand is that in order to have a full rich sound, speakers need size and depth, which HDTVs do not allow due to their thin sizes.  Bigger, deeper speakers (i.e. those found in old CRT units and external speakers) typically provide richer, fuller sounds.  Simply think of the difference when comparing the sound that comes from a laptop to the sound that comes out of desktop computers with external speakers.  When considering these facts, I'm actually pretty impressed by the sound this unit produces and don't believe the complaints are justified.  Furthermore, the unit provides multiple sound settings, and selecting the correct setting for what you are watching makes a significant difference.  But I will be adding a home theatre system to really take advantage of the HDTV experience.I am very satisfied with my purchase and hopefully, the product will be as reliable as everyone claims it to be, since I did not purchase the extended warranty.

I recently visited a friend who had a new Sony HDTV. While the picture on his set was very nice, I did notice that the blacks seem much deeper on the Samsung. It seems to me, that the colors, in general, are a bit richer on the Samsung than they are on the Sony.I have seen many comments complaining about the sound. If you're expecting a top rate sound experience you might be disappointed. However, the sound on this set is better than on the set I replaced. Compared to my friend's Sony, I didn't notice any appreciable difference in the sound. Of course, that might be my old ears not being able to tell the difference. If I feel the need for better sound, I'll purchase a sound system. I think most people who want the best sound experience do this anyway.This set apparently has a built in QAM tuner. Although I have not seen it specifically stated that it has this feature, the owners manual states that you can receive HD-digital channels without a set-top box. What that means is you can receive non-scrambled HD digital channels having only a regular (non-digital) cable subscription. The number of channels will vary from area to area. Some providers may scramble all HD-digital channels. If this is the case, this feature will not work. In my area, the local channels are not scrambled and can be viewed in HD.I was not aware of this fact when I purchased the set. I think others may also be surprised to learn this.

What I mean is when you switch from cable/satellite to dvd or game etc, you cannot turn off the need to pass through the option to select the built-in tuner.

I went to all the big box stores and hit all the review websites and what I kept hearing was that the only LCD TVs worth looking at are either Sony or Samsung. This one in particular kept getting rave reviews from all the reviewers and salespeople I talked with. Even a salesman who worked on commission said he would recommend this TV over some that were more expensive. The general consensus was that you have to get up close to two thousand dollars to get a TV better than this in this size.I've had this set for a few weeks now and have noticed several things. The picture is very clear, whatever source you select. I'm only running component video cables to it right now, but I'm anticipating that the picture will be even better once I get an HDMI cable on it. The menus are easy to use and easy to navigate, unlike many TVs I've owned. I've read reviews from a few folks who say that they don't like the little night light at the bottom of the frame, but if you dig into the menus a little, you can turn that on or off.My only big complaint about this TV, and it is a reasonable one, is the sound. First off, I'm not an audiophile. I can't tell the difference between extremely good speakers and only fairly good speakers without a lot of help from someone more knowledgeable. What I do know is that my little Philips CRT 25\" that I got for a few hundred bucks from Wal-mart had sound that blows this TV out of the water. I don't push this TV too hard, and have never turned the volume up more than 1/3 of its capacity. Even so, when you get high sections in a song or something, the speakers make a really weird sound that I haven't heard from anything but an extremely cheap boom box. It's really frustrating to have a great picture and have the sound be so weak.I would also caution you that there is only one composite video input on this set, and it's on the side. If you have an older DVD player or a VCR or even an older video game system that you want to hook up to this, you'll either have to switch a lot of cables manually, or invest in one of those switch boxes. There are plenty of component video and HDMI inputs, but not much for lower quality feeds.So my recommendation to you is that if you're going to invest in this TV, invest in some speakers as well. They don't have to be amazing, but just about anything you buy will be better than what this thing comes with. That said, this TV is easily the best picture quality you can get in this size and price range, especially with the prices offered by Amazon (the same set was going for fifteen hundred dollars at the big box stores, and thirteen fifty on sale).", "Date": "July 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very Good TV", "Author": "Book Lover \"booklynx\"", "ReviewID": "R1J4IPUIBLVDTS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been wanting a SAMSUNG HDTV for some time now and finally I got one - the LN40A550.It has one of the clearest pictures I have ever seen on a TV.

This TV is awesome and I love it.  It took me about 35min to set it up because I was selecting the wrong input for my cable box.  O.K. lets go over the pros and cons.Pros: Great picture, decent sound (They don't build these TVs for great sound, the OEM figures that most people will get surround sound) Tons of options for picture and sound adjustment, very slick and stylish look, 3 HDMI inputs, the buttons on the remote control have a back light so you can see them at night,  menu is very user friendly and easy to navigate, has a USB port for pictures and firmware update, PS3 & my Xbox look amazing!!!!!Cons: The only con I have is really not with the TV but with Time Warner.  Time Warner's standard cable signal is weak and most of their channels are broadcast in analog.  Everyone is telling me that Direct TV is all digital and they are better for HDTVs.  I'm really thinking about switching.Oh I forgot that I plugged in an old rabbit ear antenna that my girlfriend found in the closet and I was able to pick up about 13 HD channels over the air!!!!  What's really funny is the free HD channels over the air look better that Time Warner's HD channels.

Baseball looks great but I must admit, Basketball in HD is breath-taking.Comes with 3 HDMI ports so I will eventually buy a PS3 for the blu-ray experience.The casing itself is glossy black and comes with a neat blue light at the bottom of the Samsung.Also priced $400-500 cheaper than any big retail store, this is a deal.

Last week, one month after the warranty ran out, it started to turn itself off for a few seconds, randomly,  in the middle of a TV show or while playing a DVD. The screen goes black, but the audio stays on through our soundbar (which we had to purchase because the sound from the TV itself is practically unintelligible.) Samsung, apparently, is known for its terrible customer service and was true to its reputation, having no interest in a TV which is out of warranty. After doing some research online, we found hundreds (maybe thousands, literally) of complaints about this (and other) Samsung models, all of which have this exact problem that kicks in after a year or so. The consensus seems to be that the capacitors Samsung uses are known to go bad, but Samsung does not admit a problem. Our blackouts have been going on for a week or so, but from everything I've read, they will become longer and more frequent, until finally the TV won't go on at all. Some people have fixed their TVs with capacitors bought for a few dollars from Radio Shack, but this requires opening up the back and having soldering skills, not something I'm about to attempt. There's even a YouTube video on how to do it. Of further interest: there is a law firm that is currently investigating filing a class action lawsuit against Samsung, based on consumer complaints, and one can sign up on line. All this information is available by Googling \"Samsung blackout problems\".

You don't have to be an audiophile to notice the lack of bass and hollow feeling coming from the speakers.Dealing with CEVA for delivery had to be the most difficult part of my purchase. They never contacted me to arrange for delivery and I came home one day to find a notice on my door that they had attempted delivery and to call them. They would not deliver on the weekends and I had to arrange for a friend to meet them because I could not get home from work within their delivery hours. After enjoying my new TV for three days the thing just died. The status lights came on but no picture. After about 10 minutes of troubleshooting I called Samsung support. They seemed to know right away what the problem was and that it would require a service call. I had to call another company to arrange for service but the only appointment I could make was weeks away. At this point I had had enough and called amazon and told them I was returning it. On Sunday morning I decided I was not going to be denied another Sunday of football in HD so I drove to Best Buy, got them to match Circuit City's price which was about $130 more than amazon, put it in my car, drove home and set it up. The entire process took less than an hour. I then had to call CEVA and arrange for pick up of the dead TV; the earliest they could come was two weeks later on a Saturday and they could only tell me some time between 10am and 5pm. The Friday before they called to say they could not come on the weekend. I now have to take a day off from work to stay home and wait for them to come pick this up.I have purchased Samsung TVs and monitors before and have always had good luck with them so I was surprised by the dud that I got. But I did end up purchasing the same model and I am very happy with it. I would never again order something from amazon that requires delivery from CEVA.

With this in mind it makes it very difficult to give an accurate Review of this Samsung HD LCD TV.  I have cable service with the digital option that provides the HD channels. I also have a DVD player that is an older model and does not support the progressive scan technology.When viewing a HD program that is broadcast in 1080p the picture is acceptable and superior to my old analog Sony TV.  I say that with some reservations because the Sony was a really exceptional TV that provided 16 years of service.  Hopefully this new set will last as long.One of the things that I like about the flat screen TV is the weight.  A 40 inch LCD is around 50 lbs. This opens up many options for placement of the TV almost anywhere in a room.  Hang it on a wall or set it on a table or cabinet.The picture quality when viewing an HD program is very good, but that is one of the problems.  Not all broadcasts on the HD channels are high def and the ones that are...well they come in many different formats.  Some are 16X9, some are 720p,  some are 1080p and the rest are some form of 4X3.  I bought a 40 in TV to watch 40 inches of TV.  This is not always the case.  Although this is not the fault of Samsung it is frustrating. To compound this frustration Samsung has included picture size options to compensate for the different formats. This is fine if you don't mind things being out of proportion.  One note about the options for these new flat screen TV's.  They do provide a lot of options and one can adjust his set to his or her own specifications.  I have been an Electronics Technician for over 40 years and have been involved with maintaining CCTV systems for the most of those 40 years.  The point I'm trying to make is that most of this technology is not new to me, but I still have trouble setting up this new TV with all the options available.  I wonder how many individuals actually have their TV setup properly or even know the difference whether or not it is set up right. To make my point my wife just asked me how to adjust the picture so you can see the writing on the bottom of the screen.  This isn't the first time I've showed her how to make this adjustment.Audio.  Well I'm not particularly impressed with the sound.  If you go to some of the major retailers you will notice that they have all the volumes turned down and usually have an expensive sound system playing.  If you think about it, the flat screen TV's are only a few inches in depth with a small space at the bottom or on the sides.  This doesn't leave much room for quality speakers.  So think about investing in a quality AV sound system, 5.1 or better.Sports and fast action is another area where LCD TV lacking.  They don't respond fast enough to give a picture that isn't pixilated or blurred. Even with a 5ms refresh rate the performance is poor at best when viewing fast action.  I knew about this problem before my purchase but I thought that with 5ms refresh rate it would be minimal I was wrong.So where does this leave me in reviewing this Samsung TV.  I'm going to give it 3 stars. I'm basing this on poor sound quality,  difficulty in setting up the options on the TV and the poor fast action response.  All flat screen TV's have these same inequities.  Samsung is still the best as compared to the others.", "Date": "May 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Overall good stuff", "Author": "F.

Menu is relatively easy to use as well.of course i couldn't close without stating a minor \"negative\". when watching golf and they do a close-up of a rolling ball during a putt, i do get some \"tracking\" (if that's the right term) of the ball as it heads towards the hole. but that's it.so if you're perplexed as i was, be reassurred that purchasing this set from Amazon will be a good experience, and you should love your Samsung purchase.", "Date": "May 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV overall a great value", "Author": "C.

One day the problems just corrected themselves. Then four months ago, the TV developed other problems.

The bulging capacitor problem as fixed but the other problems continued. The high- pitch screeching sound when the TV comes on, the cycling off and on for ten minutes with and without various humming and screeching sounds. The series of screens with fine vertical lines running from top to bottom, some in green, some in white, and others in multiple colors. Two different TV repair technicians said the problem was the main digital board. They advised me to buy a new television since  the cost to repair the Samsung TV would not be worth it; I could purchase a new television for $500-600.The problems with this television are shared by many other purchasers, including some who posted reviews here. Even on the Samsung support site the problems with this particular model are outlined by numerous owners. Google Samsung LCD television problems and you will read hundreds of accounts of problems.

There is a very slight amount of light bleeding in the corners, but you can only see it on a completely black screen, and for that matter, the room has to be pretty dark too, but honestly, this is a miniscule problem that is corrected way better than I've seen before on other brand sets.The remote is easy enough to use, though I can't say that I used it much since I upgraded to a Harmony One soon after I got my TV.One thing that I didn't like about the set was how much dust shows up on the set. While you don't notice it so much on the screen itself, you notice it easily everywhere else. I tend to clean it up about once a week to keep it looking good.After 2 years, It's never broken down on me, and I expect it to continue working for a long while.

And like others have said, it started for us by just turning off once every few days and coming back up, then it got more frequent over a couple months, to a point where it wouldn't come up all the way again at all.. it would just cycle through restarting over, and over and over. Samsung support was good in expediting the fix to a local repair rep, but then we got put in a queue of about a week or more for them to get out and repair it. What's worse is it took them 5 (!) trips to our house to finally replace the right part that fully corrected it. So that means we lived without a normal functioning tv for nearly 2 months, said and done. Fortunately, we've been pretty much issue-free for about 10 months now, but it has shut off a couple times and has not seemed to continued. But we do live on the edge of our seats with this and the warranty is up, so knock on wood, we hope it's behind us. And although really do love the tv, I can't say I'd recommend taking the risk.

Absolutely spectacular picture on HD source, and much better on SD than I had expected.Amazon's free shipping provided a lot more service than I had anticipated. I expected the box to be dropped in my co-op's receiving room and that I'd have to do the rest. Instead, these guys made a delivery appointment, brought it up to my apartment, unpacked it, and got it going. They were polite and efficient. A lot more than I expected for free shipping. A major bricks-and-mortar retail chain wanted $300 more for the same t-v and $100 more to deliver it. Way to go Amazon.This is my first big-ticket purchase from Amazon and I can assure you they have won me over.

Delivery was no-hassle and on time.  TV looks good out of box after i did some tweaking (thanks AVS Forums!).  I got this deal when Amazon briefly lowered the price so it was a hell of a deal.I did a lot of research before buying a TV, and this one had great reviews on Cnet and various other sites.  One thing i found out later was that Samsung sends these reviewers panels that are made in the Samsung factory called \"S\" panels.  These are usually far superior to the panels that Samsung outsources to third parties, \"C\" and \"A\" panels.  Sadly I got a \"C\" panel, and it definaltey doesnt have the clarity of the \"S\" panel on display at Costco.  While I got a great deal on this TV, and the picture is still good and I'm happy with the purchase, I'll probably not buy another Samsung TV because of this issue.  Its basically a crapshoot on what kind of panel you'll get, and no way to tell until you take the TV out of the box.If you're on the fence about the LN40a550 vs. TV X i would go to Youtube and search \"S\" panel vs \"C\" panel and look at the demo that was created and you get the idea.", "Date": "April 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent Low Budget LCD", "Author": "C.

I especially like the pre-programmed picture settings for sports, movies, etc.  The settings seem to be endless.  You could customize the picture any way you want.  The remote is backlit, great for low light operation.I have not experienced any HDMI issues that other reviews have indicated.Many reviews have given the sound quality a poor rating.  I agree the audio could be a lot better, but using my audio system most of time the TV audio does not affect me.When changing channels that have different resolutions (ie. 720p to 1080i) the screen goes black for a few seconds.One problem that has bothered me since I hooked up the TV is the white light \"leak\" at the corners, which is only visible on dark scenes or when I use 4:3 to watch standard def programs.  For a company that has been making LCD's for a long time I wouldn't expect this type of problem.  My 26\" Maxent LCD that I have had for over 3 years never had this type of problem.

The ability to switch between different sources (air, cable etc) is very nice especially since we use both cable and a air for dtv. Stand is removable for easy wall installation and set fit a universal wall bracket perfectly (saved a bundle).Delivery took a bit longer than anticipated but went smoothly enough - no complaints. Brought into house and unpacked. Turned on then signed papers. Delivery driver even mentioned a quick tip to \"keep the box\" just in case it had to go back for any reason as they charge $25 for a replacement box.The only \"negative\" experienced so far is when trying to use a dvd player from EU - pictures shows only in b&w.; I understand there is supposedly some sort of work around but haven't had it long enough to find it yet. Fortunately, we own more than one dvd player but for those (such as myself) that enjoy watching foreign films or purchase/own dvd's from other country codes be forwarned this may not \"play nice\" with the equipment.So far so good.

The picture quality on it is great and the black quality is perfect. I have heard many people complain about the sound quality but honestly it doesn't bother me, at least, I don't notice anything bad about it. Obviously if you don't like it, you can always get surround sound. The picture is amazing even when just watching off the air channels with a digital antenna. But everyone HAS to get a bluray player and play blurays on this TV because it's breath taking. Just how clear everything looks would make anyone never want to watch a regular tube TV again.A few other things: the menu is easy to navigate, the TV is extremely easy to set up right out of the box, it only weighs about 55 pounds, great price for a great TV.The only thing I do not like about this TV is the remote. It just isn't sensitive enough so when I press the buttons I have to hold it directly in line with the TV or it doesn't recognize it. I guess I am just spoiled because my PS3 remote is bluetooth and doesn't need to be pointed at the device to be recognized.Overall, probably the best purchase I have ever made.", "Date": "February 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good product: No regrets", "Author": "DC \"Objective Reviewer\"", "ReviewID": "R9P5ETQ9YDEDC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "PROS:I bought this from Amazon and it was delivered within 5 business days.  The price was $949.99 with free shipping and no tax. Hard to beat that price and the product carries good value for this price.  The setup was very straightforward and simple from removing from the box to watching TV shows.  The menu setup is fairly simple with or without reading the instructions.  The digital tuner works much better than the converter box I was using with my analog TV.  The colors are bright and the picture definition is very clear. The finish definitely does not reflect bright sunlight or lamps within the room. I have to shut the blinds in the room in the afternoon with my old analog TV but it was not necessary with the new LCD TV.CONS:The speakers are on the bottom and face downward. The sound definitely is not as clear and full with these speakers. You will have to turn the volume up higher just to hear everything clearly. And it does sound a bit \"tinny\" as others have noted. The artifacting is noticeable in fast panning scenes and sports. It is not bad enough to annoy me, but is noticeable. I do not know how this compares with the higher level Samsung models or other brands. One last thing, I  felt the remote was not laid out in the most efficient manner, but I am just extremely picky. The various buttons that you would most frequently use are spread out a bit instead of clustered together in the middle.  This is not a big issue, just personal preference.Overall, I would recommend this product which is a great value for the performance to price (at $949.99).  For those who want perfect performance in all areas, consider another model with better built-in speakers unless you will connect to a sound system.  Also, the artifacting will bother purists and sports fanatics.", "Date": "February 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "best deal in town!", "Author": "I.

Nice!It's perfect. No dead pixels, DVDs practically look like Blu-ray already on this set, and I haven't even watched any HD video yet. The VGA/audio cord I've been using to hook up an XBOX 360 to a 22\" LCD monitor plugs right into this and delivers a flawless 1080p picture.****NOTE TO XBOX360 USERS - you will need an adapter for the VGA cord's audio plugs to go into the single audio port for 'PC' sound, or plug them into your stereo/surround system. Don't worry - the headphone jack sounds as good as everything else.Standard definition looks about as good as it can on a 40 inch screen. In fact, some channels have started broadcasting select SD shows in widescreen, and those look remarkably nicer too (since it doesn't have to deform the image to display it in 16:9 aspect ratio). The remote also has a single button for switching between 4:3 and 16:9, so that's handy. I've heard people complain about the remote and/or menus, but I don't see a problem. It's all pretty easy.The audio quality is fine. You're not gonna have a problem with it unless you're an audio enthusiast or just used to having surround sound. Although I did find that it sounds much better if you turn on the \"SRS Tru Surround XT\" option. It makes the default speakers sound richer.If you're comparing this to the higher end models, don't. All you're deciding is whether or not you want to pay for extra functions and fancy touches you don't need. This is the set you want if you're looking for perfect 1080p picture.

I also bought an Xbox 360 Elite from Amazon Warehouse, which worked great, and was flawless inside of the slightly creased box.  This purchase, on the other hand, actually had a tiny amount of damage.  When it arrived, there was a tiny crack in the oval-shaped plastic base of the television, and the volume up button on the side was pushed in on one of the corners.  I'm impatient as hell when it comes to shipping/receiving, and the comparatively slight damage was only aesthetic in effect, so I kept the unit anyway.Aside from its less than perfect entrance, this television is amazing!  I've got a friend that has the same size television from a different company, and mine blows it away in terms of clarity, contrast, brightness, and overall quality.  I've got several game systems, and now have them all hooked up simultaneously, which has encouraged me to play them more often.  I also use this as an external monitor for my MacBook Pro, which definitely makes those work-from-home days all the more enjoyable--I tried this on a 46\" Samsung, and it was simply too big to comfortably sit in front of and work with.  The 40\" is definitely the best for my needs, and the television was totally worth its cost.Along with having arrived in a quasi-damaged state, I deducted one star because the speakers are kind of muffled-sounding.  Granted, the speakers are on the bottom of the unit and thus the soundwaves have to bounce off of the desk/tv stand/etc before they make it to your ears, but they sound somewhat muffled all the same.  However, if you crank them up, it's all good, and they can definitely get super loud--though you audiophiles out there may want to consider some sort of accompanying sound system in the future.", "Date": "January 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "outstanding product", "Author": "E.

The digital tuner is much better than the converter boxes we had been using.  It tunes in channels we never received before.  The only drawback so far is that it is difficult to enter channels when you are using an antenna rotor.  The digital channels can only be entered by auto scan; when you rotate the antenna to point to other transmitters and rescan, it wipes out the channels you had entered by the previous auto scan.

I can't imagine ever running out of inputs, which is a concern I've had with every other television set I've ever owned. The picture quality is fantastic. It doesn't support 120Hz, but after watching it for a week, I don't mind at all. The sound quality is also exceptional, with very little tweaking.

The TV is easily programmable and I really like the customizable input labels.Picture Quality and Settings: The LN40A550 has a spectacular picture! I have my HD cable box, Xbox 360, and DVD-1080P8 connected to the 3 HDMI ports and the TV recognizes the signals very quickly. The audio setup was simple for outputting to a 5.1 system through optical - turn off the TV speaker and voila. The LN40A550 also has a ton of setup options, but I really didn't have to do much adjusting because the picture looked almost perfect out of the box. There are several settings for sports, cinema, and game that make viewing more enjoyable, also.Overall, I give this Samsung 40\" LCD HDTV 5 stars.

The anti-glare surface means ambient light doesn't really affect the picture at all (although it can be distracting when reflecting off the shiny frame).  Easy solution - close the curtains.  Not only are the colors rich and sharp, but the blacks are true, deep blacks.  Setup was a breeze, and it has really more inputs that I will ever use.  The remote and on-screen menus are very easy to navigate, and everything is fairly intuitive.  I've only had to go to the manual once to fix a setup option I screwed up the first time around.My complaints are very minor and don't really detract from my enjoyment of the tv.  1) The sound is very mediocre.  My living room is small, so I have to sit relatively close.  From about 6 feet away, it seems as though the sound is pointed directly down or back and I'm hearing it reflected off either the tv stand or the back wall.  It's just kind of stifled and tinny.  For some reason, this problem seems to lessen as I get further away from the tv.  It doesn't really matter as I have a surround sound system on order anyway.  2) The remote is kind of cranky.  It will not work unless it's pointed directly at the center of the tv.  After years of operating on the magical tivo remote, this one feels like target practice...gets a little frustrating.

I followed that up with another couple of weeks of research online into the models I was considering.  After looking at the feature sets on various models, I decided to go with the LN40A550 and ordered one from Amazon.  The delivery service was polite and fast and they were willing to work around my schedule to arrange a drop off time.The television itself is pretty awesome, overall.  The picture quality, from my unprofessional perspective, is at least on par with a large number of the plasma sets I looked at.  The blacks are as black as I've seen on an LCD and there is no perceptible motion blur.  The matte surface is excellent at handling the glare from windows opposite the telivision, which has been a blessing for me as I cannot rearrange the room.  I will agree with some of the other reviewers, though, that the sound quality from this television leaves MUCH to be desired.  The speakers aren't too bad, actually, but they are aimed downward and this causes significant muffling of the sound.  I'm lucky enough to have also purchased a set of speakers and an audio/video receiver, allowing me to avoid using the television's speakers entirely.I am a pretty avid gamer and this screen is excellent for gaming.  In game mode there is no perceptible input lag and almost no motion blur at all (some can be detected on occasion but still much better than my older LCD television).  I do wish that the different modes didn't gray out most of the configuration options, though.  Game mode is required to reduce input lag but the lack of tweaking that can be done to the picture in this mode is irritating.  It gives one the option of either enjoying no input lag and putting up with oversaturated colors or putting up with input lag in order to gain control over the color settings.All in all this is an excellent television and I would purchase it again.

The TV died so we found ourselves in the market for another LCD.After too many hours of online research i narrowed it down to the Samsung A550 and the A650.  We also looked at the Comparable Sony Line as well as the Sharp LCD's. Needless to say i decided on the A550.  After looking at both products in a showroom the A650 looked marginally better but not 200+ dollars better.When reviewing this product i am going to take price into account.  For the price i do not think their is a better value out their.  (That is coming from a biased owner)1.  Picture Quality and InputsThe picture quality is fantastic.  I have tested action Movies, Upconverted DVD's, Blu Ray and Sports (Preseason HD Football)  Their is no noticable motion blur.  The images are crisp and clear.  It offers 3HDMI inputs which is plenty (Cable box, Blu Ray, Video Games) and even has a USB port for Photo viewing (interface is simple and you can add music to the background while you watch your slide show).2.  SoundEh.  Not so great.  Tried it for a few minutes just to check it out and all i can say is not so good.  (Sound was not a factor in my decision making we own a very nice home theater set up.  It's hallow, and doesn't hold up when you raise the volume past 50%.  My personal feeling is you are never going to get good sound from any Flat screen because their is no depth to the speaker.  Small Speakers = Small Sound it's one area where smaller has not meant any better quality.(In my opinion).Generally people should consider investing part of their LCD budget on sound. You get a much more balanced set up.  Speakers in an old CRT tend to be better than those found in an LCD.OverallExcellent product by Samsung.

Samsung had also been recommended to me by a Directv installer, based on the hundreds of sets that he had seen setting up Directv systems.  My other HD set is an Olevia HD, with which I am very happy.  However, this Samsung gives it a strong run for its money.  I am very pleased with both. The Samsung picture is incredibly good.

This is fine since I hooked it up to a surround sound system and used that.  It worked fine for about a week and then one day I can home, turned it on and there was no picture.  I had sound, but absolutely no picture.  I couldn't even get the menu or sound volume to come up.  I called Samsung and they told me that they would send someone out to my house to repair it.  As it turns out, they won't actually send someone to the house.  I have to drive 40 miles to bring it to the repair shop, which is where the tv is now.UPDATE:It took about a month before I finally got the tv back.  It was very annoying to have to drive to and from the repair shop that was so far away.  Apparently there was a catastrophic failure of the power supply, mother board, and LCD screen.  In fact, they had to replace so many of the parts, the repair person told me that I'm basically getting a new tv.  Since I had the tv fixed, it has worked well for the past few months.  The picture quality is good (even though the sound still stinks).  In all, I am satisfied with the tv itself.  As for quality, I will give Samsung the benefit of the doubt.  Maybe I just got unlucky (which is basically what the repair people told me).  I asked the guys at the repair shop which tv's they see the least, and they said Samsung and Sony.  What I found completely unacceptable was Samsung's lack of customer service.  I feel as though I was lied to when on the phone with the Samsung help center.  The tv repair people also blamed Samsung for the long repair time.  They said that Samsung questioned whether so many parts actually failed (which caused a red tape delay) and then was very slow in mailing out the parts to the shop.

Stein", "ReviewID": "R1CTT7AN1I276W", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My parents bought the Samsung LN40A550, which has good reviews in consumer reports.  This TV has only 1 tuner, so picture in picture (PIP) requires another source. In the manual it does states: You can view Analog TV broadcasts on the PIP screen (sub-picture) when the main picture is from an external device connected to HDMI 1,HDMI/DVI 2, HDMI 3, Component1, 2 or PC.So if you are expecting to use an external device, which is composite video (the yellow video RCA jack on a VCR) to supply a 2nd TV tuner source you will still not be able to do picture in picture.When I got my Samsung 50\" DLP years ago it had dual tuners and PIP was a simple PIP button on the remote.  However the current Samsung LCD and DLPs along with many other tvs appear to have this limiting ability to perform PIP.  Even if you do have the required source (componet/HDMI/PC) the process to active the PIP is not just a PIP button click on the remote.

In the August 2008 CONSUMER REPORT, this model (Model 550) received top ratings for overall performance and superb picture quality.  With the enticement of the CONSUMER REPORT review; the ability to pay the unit off over three years, No Interest; and being able to watch the Olympics on a 40\" screen, I was hooked.I rated this product with only 4 stars primarily due to the financing promotion because I wish to point out that the 36 (or 24 or 12 month) promotion payment plan is not what it appears.  I presumed that the final cost of the unit would be divided into 36 equal payments over the designated period.  When I received my first statement I found that logic to be false.  The Amazon.com Store Card is issued by GE Money.  They bill in the following manner:  1/24th of the open balance as a minimum payment each month.  That means that for whatever promotional time frame you sign up, THERE WILL BE NO EQUAL PAYMENTS! You will be paying much more in the first year of ownership than an equal payment would have cost.  Also be aware:  After 36 months of minimum payments (or 24 or 12), as a result of this calculation method, you will NOT have paid off the television.  I did an Excel spreadsheet and found that after 36 months I still owe $237 for the HDTV.  That means if you don't pay it off totally in the 36th payment, all of the hefty finance charges will be added to your 37th month statement!  The 1/24th method of calculation was NOT explained when I signed up for the credit card.  Regardless, I still think that the deal is great....but the payment structure should have been explained.Inasmuch as this is my first HDTV. I was delighted to find that it was a superb purchase decision. I agree with most of the Amazon reviews regarding the unit. Especially the fact that at a louder volume, the 10 watt speakers tend to vibrate and give a high pitched sound.  You should consider a surround system so that you truly get the best out of this television.  (My next purchase).  DVD's are awesome!  And at this size screen, even letterbox looks great.  I also like the inclusion of a USB port for the use of showing digital photographs right off the camera.  I have always been impressed with Samsung products and this HDTV is no exception.  I compared the 40\" size at some retail stores with units from other manufacturers and found there was no comparison in quality of picture.If you want the best LCD HDTV viewing, buy Samsung.  I should mention that I live in the Chicagoland area and receive my picture signal through a regular airwaves antenna.  The High Def signals are unbelievable.

I upgraded from a 27\" crt model and the difference just knocks you out. On recommendation of a friend I watched some Discovery Channel HD programming. All I can say is \"WOW!\"Everyone else has pretty much said what needs to be said, but I do have one comment. I saw a review where someone mentioned getting an $11 HDMI cable.Folks, if you are going to spend this kind of money on a TV, why be cheap with the cable? Go ahead and spend a little extra to get the 10g monster cable. You wouldn't buy a new porsche and put a honda civic transmission in. Would you?The only negative I have about this purchase is the white glove delivery service. The tracking info had my TV scheduled for June 11 delivery. I expected to get a call on June 10 to schedule a time. Instead, the TV showed up unannounced on the 10th. It was just lucky someone was home at the time. And then the guys just plopped the box down in the livinging room and left. No unpacking, no taking the garbage away.I of course called Amazon. The first person I talked to about it thanked me for telling them, but made no offer of a rebate. I didn't pursue the matter with her because I wanted to wait until I got the tv unpacked and set up, so I would know if there were any problems. My next call was made that night and I was told I'd have to call back during the day. That surprised me, I had never run into that with Amazon before.Finally I talked to a guy the next day who at first didn't seem to understand why I was dissatisfied. I told him that the white glove delivery is supposed to be part of the service. He told me I should keep the box for at least 30 days in case there was a problem. I tried to tell him that if the delivery service did their job correctly I wouldn't have the box anyway. That logic seemed to escape him.But he did pass the report on to someone else and a couple days later I got an email telling me I had a $30 credit.I'm not sure I feel totally recompensed for my trouble, but it was something.So the moral is.

We were really excited to get an LCD that had great reviews, even though it was a couple of inches smaller. After all, we had read that Samsung is the best.While we did not have the HDMI issue that many write about, the sound quality on this TV was absolutely horrific. For a TV that many raved about the picture, the sound quality was far less than our 3 year old plasma that had just broken. I realize many people don't buy an LCD for the sound quality (and we do have external speakers), but you should be able to stomach the sound on your TV.The biggest, most glaring issue with this TV was the picture setting. You have four options total, which should be plenty. But I always like watching the full screen viewing, regardless of it being HD or regular TV. There is no way to stretch regular TV to be full screen unless you want to use the \"zoom\" mode, which cuts off a good portion of the top and bottom of the picture. It was dismayed to find this basic feature missing from this TV.After two days, this TV went back in the box and was returned, not because of a defect, but because the sound quality and picture options were not thought through. I am shocked at all of the great reviews on this TV. There are simply better options. We found a 46\" Sony Bravia LCD (120 hz) for $50 more and are thrilled.", "Date": "January 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Picture-in-picture (PIP) is not fully supported", "Author": "Dave \"Digital Media Guru\"", "ReviewID": "R1305CD54H7Z1W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Picture-in-picture (PIP) is not fully supported.

At first, I thought it was part of some \"cool design feature\", but after taking a closer look, I realized that this was caused by an improperly sealed trim at the bottom edge of the set that was allowing light to escape through. Naturally I was disappointed because this was my first HDTV. I ended up returning the TV for a refund because I didn't want to take a chance on an exchange having the same problem.

Arthur", "ReviewID": "R1MSRWRB9EDPK5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Here is the summary:1.  Amazon delivery service was awesome!2.  Samsung makes probably some of the best LCD HDTVs you can buy, but...3.  If you are coming from a CRT EDTV or HDTV, you will be dissappointed.  LCD TVs don't have near the color accuracy of CRT (the best), or even plasma TV (very good).  No matter how much time you spend calibrating the color with signals, and test disks, and test images from computer, etc, etc, you will at best get a picture that has about 30-50% correct color and the rest will be a slightly \"off\" hue which will forever distract your mind in trying to figure out, but it won't quite be able to.I compared by watching the same content on this TV after I calibrated it as well as possible (Samsung has some very good controls for calibrating the TV unlike other brands), with a 2 year old Panasonic Plasma (720p) and the plasma blew the color accuracy doors off this LCD.  Nothing I could do to make the LCD even close.The plasma has a true \"3-D\" look to the image, they look life like.  The LCD images just look flat, and ink blotchy.  Despite all my calibration, once in a while an image will come on the LCD which shows some signs of color banding.... just terrible.Unfortunately no one makes a plasma TV smaller than 42\" so I had to choose this LCD.", "Date": "March 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Pure Cap", "Author": "L.
