{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent High Value LG Smart HDTV!!", "Author": "Marty Gillis", "ReviewID": "R3V7D8DBECNNZ2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The LG 47LM 6200 LED edge lit LCD HDTV is perhaps the best current value on the market today!  With a razor sharp crystal clear picture, the absolute BEST 3D passive system available and wireless connectivity coupled with web browsing and limitless apps and 3rd party video content providers, you just can't beat it!I find a 47 inch HDTV to have the SHARPEST picture obtainable. The larger the screen, the farther apart the pixels are placed and the less cohesive the image becomes.  Unless you plan to sit 10 ft or so away from your television I honestly think a 55 inch screen doesn't provide the best picture quality. Perhaps when OLED displays with 4k tech become the norm that will change. But for now, all 3 of my LG flat panels are 47 inch and for a good reason.Let's start with the picture quality.  The video 'engine' inside provides you with a beautiful 1080p rendering from any source component. Whether it is your HD DVR , your Blu Ray Player, or your Standard DVD or even VHS machine, the LG 6200 will up-convert your video signal and present you with the best possible rendering.  The color decoders LG provides are top notch. With just a small amount of user calibration you can dial in near perfect color rendering and with the correct  backlight/contrast/brightness settings you can obtain previously unheard of contrast ratios that look GREAT in any amount of light.Don't even get me started on passive 3D. For me, it is the only way to watch 3D. No eye strain, no heavy expensive glasses and a fully enveloping, crystal clear viewing experience.  And LG has passive 3D down to a science. It is the very best I have seen. Period! (the 6 pairs of included 3D glasses don't hurt one little bit either!)I can honestly say that a television with this picture quality and feature set would have cost 10 thousand dollars or more just 6 years ago, had it been available then. Build quality, by the way, is excellent. There is nothing cheap or flimsy about this TV in any way. From the HDMI connectors to the included stand it is quality all the way.  Just about the only thing I can possibly complain about is the power cable which is attached, but my higher priced LG 7600 also has that little niggle.  (in fact, MOST TV's do)The included web browser and user apps, coupled with the vast array of premium content, You Tube accessibility and more makes this an 'All in One' entertainment center. Use the included magic remote in the same way you would a Wii game controller. The cool factor is high with this LG!  Don't forget about wireless connectivity to your internet router. (Look Ma, no wires) Really, it is amazing what you get for your money with this 6200.I recently purchased their new 7600 which is 2 models up from this one. The only major difference is a slightly different bezel and cabinet styling, plus the 6200 gives you a 120hz refresh rate, verse the 240hz rate of my 7600. Nine times out of ten the average person simply can not SEE the difference between those two refresh rats and let's face it, a 120hz rate is TWICE AS GOOD  in that critical department as our old school CRT tube televisions were.  The visual quality of the edge lit back-lighting is spectacular and in my opinion LG has edge lit LED TV's nailed!  My 7600 has quasi local dimming that LG calls 'LED Plus', but honestly in almost every real world situation it is NOT a necessary thing to get excellent performance out of an edge lit set.  And believe me, this 6200 gives you TOP edge lit performance, of that there can be no doubt at all.  If you can afford to spend another 2 thousand dollars on a full array local dimming LED TV then by all means do so, but if you are looking for the best value and picture in a very thin edge lit HDTV, then LG is simply the best in that department bar none!I was just watching a PAL Columbo DVD (an old 1971 episode) and was thinking to myself about how great this TV can handle standard DVD resolution.  A good trick is to engage the Mpeg Noise reduction to the \"LOW\" setting (found in the Picture options sub menu) and make sure your super resolution is turned on. I have been able to get near HD results from standard DVD'd doing this.  Great digital tool box in this TV and at no extra charge!  I am a huge LG supporter. This is the 3rd LG LED 47  inch TV in 2 years.  I have been impressed since day one with both the picture quality, amount of features and mature well thought out software implementation provided.  The functionality and maturity of the software control systems are a MAJOR plus with LG. This is not a Beta tester product. Everything has been well thought out and executed to give you the highest quality performance.  Things work the way they should, due largely to extensive research and development and TESTING on LG's part BEFORE they ship their products to you.Bottom line: This LG looks, sounds and works the way you WANT it to!At the current price, the LG 47LM6200 represents one of the very top values in HDTV today. Read my caveats at the very end of this review, but otherwise you just can't beat this TV for the price.  IT currently resides in the master bedroom , connected to a Fios HD DVR and Oppo Blu Ray player but could easily be the center of ANY living room entertainment center or home theater set-up. I truly believe it smokes the competition and as such I recommend it very highly!*** Check customer images for a few PICS I uploaded showing how this TV looks in the 'real world' !In the interest of full disclosure and fair play I am going to include a small list of shortcomings that befall ALL edge lit HDTV's. This is the same thing I posted at the end of my LG 7600 review and it is also applicable to THIS model.PLEASE READ ON IF YOU ARE TECHNICALLY MINDED and SUPER PICKY about your VIDEO:***A word about Flashlighting, Vertical Banding, Clouding and Dirty Screen Effect. These are the artifacts or 'defects' that plague ALL edge lit LCD/LED panels. Some brands are better than others for keeping them at bay. The exact same model of TV may vary widely from unit to unit. My TV may have more artifacts present while another may not.Basically you need to evaluate your own TV for what you might consider an 'acceptable' level of any or all of these things. By the very nature of an edge lit displays design you just can not escape this, but manufacturing tolerances vary greatly and although you may need to possibly return one or more units you can eventually end up with one you can live with.The flashlighting on this 6200 is VERY slight, but it IS there and more noticeable during certain types of program material. Keeping your backlight down in the 50-55 range with your contrast in the 85 to 90ish range will GREATLY diminish any flash lighting you may experience.  On horizontal pans of light background material you WILL see Vertical banding of varying degrees. I also have SOME dirty screen effect (Google it) and just a BIT of clouding depending on the program material.  This is NOT a product defect, but to be expected with an edge lit LED HDTV. Again, it is very slight and not overly noticeable to most people.Just be aware that ALL these things are inherent in Edge Lit displays. If you just can't live with them (in my case, hardly ANY but still....) then you need to consider a plasma or a full array backlit LCD/LED not an edge lit TV. Also, THOSE types of TVs ALSO have problems, just different ones. (halos, screen uniformity issues, stuck pixels, buzzing, excess heat, burn in, etc.)BOTTOM LINE: With the exception of possibly the new Sharp ELITE models ( more than 5k to start) there is currently no such thing as a perfect display. Do not set your expectations higher than the technology will allow for. I am VERY pleased with this 6200. It offers an increased level of fine detail that was not present in my Pioneer Kuro Plasma from 4 years ago. The picture quality is on par with my LG 7600 , a TV costing a good 400 dollars more. The color accuracy is REALLY good and motion handling extremely good!A word about adjusting your picture: As a rule of thumb, RESIST THE URGE to put your backlight to 100! The mistake many people make while trying to get a good picture is not understanding how to properly find the 'sweet spot' on their TV settings. You want to leave yourself plenty of 'headroom' and not clip the visual dynamic range and end up with everything looking positively radioactive!Put your backlight down around 50 and crank up the contrast to around 85 , and play with your brightness control so that things are neither too dark or washed out. The more brightness you use, the more color intensity is needed, but adjust them in SMALL increments and test them on all types of material. Your cable box/dvr will need a different setting from your Blu Ray player. Every device sends a differently calibrated signal with different ideas of what constitutes a 'nominal' value. I STRONGLY urge you to invest in the Disney Worlds of Wonder, Digital Video Essentials or the Spears and Munsil calibration disc. Do the best job you can , then let the electronics 'burn in' for around 100 hours or so and do it again. It is a tedious process but you will be rewarded with the best picture quality on your block and a much more enjoyable viewing experience! I am currently enjoying overall the BEST picture on ANY HDTV I have ever owned and can thank the Spears and Munsil disc for much of it.**As always, there ARE a small % of tech failures in electronics and purchasing an extended warranty would be a smart move as no matter how expensive something is, electronics DO fail and at the worst possible times.Thanks for reading my review and ENJOY your new LG 6200.

The width of this tv on many sites including Amazon is 36.7 inchs. This is WRONG, Just purchased TV and width is 38.5 inches which is stated correctly in the manual included with 42lm6200 only. So beware of incorrect specs. My cabinet is only 38 inches and tv was supposed to be 36.7 inches. Over an inch to spare, but no, when removed from box tv was 38.5 inches and had to modify my tv cabinet for it to fit. Only half inch so not that bad.Also some sites say TV had LED plus with local dimming. LG even stated that also up untill the past week when they corrected all mistakes on thier web site. TV is only standard LED with NO LOCAL DIMMING.FYI - Has a lot of settings but a few are missing. Like notbeing able to adjust the True Motion. No On or Off or anything to adjust strength of True Motion. It is just on all the time.This TV is great. I would not return it for anything. You can not get a better TV for the money.

The positive reviews are correct. This TV is the best TV value for the money you can buy. The 3D is amazing. Better than at the movie theater. The internet connection is very easy to make using the on screen prompts. This TV can convert any 2D program into 3D with more depth and realism than standard HD broadcasts. You will not get the \"in your face\" 3D effects that you get from real 3D content. Of course, you will need to use the 3D glasses. 6 pairs of 3D glasses are included. They are the lightweight, simple, comfortable, gray lense type. No heavy active, electric, battery, glasses. If you are only interested in knowing that this TV is a great product than you can stop reading now. If you are not technically challenged, read on.I spent 2 days and about 5 hours playing with the adjustments to perfect the picture on my LG TV. Many people never touch the controls and use the TV, as is, right out of the box. Most people love the bright colors, and bright picture. But, you are doing a disservice to this TV and yourself by not adjusting the controls to give you the most amazing detail you ever saw. I used the Spears and Munsil Blu-ray HD Benchmark disc to bring out the best picture possible. For the first time, I can see minute detail, the texture in clothing material, the pattern in wood furniture, the facets in cut stones (not just the sparkle), etc. Now, this is what is considered \"studio standard\" of adjustment. It takes some getting used to, especially since the picture is not as bright or booming as you previously experienced. However, the detail you will now see will blow you away. You do not have to buy the Spears & Munsil disc, because I am going to give you all the settings, in order, you will need to duplicate the picture I spent 2 days and 5 hours perfecting.First, use the Expert 2 choice to input my settings. You should use Expert 1 choice to use the LG's Picture Wizard II to make fast and easy settings for your personal preference. Of course, you can use any of the other pre-programmed settings that you like.Here are my personal settings and recommendations: Choose Expert 2. Now begin to adjust the following settings in order; Backlight(50), Contrast(66), Brightnes(56), H Sharpness(20), V Sharpness(18), Color(54), Tint(0); now press expert control. Dynamic Contrast(low), Super resolution(on), Color Gamut(standard), Edge Enhancer(High), Color Filter(off), Gamma(2.4) now press White Balance. Color temp(medium), Method(2points), Pattern(outer), Points(High), Red, Green, Blue all (0), press close. Color Management System; Color(red), Saturation(0), Tint(0), Luminance(5),now close. Close again. Press picture option; Noise reduction(Low), MPEG Noise Reduction(low), Black Level(low), Real Cinema(On), True Motion(smooth), press close and enjoy!", "Date": "October 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "So far, so AWESOME!!!", "Author": "John W. Scott", "ReviewID": "R188M1VMFEAV0A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having owned a 2004 62\" Toshiba DLP set (62hmx94) for the last 8 years, I didn't want to downsize so I went with the LG 65LM6200 but I got it from HHGregg locally for $2450. I'm blown away by the picture quality and 3d of this set. I think the resolution upscaler (new for 2012) and Triple XD (vs last year's XD, which refers to the number of processors: 3 vs 1)make a difference because standard def content never looked so good! Fired up Born To Be Wild 3d Blu-Ray on my PS3 and I am BLOWN AWAY by the immersive 3d. I watched this movie at the IMAX when it came out and if you own a 3d set, you owe it to yourself to get this one. It is one of the best 3d Blu-Ray experiences out there. I just purchased this TV last night but did a ton of research on this set and the 65LW6500 (last year's model) beforehand and was ready to buy the LW6500 until I was able to get a price within $250 (for warranty and all) of last year's model for the 65LM6200. I didn't feel an extra $700 was worth it but for $250 I was willing to pull the trigger. I'm sure in the next few months the price I negotiated will become the norm so I just sped up my timetable with a little hard negotiating. I really like Amazon but not enough to pay a few hundred more! I did notice a little clouding in the lower middle right of the screen but was able to resolve that by massaging the screen with a microfiber cloth. I have not noticed any of the flashlighting or edge bleed reported with many of last year's LW6500 sets. Maybe I got lucky but hopefully it's because LG addressed this well known issue from last year. I like the WiDi support(haven't used it yet) and dual gaming (not sure if I'll use it) but the 2d to 3d I have used and must say it adds alot to most programming. Great depth control and effect. You can't go wrong with either this set or the 65LW6500 but for a reasonable amount more I felt compelled to go with the 2012 set. I will update this review as my ownership experience with this set evolves.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Deceitful...Please Be Cautious Before Purchasing", "Author": "Nathan Cusick", "ReviewID": "R1J07QL6397BZJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Being an avid Sony TV fan with excellent luck, I took a chance on purchasing this LG for our bedroom.  Huge mistake.  Buyers please beware, these TVs ARE NOT 120 Hz!  After speaking to LG support, they stated that they are 60 Hz and that they will eventually have the option to turn on the TruMotion 120 Hz after a firmware update.  I have read in some of the LG website forums that people have been waiting over 5 months for this update!  The representative stated that you would not see a difference anyway so it isn't a big deal.  Seriously!  Come on LG, if you are going to lie about your products admit it.  Don't dig the hole deeper.Other than the complete lie about the 120 Hz, the TV is not that bad.  However, I wouldn't spend this much money for a 60 Hz TV had I known so.  Also as a side note, the Real Cinema feature they brag about in the advertisement only works on analog connections.  It makes them 24 fps.  If you have an HDMI hooked up, there is no need for it.All in all, great 60 Hz TV but I'm frustrated and disappointed with the deceitfulness of LG.  COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!***Update 8/13/2012***I have decided to change my rating from 1 star to 3 stars. Now that the product works as it intended too (Because the firmware update has been released allowing the TV to display 120 Hz now), it is actually an awesome TV, looks great and was a great price. I will not give it 5 stars though because LG should have anticipated this and not released a partially finished product.If LG had made the TruMotion feature available at the release of this product, I would have gave it 5 stars. Now that it is available, I would recommend this TV because of its features and price.", "Date": "July 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "65LM6200 3D Performance", "Author": "OldRichard", "ReviewID": "R7Z4JCUQ3PR2Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the 65LM6200 installed here for about a week.  Many other reviews describe the features and picture of this HDTV, and all the comparisons you have read concerning the relative merits of plasma displays versus edge lit LED displays do apply in this case.  I will only add comments about the set's 3D performance and about using the set with other IR remote controllers, such as the Logitech Harmony.Passive 3D performance of the 65LM6200 is astounding, particularly with well produced Blu-Ray 3D.  The general reaction of anyone who sees 3D on this set will be \"Wow!\"  This is of course passive 3D, which in my case is key to its enjoyment.  My entire family wears glasses, and the idea of wearing heavy, dark, and battery powered active 3D glasses perched OVER our ordinary glasses is just preposterous.  It wasn't until the advent of passive 3D that requires only lightweight polarized lenses that I even considered investing in a new 3D HDTV.  We use lightweight clip-on polarized lenses with this set, and the 3D image is bright and clear, with no flickering or visible left-right crosstalk.It has been reported that vertical resolution of passive 3D is reduced since the left and right eye images use alternating scan lines resulting in one half resolution, jagged image edges, etc.  However, this concern is overblown.  You will ordinarily see no reduction in vertical resolution since the eye and brain apparently work together to smooth the image.  The only time that I have seen visible scan lines is in the case of bright white lettering (such as closed captions) against a dark background.  And even in this case I must get up off the couch and peer at the screen from a distance of 3 feet or less to see the effect.Regarding remote controls, my home theater is set up using a Logitech Harmony IR remote control.  The LG \"Magic Remote\" that comes with this set is an RF remote control with commands that cannot be imitated by the Harmony.  I was concerned that I might have to give up the Harmony remote and go back to using separate controllers for the HDTV, Cable DVR, Blu-Ray player, game console, and other devices.  Fortunately, the 65LM6200 still provides the capability to respond to a basic set of IR commands such as power on/off, input selection, audio volume, audio mute, TV channel selection, etc.  So it is possible to program a Harmony remote to operate this set as a part of an integrated home theater system for basic television and for Blu-Ray playback.  However, you still must use the LG Magic Remote for system setup, picture adjustment, internet connection and use of any of the LG \"Smart TV\" apps that use on-screen buttons or menus.", "Date": "June 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Brilliant, Excellent, Superb.", "Author": "A Customer", "ReviewID": "R2I9M640IMHP9H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had a lot of monitors, and tv's over the past 3 years and returns or sold everyone because they all had issues either it be ghosting, backlight bleeding that is unsatisfactory, blacks look blue or purple, and severe input lag.I've had the 32LM6200 for a few days now and absolutely enjoy having it. The input lag is unnoticeable, absolutely no ghosting/blur what so ever compared to other lcd based tv's/ monitors I've had and even compared to a TN based gaming monitor. The LK450 I had previously was terrible for being a pc monitor. The text was really bad and seemed like a sharpness issue but whatever sharpness level I tried, it was still there. The 450 had an extremely huge bezel and hated it. This 6200 handles text just like my pc monitor did. Precise, and reds look like the rest of the text. No smudge red text I've seen in previous lg tv's.The buttons on the tv are touch sensitive and have to be touched more so then say a ps3, xbox, or your phone. I like it like that as if I slide my arm under the tv or something the tv won't change on my or turn off. With the tv on there is no led lights on the tv to distract your viewing. Once it's off there is a low output red light. It won't light up your room so don't be concerned. The stand is mindblowing. You can actually set your items under the tv! There isn't a stand in your way and won't have items in your way. You can slide then under the tv and they won't pop out while the stand will keep them blocked in. I can fit a xbox or ps3 controller under the tv. The bezel is nice. About 3/4 of an inch and plastic but looks like brushed aluminum. It's black and looks nice. Don't have to worry about fingerprints or scratches. The stand however is glossy black and is a fingerprint magnet.The picture quality is excellent. Netflix off the tv's smart menu is mindblowing beautiful. Was watching walking dead and never realised how nice the picture was before. It's a night and day difference from the monitor I had. American Dad had some serious WHOA and WOW factor to me. I never seen a cartoon so lifelike so to speak. The colors were excellent and the boarders around the characters were precise. By boarders I mean the black outlining of say their eyes from their face, head from their chest and so on if that makes sense. The cartoon looked so nice I'm off to watch a few seasons just so I can be in awe looking at this tv.If you're looking for a new pc monitor that's not TN based and don't want to pay hundreds of dollars for an IPS that's 27\" then I highly reccomend this at 32\" for around the same price. I played BF3 on this tv on the PC on high settings and was blown away. I don't use the 3d or care much for it but it's a nice feature. The screen is glossy but not as glossy as say a sony NX/HX series, or high end Samsungs. And not as dull as the Sony EX720. It's about in the middle between those two. I'd say it's in the middle of semi gloss and glossy. If you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment and I'll be happy to reply asap. I'll come back in the future and give my thoughts on 3d when I get a 3d movie sometime in the future.EDIT: Just found out it has built in wifi. I went through the connect process and the wifi part said install AP. I thought I had to buy a separate device before. I just clicked on it to see what would happen and it found my SSID and I was able to use it.

I was a bit confused by the nomenclature because so many electronics stores were selling a 6500 series.  So I called LG and found that the 6500 is the 2011 model and the LM6200 is the 2012 model.  I got free shipping from Amazon, so I was wondering if that would mean that the trucking company would drop it at the curb--which for me is 175 ft down a gravel driveway.  I was pleasantly surprised when CEVA, the shipper, told me that the free shipping from Amazon got me \"white glove\" service.  The driver brought the set into my house, unpacked it, then assembled the stand, put it in position and plugged it in. He even ran through the setup menu before he departed, taking the box and all the packing materials with him!As other have said already, the picture is incredible.  Last night my daughter was watching one of the Lord of the Rings movies on a satellite HD channel (Encore).  She has watched this movie many times before on our previous 47\" LCD HDTV.  She pointed out that she could now see details in the picture she had never before seen in the movie.  And the satellite doesn't even give you 1080p (which you do get with Blu-Ray disks).  We also love the remote control that works like a Wii remote.  You just point it and the cursor on the screen follows your hand.  This made setting up the WIFI a snap.  Instead of putting in the password by cursoring up then over to pick a letter or number, with the LG remote you just point and click on the letters you want.  We ordered extra 3D glasses that clip-on to our regular glasses, but found that the six pair of regular 3D glasses that came with the set are very comfortable to wear over our own glasses.  Much better than what you get in a theater.  And unlike the theater 3D, one side isn't darker than the other.  We ran the simulated 3D and found it works fine for some scenes, such as big outdoor expanses, but doesn't generate the same effects in some indoor scenes.  No matter.  We mainly wanted a 3D capable set in case Blu-Ray movies start coming in 3D versions routinely in the future. We have yet to find a 3D movie we want to buy, so we haven't really tried out the set in that mode.  But while early 3D sets were said to be fine in 3D, but had lackluster picture in 2D mode, this model is spectacular in 2D.  The leading consumer testing magazine gave the 6200 an \"excellent\" grade for picture in both 3D and 2D, which is why we bought this set.  Most others they tested got no higher than a \"Very Good\" rating in the picture category.Follow up on 3D:  Since I wrote the report above, my daughter brought home a Blu Ray 3d of Tangled, an animated feature from Disney/Pixar.  We clipped our clip-on 3D glasses over our regular glasses (They run about $12 on Amazon) and started the movie.  I have to say the 3D effects were far better than what we got in the local multiplex movie theater showing the 3D version of Lion King.  Mostly, the 3D involves adding lot of depth.  I'm old enough to remember the 3D movie craze of the fifties, when those movies all featured flaming arrows or tigers that came leaping out into the audience to scare the beejezus out of you.  I hated those as a child.Other than the depth effect, there were only a few things that seemed to float out into your living room.  The flying lanterns ghosted out to where you wanted to reach out to touch them.  But the main thing was the depth that 3D brought to the screen.  The LG system seems to be a great fit with the way Pixar designed the movie.  The picture remains sharp and clear, as the consumer magazine reported.  The clip-on glasses were light and comfortable (they can be flipped up without removing them from your regular glasses for trips to the fridge) and didn't darken one eye the way the theater glasses did.  So, while I probably won't make a big attempt to buy 3D movies, when the latest version of Cars comes out in Blu Ray I will probably opt for that in 3D.  Gotta amaze the neighbors who have a 120 inch projection 1080P system in their home theater. 3D is just fun, and not an everyday thing to us.  But since this set is available with 3D, and the price is in line with other 2D sets, why not get it just in case 3D turns out to dominate the market?

First off, if you aren't familiar with the various types of LED lighting used on LCD panel TV's today, you should do your research on this. This particular TV has EDGE-LIT technology. Thus, LED's are located around the perimeter of the TV. This TV in particular does NOT have local dimming (and it doesn't need it IMHO). LG also offers LED+ (read up about this) and, of course, full-array LED TV's (wherein the entire backlighting of the LCD panel consists of LEDs, all with local dimming). The latter is naturally the most expensive.Anyway, with only edge-lit technology, this TV looks absolutely gorgeous. In fact, it's one of the best looking TV's I have ever seen in person. Multiple people who have now seen my TV have actually said it's the best they've ever seen. And my friends are tech-geeks... so that's saying something.There are a vast amount of lighting AND sound configurations, so you'll def. need to experiment with this to get the picture and sound looking just right.The included apps are legit, with multiple video streaming services available (like Netflix, VUDU, Hulu Plus, etc.). YouTube videos in HD are rendered in true 1080p and look nothing short of STELLAR. The fact I'm even watching YouTube when I load up a HQ video is unreal to me... it's hard to fathom.And to wrap things up quickly--the 3D. Is. AMAZING. It is absolutely the best I've ever seen. To be honest, I actually bought this TV for its TruMotion (and btw, the later manufactured models DO HAVE THIS and DO HAVE THE SETTINGS IN THE MENU!!!!) and its LED technology. The passive 3D was just a bonus, given its extremely affordable and fair price. And I must say... WOW. Literally, 3D stuff jumps right out at you, unlike any other home theater system I've ever seen. Put it this way, this TV is so amazing I'm considering NEVER going to the movie theater again. I can have a substantially better experience in ALL regards with this TV (with the exception of sound... but you need a home theater sound set-up anyway if you want the real deal, so that's a no-brainer). 2D to 3D conversion definitely works pretty well, but algorithms will never be able to truly emulate 3D encoded material when it was encoded in 2D. Actual 3D material looks UNBELIEVABLY AMAZING with this TV.Bottom line: if you're looking for the BEST TV on a budget (namely, edge-lit LED technology), BUY THIS TV. It is truly the BEST.

With the amount of extras this smart tv has, it's definitely well worth the price. One of the best features of course is the 2D to 3D conversion option. It seems to work best when converting blu-rays versus DVD's, but adjustments can be made via 3 different modes of 3D intensity. Console games also jump out at you in amazing 3D, and you can almost swear they were already programmed in 3D. The same can be said about the blu-rays you play in it too. I was literally a couple of days from buying Avatar in 3D, but remembered the extended blu-ray discs in my collection. So I popped them in my player, and WOW... Much like the console games, it's as if this 2D movie was programmed in 3D. Needless to say, I won't be buying the 3D version of Avatar at this point. As for 3D movies, they look equally, if not more amazing. The depth and curvature of faces up close and the enviroments really envelop you into a completely different world.The Smart Remote is also easy to operate, but it takes a minute to get use to. In fact, it's really not all that different from using a Wii remote, if you're familiar with those. The simplicity and ease of it is certainly revolutionary, and should either be an industry standard, or option for most HDTV's.As for the overall design of the unit, it's very easy on the eye and is exceptionally appealing. Its elegant yet simple design with a 3/4 bezel boarder, and is complimented by a modern base that's easy to assemble, and is planted firmly on my computer desk at just the right distance without me experiencing any ghosting or bluriness.Speaking of computer desks, the sole purpose of purchasing this 32 inch unit was my for my computer setup. Most of my time is spent watching movies and viewing pictures, but the main reason why I chose this unit was because of my love for 3D content. I also own a 3D phone with lots of 3D movies, 3D home movies, and 3D pictures - and I have to say that all of these things look great on a bigger screen. What's even better is that the entire family can watch it, courtesy of the 6 pairs of passive 3D glasses this tv comes with.Overall, I have to say that for a 32 inch 3D HDTV this thing rocks!!! LG has come a long way over the years, and has definitely delivered with this product. I realize there aren't that many 32\" 3D HDTV's on the market, but if you're on the fence with this and some other brand, then I would say that you'll be satisfied with this unit.", "Date": "May 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Buyer's regret", "Author": "josh dahms", "ReviewID": "R1G9QBZWTAC12D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this TV a while ago, and I chose it over others for it's awesome smart TV potential.

I noticed some distortion when bass gets high while playing Blu Ray's or regular TV programming.Speaking of Blu Ray's, they look AMAZING.  The picture is perfect.Another user wrote me a comment telling me to check out the 3D films that are provided with the TV (I think I streamed them over the WiFi) and they look amazing too.  The 3D glasses are very light and not much of a nuisance to wear at all.-----------------------------------------------------------------10/19/12 - As many other people have stated, the TV uses TruMotion technology to get the 120 Hz they are advertising, so don't be alarmed when the TV shows it's running at 60 Hz.  With TruMotion turned on, the picture is flat out amazing.  I noticed that when it was set to Clear (a de-judder value of 7) there was some odd effects around the edges of some characters on the screen.  I believe this is the default setting.  Anyways, I changed mine to the Smooth setting (a de-judder value of 3) and it looks MUCH better now.  In my room in particular, glare is not an issue so far and the picture looks good at almost all angles of the room.I have yet to watch a Blu-Ray on this TV so I can't comment on that.The 2d to 3d up-conversion looks decent.  About as decent as it can look I guess.  Again, I'll need to watch a 3d Blu-Ray to actually be able to judge that.First thing when you get this thing hooked up, do a software update!

The further you sit to either side of center the more the illusion degrades, but this is to be expected of passive 3D and I haven't had too much of an issue with it.  Otherwise the picture quality is great and the apps are a fun little add-on (albeit a little impractical).

The technology just does not work on some tvs. This tv has passive 3D and works well for upscaling DVDs to 3D and works fantastic for Blu-ray 3D. However, 2D converted to 3D was not that great.

The magic remote fits nicely in your hand but that is where the enjoyment ended for me.Some of the other features like ARC (Smartlink), AV input, and component input I have not tested.A note about the bluetooth and wifi modules. The bluetooth is strickly for the magic remote. You can not pair any other bluetooth device. The wifi support both 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz networks.

I bought the Sony KDL40-EX720 which was beautiful and crisp, but didn't maximize the space of my entertainment center. Traded it in for a Panasonic TC-L42D30, which was sub-par on color accuracy and motion, acted like a 60 Hz TV. We had a Sony 27\" CRT for 16 years and it died, so the kids got the LCD Panasonic 32-incher we bought 2 years ago. I was actually quite impressed with that TV, which was why we decided to give the Pana LED TV a fair try.Enter the LG 42LM6200. Really enjoying the experience...PROS* HD is clear, sharp, and vivd. AT&T; only allows for 1080i video but it's, in my mind, as visually good as the Sony and a step up from the Panasonic LED.* Store appraisal still holds in the home. When I had my eye on this, I went to Best Buy and looked at their 4 TV side-by-side display with the LG, Panasonic, Sony, and Samsung. I inputted calibration figures, updated the firmware, and it looks as good as it did in store (clearer, smoother, and brighter than the Panasonic TC-L42E50, on par with the Sony & Samsung).* Motion is smooth. Still juddering, especially on motion-intensive. But it handles most motion fine - NFL, Transformers, Indiana Jones, etc.* Uhhh... the TV fits! It's 38.5\" across, and my cabinet is just over 39\" across. I was worried when I saw the HDMI inputs all go into the left back side of the TV, but they fit. Next TV might be bigger and we'll take advantage of a wall mount, but it will need to be an articulating arm and I'm afraid our 4 kids will destroy the arm and the TV.* 3D conversion is quick and easy. Push a button, and it converts while you are putting on the passive glasses. Fun and cool technology. Converts brightness to adjust for loss of clarity on 3D automatically.* Like the smart TV option. LG has put many common options on a single screen (Netflix, YouTube, etc.).* Magic Wand remote - I happen to like it. It's less aggravating to me than the Wii remote, which is too sensitive and jumpy for me. Now that the family has gotten comfortable with it, I'm going to integrate all functions into the MW remote. And since LG has a smart phone/tablet app that mimics the remote, it's all going to be pretty easy, I think.* Price: Amazon priced this TV $100 below Best Buy or any other competitive web site or bricks and mortar store.CONS* Wi-Fi: The TV may be Smart, but it's not fast. Accessing content and web sites is slow. For example, ESPN looks great... when it finally loads up. I know we're trying to push Wireless N back into a wireless G router, but it's slow. Most web sites take 10 seconds to fully load.* Smart content: Navigating through web sites with the remote is a bear. Don't know of a quick way to block content and certain web sites from my kids, that should be a lot simpler and easy to access.* Motion: I know most people wouldn't even care, but there is juddering on some motion. It's not predictable, sometimes on busy pictures and sometimes on scenes I wouldn't expect to show any problems.* Small thing: The TV is bright and crisp, but the screen does have a bit of a glossy finish. I would have liked a matte finish but I was very picky on the size, this is the only 42\" TV worth having that actually fit my space needs.So far: I bought this TV because I liked the 2D HD performance, with the added features of Smart TV and 3D being a bonus. 40% discount off retail also made this very easy.", "Date": "September 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "OUTSTANDING PICTURE AND 3D", "Author": "Nitpicker", "ReviewID": "R1QFFMVPAROMBX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this LG 65LM6200 as a replacement for a Samsung TV which developed the infamous \"white dots\".  My previous Samsung had defective capacitors.(Google both problems).  We also have a Panasonic ST50 in a darker area of the house, so we wanted a brighter TV which could handle the many windows in our living room.Delivery was on time and went smoothly (kudos to Amazon).I was amazed at the clarity and brightness of the picture right out of the box.  With very little tweaking using applications included in the TV, I was able to get an outstanding picture.  For those who feel the need to calibrate the set, the TV has the inputs for that.  I personally believe most viewers will be happy with only minor adjustments.  Picture on the Panny ST50 is sharper and more natural but not as bright. The LG picture has a punch and wow factor that is really something to behold. The colors really jump out with an exceptional brightness.As was mentioned in previous reviews, the LG screen is highly reflective.  The brightness of the screen seems to minimize most reflections, however.  My wife says her shopping channels are easier to view, even in a bright living room, so the LG passed a key test :)WiFi setup was simple and quick with no problems connecting to my network.  Software upgrade was similarly quick and easy.I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the passive 3D technology used in this LG set.  The 3d glasses provided are exceptionally light and work great.  The 3d image quality is excellent.  The passive technology is not quite as sharp (less lines of resolution) as the active technology used on the Panny plasma, but the image quality is still amazing and will impress most viewers.  (The 3d image quality also impressed a well known consumer research agency).The LM6200 is connected to Dish network and what I (and my wife) noticed immediately is the improvement in the quality of SD channel images (HSN QVC).  This is possibly due to the built-in up-scaler used in this TV.Now for my one complaint.  Again, as mentioned by others, the \"Magic Remote\" seems to be a love-it or hate-it proposition.  Although not difficult to use for most people, operation involves moving a cursor across the TV screen with an RF signal.  My wife is severely visually impaired (very limited field of vision).  She normally changes channels and performs other functions by touching remote keys.  For her, this \"Magic Remote\" is useless.  Fortunately, since we go through the Dish receiver, most common viewing functions are handled by the Dish remote.  For anyone with Dish, the remote code for this TV is 766. On a lighter side, using this remote is like watching a rerun of a SNL Wii controller demo.  Yes, you actually do have to wave the remote from side to side as part of getting it to work.In conclusion, in spite of an \"unusual\" remote, I can highly recommend this TV.  The price is superb, Amazon service and delivery by Pilot was outstanding,picture quality is excellent, 3d viewing is excellent (our grand-kids love it.)UPDATE 19 APRIL 2013:  Latest software upgrade provides access to Amazon Prime Videos.

Besides the youtube, netflix, hulu, and those social apps, the LG apps pretty much suck.

IDKHowever the Dual-Play for all my gamers, does in fact work!  It is however like taking that smaller screen and stretching it. Sometimes things may look a little funny as compared to a regular full screen, but hey its for games that are not made to do this. I couldnt find any glasses yet made for dual play, so i just reworked 2 of the glasses LG gave me to make it functionable.  This could also be one of the reasons why there is a very little bit of the others person screen that can be seen during this mode.

But I'm finding that shows like The Good Wife, Modern Family, ESPN and The Golf Channel take on a whole different perspective when viewed in 3D.  Shows with lots of scenery and sweeping camera shots like The Travel Channel or American Idol with the audience opposite the singers and the extravagant sets make the best use of the 3D.  It makes it seem like you're there. These newer, passive 3D glasses are light and comfortable, even over other glasses, not heavy like some of the old active lenses used to be.  They're more like regular, light sunglasses that you don't have to take off to read the TV guide or to go into the kitchen to get a snack.  We also ordered a couple pairs of 3D Glasses - Circular Polarized Clip on 3D Glasses for RealD and Disney Digital Theaters and Acer 3D Laptop - Stepup 3D- Dispicable Me, Toy Story 3D because my husband prefers the clip-ons.There are a few DirecTv stations that are broadcast in 3D that can be watched using the same DVR that we use for regular shows on channels 103 through 107.  (You have to have a model HR21 or above.) One channel is a pay per view, the others are free.  There isn't much to choose from yet, but it's a start.  I understand that Comcast also has a few 3D channels and Dish Network has 3D movies that you can rent.  If you want to play 3D movies using a DVD player you'll need a Blu-ray 3D DVD player.  We've watched Hugo (Three-disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy) and Alice In Wonderland (Four-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy) in 3D and both are outstanding.The picture on this TV is crisp and clear and there are lots of choices of settings for both the regular programming and the 3D.  We like the depth control on the 3D set to max on the manual setup and the view perspective turning all the way down. That way the picture looks like it's set deeper than the edge of the screen with images in the foreground looking almost level with the screen edge.  We're still fine tuning some of the regular TV settings to get color, sharpness, gamma, etc. the way we think it looks best.I was afraid that with the speakers in the back and on the bottom that it would be difficult to hear, especially in a room with tile floors and not too great acoustics.  While waiting for the TV to arrive from Amazon I looked at several sound bars but decided to wait until we could try the TV.  I'm glad we waited because the sound is very clear and plenty loud enough.  There are lots of sound settings to play with, even a surround sound simulator that sounds pretty darn good.  I have a much easier time hearing it than I did with the old Sony Bravia, especially when there are other sounds in the room.When looking at the TV from the side it's hard to believe a TV with all that 3D depth can actually be so thin. The picture comes out almost to the edge so even though this replaced a 40 inch TV, it ended up being about the same size overall because the other TV had speakers on the front sides and a larger frame on the top and bottom.  The only thing that I find to be a drawback is that it has a reflective screen.  It's not real glossy like some, but with the afternoon sun coming in the room it's noticeable enough that we draw the blinds.This is a Smart TV that connects to your home Wifi and allows you to surf the web, try out different apps or connect to Netflix, Vulu, Youtube, Facebook, Twitter and some other included content.  (Check out the \"Mentalist\" 3D video on you Home menu under LG 3D World.  It's a short video that has some great out of screen (OOS) effects.) Connecting to our home network was fast and simple. It found the network right away, we clicked on it, put in a password, and Voila! we're connected.  It has 4 HDMI imputs and a dedicated HDMI audio return channel and an optical audio output and has 3 USB inputs.  It also has component video inputs.  The HDMI and USB are on the side, near the front,  easy to get at without crawling behind the TV.You're either going to love or hate the Magic Remote. If you've owned a Wii you'll probably be happy with it. It acts pretty much the same. It may seem a little skittish at first, but by the time you get your TV set up the way you want it and use it to look around at all the features it'll feel much more accurate. This remote is used to turn the TV on and off, switch between regular TV and 3D, access the menu, and control the volume. We have DirecTv which has its own remote as well as a URC R40 \"My Favorite Remote\" Advanced Universal Remote Control for up to 18 A/V Components and I've managed to program most of the commands into these remotes with the exception of the 3D settings and some of the apps menus.  There may be a way to do that, just haven't had the time to play around with it yet.  There's also an iPhone app that you can get that will turn your phone into a remote.According to the guide it should cost $12 a year to run this TV, based on 11 cents per kwh and 5 hours per day use. This of course, would depend on your utility rates and how long you actually watch it, but they figure the average TV between 45\" and 49\" costs somewhere between $18 and $51 a year to run.  There are a lot of comparisons out there between LCD and LED but from one that I found for a similar LCD this LED used about 42% less energy.  That's pretty impressive.It's amazing the advances that TV's have made in the last few years and this one is a good example of the many more features available at a more reasonable price.

Also, a friend bought it in the 55\" size after I had done the research, and they are as satisfied as I am.  Their only complaint is that their young grandchildren will not be able to watch 3D.It took me about 8 days to get the color the absolute way I wanted it to be, my friends were satisfied right off the bat!  The picture is so clear and sharp, and the flesh tone (which is what I base my true colors on) is realistic.  The picture appears to be almost 3D without the 3D on, that's how clear the picture is.My only complaint, and it's not really a complaint, is the screen is very reflective of the light in the room.  I have many windows, and if I want to watch TV during the day (which is not often), I need to close all the blinds.

I wanted something WIFI, LED and 3D - so my choices were extensive, but after a TON of research, it was evident that this LG product struck the best balance with overall features and quality.After owning it for a couple weeks I have the following opinions to offer:Pros:- After taking my time with this TV's \"picture wizard\" walk-through, I am quite pleased with this TV's picture.- Wonderful remote control! Great innovation and extremely easy to love.- Passive 3d works well enough - especially if the video is designed for it.- Decent WIFI (not 100% perfect).- TV is very easy to use, and onscreen menus are well thought out.Cons:- I have not seriously explored the smart TV apps that come with it, but I'm not very impressed thus far.- 3D bezel blur (approx. 1 in) occasionally shows up on bottom of screen during 3D view.- Slow loading times when switching modes. Seems like only the high-end models come with adequate processing power. Huge bummer!- 120 HZ is low for this type of TV. I think it should be better for what you pay.Overall, I am happy with this TV. I went with LG because of my present experience with a Flatron W2753V LCD that has been a loyal monitor for me for quite some time. I've heard some nightmare stories concerning LG customer service, so I'm not looking forward to any breakdown issues.  However, it is my own experience that their products are reliable.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not a horrible TV, but close.", "Author": "Darrin", "ReviewID": "R3KICKMX2LSGV1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I honestly do not understand why this TV has received so many positive reviews. Perhaps the manufacturer has paid one of those crooked marketing companies to place fake positive reviews about their product? I don't know. My own experience with this TV was far from glowing.One of the biggest problems with this TV is the \"Magic Remote\". I believe that the folks at LG believe that the word 'magic' means \"to be completely useless and make simple tasks incredibly difficult.\" This remote forces the user to interact with the TV with a buggy and difficult to use on-screen pointer (similar to a Wii remote, but not as easy to use). If the designers at LG had been thinking clearly, they would have left the typical number-pad, input selector and other buttons on the remote, but they didn't. On top of that, the interface for the TV is illogical and poorly designed. To do such basic thing such as changing the channel, you either have to use the channel up and down buttons and navigate through who knows how many channels to get to the one you want, or use the mouse to summon an on-screen keypad to click on the numbers on the screen. Sounds easy enough until you have to use the stupid Magic Remote. Did I mention that it sucks? If you are having a hard time getting the on-screen pointer to line up with one of the on-screen buttons, the display will 'time-out' after only a few seconds so you have to start all over again. I suspect that this would be next-to impossible to use for some elderly folks and others who lack dexterity in their hands.When I first set-up my TV, I used the auto-program feature to set all of my cable-TV channels. Once done, I was able to watch everything that was available with no problem. However, after turning the TV off and on again, for some reason all of the HD channels seemed to have disappeared (or at least they were skipped when I used the channel up/down buttons). I found that I could get them back temporarily by going to the channel list and adding all of the HD channels to a favorites list then using that favorites list. Even then, as soon as I access any menu on the TV, it would revert back to skipping over the HD channels. What!?!?! Why?!?!?! I can only imagine what sort of incompetent or delusional fools they let design TVs at LG.I hoped to use this TV in conjunction with my digital home media library. I bought this TV because it was able to access my media library wirelessly. I got it all set up and was, as you might guess, very disappointed in how it worked. Their software does not identify movie directories such as what is used by XBMC or the Windows Media Center plugin \"Media Browser\". This means it does not pick up TV series info files or movie data files in order to display friendly names or group videos that are split into multiple files. The result is that the interface navigates in the same way as a typical computer file-system browser, rather than a proper media library. Fail.All of that said, if you are looking for a TV to use as just a display (all of your TV watching comes from an external device), this one would work just fine. I would point out that you would be paying for a bunch of (poorly designed) features that you'll never use, though you'll be happier for it.I also want to mention that my experience with Amazon thus far has been great. The TV was delivered the day after I ordered it (via Amazon Prime \"2-day\" shipping). I am in the process of returning the TV and so-far-so-good, but it's too early to comment on that part. Overall, Amazon has always been pretty awesome to deal with, so I hope that trend continues.

Consumer Reports rated this model in the top 10 for this screen size.  First off appearance:  The TV has a thin 1\" black border which by any standard, almost brings the picture to the edge.  Although I would have liked a chrome edging instead of black, it is still a very sharp looking product.  The speakers, while nothing on the line of surround sound, are certainly a huge improvement from the other flat screen tv's that I own.  The sound is crisp, clear, and unless it is turned up to the max, there is no tinniness or distortion in it's sound.  Picture:  Wow!  3D TV....double WOW!  One thing I will warn you on if you purchase this TV, like any flat screen tv that you purchase, you will have to adjust each and every picture setting until you obtain the best picture suitable for you.  This is not accomplished in one sitting, as each time you turn the tv on, you'll adjust it again, and again, and finally you will have the picture that is best for the majority of channels.  It's taken me three days of adjustments to get to the point that I'm at now which is definitely loving the picture quality.  The apps are amazing and I've had much fun exploring them.  Between Hulu and Vudu alone, the number of movies available are endless.  I am a member of Netflix and love now that I can pull up their wonderful assortment of movies right on my TV.  The 3D aspect is simply amazing.  I see no difference whatsoever in the quality of this set compared to the quality in movie theaters.  The glasses are so light weight and I'm so glad I went with a passive system over an active system. Not only are the glasses a 10th of the weight as active shutter glasses, but they cost about a 10th to purchase as well and there is no fluttering that many claim they can see with the active system.

This means Pandora, AOL music, any karaoke website I pulled up, any website at all...none of them produce sound on my TV.  The only website currently is YouTube and that is because LG has an \"App\" for that.  I'm very disappointed as having an internet feature is one of the main reasons I purchased.

There are two 3D technologies.  One uses switching glasses and the LG uses polarized glasses.  Here is what is wrong with electronic switching glasses such as Sony and Samsung.  Each eye is rapidly turned on and off.  This makes moving images appear to have small jumps from point to point in space.  The eye and brain have difficulty with this.  I find it hard to focus and the moving images are somewhat erratic kind of like when you hold a neon light in your hand and move it quickly you see a series of flashes as it cuts on and off.  Well thats what happens when you have motion for TVs that use electronic switching.  LG however has a different approach that results in smooth non jittery motion in both 2D and 3D.  The 120 frames per second smoothly transform from one to the next without flashing and without bluring the moving image.  LG has to do predicitive interpolation since the HD frames are not transmitted this fast, so they have to create intermediate frames that are smooth transitions from one transmitted frame to the next.  This makes fast motion appear to be smooth and sharp and it is with their new LED 3D TVs.  The way LG does their 3D is not shutting an eye on and off but to keep each eye looking at the smooth frames all the time so there is no jittery movement.  Its much easier on the eyes than the shuttered electronis glasses.  They way they get 3D is to polarize each line alternating horiz and vert polarization.  This is fixed on the screen and is one reason the screen must be shiny so there is not crossover on polarization.  With the 3D glasses on each eye sees just the image that is matched to that eye, either horizontal or vertical polarization.  Although there is some loss in the number of lines, the mind puts the left and right images together to form a 3D image that is as sharp as the 1920 by 1080 original image.  Its not at all 480 p as some people would have you believe.  Its much sharper than that.The TV works very well after a week of operation.  It has a web browser as well as N and G wifi built in and LAN.  The web browser is not as powerful as a web browser for your PC.  Some formats are not supported such as .doc files, etc.  I also noticed that livestreaming some web sites such as Al Jazeera live stream doesnt run smoothly, possibly because the built in web browser is not as up to date as the adobe flash that is needed.  And you cannot add the latest adobe flash yourself.  You have to wait for an update from LG which comes frequently, every few days.  There is one other thing you need to know.  The only audio output is a fiber optic cable.  I wish they had included a simple stereo jack audio output I could have hooked my headphones up to.  Outboard audio system that do not use fibre optic imput to the amplifier are not compatible with this TV.  Possibly this is something you need to consider.  Of course you could add an audio device that converts fibre optic signal to regular audio.  Fortunately my audio system did have fiber optic input.

LED technology makes for an amazing picture thatis notably better than my older LCD HDTV... and this LG delivers all ofthe latest bells and whistles. The Wii style remote is great if youlike Wii remotes. Otherwise, you'll quickly tire of constantly tryingto guide the screen curser to the right screen location and possiblyclicking the \"wrong\" button. In the last few weeks, I've found myselfclicking \"mute\" instead of \"enter\" because they are both centrallylocated and slightly raised. From a usability standpoint, the remoteis a negative for me. Regarding my use of built-in apps like Netflixand Hulu Plus, I have some qualms with the application stability viawi-fi. While displaying full bars in the LG wi-fi connectivity screen,I've noticed some flakey behavior for HD programming on Netflix andHulu Plus. Until I do a direct connect to my cable modem, I'll chalkup the frozen apps (on Netflix and Hulu Plus) to network throughputissues. **see update** As mentioned above, the LG 47LM6200 includes all the latesttechnologies including 3D. So, this may come as a surprise tomanufacturers, but most folks don't want to sit around in the familyroom wearing 3D glasses unless its for the full-on 3D movieexperience. And until there's a better selection of 3D Blu-rayrentals, I can't find a compelling reason to plunk down an additional$50 for 3D support on a standard Blu-ray Disc Player. Enough of thetechnology rants... The bottom line is that I'm extremely pleased withthe quality picture provided by the LG 47LM6200. And that's what\"watching TV\" is all about, right? This 4 star review (vice 5 star) isbased on my less than stellar experience with the remote and thestreaming apps.**June 2012- We switched the WiFi signal to our newer Apple Airport (we had been using another, much older router, and the stability issues have disappeared.

I called LG customer service, which whilst not being rude are somewhat indifferent. Of course they did not have any local technicians that they could contact on my behalf but were able to provide me with the telephone number of just ONE local business that could do this for me. As others have said, please contact LG customer service and make sure they can service your tv in your area, because chances are you will need them to. I totally recommend the extended warranty also. Better still, buy a different brand.I have contacted the technician myself and yes he can repair this but it means time off work for me (are you paying for that LG?!) and what is the guarantee it will not break again in another 5 months? Frankly I am appalled about all this. I have never had a televison serviced before EVER but the difference is they were all Sonys. Why oh why did I choose a different brand this time?! That is something I am living to regret. I was suckered in by glowing reviews in trade magazines (where reliability never seems to figure) and reviews on here. I should have paid more attention to the negatives. Other than reliability (which is huge to me) I have enjoyed using it, I think the picture quality is good and love the remote. We use the television rarely and then just to watch dvds or netflix or PBS. I don't bother with all the fancy pants stuff and I can get Amazon through the dvd player (a Sony) so not having that on the TV is not an issue. But I cannot recommend this TV to anyone, not when it develops problems after five months of light use.......Update. The repair service was fantastic and the place that did it is also a major distributor of LG and Sony televisions in the area (as well as other brands, but these are their big two), as well as being a big repair service. I did ask them for their opinion of the reliability of LG televisions and they reckon its generally good and that its rare they are called in to repair them. I wanted to mention this in the interest of fairness. Maybe Amazon got a bad batch, who knows. But if this is the tv you really want I think I would recommend trying to buy it from a local store, rather than online. Just in case.

This TV is fantastic.PICTURE: The picture is great! Watching Netflix is truly a great experience. I'm not an expert in colors, resolutions and stuff, but when you can clearly see details of the character's face of the movie you're watching, you know you made the right choice. I think one of the most beautiful experiences with this TV was watching the documentary Planet Earth on HD. You fall in love with this TV.3D: Not a great fan, but I've seen a couple of 3D movies and it works great. Being this TV passive 3D, the only recomendation is that the TV must be placed at the same height you are sitting. Mine came with 4 sets of glasses :DAPPS: The big winner is Netflix. I've spend so much time with it last six months. The great thing is most of its content is on HD, so you'll get the best of you LG TV. The other app I enjoy is Plex Media Center (AKA Media Link), it allows me to watch all the movies I have in my PC in the TV. It sorts beautifully all my files and adds synopsis, cover, rating, cast, etc. for each movie! It's amazing!The big let down, IMO, is the YouTube app. Not really my favorite. But there's a ray of sunshine in every dark cloud, and there's a LG app called WatchBig, that allows you to open YouTube on your Android device and pair it with your TV. Amazing! Works like a charm.SOUND: I have no complains, is more than enough for my room. Like someone over here said, you can't expect such a flat screen to carry some enormous speakers.USB: One big surprise. This TV reads almost every type of video file. I remember back on the days when my DVD (also LG) could only read AVI files, that and of course the painful process of burning the video file on a DVD disc. Now I simply copy the file into my USB flash drive and voil\u00e1! As simple as that. The video formats I've sucessfully tried are: AVI (DivX, Xvid), MPEG, MP4, MKV and others. The only one that does not read until to now is RMVB.The subtitle support is great. I've only tried SRT, but the great thing is you can change the size, color, delay and such properties of the subtitles. I dreamed about this since I had my first DVD player.Overall, I'm really happy with this TV.BTW, mine came with a regular LG Remote, I was disappointed at first, then my sister got another LG TV and she got the Magic remote, I tried it and...

I only have a couple of things which I've found lacking1) the Adobe flash isn't up to speed in updating so consequently we can't watch the videos on the internet through browsing with the TV... bummer .  We started watching TV programs online when we couldn't watch the Summer Olympics because we didn't have Xfinity  TV, so we watched in on the net with BBC.  Much better coverage, but that started a trend, we now watch many of our shows through the net and if Xfinity is required we just wait for Netflix.  I don't thing Comcast should be allowed to exclude people from watching things online.... but that is another issue.  At any rate, watching Comedy Central, Castle on abc etc all still have to be done through the computer which can update the Adobe flash.2) the second thing is the remote, it's timing seems to be alittle lagging... it also times out too quickly and jumps about rather than having the controls I would prefer.

This had best value, looks and performance for the money.MINUSES:- SMART CONTROLLER: The controller acts like a mouse with a cursor that moves across the screen, you can program it to also control your Cable Box, it adds 1 step by having to activate that particular menu but saves you from having more than 1 remote. I did get used to it and overall its perfectly fine.

Very pleased so far.After mounting it and turning it on, I was just as impressed.  Picture is great, connected to my home network easily.  Even the odd magic remote is starting to grow on me.  There's also a great Android app to use your phone or tablet as a remote as long as both are on the same wifi network.  The only negative I've seen is the standard light bleed from the edge lit LED, but it's consistent or better than other models in the same category.  I don't expect my SUV to get 40mpg or my hatchback to give me 200hp, so I won't expect my edge-lit LED to not have a tiny bit of light bleed on the edge.Passive 3D is great, and the 2D to 3D conversion is surprisingly solid.

Some Toshiba and Panasonic sets seem to be using some of the same tech, but the extra money spent on the LG is well worth it, especially if you can get a steal through a Amazon Warehouse deal.

As good as that tv was, I have to say this one blows it away.. I've always loved Samsung tv's an this is my first LG, but I couldn't be more satisfied. For one the features and contrast ratio (6,000,0000:1) are a lot better and more advanced. The different picture and sound features once configurated will bring the best out if this HDTV. I actually have the tv connected to my Directv receiver, Sony 7.1 receiver, and Yamaha speakers. The AV Sync mode the tv offered helped out a whole lot to sync picture with audio, considering I'm using an external audio mode. The only flaw I've noticed is the slight audio/image delay caused by the fact the receiver puts out dolby digital audio and me not having digital optical cables from tv to audio receiver directly. I have digital optical cables from Sony audio receiver to Directv receiver, and from Sony audio receiver to PS3 but not directly to tv. Everything connected via HDMI picture wise, but I am going to have to get digital optical cables so they go directly from tv to Sony audio receiver. I was told this will stop slight audio/picture sync issue.. The passive 3D is pretty badass and a lot more in depth than the 3D I got from my Samsung Plasma with active glasses. Definitely a cinema feel to the 3D. The only flaw once again was the 3D channels on Directv, especifically ESPN 3D, show the audio/picture sync issue I mentioned about earlier because of cable configuration. Smartv apps are cool but I haven't tried them much. I rather watch Netflix directly through my PS3 but Youtube and Skype included in Apps for tv is cool to have. Haven't tried all the apps content but will review when I do. Last thing I'd like to mention is the Trumotion feature this LG HDTV offers. It definitely makes a difference watching Football games (or other sports), Bluray movies, and Pixar/Dreamworks animated films! For that type of viewing leave Picture TruMotion feature at Smooth, clear, or User. You can make your discretion to see which one looks best. For regular HD programming and HBO movies and such leave Trumotion off as having it on gives off a Soap opera/play like look to movies and programs.. By the way this tv is Trumotion at 120HZ and the different Picture Trumotion options show that. The 60Hz you see in the tv info when watching programs is the source of your satellite or cable provider.. Even Blurays come at 24Hz but this Tv does give you Trumotion option features up to 120HZ. Apologize for the long review, but truth is this HDTV is badass and has a lot of features to touch base on for review.Update August 18,2012:As I had figured it would be the case, I was able to completely sync the audio/picture issues perfectly by connecting optical digital cables from the Sony audio receiver to the tv! Even the 3D Directv channels specifically ESPN are synced perfectly. Makes this tv even more enjoyable now.

The picture, the sound, and it's performance has been WOW. Now maybe I should only give it four and half stars account that it's manual doesn't even start to tell you all you need to know, for example, certain movies sounded pretty bad until I discovered that it was factory set for a wall-mount and that I had to change it for a cabinet mount, which I had done...made all the difference and setting up your picture, jeepers this can be a science in itself, I still don't have a clue what all the 3d settings are, but the \"wonder of discovery\". Sometimes the picture is so clear you swear you'right there. A long time ago I backed the contrast to about 75% because many of my movies did not look like \"films\" but had more of of a video look to them. The only real mystery to me is the 120hz, nowhere, except on the box, do you see it, nowhere in the manual, or on the information screen. There is the remark on the backside which states 60hz/50, so I wonder if this means left and right eyes giving you a total of 120, but I just don't have the knowledge and so far LG has not returned any of my e-mails regarding this. I can state that so far I have not experienced any blur problems and I do have a lot of action movies. Now I do want everyone out there to know that other then the picture, it's biggest selling point to me is the fact that it converts 2d to 3d (something the Vizio can't do).

You will still need your Roku box or your smart DVD Player. I called LG's customer service to find out about it and was connected to a lady who I am certain was in Indonesia. In stereotypical form, she knew nothing. She had to \"place me on hold for a few minutes\". When she came back, she had me check to see if I had the most current software which of course I did.

Of course, I'm a tight budget.  If you are an audiophile or want true surround sound obviously you will want to invest in a sound system.  However I find the stock system more than adequate for my small apartmentit's easy to hook up to your wireless network, although you will have to go through the usual \"point and click\" method with the remote to input your password assuming you secure your connection.as far as the magic wand remote goes, i find it mostly very easy to use.  it gets a little frustrating sometimes because sometimes i have to point it at the TV and move it around to get it to flip into active mode.  It's kind of fun though because i can point it right through an obstruction such as my laptop screen and it still works.  it's very easy and intuitive to use.  the battery compartment can be a bit frustrating but nothing too upsetting.  my main complaint is the odd shape can make it roll and fall rather than sit nicely in one spot.  However I'm learning to work with that.  i rather like the lack of complicated buttons.NOTE: I have an LG bluray player (soon to be a 3d player) and the remote for that will also work to some degree on the TV, e.g. i can power on/off etc. and it is a traditional remote.  I have found in the past that getting the same manufacturer for each element of my media systems tends to promote smoother interaction)I find the 2D-3D feature works quite well and am enjoying many programs in 3D.  Not quite as good as true 3D but pretty impressive IMO.CONS:While the passive 3D is fun, I'm wondering if active 3D (which was out of my price range) wouldn't be better.  At least I'm assuming this is a characteristic of passive 3D; everything is in three dimensions, but they all seem to reside \"behind the window\" of the screen.  I haven't gotten the \"pop\" value of 3D (out of the screen).BACK TO PROS: with that said, the glasses are light and easy, creating no eye strain for me.  I can look down and work on my laptop while I'm wearing them and experience no distortion which is very handy.  I haven't had any problems with breakage and when they get dirty (i'm hard on stuff) they clean up easily, I haven't had any scratches or distortions.Overall I am very happy with my purchase.  I thought I had bought a 3D bluray player but big FAIL on that so I'm returning it and waiting on the new one, so I haven't been able to enjoy much true 3D content, although there is a 3D premium service available through the TV home screen.  I have a number of 3D bluray videos waiting to be watched; i hope my new player comes soon!  I just wish the price was a little lower.  550 for a 32\" TV is much more than I'd hoped to spend.ALSO NOTE: placement is essential, not only due to the size of the screen, but to get the 3D effect.  I find the TV needs to be almost exactly 9-10\" from my eyes to get the correct effect.

My husband wanted a Smart TV. Neither of us wanted to pay a lot, and we didn't want anything bigger than 32-inches. We lucked out when I found this TV offered as an Amazon Gold Box Deal.The picture is great. The Energy Smart feature is nice, but it's a feature you have to turn off if the picture gets too dark. That sometimes happens in a dark room, as it adjusts to the light around it. This is especially true when you have it set to show 2D as 3D. Then the picture can get way too dark, so you have to play with the settings to turn off the energy saving feature.I don't know much about the Smart TV content. Aside from streaming Netflix--awesome!--we don't use it much. Maybe that will change as we get used to the TV and  more content becomes available.The feature that most surprised us is the 2D to 3D one. We popped a DVD of Eureka into our DVD player, and--oh, my goodness--it honestly looked like it was filmed in 3D. It was amazing! We try not to watch too many shows like this, because it can cause headaches, but considering we weren't even looking for a 3D TV and we got incredible 3D for the price of a 1080p LED, even without Smart TV, just blows us away.The sound is also impressive. I know that's an issue other people have had with other LED sets, but the sound is great here.The Smart remote is fun, but I worry about losing or breaking it. Guess we should buy a backup.My one and only concern involves how delicate this thing is. You should try to run it at least once a week, and if you're away for a week, you should unplug it. That's what it says in the owner's manual.I bought clip-on 3D lenses to wear over my glasses, and I really like them. So does my daughter, so we'll be buying another pair. That way we don't have to argue about who gets to wear the clip-ons and who has to wear 3D glasses over her glasses.So to sum up, if you want a 1080p LED Smart TV with 3D at a great price, this is the set for you.

I love the picture quality and the 3D is fantastic. I bought this 65inch set based on how happy I was with my 42inch LG set (now my bedroom set). Now for the bad news. THE REMOTE CONTROL is supposed to be simple by having a minimum number of buttons. It is supposed to simplify operating the TV. After 2 days of using this remote I was ready to throw it at the screen. Instead of pushing a button for a function you must now point at the screen to move a pointer on the screen, and then go through menu after menu to get what you want! If you have a shaky hand you will miss icons on the screen and have to start all over. My nephew has MS and can't hit an icon on this TV to save his life, yet he can text messages on a smart phone like a pro. There are no number buttons so now you must scroll with a thumb wheel or wave the remote to get an icon of a keypad then try to hit the channel number you want. Remember the last channel button, so you could flip between two channels? you don't get that either. I'm actually using my old 42inch TV remote to run my new TV. LG should give you a regular remote option or include both with this TV. I will never again buy a HDTV with a made for kids toy REMOTE CONTROL. I'm 65 years old and say quit simplifying and give me more buttons. First you removed the pic in pic, then freeze frame button, now the last channel button.

I miss the setup we had with a Roku, and for our uses that was far better than this.Our quirks: We are mostly Netflix users, plus some Amazon video and moving towards Hulu and the like. We have an antenna, but no TV cable service. If you're buying this primarily to watch cable TV, great... but then why are you paying for all the extra features.Pros:1. Yes, it's a lovely pictureCons:1. Very laggy when using the remote before the TV decides to obey. This includes pausing a video, selecting a movie (Netflix), or other content2. Can't get Amazon videos, which is a service we regularly use, and can't get Pandora3. Netflix videos regularly hang. Probably related to number 44. It regularly loses the wireless connection and we have to reconnect5. When you turn the TV off, it doesn't \"save state\", remembering what you were watching before.6. The remote is not well designed in terms of the available buttons and their locations. For example, the power on/off is near the position of the regular selector, making it relatively easy to power off instead of select.Since I am mostly watching Netflix, here is the tedious sequence that I go through to watch TV:1. Turn on the TV.2. Hit the HOME button to be able to choose non-TV2. Select Netflix. (All this time listening to whatever annoying show is on. It does seem to remember the previous channel. Before I got an antenna, there was loud static at this point.3. Discover that the TV's not connected to the internet4. Navigate back to Settings, Navigate to Internet, connect5. Sometimes, I have to enter my network password again7. Select Netflix again6. Navigate back to what I was watching before (e.g., if I'm working my way through a TV series), through the Netflix interface (which does not remember where I was in my Netflix queue and puts me back at the front)7. Select itI am sad that I spent as much money as I did on this set, and am crossing my fingers that they provide software or firmware upgrades to fix these things.

The small set in the basement using a Roku has no troubles (and the router is up here, in the living room)b. The router hasn't caused me any trouble for our heavy internet use (e.g., my son is a gamer)Update: I dug up an ethernet cable, so I'm just not using the wireless now. A better idea for me anyway. And yes, I don't lose the internet any longer. Hah... I spoke too soon.

I had to have a 32\" TV, 1080p, LED with wireless capabilities. Having 3D was a nice bonus. Having smart apps was another nice bonus. No one had all this, as of early 2012, but Amazon!Wows:1. The picture is fabulous, even if the channel is not HD. The Picture wizard offers many configurations to suit the viewer's taste.2. Display adjusts automatically to lighting conditions, making it easier on the eyes.3. Viewing angle is quite large.4. Beat sound is fabulous and the volume range is huge.5. True voice: This feature isolates human voice from background noise such that you hear what people are saying clearly.6. Energy savings: The TV will shut off automatically after a period of inactivity  when input source is not the TV.7. RGB port: I was planning on hooking up my computer to this TV using HDMI. That didn't work. So, it was a good thing that the TV has an RGB input.8. 3D glasses are not only cool but they are also very simple. They need no batteries and they do the job flawlessly.Drawbacks:1. Stand: As elegant as it is, it requires that you nail it to the entertainment center or else the TV may tip over.2. Magic remote: As slick as it is, it is severely lacking in buttons! It should have all of the following:(a) A full numeric keypad for channel number entry, including a dash for lengthy cable and satellite channel numbers.(b) A full letter keyboard for using the smart TV features, such as the web browser.(c) Input source button to quickly cycle through defined input sources. I use \"TV\" and \"Computer\" all the time. It would have been very user friendly if I could change input source with one click.LG has realized this major flaw and offers a much better remote with its Google TV. Unfortunately, LG has no plans of offering the same for this TV :-(The remote is also very irritating in that it requires that you move it around in order to see the cursor. A button would be a better idea. And that cursor quickly disappears, so you have to keep moving it. A button should be used for cursor show/hide.Another irritating behavior of the remote is that sometimes the cursor movement is jerky and may not move to where you want it no matter how far and hard you try!3. No output ports: All ports are input only. This means that I cannot record anything, not even to my LG DVD recorder.4. Component ports: I prefer composite, since it's more common. It's also what my LG DVD recorder supports.5. Position of ports: All USB and HDMI ports are on the side. This makes connecting HDMI cables quite difficult when the TV is placed inside an entertainment center. In addition, the cables look ugly. Having those ports on the back would be much better.6. Narrow swivel: 10 degrees is hardly enough to gain access to the side ports, especially if the TV is placed inside an entertainment center.7. The \"No Input\" error dialog: When the TV loses information on input source, it displays a dumb error dialog with two options: (a) Input List and (b) Close. It is much more user friendly to display the input list and save the user a click.8. No webcam: A webcam for Skype is an external device you can buy. It should be built-in.9. Sound sometimes goes away. I read that this is common in all smart TVs, but it could be a problem with my cable provider.10. Only one receiver port: I wanted to connect both my cable and my digital antenna, but there is only one receiver port. So, I had to get an A/B switch.11. Daylight savings is incorrectly implemented for the USA. I have to change the clock manually. As a result, all the program information accompanying the channel info bar is off by an hour!Wish:1. Picture-in-picture: I'd like a mini TV area to be available on demand when the input source is not the TV. This would come handy when I'm ordering something online after watching it on TV. A mini TV area is already implemented in the Home screen, so I know this can be done.2.

I have hooked up all four HDMI connetors, as well as, component video. I have hooked up the Digital Audio to some speakers with blasting power. So far, most things have been great. The picture in 2D is great with no blur, fuzziness, lagging, etc. A few people have reviewed the TV, and report blur in scenes with rapid changes.... I have not seen this issue.The TV works great with 3D content, also using the passive 3D glasses. The picture looks as good as the active glasses Sony TVs I've watched in 3D, which, by the way gives me headaches because I am able to see the flickering created by the active glasses. This, at least, I am susceptible to.... some people are not. I don't have this issue with passive 3D glasses. This TV can create 3D content from 2D content any time I wish. I'd say that 70% of the time it works out great and is worth watching in this \"fake\" 3D. The other times the effect is there, but not worth the bother because of the content. Animation looks particularly good in \"fake\" 3D.All my HDMI connected items work great with the TV. I use the component connected DVD to use subtitles when watching Spanish TV. Subtitles won't transmit through HDMI from a recording on a DVD HDD recorder, unfortunately.Connecting my Wifi was easy and has never lost a connection once hooked up. I subscribe to Hulu Plus and Netflix and sometimes go through the Wifi router to this TV. I also have a Roku device that is connected to the TV by HDMI. This connection works flawlessly.PROS:Easy hookup.Picture is great if you take the time to set the parameters, since the way it comes from the factory is less than the potential of the picture. There is a reviewer here at Amazon, who has done the calibration really well and setting the parameters like his will be a great starting point... you can see wrinkles on your favorite movie stars if you want.

The 120 HZ is adequate.3D is great with the nice light-weight passive glasses.\"Fake\" 3D is great with most content.I've never lost the Wifi signal, or any HDMI inputs.Digital audio is great.CONS:The speakers on the TV are mostly of treble quality and not bass. Full volume is okay for a medium living room with no noise. You may need the digital signal with some amplifiers to get the bigger sound.The remote really is horrible in design. The rounded, gun type remote is more comfortable falling over and remaining upside down. As it falls upside down, it clicks all sorts of buttons and changes everything I've been watching, so it needs constant attention. It really is a pain using it on Hulu Plus as it just does not behave properly when using forward or reverse or going screen to screen. Whenever I use Hulu Plus, I instead, turn on my Roku device hooked to a HDMI and use the Roku remote. It works much better with the Roku device remote. The remote from the TV is a constant pain with the cursor vanishing when I want to use it, and severely slows things down when I watch and want to cruise around the TV.Another feature that does not work at all is the TV guide that is built in. In other words, if on a channel, I want to know what is coming up, I can click a forward button progressively to see what will be on TV later. This works fine, but if I am on a channel and want to see what is on  another channel (this is set-up to work this way), it will not work and just says there is not information available. I have all the updates and none has fixed this issue.

Picture quality is great and sound is the same.  I was a bit leery about the remote, but have come to like it a lot.A few things to note:1.  When I first got it, the volume seemed to fluctuate a bit.  I had it on \"10\" one day which gave me a comfortable volume.  The next day, I had to put it on \"14\" to get the same level.  Not a big deal, but this went on for a couple weeks.  Everything has since settled out and I'm happy with it.  Not sure it was a software update that corrected things, but it's good now.2.  Sometimes with quick motion I notice \"blurring\".  That's probably not the best term for it, but I don't know what is.  This may be the TruMotion setting or something else, but I haven't really done much to correct it.  It doesn't happen that often and doesn't annoy me enough to go on a mission to figure it out.3.  If you have an older stereo/home theater system, expect that you may have to upgrade.  This TV has plenty of ports, but mostly newer ones that aren't on older audio equipment.  I cobbled something together to make things work with my system, but I will probably upgrade over the next year.Overall, great TV and I plan to buy another LG for my bedroom shortly.", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "So far, so good...", "Author": "ALBERTO ZUNIGA S.", "ReviewID": "R1OCJM93JINVBF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought it for the smart features; however, as at today I am Ok with it.

I just received it yesterday and have spent about 8 hours of viewing time with it. The set has excellent contrast with very deep blacks and a very crisp picture. LG's decision to offer passive 3D technology was a sound one. The effect is very good and I was able to purchase 6 additional glasses (it comes with 6 pairs) for around $40. Even more impressive is LG's ability to create a 3D effect from a standard 2D picture source. Of course it doesn't rival original 3D content but it is impressive. That said I don't think I'll be using that very much because putting on 3D glasses is not something I would want to do just to watch standard content. I previously had a Samsung 55\" 2D LED set and this LG is every bit as good as the Samsung was. I decided not to go with Samsung for the upgrade because of the higher price and the fact that Samsung uses active 3D which means expensive glasses and keeping the batteries charged in the glasses. Too much of a hassle. Overall I would strongly recommend this set, at least the 65\" version.Update: It's been 10 days and I am still extremely happy with the performance of this set. In addition I ran across this technical review where they absolutely state that LG has the best 3D system of any and why it is the only 3D technology where eye strain and 3D cross-talk are absolutely the the lowest they have tested. Not sure if Amazon allows URLs in their reviews but if they remove it you can go to televisioninfo dot com and search for 47LM6700 and jump to the 3D section of the review. Really eye-opening!

It sounds great, it isn't broke, so I am not replacing it.  The HD cable box (and blu ray) are both hooked up to the TV via HDMI.  If I use the optical out from the TV to the tuner...  It does a PCM signal and NOT a full dolby digital signal.  Really makes no sense that it can't output a digital signal.  So I have to jostle cables around to get the best sound out of everything.  A bit annoying, but rare as the cable box and blu ray are both going directly in.

I have been playing Assassin's Creed Revelations in 3D on this thinking I would get bored and go back to 2D pretty fast but not so! The 3D is incredible! And the scale up feature is also pretty good. The only time it has problems is in a dark environment with very bright areas where the dark areas appear too far in the background. Maybe someone else could fix this tweaking with settings (there are A LOT to tweak!) It works great with the PS3 with no notable artifacts and as a 2D TV it is one of the best pictures I have seen.The true motion is in my opinion awesome but I know some people are put off by the hyper-real feeling. You can disengage it or even tune it to be less obtrusive if you wish though. I can't properly assess the Dual-Play feature as I don't have the right glasses yet other than to say it does work, but with a caveat....

It arrived yesterday (2 days after purchasing it).  It arrived in excellent condition.  As I am over 60 years old and live alone, I was somewhat concerned about putting this together and lifting it on to the TV stand.  It is large but not as heavy as my older 32 inch TV.  I laid the box on my  coffee table face down, cut the back off the box and screwed the stand into place. From the height of the coffee table I was able to lift it upright and carry it to the TV stand.  Voila!  One 47 inch TV in place (and I was only slightly out of breath!)Things to know:  1)  The instructions that come with the TV are almost worthless.  LG surely can afford to put out a better manual for this lovely TV, especially since  most people buying it are new to using a 3D TV.  2) You need to use special cables to hook up to the cable, DVD, XBox, Roku etc.  Fortunately, I purchased A high speed HDMI cable w/ethernet cable that is meant to be used with a 3D TV.  So I could enjoy my new TV yesterday evening.  Last night I ordered 3 more cables so I can hook up the rest of my electronics.  3) The new style remote takes some getting used to but I really love it.  4) The TV arrived with 6 pairs of glasses.  As this is what's termed \"passive\" 3D, these glasses are very light weight -- just like putting on a pair of sunglasses.  I actually forgot to take them off when I was watching regular HD TV.  It is nice to know that I can have 3D and not have to wear those bulky, expensive glasses.  5) You can actually see regular TV and movies  with this TV in what I would call a modified 3D which was kind of nice.So, I am very happy with my purchase.  I'm glad that I have waited for this product.  It's a great buy!  Now, I'm going back into the TV room to watch some 3D!", "Date": "August 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Television", "Author": "sivad99", "ReviewID": "RHPH3L2LLIWQ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I found this t.v. at one of the big electronics store and then went online to check the price at Amazon.com and saved around $150.

I've enjoyed accessing YouTube and Netflix, and it's great.I've been an LG fan for awhile. My blu-ray players are LG, so I'm used to the LG presentation and navigation for YouTube and apps. For the settings, if you've ever played Wii games, you know about pointing the remote and then selecting. It's extremely simple to learn.The 3D experience in my estimation beats alternatives because this type of battery-free glasses is easier on the eyes and it's as good as movie theater 3D quality.Finally, I think the value is outstanding, especially compared to where this market was at the end of last year.

Buying it from Amazon will add additional value to your product with their excellent service all around.  I am very glad that LG & Amazon combination worked out so well.  This TV has many features built in which will probably need a longer review than one could possibly end with including mine, but i will try to summarize the key features by sections which might help people who are looking forward to get one.  Before I start,  I believe most of you would have considered a higher version of this model 47LM6700, the only difference between this 47LM6200 and 47LM6700 is the Dynamic contrast ratio which you would barely notice for a regular viewing usage.  Lets explore the Key featuresWIDI ( Wireless Display Ability )This Feature would appear very forward for many, prehaps not many would even be aware of this too. But this is definitely a good to have feature which will get rid of the messy cables from your laptop to TV including the HDMI.  Not to forget your laptop should a Wireless display feature from Intel or your graphics adapter manufacturer which will enable your laptop to stream audio and video wirelessly.. Yes no HDMI :)  I am yet to test this feature as I dont have a WIDI ready laptop available with me right now, but very soon I will.  Imagine how easy it would be to sit on a couch and stream your webpage or media with a mouse click or a Key stroke, without any argument its nice.  ( Not many TV has this feature inbuilt in the same class )3D ( Passive )Comes with 6 3D glasses and you absolutely dont have to shop for anything more than what you get with this tv for 3D viewing.  The color saturation produced by this tv in 3D TV appears much more real than any other TV which i tried.  With the right amount of depth and correct image adjustments you will get the best 3D projection out of this tv. Nothing to complain at all.Picture QualityI am personally no fan of Local dimming feature which in fact annoys me most of the time.  This set has the best combination of viewing modes you would be in need of , not in short not in excess, just the perfect modes.  Though you may need to calilbrate most of the settings to get the best out, the menus are much intiutive and you wont spend more than 10 minutes to get the best out to suit your taste.  Overall the Vivid mode produced brilliant colors than anything I tried with Trumotion set to Off, pictures cant get more relaisitc than what this one produces.  Hatsoff to LG for their amazing research and continuous improvements. Dont judge the quality of the LED/LCD tv's by the amount of contrast and lighting they deliver which may make your viewing experience look highly unrealistic and life less.SoundJust one suggestion, get a home theatre or surround bar.  Its cruel to expect a slim panel to scream loud :) The trade off here is very obvious where any one complains at it may have to look at how bulky tv bose manufactured to sound better :) LG 47LM6200 47-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 120Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV and Six Pairs of 3D GlassesViewing ComfortThis is one of the most important aspect considering how bright LED's can get to harm your eyes.  Some people claim samsung produces better contrast ratio than any other manufacturer but its very evident the longer you spend your time with Samsung TV's the strain you put on your eyes are high, especially when viewing in dark.  LG even has a setting to take care of that , Eye care.  Turn it on and it automatically adjust the amount of contrast in terms of the white level to put less strain on your eyes and for longer viewing comfort.RemoteI am not a big fan of magic motion remote.  I personally feel Magic motion remote should be a supplement to the mainstream full functional remote. One thing which is more annoying with Magic motion remote is that the appearance of cursor on screen even if the move with your remote is unintentional.  I agree its great when you use the smart TV feature where typing in the keys are much easier with hovering the cursor over than using the mainstream remote, but for normal usage i personally feel the conventional remote tops. I Did ordered a OEM remote from amazon which I tried in the past with 47LM6700 and it worked flawless.DesignWith right amount of bezel, you cannot go wrong with this stunning design.  LG did a awesome lot of work in redesigning the looks of TV, especially the stand.  You will never miss a guest from not noticing it :)Overall, I would personally recommend this tv to anyone who is looking for a exceptional picture quality at reasonable price.

I have used Sony, Toshiba and Panasonic in the past. I love my Sony Bravia XBR6 and I still have it. I wanted a TV with 3D and less than 46 inch. In normal cases, I would go and buy Sony but Sony does not provide this size in 3D so I have to do my homework :(. I compared features and cost and then I went to local electronic stores and focused on Panasonic, LG and Samsung models. My initial preference was Samsung. But then I read many more reviews on web about different TVs including these on Amazon. So in came the 'Life is Good'. I can compare now Sony XBR6 and this TV side by side, that may not be fair since Sony cost me over 2K when I purchased it. But I am comparing it because Sony quality is my bottom line for the picture. Sony is very very close to Samsung quality when I checked them in stores.The packaging is good and TV looked good when I opened it. It is light and slim. Installing the stand and connections were piece of cake. Setting up wireless s connection was breeze and the first thing I did was to update the firmware. The magic remote was cool, my daughter goes \"Never seen any remote like this before\".Then comes the picture test. For that, I have HD signal from my Dish. My first reaction was \"I am returning this TV\". The color looked bad. Picture not that sharp and motion kinda blurred. Then I changed the settopbox to 720p and things improved a little bit. Remember I had my XBR6 is connected to settopbox with 1080i and it gave amazing picture. The sound is certainly better than Sony but I have external speakers so I don't really care.Connecting blueray player and playing animation was better but it still did not reach the Sony quality. Then I played for many hours with the TV controls .. color, sharpness, contrast..checked online blogs... Well, to make the story short, I was able to reach a lot better picture quality after making changes to default settings. This on a Dish 1080i signal. For Dish, ipad videos, Sony still shows a little better quality. When you play a low quality youtube video, Sony renders it with much better clarity and smoothness. Online paid or good quality videos are fine. For BD movies though, they are nearly equal.  The black color or dark scenes are better on Sony. Some scenes can be easily changed so my advice is that  if you have this TV, be prepared to play with controls initially.. a lot.I was able to utilize ARC HDMI on this TV for the VCR. I have VCR connected to TV via component cable. This means that TV gets the audio signal from VCR but it passes back to the receiver where I can use external speakers. For some reason, they have provided weird cables for RCA and component inputs that need to be used with your normal cables. It works fine and the quality on those inputs is OK - again, Sony is better. The youtube, Netflix works as expected although I was a little disappointed that LG does not have the Amazon Prime.  LG has smartshare where it can play content from PC, tablets, phone. It recognized my Home PC but not able to access it, I think it has to do something with windows media sharing. I contacted LG. They were quick to respond but the issue is not yet resolved. I think it will be.Now the best part, 3D is phenomenal. Of course 2D to 3D conversion does not give justice to the 3D picture. I saw 3D blueray 'under the sea' on this and was blown away. The kids actually jumped on the seat when the ocean-snake hisses from the screen. Amazing... Waiting for the Avatar 3D and Avengers 3D coming soon.Do your research and you will find for the cost you are paying, LG is giving most features amongst its competitors. So, as you see, I am not completely satisfied with its quality but I give 5 stars.", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good picture but the TV has some issues", "Author": "M.L.", "ReviewID": "R3FMCOI59CAH9G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "UPDATE: 8/13 - The latest update has fixed the restart issue.  It has been a week without the issue (Knock on Wood).  If the issue stays away I will update my star ratingsI have owned the TV for around 3 months now.  The television is a mixed bag.My Rating is 3 1/2 stars but Amazon does not have the 1/2 star option.  I will cover the negative portion first.The TV reboots itself at least once every time we watch TV on it.  The problems occurs when the TV does not respond to remote commands (Changing the volume)  You will try to change the volume but the TV does nothing and then within 10 seconds the TV reboots itself.  It occurs with the LG remote and with our cable TV remote that is setup to control the TV. It is possible I got a lemon and the software update that was released at the end of June did not fix the issue.The remote that comes with the TV is a love/hate remote.  The remote operates very similar to a WII remote, which is a pain for basic functions for controlling the TV.  The remote is good for the SmartTV portion of the tv for browsing the web and selecting the apps.  I prefer a full keyboard that comes with a Google TV.  I also own a Google TV.The Led is strong at night.  When the room is dark it looks someone is using a flashlight from different angles on the sides of the TV.Now for the positives.Passive 3D.  I already own an active and passive 3D televisions. Passive is the same technology they use at the movie theater.  While I believe the 3D is better on a active TV. The problem with active are the glasses and the eye strain I get from active 3D.  The passive 3D solved both issues for me with only a slight degradation in 3D quality. The TV will also take a 2D channel and make it 3D; however, there is a definite bend to the picture around the edges.The the colors are crisp and clear. The blacks are not true black but it is not noticeable unless are trying to look for it.The apps selection is great but the best feature is that I can natively connect to my Plex media server.  Though it does have issues with my Bluray quality videos.  It has the typical Netflix / Amazon Video and other apps that are often seen with Smart TVsAnother nice feature is the support of flash. I can watch my training video from lynda.com.I am on the fence, whether I would recommend this TV to family or friends.

The setup was a breeze, took me under 10 minutes, and it was ready for me to watch live TV, media from my storage devices, and use the internet apps (YouTube, NetFlix, Facebook, Twitter).Now I am one of those who watch videos on YouTube a lot! I haven't tried any of the other premium apps yet, but the YouTube app is horrendous - I haven't been able to watch a single video with proper Audio-Video sync, and I haven't been able to watch any video longer than 8 minutes - for longer videos, the application appears to get overwhelmed by the amount of data it has downloaded, capitulates, and crashes. For instance, when I tried to watch \"jozTK-MqEXQ\" on YouTube, which is about 47 minutes long, the app crashed after about 33 seconds, and the TV stopped responding. I had to restart the TV to get it back working.You might say that it is the low internet speed to blame, but it is not because the TV is connected through an Ethernet cable to an internet connection that serves my laptop, my phone and my tablet (HP Touchpad) and none of them complain about low internet speed. I have the 35mbps Comcast plan. So it is definitely YouTube app - and since it is my primary use for the TV, I am completely disappointed.Pros:1. Nice screen.2. Good looks.3. Plays a large variety of video formats (from the connected HDD).4. 3D is pretty impressive.Cons:1. The apps are poor - the YouTube app is horrible, absolutely useless for all practical purposes.2. The Wi-like remote is a pain to use, specially when you have to input text.3. No useful apps in the marketplace. I have gone there about 10 times, and never installed any because none of them is any good.4. The UI isn't anything to write home about. I have mixed feelings towards its home screen.So, if you are looking for a functional smart TV, I'd suggest you to look for another one.

This is what they explicitly wrote to me in response to my inquiring as to why I couldn't get any sound from my JUST Pandora web site on the TVs browser (that pandora required a newer version of flash and their TV would never (could not) support it.Taking them at their word, the obvious thought is that going forward it's reasonable to assume more sites will require newer versions of flash and so the problem will get worse.Note, I find their answer  hard to believe.  The TV is a computer and they control the OS so, as  software engineer, this seems absurd...but hey, that's what they wrote.2) Not a good choice if you have an old receiver (or preamp/amp setup).  There's one component and one composite input.  There's No analog audio out.  So, if you have an older receiver without a remote you can't use the TVs volume control to control the volume as your receiver won't have HDMI and if you have optical (tosc) sound the TV will not control the volume of tosc.  Note you can buy a $40 tosc to composite out from radioshack but no volume control.Maybe in the scheme of things buying a modern receiver is inevitable but just be aware.  That's could be a bit of money and if you want to go pure HDMI/Smrtlink, that could mean upgrading your DVD or whatever too3) Their web browser is annoying.

You can save hundreds by searching online (not sure Amazon will like this). This 2012 LM series is quite an upgrade from the LX's. The image quality is just a little better. It's true that Standard resolution upscaling can be improved mainly by using the Picture Wizard. It takes a little patience and tweaking but it will pay off. A big improvement from previous models. The biggest improvement is on the Smart TV features and WI FI configuration. Everything goes here. I was very concerned with the glossy screen and it turned out to be quiet nice. The reflection is not an issue if you don't have a big light source behind you. If you have big windows opposite of the TV just use shades and drapes.The size of the screen is just perfect. What I mean is that originally I had a 47\" and it kinda got lost in front of me then I replaced it with a 55\" and it still looked lost, then I got the 65\" and that was it. I feel like I'm in a movie theater. I have this set in my bedroom in front of the bed a distance of 9 feet which is OK. I will suggest a distance of at least 10 feet for 3d viewing. Nine feet is OK but a little straining on the eyes. With time the eyes will adjust.The 3d feature is just the same as previous models with the exception of automatically detecting and turning on the stereo effect mainly in games. Another big improvement is the Magic Remote. This set came with only one remote and I was quite disappointed but after trying out the new Magic Remote found out that the regular one was not needed.The good news for PC gamers is that those who use NVidea 3d TV Play software for video games can use it with this LM6200 set. Mind you that not all brand models are compatible. This set is not listed as compatible (not tested) and I took a big gamble but to my surprise it was supported. Tri Def 3d software is more forgiving where you just set it as Standard Type and it will work just fine. The problem with these games is that most of them offer a 1280 x 720 60 Hz resolution for supported 3d. Very few will offer the 1920 x 1080 24 Hz support.Games, set at the 1080p will look great on this set but the 720p will look degraded which is the majority. Mainly because the screen size. It looks acceptable but no way like the 1080ps. There is no improvement on the 2d to 3d conversion. This thing kind of grows on you, is like acquiring taste, after a while you will get accustomed to the effect which is different from real 3d. But good none the less. It adds more visual information than a flat 2d screen with depth. Looks real good in open areas. At first impression I didn't like it because I was expecting too much. It took me months to finally accept it and start appreciating it.Overall after a week of test driving it and for the price I paid I'm happier than a dog with 3 tails. It takes a while to get used to the new screen size especially when you upgrade from smaller sizes. I'll give it 8 stars.

Right off the bat, the colors, size, contrast and everything except input lag was so much better. Even on game mode, this tv has a bit of lag to it that's really noticeable next to a TN based monitor moving the windows around. It may not be the best for games like guitar hero or the like if you're playing video games that are critical for button presses. Movies, casual gaming, and web test is much easier to deal with over the TN monitors. However, reading red text on a black background on this tv is blurry. Something to do with the pixel ratio or something. Blacks aren't as great as a VA based tv, IPS produces a glow effect that simulates backlight bleeding. If you move your head, the bleed will move too. The stand is really great, you can place things in that little area. With the stand, it's fairly light. About the same as a 24\" standard non LED monitor. Touch sensitive buttons on the front aren't that great if you have things around the buttons. I have my keyboard up there to the right and rarely hit the off button, more so when I turn off the TV, I hit another button that selects Input. There is no bump above the buttons to let you know what number button you're on to hit. Like an older tv with actual buttons, you slide your finger across them and know what button is what by counting them. All of these are touch sensitive and if you slide your finger then you're going to a bit of hassle once in a while.The apps are great, I use the Fios app and don't have a problem. Can select on demand too. Pairing your phone to watch youtube is nice as well. Bezel is non gloss, and has a nice texture to it. No fingerprints to worry about except on the stand which is gloss. Screen is semi gloss, more on the glossy side though, but not entirely glossy like a plasma or higher end sony or samsung.

Very irritating to type with when having to re-enter the same settings over and over.The re-entering of settings was fixed when the tech came out to force the TV to download the current firmware. When I received the TV I let it check for and download all updates. The TV said it had the latest version according to the LG website. However the tech said the firmware did not actually install as he was looking at screens only available in the master menu (not accessible by the consumer). After re-downloading the latest firmware, aloof the memory problems disappeared and the TV paired with smart devices (so much better for typing in account info). He stated LG routinely updates it's firmware as contracts with premium providers change; the old version of the app may not work with the new settings from the premium app provider. Given this, I am not confident the TV will successfully update everytime over the next several years without calling out a tech and paying a costly fee for something that the TV should do on its own.About LG support...called in three times before they would send a tech out. Three times, I got a different answer on why things weren't working.  The rep would place me on hold to \"talk to the engineers\". Each time it took exactly 4 minutes to not provide an answer the first response was 'we are aware and working it.  So very sorry.'. Next it was, 'that feature is not supported' despite the first phone call on the same issue saying it was and the LG website saying it was and the owners manual saying it was. The third time I overwhelmed them with all of the issues I had discovered in a week, they agreed to send a tech.Do not recommend. Tech support lacks integrity and with the updates a smart TV needs, who knows when LG will dump the support for this model to try and force customers to buy the current version. My first and may be my last smart TV. This had not occurred to me before talking to the tech who came to do the repair.", "Date": "March 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG products", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R24OFC8PEAACWJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really enjoy my new tv.

It has been great. Super easy to use, great picture quality, so many features that every day it does or has something new that impresses me.  I read a lot of complaints about the Magic Remote, you don't have to set anything up on it, it works out of the box, I would relate it most to using a WII remote with your TV instead of a traditional remote.  The 3D was interesting: you can convert anything you are watching into 3D with the push of a button, I would say the results are moderate.  It has a 3D channel on it where you can download/rent 3D movies, and watch free 3D trailers.  The movies that are intentionally made to be 3D are awesome, but the converted stuff is just OK.  The glasses are comfortable to wear.  It seems that the Pixar/children's movies seem to show best in the made for 3D.  It has built in Wi-Fi, which is super easy to set-up, no wires or adapters needed.  When on the Wi-Fi, on select smartphones such as the Galaxy S3, you can link the devices and the TV will act as a monitor to display you pictures and videos wirelessly through the Wi-Fi connection.  Very cool! You can go online through the TV; we watched videos off of YouTube's 3D channel.  The screen auto-adjusts its brightness based on the lighting in your room - sunny day verses night time. The only cons: it reads USB flash drive sticks, but does not read external hard drives from the USB ports.  Doesn't have a built in 3D DVD player so you have to buy a separate 3D DVD Player unit.

Some visual probs I had with some movies at first pixel probs and motion blur.  I hooked it up to my HTS 1700 stage 2 HD Monster Power conditioner and that helped. Plus also hooked up my Xbox 360 to it with my new Monster ISF 1250 HDMI cable that I upgraded to.... Did not like the power cord that came with the TV so I upgraded that to an Audioquest NRG - 1 power cord. On one note spend some time using the Picture Wizard 2, or a calibration cd for the best picture.... this TV does take some tweaking with the settings to get the best picture so take some time to do this... The 32 inch did come with a Magic Remote and I love it. It is new and innovative as well as easy to use. The 3D is out of this world. You can customize the depth and look of the 3D with a good amount of adjustments, this is great.  With the upgrades in HDMI and power cables the picture settled in nice. With True Motion set to smooth I got no motion blur or pixel probs at ALL! WOW! Smooth as silk!!  The Avengers, Captain America, and my Dukes of Hazard DVDs looked amazing!  I am very anal about my picture let me tell you.  You need a good high end HDMI cable for this TV and the power cord upgrade made a difference as well.  The power cord that came with the TV did not seem to click into place like the new Audioquest power cord did and I did see a difference in performance when I upgraded for sure.  I always use top of the line cables and power conditioners to maximize and protect my investments. The DVD's look great up scaled to 1080p by my Xbox 360. The 2D to 3D conversion is great when watching movies and playing Xbox games!!  I have FEAR 2 and Crysis for the Xbox and they LOOKED AMAZING when I cranked up the 3D settings!! Wow!  When I am done playing I feel like I have to come back down to earth... lol. Love the 3D glasses as well they fit nice. I will not always use the 3D but it is nice once in a while.  The passive 3D is the way to go. I did not need the 3D aspect of this TV but for the price why not.  The 2D looks very sharp and clean and is a great upgrade from my old LG 120hz LCD TV. What a picture!! The sound is nice as well for a TV so thin, this TV is a bit thinner that my old LCD. Love the look of this unit as well, its all about style.. says Iron Man.... lol. ............... all in all great TV for price... can't beat LG for best TV to price ratio and I did about 4 months of research. Again I recommend a high end ISF Monster HDMI cable for this TV.  Trust me I tried a few and not the same result at all. Spend time tweaking with the Picture Wizard 2 or calibration cd....... AWESOME TV FRO THE PRICE! Thanks LG!!  If you are an Xbox 360 guy... GET THIS TV!!Pros: Magic Remote  3D adjustments  Passive 3D  2D Picture quality  Performance 2D/3D/Sound  The look of the TV and stand  Lots of nice adjustments  Lots of other online features that I don't use but are nice just in case.cons: Do not like power cord it came with  Do not like the location of the HDMI slots on the side  Wish it had stereo headphone out jackWell have fun and remember please don't drink and drive..... be safe..

The 3D is amazing and the sound is way beyond expectations. Of all the reviews I have read it seems people complain about the sound from most LED TV's. There is no issue at all with the volumn on this one!

It is also worth mentioning that the built-in upscaler works very well and makes 720p content look fantastic, so if you're playing games with your Xbox 360 you're probably better off setting the system to always output in 720p.The built-in WiFi works well on 2.4GHz and 5GHz 802.11n and the ambient light sensor is convenient although requires a bit of tweaking in the settings for optimal performance. The TV also apparently has built in Intel WiDi support although I have not tested this feature yet. The smart TV functions while sort of redundant if you're already connecting a PC or game console, are a nice bonus. The SmartLink functions also work with the PS3 so you can control the system with the included TV remote.The only real cons are not specific to this TV but pretty much all new HDTVs in this class, the lack of multiple traditional inputs like S-Video, composite, and component, as well as the complete lack of analog audio outputs like 3.5mm or RCA. The TV remote itself is a bit odd but it actually functions pretty well despite the Wii-mote like user experience. I do however wish that LG had included an input button on it, as navigating through the onscreen menu is less intuitive than pressing a button a few times. The Android App for this TV also works so you can also use your smart phone as a TV remote.The TV also feels very solid, is pretty thin, and has a nice looking stand. The power cable is removable so a longer cable can easily be plugged in if needed, as it is just a standard IEC C7 A/C power cable. The front buttons are all capacitive which looks nice, although this feature does not really add any functionality. There are plenty of HDMI ports but there is only 1 composite/component input and both require adapters. If using the component input you cannot use composite as the composite port becomes dedicated to audio.If you're looking for a new 32\" TV and don't mind spending more than a few hundred dollars this is a great TV.", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Buy!", "Author": "Jamar Everett", "ReviewID": "R29FSKZ4K2EHIJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research on comparable televisions before settling on this one.

The picture quality in 2D is very good.  So I tried the 3D (using the SmartTV to download some material since I don't have a 3D blu-ray yet) and while I was playing the 3D, I noticed very definite pixelizations during some of the activity.  The 3D imagery was good, but not great.  The set came with 4 HDMI inputs and 6 pairs of 3D glasses so there is not complaint there.Now some of the things I did not like was that I was replacing a smaller, 26 inch HDTV set that could support 3 HDMI inputs and 2 composite inputs (and two, I think) component inputs and much to my surprise (I should have checked this more thoroughly), the LG had only 1 composite and 1 component input each.  Since my previous setup used both of the composite inputs, I now have to figure out how to replace or gerry-rig a second composite input.  Drat!And the thing that I dislike most about this LG TV is the \"Magic\" remote control.  LG is evidently targeting this new LG HDTV for PC users as the Magic (there word not mine) remote only has a few keys on it and a battery eating feature to move a mouse-like cursor on the screen whenever you move the remote just right (side to side I think)!  Having become a long-time expert with a more traditional TV remote with many keys on it, it is taking me quite a long time to get used to this new, \"magic\" remote control.  To support the \"Magic\" remote, all of the frequently used functions (except for volume control and channel changing) require bringing up a menu, which turns on the cursor that you have to navigate to a Windows-like set of icons, to bring up another menu to do the things you want to do!  A real pain when all you might want to do is change to another input source, for instance, or change the Picture size like the 4x3 and 16x9 settings.  I can only hope that one of my universal remotes will be recognized by this new LG HDTV so that I can get back to a more familiar style of remote controlling via keys!Now that being said, I think the Magic remote control does have its place when you are using some of the SmartTV features on this HDTV, like the internet browser, but they definitely should rethink how the Magic remote works with the normal TV features.So because of my dislike of the Magic remote, I only give this LG HDTV three (3) stars.", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Joel A.

At first I seemed to have some issues, but that turned out to be on my cable providers side and not from the TV. Overall, I love this TV. The picture is great, it has a lot of features that are useful for me, and I'm just very happy I purchased it. Some specific things I enjoy most that I'd like to point out:- USB ports: Through the USB I play a lot of media. Fortunately, this TV seems to be able to play almost every video file I have. From avi to mkv I  haven't encountered a problem with it not playing a file (which is in contrast to my xbox which is much more picky about what it wants to play)- Streaming: I use the Plex Media that it encourages you to use. It works fairly well. Almost every file I stream works seamlessly, with the exception of a few 1080p files that are in excess of 20GB.- 3D: One of the reasons I bought this TV was for the 3D functionality. Mostly because I just wanted to try it out, not because I'm really that into 3D.  Most experts agree that tvs with 3D functionality generally have a better picture than those that do not and that played into my decision as well. The 2D  to 3D conversion is pretty cool. It works pretty well and is fun to play around with at times. Playing 3D movies themselves look great on this tv and I'm glad I have to option to do it now if I want.- Magic remote: I love this remote. It controls my TV and my cablebox so I don't need to use two remotes. I like the motion aspect as it's easier to navigate (for me) than older style remotes. This remote is awesome and makes it tough for me to go back to using a normal TV remote when controlling other tvs.Overall, the picture on the LG is great. I dialed it in using some files off the internet and I'm very satisfied with it. It has stunning clarity, is very sharp, and has the capabilities to easily dial in the picture through many different parameters. Though it doesn't have the deepest blacks, it hasn't bothered me to the point of really being annoyed. The only thing I don't like about this tv is it's lack of a headphone out where I could hook up my external speakers. As it is, there is only a digital audio out. You can fix this by buying a converter but it's somewhat inconvenient.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Thomas A.

The LG and Samsung were identically priced, but this had 1\" on the Samsung and 3D capability. While I wasn't really interested in whether or not the TV could do 3D going into the purchase, it was a nice extra feature and it made the deal for me.Stand/base assembly was quick and easy, and setup was a snap. I thought the idea of a Wii like remote was going to be kind of strange, but I've gotten used to it and it's actually quite nice to not have to mash buttons to go through all of the settings; the on screen cursor made life just that much easier. My only gripe here is the stand appears to be a little flimsy as the TV is easily wobbled when touched. I mean, it seems sturdy enough, I don't think it's going to just break on it's self and the solution to the wobble is simply to not touch the TV, so it's really not that big of a deal.The picture quality is quite amazing, and I was actually a little surprised at how much better it looks than my 4 yr old Toshiba. The second surprise was, it didn't look terrible out of the box, but I am slowly tweaking the picture settings to get it just right. I was a little worried about this not having local dimming, but \"flashlighting\" or bleeding hasn't been an issue. The 3D up-conversion is actually pretty cool and done well. The only issue that I've seen so far is while watching cable, there is an occasional stutter in the picture, like everything is in slow motion for 2-3 seconds. I've only watched on DVD so far and I didn't notice this stutter, but it could have happened... I just don't know if it's the TV, the cable service or the HDMI cable. Another plus is the viewing angle is much improved from my last set, and I'm very happy about that.Despite all of the negative things I've read about the on-board speakers, I found them to be acceptable, although this is really a moot point as most often, the sound is diverted to my receiver, even for casual viewing.Otherwise, wi-fi setup was painless - I just punched in the code and off I went. I haven't used the apps much, but I did poke around on Netflix a little and I really like how it's laid out. Much better interface than the Netflix app on my Blu Ray player. I also vied a few You Tube videos and all was well, so I'm sure the apps will not be a problem and Netflix will get used heavily.I can't really complain; this was priced rate, it's feature rich, it's larger than my old TV and it looks fantastic!

The magic remote works like a Nintendo Wii controller, except it has a mouse-like arrow on the screen. You have to point the remote at icons on the screen, then click a button, like using a mouse. The problem here is that 1) the motion isn't great, and requires lots of bending and acrobatics to get it pointed at the correct icon 2) every time the remote is moved or touched a big arrow appears on the screen, which is a pain if the remote is on the couch and somebody sits next to it, inadvertently causing the remote to move, nd 3) simple tasks like changing the input source are buried under multiple layers of nonsense. To change from my AppleTV to watching cable, first you have to press the Home button on the remote, then you have to point the remote at the input icon on the screen, then you have to point the remote at the correct icon on the screen depending on what source you want to watch. It is much easier to simply press the 'input' button on a remote. My wife is unable to change input sources. She hates this remote.", "Date": "September 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Between judder and image corruption", "Author": "Chi va Piano \"Va Sano\"", "ReviewID": "RMIVDI348DWL9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I use this TV set with a blu-ray player. First, the minor gripes:1) The remote control's ergonomics are simply bad. You'll know it when you see it.2) The sound is so low that you'll have to get a speaker. I got the very bad Bose solo speaker because it was the only one convenient for my TV room.And now the major gripe: I don't know about HZ (the screen sometimes shows 60) but clearly there are not enough of real HZ in this model. Simple: If you set \"tru-motion\" at anything less than 3, there is judder i.e. the image lacks continuity and smoothness. 3 is the \"smooth\" setting which removes the hiccups but introduces the full madness of the algorithm (maximum setting is 10) which attempts to insert frames in order to deal with judder, which really works only when there is no movement. But if there is say an actor  moving his head or crossing the screen, you will see his face and the rest distorted, with waves around the edge of the body.Stay away if you plan on using this set more often than occasionally, and with blu-raysMy set runs firmware 4.30.05", "Date": "June 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unbearable internet buffering, okay TV otherwise", "Author": "Aldenone", "ReviewID": "R2URXT5BAFDXUE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am wondering if this is a LG thing.

It's beautiful for gaming, and it turns any non-3D image into 3D on the fly (though there's some that just aren't meant for that.

It was small, and whenever I would play any newer games, the detail needed me to sit close to tell what's going on. So I saved up for Black Friday and saw this TV. It's LG, so you know it's going to be good, and with 3D coming Mainstream with console games, I felt if I was going to go for a TV, I better get the best for my dollar. It's the perfect size, and the look is exactly as you see it in the picture, it's shiny, smooth, and pleasing to see. There's 4 HDMI ports- Wii U, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and whatever else- Computer Screen, HD whatever, it's there.With it being a Smart TV, there's Apps for it. Built in is Wireless Internet so that means you get Netflix on the fly, or even games. The remote is a point and click, so you point at the TV, and there's a cursor. And let me tell you- there's nothing to the quality of this remote anywhere out there. It even recognizes it SIDEWAYS. You're laying down, and want to point at the TV and change the settings? No problem, you can literally point at your window and still navigate the TV. This is the best I've seen.I don't regret this purchase, it's fantastic quality, and I would recommend it to anyone- it's extremely fun too for Tech-savvy people too, a lot to play around with with Screen Sharing, Network connectivity, and accessing files on your machines.10/10 would recommend.", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Compatible with Netflix Streaming", "Author": "Tony Arnold", "ReviewID": "RR9347NAJKBHE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This item functions as well as any other flat screen for cable TV & DVDs, but don't try to set up Netflix streaming.

The 3D is as good as you will see at any theater.  The remote is not good but we can learn to adapt.  One star was because out of the box the TV reboots about once an hour on good days every three hours.  LG has been responsive and came out to replace the power supply.  20 minutes later it rebooted.  They want to come back to replace the boards.  There are three.  I would like Amazon to swap me for one that's not a lemon but they don't have any in stock and it's not clear when they will.  That should be a warning.  When all the units are used or through external vendors red flag.  So sad to see it go back.  LG looks to have a real looser with the entire 6200 product line regardless of size.  Look at the other reviews.  I want this to work but it does not and for $2K it should without swapping all the guts.  Be vary careful if you are considering purchasing any of the 6200 line.  I would only go with Amazon - they watch your back.1/3/2012 - Update - Amazon gave me until 1/31 to return the set.  LG has been out here 4 times.  They swapped every board, cable and finally the screen.  The day before they swapped the screen a software update came down.  We will never know if it was the screen or the software update but the darn thing works perfectly.  An amazing picture and great 3D.  Very disappointed at first (as evident from my first post) - it should have worked.  But LG and Amazon stood behind their product and service.  LG was committed to make it work and I had Amazon as a backstop.  LG came through.  Got to know the repair guy well from all his trips out.  He was professional and knew his stuff.  I'll be going back to LG and Amazon - good combination.  I've upped the rating to 5 stars.  Something I didn't learn until the last trip out was that LG was going to swap the unit if this last change didn't fix it.

All in one. Fast forward to the 21st century and here we go again. After 40 years of consumer electronics being bought and sold ala-carte, LG, among other manufacturers is putting today's gadgets and gidgets in one happy package. More or less.The first thing I noticed when getting into the box was the remote. Not much to it beyond your basic on and off function, volume, channel changer and a couple of quick-to's that take you to the screen. This remote is actually (stay with me) a glorified mouse. Complete with curser on the screen.. Point and click to the functions you see on the screen. There's a ton of them too.Initial setup was pretty easy. No big deal. The external jacks are located on the upper back side of the unit..I dont get that. Why not just put them across the bottom to allow for less cable lengths and corners?  About the externals...Our old standby the RCA plug is history. If you have an older audio unit that you're hooking into, you can't, at least directly from the TV. It's all through fiber optic inputs/outputs and you'll need to accommodate for that. 4 HDMI inputs is nice.Another underwhelming thing is (and I cant believe I'm writing this) is the operation manual. After several pages warning you not to stick your tongue in an electrical socket, its mostly a few pages of the most basic of basics in setup. It gets you up and running but that's about it. The rest is on-screen for you to dig through and find.So what about the picture and sound? After a few adjustments and refining, the picture is jaw dropping incredible. That's coming from someone who graduated from an LG LCD unit.  The sound however is.....only adequate. It wont rattle your teeth or the dishes in the kitchen. There is a tweak/equalizer in the setup that allows you to pump the lows highs and middles around so it has a tiny bit more of a punch, but otherwise, consider an external audio unit. For the life of me, I dont know why these flat screen builders dont team up with BOSE to get more out of the audio from within the unit.This is a very good unit. I bought LG again after a lot of shopping.  This particular version has taken a while to learn. I'm still learning. I've only had it up and going for 3 days so much more to the tutorial and review is forthcoming..More later...stay tuned.*********************************************************************************Still overall pleased with the unit..BUT, the folks in LG product development have to do SOMETHING about the remote. Sorry boys but it just plain sucks. Function buttons are crammed together and don't have a very good touchyfeely to them so you can do blind navigation. It's just too small..so small that your fingers/thumbs accidently hit wrong functions and send you off to neverland. If you have big mitts or fat thumbs you wont like it.  I don't, but I can tell you that after having this set for awhile now, that's the only real flaw that I can find.By the way I dont know whoever decided that remotes should always be black but what say we try some variations to the color..? Give the old folks a break. WE dont all work in an office or test lab where everything is in its place. One other bit: Many of the on-screen function changes are redundant and not necessary. Someone went app and gadget crazy. Even while the designers are trying to cram all the technologies from phone, to internet to wireless this and that all into one fun package..you can still keep it simple to learn AND operate.", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Gorgeous television", "Author": "E", "ReviewID": "R2QRKNELDWRXHN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The picture quality is superb, especially since I am using it as a second monitor, the picture looks like it is live, it is so crystal clear.

So here's my story and hopefully you'll get more of a review from it than from an actual review.I play a lot of videogames...  A LOT! and there was a problem with my current tv : it ran at 60 hz which gave this ugly motion blur which became quite the issue since most of my games are action oriented and theres a lot of movement and things happening all the time.. SO I heard that TVS which ran at 120 hz solved this issue by removing the motion blur... I proved this to be true when I played xbox at a friend's house with a tv which ran at this speed. So I thought... \"well, it's been 7 years with my old tv, maybe it's time to upgrade\". Now I've always loved LG, their products were always top notch and up until now they have never let me down so the choice of brand was easy for me.. and so I bought this TV specifically because of the trumotion... theres a HUGE PICTURE in the box advertising this TRUMOTION THING, and also a HUGE STICKER right there on the TV when you take it out of the box with \"120hz TRUMOTION\" on it.I turned on the TV and to my surprise it looked exactly the same as my 7 year old SAMSUNG tv... what a rip off!I thought that maybe I had to control this option somewhere and so I browsed to every single option of the entire menu but to no avail. Then, searching online for a solution or something about it I found out that there were a lot of people with the same issue, every single one of them had searched on their own for an answer via the online chat, mail or other forums.more info. here: [...]The consensus was that it was a firmware issue and that an update would fix it... Now I just bought this tv one week ago but some of them had bought it more than a month ago and all of them (and me) had been waiting all this time for the update with LG giving us the run a round: \"the update will be available in late may\" \"sometime in june\" \"at the end of june\" and so I had it... I've contacted them through twitter, facebook, online chat and email... but no acceptable answer (of course)The TV does everything else it says it does, but it would be dumb to pay full price for this when there are  tvs that do the same but don't have trumotion and thus cost less money.If you plan on buying this tv I strongly recommend to make super sure that it does everything it says it does.", "Date": "June 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great picture quality, good sound and lots of online apps but not good enough for gaming", "Author": "SteelCity1981", "ReviewID": "R2Z7RNXPE9HRX0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The picture and sound quality are great and it has a long list of good online apps, but that's as far as the good parts about this tv goes for me.The remote wand isn't as all it's cracked up to be. There is no actual buttons on it not even a quick input button to switch back and forth input devices. You have to click on home, then input list and then choose your device input. That's just too many steps to choose from inputs. Next I found the arrow to disappear too quickly when you are looking at something just for a couple seconds. you have to click the center button again for the arrow to reappear.There is honestly nothing i can say good about TrueMotion. Some people may like it, but i don't, it makes everything look like a soap opera effect so i had to turn TrueMotion off regardless if it was set on smooth or clear. Antoher thing i don't like about  TrueMotion is when it's enabled in 3D mode it makes 3D look worse. So i had to turn it off just to watch something in 3D properly.But the thing that really bugs me the most is playing games on this TV there is no game mode FPS games feel sluggish esp when you are aiming i have tried every option you could think of and it doesn't make a diff, quick movements are still sluggish. I have called tech support about this issue and they couldn't help.Plus the 120hz isn't true 120hz either it's TrueMotion 120hz ie \"in house rating\" not an official standard rating so you are actually getting 60hz  real refresh and not 120hz. Some people dispute this by saying it depends on the device, but if that was the case then my Sony HDTV which actually scales to 120hz rate on my xbox 360 would  instead read 60hz like this TV does on my xbox 360, but it doesn't because my Sony is an actual 120hz HDTV and reads 120Hz on the display when i'm on my xbox 360.I Am alittle dissapointed with this TV. I could live with the wand, I could even live with the jumpy sound, but since i play a lot of games on my TV the sluggish feel is something i just couldn't live with.You don't have to take my word for it as you can see there are plenty of reviews on this site about this HDTV to make your deciding factor about buying this HDTV.

Peterson", "ReviewID": "R3UBHNQKZ0E38P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchase the LG 55lm7600 about 6 months ago and think the picture and 3D are great. So I purchased up to the 65. Major dissapointment, the 65 dosn't have local dimming, the 3D still works great, but the picture stinks. I prefer 3D passive to active. The picture/screen looks hazy, greyish and seriously lacks shadow detail. Every time I switch sources I spend 5 mins readjusting the pic to be barely watchable. I watch mostly movies, in the dark, and this tv is terrible for that. The dimming has to be raised to provide white contrast for any sort of black, to the point where the pic is much to bright for a dark room. The 55 kinda has the same problem but I was able to adjust it out with local dimming, brightness and contrast, of course. The other major problem I see is that sitting any where but directly in center of the screen produces a foggy appearance on the opposite side of the screen. Moving side to side just 1 foot makes a big difference in the blacks. This effect bleaches out colors and turns blacks greyish.I just can`t get no satisfaction.I`m giving the set a week??? If it weren`t for the size, 3D, and day time viewing I`d give this tv 1 star.2/5/13 Addendum, Update; I might have been a tad to harsh earlier. Don't expect to find out who's lurking in the shadows until they or it comes out in the light, because this tv has no detail in shadows. This tv does many things really good, size, brightness, contrast, colors, sharpness, Internet, 3D. I'm happy with my solution to the lack of local dimming, which is to use the \"power saving\" levels to determine over all picture detail and brightness. Minimum or off for day viewing, medium for dusk, dawn or cloudy, and maximum for lights out movie viewing. I see no difference in motion judder or blurring between the 55 240hz and the 65 120 hz.Off center viewing still is an issue. Shadow detail is an issue. Visible scan lines in 3D mode is an issue.

The 3D effect works well too, but no one in my family seems to like 3D.  For me [I'm 67], I can watch it only for about 30 minutes - then I get dizzy.  My wife watched it once for about 10 minutes and ran off saying: \"I'm going to die\" [I'm serious].  I thought that my four year old granddaughter would like it, but she asks for regular TV after about five minutes.  So, we never use the 3D function, even though there are about six movies on Starz that are available on 3D.Plus, when you read the instruction manual that came with the TV, it even says that you should only watch 3D for 1 1/2 hours!  And that older people can get dizzy!So, in conclusion, 3D isn't worth the extra $400 or so to get the 3D effect.  And, I have an older Samsung plasma TV [a 42\" about 7 years old that cost $2,600 believe it or not], that really has a better picture than this LED-LCD.

Great picture, the remote is easy to use. As regards the Smart part- the internet part is redundant unless you don't have a computer- clunky to navigate. You Tube and Netflix easy to set up and use (line up any videos you want to watch up on YouTube on your computer first as searching on the TV is laborious).Now the BAD part if you have an Apple computer. The TV comes with a disc to download a program to enable you to link the TV with your computer for photos, music etc. It includes Mac on the disc cover but after many attempts could not install. Checked the TV user guide and there it states \"LG TV's not compatible with Apple computers\". Quite unbelievable in this age of Apple. Contacted LG support and they recommended some DNLA applications to download to enable connection. Some are free but many you have to pay for. I tried a couple  of the free ones( not easy to find or install)but they are dreadful. Slow to load and a nightmare to navigate. I finally solved the problem with an Apple TV for $99. Works great but renders the Smart part redundant as I could have got Netflix, Youtube and my link to my computer, i pad, phone etc with Apple TV in the first place.So if you need a new TV and desperate for 3D (even though hardly anything is available to watch in 3D!) go for it. But if you just want the other \"smart features\" save yourself some money and get an Apple TV box or similar device.

Video quality is stunning, including 3D. TV is very light; has plenty of connectors (HDMI, component, composite, VGA with audio, 3 USB - I am still trying to figure out how to use it). Plenty of applications. Magic remote takes some time to get used to, but now I love it. 3D glasses are light and comfortable, even for people that are wearing glasses.Two extra features that I didn't see in similarly priced other TVs.First, real Internet browser. For vast majority of web-surfing tasks you don't really need a computer (I have an old laptop attached to it, but I notice that it's often faster to browse through TV itself). Unfortunately, the browser doesn't support Silverlight, so if your site displays video in Silverlight - you are out of luck. Also, it doesn't allow \"full screen\" mode; so you will watch your favorite videos only in a window inside the browser.Second, non-English keyboard support. As I am using Cyrillic keyboard almost as often as English, this turned out to be a pleasant surprise.Now, disappointments (obviously, these may not be applicable to your situation):WiFi for some reason is very slow. Speed test shows 1.4Mbps, while a laptop in the same place shows 8Mbps (same as wired). Consequently, HD and 3D movies play excruciatingly slow. Don't know if it's adapter, or compatibility with my router - but I ended up putting an old Netgear 85Mbps Powerline Network Adapter Kit - XETB1001 and the speed went way up.Network setup (both WiFi and wired) allows only DHCP connectivity. For devices that are always connected I prefer static IP, but it is not possible with this TV.YouTube app *doesn't* use the same keyboard that all other places. Unfortunately, its own keyboard does not support non-English characters, and the application is almost useless for me. Fortunately, I can watch YouTube through the browser; so it's not such a big deal. Interestingly, Facebook also uses its own keyboard, but it *does* allow non-English characters (some 50 languages).The processor is quite slow; so loading takes a long time; remote occasionally hangs for up to a minute. Of course, it's more obvious when you are \"playing around\"; once you actually watch a show, everything is fine.Last, the stand feels very flimsy.

Taylor", "ReviewID": "RYP08W8HQDERX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay, so I've had this literally sitting in the box in my living room for two months (!!!).  I needed my husband's help to assemble it and he is now finished with school.  So yesterday we assembled it (pretty easy) and hooked it up; we've been playing with it ever since.  Here are our observations:the GOOD--1) The picture quality is amazing!  Many movies look more like you're watching a live play (think Playhouse Theatre production) instead of a movie; the people are dimensional, their shadows are so lifelike--it's like nothing else I've ever seen.  We've tried the 2D-to-3D, and neither of us is wowed by it; maybe for an action movie it will be cool, but the regular picture in 1080p is awesome--SO much better than our former 720p Samsung.2) The viewing size (47\") is perfect for our living room; my husband can watch sports from our dining room with ease.  :-)3) The sound is very clear and crisp.  We don't have any external speakers hooked up to it and are happy with the different available settings for the sound.4) The fact that we were able to connect wirelessly to our home network is pretty darn cool, even if we don't use it much.  I've seen that LG now makes a Google TV with a keyboard; don't know if the keyboard would work with this set but I'd be very tempted to get one if it did.the BAD--I fear my husband will watch even more television now that we have this set since the quality is so fantastic!the FRUSTRATING--1) the lack of good instructions/manuals with the set, especially for all the settings, is disappointing.  With our previous Samsung we had a booklet that explained all the settings and options.  With this set we've had to simply explore everything which is pretty time consuming.  We discovered that by leaving ON the Energy Saving option, the picture got darker after awhile--so we turned that off.2) When we set it up yesterday, it appeared we would have to use 2 remotes:  the Magic Remote to change channels, and our Verizon Fios remote for volume and other functions.  Then I remembered that we had to \"tune\" our Fios remote to recognize the LG TV (ours used code 3145) and now we can use the Fios remote for everything related to television viewing. We still aren't sure if we've got our DVD player connected right; will test that this week.3)  we tried Auto Tuning the set but it didn't recognize any channels so that's why we are simply using our Fios remote.  We'll call LG customer service to get that straightened out.  Because of that when you move the Magic Remote to the top of the screen, there is no info on what channel you're watching (although clicking on \"Info\" on the Fios remote tells you).4) After reading a review here, I noticed that everything we've watched is coming in at 60Hz, NOT 120Hz.  We'll also ask the LG customer service about that, and when the upgrade will be available.  It DOES seems a little like false advertising if it's not using 120Hz right now.  Even at 60 Hz, the fast action shows we've watch have been smooth, with no pixel degradation.  I've read it isn't as big an issue with LED (like this one) and plasma TVs as it is for LCD TVs.5) Another thing about the Magic Remote having no manual, we haven't figured out (if we decide to use it) how to switch from one channel to another specific channel since there isn't a numbered keypad on the remote.  KWIM???I see that this set also comes in \"aluminum\" which I think is preferable; this black is a dust & fingerprint magnet.  In fact, we are going to put our old swivel base under the TV so it will turn  much easier with fewer reasons to grab the TV itself.All in all, this is a wonderful TV with fantastic picture and sound quality.", "Date": "July 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cannot watch ESPN3 on this model, disappointed", "Author": "Irene Innes", "ReviewID": "R2GXZ8X0TX3MI2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Just got the TV and the picture quality and features are very good for the price.

The TV itself says that it is 60Hz when you click on program information.I turned the smoothing option on to the highest setting: \"User, 10\" and it doesn't look much different. Smooth, Clear and User 10 all look similar.If you try the Panasonic ET5, you can really see a different between the 3 levels. I have an easier time believing the Panasonic is 120Hz wherein it has ZERO blur and the motion picture setting (smoothing) really works.Can't believe LG put this product out and advertised the features specifically. Some other reviews mention that it was fixed in a software update, but it wasn't. I think they addressed the issue, but didn't fix it.Can we expect another update? I don't know considering they are probably working on next years models and support will probably eb discontinued for this one soon.A Small issue is the stand LG designed. It looks nice and fashionable, but there is a lot of wobble in it. This could have been a design trait to absorb shock, but it just doesn't feel sturdy to me.", "Date": "August 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Evidence of motion blur", "Author": "Hoya", "ReviewID":

The one type like Sony, Pioneer and Intel test their products rigorously to ensure extreme reliability over an industry standard of 7 years.
