{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great picture quality, except for off-angle viewing", "Author": "peterfram", "ReviewID": "R3T3RURYKN8O1L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Note, this TV uses \"direct lit\" technology from Samsung. To reduce cost the EH6070/6000 models use fewer LEDs than traditional full array backlit or edge lit displays of the higher end slim models. And it is 120Hz, not 240Hz. 240Hz CMR is just a Samsung marketing label. That does not really matter though since 120Hz is pretty good.To my surprise and inconvenience it took me a few days to calibrate this screen. The options are limited but not too bad and certainly easy to work with. But I initially had a consistent problem fixing blown out yellows/limes/cheddar cheese colors. At first I was alarmed thinking that perhaps the new and cheaper direct lit technology sacrificed digital dynamic range. And I also had to deal with a seemingly old school 1990's overly red flesh tones problem. I tried multiple EH6000 calibration settings posted on avsforum and multiple review sites but was not satisfied. I was considering returning it.So I pulled out my Disney WOW calibration Blu Ray. It seemed like I hardly changed a thing, but somehow that calibration did the trick. Everything looks pretty close to perfect now. In the past I never spent more than 10 to 15 minutes calibrating a new TV or projector.Initial impressions are that our older Vizio SV472XVT has higher end components with full backlit array versus Samsung's new direct lit. However, despite something slightly inferior with the Samsung in overall screen micro-light management appearance, the Samsung beats the Vizio in depth of color rendition. The Vizio might win for watching standard TV dramas and news. But the Samsung wins clearly when watching high depth modern animation like Toy Story movies etc and video games.The direct lit technology uses fewer LEDs to reduce cost by quite a bit. There is a small price to quality which I can see but is hard to describe. Less micro management of light I guess. More like the first LCD's. When you bring up the all white screen on the Disney WOW calibration tools you can clearly see each section of LED lighting with grey gaps between each section and slight grey blotches in the upper left and right corners about 4 inches from the edges on the 55 inch model. I did not try this on the Visio, so nothing to compare this to. Whatever I see in difference is small enough that I don't really care however because the overall image produced on the screen during normal viewing is quite beautiful. I probably would never have noticed all this had the EH6070 been better calibrated out of the box.**May 2014 Update**Still going strong. Zero issues and pic quality appears better to me than most of the new edge lit slim models I see in Costco these days.**Original Review**That is my only beef with this TV. It took me 15 or 20 minutes here and there over a few days tweaking settings to get it to look right. Kind of an inconvenience.So in the interest of helping others, here are my hard earned current beloved EH6070 calibration settings.Backlight 19Contrast 100Brightness 44Sharpness 12Color 47Tint G51/R49AdvancedDynamic Contrast OffBlack Tone OffFlesh Tone -1RGB Only Mode OffColor Space AutoWhite Balance G-Gain 26, all others 25Gamma 0Motion Lighting OffPicture OptionsColor Tone StandardDigital Noise Filter OffMPEG Noise Filter OffLED Motion Plus OffBy the way, the reason I bought this model (and you might) over ES6500, ES7100 or other?:-No need for an edge lit slim TV since this is a corner installation in my family room. Also I can see the edge lit uniformity issues on the Costco showroom floor if I stand and stare long enough. The bleeding and torchlight problems with those higher end edge lit screens would not bug me very much, but I really do not feel the need to pay extra for it.-The EH6000/6070 TV has a mostly (but not a pure) matte screen. Plasmas and edge lit screens are almost entirely glossy to improve black levels. Glossy creates strong reflections. I can't watch anything when there is a light reflection on the screen. I just stare at the light and lose focus of what I am watching. We have kitchen lights in the distance behind one sofa and my wife likes to keep a light on around the sofa. The matte screen on this TV works very well at avoiding reflections. The black levels on the EH6070 are great. Black is seriously black. So don't worry about that.-3D for the kids! I had never before seen 3D on a TV. And while not a fan of 3D except for kids movies, I was impressed with Hugo and the Lorax. It's no more slightly distorted/weird than viewing in a movie theater. It is actually quite high quality and pretty cool in your home. Modern 3D is still for kids, or kids at heart. While I have nothing to compare to but movie theater 3D, this TV seems to do a good job with 3D. I also watched a quarter of NFL football in 2D to 3D conversion mode and it was kind of cool. You see the depth somewhat as if you were at the stadium so you can better tell the height and direction of movement of the players and the ball. But the you still have the slight weirdness of 3d and realistically you would want to watch your sports in 2D. For serious viewing I still classify 3D in the gimmick category. I would much rather watch a good non-kid's movie in 2D. The 3D glasses must go though. Glasses are annoying and inconvenient for making sandwiches in the kitchen and watching a movie at the same time!TV speakers & sound are fine. usually used by the kid. I use an attached AVR with surround speakers for most of my serious viewing though.", "Date": "September 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV bundle with blue-ray", "Author": "Sheng", "ReviewID": "R32VLZW4ZUZ3KI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "= Summary =Pros:- Good starter bundle, has everything you need for a 3D smart TV, especially it gives you the blu-ray player- Great price for a Samsung TV- Amazing 3D effect- It makes XBOX games look fantastic- 3D glasses fit onto my glasses, so no worries if you wear glassesCons:- Web apps are slow- The remote controls for the TV and the player look very similar to each other- Only 2 pair of 3D glasses= Original post on July/2012 =This is a new model manufactured in May 2012, the price is decent, and this bundle has all the things you want:- Wifi support- Apps- Blu-ray- 3D- LEDThe only difference between this one and the more expensive ones is that the TV itself does not have wifi, but the blue-ray player does the magic of smart tv work. So if you are going to need the blue-ray anyway, this bundle is definitely a good deal.I have not got a chance to watch any 3D movie on it, but just playing XBOX games, it has been fantastic. The 55 screen looks awesome, so is the sound.= Sep/2012 update, after using for 2 months =I have been using the TV for about 2 months, majorly playing XBOX and watch Blu-ray movies, and it performs really well. I finally got a chance to watch the 3D movie Transformers, and it was amazing. One thing I like about the glass is that it fits onto my glasses too, so if you wear glasses, do not worry, the 3D glasses pair is very light and will fit. I hope it comes with more glasses though.The remote control's response is good, the only down side is that you will have two similar remote controls, one for the TV and the other one for the player. Sometimes I got confused with one from the other.I only used the apps inside the player once, and it was very slow.

I was looking for reviews but found sparing.. but they were good.. and since I found this a 2012 Model my eyebrows raised and felt its a good deal where you get all in one.. Though the TV itself does not have wifi, BD has it.. so good deal....On TV, it looked little bulky on the back, but the screen and the other looks cute.. Not like the one which are slim.. But when you are watching from the front you wont feel its minor bulge...or others..After I installed the TV and BD, I played a 3D movie and converted the 3D to 2D.. the Picture  Quality  of this TV is absolutely Stunning.. crystal clear both in 3D and 2D.. I was amazed and I was quite happy with the product.. Simple to install and go through.. I did not listen the sound on this TV as I purchased a Onkyo HT.On HDMI Inputs, am covered.. as my HT has 4 Inputs and 1 Out.. So I got 3 free slots.. I can plug any :-) .On the Blue Ray, It has got the apps that one needs.. HULU and NETFLIX covered my Cable cost.. and I watched the shows (HD) and movies they are cool.. and Brilliant. I was little disapponted on the BD as it did not had one of the APP which Samsung is shipping with all its models (It does not come with Yupp TV).. I wish Samsung gets the Crackle app and the listed app to this BD model too..The TV has sensitive eye.. it adjusts the brightness as per the room and lighting that you have.. when .. No need to calibrate.. (and I did not calibrate) any of the default setting .If people are looking for 3D+ BD+ 55inch. TV like me in low cost.. this is it... no more looking back.. If someone wants a slim version of the TV with all in one TV, then you need to give a think.So, Its definitely a worthy product to go..", "Date": "July 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Flimsy stand, but otherwise great!", "Author": "Foboz", "ReviewID": "RI7EVVNIXZAF3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, this is a \"240Hz\" HDTV like is says in the \"Samsung LED TV Comparison Chart\"; not \"120Hz\" like it says in the description.Second, compared to my old 51\" 1080i rear-projector the picture is simply amazing!  Can't wait to watch the Patriots games on this bad boy!The bundled Blu-ray gets the job done and makes up for the lack of smarts in the TV nicely (how many smart devices does one need anyways?).  It had no problems connecting to my home NAS via 802.11g and streamed music, ripped DVDs, and Netflix just fine (I don't have a Blu-ray in my computer so I can only rip standard DVDs).  However, when doing anything other than just playing discs, the Blu-ray player does tend to get a little hot.The menus on both the TV and Blue-ray are pretty straight forward (be sure to adjust the picture settings to your liking); I thought the TV produced pretty good sound for a TV.  I was skeptical of the 3D effects, but after watching \"Despicable Me\" in 3D with the wife and kids I must say I was impressed - it's as good as what you'll see in the theater.Couple of minor minuses that prevent it from getting five stars: one, the stand is very flimsy and two, even though the glasses are inexpensive I think it should have come with four pairs instead of two.", "Date": "August 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great purchase and great picture!", "Author": "Taterbug \"Tbug\"", "ReviewID": "R3QQLOI93QBYON", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not going into a technical review because there are many about this model that are well written. It's true it has a great picture and obviously the Blue Ray player with the Smart Apps make this a nice deal. The 3D part is cool but actually it's interesting for the first few days then I lost some interest. Still a nice feature.  The negatives are few but I will try and tell you what others missed.  The TV stand does NOT swivel.  It also does not have any audio outputs other than a digital audio out.  (I have a slight hearing problem and have a Sennheiser wireless headphone set that I used sometimes when watching so I could hear better. Also helped at night when you were in bed and didn't want to disturb the wife.)  Anyway, I can't connect it because of lack of the RCA audio outputs on this model. My older 32\" Samsung had that feature.  Not a big deal for most.  Also this has only 2 HDMI's which it does state but seriously they need to make 3 standard. On higher models usually you get that feature plus others so take that into consideration. You get what you pay for in any TV so all in all most people will love this combo and price.

It arrived on time in the factory box looking like new, with a slight ding in one side of the box and a DVD movie inside the DVD, but it was a good one! This TV/flat panel is like a window when mounted on the wall(which I did easily with a mount from Amazon). The clarity and sharpness is amazing. The sound is also quite good for a flat panel probably due to the deeper back which wasn't a problem on wall installation. The DVD integration for smart TV features is excellent and I had no problem linking it to my router in my Den(2 rooms away).

I got an amazing deal for a really good tv.I have a bright room and my older 42 toshiba was too reflective making tv watching difficult.This tv's matte screen is much better for the most part. Bright lights can give a slight rainbow affect but I'm pretty happy.Blacks do get crushed on this, being lcd, but as plasma is not available with a matte screen I'll settle (in fact few LCDs come this way either).I use this mainly for my XBMC htpc, it works nicely for that. My old tv would never turn itself off (if I accidently left it on, or even if the HTPC went into sleep) but this one does which is great. Hate coming home to a tv that's been sitting powered on all day.Sadly, no PAL support (25/50hz refresh rates) for you british tv watchers. I think only some Sony's are confirmed to support that currently on this side of atlantic.Motion seems really good, I don't see a lot of ghosting - 24hz movies look near flawless except for the dark scenes (but still on par with most other lcd on that front).Backlighting seems really even, much better than most more expensive edge lit LCDs. Yeah this tv is thicker but i'll take that for more uniform lighting to avoid that 'dirty screen' look.Haven't noticed any backlight bleeding or flashing.3D - hadn't planned to use this (I was originally lookign for a samsung eh6000 which doesn't come with the glasses or bluray player) but the price was really good on this set. The 3D is good! I haven't actually watched a 3d movie in many years but I'll admit this is a nice plus. It did take me 2 weeks to figure out the reason the glasses didn't work was because I had the batteries in backwards.. Maybe i'm dumb but the cr2016's fit both ways - thought it was xbmc's fault.Bluray player - Didn't have a need for this, but I actually use it quite a bit with my older toshiba.

My selection was between the lg 7600 and this tv, the 6070. The lg 7600 was on sale but I missed it, so I got the Samsung and the bluray player bundle. I have a samsung lnt4669 and that has the most incredible picture I have ever seen.  This tv was $1000 less and the picture is clear but not as good as my other tv, but still an upgrade over my Sony that died that was 10the years old.  The 3d so far is ok but there really isn't that many programs to watch. I have yet to watch 2d unconverted to three d.Set came with 3 internal smudges that Samsung customer service had someone come out to replace the panel. Samsung customer service is the best.  So with that being said the set is an upgrade so I am happy and the bluray player I needed anyway.

I then went to Best Buy and purchased a replacement unit the same day, which worked for 5 months until the unit started restarting itself continuously, with the HDMI having a hard time keeping a lock on the signal... at first.  Eventually, even with all HDMI devices disconnected from the unit, it now continuously restarts itself every few seconds after it's been running for about 30 minutes.  This seems like it's a problem related to bad connections which are becoming unreliable when the unit heats up.While the unit worked, I had the same issues with getting a good picture as the other reviewers here - I've never messed around with a display this much in my life.  I had to carefully use the settings provided by other reviewers to get something that was \"just OK\", which on previous Samsung TV's just worked out of the box. I was never in love with the display though, as my previous Samsung displays were much better.  You need to disable almost all of the automatic features in order to get the display to not act up, which has been observed by many other reviewers here.  It's just a finicky set of TV's.With regards the \"12 month Warranty\" they advertise: Best Buy is refusing to let me return the defective product (they only honor manufacturer's warrantes in the first 15 days) and Samsung insists I have to ship the unit to Melbourne, FL at my own expense since my unit is more than 30 days old ($112.50 each way shipping costs). If something goes wrong, as did with two units - you are on your own.This is my third Samsung LED/LCD TV that I've owned, so I have a lot of experience with Samsung products.  My observation is that unit 1 (an LCD model) was made of solid glass and had a fantastic picture out of the box.  Unit 2 also had good build quality (an LED), but it felt cheaper and more flimsy than unit 1.  Unit 3, the defective unit, feels like a very cheap piece of plastic, and the screen isn't even glass (since I received a shattered one the first time, I got to see what it's really made of).  You get what you pay for, and this is a cheap TV for the size.I would not recommend Samsung TV products in this price range until they improve their build quality and stand behind their warranty.I will not shop at Best Buy again - Amazon is a MUCH safer bet if you have problems.", "Date": "April 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Super TV on affordable Rates", "Author": "Jean Paul", "ReviewID": "R2MNTMMJ3M834P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like this - good value for money.Like YouTube, NetFlix, Vudu - best enough for home entertainment (you should have faster internet connection too)I prefer the applications to be faster in future.", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "CHANGE THE PRODUCT PHOTO!!!!", "Author": "Amazon customer", "ReviewID": "R1J6XPQ0ZFQC0R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The picture shows the TV has smart hub, it doesn't!

Picture was great, 3D performance was good.  BAD audio sync problem.  I have a receiver that I run all of my gear through and it connects to a single HDMI input on the TV.  When I hooked up the set, anything that was routed through the HDMI input had the audio problem.  My previous TV was also a Samsung and did not have the problem, so that pointed to the new set.Initially, the audio would drift in and out of sync with the video.  At best, the audio was perfectly in sync, at worst it would lead the video by as much as three words.  Started poking around the web and found that the audio problem was a known issue with the EH6XXX series of TVs.  Found one post that said Samsung had released new firmware that fixed the problem.  My set did not have the latest firmware, so I installed it.  It did not fix the problem, just changed it.Now instead of audio leading the video, it lagged the video.  As before, it would drift in and out of sync, sometimes lagging by about 1 1/2 words.  There is a setting in the \"hidden\" control pages for changing audio delay, but that was not of any help either.  The setting adds/subtracts a fixed amount of delay to the audio, but the problem is not a constant delay, it drifts.Wrote Samsung support an email.  Their reply was very polite, but essentially they told me that if I had the latest firmware loaded that I was out of luck - maybe if I took it in for service, the shop might be able to do something about it.  Totally unacceptable for a piece of gear that costs that much.  The TV was returned and Samsung loses my business.  I will give an LG TV a try.  Will post about the LG after I have lived with it for a while.Update - April 1So, took a long time to get back to this.  Tried an LG (do not remember which one) and personally thought that their 3D was not as good as Samsung, although the LG passive glasses were easier to wear.  The LG went back after a couple of days.  I ended up getting one of the Samsung EH6000 series.  No 3D, I guess I am just not that impressed with 3D in general.  No smart features, I already have a Roku streamer that I am happy with and did not see any reason to spend extra money on a smart TV with features that esentially duplicated the Roku.  Very happy with the picture quality and features of the EH6000 TV, it is a good TV.  As far as the audio sync problem, I finally gave up on that.  The Samsung EH6070 and the LG that I tried both had severe sync problems.  The EH6000 that I have now occasionally has problems as well, although it does not seem as bad.  It seems to pretty much take care of the problem if the TV is turned on last.  Maybe something to do with HDMI handshaking.  Even doing that, the sync problem happens once in a while.  Guess I will just live with it.  I am tired of swapping TV sets, when it seems that they probably all have the problem to some degree.", "Date": "February 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "un55eh6070samsung", "Author": "Hon M.
