I have not have any problems with the sound or picture. The built in speakers make enough sound for me.  My friends have recommended that I buy a sound bar but I haven't had the need for one.  I would definately recommend this TV to my friends and family.", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Panasonic 54\" Plasma TV model TC-54PS14", "Author": "F.

Sound quality seemed \"distorted & fuzzy\" at times even after multiple adjustments. Called for service and they said it was speaker vibration and install pads to lessen the vibration.Didn't really seemed to make a differencce. Hooked it up to my home theater and still sounded \"fuzzy\"And 'YES\" it does have a audio output...it's optical and your amp needs to have a optical input to work.So I'll call for service again as I believe it's the sound board in the tv because when I use the tv optical output the sound issues is unchanged.This can be verified by playing a dvd and using the dvd players output to input to the home theater..I'm sure the sound will be clear.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,999.95", "Features": "54\" Class Viera S14 Series Plasma\n1080p HDTV - 600Hz Sub-field Drive Creates crisp, focused images\nViera Image ViewerTM Makes photo sharing easy\nViera LinkTM Control compatible devices with a single remote", "Name": "Panasonic VIERA S14 Series TC-54PS14 54-Inch 1080p Plasma HDTV, Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41zFtYkk79L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002M0R7KC"}}
