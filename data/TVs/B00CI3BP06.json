{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fantastic TV for the price!", "Author": "Neaz Ahmed", "ReviewID": "R1G6LW1XR0EWAT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't write many reviews so this will be short and to the point with some helpful info.I just received this TV using Costco (comes out to be same price after tax/shipping as Amazon, but you get 2nd year warranty free from Costco). The TV is packaged well and installation of the base was really simple.From reading the reviews here, I narrowed it down to this TV compared to similarly priced Samsung or LG. I'd like to say that maybe I got lucky (knock on wood) but the edge-light bleed is not so bad. After reading some forums about edge-light problems some people have had, I was expecting a nightmare. I went from a 32\" Philips LCD TV to this and I have to admit the Black level of the Vizio isn't as dark (probably a byproduct of the edge-lighting). However, don't be scared of Vizio because some people have had excessive edge-lighting issues. If your unit has a lot of this issue, then exchange it within the return period.Second, we all know that every TV now require some color tweaks. So I looked around and found this, which has worked amazing for me!Source: [...]The Settings:Settings:Calibrated DarkBacklight:50Brightness:52Contrast:73Color:53Tint:0Sharpness:20Color Temp:Normal (lowered both Red gain/Offset) white areas looked very pink otherwise.R/G:525G/G:472B/G:443R/Off:505G/Off:512B/Off:514Adv.Setting:Auto brightness:Off/High (works in reverse on this set) Example:Instead of the High setting being \"Max\" it actually dims it the least and \"Low\" practically turns the backlight off.Black detail:Off ( very aggressive Dynamic Con) crushed blacks on every settingSmart Dimming:OnReduced Noise:OffReduce Block:OffFilm Mode:AutoUPDATE: Feb 13, 2014Glad everyone is finding the settings helpful. I have uploaded some pictures to help you see where these numbers are which go way above 500.I also wanted to say a CON for the TV so far. The remote that came with it is utter garbage. However, I was planning on using my Logitech Harmony from the start so it did not affect me as much. However, you will have to get a new remote because the stock one is horrible.Another things I have found which is probably a feature of a SmartTV. I have Plex on my iPad and I can stream YouTube, Netflix, HBOGo directly to the TV from the iPad. You don't have to use the SmartTV's interface because iPad's interface is much better for these services.", "Date": "June 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "VIZIO M651d-A2R 65-Inch 1080p 240Hz 3D Smart LED HDTV", "Author": "Go Huskers \"Husker Power\"", "ReviewID": "R2AJRA8OT3X24L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Went to Best Buy the other day to check out this new Vizio tv on display. The salesmen wouldn't stop talking about how amazing the picture was on the new Sony 4K tv they had on display. The guy then proceeded to show me the images on the Sony provided USB drive and how much better this Sony could show the images than the Samsung across from it which he said was in his opinion one of the next best tv's out there. The images showed the tv's ability to display different colors as well as the ability to distinguish between different grays ranging from white to black. Also it's ability to display different Reds on an image similar to a vision test for color blindness.On each of these images the samsung struggled and couldn't display differences for about 1/3 of the color and gray bars. The Sonly 4K could. Then on the color blindness image it couldn't display a discernible image at all. It wasn't even visible.I said \"ok, well I'm really interested in this new Vizio, can you show me how it performs on the same test?\" \"Sure, but it probably won't do to well\" the salesman said. They hadn't had a chance to really mess with it yet.He ran through all the same images and to his amazement, every single image looked almost identical to the Sony 4K's image. His reaction was total astonishment, it was hilarious!! He couldn't believe his eyes. I told him thanks, that test only proved you don't have to spend crazy money to get an amazing picture!!These new Vizio's are an amazing bang for the buck. In my opinion, anyone that spends their hard earned money on anything else just for a better known name is crazy.Hope this helps some of you that are still nervous about the Vizio name being an entry level type of tv as I was, they have really stepped up their game!!I have purchased this TV myself and I love it. The only think I don't like is the remote SUCKS big time. It is the most aggrivating remote I have ever used!!! How can you make such an awesome TV and include such a trashy remote? Oh well. Just have to program my universal one to cover all it's functions that I can.", "Date": "June 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "COMPUTER USERS - Read my review!", "Author": "Brandon Linker", "ReviewID": "R2D9YCIFEPPPR2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, I am primarily a computer user. I value frames per second (refresh rate) and motion fluidity over other features like apps.  My greatest discovery with this TV in regards to getting the smooth motion to work as close to perfect as possible when viewing videos on your computer can be found near the end of this review.  It's pretty much the last paragraph.Bought from Walmart for 799 before tax.  The box was in horrible condition.  I had it shipped site to store.  I was worried I got a refurbished model or something it was so bad, but everything was in good working order inside.  Hooked it up without any issue.CONTROLLER: is pretty horrible.  I had a previous Vizio model which had the same issues with the controller.  It's like you have to press hard on the keys and hold them for longer to get it to respond.  Not sure if it's a controller issue what, but it is annoying.SOUND: The sound I consider pretty good for a TV.  The problem is, that they have the annoying sound leveling feature which turns up volume in low parts of the movie and you hear a bunch of fuzz.  If you turn it off, it seems that you can barely hear the conversations over the background effects and music.  A solution to this would be send the audio out to an external system.  I don't have an external system, so I figured I'd use a pair of computer speakers.  Unfortunately, this is the first TV that doesn't have a 3.5mm mini-jack (headphone) for audio out.  Frankly I'm surprised they've held on this long, but now that it's gone, I miss it.  The only audio out are RCA and optical for this TVFIRMWARE: Mine came out of the box with firmware version 1.29xxxx.  This is the \"old\" firmware.  The new is 1.4xxx.  I followed the instructions of another review to get the firmware to update.  Mind you, after registering, hooking up to your home network, and hitting the service call option in the system settings, the firmware will update when you have your TV turned OFF.  I turned it off for about 15 minutes and came back, and it didn't update.  Turned it off, and went to the computer to open a Chat with Vizio support, and during that time, it had updated the firmware.  To be safe, I would say, let your TV remain off for a half an hour and you should see something if you're lucky like me.PICTURE QUALITY: is great, it comes out of the box with the screen temperature on the cool side.  I like mine a little more towards the warm side and changing it was a breeze.  Apps are fine. I really have nothing to compare it too though, as most vizios I assume are alike, and my only other experience with a smart TV was a vizio as well.  The \"standard\" preset for picture settings has the sharpness turned up to 70/100.  This is much higher than what you would see on most screens.  Normal for me was around 40/100.  Other than that, I feel that the picture quality is great.  Love the thin bezel.LET'S GET TO WHAT REALLY MATTERS!!!  Smooth motion, frames per second, 3D, and can you force 3D and smooth motion effects when viewing a signal sent from your pc through HDMI.  So let's start off with it's 240hz claim.  Using the online chat support through the vizio website, I talked to a rep about this who really didn't know her stuff.  What I wanted to know was what was the true refresh rate of the TV, and what was interpolated.  I don't completely understand how the TV's do what they do, but I know enough to be dangerous. The rep knew less than I did.  Through educating myself online and what little knowledge I learned from her, I can tell you that there are no \"TV\"s in the US that accept a signal input of greater than 60hz.  The only way a TV in the US can claim to output a frame rate higher than 60hz is to take the existing 60 frames, and create frames in between them that are an average of the two frames.  This is called interpolation.  This doubles the frames per second and makes motion look more fluid.  Long story short, the rep told me that they interpolate up to 120hz, and the 240hz is only used during 3D.  So I suppose the advantage for this model is that you can view the smooth motion effect during 3D where you couldn't before.  I don't know if this is fact, but it is what I assume at this point.  I was really hoping that the TV could accept 120hz signal from my computer but that is not the case, and it looks like won't be the case for another decade.I am very happy to report that AFTER the firmware update, I can turn the 3D on and off whenever and wherever I want.  With my last vizio 3D tv and before the firmware update of this one, I could only turn on 3D when the TV decided it was appropriate, which is crazy for many reason which you can read about in other reviews.  Also with this firmware update, the smooth motion options seem to work at all times with a signal from HDMI.  Before, it would only turn on smooth motion when I was viewing a video in full screen that had a resolution width of 1080 or 720.  I figured it had to do with fooling it into thinking it was receiving a signal from a blu-ray or something that was 720p or 1080p.  Regardless, I didn't like this, because my dream was to play a game with the graphics options set to 60hz and have the TV interpolate it up to 120hz.  I'm happy to say that with this TV this dream became a reality.  I have gotten it to work, although I haven't figured it out completely.  There are probably some settings I need to tweak because it took a little of finesse to get a few games to work with the \"smooth motion\" effect.OOOOOHHH! BEFORE I FORGET, LET ME GIVE YOU A PRO TIP THAT WILL SAVE YOU FROM PULLING YOUR HAIR OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**** I'll dare to be presumptuous by saying that I imaging most people probably wouldn't notice or not care if the picture wasn't 100% smooth or had a bit of judder every few seconds in between smooth parts.  I'm use to playing games on my computer monitor at a TRUE 120hz, so seeing the \"smooth motion\" effect on the TV skip frames and start to judder was driving me crazy.  This happens for a reason, and there is a solution.  Here it is.... If you want the smooth motion effects to work as close to perfect as possible when viewing a movie from your PC, YOU WILL NEED TO SET THE REFRESH RATE OF YOUR MONITOR/TV TO THE SAME FRAME RATE THAT THE VIDEO WAS ENCODED IN.  Let me break it down and tell you how!  If you right click on the icon of the video that you want to play, and select properties, you can navigate to a tab that tells you the refresh rate or frames per second that that video was encoded in.  Most of the time it will be between 23 and 29.  Let's say it was 29.  You now need to go into your video card settings, or the display option in the control panel and change the refresh rate of your monitor (in this case, the TV) to 29 as well if possible.  If I remember correctly, the options I have are 23, 24, 29, 59, and 60.  If you don't have those options, try playing around with the video card settings.  I know that when I used the \"clone\" setting so that the computer sends the same image to my computer monitor as the TV, it matters which screen is the \"primary\" for what refresh rates it will let you select.  Also, it will give you different refresh rate options based on what your resolution is set at.  I know that at 1280x720, I can only choose from 59hz and 60hz. When I go up to 1920x1080, I can choose more options, from 23hz up to 60hz.  Anyway, after matching the refresh rate and hitting apply, close everything out and go back to your video file and start it up.  You should see a noticeably smoother picture through the TV now.  Without making these changes, there is a conflict that interferes with your TV's \"smooth motion\" effect. Probably because the video you are trying to play is 29 frames per second, but you have your monitor is typically set for 60 frames per second, and a TV is trying to take all of that and interpolate up to 120.  Doing so causes some dropped frames and judder that may annoy folks like me.  Experiment, and let me know your own findings.  You will see that different video players make a difference in this effect as well.  I had better luck with VLC and Media Player Classic than I did Windows Media player when searching for the best quality with \"smooth motion.\"  That holy grail of a smooth 120hz picture is something I'll always be chasing I imagine.  At least until they make a better TV or a larger computer monitor.This was a long winded review I know, but I wanted to share my successes and failures with everyone because I know there are people out there that want to use this TV in the manner I do and would run into the same issues.  All in all, it is a great TV for computer gamer and cable watcher alike.", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice TV, Support stinks please read about my experience with it..", "Author": "Richard Clapp", "ReviewID": "R30ABX97I32O4H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The colors and such are nice and rich.  BUT, the remote was damaged, apparently at the factory with the faceplate being lose.  Push it back into place and it stays put for a few minutes then fails again.  The buttons on the remote.  About one push of a button in ten was being caught by the TV.  Finally gave up after trying to set it up for 2 hours.  Called support on a chat today.  Complete waste of time.  To give you an idea; here is a partial transcript from the chat:Kali: I apologize for any inconveniences. We can't verify what happened to the remote between the factory to your purchase. Right now the only thing we can verify is whether or not you do the troubleshooting steps we're asking you to do.me: The broken faceplate is enough by itself to send the replacement.Kali: We cannot replace the remote until you're able to do the proper troubleshooting. If we set it up before that it will be cancelled and you'll end up waiting longer for a remote.me: How do you troubleshoot a broken faceplate?  with superglue?It went downhill from there.  So while the TV is nice, everything breaks sooner or later, do you want to go through what I did for support and still not have the problem fixed?  I would strongly suggest thinking about this aspect before purchase.  Myself, I am returning it for a competing brand.  I refuse to go through that service nightmare again.followup:Thought you might like to know something I found out.  Vizio, has a small group in their Customer response group who monitors reviews and social media for bad reviews.  They then go and mark them as not helpful and such to minimize the impact of them.  Two other companies have been caught recently doing this stunt here on Amazon and a few other sites.  It used to be that this was one of the better companies, products and service.  Per a senior manager at Vizio, this TV and remote combo has known issues and a major firmware rewrite was done, and is now in Beta.  It is expected to be pushed out in a few months.  This model was pushed out the door before it was ready.  In my case, there was physical damage to the remote before it left the factory.  I sent in pictures, an \"Engineer\" (would love to see that degree..) stated it was customer damage.  The picture was of the remote sitting on a table with the parts that fell off of it, laying next to it.  The flange on the faceplate appears to not have been removed from the mold cleanly when cast.  So no flange, just a ridge on one side.  Does not stay on, and when it falls off, so do the two items below it, that it holds on.  It rook calling the corporate offices and blasting them to get it replaced.  Vizio, used to bend over backward to help their customers, not now.  I also had to include a photo of the info plate on my tv, because they had not properly scanned my TV into their system when it left the factory and my Serial number was not coming up in the support system.  I had to prove my tv even existed and they had to put my serial number in at the support level.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT TV! Watch it and be happy.

Try IMAX Deep Sea on Amazon and see the impressive video!But don't bother calling Vizio support. The first two were rude and obnoxious. I am sooo tempted to post to You*tube the call when I finally told \"Matt 567 in SD' I had enough and was going to begin recording the call. Boy did his tune change!Use dynamic sound- a must IMHO- and turn off auto dimming. tweak pic a bit. I added some red and increased the black level to Medium. Images jump off the screen when video is in good resolution and color.Vizio should license the IMAX I mentioned for advertising, there wouldn't be a unit left in stock!Remember to DOUBLE-CLICK 'V' to manage apps. Weather4u is much better than stock Yahoo weather app. The Amazon app is pretty weak. No playlist, can't search prime movies, etc. It's a start, but very '2003-like' in its functionality. Linking to android in You*tube is a bit hinky at times and very limited. Hopefully these will get better with time.WIFI remote? Nope. Your TV isn't ready to support this feature yet is what tech support says. So erratic infrared only for now. No wifi keyboard either, which makes the preceeding particularly annoying.Big potential, but ot yet prime time in addon features. Superb base design, which is really the only part that can't be upgraded via software. If you trust Vizio to update addon software, go for it, you won't be sorry. If they don't make the improvements, we'll be made fools.Don't forget Amazon Prime members save $10 on purchase.UPDATE: After 6 weeks of owning this TV and a number of calls to Vizio tech support, I have to deduct a star and amend my review to 'Good potential, not ready for prime time' Apparently the remote is still the Achilles heel of this unit. It is unreliable and unresponsive. Yes, I received a replacement remote, same problem, even after I replaced the too weak batteries that came with the new remote.According to managers at Vizio the wifi direct (WiDi) mode is still not ready on this TV- or it is being rolled out to select groups, or engineers are still working on it...depends on which story you believe.The remote ONLY works in IR mode and the TV's sensor is at the far bottom left and has terribly weak reception.The TV has a bad habit of crashing a couple of times a week when using Netflix. The screen blanks and is unresponsive, then the power light slowly fades on and off until it turns off, though I can't tell if it is because I hit the power button on the remote or it shuts off by itself? After about 30 secs it seems to reboot and we can turn it back on and go back to about where we were in a movie (kudos to Netflix for their resume feature!)I've tried the factory reset, calling tech support, etc. Goodness help you if you talk to the SD office. Can't seem to get a word in edgewise. Josie 869 is like listening to a bad recorded-response system. Doesn't listen to what the customer says, much preferring to say her prefab responses, regardless of the relevance or lack thereof. A 'Push 1 for useless info' recording would be about as helpful.Without ranting, I can honestly say Vizio's tech support in South Dakota is easily the most frustratingly irritating support group I have ever called.In short, the product has real potential, has some great features, but not all of them are ready for the consumer, engineering dept has not been successful in correcting the failing or absent advertised features, and tech support does not have any solutions and their frustration shows when dealing with customers.As long as you do NOT want WiFi Direct (WiDi), a wifi remote, or a reliable RF remote function, and you are okay with rebooting your TV every 2 or 3 days when it crashes, the quality of the display is excellent.It may be a GREAT TV in a few months, but for now those with little patience for malfunctions and calling frustrating Technical Support lines are better off waiting or selecting a different product.*Update 3 Months:*  Cut 2 more stars for lack of warranty supportAfter 3 months of owning this TV, I have come to loathe Vizio. More than a half dozen calls, including to a \"Customer Service Resolution Specialist\" who \"I promise I will personally call you back\" about this TV that crashes when watching shows and STILL does not have any wifi remote capabilities.Each time I call support (this time I tried customer service instead of useless tech support line) it is a knock-down, drag-out battle to get past the front-line operator who will say anything to get you off the phone with nothing more than false hope the tv will magically heal itself.Customer service goes to South Dakota just like the tech support line. I don't know what they are feeding the folks there, but they sure don't care about honoring warranties or dealing with customers. They must be running a competition to see who can get a customer off the phone the fastest- no resolutions or solutions even attempted at this point.They have repeatedly offered- yet refused when requested- to replace this defective unit. As a last resort, they are sending a tech with parts to look at this tv. I have a feeling the intermittent problem will not be found or fixed in a short visit and I'll be stuck again with this tv.I so want to throw this thing out the window! Sure it will mean losing the money paid, but life will be much more pleasant without the repeatedly frustrating calls to Vizio!I've downgraded this product to BUYER BEWARE status. Decent product specs on paper but still never delivered full feature set such as wifi remote, and an absolutely horrible company for quality control or warranty coverage.Read any of my other reviews and you'll see I've never had to give such a poor report on a product or company.

I called and called and they told me no problem about a replacement but we need one more thing! After 10 calls and going back to them with pictures of the unit they said they would review and call me the next morning. I called back that next afternoon and they said it was still under review? I called back 2 days later and a CS rep said looks like this claim was denied! I asked for a manager and he said that based on the pictures it had to have been something I did to the TV. I told him I have not and he said things like \"A child could have thrown the remote at it and broke it\" Are you kidding me? There is no damage on the set and I explained that I could not have broken the inside of the set without damage to the outside. He said no I damaged it and they could not have done anything wrong nor could it be a defect! After reading reviews I noticed they dont warranty many things at all.

Witkowski", "ReviewID": "R3RH81TBGU28YW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "So after having my 55\" M-series for about a week I wanted to give some initial findings and considerations for potential buyers in the same boat and of similar mindset. I extensively researched every brand and screen type out there over the internet for months before I made this purchase and I learned a very valuable lesson in it all..... reviews are only reviews, in-home trial and error is the truest of tests.That being said, I'll list my top 5 Pros and Cons, in MY PERSONAL order of importance found in the Vizio M-series:Pros:1) Overall Value2) Dark Room Picture Quality (2D & 3D)3) Aesthetic Design (Screen & Stand)4) Ease of Use/Menus/Setup5) Smart TV FeaturesCons:1) Highly Reflective Screen2) Screen Uniformity (Light bleeding/Blooming)3) Goofy / Unresponsive Remote4) Set Design / Input Placement5) Lack of External ControlsSo in the end, the CONS got the best of this TV for me, here's why...Sure, the M-series can display a sharp, bright, and awesome 3-D picture, but only if you can see it through all it's reflections. In my average living room, with only 2 windows with coverings and 2 table lamps, the glare kills dark scenes 9 out of 10 times, head on or on angle viewing. Unless you have a dark room, only watch at night, or have complete control over external and internal lighting placement in your room, BE WARNED. This was #1 for me, and coming from a 6-year old 40\" Sony LCD (Matte Screen) this was night and day in a bad way.Secondly, dimming the lights also proved to be show-and-tell for the Vizio's screen uniformity issues. And yes, I did calibrate the picture based on CNET, AVSforum and other setting, but you can't hide all flaws with just settings. In low light/dark scenes the flash lighting from the corners, and blooming from the sides is quite noticeable, along with strange variations in brightness that would follow images down the sides of the screen.Besides that the remote is only semi-responsive, although I do like the back-lighting and overall layout. As far as input design I found it strange that they are so close to the unit my Mediabridge HDMI cables barely fit, and even then took some extra force, time and effort to get the right angle. Just be warned if you have heavy-duty or thick shielding at the base of your cables, they might not fit and require a fairly sharp bend in the cable. Lastly, the lack of external controls, besides power on/off button could be an inconvenience if you misplace or damage the remote as we all do from time to time, you would be out of luck.Like I said, the true test is in your home, with your settings, and none of these finding listed above, (besides the remote issues), was I aware of before my purchase. So maybe I'll save a few from the hassle of a return with my honest real-world observations. It's an attractive, slim and AFFORDABLE set with all the right features to make it competitive (minus some failed execution) that deserves a second look, just be sure it's limitations (Listed Above) are not deal breakers for you as they were for me.Luckily, Amazon has a great cost-free 30-day return policy, don't take this for granted in case you find a TV slightly cheaper someplace else!Just a little tip... Sharp is the only manufacture who still uses matte screens made for brighter or what I call NORMAL viewing conditions. They are not all the hype like the Vizio's lately, but for this reviewer they are the answer and the replacement.

A few weeks after installing this in my living room I noticed a fixed defect in the upper right corner, only noticeable when there were flat light colored backgrounds such as the sky, or a computer screen.  So I called up VIZIO attempting to get warranty service.  They asked me to upload pictures of the defect which I did and they stated this is a \"normal\" light bleed and \"not a defect\". I explained how this is a distortion which is visible on all programming and substantially impacts the picture.Vizio's response, and I quote:  \"90% of the time you are not going to notice the dark spot on normal broadcast TV, Its primarily on a light colored static screens that it appears. we don't publish the information because the majority of people don't notice the artifact and it's not on every TV set. we notice it a little more on the edge lit LED TVs but it's by a tiny margin compared to the millions of TV sold ea year\".It seems to me that Vizio clearly believes that delivering a defective product is OK if you don't notice it 90% of the time...  They know this problem exist but they call it a \"normal variant\" and that's just too bad for you.  In researching this purchase I read other stories like mine demonstrating Vizio's lack of support.

I miss my plasma and it is my preferred choice, but I have a little one now and the idea of a 100lb TV with a glass front crashing down on her made the switch a necessity.  I will say however, that the M Series made the switch a lot easier ;-)The Physical TV:I went with the 55 inch from Best Buy that was on sale for the same here. Amazon said 3-5 weeks on ship time and I would have had to take time off work to be home when it arrived.  I did have to pay the sales tax though, but it worked out just fine for my situation. First, it fit in the exact same space as my 50\" Plasma because of the razor edge design, so that was a nice bonus. Second, it really is easy on the eyes and very, very thin.  I'm not the biggest fan of the silver, as all my devices are all black, but a week later and I don't even notice it and its black around the front edge, so it really isn't a big deal. The screen gloss is not as bad as my plasma, but perhaps more than what most LCD TV viewers are used to seeing.  I guess the reason for this type of screen has to do with the Passive 3D, but I don't find it problematic.  Again, I'm used to full glass with plasma and I only get a lot of sun in that part of the house early in the morning.  So far, even with the sun coming in, it hasn't been an issue, although the cartoons my daughter watches in the morning are the very bright, newer looking shows like Littlest Pet Shop.  Wow, I just mentioned Littlest Pet Shop in an electronics review.  Its possible having a child has, in fact, destroyed my ability to relate to adults ;-)Picture Quality:The picture quality is amazing, and that is saying a lot coming from plasma.  I'm still playing with a lot of the settings and fine tuning the colors, but so far I prefer the Calibrated settings with some tweaks.  I don't like the soap opera effect, so during normal TV viewing, I turn the smooth motion off.  However, I watch a lot of Cardinals baseball games and it looks great turned to high.  I also prefer it with 3D as it eliminates a lot of cross talk and makes the image look more like a full 1080p image.  More on 3D below.  Update:  I am no longer experimenting with smart dimming.  Its an unusable setting IMHO.  It creates too much blooming and flashlighting in the corners.  I some may not notice it, but its way too noticible to me to be used.  You can still get an outstanding picture with the feature off, so there is no reason to lower my 5 star score.  Also, you might like it, so the take away is that you have a lot of options to adjust the Picture Quality just as you see fit.  I will say, however, that I am not experiencing the screen bleeding at the edges that a lot of others are mentioning.  This is an edge lit display, so some should be expected as it's a drawback common with the technology, but for me, it isn't an issue and certainly not a distraction of any kind.  However, about a 1/4 in around the edge by the bezel, the pixels are slightly darker.  Its not always noticeable and its likely a result of the 3D coating on the screen.  All and all, the black levels are very impressive for a non-plasma tv, regardless of your settings.  I promise you won't be disappointed in the picture quality, regardless of you personal tastes.3D:I have to say that I'm a true fan of passive 3D and this TV's 3D capabilities are a reason to own this set (so I'm hoping 3D doesn't fizzle out and die - thanks ESPN 3D).  I have viewed content in the form of Blu-ray, side-by-side/top-bottom on demand from cable and gaming with the PS3.  I have not yet tried the Sensio 3D but I imagine it's very good if their claims of maintaining higher resolution quality are true.  I will likely download the 3DGO app and try it at some point.  So to address a few common concerns, my TV arrived with firmware version 1.02 and I needed to upgrade to 1.04 before I could manually tell the TV to switch my Uverse signal to 3D.  I followed the instructions for a service call addressed in another review and then waited.  One person said you had to register your TV for the update, but for me, I just had to be patient.  I am connected wirelessly and after about 3-4 days, it was updated.  I didn't have to even tell it to install, I just went into my system settings to get my serial number so I could register the set, and it was displaying 1.04 firmware.  I immediately tested it with an On Demand preview and it worked perfectly.  I was able to select 3D and then the type (top/bottom, side by side, Sensio).  As far as the Smooth Motion, I actually like it in the 3D mode.  With Jurassic Park, there are definitely some jerky moments unlike the other Blu-rays that we watched (The Hobbit and Avatar), but I still preferred that to the lower definition you get without it.  I would just say play around with it to see if you like it.  There are two ways to turn off the Smooth Motion in 3D.  Either turn it off before you enter into 3D mode, or select the computer setting and it will turn off.  If it's off and you enter the menu and cycle through other picture setting, it will come on and you can't get it off, so that's when the computer setting is useful. I have only played one game, Crisis 2, in 3D, but I didn't experience any lag issues. I am curious to see how third person games will look.  Unfortunately, I just traded in Assassin's Creed 3, which is 3D, so I don't yet have a game to test it.Other:The remote really is as bad as people say.  You need a clean line of sight and you need to point it toward the bottom left.  Then you just need to be patient.  I'm glad an update is coming to switch it to wi-fi, but I have a harmony remote, so it's not too bad.  I still have some issues, so it's likely the TV's IR that is bad more so than the remote, but who knows.  I have looked at a few apps but I haven't given them much time.  They seemed a little slow to me, but it's my first go with a Smart TV, so maybe they are par for the course.Overall, I will say that I'm very impressed with the TV and it's an acceptable substitute for plasma given my situation.  The price point and passive 3D are what really sold me.  I have always been a Samsung TV owner, but I'm glad I made the switch.  Vizio is proving that you can still get an impressive TV with the features you want at an affordable price.  I would definitely recommend this TV.Update:  The firmware update changed some of the 3D menu flexibility.  Looks like game mode is the only way to remove the smooth motion, however, in 3D, I really like the smooth motion, so its not a big deal to me.  Also, once you launch 3D, it automatically switches to Vivid Mode, so you will have to change off if you want one of your preferred settings.UPDATE:  My settingsI am running the image through a Yamaha receiver, so it's possible the image is slightly different if a source is direct to the TV - perhaps not as its just passing through, but others have said the Yamaha improved color and PQ, so I thought I would mention it.  Also, I have switched to Cnet's calibration settings that they did when they reviewed the tv.  However, I have come to dislike the Smart Dimming feature so I have tweeked them to not use SD, which was a feature used in Cnet's calibrations.Settings: CalibratedBacklight:62Brightness:45Contrast:90Color:49Tint:0Sharpness:0Color Temp: NormalR/G:489G/G:462B/G:381R/Off:517G/Off:510B/Off:515Adv.Setting:Auto brightness: OffBlack detail: OffSmooth Motion: On with most 3D and sports, Off with normal tv and moviesSmart Dimming:  Off - Its very aggressive and when you go from a light scene to a dark one, the four courners take a few seconds to light up and its very distracting (flashlighting?)  Also, when in letterbox, the four corners are rounded and its highly distracting. Because of this, I just cant use SD.Reduced Noise: OffReduce Block: OffFilm Mode: AutoI have found these settings to be the best balance between a super dialed in picture with amazing color and acceptable black levels.  Using smart dimming does make the black levels better, but there are too may problems with it as of this update.  Should firmware updates fix the flashlighting and uniformity issues, I might very well go back to using it.  If you like SD or dont notice its problems, then look up the Cnet settings and enjoy the outstanding PQ :-)", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Problematic and difficult to use", "Author": "William", "ReviewID": "RIQXAJS1HKGU1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this for my father and there have been no end of the headaches.

Its mindboggling that they would release a TV with such poor infrared reception when the remote has onboard wifi. Vizio should have had that ready before releasing the TV and should also allow for manually firmware updates and not a slow phased remote update.Pros:-Slim and light.-Netflix and Amazon instant video app quality is great.-Able to pass-through Dolbey and DTS 5.1 signals from incoming HDMI through the 5.1 optical output (digital audio output has to be set to non-default bitstream and speakers off).-The remote control also controls the Vizio 4251w-b4 soundbar.-Good value (product for price)-8 pairs of glasses-Input lag is extremely low in game mode (but bad if not in game mode).-The picture quality is top notch in a dark room.

You'll be straining your arm and twisting it in odd directions to get your button presses to be received.  The problem is the TV, not the remote.  The remote sends signals to the sound bar perfectly with no problems.  It may have better reception if the TV is mounted at chest height though, as mine is on a stand 30\" up.-There is minimal white bleeding.  It is only present in the bottom-right on my set, a splotch expanding 8 inches from the corner.  It is about the same as I see on my $1,000 IPS computer monitor.  It is completely normal, unfortunately.  I only notice it in solid dark backgrounds.-The glare. Very bad glare. I have my sharp aquos(also a gloss screen) turned on next to this Vizio, and the glare difference is much worse.  Do not purchase this TV for frequent use in a bright room.-Input lag is really bad when not using game mode (but is extremely good in game mode). I mark this as a con too because it causes my computer cursor to lag (which is annoying), and I don't want to use game mode when viewing videos with a connected PC.This TV really needs to have an optional USB connected accessory that increases the infrared reception.", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Vizio M551D-A2R is absolutely the Best Bang for the Buck!!!", "Author": "Shelby625hp", "ReviewID": "R1B0V0AC3TELCL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Unpacked mine with delivery guy about 7 hours ago.

PC gaming on this set in particular has been a treat.The built-in \"Smart TV\" functionality wasn't a selling point for me, but I must admit that being able to start up Netflix with the TV remote while laying in bed is fairly neat. Naturally, this could be done from anywhere in the house thanks to the built-in Wi-Fi, and all of the software preinstalled on this TV is accessible, straightforward and easy to use - starting up with just the push of a button.Finally, I'd like to stress what a good investment this has been for me: it's one of those products that looks and feels lot more expensive than it really is, and the same could not be said for any of the other TVs I saw on display at Best Buy (where I made my purchase).

We have had it a couple of days now, and I can find very little to complain about.  The set came 3 days earlier than what was estimated and the delivery men set it up making sure the set was working properly before they left. The TV set up was easy without a hitch.This purchase came with a price guarantee for 14 days.  There was a price drop and Amazon came through on that too, reimbursing me the difference.  What a company!The picture quality is unbelievable. The blacks are really BLACK with even more than enough brightness, contrast and color saturation than necessary.  Someone said, it was like the characters on the program were in the room.  In 3D, I have to agree.The screen is very glossy though.  Many people complained about this on last year's model, but I love it.  There is a discernible picture quality increase with a glossy screen, in my opinion.  I even chose this kind of screen for my computer monitor and have never regretted it, but if you watch TV during the day and have light coming from in back of you, there will definitely be reflections.  I think the discernible increase in picture quality outweighs the reflection problem. There is some light bleed around the bottom edges of the screen on a total black picture.  It is not noticeable on normal viewing, however.The remote is nice but only works for the TV.  It is sometimes a little slow and sporadic reacting but tolerable.  If you have satellite, a DVD player or some other device you will have to be swapping remotes or opting for a universal remote.  Too bad this is not something supplied considering the cost of the TV and how inexpensive the programmable remotes are these days.The internet works great and was easy to set up.  Netflix has some 3D content now and gives even more entertainment.  The 3D is something you will just have to see to appreciate!  It is the best we have seen yet.  Even my 21 year old grandson, who hates 3D in the movie theater (said it makes him sick), marveled over the quality of the 3D picture.  It is displayed in 720 though, not 1080 for reasons, I am not sure why.  Maybe all of the sets do the same.  I could not tell the difference from 1080 though.  They are both stunningly clear.This TV replaced our old plasma TV we have had for several years.  On the old set, you could feel the heat anywhere around it.  This one runs perfectly cool burning very little electricity as well as not heating up the room.The viewing angle is reported as 179 degrees.  It does fade from extreme angles however, much to my surprise, I still got great 3D even from 50 degrees to the right and left of the center, a total of 100 degrees.  The direct center is the sweet spot with a slightly better picture though.The sound quality is fine.  No deep base but fine for voice, much clearer than my old TV. I am not real fond of the \"surround sound\" feature as it sounds kind of hollow.The glasses are fine, all 8 of them.  I think they are a little better quality than the movie theater variety and seem to be a little lighter in weight which is nice on the nose. By the way, the movie glasses work just fine with this television and are often given away at the theaters.We could not be happier with this Television.  It is great entertainment that, compared to most other sources of entertainment, it is a real bargain.  I highly recommend this television.7/17/2013Had this TV for over a month now and still as happy as when we first bought it.  To get rid of most of the light bleeding, we solved this by turning down the back lighting. This actually improved the picture.  It is now set to 53.  The remote problem was solved by taping a 2\" by 1\" piece of aluminum foil to the back of the TV, angled to the front , to reflect the IR signal to the sensor, which is below the \"on\" light on the left side of the TV. The remote works fine now.For the 65\" model, we found these settings to be best for us.  (I tried them all and this one is right on, in my opinion):(Calibrated  Dark)  Back Light 53  Brightness  51  Contrast  77  Color 50  Tint 0  Sharpness  60  Color Temp  Cool  Smart dimming On  The other color settings were left as is.The only deficit is voice sync with Netflix.  I think it is a problem with their services and is only noticeable on their 3D movies.  We love this TV!", "Date": "June 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Vizio M-701d and M-551d TWO THUMBS UP!!!", "Author": "Mascus", "ReviewID": "R3ST73Z18PD0VF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased the 55\" version of this TV a few weeks ago for my son and received the 70\" version a few days ago for my man-cave.  Being a Samsung fan, I was very skeptical about jumping into the Vizio brand of TV's.  I just couldn't justify the heavy price increase per inch between the Samsung over these new M-series TVs so I decided to take the plunge.  I replaced an aging Samsung 50\" plasma I purchased in 2005 with the 70\" M-series and the difference is unbelievable.  I am completely impressed with how far Vizio has come with its TV line.I got very lucky on both sets as both panels (55\" and 70\") are good to go without serious blemishes or imperfections.  The 70\" as indicated by others here on Amazon and other forums, exhibits the least amount of panel flaws.  I have very minimal (and I mean minimal) light bleed and only on very bright images.  It is hardly noticeable on either TV and you have to force yourself to even look for it.  Trust me, I'm pretty OCD about these kind of things and it doesn't bother me in the slightest.  If I bothered to lower the backlight a little it would completely go away entirely, but I like a bright screen and since it's almost invisible to detect anyway, I just left the backlight on high.It's not a major problem, but worth noting, as other reviewers have mentioned, you need to point the Vizio remote at the bottom left corner of your TV for it to pick up.  The remote on the 70\" is more responsive than the 55\" but not by much.  I did find a good work-around for this however.  I have Verizon FIOS and simply programed the Verizon remote to handle most of the basic Vizio commands.  For those with these new M-series TVs and FIOS, simply press the \"ok\" and 0 buttons at the same time on the Verizon remote and then enter code 424.  Next press the channel changing button until the Vizio turns off, hit ok and you're now able to control power on/off, volume, and input selection via the Verizon remote (which is about 90% of what you will use your Vizio remote for anyway).3D looks spectacular and the passive technology allows you to use any non-powered 3D glasses (hint:  next time you go to the movie theater, keep the glasses and don't recycle them...they will work on your new Vizio).The 70\" updated yesterday to firmware version 1.08, which I believe is the latest version right now.  As far as network connection goes, I have max bars indicated on my 70\" and 55\" and my FIOS router is on the other side of the house, so reception is good.  I am easily able to stream content without any issues.  Just make sure your internet speed is higher than 15/5.  Mine is 50/25 which is recommended anyway if you plan on streaming movies and TV shows.Rented Oblivion last night in HD and after calibrating the TV with my Disney WOW calibration Blu-ray.  In a word....INCREDIBLE!!  Colors were vibrant, shadow detail was the best I've seen in a flat panel TV and black levels surpassed my old Samsung plasma.  If you are like I was and are sitting on the fence about buying this TV, rest assured, it does not disappoint!  I am not an avid TV viewer, but I find myself really getting into it now with this larger 70\" set.  With my surround sound set up and this new TV, it actually felt like I was in a movie theater last night.

The following fix which works great for me may not work for you but it is offered nonetheless:1) Cut up a 1 1/2\" x 4\" piece of cardboard.2) Wrap the cardboard with aluminum foil3) Crease the cardboard at a 45 degree angle4) Tape the cardboard to the back of the set directly behind the sensor with the open angle pointing toward your seating area.5) Test the remote from various positions in the roomIf you are one of those who do not want to do this because it detracts from the visual aesthetics of the TV, then by all means continue to whine about the remote or return the TV.For those who are so frustrated with the remote's operation but otherwise like the TV enough to compromise the beauty that is a VIZIO product, then I hope this helps.Update on 27 Dec 2013:  Have had this 50\" VIZIO now for two weeks.  With the exception of the user interface for the Amazon Prime App (it sucks), this TV has performed perfectly.

Almost every review out there says Samsung is the company to watch for SmartTVs and LG is the close second. Every review I read said Vizio is cheap and ok for the money but not great.  Samsung has these cool features like being able to control your TV with gestures or voice commands. But I was looking for a 32\" TV and Samsung's lower priced 32\" TVs were 1080p with 60Hz and the higher priced one is almost double the cost of the Vizio M321i. Amazon has a great return policy so I thought I'd take a chance with the Vizio M321i and I'm glad I did.  In a brightly lit sun-drenched room the screen looks great.  For setup I plugged in a keyboard to type in email addresses and passwords - I thought about getting a wireless keyboard for the future but haven't found a need for it.There are three ways this TV could be improved:1. Include an internet browser.2. Allow fast switching between apps (e.g., between Netflix and Amazon so I don't have reload each time).3. Don't show apps in the store that are not compatible with this TV.It's nice looking. The picture is exceptional. The sound is ok. The remote is easy to use.

Hill", "ReviewID": "R1OTQ5QNQQO2EP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "While the picture quality displayed on this television is impressive, and its smart TV functions are mostly good (the Amazon Instant Video app was the only one I thought was terrible), I'm afraid I can't recommend this TV, especially if you intend to use this model for gaming. That's because this TV will blur and smear colors in dark scenes.On default settings, images are surrounded by a blue aura that smears across the screen at the slightest hint of motion. By fiddling with the color temperature settings I managed to reduce this, but now the colors green and red smear. I thought I could live with it, but it's highly annoying and it destroys the mood in games that rely on creating atmosphere. It's distracting when, for example, in a horror game you come across a pool of blood that blurs and smears. Then you turn around and the edges of the door smears so much that you have to wonder if the character you're playing is on acid.This is most noticeable in games, but it is also present during TV viewing. In one show, a character left a trail of red smear as he walked down a dark hallway. This also happens when using the TVs built-in apps, so the problem is not with the HDMI cables.I do not know if this is a flaw in all Vizio TVs, just the M series, or just this particular model. I seriously regret buying this TV. I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because, other than the smearing, this TV is amazing. It just so happens that the smearing makes this TV unsuitable for the function I purchased it to fulfill.", "Date": "February 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing Picture. Cheap remote. Not for gaming. Has Amazon, YouTube and other streaming apps built in.", "Author": "PMC", "ReviewID": "RCGG3PMSUZDXP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a joy to watch, but painful to use. The upside is I've never seen a picture this good in this price range--better than even higher cost models. The downside is the remote control, and the unit's slow response time to the remote control. Apparently Vizio decided to make the best possible screen, and cut costs everywhere else.And don't lose the remote--there isn't even an on/off button on the unit--it's a screen with an incredibly thin bezel on a reasonably strong stand, period. The remote will not work at all beyond about 5 feet away. This is doubly frustrating because the response is slow even when you are in range--it's sometime difficult to tell if the unit is just taking time to respond or simply didn't get the remote signal.The remote itself is cheaply made, and I found myself repeatedly pressing buttons just to do one thing. The remote is back-lit, so you can see what you're doing in the dark--a nice idea, except you have to press a button to get the light to turn on--which means pointing away from the unit to press a button just to get the back light, then pressing the button you actually want.The physical set-up of the unit is a bit labor-intensive--once you figure out how to attach the stand, i.e., you have to turn the unit on its face (I did this on a bed) then attach the stand--the unit is not heavy, but still awkward to deal with.The Remote has 3 buttons dedicated to NETFLIX, AMAZON, and something called MGO. Using a button in the center of the remote brings up all the wireless content providers--assuming you're setup with your WiFi source, which did not take me long, and was no more complicated than setting up a Roku box.Occasionally on boot-up the unit will display \"looking for updates.\" This may mean it could add digital sources at sometime in the future...maybe. For now the options are: Netflix, Facebook, Rhapsody, MGO, YouTube, Yahoo sports, Vudu, Yahoo profile, Yahoo weather, Yahoo news, flickr, Yahoo finances, HuluPlus, Twitter, and WebVideos.YouTube videos have a neat function--instead of using the unit's search function, you can find the YouTube video you want on your PC, then type a series of numbers, and the TV will play whatever it is you have on your PC. I have not been able to get similar function from the other available sources.The sound quality is OK, loud enough, but no low end. You'll want some kind of external sound system for any immersive experience.Lastly, I had problems with the unit playing games--there is a noticeable lag in response to the game controller--the screen doesn't tear, ghost, or judder, it just doesn't respond in true real-time. This is not a problem with any other viewing except gaming. I can't recommend for gaming.For one of the best pictures with a built-in \"Roku\" capability at this price point, this is it. For the worst interface, this is also it. I haven't had it long enough to know about reliability--I fear the remote will not last long--even one drop on the floor would finish it off. I gave it 5 stars because what it does do well is does very well-- I just accepted the slow interface and cheap remote", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Office TV great except for the signal detection", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"NTN\"", "ReviewID": "R32QAU9UDX7XMW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this TV for my office, it is essentially on in the background with the news on all the time.

I don't really use the TV for watching shows or movies, so after playing with the streaming for a day or so, I stopped using that aspect of it.Given the purpose of the TV, I would have given this a 5 star rating except for my recent issues with the TV's signal detection. Essentially, when you turn on the TV it looks for a video signal and if it doesn't detect one, it will turn itself off. This has only started happening in the last month, so I'm not sure what has changed (bought it in June). I make sure to turn on the cable box first (and I know it's on) and then turn the TV on. The picture comes in with no sound and then within 5 seconds the picture goes out and throws the no signal detected and then turns itself off.  If I turn the TV on and off enough times, sometimes this takes up to 5 times, it will eventually stay on. Once its on, it's on all day and everything works great.I have scrolled through the menu options to see if this signal detection is something I can just disable, but I don't see it.

Guy couldn't even get it up 3 steps into my living room.  I was not home at the time so my mom took the delivery and had to help get the TV into the house.  I wasn't expecting this or else I would have had it delivered at a time I could be there.  The dates available for delivery were only Monday through Thursday, which makes no sense to me, and the window of delivery is all day so anyone who works basically can't use the service.  After you schedule it they then give you a smaller window of time (still six hours) that they will be there at, but at the time of scheduling it is open to any time throughout the day.  No mention of needing to be there to help the delivery man get the TV inside, or setup the TV.  Also, the enhanced delivery company crossed off the two man delivery on the delivery slip in black marker, hoping I wouldn't notice.  He lied to my mother about taking the packaging materials which was requested to be taken away, he responded saying that there would be no way to return the product if it was faulty.  This is a blatant lie after reviewing the amazon.com details on enhanced delivery more carefully, it states that if the TV is defective and has to go back the enhanced delivery company will retain the box and come pick it up.  The delivery person said that putting the TV on it's stand was not on his checklist and he refused to do that.  He also would not turn the TV on to check to see if it would start up.  Not to mention he got mud/dirt all over the front of the TV screen and around the edges, on my brand new TV!

If you have the TV mounted on a wall with a clear visual line of site, then it probably wasn't an issue, but we have the remote sitting on top of a cabinet on the stand that came with the TV so the clearance is / was only about 4-5\" and you had to *work* at getting the remote to work with the TV.The great thing about this TV is because it has Wi-fi built-in, it can check with Vizio headquarters / tech center on the internet and download firmware / software updates.What you probably don't know is that the TV also has Blue-tooth and that the remote that came with the TV has a built-in Blue-tooth transmitter.Sometime last night, Vizio put out the new firmware that changes your TV and remote to work with the built-in Blue-Tooth, which didn't work before ... but low and behold, when I turned on the TV this morning, my TV had downloaded the firmware update and on the screen was the \"setup\" screen for setting up the remote now to work with Blue-Tooth. Within about 15 seconds the TV updated the remote and system and now the remote works perfectly even when I am 30 feet away from the TV and not even pointing the remote at the TV.An extra added bonus is during the setup, the TV asked if I would also like the configure the remote to work with my Direct TV HD Receiver. Previously the remote didn't work properly with my Direct TV receiver and I HAD to use the remote provided by Direct TV to do anything with the receiver.Now, not only does the remote work perfectly with the TV but also completely controls the Direct TV HD Receiver as well!IMPORTANT: If you want your TV to do the firmware update, you must:A.) Have the TV connected to the internet via either the built-in Wifi or with an internet LAN line cable andB.) Go into the \"System Menu\" on the TV's menu and select \"Service Check\" in the settings menu. Once you do that, the next time you turn your TV off for an hour or so, the TV *should* download the firmware update. If you haven't done any firmware updates on the TV, it might have to download and install several of the firmware updates that are available before it gets to the one that fixes the *remote* problem.Hope you find this information helpful if you are already a Vizio owner trying to get the remote to work properly, or if you are considering buyer a Vizio and wanted some real honest advice....

Video games play smooth and clean.  The price was also a very strong deal and Amazon \"while glove\" delivery via CEVA was just fine.  It was nice to have them setup the TV and let me verify it was working before leaving.  They also took all of the packing stuff; box, styrofoam, etc. away.The look of the TV is super high end with a VERY small bezel and the stand is well designed and very solid. Internet apps work well enough and picture quality for Amazon and VUDU is good.  Also, we were watching an old B&W; show in 4:3 from Amazon and the TV was able to scale it full screen and make it look 5x better than in its native format; really impressive and a great surprise.The one real issue is the remote control.  It is well designed and feels good in the hand BUT the IR signal is very very weak meaning you have to point and hold the remote at just the right angle for a key press to work.  It is really frustrating and even more so on such an otherwise high end TV.  I did read some reviews of the TV that indicated the remote was really a WiFi based unit like the Roku 3 is and I did see reference to this in the TV's on screen 'System Information' screen but no way to turn it on.  I did a live chat with Vizio support and they said it does have a WiFi remote but the TV needs a firmware update to enable it and they did not know when it might be released.  A dark cloud on an otherwise wonderful TV.If you can get over the poor remote then 100% buy this unit.  If the remote will ruin it for you then look for other options or wait until they release the WiFi remote update.UPDATE:  I looked on the Vizio Facebook page and several people have posed asking for an update on the WiFi remote issue and the only response from Vizio was to the effect of \"Thank you for your comments.  We can't say when/if any updates will be made available and we won't comment on why the original timeline [Vizio PR had previously said Summer 2013] has been missed.  Sorry.\"  Not a good sign, IMO.UPDATE FEB2014:  Our TV developed a defect in the LCD and Vizio replaced it.  Amazing and wonderful experience.  It took a total of 10 min of my time and 1 hour total from my first Chat with support to a confirmed replacement order being processed.  The new TV was delivered in about a week via 'white glove' delivery which picked up the old unit and placed the new unit.  SUPER ADDED BONUS: The replacement TV had newer firmware and the remote now works in its WiFi mode and is a million times better than before!!!!

I watched Baylor win the Big 12 championship yesterday on a friend's Samsung (same size and year), and I regretted not spending the extra $200-$300 for a significantly nicer picture.---I received my M401i-A3 40\" Vizio HDTV yesterday.

While some might categorize this TV's razor-thin design as \"marketing,\" I find its super thin, sleek design to be critically important value added to the already stunning picture.  A TV is something you're obviously going to look at--why buy one that has a thick ugly border?  This TV's image is enhanced by a razor thin border.  1080p / 120 Hz is also beautiful combination right out of the box.  The only drawback we've noticed is that scanning between apps and typing using a remote can be frustratingly slow, so we'll probably be buying a universal remote with keyboard--wireless keyboards unfortunately can not be paired with this TV.Having spent weeks digging through online sale opportunities for 40-46\" 1080p HDTV's, we're happy we went with this one.", "Date": "June 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrible black levels, lots of light bleeding in from edges", "Author": "RG \"RG\"", "ReviewID": "R2S5JHV9WX8AAF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "TV arrived in good condition within a week of ordering using Ceva Logistics.Sadly, the TV screen edges leak a lot of light from the edges - yes, it is edge-lit LED, and the overall effect is very poor.

I'll talk about the TV first and the packaging second. The initial picture looked a little strange to me so I went to CNET'S webpage and looked up their optimized picture settings and it looks perfect now. On a side note, I also turned off 'Smooth Motion' which made the TV look too life like for me. EVERYONE hates the controller on this TV, and having just received my TV, I can confirm it's pretty crappy, but I figured who cares since it's going to work over the Wi-Fi when I get it. Wrong! (Update: According to Vizio, the Wi-Fi and universal remote capabilities won't be available initially; instead they will be activated via an automatic Internet-delivered update sometime during the summer.) This still has yet to happen. So for now you're stuck with the crappy IR remote which is a 2/10 as far as remote scoring goes. I haven't had any problems with the internet connection dropping or light bleed, but I will update my post as time goes on. Overall, I think the TV is exceptional, except for the remote and the choice by Vizio to go with Yahoo Apps (what were they thinking?). Oh, if you're an Amazon Prime junkie, you might want to look at other reviews that mention the app is horrible on this TV and it doesn't look like it's going to be fixed anytime soon.Packaging (Note: I didn't lower my stars for the TV based on packaging condition)I've ordered a lot of things from Amazon and have never been more disappointed in the condition of a package I received. The delivery people even commented that they had never seen packaging in such bad shape. When it arrived at the local warehouse to be delivered it was WET, TORN, and in generally subpar condition. I would expect careful handling of a 1,750 dollar TV. I think I deserve that. On the edges, the packaging was completely torn through all the way to the TV. The TV appears to be undamaged but who knows if the treatment it received on shipment ruined its lifespan. Only time will tell.

Figured that out as I was on my couch getting frustrated but then my little daughter picked up the remote from about a foot underneath me and changed the volume easily. Now I know you just have to be point up from a little lower than the bottom of the TV. Even across the room this works fine. And the remote itself is not bad, I find it easy to use and quick to enter info like Netflix log in info.The light bleed is very real, just started noticing that as the Hobbit is now on HBO and at the beginning and some dark scenes it's kind of distracting. This is also true when you're watching something darker and you change the volume (or call up TV info like time/input). The bottom (or top) of screen gets noticably brighter as it has to light up to project the volume indicator. I had a 6 year old Sony LCD and since it wasn't edgelit this never occured. I still don't know how bad this TV is comapred to other LED LCD's; some reviews say all edge lit LED LCD's do this, some say that there are sets that don't have this issue. But those are likely double the price, so...Apps are fantastic. HBOGO and Showtime Anytime would be nice, but Netflix and Amazon work really well and are very quick. This TV's apps are much quicker than they were are my Xbox 360 where buffering was a constant problem watching movies. Also, read some negative stuff on here about the YouTube app? I thought it was fantastic. Wanted to pull up some key and peele videos, I entered Ke and it auto populated what I needed next. Layout is cool, different than computers or other YouTube apps I've seen but I'd say this is a 10/10 for the limited times I've used it. Apps are great so far on this TV.The Smoothmotion thing is very difficult to watch TV with. The Shining was on IFC last night and it looked like Shelly Duval was speaking and moving her head in fast forward with the setting on HIGH (I was switching between Sunday Night Football so wanted it on for that). I find it very distracting and I don't like having to change settings when I change channels. Though this is probably not an issue with just this TV - go to retailer that has many TV's setup and you'll notice the 'Soap Opera' affect on display with many models. But for having a 240hz refresh rate, it still has some pixelation problems. Watch Life of Pi and you'll notice the water in the ocean surrounding the boat is all pixelated, which is very distracting.TV looks great though, fit and finish are first class. From pricing things out this TV is decent for a $1000, I'm just struggling with possibly returning and spending another $200 or so to not have to worry about where I point my remote and having to change settings when I change channels. I just get the feeling that Vizio is really stretching to provide this much TV with this many features at this price.

I love how the picture looks and the different options that allows you to play around with how the picture looks, as well as the audio.I ESPECIALLY love how how it allows me to play videos that I have loaded up on my USB flash drive (TV actually comes with 2 USB ports). So far, it has played just about every video format i placed on the drive, such as MP4, AVI, and M4V...however, I haven't tried WMV. I also didn't realize when I bought the TV, but it also comes with DLNA that allows you to wirelessly stream videos and audio from your computer. I only found this out, when I was playing around with my settings, and it listed my Macbook as a source play videos. I use Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime, so I love that the TV has these apps preloaded for that. The 3D function looks great, and you can toggle it on/off with just a simple push of a button. I have this 70' TV mounted, and despite my fear of the size of the TV taking my wall apart, the weight of TV (or lack of) makes you feel extremely comfortable placing this monster of a TV on any wall.HOWEVER, there are only a few small gripes that I have about this TV, but def. not big enough to change my star rating from 5-Stars.  The first thing you should do when you purchase this TV is to DESTROY the remote control that it comes with. Replace it with a universal remote or Harmony, etc., but the remote that the TV comes with is a piece of crap. I say this, because the remote has to be directly pointed at the sensor  of the TV (which is located on the far left, in order to control the volume, power, menu, etc. Depending on where I sit on the couch, I had to sometime contort my arms so the Remote signal can reach the TV. I thought that maybe it was the batteries, so I replaced them with brand new batteries, but the same issues came about. I was then afraid it was TV itself that caused this, and not the remote, so I went to Best Buy to pick up a $15 universal remote control, and guess what?.....The problem disappeared!! Once again, $15 dollars from Best Buy fixed my problem..haha!! I loved some of the buttons that the 'original' remote had, such as the 'Netflix' and 'Hulu' direct buttons, so I just used the learning function on the universal remote to learn those Netflix/Hulu buttons. Now I can point my remote anywhere, and the TV will respond to it.  I am also not a huge fan of the audio of the TV, despite it being better than my LG TV that I have in my living room, but to be honest, I don't know too many Flatscreen TVs out there on the market that has great audio in the first place. I hooked up a Soundbar to it using a Optical Cable, and now it sounds amazing.  One very small gripe that I have, as well, is that it has very minium number of Apps to use, compared to both LG and Samsung TV, which I also own. This is just me being a little bit nitpicky, since it Does, however, comes with the basics such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, Rhapsody, Vudo, and Youtube....But, both of my LG and Samsung TVs has all of this plus 30 more apps, including a browser that allows you to search the web on your TV, but when you look at the price difference from the Vizio compared to the Samsung/LG TVs, the cost alone might be worth the sacrifice of a few extra apps. Once again, if you're just satisfied with just using Youtube and Netflix, then please, ignore everything I just mentioned.All in all, I love this TV. despite, the small gripes I listed above, I'm still able to live with myself giving this TV a 5-Star rating. My friends always want to watch movies and football games at my place, because they love the look of my TV.

If you can get a good deal on the M801d-A3, take it because the TVs are the same.I would have scoffed at buying a Vizio just a few years ago. For larger sets, I've previously purchased LED back lit LCDs compared to edge lit (e.g., LNT5781F). I wanted something larger than 57\" and back lit LCDs are not widely available these days.I compared several 70-75\" offerings from Samsung and Sony like the UN75F7100 and KDL-70R550A. I went to Best Buy and HH Gregg and tried to do side-by-side comparisons as best I could. Neither store would let me play my own content but I liked the picture on the Samsung UN75F7100 a bit better. I then went to Costco and looked at the Vizio M 80\". It surprised me how good it looked and for about $1,700 less than the UN75F7100 (at the time) for a larger screen. The size difference also seemed significant to me.I decided to give it a try and I bought one from Amazon that had less 3D glasses included than this version (M801d-A3).  After price match at Sam's Club website (which Amazon still does on TVs), the final price was $2,788 (yes for the 80\"). Vizio had a $500 instant rebate at the time that stores seemed to implement differently. Sam's factored it into the final price of $3288. Amazon had it for $3799 and then gave a Prime discount of $500 after it was added to the cart and did not consider it part of the selling price. Costco called it an \"instant rebate\" and had the price of $3,999 before rebate. Therefore, Amazon price matched Sam's price of $3288 and another $500 came off after it was in my cart for a Prime discount.  The total was $2,788.00 + tax.Delivery was impressive and two people showed up and took it up 2 flights of stairs without issue. The TV is a lot lighter than my 57\" Samsung from 2008 which is one of the advantages of edge-lit TVs.Performance seems very good since I hooked it up in October 2013. Angles are good. Passive 3D from blu-ray is very good. The size is amazing. I like the picture a little better on my back lit LED LCDs but this is only with direct comparison and most would find the picture phenomenal.There is clouding that is apparent on most edge-lit sets and this is no different. It is however well mitigated by one of Vizio's internal settings in the Advanced Menu.  I turned \"Smart Dimming\" to On.The smart apps are nice and it has Amazon Prime video out-of-the box but I decided not to deal with the HDMI return channel to the receiver for surround sound so I just use the smart apps built into my blu-ray that has control via iOS and Android.There has been reports of poor IR reception with the stock remote. The reception is probably fine but the IR receiver of the TV is *under* the bottom bezel on the left instead of on the front. Your mileage may vary depending on how the TV is mounted relative to your seating position. For example, if the TV is mounted above your seating position (like above a fireplace) you will likely have no problem with the stock remote. Regardless of placement, poor control via IR is completely mitigated by using a Harmony remote which likely has a stronger IR transmitter.  Others have put a small piece of metal under the IR receiver angled down and taped to the back of the set.There has also been some feedback about a lack of an on/off physical switch. There is a multi function button but it is not easy to find or use. It is unmarked and found on the rear, left side of the display about 1/8 of the way up and it needs to be depressed for about 5 seconds to power on the TV. I would have preferred a touch sensitive switch on the bottom bezel of the TV but for everything else that this TV does well, I can live without a better on/off switch.One thing that I really would like to see is a Vizio iOS and/or Android app to control the major functions of this TV (and smart apps). With the exception of Vizio, most other component manufacturers offer this feature (Marantz, Denon, TiVo, Sony, Panasonic, etc.).Overall for what I paid this is a great value for the performance/features. It is a reasonable size upgrade for the money that should hold its own for a few years until the OLED, 4K, (and even curved) displays drop.UPDATE 2/2014:  FYI: New Firmware V1.09.44.0090 improves the functioning of the stock remote.  It no longer needs to be positioned just right to hit the bottom left (when you are looking at the screen) of the bezel .  I believe it now uses wifi and therefore you can point it in almost any direction.  One other small note.  The TV seems to have changed the functionality of the rear multi-purpose button (in a good way).  Prior to the update, I had to hold the button in for a few seconds to get the TV to come on.  Page 47 of the instruction manual: \"Press the Power button on the remote or hold the Power control on the side of the TV to turn it on.\"  After the update, holding in the button triggers the remote pairing activity and to turn on the TV, all you need to do is hit the button on the back left side of the TV once, briefly.", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love Hate Relationship", "Author": "i-dude", "ReviewID": "R20PL3KUW7OOZP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this specifically to stream internet videos, and access over the air broadcasts.

I have a 42\" Olevia LCD that has lasted (and is still lasting) for 7 years and bought this because I have been researching LEDs for the last six months. I ended up purchasing this tv because this model just recently came out by Vizio and has an incredible array of features. It is not as slim as some of the ultra thin 1.25\" LEDs but 1.75\" is not bad at all. Plus the 240 HZ refresh rate is an added bonus as most LEDs come with 60 or 120 HZ. The 3D looks great because of this high refresh rate and the 1080p video looks excellent as well. My roommates have a 60\" LG LCD and a 55\" Samsung plasma and I think this Vizio LED has the best picture out of them all.The apps are easy to access and work great! After connecting to my wifi fairly easily and quickly, all the apps worked right out of the box. It is a bit of a hassle to sign into every account you have with the standard remote since there is no keyboard but it's not too awful. You do have to press a little hard on the buttons to get immediate response time, but I'm hoping that it'll be a lot easier after wearing in the remote a little. The sensor for the remote is located at the bottom left corner of the tv so I found that it does respond best when you point the remote in that general direction (duh!).So far I am in love with this LED tv even though it has only been two days since I bought it.

I have to change that opinion after having it for a few days.  I did finally return this Vizio. The picture is good if you are in a dark room.  If you have a window with bright light coming through you will have a little trouble seeing the picture on this set. It just isn't bright enough for bright rooms. Trying every adjustment I could think of helped very little.  I'm wondering why Vizio left the adaptive luma adjustment off of this model and feel that was a big mistake. It also doesn't have a richer color adjustment like some of the other models. It did seem to have very good color though without it.  I have a 42\" 3d model Vizio that stands up much better in brightly lit rooms. My 42\" model does have the adaptive luma adjustment on it and I like that feature. I thought the smart features on this model worked very well and it was fast getting to Netflix and some of the other sites. I loved the fact that it found my network extremely fast and that a display at the top of the screen shows how strong the wireless signal is. The built in clock was a good idea.  Anyway, I would only suggest buying this set if you don't have much light in the room you are placing it in.  As far as sound,  I think it is very good especially on the bass boost audio mode.  The tv is rather heavy for a 40\" flat panel and I do think that some of the weight is attributed to the built in subwoofer.  I was told by customer service that there is real metal in the tv housing and bezel.  I'm not sure this to be a fact though since some of the customer service people don't seem to know that much about this model. They are all nice though and you will have no trouble understanding what they say. One thing I want to add is about the remote.  I've read many reviews about how awful the remote is.  I actually liked it a lot. I like the fact it had backlighting  and it felt just right in my hand. I didn't have the problems of getting no response when I pushed the buttons so I don't know if I just happened to get a better remote than most everyone else or what.

First of all, it is very simple to set up. Takes less 10 minutes to unbox and put everything together. I was coming from a 4 year old 46\" samsung lcd 60 hz 70,000:1 contrast tv, and I wanted something that had a higher refresh rate and higher contrast. Im happy to say that this tv delivers. Blu-rays are sunningly sharp with high detail, deep blacks thanks to its smart dimming, and popping contrast. Now on to some of the cons. One of the first things I noticed when turning on the tv is there seems to be some light bleed in and around the corners of the tv. This has to do with the fact that this is an edge lit tv and I was aware that I might encounter that. It seems to be noticeable when ever you activate the menu while watching a movie, but because of the smart dimming feature, it dims the light to the point where you can barely see the light bleed while watching a movie. There are different presets for picture adjustments and standard seems to be my medium because it gives great picture quality and screen uniformity. The other presets, even a calibrated preset, seem to bleed out more light even after the dimming has taken affect, but it's nothing too severe. The 3D quality is pretty good and seems to have a decent amount of depth to it. Because it is passive, it gives you great picture quality without the dimming you get while wearing active glasses. While playing games in 3D however, there is some amount of lag, and this is while offline. My main issue is with the remote. It is a very unresponsive remote. I have to aim within the line of sight and press hard on the arrow keys and it takes multiple trys sometimes. I do howerver realise that VIZIO will have a firmware update that will allow your remote to be wifi enabled, so this issue can be resolved. Other than some of the issues I ha with this tv, it really is an amazing tv for the price and I am happy with my purchase.", "Date": "June 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice TV, a lot of features that you may or may not use, needs calibrated like any other TV", "Author": "jaycmw18", "ReviewID": "R3LUSY05QY5SXD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Previously, I owned a Sony Qualia 006 (Google it) so my expectations for a replacement television were high.  I know what makes a good television, and it boiled my blood having to get rid of the Qualia due to a bad optical block because I knew going in I'd be disappointed with any TV I bought sub $3,000.I settled on the Vizio M701d-A3R, and when I say settled I merely mean that the Vizio won the \"ennie meannie minnie moe\" game I played between all the other 70\" televisions out there.  It's difficult to window shop for these televisions or take advice on any reviews out there because they are so hit or miss.  You read some experts swear by Sony, other experts swear by Samsung, other experts say this TV blows the other ones out of the water, yadda yadda yadda.  Back to the whole window shopping thing, seriously...if your going to buy a TV based on how it looks at Best Buy your nuts.  It's amazing that ANY MANUFACTURER allows their televisions to be displayed the way they are at some of these retailers.  Right out of the box, ANY OF THESE TV'S look like hammered s***.So back to the Vizio.  I unbox it, turn it on and I immediately have buyers remorse. Seriously - every manufacturer of TV's - why do you ship these televisions \"calibrated\" the way you do?  Do you have a monkey program the video settings and you say looks great let's ship them?  I highly recommend you Google Vizio M701d-A3R video settings and find a calibration setting that is appropriate for you.Calibrated DarkBrightness:  52Contrast:  73Color:  53Tint:  0Sharpness: 20Color temperature: NormalAuto Brightness:  MediumEverything under Advanced picture Off except Film Mode: AutoI haven't really messed around with the Smart Apps all that much.  I have an HTPC, which makes the Smart Apps useless.  The one time I used the Smart Apps, I tried the YouTube app and my TV promptly froze with the first video I tried.  After the TV froze, I couldn't turn it off.  Wonderful.  I had to pull the power cord and wait 15 seconds, plug it back in, then it started working again.  So yea - screw the Smart Apps.  I didn't buy this TV for that....The remote is comically terrible, as others have pointed out in numerous reviews.  The same person or monkey who checks the video calibration settings must also check the remote.3D - I didn't buy this for that either...but the few I've watched so far are actually pretty cool.  I just have nothing to compare it too so I can't really say how good it is.  I'll just say that the few that I have seen have left me wanting to watch more 3D.  Who knows how long 3D will be around, but I'm liking it on this set.Sound - who cares...if you bought this type of TV and don't have surround sound your just getting what you deserve.Network - it does hook up to your network but you cannot stream videos from your PC.  Setup an HTPC or hook your laptop up to your TV if you want to do that kind of stuff.How does it look once it's calibrated?  It's not bad, not bad at all.  I don't have any light bleeding or bright spots - my only issues so far are darker scenes especially when there is a flickering light for example there was a movie scene where the room was completely dark but they were huddled near a fire.  This could be caused by my auto brightness setting.Vizio is supposed to release 4K TV's later this year for under $2,000....I've heard as early as May but I'm thinking August/September until they are ready to ship.  I just couldn't wait that long since my old TV basically had to be brought out back and shot.  There's also limited content for 4K....and there's an issue with how to get 4K content to your home.  If you think back to what HDTV was in 1999, that's sort of where 4K is in my mind.

We've enjoyed watching movies in 3D (and if you didn't already know, to watch 3D BlueRay movies - logically you need to have a 3D BluRay player).My gripe is with the remote. It is marked as having a remote that works over WiFi but it doesn't. In fact, the instructions clearly state, \"Press and hold the red Record button and green Hotkey button for 5 seconds to pair the Wi-Fi Direct remote. Select the name of your wireless network from the list of available networks and press OK.\" You can do the first step but not the second. Without WiFi the remote is very lousy.

This is by far the best feature of this tv. Despite the claim that the tv isn't a true 120Hz tv, sports and video games are spectacular. Everything moves the way they're supposed to.Some reviewers have complained about the viewing angle. I don't know why. Once this thing arrived and I set it up I tested out every angle I could, even if it wasn't practical to actually watching the tv and couldn't figure out what they were talking about. Another complaint I don't quite understand was glare. It has a glare, it is minimal. I also haven't known a device with a screen that when placed in the sun doesn't have a glare, but I'm not a tech connoisseur so what do I know.So the visuals are great. The sound... not so great. Most of the time the sound is more than adequate. It doesn't have great booming sound. It is a 32in tv, it's not meant for your living room. The real complaint though is that you'll notice that with sporting events that crowd noise is off occasionally and every so often you'll notice something doesn't sound right in your favorite tv program. None of the sound maladies are consistent. The vast majority of the time you'll be happy. But when it's off, it's off and you'll definitely notice. The missing star in the rating above is completely sound related.The only other issue at hand is the remote. Yes, it sucks, You have to be slow and deliberate when pushing the buttons. There isn't a keyboard. It is back lit so you can see it when it's dark. You can replace it. Reviews of other remotes claim they work with this model. But all in all is this really a big deal? Chances are you have cable or satellite and you use a different remote 90% of the time. If you're in a position where the remote is important to you take off another star.All in all this is a good unit. Especially for the price.

Again, uses the non-powered movie theater type 3D glasses. The only way to do 3D in the home.**UPDATE 6/20/13*************Could not be happier with this set. I realized something I had thought was only applicable to the 240hz  LG brand tv's,  had thought that LG gave a more realistic sharp crisp picture than other brand Tv's. WRONG! The thing is, vizio as well as my other 55\" LG both have 240hz and both share the same crystal clear picture. It's like you are there while they were filming. Hard to explain. You have to experience it. But the fact the tv is 240hz as opposed to 120hz makes a huge difference. Produces a life-like picture. As if you are there with your own camcorder doing the filming. In a way it takes away the mystery of film and acting. Kind of like making a home movie. It's the 240hz effect, I guess, since both my 240hz tv's share this video clarity. Cool in a way, but very obvious difference compared to 120hz tv's.Other than that observation, this vizio 65\" is fun to watch, a nice 65\" big screen, nice features, very responsive.And I still can't get over the thin bezel surrounding the screen sure does add to a near frameless picture, and how that makes the picture even more stunning.************************************I \"almost\" and would have bought from amazon, but came across an \"open boxed\" item at a local store for hundreds off retail. Could not pass that deal up.Amazon does great at delivering big tv's. I also have an 55\" LG I did buy from amazon. But when I could save $350 more off the asking price with local in-store \"open-box\", well... what can I say?Planed on wall mounting. So opened the box, sat the tv on the floor with not yet using stand, just to first test everything out, and discovered not getting tv response from the remote (which is a backlit-keys remote). Would not power-on the tv. Then I discovered the small on-off button on the TV \"backside\" at lower left. That manual power-on button worked. Why no remote response? Discovered after some time getting annoyed with the remote, that by now I was sure was broken, that the tv's pickup sensor on the tv was located very low on the screen edge. Probably because the frame around this tv is so thin. The floor carpet I rested the tv on, standing up and leaning against a table, that the tv's remote sensor was being blocked by the tall carpet.Gesh... One of those days I guess.So the remote was actually working and indeed fine after all. Floor carpet was blocking the tv pickup sensor.After power-on, going thru the on-screen guided tv set-up of the Wf-Fi connection, and going thru the online registration, all was fine. Having not connected to a video source yet, I went into the tv apps first off, VUDU. Tested both standard quality tv, HD quality and finally 3D quality using VUDU, I realized this tv was stunning in all aspects.And YES, this screen size (65\") is plenty big, having come from a 55\" screen I wondered if the added screen real-estate would be worth the screen size upgrade?IT WAS !!!! Huge difference 55\" vs 65\".And since this vizio M65 screen does pretty much extend edge-to-edge, with the tiny small frame around the picture, the tv looks practically like there is no frame at all. Absolutely a stunning picture. 3D looks like you could walk right into the screen. Yes the screen is a glass substance where it reflects a bit. HOWEVER... when setting the screen brightness to \"vivid\" in the menu, you can hardly detect any reflection. This was in a bright daytime room with a wall of windows. TV viewing and screen reflection was not an issue. Close the drapes, and reflection was eliminated. In other words, don't hard knock this tv just because you fear reflection issues. Just set to the picture to \"VIVID\" in a bright daylight room, or close the drapes and reduce the picture brightness down to \"standard\".But VIVID does give a stunning picture, regardless.The 3D...This vizio M65 3D-TV uses the \"passive\" 3D system to deliver great stunning 3D viewing, meaning it uses the very same NON-battery powered 3D glasses used in 3D movie theaters of today.So you can collect as many 3D glasses as you will ever need.And if the kids should break a set, no big deal. No huge financial loss. You can find plenty more of these 3D glasses for only pennies each.And having no battery or expense to deal with using 3D glasses will mean pure 3D heaven.I cannot believe or imagine why anyone would get anything other than passive 3D.Passive 3D delivers the same excellent 3D viewing experience.And after all... it's good enough for the movie theaters to use.One reason I wanted this particular TV was reading the aspect ratio being that of the movie theater ratio of \"true\" wide-screen 16x9. The screen size of this vizio is NOT your typical 1:85 big screen ratio. This is a true movie theater 16x9 wide screen. And that in itself was stunning to experience vs the usual 1:85 screen sized so called wide screen tv's.Add in the large selection of built-in apps including VUDU, AMAZON VIDEO, HULU-PLUS, and NETFLIX. All the movie channel apps you want but seldom find all together in one single TV.Heavier when compared to the typical 65\" LCD tv's. Very solid build.And the pretty much totally flat TV back-side, so this TV can be mounted closer to the wall with the correct 3rd party wall-mount bracket for slim tv's.Fully built in Wi-Fi, \"Not\" an USB add-on dongle. 4 HDMI ports. Nice to-the-point built-in menu system, including the user manual built-into the menu for access.The user manual can also be found online in PDF format.Full of features, with true 16x9 screen ratio, plus some fantastic picture, and with \"\"'PASSIVE\"\"\" 3D, all for such a reasonable price.This makes my 2nd Vizio (32\" and this 65\").", "Date": "June 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "WOW!

We tried fresh batteries - no difference.  Power button, channel selector, volume control do not work until it re-initializes by taking out the batteries.

It will also open the menu to select Amazon prime, netflix, etc.  The DirecTV remote will not open any of the menu choices to adjust TV settings.  you still need the Vizio remote for controlling those functions.UPDATE 8/18/13 - Vizio sent a new remote for the M401i-A3.  The new remote has worked perfectly since it arrived a week ago.  The one that came with the TV was defective.

It is replacing Vizio's original XVT 240Hz (240Hz claim requires an asterisk) offering we purchased about 3 years ago. (CNET Editor's Choice, wireless SmartTV w/exceptional pic). The XVT still performs flawlessly (still love it), moving it to another room. New (to us) house, wanted a bigger set for main TV.Last summer we hung Vizio's M3D470KDE in the master bedroom. At $688, may best the best overall value on the market. I continue to be impressed with what a great buy that TV has proven to be.When shopping for a new TV, I looked at the new E series Vizio on repeated occasions over the last few months.Just couldn't pull the trigger.I found them underwhelming. I thought maybe Vizio had fumbled the ball. The previous generation XVT and M3D are both a better products than the E series (my opinion).Then I read about about the M series being launched, and decided to wait.The wait was well worth it, the new M has exceeded my expectations. It deserves the accolades it is receiving.Elegant design (even the remote), simple plug and play set up, easy/painless wireless connection, nicely designed back panel for hanging on a wall (without protruding connections), ample array of picture tweeks/customization.Sound is very acceptable. By now we should all understand that sound from these flat panels is not going to blow your mind. Vizio has made it easy to add Home Theater by incorporating the new HDMI with Audio Return Channel.The remote is also elegantly designed. It's Bluetooth (don't have to point it right at the TV). It's also lighted. Good ergonomic feel.Although, I do kind of miss the sliding QWERTY keyboard of the the brick-ish remote that came with Vizio's XVT.I didn't measure it, but it appears the new Vizio M takes up less space than the old 47\" XVT it is replacing.Although - the older XVT does have a better matte finish on the screen. There is more glare coming from this M series (although it likely compares favorably to it's competition). Certainly not a deal breaker.The picture is simply stunning.We have nice Panasonic plasma in the basement and this picture, and it's blacks/contrast, rivals that of the Panasonic.Without question, the new M series is another major win for Vizio.And, I tip my hat Vizio for changing the TV landscape. Continuing to bring really exceptional values to the market time and time again.The M551d-A2R is a beautiful TV with an outstanding picture.If you want to save a cool $500, check out the M3D470KDE.

Don't get me wrong, this TV is good, but not great.The picture quality on HD content is very good, but honestly does not compare to my 4 year old Samsung UNC-9000 series, a 55\" set.  I have tried both with identical content, HD channels, blue rays, Netflix HD movies, and honestly the Samsung comes out on top every time.The GOOD:  1) Price - You simply can not beat this TV for the price, there is nothing else out there that even comes close, unless you are of the mindset that $200-$300 is close (Its not ).  2) Style - This is a classy, stylish TV that definitely has a high end look, unlike all previous Vizio tvs in my opinion anyway.  It is thin, but not crazy thin like some models.  It is a nearly frame less design, which all the flagship tvs are now, with an aluminum look plastic stand that works design wise.  I would be happy to pay a bit more for a swivel stand, but I digress.  I get many compliments on the look of this tv.  It doesnt look like a Vizio, and that is a good thing.  3)  High tech -  All the high end goodies you would expect on a flagship tv are here:  240hz, great 3d (with 8 glasses), nice remote, bunch of apps (no real need for a separate streaming box), plenty of input connections too.Ok, now for the BAD, and this is just what I have found after owning for it for 1 month:1)  The touchy remote:  You have to aim this remote at the lower left corner of the tv like a sniper, or it simply wont work.  Common complaint on this TV, but it is a highly accurate, and apparent universal complaint with this Vizio.  It is very annoying, and nearly impossible to get used to how bad it actually is.2)  Super slow processor:  Especially when dealing with apps, such as Netflix, this TV takes waaaay toooooo loooong loading.  An $80 Roku box runs circles around this TV in the \"Smart\" department, and while you don't expect it to be nearly as slick as a Roku, you also don't expect snail pace, as if this is the first Smart TV on the planet.  It also freezes up on occasion and you have to shut the TV off and turn it back on, when dealing with surfing content on Netflix, Amazon prime, etc.3)  Another small, but consistent annoyance is every time the tv is turned on, the video comes up first, and then 8-10 seconds later the audio finally arrives on scene.  This may only be on my tv but this is a bad oversight on Vizios part if this is consistent across the entire M series.4)  The picture:  although this is the best picture you will find outside of a plasma for the price, don't get it twisted - this is still not quite on par with Samsung, LG, or Sony in the beautiful picture department.  It is a very good picture, but real tv nerds will spot its not quite up there.  Kind of like a Hyundai Genesis, its still not quite a BMW or Mercedes, no matter how hard it tries :)", "Date": "May 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "The TV has a high defect rate.", "Author": "Ryan Clark", "ReviewID": "R1W2MS0O55VUB4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Prior to spending $3,997 with tax on a TV I read as many reviews i could find.

I have had the TV set up in my family room now for about 2 weeks and I've seen enough at this point to share my thoughts on it.If you're anything like me, you don't like getting ripped off... so ways that we avoid getting ripped off is by taking the time to read reviews from several sources (such as Amazon & CNET) to try to get a consensus perspective of a product before we commit to the purchase. I did that, for about 3 weeks before I made the commitment to go with the Vizio and it did it for a few reasons. It was NOT an easy choice at all, so I hope that my reasons align with yours and it gives you a bit of perspective when you make the decision to buy this set or another.1. I strongly considered other options. I studied the Samsung PN64F8500 for its superior picture. I saw it in person at Best Buy, and while I was certainly impressed, I wasn't too excited about losing that extra 6\" (insert genital joke here.) In addition to the Samsung flagship plasma, I also strongly considered the Samsung UN65F8000 which provided 1 extra inch (insert genital joke here) and the warm and tingly feeling of doing more for the environment with an LED lit television. The barrier here with both Samsung models was size and cost mostly.2. You may have heard the rumblings of the Vizio P Series and Reference Series televisions that are to be released this year at some point. Well, I strongly considered waiting for more information on those models to include the price and projected release dates. Couple issues I had with it - the m701 had been out for a while and plenty of reviews already existed to support the quality, by most accounts, and I personally don't like being a guinea pig when it comes to my big ticket items. So the lack of release information became an issue for me, but the fact that Vizio did away with 3D with their 2014 models killed it for me personally. I am sure that maybe 60% or more people could care less about that, but I really enjoy 3D and have a lot of content in 3D, so this was a real buzz kill. While these sets are 4K ready, to me, 4K doesn't really move the needle. I have seen demonstrations on it at Best Buy and yes, it looks fantastic, but from a distance the pixel difference might not be seen or noticed by the naked eye.3. The third deciding factor was simply related to the bang for the buck. Check the CNET reviews and their comments on the picture quality. It is really, really good. For those of us who enjoy a good 3D movie, this set has a passive system that rivals any 3D I've seen, even in theaters. I have an LG from a couple years back that had tremendous 3D, but this set is a bit brighter and there is far less image clouding. The price is a BIG deal for most. Even at $2,100 this TV is a great value. If you are getting a smaller version of this set, cool. I'm sure it is just as good. For those going to the 80\", I'm jealous :)Some of my initial observations are in line with many of the points others have already made:* Great picture quality - want to test out just how good this set looks, play Frozen. It will make your jaw drop.* 3D is superb - want to test the 3D? Play Avatar! Breath taking.* Sound is average at best, but I bought the Vizio 5.1 Sound Bar and it is AMAZING! It is only $225, so it is a relatively low-cost, high-performing system that you won't regret pairing up with this TV.*  Smart TV Apps - They ran quickly for me. I have an Almond Router that I am using as a range booster and it switched in and out of the apps quickly and content loaded without any issues.* The Remote - It is nicely laid out and I haven't had the same issues with needing to be in direct sight with the sensor just yet. I am pretty much dead center anyways, but for some I can totally see how this would be problematic.Overall, this is a five star product. For the size and picture quality, you are going to be hard pressed to find something better in the price range. For those that don't like the feeling of buyer\u2019s remorse, this is a safe bet in my opinion. Plus, if you are buying it through Amazon, you get the added insurance of having the best return policy in ecommerce today. I would recommend getting an extended warranty through a third-party provider such as SquareTrade just to ensure you protect your investment for a 3 or 4 year period, but so far so good on my end.

Oh, went to Cosco and compared prices...not enough difference to switch me to Cosco. The SC unit came with 4 pairs of glasses, so I purchased more from Amz.com (and picked up the pink and blue child's glasses as well).Please be aware that prior to investing almost $4k in a television set (at 67 years of age), I REALLY did my homework.  This \"M\" series 80\" 3D unit DELIVERS!!!  And I mean everything they advertise! (this is NOT the earlier problem-plagued \"E\" series). I did no tweaks, and left all settings at factory default.  The 3D is truly impressive, and my daughter and her twins (+ husband of course) have fallen in love with it.  They have the \"Wii\" game thing and have a blast playing its games with the kids.  So, I gave them my 55\" Vizio (they're poor and only have a super small 40\" unit).  Okay, okay, a shameless joke at their expense!I have a Bose 7-1 external sound system.  Hooked up to this TV - my video room ROCKS!  The surround-sound simply can't be beat, so my recommendation is that a buyer go with an external sound system if they can.  Beyond that, I don't have enough descriptive terms to say how much I truly enjoy and like this unit (old eyes, big screen!!).  Beware how it and others like it are displayed on the store's floor.  They will generally tweak the brightness to make the demonstrator unit appear better than its competitors...an old merchandising trick.  So far?  Buy with confidence.PS:  The stand.  It comes with a simple stand (as pictured above in the AD) that once installed, allows the buyer to set the TV on a table top or something similar.  The stand I purchased for my previous Vizio 55\" unit (comes with three black glass shelves) has a max capability of 135lbs.  The \"M\" series 80\" Vizio weighs 114lbs without the simple stand it comes with, so I encountered no weight problems in using it for the larger, heavier, 80\" TV.  Hope this helps.

I've tried different fixes (mirror under sensor, new batteries, got closer to the TV, etc.) - nothing helped. There are sometimes odd things you can do to get it to start working again at times. Example: If the TV isn't responding to the remote right after you turn it on, sometimes adjusting the volume gets TV to respond. Channel surfing can be really painful after a while...B) The smart TV apps I use are unpredictable or sometimes outright unusable. Examples: The Netflix app would not connect to Netflix (went to an error screen with a web page URL in it) for a couple of weeks. (Netflix worked on other hardware.) Then all of a sudden it started working. Then the YouTube app (which had a couple of bugs) suddenly stopped working at all (starts to load then shuts down and returns to the TV). Why? (The apps do update in the background, and I don't see a manual way to force updates - which makes the app problems that much more frustrating to diagnose.) Also, on occasion, various apps will freeze the TV completely and you have to turn off the TV for a few seconds to clear it up.So - If you really want this promising but somewhat frustrating TV:1) Take solace in the pros: The picture quality is really good IMO, especially for the money. There was a review here on Amazon with recommended picture settings, and I used them and got a really good picture. The sound is also ok. I'm picky about audio and was going to get an expensive soundbar, but it does good enough for me. The \"VISIO\" on the lower RH corner of the TV is a little annoying at times, but it looks good overall.2) Do not buy this TV and count on it to take care of all of your Smart App needs (YouTube, Netflix, Vudu, etc.) I STRONGLY recommend getting an external device for those apps. Unlike this TV, my Sony Blu-Ray player (I bought on the same day as this TV), which has the same smart apps, have never once given me a lick of app trouble. Rock solid.)3) Be REALLY patient with the remote, or find a way to avoid using it altogether. If you're a channel surfer, don't have a cable box, and plan on using the in-TV tuner with over-the-air channels with this remote, you should cross this TV off of your list immediately.Addendum:I forgot to mention the 3D. Since I don't watch 3D much I knew that passive 3D glasses was definitely the way to go. This TV is passive, and it came with a box of lightweight 3D glasses (6 or 8 pair?). I'm not a 3D expert, but I've watched a few streamed films (Monsters Inc., Tron Legacy, and a couple of throwaway 3D freebies on Netflix) and on Blu-Ray (Pacific Rim) and the 3D looked pretty good to me (with Pacific Rim on Blu-Ray looking the best - but that may have just been the movie's 3D was done.)", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Digging this tv", "Author": "Jason Hoover", "ReviewID": "R24B2HHYFKZWGQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All the tvs I own are Vizio and I've really never regretted not trying other brands like Sony or Samsung.

I've never owned a smart tv before, so I'm slowly finding my way through the features this tv has to offer.

I already owned a playstation prior to buying this tv and other than playing games and watching bluray movies, I never got to experience playing 3D games or watching 3D movies.

The blacks could be a little deeper like some of the name brand tv's but overall the picture is excellent for what you're buying and I actually prefer it. The M series is a Razor edge lit led tv which makes it very thin and allows localized dimming to create a more realistic and crisp image.Aesthetics - The tv itself is quite spectacular, even when turned off. The front bezel is very small making the tv almost entirely screen with a very very small border.  The stand is also very modern and sturdy so it looks nice on a tv stand or mounted on a wall.Apps - I've personally only used it for Netflix that app alone makes this or any smart tv a good buy since there's a \"Netflix\" button right on the remote for quick access.  The app interface itself is easy to navigate and there looks to be a lot of useful apps available, I however haven't used most of them at all.Quality - I've only had the tv for about a month, but i purchased a square trade protection plan through Amazon as well for 5 years at a good price so even if it breaks I'm not worried about any issues (though i highly doubt there will be any).Overall - This seems to be a very well made product that is aesthetically pleasing both on an off, though I much prefer it on. The picture doesn't produce the deepest of blacks, for that a plasma would beat it hands down, but in direct comparison to other name brand led tvs it stays right with them.  I would highly recommend this tv to anyone who is interested in a new led tv, especially someone who is on a budget as it is also one of the cheapest led tvs for the screen sizes available.Hope this helps!", "Date": "October 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV but not so great audio", "Author": "Jeff H", "ReviewID": "R2BA7VYOEA1U89", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a fun TV to have in a den or bedroom.

Like most of the entertainment centers you will find in furniture stores today my setup was designed to fit a 60\u201d TV. With its ultra-thin frame, I was able to fit a 65\u201d TV in my setup. This unit leaves less than an inch of space all the way around \u2013 a perfect fit! This somewhat irrational decision making inadvertently led me to be purchasing an excellent TV.Picture Quality: The contrast, black levels, sharpness, color accuracy, etc. on this TV are exceptional. Having come from a 3 year old 42\u201d Insigna brand LCD TV this unit vastly superior in more ways than I could imagine. I am noticing things that I didn\u2019t even know were there before. The black level is ultra-black. The only issue I can find is there appears to be a faint blob of light in the middle of the screen when viewing a totally black image. I have not experienced any of the edge bleed issues that others have reported. My edges are jet black. My only real issue with the picture is by having a glossy finish the TV reflects everything. If there is any kind of light source in the room you will see it in the dark areas. Since this is the way the whole industry is heading I cannot blame this TV for these issues. The glossy finish does make everything look sharper and crisper though. My old TV had an anti-glare finish which made watching it easier but at the cost of quality. Also, I don\u2019t think this 3D technology would work with a different finish.3D: The Vizio M Series TV delivers a top-notch 3D experience right to your living room. The image is bright, crisp, and the 3D image looks perfect. Additionally, by utilizing the same circular polarized technology that the Real D movie theaters use you are able to watch 3D movies lying down. Other polarized 3D technology require you to be sitting upright (Try tilting your head next time when watching IMAX 3D, it doesn\u2019t work). For movie theaters this isn\u2019t much of an issue but in the comfort of your own living room you may want to lie down. Finally, this TV comes with 8 pairs of 3D glasses. Many of the competitors only include 4 pairs. If you need more, just keep the ones the movie theater gives you. They work too.Remote: The remote on this TV is total junk. Other reviewers have reported it and my case is no different. However, for people who spending this kind of money on a large 3D TV they likely should be purchasing a nice universal remote to go with it. I use the Logitech Harmony which works well with this TV. I cannot figure out how they managed to make such a poor remote. It doesn\u2019t seem to be issues with the TV receiving the signal, it\u2019s the remote itself. You have to point it very deliberately in the direction of the receiver (bottom left corner of the TV) for it to work. Also, the remove has to be almost perfectly level. I have none of these issues with my Harmony.Sound: Having such a thin frame it would be impossible for this TV to have really high quality audio. Furthermore, the sound actually comes from the back of the TV. My setup includes a surround sound system so I cannot report on the sound quality in great detail. Again, like the remote, if you are spending this kind of money do yourself a favor and get some kind of sound system. The sound quality on modern TV\u2019s is never very good. They expect you to be using something else. Basic soundbars aren\u2019t very expensive and Vizio actually makes a matching soundbar for this TV. Check it out, they don\u2019t cost that much.Overall I find this to be an excellent TV. The remote and sound issues are greatly overshadowed by the picture quality and price. Furthermore, these issues can be solved with the purchase of accessories you should be getting anyway. It always bothers me to see people who spend thousands on a TV and then skimp on remotes and listen to just terrible sound. Having an ultra-thin frame allows for people with a pre-determined space to get a larger TV than what was otherwise allotted. You will not be disappointed with the picture quality or the 3D effects.

This appears to have all the best technology in it.  Its pretty wild its only $378 dollars.2 years ago I could not even dream about getting a LED Smart TV for under $400 dollars, times have definitely changed. This review will act as a guide as well as a review for this VIZIO.One thing that I have found with TV's that its very important to actually look at the TV in person. Now when you look at the TV's, go to a place like Walmart to see them, because many times specialty stores like Best Buy play with the lighting controls on the TV and in the store to skew the image to there advantage. Once you look at the TV simply look and decide which one looks better to youNow first thing when a TV says its LED that is very similar to LCD. The main difference with this type of TV is the way the lighting within the TV is done. LED is back-lit better so that their are no dark spots on the screen. The term SMART TV means this TV has the ability to directly connect to the internet. But what makes a TV a smart TV is its ability to connect all of your devices together. The Smart TV is the train conductor that can push content from your DVD's, game systems, and other devices to the TV.The next step is to look at the features that are offered with the TV. Here are some offered by this VIZIO Smart TV:SMART TV Internet Apps this TV has built-in Wi-Fi which allows you to watch internet content like Netflix, rent movies through the TV.  Pretty much whatever you can do on your computer you can do on this TV.- With LED backlighting the pops with rich color and vivid details.- VIZIO Internet Apps Plus which claims to having hundreds of apps, is pretty impressive.- Razor LED with Smart Dimming for a more vibrant picture with deeper contrast -all in an ultra-thin design.- This LED HDTV is up to 50% more energy efficient than conventional LCD HDTVs to save money.- The slim frame design for this VIZIO lets you maximize your space, allowing you to fit a bigger screen size TV in the same space.- Here is the input/Output layout: 3 HDMI, 1 Component, 1 Composite (shared with component), RF Connector for Internal Tuner, 1 Ethernet, and 1 USB 2.0.Thank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Almost Great, but Sadly Not Quite.", "Author": "JC-EE", "ReviewID": "R34VWRZVWO8JWH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros: acceptable remote control, nice 3D, good number of inputsCons: lower quality, defective out of the boxModel Number: M651D-A2I researched extensively Vizio, Samsung, LG, Sharp.Unnamed club -Costco-, of course, offers price and warranty advantages. So it was in between Vizio and Samsung for the 65\" that would replace my Insignia 37\".The Vizio M651D-A2 naturally was cheaper, so that's what I got.Aside from the common 'substance' for these type of TVs, such as number of inputs, a clear, none-blurry image, and digital audio out, all else can be ignored. EXCEPT, the REMOTE control!That is, they all would give you a decent image, and (per your preference and $$) 3D (passive glasses are cheap and light weight; active require batteries and supposedly are heavier). The 'smart' side is mostly hype, and poorly implemented. Some give you a web browser, some don't. Some play network files (DLNA), others don't. Some play files off a USB flash (but NOT from a HD), others don't. A more solid choice for this would be a 'smart' DVD player, which could easily be replaced/upgraded at a decent cost. Or use a streaming box, such as a Roku.But the REMOTE, there's NO substitute for the REMOTE! This is a critical piece that you'll use day in and day out to INTERACT with your new PRICEY TV, 'smart' or otherwise. I'm flabbergasted at HOW POOR manufacturers solutions are. They completely disregarded the most basic component, while getting carried away in the hype by so many bells and whistles that NOT all users may want/need. The REMOTE is COMMON to ALL users, regardless.My old Insignia came with an AWESOME remote. With a good array of buttons to quickly access the most basic and COMMON functions. A button to cycle inputs. A button to turn CC on/off (and even an auto CC on mute). A button to change Screen size/ratio. A button to cycle audio modes. A button to listen to SAP. A button to cycle to pre-selected favorites. Page up/down button (when you have dozens of channels to scroll through, up/down arrows alone won't do). A GUIDE/Info button. A button to cycle Viewing Mode (sports, movie, etc). Etc. Other functions/adjustments were, naturally, accessed using the MENU. But these are things one does one time, or once in a while, so that's where they belong (such as scanning for new channels, network setup, etc).But guess what?? The new 'DUMB' TVs bury the MOST basic functions inside MENUES! So to change almost ANYTHING (such as CC), you have to dig through, with multiple presses just to turn it on. Then repeat again the whole thing to turn it off! This will drive you crazy in no time.For the Samsungs I've read nightmarish reviews about this. The Vizio came with a decent remote with some accessible options. But most notably it was missing CC and SAP, plus page up/down. Image quality, including 3D were great.However, I had issues with the network - wired, as the TV is next to my router. DHCP picked up an address right away. But in this mode you cannot edit any field and since the DNS servers were not correct, the TV could not connect to internet. So I setup it up as Static. Not a problem. (I'm a Net Engineer and have several devices setup as such without issues). Now the TV would connect fine. Weather, YouTube, etc. worked fine. That is, until I powered off the TV. Next time it couldNOT connect. Zip. So I had to cycle through DHCP, wait, Static, enter all info manually again to get connected. Only to lose it all on the next power cycle! Hours of debug, including a factory reset did not fix it (I tested wi-fi, just for kicks, but as expected, it did the same thing).The other issue was that YouTube pairing did not work (possibly related to the above). If you're not familiar with it, you SEARCH for content on your phone/ipad -- this is a million times better than fumbling with the little on-screen array where you select a character and click it. The TV and ipad being on the same network, YouTube gives you a code to 'pair'. Then the TV prompts you for the code and presto. Now your ipad's YouTube shows an icon to 'play content on TV'. And just like that you're watching on the TV. Now, this is NOT streaming from ipad to TV. Rather the video's address is sent to the TV, where the YouTube's app loads it directly from the net. In my case, the video would play for a few seconds and stop (to buffer, presumably) and would resume already skipped. Over and over. Doing the same search directly on the TV, the video played flawlessly.The next issue I had was with the audio. I have a Toslink cable connecting the TV-out to my LG home theater's SPDF-in. With the old Insignia it worked perfectly. I could listen through the LG to any source (DVR, XBOX, DVD). With the Vizio I had multiple audio drops spaced out every 5-10 minutes. Very annoying as you're constantly missing dialog.An hour on the phone with Vizio tech support determined the Net module was bad (the audio issue had not come up then). So either replace it at no charge, or return the TV to Unnamed club -Costco-. A no-brainer. This is going back.Noticeably too, and I told this to Unnamed club -Costco-'s CS rep, the TV came without a single piece of paper! No manual, no quick-setup, no warranty card, no Costo extended warranty. Nothing! And with the malfunctions I experienced it almost looked as if I had been shipped a refurbished set. -- He was appalled at the non-conformance to products sold/shipped by Unnamed club -Costco- and noted someone would definitely follow up with Vizio.The last item to note is that the screen is indeed VERY reflective. It didn't affect me much, as I purposely placed the TV in a corner, facing away from all windows. Even so, just a small stripe of sunlight hitting the floor (from the little gap between the blinds and the window frame) would be highly reflected, interfering with the image.FWY, if you're interested, the Sharp LC-70LE757 comes with a VERY nice remote. We'll see how that works out once I get it delivered.\"Ah yes, the Remote is quite finicky. But the problem is mainly the IR sensor on the TV. It is weak/small, located right on the spot where you see the power light. Unless you are pointing directly at it, as in a perfect straight line, you won't get a good response.***** JAN 2014 update *****I got the Sharp LC-70LE757 70-inch Aquos Quattron as a best candidate replacement (http://www.amazon.com/Sharp-LC-70LE757-70-inch-Aquos-Quattron/dp/B00BJFS6M4).The TV had a nice finish, and not reflection issues to speak of. However, the colors were way off. I mean, like really bad -- out of the box most people's faces looked green. I spent hours with the Disney WOW and some other more expensive tools. Nothing would tweak this to something passable. So I had to ship it back.Then I read someone's short comment about Vizio using a different screen surface on their 70\" version -- Oh my!This is what I got and it is amazing! Everything looks great right out of the box. Only once I had to make a minor adjustment for brightness, and just for this one show. A definite winner.http://www.amazon.com/VIZIO-M701d-A3R-70-Inch-1080p-240Hz/dp/B00CHKPYM0(the only thing I miss from the Sharp is the remote - far superior than the Vizio's).", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV!", "Author": "Keith Wyatt", "ReviewID": "R2OAN7J6SMKLMC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had the TV for a little over a month now and I am very happy with it.

Switching off, for example, is rarely achieved with a single push of the button. And there are no buttons on the TV itself.......- Also, the design of the remote control is not great - lots of small black on black buttons, casing has sharpish edges. In need of an Apple-type designer make over.- Nexflix app works well and it is very convenient to have the dedicated Netflix button on the remote- the Amazon app on this TV is terrible - no watch list function, app launches slowly and only on the left hand third of the screen (so difficult to see); You have basically to do all your browsing and movie selection on line and then launch the app to play what you have chosen. There are multiple complaints about the poor app design, which Vizio blames on Amazon (see multiple messages on this topic on Amazon). So bad I am going back to my Roku to use my Amazon account on this TV- the other apps largely seem to be junk and are slow slow slow to load (or never do, like YouTube) - feels like using an old Windows XP machine years ago.

It is quite amazing how much TVs have improved in the last 4 years.  The sound is much better, the picture is brighter and has better details.The Vizio remote runs my Samsung Blu-ray player through the HDMI connection.  My old Samsung TV was also connected via HDMI to the player, but they never got along.The audio and video settings can be customized separately for each input which is very nice.Our only complaints are minor:-- You see banding during the credits of movies when the LEDs turn on and off if there is a solid black background.  This only happens during the credits so who cares.-- There's no headphone jack, which is a disappointment.  I used headphones quite often with the old Samsung because the sound was so poor.  Not a problem with the Vizio, so I haven't missed the headphone jack, and I can connect to my stereo if need be.-- You are totally reliant on the remote control to run this set.  I don't know if that will turn out to be a problem.  The only button on the back of the screen changes input source and if held down works as a power switch.-- The remote could be a little better ergonomically.  It is not obvious by feel which end points to the set, so it is easy to pick it up and use it backwards.  You have to point the remote directly at the bottom left corner of the screen or it doesn't respond.-- Set up was not the easiest, mostly because there are many times you have to type things (passwords, e-mail addresses, etc.) and there are several different screens for entering text that don't all work the same way.

She then changed the answer to call in a few hours.I asked again, what will change in a few hours if nothing changed in the last 24 hours and voila, she magically found my receipt.Seriously, I think this worker just wanted to go to lunch.Update 1 - Apparently the rep was such in a rush that my name was just written as gibberish that the next rep was confused.Update 2 - They will interrogate to make sure you are an actual Vizio customer rather than treating like you are a valued customer-----Vizio Tech Support - 4/5The guy that came to the door to fix the power problem was great.He did not speak english, but his skill level was good.

At first it worked flawlessly.  The picture was excellent and all worked well. Within two days, the remote would not communicate with the TV.  For example, it was intermittently unable to control the volume.  A few minutes later it would work again, only to work intermittently. I called service and they told me that it was the remote.  I told them that I also had a Harmony remote, which was also working in the same manner--intermittently.  The service department told me to reset the remote.  I did but the problems persisted.  They told me that they would send me another remote.  I said fine but I didn't think that it was the remote.Two days later, the TV would freeze up after I adjusted the volume and the volume bar would stay on the screen for several minutes before disappearing.  It is only supposed to be on-screen for a few seconds.  Other commands on the TV also froze up.  I called service again and was told that the problem was a software issue.  I then completely reset the TV--nothing changed.  I was told that Vizio would send a software update directly to my tv wirelessly within 48 hours.  This did not occur.  I called Vizio service for a third time.  This time I was told that no software update would be sent because none existed.  I found this to be rather irritating since the previous representative put me on hold to confer with their engineering department.The representative then told me that I had a defective tv and offered to send another set.  I declined and returned the set and bought a Sony 40-450a.  I hooked it up easily and it works flawlessly.  The picture is also excellent.  It is important to note that I had hooked up to both sets directly to my Directv receiver and I had used this same reciever with another HDTV without any problem.This was actually the third Vizio that I had purchased. Earlier this year, I had two Vizio 70 inch TV's, both which had odd issues, including, without limitation, making a loud banging noise when I turned them off. They also had remote control issues--sometimes working, sometimes not.  I returned these and bought a 70 inch Sony, which also works flawlessly.  I purchased the Vizio 40 inch because it was an \"M\" model, and not the earlier \"A\" series.  I figured that the bugs had been worked out.  FYI, I was told that there was a problem with the 70 inch and its interface with the hdmi port from Directv.I have numerous HDTV's throughout my home.  I have two Samsungs, two Sony's, a Panasonic and an LG, among others.  I have had no similar problems with any of them.  One had a picture issue two years after I bought it and was repaired under warranty.I don't know if I am just unlucky or if there are others that have had odd issues with these sets.  I leave that to you. However, I have no intention of purchasing any other Vizio products at this time.  I also was rather irritated that I received different instructions from the Vizio reps.  Why would they tell me that it was a software issue and that an update would be sent directly to my tv if this wasn't going to occur?  I don't know.  I admit that the picture quality of all three sets were excellent.  The entire experience was disappointing to me.  From these posts, it appears that this 40 inch set has been very well received.  I wonder if anyone else had problems and will post something if they did.I really liked the picture and features of this set but have little confidence.  Just my two cents.

When doing the initial setup, I was asked to enter my name, email, and other information for registration. Well, there was nowhere on the remote with letters and there was nothing in the quick start guide on how to get to letters.  So, I called in and they said they have gotten a lot calls for this and hope to add the very simple direction of simply pressing the ok button to bring up the letters so you can type your information with the remote.  Well, another note, the button doesn't say  ok.  It's the middle button on the pad with the arrows on top.  This problem was not present in any other area, only the initial setup registration.Some people have commented about the remote being slow or not working unless you point it in certain areas.  I thought this at first too. But, you just have to push the buttons a little harder than you'd expect and it responds instantly. I do like that it is backlit.  It's not a universal remote, so that was a bit of a drawback.  But, otherwise.  The remote is good.As for the TV, I LOVE it! I have it set on the vivid picture mode, but I did tone down the red settings on the cool temperature.  Everyone looked like they'd been tanning too long.  The available apps are good.  I use Hulu Plus, VUDU, Netflix, and Pandora mostly.  Pandora wasn't preinstalled, but installation is easy.  It's also easy to uninstall apps you don't want to make room for those you do.  I also LOVE the way facebook and smaller apps like the yahoo weather work.  You can bring it up just on the side of the tv so you can still watch your content and have the extra content on the side.  Also, the main apps (Netflix, Pandora, etc...) are full screen and look very nice while you are selecting content.The TV looks great, aside from the snafu with registration, the setup was easy.  It quickly found my network and I've had no problems streaming anything.I don't have cable and I use a digital antena.  The tv quickly found available channels and they look great.I love the tv and the price is great.  There are more expensive models with more features,but if you like technology (like I do) and want something that gets the job done, looks nice, and is reasonably priced....this is the tv for you!***Update*** I still love the tv.  I accidentally found a cool little extra.  I have my Sony blu ray player hooked up to the tv.  I haven't used it often since I got the new tv with internet apps.  The other day, I turned on the blu ray and the tv turned on and set itself to the right input for the blu ray player automatically.  I also later discovered that it will automatically tune to the right input if the tv is on as well.  When the blu ray was playing, I needed to pause it and grabbed my tv remote out of habit.  I hit the pause button and it worked! I can pause, play, rewind, fast forward, and go forward or back a chapter too.  I can also control the menu with the up, down, over, and ok buttons.  This remote is not a universal remote.  I even called Vizio shortly after getting the tv to see what universal remotes they had or recommend.  I never programmed the remote, there is not way to do so.  So, my assumption is that if the device is attached to the TV, the TV remote will operate basic functions of the device.  The only thing it won't do is let me pull up the disc menu.  Hitting menu on the TV remote only brings up the TV menu.  I never saw this information in the product info and the Vizio rep didn't mention this function when I called to inquire about a universal remote to control both my tv and my blu ray.

It was a $2000 3D plasma tv.  It was AMAZING.  Then my kid threw something at it and broke it a year later.  I've been reluctant to buy a new tv for 2 reasons; 1) I didn't want something that wouldn't look as good as that tv and 2) I didn't want it to get broken again.  So I bought a POS DLP for $100 and let them have that.last week, I got tired of looking at that crappy tv and finally decided it was time to get a new one. After doing months and months of research, it seemed that the only way I was going to get a tv with the same PQ as my old plasma was to buy the new Samsung plasma the F8500 series, which are around $3K. That wasn't happening.My friend got this tv and it was great, I loved the black levels, and even though its edge lit with some backlighting, it still performed well, and had great reviews. It was passive 3D which was another plus.  The only thing it didn't have that I love, was 240hz or even 120hz for that matter. (The samsung I had was great because it had its own motion processing that made it look like it was a 120hz tv, and so being a plasma with awesome PQ, AND Motion Processing, I was in heaven).  But not knowing that my friend had the tv set to game mode which automatically turns the motion processing off, I went ahead and got the tv anyway...Needless to say, I was BLOWN AWAY.  The PQ on this thing is incredible!  My wife and kids all watched Despicable me, and the Amazing Spiderman in 3D and it was better (in my opinion) than 3D at the theater.  Comparing it to my older 3D plasma which used active 3D, the PQ does not degrade what-so-ever when it goes into 3D mode, AND the 240hz still runs in 3D!!! I know a lot of you don't like the motion processing, but it looks AMAZING with CGI based movies. Anyway, there is ZERO crosstalk when viewing movies in 3D.  Usually you would see lots of crosstalk on an active system during dark scenes or scenes where there are lots of light and dark shapes with high contrast, which makes the picture at that point,  unenjoyable.  But I say again, ZERO crosstalk on this tv.I give credit where its due, and vizio has outdone themselves with this tv.  I never thought that I'd be replacing my samsung, with a sub $1k Vizio!  I'm glad I did. I have no regrets.  Well ok, I have ONE small complaint.  The only thing that the vizio can't do that the samsung could do, was play MKVs straight from a hard drive.  But now a days you can grab a roku and that won't be a problem.  So all in all I give it 5 Stars.  Of Course I'm not going to complain about sound because thats not what these tvs are made for.  I'll be looking to get a Sonos sound bar and a Sub to complete my set up later.If you're on the fence, go for it, try it out. If for some reason unknown to the universe that you don't like this tv, first have someone slap you as hard as they can, when you wake up, look at the tv again, and ONLY THEN if you still don't like it, return it.

After setting it up, I noticed the lower left corner of the screen would randomly dim for a split-second every couple of minutes, as though the back-lighting in that corner was periodically cutting out. I took it back to Best Buy & exchanged it for another of the same make. The new TV had the very same screen dimming problem, so I assumed the cause lied outside the TV. I tried feeding the TV different inputs using different cables, hoping to isolate the cause, but the flickering continued. I noticed that it even happened when the TV was displaying its on-screen user manual, which ruled out external inputs as the cause. Thinking the power outlet might be the problem, I moved it to another circuit, and even plugged it into a UPS which completely isolated it from my house's AC mains. It still flickered.By now, I was outside my return period, so I called Vizio for a replacement. After explaining the problem to the first tech, (and running through several perfunctory & pointless troubleshooting steps) he arranged for a replacement. The next afternoon, I received a phone call from some manager who told me she had canceled the replacement order. Evidently, Vizio required photographic or video proof that the problem was happening as described--something the tech I first talked to failed to mention. Since trying to photograph a random, split-second flicker isn't particularly easy, I had to shoot a video of the screen & edit it down to try to highlight the issue. After several frustrating attempts to post the video to Vizio's support site, I received a phone call saying they couldn't see the problem I described. I had to walk them through it, pointing out the exact moment when the camera caught the flicker, and they finally authorized a replacement.It took about 11 days for the replacement to arrive at my house. Unfortunately, the replacement was a refurb, or \"remanufactured\" TV, as they put it. True to form, after being left on for a few minutes, this third TV started flickering in the lower-left corner too, though it would get randomly brighter instead of darker. Another call to Vizio support ensued, more time was wasted running through the same fruitless troubleshooting steps, and capturing the problem on video. Fortunately, this TV's problem showed up on the video a little better, so Vizio agreed to ship a brand-new TV as a replacement. Nine days later, it has arrived, and I'm keeping an eye on it as I type this. To its credit, I haven't observed any flickering or other problems, beyond a slight stink of hot plastic.

Tried every possible setting to find my happy place for picture quality.I really tried to keep it.Before I go further I can not deny that the 3d on this set is awesome. Better 3d than the Samsung that replaced it has.I replaced the Vizio with the Samsung UN55F6400A active 3d.Issue #1 If you use a Home Theater surround system the TV doesn't & plain won't ever support HDMI pass through. Means in order to use TV your surround receiver has to be on. If you want to use the TV speakers you have to manually set it every time. This causes all kinds of wear & tear on the surround receiver.Its 2013/2014 all TVs this size should support HDMI pass through.2nd issue is light bleed through. When the TV turns on all 4 corners bleed light very ,very badly. Movies that are letterbox suffer greatly because the bleed through is in your face as you watch letter boxed movies. And a lot of movies are letterboxed.3rd Brightness. This televisions brightness is not very pleasing. In settings there's an option for backlight. After 50\u2105 it doesn't get any brighter. No change from 50% & up.4th The 2d picture quality doesn't fare well either. No matter how I calibrated the picture it always had this film of fog over it. No it isn't the screen. The screen is glossy.When watching Blurays the quality improved somewhat. But it would get a smeared look on faces that had shadows casted on. I expect this during fast scenes but it actually did this during people talking. Example World War Z Bluray when in the car talking at beginning Brad and wife the light shadows that cast on their faces would get this smear look completely ruining the picture quality. And it wasn't just WWZ it happened consistently on other bluray movies. Tried turning off 24hz thought this could be the cause of the smeared look. But nope that wasn't it at all.The Smart TV features aren't that bad at all. Only issue I had is it doesn't offer many apps.3d wise this TV was awesome during 3d playback on Bluray it looked great and had great POP. Only time this TV impressed me was during 3d blurays. No smear effects were present and almost 0 cross talk that I could see. Smart app Netflix 3d is another story. No matter what movie in 3d I tried it looked sub par and lots of jagged edges.It also lacked being able to make regular 2d to 3d conversion like the LG,Samsung's and Sony do. While forced 3d doesn't look anything like a filmed in 3d movie.its nice to at least have that option. And honestly the only way to watch the Vizio is in 3d. The 2d picture doesn't fly.While the hardware meaning the look of it is impressive the thin slim bezzel that makes the TV look like all screen.

Having considered option from a vacation to audiophile quality headphones (and necessary accessories  such as an amp or DAC), my fiance and I settled on upgrading our TV so we could have a new one for the living room and the old one for our bedroom.The model we were upgrading from was a 32\" Vizio smart and 3D television, so we were familiar with Vizio and felt they deserved their reputation of offering features usually found on high end devices at wallet-friendly prices. We read many reviews and poured over the specs and this was the only TV of this size that fit our budget while also offering smart features and 3D. We also read in several reviews that the picture quality rivaled that of some models from Samsung and Sony that were in a higher price category. We weren't too concerned about the smart features as we have several gaming consoles that cover the apps we deem necessary but it was important that the TV use passive 3D as not only have we concluded that passive offers a superior 3D experience, but it also allowed us to utilize our large stash of 3D glasses that we have accumulated from various theaters rather than using expensive, bulky, battery powered, proprietary glasses that active 3D technology utilizes.We bought the 55\" model, the Vizio M551D-a2, which is actually a slightly different model than whats on Amazon, the difference being that the model ending in A2 comes with 4 pairs of passive 3D glasses while the one ending in A2R comes with 8 pairs of glasses. No big deal to us though due to our aforementioned glasses stash.We came back from Wal-mart (where we bought it) and took it out of the box. This TV looks beautiful. A silver metal frame along the outside with a very tiny bezel invoked a minimalist design. The Vizio logo was situated in the bottom right corner and looked like a tab from an internet browser. I very much liked that design. We hooked it up to the stand, which was made of the silver metal and looked at home with the rest of the TV's design, neither appearing cheap nor flimsy like so many TV stands out there. In fact, head on it looks like the TV is hovering over the base of the stand when it is in place.We put on some Blu-rays using our PS3 to test out the picture quality. Out of the box the calibrated and calibrated dark picture settings look pretty good, providing a better picture than any we have ever owned. But we knew that theses preset settings are not the best they could be, so using a calibration blu-ray we set the picture and it made a very noticeable difference. The colors are vibrant without being overwhelming and the black levels are excellent for an LED television without crushing shadow details. Our big example of this was watching a movie called \"Knights of Badassdom\" which features a large part of the movie taking place at night. Blacks where inky but you could distinguish the different dark colors in the night scenes.One thing that worried us about picture quality was just how focused the picture looked, seeing as it was a 55\" 1080p screen and we sit less than 6' away from the screen. Well I am happy to say that the screen resolution with 1080p source material looks crystal clear and properly sharp without any hint of being able to see individual pixels. So with this test, I believe it is safe to say that I don't see the need to upgrade to a 4k television any time soon.Using our PS3 we watched some of our 3D blu-rays including The Hobbit: An unexpected journey and The Avengers. All I can say is WOW! I felt that watching those movies on this TV was a more immersive and mesmerizing experience than watching them in theaters. The 3D was of excellent quality, ghosting and cross-talk free and we personally could not see any pixelation or jagged edges caused by the passive technology (not that it isn't there, but unless you are a hardcore videophile you probably will never notice it). While my other 3D TV added depth to the picture, the 3D on this TV really adds a \"pop\" effect.We tested out the apps, even if as mentioned before we didn't need them on the TV, and the ones we have tested seem to work fine, mainly Netflix, YouTube and Vudu. The television communicates with our router wirelessly with no problem and the interface for these apps are rather slick and streamlined.As for the sound, we can't really attest for the built in speakers as we normally use wireless headphones (as we live in an apartment with thin walls). We turned the volume on the TV up once and it was adequate for our small living room though it may cause issue in a large room. But, as with many speakers that are built in to modern TV's, you can get a much better experience from using hooking up external speakers/ a soundbar/headphones, so this really isn't that big an issue.A note on the remote. though my fiance disagrees, I personally love this remote. The buttons are layed out well and it is backlit which is an awesome feature for when you are watching TV in the dark. We haven't received the update for the remote to function for WiFi but seeing as we read that the IR sensor is in the bottom left (your left while facing the TV) corner of the screen we are just sure to aim it in that general direction when pressing buttons and it registers our pushes every time. The only thing in my opinion that would make this remote better is if it had a QWERTY keyboard on the back like the remote for my other TV has, but I won't dock points for not having that.So with all that being said, all in all my fiance and I are both extremely satisfied with this television. It meets all our needs in terms of features while providing excellent picture quality at a very agreeable price. If anything happens to it (and I did buy a warranty just in case) I will be sure to update the review, but for now I award this product with the highest rating of 5 stars!", "Date": "March 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "works great right out of the box", "Author": "William N.

My wife bought a 42\" Samsung smart tv about two months ago and the apps were great, including a web browser, Netflix, Amazon instant video and cloud player. I also found Daily Burn, which has become my daily workout companion. I was looking at a Samsung set for me when the salesperson pointed out the razorLED picture on this Vizio set. It DID seem like a better picture, so I postponed my decision. When I returned to the store, the Vizio was on sale ($50 reduction) so that settled it! After all, the box had logos for all kinds of apps including Netflix. I figured all smart tvs had similar apps.Well, setup was quite easy. I used a wired Ethernet for best streaming speed and most of the apps seemed to work except for Netflix. I then found that most apps available for the Vizio were Yahoo-based instead of Google-based, and my news apps were what seemed like dozens of variations on Fox News. Alll in all I was missing the apps I knew and loved. No Daily Burn! No web browser. And try as I may, I couldn't get the Netflix app to work. Per suggestions on the web I tried deleting the app and re-installing it, then tried resetting to factory defaults and re-installing everything (with the help of Vizio tech support). Finally tech support said it was obviously a Netflix problem. So I called Netflix. Nice support person worked through the same stuff, eventually concluding that it was obviously Vizio's problem. I complained bitterly about the finger-pointing game and she gave me several reasons why it HAD to be Vizio's problem and that was the end of that!At this point it was MY problem. Both tech supports had been very responsive (no long hold times) and I learned a lot about the tv with the Vizio support guy. At this point all apps except Netflix worked great, even though I wasn't able to get apps I'd come to enjoy. Nothing could be done about that.So I gave up on Vizio smart features. I really like the ease of access to setup features on the tv. Downloading and updating firmware seemed quicker than the Samsung. Since I wasn't happy with the app selection, I just bought a Roku 3 with free Prime shipping. I have all my favorite apps again, including Netflix and Daily Burn. And there are MANY more apps just waiting to be tried.My summary: the Vizio smart tv (M471i-A2) has a great picture, easy setup, great tech support ... But the apps simply don't get it. Just buy a Roku at the same time and save yourself a lot of frustration.

Did that, nothing. Tell me to put new batteries in. Viola, it works! as the week progresses I find a few more issues. The remote in IR mode HAS to be pointed directly at the lower-left of screen. not the middle, no the right, but the LOWER LEFT to work. You can put the remote in WiFi mode, but if it's like mine, it will forget how to work after 5 minutes, so you have to reset it. Netflix and all that stream awesomely. 3D is cool, but all the 3D movies on Netflix are crap unless your 5 years old. There is a slight lag. No sniping N00bs on C.O.D buddy, they saw you a half-second ago. Even with \"Smooth Motion\" turned off it still looks like I'm dragging my mouse courser with a string. Even Cable is slightly off-sync. And the Lip-Sync only makes the TV lag more. The menu is very... E-series-ish. Browsing my PC media files freezes the TV every time. The Universal portion of the remote looked cool, but doesnt work. You have to enter the model number of, lets say, my Yamaha Receiver. Now if you have a few Yammy's, you should know that they all pretty much use the same remote code for volume control. Doesn't work with the Vizio remote.

A friend has this very same tv and recommended it whole heartedly. We decided to purchase this and replace our Samsung 50\" plasma in the living room.My wife was reluctant to spend this much money on a tv, since we aleady have 3 larger plasmas throughout the house, but I insisted that a 70\" would look amazing.Amazon shipping got the tv to us in 4 days, which was way better than the original company we purchased it through (sam$club). After unpacking the tv and mounting it above the fireplace, we were ready to turn this puppy on and see how it looked. We had to put the tv to the test by playing the absolute best 3D movie out there... The Avengers in 3D.We sat back and were amazed at how awesome the picture is on this beast. So many times throughout the movie, both my wife and I just said \"...wow\" at various points throughout the movie. It was amazing enough for her to say she was happy that we spent the money we did on this thing. Since then, we've had quite a few families come visit our house and the tv is the first thing they notice and want to see in action. Just about everyone leaves the house saying they're going to try to get one now.I was skeptical of Vizio, as I've never purchased this brand before, but they totally delivered on this product. I almost regret not going for broke and purchasing the 80\", but at double the cost, I really couldnt justify that price.I totally recommend this for anyone looking at spending a couple grand on a VERY quality tv for their household. The 3D is absolutely amazing, way better than any theatre experience I've had.The issue of the remote is not a big deal: just point it at the lower left hand corner and everything is great./////THE ONE ISSUE: I still can't, for the life of me, understand why they would advertise Amazon Video on the box of this tv, and even put an actual button at the top of the remote controller specifically for Amazon Video, knowing that the application does not work. I thought it was a problem with just my tv, but after contacting Vizio and Amazon, it's a known issue that all 2013 and 2014 Vizio TVs are incapable of having the Amazon Video app work due to some ClosedCaption requirement that has yet to be resolved in over a year and a half. ridiculous/////Either way, we ended up using Amazon Video through our 3D blu-ray player, so it's not a big deal.

I bought my Vizio via Costco. Sorry Amazon, but it truly was a spur of the moment thing, I'm not giving up on Amazon, still love the site.Anyway, I noticed a strong electrical smell coming from my unit. Then I found the right side, more toward the top right corner, to be very hot.  I did some research and found this has been noted by others.Just got off with the chat with Vizio.  They were very helpful and quick to ID the culprit.  Turns out, the thin TVs, including this one, have the power unit inside the right side of the TV. Yet, because the TV is so thin, there is no internal fan; thus why it's hot.  As for the smell, it is apparently the lacquer used to coat the parts for shipping. The lacquer heats up and creates the odor.In my case, it smells more electrical, not paint/lacquer smell.  It's enough to force me to open the windows as it will give me a headache if I don't.  The agent has forwarded my inquiry to their Safety Team since I'm stating it's more an electrical smell.With Costco, the benefit is they will take it back if there are issues, as I'm sure Amazon would do.So, if you experience the hot screen and odor, at least you'll understand why.I've had mine for 30 days now and the color, picture and responsiveness of the TV has been great, so no issues on that front.Hope this helps", "Date": "February 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Completely satisfied", "Author": "M. Friedman", "ReviewID": "RSQ2MBQJCQJVN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We got this to replace an ageing 25\" CRT TV. That should explain some of the context. Virtually any flat panel TV picture is superior to what we had, so if I rave about the picture quality of this TV, please keep that in mind. Having said that, after several weeks of research and shopping, I found it difficult to decide whose picture -- Samsung, Sony, etc. -- was objectively \"better,\" though each brand's implementation seemed to have slightly different baseline properties of brightness, contrast, saturation, etc. Most of these are adjustable in ANY TV's properties control, however, and so many other variables -- room lighting, angle, distance -- enter into picture quality that comparing models side-by-side at an electronics store is pretty pointless.What I can say is that, in our small living room, with either overhead or indirect (lamp) incandescent lighting, at a distance of ten feet, and viewed directly, the picture quality is outstanding (streamed, DVD and BluRay content). There is a little glare from a window on the screen surface (which is glossy) during the day, but it's nothing that closing  the curtains can't fix.The software controls and features are excellent. The TV is easily set up and, on the one occasion that I needed to speak to tech support (setting up the channel scan), I found the technician polite, helpful, and informative. The implementation of Netflix, Hulu Plus and Amazon streaming video (among others) is excellent. If I have a complaint, however, it is that  the interface fr Amazon video doesn't seem to let me access my Watchlist, and I must search titles directly, though there is not difficulty finding titles that I have purchased or rented.I will say that the sound quality is excellent. It tends very slightly to the treble, but not too much. It is stereo sound, of course.

I paid just under $1,000 for mine at Costco.  The large screen, 3D, and Smart TV Apps make it a good value.  It is very slim and has a decent picture.  The default settings are terrible, requiring some tweaking to get the color/brightness right.  I calibrated the brightness/contrast using a Blu-Ray disc and was disappointed that the TV does not have a gamma setting.  It seems to seriously lack quality in dark scenes, and after trying numerous settings combinations was unable to real dial it in such that it looked great across most scenes of different shows.  Some scenes where objects move in from the corners make the edge lit shadowing  obvious and I find this annoying.  What I find most annoying about the TV are the skin tones in dark scenes, which are over saturated with red.  By turning down the color setting to de-saturate, I was able to make this look better, but it adversely affected the lighter scenes, washing them out and removing the pop.  Additionally, the smooth motion is nifty but isn't appealing to most people unless you want all of your shows to look like soap operas.  Luckily that setting can be turned off.EDIT:I was about to return the TV and decided to compare it side by side to my previous TV, also a Vizio, but an older 32\" model.  What was most interesting here is the brightness factor.  The newer TV was at a much higher brightness compared to the old one.  I proceeded to adjust settings on the new TV to match the old TV as closely as possible so that I could compare it using more or less the same darkness/saturation I had been watching over the previous few years on the smaller TV.  Once I did this, all of my worries and concerns about this TV went away and I have no intention of taking it back.  One thing to note when upgrading from a smaller screen to one of these very large screens is that annoyances with the picture seem much more amplified because the size is so large (little things become big things).  So in my case, the main problem was too much brightness and too much sharpness.  I decreased the brightness and sharpenss settings and slightly adjusted the temperature to decrease red and it was good to go.In summary, this TV is awesome, especially considering the cost.

Like others have mentioned, there IS a little edge-light bleed in the corners, but not nearly as bad as others have claimed.  I popped in Star Trek First Contact blu-ray since it has a lot of dark scenes and fast moving spots as well.  The edge bleed was completely unnoticeable to me during the dark scenes, and the fast moving scenes were very natural with no blurring or juddering that I could see.The TV settings out of the box are typically bad, but you can do a search (or check other Amazon reviews!) for good settings to use instead.

The glare is horrible for watching dark movies and tv shows during the day, which I can tell you is a lot of shows. Seeing yourself in the background during a normal show is just odd and not desired. It does not glare on football with the grass being green.

Vivid colors. Easy set up. Good sound. Extremely thin design. Found that adjusting the color and hue to my own preference gave a superior picture than the out of the box settings.Cons: Blacks are not prefect- on completely black screen with white titles, get a good deal of edge flare and around white titles on black get a white shadow around. However, this is a common flaw I read about and it is not the worst thing in the world given the great picture. The smoothing effect in the picture setting can sometimes look artificial, for example , watching a movie in that mode can make the people look like they were filmed on a soap opera set, that video look rather than film look. Fortunately, you can shut it off if it is bothersome. Also, the auto sound leveling  can sometimes elevate background sounds to prominence creating a very annoying effect. Again, easily remedied by turning off the effect.Bought the 3-D, \"M\" Series , not because I watch many 3-D movies , but because of the better boards they put in these models.

I use this as a computer monitor, it is good for that purpose.The firmware will auto update when the TV is off.  Of course you have to be connected to the internet for that.  Speaking of internet, one nitpick is that the TV only works on the 2.4 ghz wireless band.  Since that band is used for cordless phones and microwaves, you may or may not get a reliable signal.  It would have been much better if it had the option to use the 5 ghz band like the recent iPads.  In my case I had lots of issues with buffering on amazon prime and youtube with wifi, switched over to ethernet.  It is always safer to go with wired when streaming hd video.Some folks complained about the remote.  I got my TV refurb and it came with a different remote that worked great.Other nitpicks?  Well, I would have liked a few more buttons on the TV in case I lose the remote.  It only has a power button on the back.  Would have been nice to have volume and channel buttons, perhaps a menu and input button.One last thing.  This is a good choice for amazon prime members rather than streaming movies to your pc.  Reason being that prime movies stream in sd to a pc, but you can get them in hd to certain tv's and blu-ray players.  You can stream hd tv shows to a pc, but not movies for some reason.  I mostly watch movies so I appreciated the hd movies I can now view through amazon prime.Good TV, recommended.EDIT 11/12/2013I am lowering my rating by one star to 4/5 due to the internet connection being erratic, even using ethernet.  Sometimes I can get a solid connection, other times I get lots of buffering and wait times while videos load on amazon instant video and youtube.

This is the third Vizio TV I have owned and I'm a big fan.  The second Vizio I owned was a 55'' comparable model to this TV (3d, online apps, etc..).  One day I I tried to access the online apps (Amazon, Netflix) via my wi-fi connection and movies were streaming extremely slow or not at all.  I checked my internet speed, which was fine, and came to the conclusion it was probably the TV.  I spoke with a tech guy at Vizio and we banged out all the troubleshooting with no luck.  A day later I get a call from Vizio saying that they will be issuing me a full refund of the purchase price as well as pay for shipping of the flawed TV.  I was shocked that a company in this day and age was actually holding itself accountable and issuing me a check, not a credit with the company.  Anyways, with that check I was able to purchase this 60\" Vizio, for around the same price I paid for the 55\".  The TV is great, passive 3d is pretty awesome (best to watch at night), and the access to wireless online content is plentiful.  The only knock I have on this TV is that they dropped the QWERTY keyboard from the remote which they had on previous models.  It just takes a bit longer to search for stuff online, such as YouTube.

This TV is not for everyone or every use. I bought this unit to replace a 65\" primarily for movie watching experience and sports. I had been waiting to purchase the LG 84\", but once I discovered this set, read reviews, and looked at a smaller version in a local store I took a leap of faith. I do believe the LG is undoubtedly the gold standard; but how long would I have to wait just to even pay less than 10K for it, when I could get this one NOW for less than 1/3 of what I HOPED to pay for the LG. My goals were to move up to a minimum of a 75\" screen and to keep the 3D as passive. There are not too many offering such a beast.Out of the box - you too will likely want to return it. Its out of box settings are horrific. Once I made numerous adjustments, the picture is actually quite good. I do believe that I will have it professionally calibrated, and I have never done so before. Since the larger sets like these are big magnifying sets, you will see sloppy details which will not show up on even 65\" sets. I have noticed that subtle images prevalent in use during credits show up rather obviously on this set. You also do not want to sit too close to this set. Within 5 feet, it looks not too smooth. My seats are 8-10' from screen, and it works as I hoped. This screen size accomplishes exactly what I had hoped for - filling the room like a theater - type impact, putting to rest my 65\" wanting for more.I believe this is a set which requires great sourcing. If you watch primarily Blu-ray, or HD cable or satellite you will likely be satisfied; if your sourcing is less than stellar, I do believe your results will not be so good.Delivery was good and timely. Although this unit is not heavy by specs, its mass mandates 2-3 people for even simple moving. I am using the stand not a wall mount. It too seems to keep the TV at a bit of a flimsy feeling state though.I am not a technical reviewer; I am a practical reviewer. If you need specs, read the spec sheets. I try to help others with the practical; does it do what it is suppose to. In summary, this is going to work very well for my desired uses and circumstances, and for only having to spend in the 3K range, it will eliminate my desire to go for the LG for 3-5X as much. I don't believe I can get that much more reward for that extra money. Knowing that I will use 90% plus Blu-ray and other direct HD sourcing I think the blemishes will be very minor.

I never had to point it directly at the bottom left corner, but yeah, its not bluetooth, so you do have to point it AT the TV.This TV has the picture quality of other TVs in the 3500 dollar range. If this screen doesn't look unbelievably amazing when you look at it at a store, ask for the remote and simply change the setting to \"calibrated\" or \"vivid\". You'll see the difference immediately!!! The picture quality made both my dad and brother walk away saying, \"K, I need one of those now...\" and my dad has never even owned an HDTV yet. He's old school, but it sounds like I'll be going to help him pick one up soon.As an FYI, I did use the Disney WOW Bluray Wow: World of Wonder [Blu-ray] to calibrate it perfectly and I am thrilled, but even without it, the settings in \"calibrated\" mode were pretty close as it was. But for those videophiles like myself, get a calibration Bluray like that and utilize it if possible for all of your TVs. I highly recommend that product as well.Overall, I am thrilled with this TV and I feel no need to get a 4K TV at this point.

Amazing 3D!", "Author": "Winston", "ReviewID": "R3ANLGDO5REO41", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased the 65 inch Vizio M series, and after 2 months of use, I must say it is really wonderful. Below are some positives and negatives about the television.Appearance: This TV definitely has the WOW factor. The bezel is extremely slim around the screen, and it is a really nice look. It almost seems like the TV has no bezel. The sides of the TV bezel are sliver, and look great against the wall (we mounted ours). The small VIZIO tag in the bottom left corner of the TV is not a distraction at all. When we have friends over, they always mention how nice our TV looks.Build: A lot of people say that VIZIO makes cheaper televisions. I really do not see that here. The build seems extremely sturdy, and the TV frame is manufactured out of some nice metal. I do not like the stand it comes with, but that's not a problem since we mounted our TV. One thing I don't like about the build is that the HDMI and other component inputs are on the opposite side of the power adapter on the back of the TV. It makes for a little difficulty when mounting the TV and running cables through the wall, but not a major complaint.Picture: The picture on this TV is outstanding. We have a blu-ray player, and stream HD movies from amazon and Netflix, and none have seem to disappoint as of yet. The colors really pop. I will say that when we are viewing a SD (standard definition) channel on our cable service, there is some light bleeding at the top of the screen (small pixels of white light). This only happens on very few standard definition channels, usually when they are airing commercials.3D: The 3D on this TV is also fabulous. It has passive 3D, which in my opinion, is much better than the active 3D of many other new TV's. Don't know the difference? Well, this VIZIO uses the same type of 3D as movie theaters, called passive 3D, which simply means you can put on a pair of light weight glasses and enjoy the show (8 pairs of glasses included with the 65' model). Active 3D requires heavier (battery powered) glasses, that have shuttering lenses, to flicker and block out images at certain points. What this boils down to is more of a headache and a less pleasurable experience when viewing active 3D. The glasses for active 3D are also SUPER pricey. One important note: Even though this TV has passive 3D like the theaters, things don't tend to pop/jump out as much as they do in the theater. But it is still wonderful! (I suggest after purchasing the TV to go on the VUDU application and search for Disney's: A Christmas Carol trailer. This is a wonderful 3D trailer to show off the 3D to your friends, and this particular trailer has some images that do jump out at you (snowflakes!)).Sound: The sound is pretty good on this TV (no complaints), and what I really like is that you can't see a single speaker on the thing! It is really sleek! Note: Vizio does also offer a sound bar to go with the TV on their web site. It retails for around $250.00SMART TV Features: The apps seem to be all here, and they work just fine. The Smart TV features are somewhat slow to respond to your input on the remote control, but not horrendously slow. The controller has 3 buttons dedicated to certain apps: a Netflix button, amazon video button, and another movie application button. I personally love these, as it takes no navigating to open up Netflix or Amazon video! Great design on the remote control. A downside to the remote control is that it IS NOT universal, so it won't control your cable box or anything.", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sweet TV", "Author": "Troy W Schliem", "ReviewID": "R364CBOXU5XQAQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the VIZIO M651d-A2R 65-Inch from Amazon to replace a Sony 60 inch DLP TV that I have had for nearly 7 years. After 3 days I am extremely happy with the purchase.  I wanted to replace the old set partly because of the space it took up and partly becuase the technology has changed so much in the last few years.  I wanted to stay with at least the same screen size or larger for under $2000.  That led me to the Vizio M651-A2R.  I have owned Sony and Samsung in the past and I can say without a doubt this is the best TV in terms of picture and feature-functionality I have ever had.First the negatives...It took 12 days to get it from the time I ordered it. A little longer than I expected but the delivery company was great.  We took it out of the the box and set it on the floor but could not get the TV to power up using the remote.  It looked like the remote was functional as the backlighting was working on the unit but we could not get it to work.  Then we tried looking for the manual power on button and finally found it.  It is an unmarked small square button in the rear of the lower left corner. (Not sure why they don't set it off in red or something so you can find it easier)  After using the manual power on the TV powered up just fine but we still could not get the remote to work.  Come to find out the sensor for the remote is in the lower left corner on the very bottom of the unit so the sensor was covered by the carpet which is why the remote would not work.  I had remembered reading about the remote being touchy on some of the reviews. Once we hung it on the wall the remote seems to work just fine. I only mention all of this in case you have the same issues but really it wasn't a big deal once we got it mounted.The picture is amazing. After fine-tuning the set, which is very easy to navigate using the TV's menu, the picture looked even better. I used many of the basic recommendations found in other comments here as a starting piont and then tweaked them slightly to get it to my liking.  The design of the TV is very attractive especially mounted on the wall (I used the $25 wall mount kit recommended by Amazon for this unit) Connecting to the WiFi was a breeze and the firmware updated on it's own after the first night.So here are the pro's and cons:Cons:- Touchy remote but not a big deal once mounted on the wall- Speaker sound OK (Assumption is you will connect this to an AV system anyway)Pros:- Amazing Picture- Price (By far the most TV for the price)- Easy to use features- Attactive Design (it looks amazingly sleek mounted on the wall)I highly recommend this TV.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Vizio 60 \"M-Series Review (M601d-A3R)", "Author": "Ashley", "ReviewID": "R1NT1AFB1F1SWM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Recently purchased this TV to replace a 58\" Samsung PNC550 Plasma which gave us multiple problems and services before finally saying enough is enough.Image Quality:  Image Quality is superb, there are multiple options but we went with the Calibrated Darkened option with a few tweaks.  There is almost zero light bleed from the corners of the panel and you have to look at the TV at an extreme angle (think 140+ degrees) to see otherwise it's completely black while looking dead on or very off center.  This is probably do to smart dimming, when viewing letterboxed content the black bars are ink black and in  scenes where the picture supposed to be black it blends in remarkably with the black borders.It is \"almost\" plasma like but something like the Panasonic's will still provide something closer to true blacks.Sound Quality:  Bad to Horrible, watching movies are a horrible experience with the built in speakers.  Most all TV speakers are inadequate but these are somehow worse.Gaming: There is no ghosting on this panel while in game mode.  The TV automatically switches to game mode for me and remembers my settings.  There is also no input lag at all, everything is quick and responsive.  I am very sensitive to this as a PC Gamer and cannot play anything with Vsync due to input lag.Design:  Incredible design, I hate thin bezels with the silver chrome color or clear glass sticking out.  This approach is nice and clean while the Vizio tab is very small and not something that is in your face.  I love clean aesthetics both in my living room and with my computers.  Chrome, Silver, and other \"fancy\" looks do not suit me in the least.Remote: Bad, you have to point it directly at he bottom left corner but I have heard Vizio will update it somehow.  But as it is it's bad, I have a universal remote but the actual remote itself could be improved.Smart Apps:  Who cares?Misc:  You're going to want a sound bar or a Home Theater setup, the sound while watching movies is bad, it is acceptable for TV sitcoms or News but otherwise for the price all I care about is the panel itself.I purchased the S4251 Soundbar and it is awesome for the money, soundbars usually perform poorly but this set and the upcoming 52\" one are worthy of the price should you not have the funds (or space) to buy a real 5.1 setup.Notes -Some forum posters have identified a small darker line around the outside of the images which are on various forums and internet video sites.  My 60\" panel does not have this with or without smart dimming.I am on the 1.05 firmware.The only things I look for in TV's are aesthetics and picture quality and this TV delivers.  That is what I am rating, not the sound quality.If you really want a 60\" and do not care about sound quality, do not care about apps, and have a limited budget this TV should be on the top of your list.

This model line of HDTV from Vizio features only one button on the HDTV itself.That one button serves two purposes.  The first function is to turn the HDTV off and on.  The second purpose is to cycle through your video inputs.  Accessing ANY other function for this HDTV REQUIRES the remote control.For some this is not a deal-breaker, but what if your remote breaks?  How much will it cost to replace?  Most, if not all, universal remotes only offer the most basic functions of the OEM remote.

I had planned on getting him a Samsung since that is the one he currently has and I also have now. I decided to look some more and came across the Vizio TV's. My mother has a Vizio and she loves it. When I purchased this TV I had free shipping and the company brought the TV on time on the day they said they would and I was able to track the package. The shippers plugged in the TV to make sure there was no damage in transit and to make sure the screen came on. I was very happy with the service. The 3D looks amazing on this TV and I loved that I can use my Galaxy 4 to play Youtube videos on it. I tested the 3D with a clip on Youtube of Avatar and it looks amazing. The glasses are the same as the ones you would use in the movies so you dont have to worry about batteries or replacing them with expensive glasses. I received 8 pairs of glasses. The frame is slim  and it looks so sleek. The only thing that my father has complained about is that the remote signal to to TV is not so good if you have something in front of the sensor and that he would like the remote to have a keyboard. The signal does not bounce off the walls so you have to point it directly in front of the TV which he is annoyed about but its not a big deal. He also was not able to register the TV online because the site did not have the model to check off but I was able to call the toll free number on a Saturday and the rep was more then happy to register it on his end. The only issue that has really come up is that the TV has turned off on its own on different occasions. When I spoke to a rep we did a hard set on the TV by holding down the power button for 30 seconds and plugging in the TV directly into the wall instead of using the power strip. He said that could be why the TV was turning off on its own because it was not getting enough power. Since we did that the TV has not turned off on its own anymore but if it does I will be calling the company again. The picture quality is amazing and the price is awesome.

I just set it up yesterday, and bottom line is that it works fine and I am pleased and have not had second thoughts. However, to help those considering this model and those about to do set-up, I have these important points which I hope VIZIO would take time to read carefully:1) There is only 1 set of connection for older components. There are however 3 HDMI ports, but if you have a VCR, and older DVD, you're stuck in that you can only plug in one set of the 3-prong rca connections. I would have preferred another set.2) TV stand, though requiring the three screws, is not that stable overall. Could be more stable, was flimsy while trying to install cables.3) The remote is not going to be fun using for the long term use...keys are not easily differentiated and it's frustrating especially when you have to keep inputting one button at a time for many of the apps (as in navigating amazon, you tube, etc.) I suppose having a full size keyboard would have been desirable in this situation. One user noted the center \"V\" button for launching the apps. I agree. That button could have been labelled better. This is an issue as I am using my Comcast remote for basic remote functions (power, volume, channel), but I use the VIZIO one for advanced functions and the design of this could have been more intuitive and functional.  The bottom line is that the buttons which I'll be using the most on the VIZIO remote are not fun to use.3) More important is that the wired inputs in the back side are under a recessed groove area: the ethernet slot will not accommodate the ethernet cables having the rubber grips. It will not go all the way in and \"click\". So I had to use another ethernet cable without the rubber grips. If you've seen the different kinds of ethernet cables, you'll know what I mean. I am using the Category 5E ones, and my connection is blazing fast.4) And most important is that coaxial cable slot is not reliable. I had to try many times, and my thumb and index fingers were numb from the loose threading and failure of the cable to fully fit into place. I believe there is not enough room for the end of the cable to fit fully into the groove and it does not catch the thread. I had to push in the cable, (hence the instability issue mentioned in issue above).  And, finally, because of the recessed groove area on back of the unit, the cable (especially the coaxial being thick and less flexible) has to bend into place. This is a design flaw and not a good one in my opinion.I want to stress that the above items were definitely not a deal breaker for me but had I known about these issues, I'd have set up the VIZIO much quicker and without hassles. I spent a great deal of time frustrated over the coaxial cable issue and had to dig around and wait until I could find the thin-end ethernet cable.As for what I enjoy:1) Speakers are pretty good. I've always enjoyed VIZIO speakers on their TVs (this is the 4th VIZIO model I've had).2) Picture is pretty good, though I am new to this type of TV.  I have no idea about the \"calibration\" tips and techniques. I'd be happy to learn about this.3) All apps so far have worked really well. Amazon was a breeze (signed-in and got to get confirmation code), same with YouTube (off of my google account). One user noted issues with YouTube; Ive had none so far.4) I don't mind at all the \"VIZIO\" product tab on the bottom far right corner. It's kind of unique and artistically nice but I gather some folks are hating it. There is also the optionally turned on \"power light\" on the bottom far left corner. I left it on and I presume lots of folks would want to disable it.5) I like how slim and light weight it is.Oh, cable tv channel set up was not easy. Comcast has it's own protocol, and VIZIO has it's own. It took a while for it to get settled. My set up is via coaxial cable from wall to Comcast's Digital adapter box (just to convert cable signals to Comcast) and then another coaxial cable from that device to the VIZIO.  I used ethernet connection to my router. My download speed was ~15000kbps. I was easily able to watch the HD preview on the Amazon app without a glitch.As for the firmware updates, I am not aware of any issues and I have not dabbled with that. I am hoping all is fine there.It's only been a day but I'll keep you posted of things. Hopefully, it'll be a great quality product to enjoy for years to come.  I know I took a chance ordering online from Amazon as a pricey item like this, being big and bulky, was a concern (note: they deliver it as is in the original factory box> all will know that you're getting a VIZIO TV> I have some privacy issues on this, but hey at least the delivery folks know it's a tv and is delicate)", "Date": "July 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "great tv at a great price", "Author": "Mathew", "ReviewID": "RKVGHRI9JES5W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only had this TV for a week or so.

So I compromised by seeking out the most feature laden TV for the least cash outlay.  Vizio was it.  I confess that I had to compromise.  Yes, it's a 55\" instead of the desired 65\" Samsung I was hoping for.  That said, it does still have the Smart TV functionality, 240 Hz refresh rate and the 3D Functionality I would have gotten with the Sammy.  Also Vizio provided 8 3D glasses vs. Samsung which included fewer.Since this TV cost me well less than one third what the Samsung cost, I was prepare to compromise on picture quality.  The wonderful thing is that I am find that the compromise was minimal, if any.  The colors, brightness, and clarity of this TV seem nothing short of excellent.  Non 3D Blue-ray Movies (and other 1080 P content) look almost 3D, but WITH OUT the the glasses.  There is such a fine depth of focus that it literally seems close to three dimensional.  The screen has the small bezel and the new edge Lit screen.  The colors are bright and vivid and the remote is very functional.  Also worth mentioning, the Smart Apps are complete, very intuitive, and offer a lot of additional value.While I may need to butter up the the better half first, my plan is to move this TV to the bedroom in the next year or so and still get the large TV.  The only change in my plans are that I will now buy the 75\" Vizio (of this model).  I suspect the price of the larger units will come down in time but even now one can get the Smart, 75\" 240hz 3D for less than the price of a similar 65\" Samsung.I'm very impressed with this Series of Vizio HDTV's.

Downside: wifi security issue", "Author": "KreeH", "ReviewID": "R27L45WR9L11YW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Yesterday, our new M801d-A3R 80-Inch television was delivered and these are my first impressions.Prior to this purchase, over time we have purchased three Panasonic plasma's and had been planning on upgrading from a 58\" to a 65\" but after their odd decision to kill their plasma product line, I decided to consider other options.  IMO, plasma has a superior picture over LCD for low light movie viewing. So, if we couldn't match the picture quality, we wanted to get something else in it's place.  I considered 4K but, a number of factors kept me from pursuing: a) too high a cost, b) no real source of viewing material (1080p Blueray is barely common place), c) early technology learning-curve is still too steep. Plus, I'm not sure if resolution is really an issue unless your viewing distance is really close.In the end,  we opted for viewing screen size (\"bigger is better\") ... 80\" is a huge improvement! At first, I was worried that maybe we overdid it and given our 10' seating distance, the picture quality would be too grainy. This turned out to be true for lower resolution, 480i OTA television and to lessor degree 720p, but 1080i looks great. The screen size actually allows you to see more background images that are easily missed at lower screen sizes.  Our viewing consists of OTA, Netflix (PS3) and after upgrading, Blueray DVD (added $4/month). Our first movie as Blueray \"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\".  The size of the screen and picture quality resulted in a much more cinema-like experience.  It was more enjoyable than our 58\" plasma. The picture quality was good and did not diminish our viewing enjoyment. Note I used the calibrated dark screen pre-settings.  For a cinematic experience, I give it 5-stars.The remote isn't great, but it isn't crap either.  It works fine. I will agree that for such a nice television, it would of been nice if it had more of a premium feel, but for this price, they had to cut corners somewhere.  I really think that in terms of bang-for-the-buck, this television is best currently available. This didn't effect my score.The one area which is a pain and I am having trouble with is the WIFI setup. Usually, for most devices, this is super easy. Once you type in your security password you're done.  With this TV, it has not been the case.  While the TV shows I am connected with good signal strength, it shows \"download not available\".  I have a PS3, XBOX, and computer all in the same room which have no issues connecting and our WAC/router is a Netgear R7000. In searching the internet, I see some folks with this problem disable their WIFI WPA-PSK security, and built a limited access MAC-Adress list. This seems like a marginal/painful solution.  I use WIFI security on a very large number of devices without issues. Luckily, the PS3 has no issue and this is my main movie streaming device. Still, I will continue to try to find a solution, but this aspect of the TV drops a star (too bad we don't have 1/2 stars).Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and feel I made the right choice.

The picture quality looks great. Everyone that comes over thinks the TV is really nice. It's sleek and simple and the picture and sound work very nicely. I went over to a friend's place who had a more expensive brand (but a slightly older model) and the picture quality and sharpness of the color on my new TV was loads better. I looked around for a while and just kept coming back to this one. My other TV is a Vizio and I've had it for 7 years and still works the same as the day I got it. I am hoping this one will also last as long but that will be determined. When I purchased the old one, it was at the same price range as other competitors. Now it seems to be a bit more of a best bang-for-your-buck TV. Either way, for the price, I will not complain if it doesn't last as long as the other one; however, I'd be very happy if it did :-) Come on Vizio, don't let me down! I would definitely recommend anyone buy this TV.As far as some of the logistics and/or complaints from other reviews. I found some of the same issues. The installation was super easy. I got the 47in. and definitely would have been useful to have another person help set it up but I managed just fine. The default sound and picture settings are a bit odd so I used the recommendations someone used in one of their reviews and now it looks perfect. The remote is a bit funky. I have found that when the back is totally snapped on, it doesn't have good communication with the set but if I leave it slightly open in the back, it works fine. I know I could probably just ask for a replacement but I don't care enough about it :-) The apps leave a bit to be desired. Sometimes they take a bit of time to load but there is no delay in the actual loading/playing of the movie or show (no constant buffering or anything). Netflix and Hulu work great. Amazon prime interface could use a bit of work but easy to use if you know what you want to watch. I also wish they had actual showtime instead of just the preview.  But, for the most part, it has the popular ones and they are easy to use and work great. I haven't had any issues with the wireless internet connection but the TV is also in the same room as the router so I'm sure that helps. I also recently discovered I can cast things from my iphone (or samsung galaxy) for the apps already installed (mostly just hulu and netflix) like you would for chromecast.

To be honest, I didn't \"need\" 3D, nor did I feel like I needed \"SMART\" TV functions.

I calibrated the display and found the black level was decent but, literally couldn't get close to the detail of the Plasma (I expected this so, I didn't ding the rating for this) but, the Colors really popped giving the Plasma a run for its money.Essentially, the Picture can look awesome and the black levels are good enough for the most part but, nowhere near the best LED or Plasmas on the market.  Sharpness out of the box was too high and I set mine to 10 where detail became much more pleasing to look at.VIEWING ANGLESThis right here, is one area where I ding the TV badly!  If you look at the TV directly, the picture is awesome but, step 3 feet to the right or left of center and everything gets washed out with a noticeable degrade in image quality.  Step another 2 feet in either direction and the image starts to flashlight and contrast flattens severely!My wife usually sits right in front of the TV and I'm usually off to the side so, she didn't notice it and I absolutely hated the TV because of the few drawbacks.AESTHETICSOkay, the build quality and finish of the design are very nice in terms of the televisions styling.  What's not so nice, is the very glossy screen!Our living room is literally right off the main entrance to the house (as most in America are) and if somebody opens the door on a sunny day, this TV became a huge white reflection where almost nothing was visible through the glare until the door closed.  Some days people would come and go so often I couldn't watch the TV.Oh and one more note, the Panel is not 240Hz as it uses the backlighting to simulate that refresh rate and Vizio's own documentation makes note of that so, consider that when buying.Needless to say, the TV lost points here as well.CALIBRATIONThis is fairly complex in that you're trying to find that optimal point for black level that doesn't have an excess amount of noise.  Of course all this was exacerbated by the viewing angles as you're also looking for any setting that could make that better while trying to optimize the picture but, overall, it wasn't the easiest process as the number issues to overcome adds to the complexity.REMOTEThe remote was very stylish and functional but, implementation was flawed.  If I didn't point the remote to the lower left corner of the screen the remote was spotty and nonfunctional at best.  This made it tough to put my Xbox One in front of the TV with a cable box and AppleTV as the space was severely limited.CONCLUSIONif you're in the market for 3D LED TV and your viewing area is fairly narrow, then you will likely love this TV.  If you have grandeur expectations of viewing the TV at wide angles, you really should look elsewhere.For me, I stepped back to the Vizio E701 class and found that TV for $100 more (Retail) has been an overall better viewing experience even if it isn't 3D (which I never really use anyway).", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Super HDTV at a Super Price", "Author": "johnnyg618", "ReviewID": "R33L80PJ2VNNLL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is all that it was advertised to be, as a high quality hdtv.

But this TV doesn't seem to have the ability. I know it is not the TV itself but more of the crappy version of the app that's installed. Hopefully future software updates will address some of the lack luster apps. Youtube is not as friendly either. On my other TV, I can find a youtube using my iPhone and then hit a button to have it play on my other TV and it will start playing.

The stand is heavy duty and looks very nice, we chose to wall mount ours though.*It has an amazing picture, not just for it's price.*The sound is fantastic, we are audiophiles and have been amazed by the quality and level of sound.*The \"smart TV\" functions are decent, there are minimal apps but it has YouTube, Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime (the latter does not have a fully Integrated UI at the moment, it does have a very usable sidebar menu though).*It picks up my wireless flawlessly, which was a main concern as we stream all media in our household.*The remote is backlit and functions well, although we have not linked component info to it because we wirelessly stream DVDs, etc via Airplay and use iOS \"remotes\" for those functions.THE BAD*If our first set is an indication, there may be a few bad apples out there. Buy from a retailer with a good return policy.*Touching the right side of the set seams to interfere with it's wireless for a few seconds. Not much of an issue, but when moving it on a wall mount expect a little pixelation for a few frames.Addressing common issues that I worried about before purchasing  -Remote - Our remote works very well, the IR sensor is not in the bottom right corner Vizio symbol as many believe but in the opposite corner of the set. If you have normal height ceilings it easily bounces off and back to the set as well.Buzz/whir/cricket noises - If your set makes loud/high pitched noises get it repaired or replaced ASAP. This is not normal and a sign of a board malfunction or electrical problem. Our first set emitted a very loud squealing noise coming from the top right corner when plugged in but not powered on, as well as a very loud spinning (sounded like VCR rewinding) noise coming from the center of the set.

But after 14+ years with a Samsung LCD TV I was ready to move up to an LED. I had inquired with friends about the VIZIO models and received generally positive reviews.  I also tend to use my tv to play games so I was looking for one with a good response time and this one seemed fit that bill so opted to give this one a shot.The Good: It's picture is incredible. Crystal clear, runs much cooler than my LCD tv ever did. Setup was a snap, and surprisingly I used more of the smart features than I thought I would.The Bad: It's speakers didn't have the clarity of my previous TV and that was somewhat of a letdown. Had sort of a \"tinny\" sound to it but after switching it do dynamic sound I noticed it less. The remote sucks, the buttons are barely functioning and you really need to press hard to get a reaction out of them so make sure you sync up your universal remote quickly. The power button is small and hidden in the back, and the instructions don't let you know its there. I felt like an idiot trying to figure out how to turn it on without the remote.The Worst: This was the deal breaker with this TV. When the power of the TV is off, you will start to receive a high pitched whirring from the board that the power connects to. It can best be described as a Camera's Flash charging up or a Space Laser firing. It started off very low and barely audible, but as the days pass on it gets progressively louder. Its incredibly annoying and in a reasonably small room it makes it difficult to sleep. I had sent mine back and received a replacement from amazon only to find that this television did it as well and eventually it got worse.its a shame because I was enjoying this TV but that sound was completely intolerable and the only sure fire way to fix it was to unplug the tv. That is a major inconvenience. This might have been ok in a larger room or one that I might not always be in, but for a bedroom TV this was a no go.

Then it did it again and on the 3rd time my daughter was watching tv and it started to flash and shut off. I got on the phone with Vizio CS and was told that if it did it again they would send a repair man out to replace the power supply pack in the tv. And after like 15 minutes of hanging up with them it shut off again and back on the phone I was with CS. This time they told me to unplug the tv from my Monster Surge protector which I have my Bose system plugged into along with other electronics. I had just calibrated the tv setting all the colors to the perfect settings and so on They told me I had to reset all the TV settings and bring it back to the factory settings so with some hesitations I did and and I had recalibrate and reset the easy to use remote but a piece of junk remote at that. But every time it shuts off I have to reset the remote to all my Components I have. And after 4 days of the last call to CS it shut off again this morning and once again I had to reset the remote to control everything like the cable box I did not pair my Bose system this time with the remote and as soon as I'm done with this review I am calling CS and demand them to fix this problem.

I did, however, purchase the VIZIO S4251w-B4 5.1 Soundbar with Wireless Subwoofer and Satellite Speaker (also from Amazon) and it just completes the whole TV watching experience. The sound now matches the stunning picture quality, and together, awes me every time I turn them on.And finally, the remote..... It is NOW flawless! There has been a recent update which fixed the remote control issue and now it is working 100x better. All you have to do is turn on the TV and update the software to install this fix. I can now pretty much point the remote in any direction and the TV will pick up the signal easily. I'm not really sure how they fixed the remote control problem but they DID!My ONLY real concern regarding this TV is it's longevity. I rarely purchase extended warranty plans for electronics and THUS, did not do so for this TV. Hopefully, it does not bite me in the you know what, but so far so good.

Now I know it's not much to make a fuss out of it, but one dead pixel right out of the box? That didn't sit too well for me. Especially since I'm afraid it's defective and the screen will be completely dead. So I called up Amazon and they gladly assisted me without any hesitation at all.

They're not always the most tech-savvy and the learning curve on new technology is a little slow.

I own a Vizio E-series LCD TV and a Vizio Blu-ray player and this TV combines the best of both and does it better.

My only complaints are really with the apps.  While there are quite a few apps, I would like to see an online database with many more apps.  Spotify, Chive...some apps that would be nice to have.

If you don't use any of the smart features, the TV would get a firm 5 star rating. However, we buy smart TVs for a reason. We want to use those apps! Upon arrival, the TV updated itself just fine. Everything seemed to work, if you knew how to butter that remote to have it operational at least 90% of the time. YouTube app would crash every time on power up. It would change TV resolution, so all the icons were huge. If not that, it would not play anything or shut the TV off. When you turn the TV back on, none of the apps would load. Sometimes the TV would not come on at all after a crash like that. I had to disconnect it from power to reset. Within days of delivery, I was calling Vizio. Not fun, for such awaited TV. Been through all the hoops and resets, but all I got was that TV shouldn't do what it does. I didn't want to part with this picture, so I lived with the annoyance. Then came the 30th day after delivery, and on the very next day, imagine that, the crashes became severe. I wanted to watch something quick that day, but had a wrestling match with the TV for at least 20 minutes. After it \"warmed up\", it would act normal. The only thing is, Vizio says there shouldn't be any warm up times. And if there is, it shouldn't be 5-10 minutes on average. So this baby is going back.UPDATE: Replacement TV updated right away as well, but YouTube still crashes the TV. Being connected to a WIRED network, speed test gives inconsistent numbers, when ALL other devices show stable connection. When it works, YouTube constantly steps the video quality down and stays there. The original TV did the opposite. YouTube app interface is different from the original as well. I was told I don't have the latest firmware yet, hopefully an update is still coming. There is ONE positive thing though: on original TV we had a blurry corner only in 3D mode no matter what we watched. The replacement TV is all clean and sharp.CONCLUSION: TV is severely underpowered for really buggy apps. Lowering rating to 3 stars and hope it keeps showing great picture, because that's ALL is has going for it. If it keeps wasting my time with crashes even after an update, it's going back!

Took 8 screws to attach the bottom to the top and it was ready to go.*  Interfacing with the cable box and 3D Bluray player was seamless.  We just needed an HDMI cable for each.*  Setup took a total of 3 connections with the power cable.*  Picture quality is outstanding.  The black is very black and the colors are vibrant.*  Ambient light does not interfere significantly in the quality of the picture like it did with our older Vizio flatscreen with conventional backlight.*  Sound quality is good - par for this class of TV.*  Passive 3D quality is amazing.  With the included 8 pairs of viewing glasses this TV delivers a theater quality experience.*  Normal 2D viewing is better than we were getting with our older Vizio (which was pretty good)  and impressed us with its clarity and depth of color the first time we turned it on.*  The Vizio apps are easy to use and initialize quickly.  Connection to our wireless internet was very straight forward.*  It is a Smart TV, if you load a disc in the Bluray player, the TV will turn itself on and go to the proper HDMI input automatically.  The TV will automatically prompt you to select 3D mode when a 3D disc is in the player.*  TV volume is controlled by the cable remote.*  We added Boston Acoustics TVee One TV Speaker Base with Bluetooth to enhance and better control sound quality for various viewing experiences.  The Vizio M501d has a pedestal that fits perfectly on top of the speaker which fits perfectly in the space in our entertainment cabinet.In the spirit of keeping things simple, this is a set-up that our entire family can enjoy without having to wait for the resident AV/IT Tech to get home from work.", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beautiful picture.

I will summarize very briefly my INITIAL opinion as there are tons of other reviews out here.Pros:Outstanding picture quality - the picture on this unit is clearly a notch above some other LED sets i've seen and at this price point it is pretty damn super.  Even DVDs look much much better than my old set (Sony KDS50A2000 - an old set of course)3D is pretty good, although I don't have much experience with 3D on other sets, but with glasses and watching some demo clips on Youtube it was pretty realistic - depth was good and the picture definitely leaped out of the screen.  8 pairs of glasses are awesome.On screen interface is great - highly configurable and very simple to use.  Wifi is stable and was easy to setup without any issues.Remote is backlit, although it is a little weak it's nowhere near as bad as other reviews made it out to be...I have not had many issues with it not working.  However, I do use it mostly line of sight.  You have to aim it at the tv for it to work which is not unreasonable anyway.Cons:Screen is highly reflective and it may bother some people.  It's like a mirror!  Due to the other positives I will just deal with this.  At night I turn off or lower the lights anyway BUT if you have a light in the background the screen will be unusable due to the reflection.  This is not a unique issue for this set as many other sets have this issue these days including the Samsungs.A few issues with backlight bleed, at first it bothered me a bit but I lowered the backlight and now it is manageable.  This is just a characteristic of edge lit LED tv's so make sure this doesn't bother you.  It is not as pronounced as on other sets i've seen but there is some.Built in apps are hard to use without a keyboard and performance is an issue - Youtube buffered a lot and took a long time for videos to startup, the same clips played with zero lag on my mobile and my Chromecast so I know the problem is the Vizio apps.  I am of the opinion that all these TVs have crappy internet apps anyway so I plan to just get one of those Linux HTPCs and a wifi mouse/keyboard.  I have a Logitech Revue (Google TV) which is awesome in concept however it is extremely buggy and slow.Overall I am satisfied with the unit and will keep it, I bought it at Best Buy and asked them to match the Sams club price, so I paid $948 for it before taxes so I consider it a good deal for a unit with 3d, wifi and apps.Edit: After 2 wks of use - still love the TV, amazing picture and feel it's a good value for money compared to the Samsungs.  I am not so crazy about the apps, the Youtube works ok now after an update, Netflix works fine.  The other Yahoo apps such as weather and news absolutely suck - they are not designed to use the full screen but rather open up a small little window at the left of the screen and squeeze all the info in it, I HAVE 55 INCHES OF REAL ESTATE - USE ALL OF IT DAMNITT!!  The design of these Yahoo apps is RIDICULOUS!  Vizio needs to spend some time with the Roku 3 to see how a smart interface ought to be designed.  The Roku 3 just shames this \"Smart TV\" interface - not even a comparison.Besides the disappointment of the SMART aspect of the TV the rest seems to be pretty good!

The first was an LG 50\" plasma with the active 3D system, meaning the glasses were battery powered LCD active shutter type. The only complaint I had with the LG TV was with the glasses. Both the expense and comfort.There's a debate raging regarding which 3D system gives the best 3D experience. I was convinced by most everything I read on the subject that active was the way to go. Better resolution and brighter image were the main reasons. Well, I'm here to tell you, this Vizio blows that argument out the window.Not only is the 2D picture among the best I've ever seen on an HDTV, but the passive 3D is as close to theater quality as you're going to get. No heavy, bulky, expensive, battery powered 3D glasses here. It comes with 8 pairs of light and comfortable theater 3D specs but, since I wear Rx lenses, I bought a set of clip-ons for $10! With this model series, Vizio has employed a new technology for passive 3D called Sensio 3D. I can't pretend to understand it but it left me with my jaw on the floor. Google it to learn more about it.This model is considered a Smart TV, since it comes with all the most popular media streaming apps, Netflix, Amazon, Vudu, YouTube, etc. It also has a channel dedicated to 3D movies called 3DGO, from Sensio. Access to a router can be had via the set's built in wifi or an Ethernet port. The remote has dedicated buttons for Netflix and Amazon but access to the others is a bit clunky and slow. I use a Roku set-top box for all my streaming so this isn't an issue with me.The sound is also quite good although I don't use the TV speakers very often. You can adjust it using a multiband equalizer or just treble and bass. It also has a setting for DTS TruSurround for the internal speakers.The connections are all standard. Three HDMI inputs, component, optical digital audio out, even L/R RCA audio outputs. It's also got two USB ports.My only gripe with this TV is with the remote and access to menu items. After my experience with the LG remote and menu system, which is as good as it gets, I really was disappointed with Vizio's. The remote does have a nice backlight but that's about the only positive thing I have to say about it. Getting to menu settings which are used practically every day is not convenient or intuitive. I have learned to get used to it, but I will never like it.Even with the remote and menu complaints, I would recommend this TV without hesitation. The next best thing would be 4K and it'll be several years before you can get a 65\" 3D 4K set at anywhere near this price. I thought I'd miss my plasma's excellent picture. Plasma? What plasma?**UPDATE 3/14/14**UPDATE 3/14/14**UPDATE 3/14/14**One of the huge drawbacks of this TV was the necessity to point the remote exactly at the lower left corner of the screen. A firmware update yesterday fixed that problem. Now the remote operates the TV via your home WiFi. The remote now functions even from under a blanket. This is a huge plus. Now if only they would do something about the clunky menu navigation and make the often-used settings more easily accessible.

Since I have an Xbox One I don't use the built in Smart-apps.Pros:* This is the best TV at the price point for the following reasons --> It's super slim --> The Edge-to-edge picture is amazing. The bezel is small and looks so much better than any Samsung I could find. --> The picture quality and blacks are amazing. The closest I could find was for a twice as expensive Samsung. --> the 240hz makes a huge difference. HD tv, sports and gaming and super crisp and much less pixalated than the much more expensive TVs I compared side-by-side to from Samsung, LG and Sharp. Going up over $1k you can definitely find a better image. But this TV so far seems to best to me between the 1k and 2k price range.Cons* As said in other reviews, the remote kind of sucks as you have to press really hard to change channels.* The glass is very reflective. So any glare will reduce the quality of the picture you are looking at.* Speakers -> They are average for TVs with this small of a profile. I bought a 5.1 audio system (also by Vizio) since I want to hang both on the wall. It's I no way bad, but slim tvs in general don't have great audio.* Not extremely bright. The auto-dimming seems a bit wonky. I haven't customized ANY of the picture setting yet, so need to play with dimming, contrast, brightness, etc. This default settings are acceptable for me, but it does seem dimmer than some TVs.Other:* I bought the Vizio 5.1 Sound bar for this thing and find the combo of this TV, the Soundbar and the XBox One to be amazing.The default remote for the TV can turn on and off the sound-bar, so you don't need a separate remote. It's also super compatible with the Xbox one, so I can use my voice to turn all 3 things on \"Xbox on\", turn off all 3 \"Xbox turn off\", and things like Volume \"Xbox turn volume down\" work great as well.

It is really light and I can lift it by myself without much trouble. The 3D picture on the TV isn't bad with some movies looking better than others.

The reason why is because I want a local store to be able to return this product to in case I don't like it. Televisions are difficult to shop for and are too much of a hassle to ship back in my opinion.I originally purchased the 55\" E series and returned it because I didn't feel that it handled judder correctly. I decided to try the 55\" M series due to a review on CNET reviews. I was again disappointed on how it handled judder. While watching Transformers Dark Side of the Moon the opening fight scene in space was painful to watch on both televisions. The screen jerked during the panning shots and the quality of picture looked bad.Then I found out that the problem was the source. I had been predominantly watching movies on Netflix and after searching through some AV forums I found out that Netflix is most likely the culprit because of how much they compress the feed. When I did a comparison of Transformers Dark Side of the Moon on both Netflix and Amazon Prime, I noticed a gigantic difference. The Amazon version of the movie was better looking and had no judder (people are calling it jitter because judder has to do with the 2-3 pulldown) and the Netflix version looked unacceptable. Then I realized that I probably had returned my last television for no fault of its own. So from my understanding, and I may be wrong, Netflix isn't consistent in how it encodes and compresses its video feeds. One show may look excellent and another may look horrible. Not much we can do except complain.Anyway, there is pretty much nothing that can be done. Some people report no problems with jitter but I'm going to go out on a limb and assume that they don't notice judder/jitter because they are so used to seeing it already.On another note: I've also noticed that some Netflix movies and TV shows are encoded with the volume too loud which distorts the audio even at low volume. It's not my television as I've now discovered (and I don't have an external sound system) as I've now noticed this on more than one set while watching the same movie. For example, Football Factory (not sure if it's still offered) and some episodes of Futurama have their volume levels too high and it's very noticeable.So after all of that was discovered, I became a lot more sure of my purchase. I just moved so I am in the process of hooking up my blu ray player and media computer and I may update this review to report on how well this TV handles those sources soon. Feel free to comment here to remind me to report back if you don't see any additions.I pretty much like the default settings straight out of the box. This set has a nice picture. The colors don't \"pop\" as much as the E series did but the colors look rich and lush for this price point. The semi glossy screen helps the colors to stand out. I'm not saying that the colors are dim either, they just don't 'punch' into your eyeballs like the E series does.I haven't tried the 3D yet as I have no 3D movies to watch. There is no 3D content on Netflix that is compatible with Vizio at this time either. Not sure about Amazon. I kinda don't care about 3D since it hurts my eyes but I just found out that there is a 3D version of Dredd and I'm very interested in seeing it so if I go this route, I will also update my review here.The design of the TV is modern. Ultra thin silver-ish bezel and same color for the stand. The stand of the M series is more stable than the E series. The M series has more metal components to the stand than the E series.There are some cons, the M series relies on the remote controller for function as there is only a power button on the back. These remote control units are known to have problems and in fact, the remote that came with my set stopped functioning after 20 minutes. I replaced the batteries, restarted the TV etc but ended up having to go back too the store to swap it out. Thankfully Costco let me just grab a new controller instead of having to bring the entire set in.The controller is still kinda weird, if you point it slightly in the wrong way, it doesn't work. I haven't truly had much of a problem with it though as I adapted quickly. I also plan on buying a universal remote as someone else in the reviews has recommended.The sound is weird because the speakers are on the back. I'm used to it already but I was already planning on getting external sound sometime soon.There is a little bit of light bleed but I never notice when watching a program. There is some local dimming going on when watching movies that have the black bars above and below the picture so you don't see the light bleed in those instances either. It's a non issue to me.I haven't tried the apps since I have a Roku box and I may never use the local apps. We'll see.Some people complained about the semi gloss screen. It hasn't been too much of a problem for me. I still had a CRT TV up until recently and I'm used to seeing glare on the screen. The glare on the Vizio is less than my old CRT set actually so it seems like an improvement. The glare isn't that bad compared to the full on gloss that you see on other models though. I am able to control all of my lighting in case it ever becomes an issue.At this moment, I do recommend this set. It looks nice, the picture is nice, it is 240hz, does 3D, and is a smart TV.

Even reruns of old shows from the 70's look good considering they are standard def. I'm very happy with this and that it has 4 HDMI and 2 USB ports.I haven't tried 3d yet. I'm also using it with factory settings. I haven't watched sports or action movies yet, but when watching a show where something moves quickly across the screen, it looks odd. I'm not sure how to describe it, but I suspect that changing some settings would be better for sports.The remote is absolutely useless. Did I say useless? You have to point it EXACTLY at the IR receiver on the bottom left corner. If you point it at the bottom center or anywhere else, it does not work. I programmed our Tivo HD remote to control volume, but have had some trouble getting the TIVO's input and mute buttons programmed so far. I was hoping the problem was the batteries, but...no. Entering text can be tedious with such a crummy remote, so I temporarily plugged in a USB keyboard to set up accounts such as Netflix. The worked, except the shift key wouldn't work but maybe it's something about this specific keyboard. There's another model (prior model?) that has a remote with a slide-out keyboard and I've read that it works with this TV.Parental controls aren't impressive. I have not found a way to remove or control apps which are inappropriate for my young kids. It has a video app (forgot the name) that starts up by showing a few random suggested videos (from youtube??) and also offers access to videos from various cable network websites (I think the History Channel was one of them). The first time I brought up this app, the top two suggested videos were extremely inappropriate and very sexually suggestive. Parental controls do not apply to any apps including Netflix. Netflix on the XBox 360 uses parental control settings on the console. The Netflix app interface on this TV isn't very good, mostly because it doesn't show enough videos at once. I haven't explored other apps much and I don't know enough about smart TVs to compare them with other brands.App performance isn't terribly zippy, but I can't compare it to other smart TVs. The speakers are loud enough for TV watching, but they certainly don't sound rich. But then, TVs never provide home theater sound.I do love the picture on this TV and for the price, it is excellent, but you should use some of your savings for a Harmony remote, which I plan to order soon.I bought this at a local retailer.

Overall, I'm very happy with the tv but there are a few minor annoyances that keep it from being the bargain of the century (as is it's still a pretty good deal)Lets start with what's a slight irritant for me, but perhaps a major annoyance for you:The Picture settings should be different depending on what you're watching/playing:  This tv has several inputs and you can modify the picture settings for each input.  So for example, the settings for your cable tv input can be different than the settings for your dvd player input, and the tv will save the settings for each individual input.  When I first got the tv I used the same settings for my gaming input and my cable input.  That was a big mistake.  Despite being 240 hz, this tv has some pretty annoying motion blur problems.  What's motion blur? It's a weird sorta glimmering or shimmering effect that appears around certain points on screen whenever the camera is panning around.  For example, in Assassins Creed 4 for PS4 the camera spins around you whenever you climb a high point to synchronize.  The amount of motion blur I got during that sequence in the game would drive me nuts.  Same is true for when I watched cable tv.  After much tinkering around I discovered that using the \"Computer\" setting in the picture settings menu for cable tv and video games significantly reduced the amount of motion blur. When watching cable tv the computer setting reduced motion blur entirely.  Nat Geo Wild and Football never looked so good.What about motion blur during blu ray movies? Well, for blu-rays, I change the setting to \"Calibrated\" and adjust the lighting just a little.  Yes, there is slight motion blur on calibrated even when watching a blu-ray, but you can go with the computer setting here as well if you don't want to deal with that.  I use calibrated for blu rays because I like the smooth almost HD camcorder like quality you get when watching movies.  It's like it's coming in at 60 fps compared to 30 (gamers will get that reference) so I don't mind the occasional motion blur during scenes where the camera is spinning around someone.I would love to share my exact settings, but I can't and the reason why is tied to my next point:The BadNo buttons on the tv itself other than one on the back of the tv. What do I mean by no buttons? There's no channel up or down button, no volume buttons, no input button, no menu button...nothing.  I'd say it's like a computer monitor but even those have buttons on them. Now maybe there's a way to use the one button on the back of the tv to do a combination of things (I know if you hold it down the tv shuts off and on), but it's really weird that in this day and age a tv would come out missing something so common. It really puts you in a bind when the remote is missing or when your girlfriend's son comes over and breaks the remote, which is what happened to me about a week ago.  It's not really so bad as I can still use the cable remote the majority of the things, but I can't access my picture settings and I can't access the TV's smart apps.  Guess I have to order another remote and keep up locked up and away.Sound: I'm not going to be too critical here because almost all flat screens have horrible sound. You'll definitely want to consider purchasing a sound bar to compensate for the loss of sound quality.What's okay:Smart TV Functionality/Apps: Having access to Netflix, Pandora, Amazon prime, Yahoo and several other apps is really cool. Why is it just okay? Because the UI (user interface) for most of these apps is just horrible. By that I mean there's no clear indicator of what you're selecting, only certain ways to go back to what you were just looking at, etc etc.  Combine this with the bad remote sensor and the first time using some of these apps can be really frustrating. Speaking of the remote sensor...Now on to the not so bad, but kinda weird.The remote sensor: You literally have to aim the remote at the lower left-hand side of the tv in order for the command to be detected.  Not necessarily a major detraction, but remote sensors aren't exactly cutting edge tech. Heck, my tv (which I purchased in the late 90s) could detect remote commands when I was pointing the remote at the ceiling. It's weird that this tv can't detect a command unless the remote is pointed at one specific spot. Not that I felt a blu tooth remote sensor should've been used, but Vizio must have really used cheap remote sensor tech here because if you're not aiming at that right spot you'll be pushing the button over and over wondering what's going on.  This was especially fun when I got the tv home and was setting it up for the first time.  Now, if you have cable or satellite your universal remote will work just fine with this tv and you won't have to deal with this.  If you don't have cable and you have to use the tv's remote to switch channels, adjust volume, etc then you're going to have to train yourself to point the remote at the target area in order for the tv to receive the command.Oh, and while we're talking about the remote:Prepare to buy lots of AA batteries if you use the tv remote as your primary remote.  Most remotes nowadays have a \"light\" button which when pressed will cause a bac- light behind all the buttons on the remote to come on so you can see what button is what when in the dark? Pretty helpful.  This remote has that too but I guess Vizio figured it was such a helpful feature that the remote should do it every time you press a button.  Not a problem except for the fact that the light coming on every time you press a button causes the remote to drain batteries like crazy.  I didn't have cable for the first three months I had the tv and I must've replaced the batteries at least 2 or 3 times. I've had cable these last three months and I haven't replaced the batteries in my universal remote once.By now you're probably wondering what I liked about the tv?The picture.  It's really great.  Granted, it took almost six months of constantly messing with the settings but I more or less have it where I want it.  Computer settings for games and cable is great and the picture rivals just about anything you'd see on the show floor within 200 bucks of this tv's price.  Granted, still having some motion blur while watching blu-rays kinda stinks but it's not so bad. The 3D is decent and they include 8 glasses.  If your a tech savy guy or gal and you don't mind tinkering with the settings then by all means, it's a great purchase.  In hindsight though I'm not sure I'd buy this tv again as the 240 hz really seems nonexistent and I think I could get similar results out of an 120 hz tv.Update: Vizio's customer service just flat out rocks!  It's been so long since I spoke to someone that listened, was respectful and just sounded like a nice person who I wasn't bothering with my problem.

Sazanowicz", "ReviewID": "R1ILR2XZB28231", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "(Background: I purchased this TV open box at a local big box store.  I was only comfortable doing so as the tv was actually on the wall and running.  There was no visible cosmetic damage to the unit, no dead pixels, and the accessories were included (minus the 3d glasses, which I don't care for anyway).  For all intents and purposed this review is solely for the product.)The TV is gorgeous, and fairs really well with a lot of the more expensive brands.  The remote leaves a little to be desired as it is a bit slow, but this is only a minor inconvenience, one I'd gladly save a few hundred dollars for over the more expensive Samsung or LG units.  The picture clarity and color accuracy are fantastic for an LCD which was my main reason for purchasing.  I'm a gamer so plasmas were out of the question due to high input lag.The bezel is very thin and stylish.  The stand is basic, but has a modern appeal to it as well.  It isn't as nice looking as some of the other brands which feature glass accents or other style points.  But I didn't buy a tv for how it looked when off.  I had a chance to play around with a few of the apps and they seemed to work well.  The most frustrating part about the process is probably using the slow remote to input your login / password information in the various apps.  I haven't had a chance to see if my wireless keyboard will work with the TV, if it does, that's a homerun.  The wifi connected rather easy, and held a solid 7.5 mbps connection.  This was better than the speed I get on my ps3 located beneath the tv.I haven't made up my mind regarding the soap opera effect.  Fortunately for those that hate it, the true motion technology can be easily switched off.  It also features 3 \"on\" levels of low, medium, and high.For available ports, there are plenty of HDMI connections, something a lot of the other mid price and budget tv's lack.  I use an older 5.1 home theater system and was less than excited when I realized there was no Digital Coaxial audio out on the TV.  If you plan to output a digital signal to an older receiver you will need an optical cable which can get expensive.  (I pass all of the audio from my devices through the TV and then to the receiver)  Ideally, you'd want an HDMI switching receiver and do it the right way.My favorite app on the TV is the Rhapsody app, something I haven't seen anywhere else.  It's nice to have an infinite music library in my living room without having to hook up my laptop or phone.  So far I'm very happy with the TV.

I feel like I'm shooting target practice trying to get even a delayed response from the TV. Vizio markets this is a \"smart\" TV with app functionality. In my personal experience, the apps were so slow, with so much lag, I couldn't enjoy using most of them. (I will say that the Netflix app works fine, but YouTube is especially bad.) One of the most unpleasant parts about this TV is the ear piercing, high-pitched whine it emits while turned off. This may not bother everyone.

Compared to my old Toshiba that it replaced, this TV is incredible. I am no video or audiophile but I was completely impressed right off the bat. Even though my STB only has 720p/1080i output (thanks for nothing Comcast, btw), the picture is stunning. No visible blocking or flicker, just perfect in my opinion. Love the 3D experience also. Never was a fan in the theater but on a smaller screen (55\" as small, Ha!) it looked great.I really only use my TV as a monitor so I have no comments on the sound. My audio system does that part too well to allow tiny TV speakers to have any action! I connect the TV to my system with the optical out connection. This is continually an issue. If I fast forward or skip while watching my DVR, occasionally the audio out from the tv stops working until I turn the tv off and wait 15-30 seconds. After it powers back on, the audio starts working again. Vizio tech support says it's my cable box, but the TV is the only thing new in my setup and it never happened with my other tv. Apparently, that situation isn't covered in the troubleshooting script they have over the phone so it has to be the cable box.My second issue with it is the \"Smart\" functioning. Wow, is that mis-named! Watching the installed apps (Netflix, Hulu, etc.) is easy and they look great. But where it falls down is in networking. It cannot reliably play video or music files from a DLNA server or networked computer. The TV will lock up until you hold the power button off and reset the TV if you try. Smart TV...It's like a fainting goat that just heard a loud noise when you try to network with it. There are no apps that allow connection to a phone or tablet even. If you want to watch only movies from the pay services or watch random web videos (which is fun until you run into a whack job with a camera), it does a fine job. This is not the Smart I thought TVs would be though.Now. That being said, I do still like the TV. It was almost an impulse buy, I called it a reflex buy because the price was so good.

The only flaw is the remote, It works when it wants to and most of the time I have to take the batteries out and place them back in to use it temporarily. Fortunately this is a none expensive fix with a simple remote swap. Overall I would highly recommend this TV if you are shopping in this price range.Update:  they do not sale compatible remotes for the 3D feature so I took it back and bought the LG LM7200 60\"....

I could barely plug in my hdmi cables because the cables were too long and too stiff to fit in the opening provided by the tv.A 3rd observation, is that the tv doesn't have any onboard buttons.If you're looking for a nice, small room tv, this should make your short list.

I really did believe the service tech when they assured me that all the kinks I had experienced with my first M-series were worked out. WRONG AGAIN. The TV has now began to freeze up. So much so that we have to unplug it completely. What a headache especially since it is mounted on the wall.

The best bang for the buck I could find when reading reviews was the Vizio M Series sets. Decided to step up to the 55' model. Wanted to pick it up from Amazon, but the only option they had available last weekend was another vendor charging $150 extra so picked it up at a local Sam's instead.It was a simple switch with the Samsung....just unplugged the components from the Samsung, set up the Vizio and plugged in the components. The overall size of the Vizio was actually pretty close to the size of the Samsung even though 9' inch bigger screen. The difference being that the screen on the Vizio is almost the entire size of the TV, while the Samsung had a large 'frame' around the screen. I've always loved the picture quality on the Samsung set and am similarly impressed with the PQ on the Vizio.I tried to view some 3D content via HDMI the first day to no avail. Didn't even show the option to switch to 3D from several sources. Did a chat with the Vizio support and their advice was to make sure I was using special 3D HDMI cables, which I knew was nonsense. However overnight after the first day there was a firmware update and the 3D option was now available on all sources. (Kind of crazy that you can't just push a button in the menu to do a firmware update instantly). A family member has a 3D set with active 3D and has to pay crazy amounts for the right glasses and keep them charged for use. The Vizio uses a passive 3D setup where all you need are the cheap 3D glasses like you get at the theater (our box had a set of 4 included). I pulled up some youtube 3D videos and was amazed at the quality of the 3D....its really incredible. Not sure how much 3D viewing we would ever do even with a 3D blu-ray player, but kind of makes me want to take advantage of the feature.Loved the easy access to the onboard apps, but won't use them much as we have a Roku and Apple TV attached through our sound system to the TV already with all the same streaming options. I know one new app coming to the TV is the 3DGO option for rental of 3D content, but its not being offered yet, but should be available soon I'm told.The only complaint I have about the set is the included remote. I found it very non-responsive even with a brand new set of alkaline batteries installed. I read that you can switch back and forth between a wifi and infrared signal and I tried, but still found it very sluggish. However I set up my URC R-40 to control the TV and I found the universal remote worked easily. Not sure why the problem with the Vizio remote, but it was a pain for sure.All in all, I think this set is a great value. 55\" thin LED, full built-in wifi, full array of streaming apps, great PQ all for around $1000.", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Preliminary Review Vizio M651d-A2R 65 inch 240Hz", "Author": "tombstonecowboy", "ReviewID": "R2HEEB3JZLRF6K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My purchase experience of this Television on Amazon was like most, if not all of my shopping experience with them--smooth and efficient. The delivery company, Pilot emailed me and set up a time for delivery; followed up by a phone call. The truck arrived exactly within that time window. The delivery people were professional and courteous. There was no evidence of damage to the shipping carton. The gentlemen unpacked the TV, bolted it to the stand and placed it where I asked. They also picked up ALL the pieces and removed the packing material such that after I tipped them for a job well-done and showed them the door it was as if they were never there. Needless to say twice, but here goes anyway--my particular experience with Pilot was top-notch.My very first impression after cabling it to my Satellite, Apple TV and Blu-Ray was disappointing. First) connecting it to my WiFi network wasn't as straight forward as I had hoped. WPS didn't work and apparently the internet-connectivity of the TV does not extend into the 5.0 GHz band. I was able to manually enter the SSID and security key and establish a connection, so far so good.Second) I'm experimenting with HD content from different sources just to get a 'feel' for my new set---I'm less than pleased. I tried a Blu-Ray disc [Gangster Squad] at first attempting to see how it performed with HQ content through a straight-wired HDMI input. The picture was so bad I initially believed the disc must have been hopelessly damaged in some way. (About now, I'm thinking 'I'm sending this puppy back) Third, I'm setting it up to watch some HD content from the Satellite source (again through a wired HDMI input and the picture just, flat out, looks all wrong for something I just spent a lot of money on. I'm tinkering with the picture settings accessed through the menu button and things aren't looking a whole lot better. Around this time, I turn the set off, grab a beer and commence some serious musing if I didn't just throw close to 2 LARGE down the toilet.Funny thing about this set; when I powered it up the second time I saw an information field that hinted it had just received TWENTY-NINE firmware updates and was in the midst of installing 26 of those 29. This gives me some optimism, especially since now the exact same Blu-Ray that wouldn't play hardly at all before was now---PERFECT. As were the HD content from the satellite.There is little discernible difference between streaming HD content via the Vizio built-in Netflix App or through the Apple TV Netflix App even though the Apple TV is dual band and seemingly the Vizio is not.Back to the TV itself; this bad boy has a SPLENDID picture with a couple caveats: the first being that the panel is a mirror. It reflects EVERYTHING, so I recommend for the best viewing experience to eliminate or subdue extraneous light as much as practical.We use the TV mainly for streaming movies, playing Blu-Ray discs, watching sports and the like. I'm going to make a comment on the 240Hz smooth motion feature of this set. When properly set up it works fairly well. While watching Miguel Cabrerra's home run leave the bat [mlb.com subscription, streamed through my WiFi rig] it was seamless. There are times when that type of fast-action isn't so smooth but that may be an artifact of streaming content, not necessarily a defect of the Vizio.Couple other points: the blacks on this TV are the deepest I've ever seen. The colors are vivid but not unnaturally so. All of this of course is absent a real calibration which a TV set of this quality must needs have at some point.I will follow up with a subsequent review after a while when the TV has been professionally calibrated and I have more experience with different content.Summing up:1) Apparently the Vizio gets its firmware upgrades when it's turned off--btw, they make A LOT of difference from the \"fresh-out-of-the-box\" experience.2) This TV is Bright, and I mean bright with a capital B.3) The panel reflects anything and everything, (you could shave in front of it if there was a sink in your viewing room.)Why do I give it 4 Stars? Because of the purchase and delivery experience AND because AFTER the firmware updates it turned into a BEAUTIFUL set. I am confident after I get it calibrated it will be everything I had hoped for.I highly recommend this set, especially if you're a sports fan and/or movie buff.Summation after having owned this set for a few months now: it's fine in every way; yes the panel is bright; yes, it's a mirror. No, it does NOT connect in the 5.0 Ghz band, and of course doesn't support the new ac wifi standard [although finding clients that do is not real easy--(yet) and the wifi throughput (2.4 Ghz) with my rig is 8.583 Mb/s through an unproxied connection. It streams all my Amazon content without any glitches, even the 1080p stuff. I don't use many, if any, of the apps this television supports. btw, I changed my ssids on my router and rediscovered that although this model is supposed to support WPS, mine doesn't. It would be more convenient if it did but if you're the type that never changes attributes on your router this is a minor problem as you will only need to enter your ssid and passphrase one time.As to the display, I LOVE the picture on this set--simple as that. I did not have it professionally calibrated because in my subsequent experience it really doesn't need it. It's perfectly beautiful just the way it is.In conclusion all I can advise is that if you're thinking of a Sony or Samsung (which I already own a Samsung for the master bedroom, don't waste the extra hundreds you're going to pay for the supposedly premium sets. This Vizio does everything I want and works flawlessly. imho, it's pointless to spend so much more to get a 'name'.I'm satisfied; I know it's a lot of money to spend but you won't be sorry. My only regret now is that I didn't buy the 70 inch set.One more thing, this television is VERY miserly on electricity, which is an attribute I hear the plasmas don't share.I hope you find this review helpful.", "Date": "June 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "good tv.", "Author": "bmac", "ReviewID": "RBB7BZTYNXBUF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros.

First thing that happened was the T.V would turn off on it's own. I immediately checked the sleep timer, it was on, after turning it off however the problem did not stop. The T.V would still turn off sporadically and the self timer was off. Soon after the remote seemed to stop working all together, now I say seemed because I don't know if it's the remote that malfunctioned or the T.V. What I do know is after much research online and a lot of troubleshooting the remote is still not doing anything. And yes, I've tried everything possible to make it work again.

The picture quality is decent, but not great. The sound was OK out of the TV speakers. The Remote is horrible. You have to line it up with the left corner of the TV or it will not work properly.I had the TV for 3 weeks and what was happening was that the audio of the TV when channels were changed would hang. If the last words of audio before you changed the channel on the Verizon Box was \"next week on...\" when you changed to the next channel you would see the video of the new channel but the audio would hang on next week on...next week on...next week on...for about 10 seconds. Once it stopped (the lag or hang) the video and audio on the new channel would not be in sync. The same would happen when watching the DVR; VOD- it did not matter. Once you went to any other video/audio it would hang. The work around was flipping to another channel quickly and then clicking back to the original channel. I thought it was the cables.  I changed out and put in new coaxial from the wall into the Verizon box and a new HDMI cable. ( it should be noted that it did this whether it was on HDMI 1-2 or 3 on the TV and there was no problem with HDMI in any input(1-2 or 3) with the Bluray player and my Roku 2; so it was clearly a FIOS/VIzio audio problem)After changing out the cables- there was no difference. I reset the verizon box- reset the router- RESET THE DARN TV to factory settings--same issue. I received a new verizon FIOS box...same issue. I took another TV from another room and hooked it up to the Verizon box--and No issue. I knew then it was the TV.There were some other minor annoyances. The TV is cheaply made. It looks cheap and the cuts in plastic in the back are barely large enough to get an HDMI cable in there.  I took it back to the store I bought it from and got a full refund and bought a 46\" Samsung LED. Just hooked it up and there are no problems.  Vizio is actually not a bad brand and I would have been OK with the cheap quality and OK picture because it was not as expensive as other models...but it did not work with HDMI and Verizon FIOS on the audio.  Some users have posted that the FIOS/Vizio audio HDMI problem has been acknowledged by Vizio in regards to audio drop outs (I just had the hanging problem) , and that there is a hidden menu in the FIOS box that can fix some issues- I could not find it on my box and the fact that I had to try was ridiculous- The brand new TV should work, particularly when I did not have a complicated set up.UPDATE: Forgot to mention two other problems: Top left hand corner had a dead pixel or something else that every now and then would dot the top of left of the screen and there were a couple channels with digital noise at the very top of the screen (all the way barely visible at the top of the screen. This \"noise strip\" was easily fixed by going into the TV settings and adjusting the screen by expanding a tad horizontally...My point for posting this is I should not have to do this if the screen resolution and setting are correct for my system.", "Date": "February 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "LOVE my New VIZIO 55-inch !!!", "Author": "Sue C.

My Molly Maids arrived to do their every-two-weeks cleaning of this rat-trap I live in ... and my 55-inch Vizio had been delivered the day before and had been left sitting still in the bottom portion of its shipping container.  I am home-bound after being invited to a attend a war held a number of years back ... and, long story only slightly longer, both my wife and I could NOT lift it to install the stand.  Well, the Molly's did their thing and then helped me lift.  Then it was a quick removal of the old 37-incher and put it on the couch ... then the new 55-inch Vizio into the hole in the homemade entertainment center (Early TreeHouse style).  I had the setup thing figured and after a bit of a few dammits-to-the-15th-power-of-oh-hells, I got it sorted out.  First thing was the insertion of \"John Carter\" in 3-D.  My wife had never seen 3-D before and my last experience was in 1953!  She is thoroughly HOOKED.  We have \"I-Robot\" in there now ... 3-D of course!Well ... the TV is 1080p and it shows!  The size of the screen in this room is more in angular measure than I'd see in a theater.  And no headaches !!!  That is one thing I remember about the old 3-D movies.  A skull-splitting headache!  Not this time.The John Carter movie involved the black bars above and below but the black was so black that, in the dark, you didn't realize they were there.  The \"I-Robot\" movie fills the screen but the format of the 55-inch screen means no cut-off portions ... and the picture is large enough to lietrally INVOLVE the both of us.  Duck!  Here comes another one !I was so concerned after the bad beginning to this trip but all's well that ends in spectacular fashion !!!Buy this TV !  I would have bought an even bigger screened Vizio but It wouldn't fit !!!Heck !!!  BUY TWO !!! you need one in the bedroom, too !  The price is right!

I do have a LG 42\"  LCD TV since 2009 and I never face any problem with remote. But I purchased this on January 7th, received 5 days later and it was ok. I could manage the picture quality as I want, I upgraded the sound by buying a 42\" sound bar with wireless subwoofer from Vizio too. I was very happy, everything was working well.3 days ago the remote stopes to respond, the V button and 3D button doesn't work, the other buttons that I use are working well, without V button I can't see even the content in USB devices, just for not speak about smart apps. It's very sad to have a smart TV without smart functions.I talked with Vizio via chat and the representative told me to do a couple of thing that I already trained by searching for help on YouTube. I did everything more than twice but nothing as changed. Finally he told me to buy another remote. Ok, that's it... I can't blame the costumer service, the problem is in the quality of the equipment, I could not believe that VIZIO is an American brand, normally genuine American brands are good.First of all, just see the TV design and compare it against the remote Design, there's a huge difference, a friend of mine has same size samsung and it comes with two remotes and their are amazing, even my old LG has most beautiful remote.The tv is still working, but without whole functions, and the only way I do have to solve it is by ordering an universal remote. I do have other idea, I will put it in the office a scum putter monitor and buy samsung or LG smart tv, with gesture and voice commands, I know that will be more satisfied than I'm right now.If you want my advice, just don't buy, simple like that, do not buy it. Search for other brands, is batter to spend $200 in addition and get something that really worth.Vizio has serious problem with theirs remote, sound bar remote is the same, very old concept, it has a display but you can't see anything in the dark, thing that I can't understand because the adds says that it is to give your living room a theatrical environment.

My b/f was determined to get nothing but another Sony but financial constraints put the kybosh to that. We saw this model on sale and on display. I was impressed right off and it had everything I wanted...smart tv, 240 HZ, 3D capable. So we happily bought it. Was easy to set up and after we got an HD cable box, WOW...what a picture. Fabulous...couldn't ask for more, especially for the price.I never saw 3D on a tv until now. I was watching a program and there was a bird flying toward the camera and I actually JUMPED because I thought it was going to hit me. Amazing.I had no problems at all with the remote. And now, with the cable remote, I only need the Vizio remote to change the tv settings.The sound is not the greatest but we have a stereo unit we plan to hook up soon so that wont be an issue.The reason I gave it 4 stars is that, for some reason, I cant connect the WiFi properly. The unit tells me its connected but no data is being received. I've tried turning the router on and off, fooling with the IP address but nothing seems to help. This is frustrating, since I can't use the apps without the WiFi. But, for the moment, I am totally in love with the picture and if I can get the WiFi going, I will upgrade my review. But for picture quality and price, I doubt we could have done better.P.S. Check out the CNet Forums for calibration numbers for this tv.Update 2/18 - I wasn't able to get the TV to connect to WiFi. So I did the next best thing. I moved the modem and router out to the living room and used an Ethernet cable to connect directly. No problems now.

Far better than that of Sony KDL70R520A  A Vizio skeptic no more...", "Author": "JDC \"DiverSTJ\"", "ReviewID": "R2FCFL5VG909PJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My goal was to upgrade to a 70\" from my Panasonic VIERA TC-P55ST50 55-Inch while maintaining the same or nearly identical picture quality.  The Panasonic plasma is well known to essentially provide the best picture available anywhere.  However, I really wanted a 70\" screen and the largest Panny plasma available is only 65\" so I had to find another option.I was very hesitant to order a Vizio product.  I assumed that quality would likely be inferior because Vizio was not a \"Top High-End Brand\".  Originally I ordered a Sony KDL70R520A 70-Inch and to say I was disappointed in the picture quality / color reproduction is an understatement.  I tried calibrating the Sony and it was simply an inferior product based on my personal experience.  I returned the Sony to Amazon.  Amazon was exceptionally easy to deal with regarding the return, which for a 70\" TV is no small undertaking.  It is an expensive proposition to accept a return on an item this big and this expensive.  It now has to be sold as refurbished, I assume.  Return shipping is a costly proposition as well but there was no charge!  For this alone I will remain a loyal Amazon customer.The M-Class Vizio received good reviews so I decided to give it a try before conceding defeat and resorting to the 65\" Panasonic plasma for no reason other than a lack of 70\" options with a top quality picture.  I am very glad I gave the Vizio a chance!!  The picture quality was far better than that of the Sony and the HDMI ports on the Vizio are better executed as well.  The ARC HDMI port on the Sony required the plug to be connected perpendicular to the back of the set which interfered with low-profile wall mounting.  The Vizio ARC port allowed for the plug to be parallel to the wall and therefore did not interfere with a nearly flush wall mount.I am pleased to be able to give the Vizio M701d-A3R a positive review as a good solid contender who's picture quality far exceeds that of the 70\" Sony.  I did decide to purchase an extended service plan from Square Trade just to cover myself in case there are any long-term quality issues with the Vizio.", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "No price match?", "Author": "D.

They only had the 55\" model on display but it was enough for me to get a general idea of what I was going to be getting.When I received this television, I was impressed by it's large screen and extremely small bezel. It's only a little over an inch thick too, so it looks great on the wall.In regards to picture quality, you pretty much get what you pay for. As many others have pointed out in their reviews here, this television definitely suffers from severe light bleed around the edges of display due to the backlight. Turning off dynamic backlighting helps but then the black levels just sort of seem washed out. The up side is that you only really notice the light bleed when there are really dark scenes with bright objects in them (like a lightbulb). Aside from that, the colors are rich and vibrant and everything is crystal clear. Pretty impressive for a television at this price point.The smart TV options are pretty useful. I use the Netflix and Amazon Instant Video apps all the time and they are always in stunning HD. I would recommend connecting the TV via ethernet instead of WiFi if you're looking for the picture quality when streaming to always be it's best.Bottom line: If you're looking for a big, stylish and affordable television, this is the one for you.

Sucks when your 20 minutes into a show and have to start over. Hopefully they will fix the apps. Also, just note that it takes a minute to boot up.

I didn't even tell the Rep. what had transpired that morning the the cable tech. Picture is just as good with component setup, but one little cable is easier to work with than five.

The setup was pretty easy Tivo-HDMI 2 slot, PS3-HDMI 3 slot, Samsung Sound Bar-HDMI 1 (ARC) slot. At first I had some issues getting the sound to come through the sound bar. But after setup. I shut the everything off. Unplugged, then replugged everything, WAALAAH!! Everything synced like it was supposed to (even the remotes, but more on that later). Before the purchase, I was not looking for a 3D TV. I wanted a Smart TV, with at least 120Hz. When the sales guy told me they had a TV in my price range with 240Hz, I was shocked. Saw it on display, right next to the Sony 4K television and to be perfectly honest, it held it's own.The setup took about 20-25 minutes, the remote was hit or miss, there's no keyboard, so it was one letter pressing for registering, syncing to wifi and labeling inputs.  The remote was almost unbearable but I have a TIVO remote that I use, so I knew I wasn't going to rely on it in the future. The TV updated itself last night, seems that the remote is more responsive, in case many are holding out on a universal remote.There are many choices to set the picture, I just left it on Game Mode, but it does seem to adjust on its own.You will definitely need a sound bar or surround setup with this TV. The speakers are weak, but should be somewhat expected with the small bezel and frame. I thought I would have issues with glare, but I watched a 3D movie in a sunlit room and the picture was perfect.For those that wonder why I chose a Samsung Soundbar instead of Vizio, I really just liked the look. Its connected via HDMI cord and syncs with everything. The TIVO Remote automatically synced with the soundbar as well. Of course there are not as many options on the TIVO remote, but power on, off, changing channels, inputs, and volume all work with the TV remote. Everything shuts off when one click of the button, and everything shuts on with one click. Today, I got a 3D movie in the mail. Turned on the PS3 via the on switch, the TV and Soundbar automatically came on!!! I was shocked!! The TV recognized that the PS3 had powered on and automatically switched inputs to show the PS3 Homescreen. I know it's a smart TV but didn't know it was that smart!!AppsThere are plenty of apps on the TV, so far I've only used the YouTube app, which streamed perfectly. I have most of the apps already on TIVO, but the TV apps seem to be a little faster in processing. I'll update later when I try more apps.The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the setup can be a little tedious and I'll admit I got frustrated getting the soundbar to sync with the TV at first. If the remote had a keyboard this would definitely get 5 stars, hopefully, next year's model will have one.", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great deal on good product", "Author": "to2911", "ReviewID": "R3DB6TYLUIFW7R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was able to purchase this from seller called Pinnacle for about $350, due I think to a broken tab on the base that isn't even visible when assembled, nor effects the set or even base in any meaningful way. I had chosen this TV after a number of trips to a few Costco locations, where I planned to join and purchase after a cross country move. Looking at many screens at once, and comparing features, led me to evaluate this unit as not only the best deal, but superior to more expensive sets of similar size. I found the process of joining Costco such an incredible hassle, and they were so obnoxious (treating me as if I had no other options in the world to buy anything), that I check Amazon and found this deal - 35% off Costco's price, not to mention the fee to join.The picture is great, the design sleek and unobtrusive. I find it comparable if not better to a friend's set, who paid $1200 three years ago for a 42\".My only complaint is that the remote is a bit poorly designed and glitchy, and the set up was a little problematic (TV wouldn't recognize axial cable hook up and had to go with an old composite cord.)

When comparing this TV to other more expensive brands in-person at the store I was a little skeptical because they obviously did not have the TV calibrated to the best potential settings. The price was too good to pass up, so I bought it anyway. Setup was very easy, took less than 3 minutes. The picture is OK out of the box, but after I tweaked the settings to my liking the picture was AMAZING. I could not believe the quality of image for a $1000 TV. The 240 HZ looks great with sports and live programming, and movies looks amazing. I was watching \"Prometheus\" the other day in HD on HBO and I couldn't take my eyes off it, it looked absolutely beautiful. Haven't got into the Smart functions much yet, but my experience so far has been fine. The design of the TV looks great- very thin bezel and the TV is not very heavy. It looks kind of small out of the box because the bezel is so thin, but once it is on the TV is a beast.So far no technical problems (the remote works flawlessly for me). If you are on the fence with this TV or are looking at a more expensive brand, I highly recommend purchasing this TV or at least giving it a second look. The value for this TV is great and with all the tech features built in and quality of picture I plan on having this TV for many years. I got the 2 year extended warranty just in case.

The unit has no physical buttons and can only be operated via the remote... and that thing must've been designed by a 5 year old out of play-doh with snap-on fun circuits! It is completely unreliable and needs to be pointed/angled to get any response from the TV, circa 1974, not 2014!I have failed to find an option to upgrade the hideously counter-intuitive apps like the Amazon one, or any other that are bundled! There seems to be no option to upgrade system firmware! The apps crash frequently enough and render the TV unresponsive and turns it into a huge thing on the wall that kinda reflects things... So, its not even a good mirror!!I did a lot of searching beforehand and read complaints mostly about the remote being trash.

The procedure gives you the option of programming the Vizio remote to mimic the cable box programming.  I have Comcast and it did a great job getting itself to look like a Comcast remote.  However, the documentation refers to the default settings on the remote.  For instance, my remote's \"menu\" feature now brings up the Comcast menu, NOT the Vizio menu.

It is also poor on my other Vizio TV as it only takes a small ribbon on the side of the TV and is very difficult to navigate and see what you are picking.  Apps on other TVs or systems, PS*, Xbox 360/One, etc are much, much better.  Netflix works good and the app has been updated to be in line with other systems.However, now that the apps are all there the internet drops and locks up the applications all the time.  You cannot finish a movie or even a show.  I have no issues with my PS3, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Wii, etc with this.  I also do not have this problem with my older Vizio TV.....  So it is something with this model and/or network card....Also, I need to continue to play with the different HDMI inputs but when using the DirecTV receiver the screen coloration flickers when turning it on almost like it is trying to find the right color system/scheme.

I'm updating it again to address growing issues that I'm having with the TV.After quite a bit of research, I decided on the Vizio M-Series 40\" TV. When I initial received it, I loved it. Over the past month and a half, my satisfaction with this television has really bottomed out. I started out by giving it a 4-star review, which I then revised down to 3-stars. I've now revised down to 2-stars.The positives:The TV itself is gorgeous. The picture is crisp and the colors pop. The audio provides plenty of power to fill a living room without need of extra speakers. I also commend Vizio on their extremely intuitive settings features. I haven't owned a TV in the better part of a decade, so it's possible that I've just missed out on this, but this TV really does feel very \"smart\". The settings are easily navigated, and I was able to connect effortlessly to my wireless network the first time. The settings and context menus are fantastic.I should note here that I don't receive cable TV. I get all of my programming through Netflix and Amazon Prime, in addition to HDMI connection to a computer. So I can't review the TV's performance with cable TV.The negatives:The \"Smart Apps\" are problematic, and their performance is sluggish. I use the Netflix app daily. It has, over the past month and a half, become more and more frustrating to use. It has trouble connecting, and sometimes simply won't boot up.Another problem is the remote control. The remote itself is beautiful and well-designed. But, unfortunately, there seems to be a very limited range in which the remote actually communicates with the TV. With most remotes, you can simply point the remote in the general direction of the TV and they'll communicate. This remote, however, needs to be pointed EXACTLY at the TV in order to command it. It's inconvenient, and the main reason that I (initially) ranked this TV a 4, and not 5.If VIZIO (and/or) Netflix fixes the app, I'll be happy to bump the rating back up.At this point, I can't honestly recommend the TV to anyone, since I'm more often frustrated than not with it.

I'm really in love with the VIZIO 40-Inch 1080p Smart LED HDTV because it meets an outstanding value in terms of features when compared to price.First things first, the TV has amazing aesthetics.  The Vizio features a super slim bezel, that means I'm looking at more TV space and less plastic surround.  1080P in this price range is not too easy to find so another score there.  Much better 120Hz refresh rate, my old one had only 60Hz.  LED is fantastic, and energy saving, much more vibrant than LCD too.  Love the 10,000,000:1 contrast, a tremendous upgrade to 10,000:1 dynamic my older model used.Getting into the users experience, the Vizio 40\" is a good size for the bedroom, office, or smaller living room.  Love the built-in Wi-Fi for connectivity to all the apps in the Vizio store.  I wish this model had a built-in web browser, but I have a tablet that is great for that.  If you use and subscribe to Netflix, the TV remote has a dedicated button directly to the service.  In terms of connectivity, you have 3 HDMI ports for your gaming stations, DVD/Blu-Ray player, sound system or whatever else you may use.The picture quality is really amazing; clear, crisp and wonderful.  Sound is really good, the 2 10W speakers are powerful and full sounding.  This TV gives new meaning to entertainment center.

This TV quality fits perfect for dark, night time television watching in the bedroom.  The only issue that I had with it was the first one we got had bad pixels in the top right corner, maybe 10-12 that were bad so I returned it.  Returning these are pretty seemless, pack it up and wait for UPS to pick it up.  Enter TV #2.  Set it up, this time it had 2 dead pixels in the bottom of it spaced out.  I am a bit of an electronic OCD so I returned it again for bad pixels.  Enter TV #3, this time special case workers were on it, sent me one out the next day and I plugged it in.  This time, a single dead pixel in the top left.  At this point I am sick of returning TV's, unplugging, packaging.  Due to it being a smart TV, can't just plug it in and test the dead pixels.  I have a month to decide whether or not to return again or just deal with it.  I am almost afraid of returning it and getting more dead pixels than the single one that is dead in tv #3.

Movies can look like HIGH DEF videos youd  personally take with a high def digital camera and play on your TV.Some people might not like this but I do not have a big problem with it though I wished there was an option to shut this off if you wanted to.The 3D is superb and there are many movies on HBO and NETFLIX in 3D but a 3D bluray will show the TV at its best and capable of!The TV updates firmware by it self so your remote should not have the \"point to the left corner problem\" I had early on.The smart aspect of the TV is also great and convenient though I feel the remote should have had a keyboard on the back like previous models.Overall feels like it is built well and I would highly recommend this TV over other brands.VIZIO REALLY NEEDS TO MAKE AN APP FOR THEIR TVS SO PEOPLE CAN USE THEIR PHONES OR TABLETS WITH THE TV!STEP IT UP VIZIO LETS GO!!!!!!GREAT BUY I am very happy to date I hope it lasts as long as other HD tvs I have ownedIf youre on the fence about it and waiting around I would just buy it you wont be disappointed!", "Date": "March 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "E. DeLapp", "ReviewID": "R1VL15YBXRYANV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Note: This review pertains to the 60 inch model.Pros:-Great picture. Color balance needed some adjustments, but once done it looks great. Excellent brightness, good darks; motion is natural-looking; \"smooth motion effect\" can be turned on or off; local \"smart\" dimming is a big plus.-Passive 3D looks good. I prefer passive 3D over active 3D because I find it less irritating to my eyes, and I like being able to host multiple viewers without having to purchase expensive glasses. It's worth noting that the resolution of passive 3D is noticeably worse than active 3D, but a 3D Blu-ray is still miles ahead of any DVD.-Smart TV functions are fine. I haven't used many of them, but the Netflix & YouTube apps are intuitive and function well.-Extremely thin bezel, which is important if you're trying to fit the screen into a limited space.-With latest firmware update, remote operates via bluetooth, which is a great improvement. Remote is also backlit.-Satisfactory inputs. Plenty of HDMI inputs, which are the only ones that matter these days.Cons:-In dark room viewing situations, there is some edge light bleeding during scenes in which the edges of the frame are dark and the center is bright. It's particularly noticeable during credit rolls, which doesn't particularly bother me, but it's definitely an issue.-Glossy screen is highly reflective. This could be an issue in rooms with lots of windows.-No Qwerty keyboard on remote, which is only an issue if you use the apps.-The Amazon Prime app crashes every time I open it (I just use my PS3 instead).-TV stand does not swivel. Not a big deal unless you need to rotate the screen often.-No PIP function. I find myself hoping they change this via firmware update, but I haven't heard anything.I have not commented on the TV's sound because I use a separate sound system and have always kept the TV speakers off. I imagine most people purchasing a 60 inch TV have their own sound system.Overall I've been perfectly happy with this screen, especially given its modest price. The image looks very natural, colors are well-saturated, and the smart dimming really helps with the contrast. The biggest con for me is the edge bleeding, though it's  noticeable in very few scenes (mostly credits) and only in a dark ambient environment, so it's not that much of an issue. Since my home theater is in the basement, the reflectivity of the screen is not a problem for me, but it could be an issue for some people.

This one has lived up to its reviews and I am 100% pleased with the operation, style, ease of use, all of it.  One thing that some said were concerned about was the glossy screen and reflections.  This was my biggest concern.  We just added a 3 season room with LOTS of windows and this TV was for this room so I was concerned with the glare possibility.  First yes there is some glare when the sun is shinning in but it was minimal and now is basically not existent.  I have the TV mounted to the wall and with the mounting bracket I turned the TV just slightly up towards the ceiling.  Now I can only see glare off the ceiling when the TV is OFF.  So a little hint, if you get glare just a slight upward turn should greatly reduce the glare.  Unless you have mirrors on the ceiling :).  Otherwise the setup and was a breeze.

We found that in this TV. We are glad we kept our old big box TV'S until the prices on flat screens came down and the quality improved. Vizio makes a great TV.

The quality of the picture in comparison to slightly less expensive to equivalently priced models is good. Very little light bleed around the edges. Good color representation and the TV has solid black when configured. I am not a videophile so it is normally not easy for me to notice these things unless compared with other screens. Now, when I have passed the electronics section in large stores I can easily see why cheaper panels are cheaper. I noticed this screen has a tendency to pick up glare moreso than others so this should be taken into account when considering where a screen is to be placed.Build quality feels pretty amazing especially when compared to a much older and bulkier flat screen. When mounting the TV the edges feel surprisingly solid and the glass screen is nice. I don't plan on taking it with me anywhere or even touching it again for a while so this is not a large consideration.The remote is a mostly good experience. It is supposed to control the TV by RF transmission but feels very direction sensitive. The remote does not work well unless pointed directly at the TV. The remote is backlit which is a really nice feature especially when turning off lights in an attempt to escape glare. The ease in which the TV assists in programing the remote for other devices which may be in an entertainment unit is great. For example, in the control panel I told the TV I want to use an external receiver. The TV then asks what make and model. Once completed it walks the user through a process of testing codes to control the receiver from the TV remote. It was a quick process which I could easily reproduce without looking for a manual.The worst thing about the TV is the use of Yahoo apps. While I really appreciate the capability of the smart TV feature the Yahoo apps used to stream things like Amazon Instant and Netflix feels really sluggish. Further, the Amazon Instant app only uses aproximately a third of the screen without an option to change it. Browsing movies or shows feels slow on a connection which easily facilitates HD streaming. Browsing is further hampered by a limited number of browsing options (no categories, tags, suggestions or capability to access your watch list) and an occational tendency to lock up if pages are shuffled too quickly too long.Yahoo apps isn't a deal killer however as it does work. Once the movie starts however playback is smooth. Control of the stream is easy to pause, fast forward or rewind. Other apps like Pandora or YouTube work pretty well. I have also noticed the media playback function appears to play more than what is claimed to be supported.There are a few other models I saw sold by local stores like Target for less. I looked at the features like 3D and thougt they were frivelous options which drive to price of the TV up. But, in comparison the quality of the TV picture quality really shine which makes the additional cost worth it. Bottom line, if you are not willing to spend 2,500-3,000 on a high end LED TV go for this one.", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV!", "Author": "Gabe Lindsay", "ReviewID": "R37FJEIFI7UW6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ordered this TV as a gift to myself after years of research.

I have heard good things about Vizio and thought for the price I would give them a shot.Pros: Sleek, elegant design with a slim frame. Nice selection of apps (though for me they are pointless with most apps available on the devices I use) Color is also excellent.Cons: Refresh rate is not a true 120hz and also not very \"effective.\" Picture quality on games looks okay but watching TV or Blu Ray movies the picture quality quickly degrades. Images were grainy and not very defined. I used a variety of calibration settings I found on the internet but while I could minimize the pixelation it still never looked great or even good. Looking at a 720p picture on another TV in the house a LG Plasma it wasn't even close in terms of quality. When I went to the store to look at the model on display I was informed by Best Buy Magnolia associates that this is a common complaint for Vizio and this model in particular.Summary: If picture quality is not the most important factor in buying a new TV and form factor and appearance is, this set may be for you.

I don't have the soap opera effect and the colors are very bright.The Design: This is a very low profile TV with a very sleak silver frame. I mounted mine on the way with a low profile mount and it look very stylish and blends right in.The Smart TV Features: I've used other smart tvs before and found them to be very clunky. The Vizio is a very simple set-up to watch Amazon Prime or Netflix, in fact the remote has a button for each. Instead of bringing up a giant screen and taking away the TV picture, it just pops out on the left hand side like a menu. You can browse through the selection while still watching the TV program you were watching in the background. It so simple to use I no longer feel I need the AppleTV I've needed with other smartTVs saving me $90+.My only regret is that I didn't buy a bigger screen! I'll probably be purchasing the 65\" in the near future to replace my older 65\".After this TV I'm now a vizio convert.

I just wanted a nice TV for family to watch shows like Modern Family, Propery Brothers and the occassional movie.  I replaced a 4 year old 46\" Samsung TV that was very well rated by CR.  The Vizio picture is noticable better.As noted in other reviews, there is some glare but not enough for me to return TV.  My installation is worst case scenario for creating glare/reflections with a 20' wall of South-facing windows opposite the TV.  There is more glare because the TV is so huge, but not that much different than the semi-matte Samsung.I had hoped to just use the TV without any supplemental sound (like I did on the Samsung).  The speakers point backwards so volume needs to be very high to listen.  It quickly gets just noisey and overall sucks.  Gave me a good reason to spring for the 5.1 Vizio sound bar.  I think that it is a great value, especially with the wireless sub and surround speakers (connected just to the sub).  TV stand doesn't work very well when you use a soundbar.  The Vizio bar is about 3\" high and covers the bottom 1\" of the TV sitting in front of it.  Huge TV, so not losing much on bottom of screen, just annoying.  Bose has a nice, skinny soundbar but that was outside my budget.I currently live out of town with best option for internet is Dish-Net, so I'm not able to enjoy the \"smart\" part of the TV until I move.I was worried about the TV being too big for space, especially compared to the 46\".

For that price I'm trying my absolute hardest to like & keep this TV.  I bought it because my 26\" Vizio was just a tad small for playing my PS3 games (I was always having trouble reading the in-game text...why do they make it so small!?).  To be honest, the 26\" had a better picture & viewing angles than this thing does.  This TV's picture quality degrades substantially when you move just a couple feet to either side.  Not a deal killer for me, as I'm usually the only one viewing it--and from head-on.  My other gripe with this thing is the remote.  My God, who engineered this TV so that you have to point the remote DIRECTLY at the television or else it won't work?  I'm constantly having to fight with the stupid thing to get it to register.  Awful.  Truly awful.  I read somewhere that the remote can use your home's wifi signal so that it doesn't have to be pointed directly at the TV, but I've not found any instructions on how to set that up (assuming it's even true).  The remote itself is nice, but the fussiness of its censor is an absolute abomination.  One degree off and your command won't register.I also had an incident the first day I set this thing up where the TV kept shutting itself off repeatedly for no apparent reason when I had both my DVR and PS3 on at the same time.  I have no clue what that was all about and so far I've not been able to recreate it, so perhaps (and hopefully) it was just a fluke.  For the price I paid I REALLY want to like this TV, but part of me wants to just go back to squinting and using my 26\".UPDATE: Just tried watching YouTube vids via this TV...what a useless mess.  Don't bother!  It kept freezing, only for the TV to eventually turn itself off for no apparent reason.

No screen deformities and I don't see any edge lighting that's overriding or even remotely bothersome.Then there's the 3D! People love to hate the glasses. Well I adore 3D and this tv offers the best kind in \"passive\" form meaning the tv does all the work not the glasses. My old Mits (2009) used \"active\" glasses that are much heavier and had sinc issues that, after 2 years, stopped me from watching 3D altogether. However I did continue buying 3D movies anyway in anticipation of this very day! The much hated glasses weigh practically nothing and there's no headache or fatigue to speak of. I have a large stack of 3D movies and now I can watch them with ease. I really like this tv...I do have one small gripe. The remote is a problem! You'll have to be patient when pressing buttons and eventually you'll get what you want. Very annoying.

Then the decision had to which model and size. Although a 40\" was a good buy also, I considered where it would be positioned, and a wall was out of the question, I have too many pictures that need their own space so I opted for the 32\". Next was the Hz, which is really important when you move up the pixel ladder. 60Hz is okay for the 700p's, but not so good for the 1080p's, and the Smart TV addition sealed the deal, except for one thing; they were sold out! Well at least the new ones were. So I began looking at the used ones, which are returns, or with slight imperfections, and cheaper. Who cares if the base has a scratch, put some magic marker on it, or just wait a few months (especially if you have kids) and you will have your own marks. Mine just had a raggedy looking box that it was being shipped in (that box is now at the recycling center). I saved about $30 dollars, even after paying the shipping charges, another benefit!Television was easy to assembly, just a simple stand and 8 screws. Hooking up coax cable and video/audio plugs was a no-brainier, and programming involved just following the on-screen instructions. Picture quality and performance is great, sound is pretty good too; but I might opt for a sound bar later, for that depth while watching action movies.

The only negative as others have mentioned is the remote not always being the easiest to get it do what you want. You really have to aim it directly at the TV whereas most other remotes I've had worked as long as you aimed it in the general direction of the TV or merely forward. Another negative (but not a big deal) is getting the HDMI and power cord into the TV. Because the TV is so slim, you push all the cords into the TV vertically instead of what I'm used to pushing it straight in from the back to the front. It might have just been me and it only took a few extra seconds each and might be easier if the TV is laying flat on a surface if possible.Now on to the positives. The picture is amazing! So is the 3D. I really wanted passive 3D because I didn't want bigger heavier glasses that I had to worry about charging and were more expensive to buy. This TV comes with eight pairs of glasses so you'll have enough for a small gathering and can buy more cheap if need be. I also don't have to worry about compatibility issues either. I've only had one HDTV myself to compare it so and it's an older model from six years or so. So obviously almost any current model HDTV will look better. However, some friends and family members have newer TVs and I'd say that this looks as good if not better than any of theirs. None of them have 3D TVs though so I can only compare it to what I've seen in the stores and that's not always the best representation. Regardless, I think this TV's 3D is fantastic especially for the price.

The picture quality is beautiful and the 3D functions just as well as an in-theater experience. The only two issues I have are, as with other comments, the remote control is better suited as a paper weight. It's coverage is very unacceptable and operates in a very small corridor of site to the TV. I was able to program my universal remote, which has MUCH better range, so this is a moot point for my system. Others may want to be aware of it however.The other issue is that the TV, apparently by default, disables the TV's closed captioning function when connected by HDMI or A/V cables. The other units in my network have their own CC so the function is still available but I would prefer to have a universal CC style for all components rather than a different format for each component.Again, the picture quality, functionality, and ease of setup I thought deserved a five star rating and, had it not been for the remote's poor quality and the lack of allowing the user to decide if they wanted a universal TV controlled CC option, this review WOULD have garnered a 5 star rating.If any issues come up in the future, I will note them.***Update 1/9/2014***Since the first day, I have had an issue with the remote control shutting down at random times. It can go for several hours or a few seconds but the remote shuts down as much as 10+ times per day. Resetting the remote by removing a battery and reinserting brings it back up for a time but the problem has been a daily issue since the day it was activated.

Given the prices of these tvs and the low quality in lower priced models you can't beat this deal. The picture quality is fantastic, vivid and colorful but it needs tweaking out of the box. The presets are not very good. The 3d is awesome I couldn't see any problems. The picture was clear and I felt like It was taking place right in my living room. I did experience some light bleed on one side or another a couple of times but that doesn't bother me. It didn't  interfere with the scene and it only occurred once or twice over several days of viewing. The picture is super vivid HD with enhanced motion capabilities which cause detailed scenes to continue in clear detail even under fast motion. This takes getting used to because most folks are not used to this kind of quality. This function can be turned off. The netflix app was pretty good, much better than our roku box and faster as well as it allowed for super HD quality and one 3d movie (only one I could find). I have basic high speed internet ( 6 to 12 mbs) and I could watch 3d and super HD netflix no problems.  The 2 USB ports allows you to view pictures, video etc. my Nikon camera 1080p recorded movies played back with exceptional quality no glitches. The sound is exceptional, probably the best feature of all. Most HD tvs lack in sound but this one is excellent. This set replaces a much beloved 55 inch sharp Lcd with great picture quality as well but still doesn't come too close to catching this vizio model. Sharps are brighter tvs and the vizio is a little darker but still a better tv. The comparable Sharp to replace my model was about 500 dollars more. All in all if you're looking for an affordable tv with better than average quality, excellent 3d and sound then this might do you well. Other models priced much higher...closer to 2000 dollars would give a similar experience but without the issues of bleeding and color tweaking issues possibly. It's a solid deal for the price because what it might lack in some ways it far out does higher priced tvs in other ways.

I was worried that the text wasn't going to be as clear but its the same as any other LCD Monitor.  Using it for the computer there's no complaints.  I did have to Reduce Sharpness on the TV so text can be clear.  You can also go to the Display settings on your computer if you want the text to be bigger.  There is no VGA port so your computer has to have an HDMI or DVI and you can get a DVI-HDMI Cable.  Second playing games looks amazing and haven't had any lag so far.  The Screen is Simi-Glossy so I guess that's what makes the color vibrant.  I would say the sound is loud enough and clear and will suffice until I can get a sound-bar.  Third the app convenience on the TV allows me to have the computer off while using Netflix, Amazon Instant Video or Youtube.Cons- Control does not respond at times or at least you have to point the control to the bottom left corner for it to work well.- No Tilt Capabilities.

The 3D looks just like it does at the theatre, and Avatar, Jurassic Park and Finding Nemo all look amazing in 3D.

The reason I give it 3 stars is because it is a large display at a decent price point, and if you can get over the dark screen light bleeding, the picture quality is very good.  I have read, tweaked, and calibrated for a few weeks now trying to get rid of the light bleeding.  The only way I've found to eliminate it, is to turn down the backlight and brightness settings to the point that the picture becomes dull and dark.  Alternately, you can tweak the settings so that the bleeding is dispersed throughout the entire screen, which makes it less noticeable, but in doing this you lose true blacks - the background becomes a dark grey rather than a black, which creates a washout effect and takes away from the picture quality.  I have an old fluorescent LCD TV that I bought in 2006 that does not have this light bleeding issue.  In fact, I didn't know what light bleeding was until I bought this Vizio TV.  The bleeding is only noticeable when there's a bright image against a black background, and it emanates from the edges of the TV (quite annoying).  It's most noticeable at the beginning and end of a movie when the credits are scrolling, in the 'black' bars when video that doesn't take up the entire screen is playing, between commercials when the entire screen is 'black' (or supposed to be black).  From what I've read lately, this is a common issue with LED LCD edge lit displays.

My first impression is wow!  Great picture, great design.  I still don't know how they are selling this TV (50in 1080p 240hz) at the same price that they are selling the same model at 120hz.  My only thought is that they are now competing with Samsung and LG to work into the higher end market.  In comparison to LG and Samsung, the cost savings is significant.  Walking through Best Buy and searching for hours online at similarly spec'ed TVs I found that most are double the cost.  I could not find a better price than Amazon.  I have not properly calibrated the picture yet, but it is very good out of the box.  The menus are easy to navigate and the pictures looks as good as its competition AT HALF THE COST.

Brattoli", "ReviewID": "R1KDB6GBV5DRB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The M-Series is the flagship of the Vizio fleet of TVs. I spent a lot of time trying to decide between the M551d-A2R 55-Inch 1080p 240Hz 3D Smart LED HDTV and the \"step down\" model E500d-A0 50-Inch 1080p 120Hz 3D Smart LED HDTV. The E-Series TV is a very good tv, and my decision to choose the M series was not driven by the difference in screen size. Rather, I was torn between the matte screen versus the glossy screen. My prior tv had a matte screen and so had no \"mirror\" effect or harsh glare. I also presently use a dual screen setup for my computer. My desktop monitor has a matte finish versus the glossy finish of my laptop's monitor, so I deal with the differences directly every day.After actually seeing the M551d I have to say I was sold. Yeah, the screen is glossy but there are workarounds to cut down on the reflections such as positioning of lighting of in the room and the use of bypass lighting when viewing in a dark room.The picture on this tv is GORGEOUS. There's no other way to put it. I am a real stickler when it comes to getting true color on my tvs, and I tweak color settings for a considerable period until I'm happy. I don't watch a lot of TV, but I do watch a lot of movies. I have a huge collection, and the picture simply has to be right.I have to say, out of the box this TV was a challenge in that area. The factory settings look great out of the box, but after a while you notice the little annoyances. For instance, the sharpness is WAY too high. This has a real impact when viewing live indoor sports events. You can see noticeable artifacting around players in motion. I finally went to the internet to search for professional color settings for this TV. After using the settings recommended in the CNET Forum (just Google the TV model number and settings) I was and am very happy with the picture on this TV.If you don't have a home theater system (and honestly, if you have a flat screen TV, you should) there are more than enough HDMI, component, optical and USB connectors to accommodate all your peripherals. I can't attest to the speakers on this TV as I've never used them. However, I do know that manufacturers throw cheap speakers into their TVS to keep the price down with little impact on end users.The TV is thin, thin, thin! At less than two inches thick it will look great up on a wall. I have mine on the included stand. The stand is heavily weighted to keep the TV stable, but it does add considerable size to the TV's foot print. The bezel is almost nonexistent, and when you watch the TV in a darkened room the effect is theater-like.There may be TVs with what you may consider better pictures, but they'll cost you quite a bit over the $1,000 retail price for this Vizio. However, at this price point the difference is considerable. This is a quality TV IMO with a picture as good if not better than TVs costing $400 to $600 more. With the money you save, you can buy a home theater if needed and still have money left over!The 3D picture on this TV is also fabulous, and with 8 pairs of included passive 3D glasses the whole family can watch a 3D movie right out of the box. If you invite your child's Little League team over to watch, well, you will run into a problem. LOL.This is a quality TV at a great price from a manufacturer that's making a lot of noise in the industry right now.

Saxton \"bsax\"", "ReviewID": "R1LZ2UNVWYMQ08", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "LG TV ReviewThis review is for the 50\u201d Visio M-Series. Amazon seems to be mixing the reviews for all M-Series TV\u2019s together. However, I don\u2019t see how this is fair given that each display panel has its own characteristics.The reviews of this TV all seem very positive. However, I find this TV has some critical problems \u2013 especially for those who are able to contemplate spending additional money on a Samsung or willing to go for less screen real estate in order to get a better picture (on a Samsung TV). (In my eyes-on comparisons at local stores, Samsung always had the superior display quality).That said, the pros to this TV are that you can get a good-sized TV with very good color quality, 3D, and some useful apps.The primary cons are brightness and the remote control system is poorly responsive.On ColorThe built-in calibrations/settings are poor. I went online to find some calibration settings that others had done, but they were all for the larger M-Series TV\u2019s. However, I used one set of settings as a baseline and then tweaked these settings until I was able to get a good match with my iPhone 5S (which I feel has excellent color reproduction). I am happy with the color reproduction.Here are my settings:Picture Mode: CalibratedBacklight: 100Contrast: 75Color: 60Tint: 0Sharpness: 20Color Temperature: NormalRed Gain: 549Green Gain: 472Blue Gain: 443Red Offset: 512Green Offset: 512Blue Offset: 514Advanced Settings:Auto Brightness: offBlack Detail: off (sometimes I might turn it on)Smart Dimming: off (sometimes I might turn it on)Smooth Motion effect: off (sometimes I might turn it on for sports)Reduce Signal Noise: LowReduce Black Level: LowFilm Mode: AutoHowever, annoyingly, when I switch to the built-in Vizio apps, the color settings re-set! For some reason, the TV keeps these settings independently of the typical HDMI input and you have to calibrate both within the Apps and when using your HDMI sources. I don\u2019t get that and it is poor execution or a bug on Vizio\u2019s part that I would hope could be remedied with a firmware update.Brightness and ContrastFrom reading the reviews and calibration settings, I have to wonder if my brightness concerns are linked to the 50\u201d version only. Calibration settings posted online all started with the backlight set to 50 which I found just too dark in general and too dark to gain appropriate contrast. One thing I will give this TV is that it is excellent at demonstrating a range of contrast  (with the backlight turned up)\u2013 it just doesn\u2019t get as bright as I would hope. Even with brightness, backlight, and contrast up, the screen just appears to be a bit dim. I have a theory that this is related to the 3D (which I will explain later). However, one solution to this is to watch in a darkened room \u2013 which is what we typically do \u2013 because your eyes will create the brightness and contrast in this situation (although you will notice more light bleed in very dark scenes)The smart-dimming is OK, however, I have decided to turn it off. The smart dimming breaks the TV into 16 independent backlight-dimming areas. It does work to give very deep blacks and then to push the brightness range back up for bright scenes. The drawback is that it 1) lags a bit so that you can see the backlight adjusting and 2) 16 brightness fields just isn\u2019t high enough resolution. When something in the middle of the screen is white and everything else is black, you see light bleed throughout the middle of the screen. I may turn it on occasion when I want deep blacks. However, seeing the uneven light bleed and delayed backlight adjustments tends to pull me out of the experience of the show I\u2019m watching to contemplate what the TV is doing\u2026The RemoteThe remote control system is annoying. I think when making the bezel, Vizio put the IR detector somewhere that it doesn\u2019t pick up very well. Therefore, you must point the remote directly at the bottom left of the TV for it to respond. Everything else, including the responsiveness of the interface, is just fine when you point the remote at the right spot!3DThe 3D works great and is fun. Of course, the passive system dims the TV even more. But, at that point you are enjoying the 3D and not the brightness \u2013 I feel the same even in movie theaters. I think when we finally get glasses-free 3D we\u2019ll be able to truly enjoy 3D.However, I think the passive 3D system is linked to the TV\u2019s overall brightness issues. All LCD TV\u2019s  require a polarized filter in order to vary the darkness of each pixel. (This includes LED TV\u2019s which are really LCD TV\u2019s with a LED backlights instead of CFL). Varying the darkness of each pixel is what gives you a color picture. However, passive 3D TV\u2019s require an additional polarizing film over the entire screen in order to create the 3D effect. Each polarizing film reduces the brightness somewhat. I believe this additional 3D filter is what causes much of my concerns about the TV\u2019s brightness. Active TV\u2019s do not require the additional polarizing film and therefore can achieve higher brightness.In SummaryThis TV replaced my circa 2007 42\u201d CFL backlit TV that was starting to dim overall, had some dim streaks on the TV, and just could not make a lot of contrast in the first place. This TV is light-years beyond that old TV. I\u2019m not a rich man and I have other financial priorities than having a giant top of the line TV. This TV will do for me (for now\u2026 I\u2019m young and I will upgrade down the line!).  This is a good TV with a good picture and the fun of 3D, with just a few manageable caveats (being the remote and ultimate brightness of the TV).", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "This TV was seemed great right out of the box", "Author": "Michael C.

Last week I got a notification from Vizio that a firmware update was ready to be installed (since I have the set on the network). Had to go through the configuration of devices but no big deal. Then I started to notice that my XBox 360 streaming WMC had a lag in the audio of up to 15-30 secs from the video. This was on all the HDMI ports. I then used my PS3 to stream my HD HomeRun Prime tuner directly and noted the same issue though it took longer to manifest itself.If I use the XBox 360 composite output to the set, no audio lag issues. I put in a support request but noted with web searches that this problem was introduced in other Vizio models a few years ago, so why is it now showing up on with this f/w update?

Because if you do the distance needed for an 80\" at 8 ft., you could spend a lot less and buy the 50\" because you can sit A LOT closer to the tv and still get the same clarity.

Everything the wife and I watched had the soap opera effect, which is where everything looks cheap and artificial, as if we were watching a soap opera.  Fortunately, this is a digital add-on effect that can be easily turned off.  It's called, I believe, Smooth Motion on these TVs, and you'll need to go into settings to turn it off.  If you're wondering, this a digital effect that creates additional frames to put between the existing frames to try and \"smooth\" out the picture.  Most people don't like it, ourselves included.  Once turned off though, the picture looked great.As for the problems most other reviews have pointed out, yes, they exist.  The remote is kind of sucky and needs to be pointed to the lower left hand corner to work and there is some light blooming in the corners although I can't see it when the picture is going.  But that said, it's a great picture and the 3D works well.  My wife is a bit disappointed that things don't jump out of the screen at you.  Not sure if that's the TV or simply how most 3D is filmed nowadays.  But the 3D (we've watched Avatar, Dredd and Titanic so far) does give you a great depth of field and makes movies much more immersive.  (Can't wait to watch Gravity on this.)  And hey, it's 80 inches!  Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime all look great on it (I was a bit worried the resolution from them wouldn't look great blown up so large, but no worries.)

Unboxing and assembly was a breeze; and the (soon to be) temporary optional integral mount is actually not too unattractive. However, for me there was a nemesis in the box... let me explain...I plugged everything up, slapped the batteries in the remote (all of which took 15 minutes from car to fireplace mantle) and... nadda. Not a tick, heartbeat, click nor buzz. This concerned me, Immensely. So I found the manual, actually read it (I forget those come in more than just assemble yourself furniture) and did all of their quick steps (again) and... again, nothing.Then came the self reflection. Did I just lay out over $1500 on an extremely pretty piece of contemporary art (because my shame, pride and arrogance will not let me return an item nor call customer service)? After a few minutes of panic, terror, and deep moral questioning... I did what all nerds do, I started looking for buttons to push.Well, I found the ONE button on the TV (which is modestly hidden on the back and passingly mentioned in the quick start guide because why do you need buttons when you have this fantastic remote control) and alas it came happily to life so I grabbed my trusty new and wonderful remote to start the installation process (which from my \"cost company\" sourced television asked me politely if I wanted STORE or HOME mode) and alas, nothing. It was impossible to simply move the cursor from \"DEMO\" to \"HOME\" and therefore impossible to proceed in the installation. After hitting buttons on this piece of apex technology for the requisite amount of time to look like a complete idiot; the TV mocked my pathetic and vain attempts- and went ahead and took the luxury of going into demo mode for me. How quaint.Perplexed I began to look at my new pride in disgust. Again pondering deeper philosophical questions about fairness, the universe taking vengeance on me, even delving into thoughts on karma; complexities which a simple TV installation should not muster. Then in utter and complete surrender, I bowed to my trusty overlord and Googled it. Well the wonderful newly designed (and a la Google buggy as hell) remote is crap. At least mine is crap (and quite a few other folks is crap too). If yours is not crap, I commend you. One of us has won the crappy remote lottery... and let me tell you MY piece of crap was happily glowing on the table... with no one near it and having been untouched for over 20 minutes. This is atypical behavior, or I have ghosts.So I picked it up and pointed it at one of my IR receivers that actually still gives feedback (think little red light glows when you hit a button on a remote; handy but annoying) and hey now... no signal... for any of the buttons. Eureka, -ish... Batteries out, wait, batteries back in... glowey piece of crap. Batteries out, wait, new batteries in... glowey piece of crap. From my nerd background all I can tell is that there is something stuck (either hardware or software side) in the remote which is why it glows (supposedly it has a sensor that lights up the remote when it is handled).Resetting the remote is not an option (all the remote did when I followed the idiot steps in the Quick Start guide was glow...at me), and there are no serviceable parts (i.e. it is a fused black box of remote confoundery), and at this point my wife is starting to giggle (yes it was an impulse buy). Tapping the remote did not work either, neither did hitting it. Now since I was all in at this point- disassembling it did no good either (well, \"disassemble\" may be a stretch as that would connote the possibility of reassembly) except to make me feel a little better and quite ashamed.So I happily post a question on Amazon (we are now 1.5 hours of stress, Google, giggling wife, now disassembled recently glowey pieces of crap, and sweat into what should have been a 20 minute install) and the obvious was presented to me.Sometimes it is the easiest and most elegant solutions which escape us in our times of need. Some use prayer, meditation, relaxation, drugs... I used Teek777 (big thanks again especially for the prompt response to the question I posted here) who recommended that I use one of my various universal remotes and program it. Voila. Formerly Glowey piece of no longer intact crap shan't ruin my new toy!I gaze wonderment at 65\" 240 HZ over-sized LED goodness which is no longer in demo mode. You know, the damn thing is so big in our living room I actually let out a chortle when I started playing the newest Star Trek (yes, I am that much of a nerd). I can't wait to have nerdgasms later on when I fire up the 3D (which somehow I'm afraid may require me to seek out a replacement remote)So the long story short is...The TV is great and at this price point is just outstanding; something tells me that this will be the TV that lasts us until (and if) 4K TV's drop in price point to this level and is replaced by simple attrition... the remote (if it works) looks superb, but it also is a piece of utter glowing crap and I will never forgive it for what it did to me.Caveat Emptor!", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "tv review", "Author": "Jim Donahue", "ReviewID": "R2BKKYMDXZ4Q79", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Normally my reviews are quick and easy to understand,but in order to meet what I need to do to make a review ,well all these x-tra words are needed in order to tell you how good this tv is ,so there you go!", "Date": "February 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great picture - HORRIBLE remote control", "Author": "NBJohn", "ReviewID": "R3PEEPMD4GTJSW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First off, this tv has a great aesthetic.

The Plasma has been great but this new Vizio is absolutely amazing.  The 3D quality is stunning and the picture quality for regular 2D is outstanding.  I did quite a bit of research and boiled my choices down to LG, Panasonic Plasma, and the Vizio.  The LG looked good but the price difference was too great in my opinion.  I was leaning towards the Panasonic based on my excellent experience with the set I've owned for 10 years or so.  I went to an electronics store to see both the Vizio and Panasonic 3D and that sold me on the Vizio.  The only complaint I have is the remote which is terrible.  Fortunately I have a Harmony and that works well with the Vizio.  Buy this set.  You won't be sorry.UPDATE:  Now that I have owned this set for 3 plus months I would like to add to my initial review.  While the set is still very good in terms of viewing pleasure it has developed some bugs in the last month or so.  The first is I sometimes lose audio, generally when changing channels.  I change the channel and I hear a \"pop\" and then no audio.  I have to turn off the set and then back on to get the audio working.  I use a Samsung Soundbar connected to the TV via HDMI Arc which works very well.  The TV completely controls Power on, off, etc.  The issue is not a problem with the Soundbar as I experienced the same thing when the TV was connected to a BOSE Cinemate system.The second glitch, which is far more annoying, is the TV sometimes fails to power up.  I hit my Harmony remote to Power Up the TV, Soundbar, and Cable Box and the TV fails to come on.  I have tried pushing the manual button on the back of the set but no joy.  The only way to get the TV to power up is to pull the power cord, wait 10 seconds or so, and then plug it back in.  Then it powers up and plays without any issues.I did get an extended warranty with the set which I think I will be using in the near future.  This is my first Vizio, and while it has many great features, I fear it is not going to be very dependable over time.

If you have this coaxial cable then you will need to scan the channels. Read carefully--this simple step would have meant a 15-minute set-up instead of an hour and 15 minutes!

At this price point, for a 60\" screen, it is a decent buy. I did the latest firmware update and am running V1.08.120000. I tried out various picture calibration settings found here and on the web, but none produced satisfactory results, so I decided to trust my own eyes. Here are the results:For everyday TV/Movie watching, I found that the built-in \"Calibrated\" mode was the best place to begin tweaking. To my eye, this mode shifts to a too-greenish hue, which can then be eliminated by switching to the \"Cool\" color temp setting. No other color adjustments were needed. I turned the brightness down to 39, which improved things considerably. Under \"Advanced Picture\" I turned the \"Auto Brightess\", \"Black Detail\" and \"Smooth Motion Effect\" OFF, while leaving \"Smart Dimming\" ON. The \"Smooth Motion Effect\" doesn't seem to be needed watching sports, and when watching movies with it turned ON it imparts what is termed the \"soap opera\" effect. I should note that for any serious movie watching, I switch over to my Panasonic HD projector, which is much better at rendering a film-like effect. But the Vizio does OK in this regard for casual watching. I also use this as a computer monitor, and the built-in \"Computer\" mode works fine. However, it cannot replace a properly calibrated computer monitor.I am not a fan of 3D, but the effect works fine on this set for those who are into it.Bottom line: For nominally $1300, this set is decent and fairly versatile. You do have to tweak the settings to your taste. Is it perfect? Nope.

My advice:  do not make any picture adjustments , color, etc, until the tv is connected to your wifi! The process involves completely resetting back to factory defaults.

Folks that normally think of Vizio as a \"value vendor\" vs. \"high quality vendor\" (normally thought to be Samsung) will be pleasantly surprised. I did my homework when I was interested in buying a new TV larger than 50 inches. And what consistently showed up in Google searches for TV reviews with positive feedback was Vizio's new M series. I went to Costco to take a look at the screens (they had all the sizes of this series up to 80 inches). I was impressed. Sleek industrial design, impressive image quality, and a price that makes you think \"Is that really all they're asking to take this bad boy home?\" (compared to other vendors for same size). It was a no brainer. After using iPhone to check prices, Costco had the best price all around and immediately decided to buy it (Costco \"mirrors\" a vendor's warranty, so effectively you're covered for 2 years, which is a nice bonus). After grabbing a tape measure from one of the Costco employees to verify it would fit in my VW Tiguan, I promptly wheeled it up to the cashier.There were only 4 pairs of 3D glasses included in the box (there should have been 8 pairs included), so I'll need to contact Vizio about that.After having enjoyed the TV for about a week now, I'm very glad I bought it.Disclaimer: I have not tested the sound quality nor do I care to, what I care about in a TV is image quality. I always connect any TV I own to my Sonos wireless music system. I also have not tried the TV apps as I use an Apple TV to stream movies.CONSUsing the remote for first time left me thinking something was wrong, pushing buttons wouldn't turn on TV on first press and seemed like it required multiple key presses for TV to recognize you wanted to change something. It turns out you have to point the remote to the bottom left corner of the TV. After reading the manual (who reads manuals these days?) it does mention that's how it was intended to operate. Which I think was a poor design choice. With my 46\" Samsung TV (model number UN46C6900VFXZA), I can point the remote almost anywhere and the TV recognizes the signal just fine.I think the menu navigation could be improved, it's not the best nor is it the worse experience. It's OK. Gets the job done when you want to change a setting, but coming from using a Samsung, I prefer Samsung's menu navigation.PROSAmazing image qualityPassive 3D image quality is superb, watch Avatar in Bluray 3D, you'll see what I mean (PS3 was used for playback)Very nice design, fits nicely with living room decor", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "240Hz Worth It!", "Author": "Ray Kendrick", "ReviewID": "RAC2WONETC442", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a little hesitant about the extra cost of 240Hz, but now I am glad I did it.

CEVA was 3 and a half hours late, but at least they were nice when they did finally arrive... but I digress.Got the TV unboxed, hung it up on my stand and powered it up. Immediately, I noticed some serious banding in the screen. For a 2013 model TV, that is unacceptable. Also, the screen on the 65\" (and that model alone) is super glossy, so if you are planning on putting this TV in a room with lots of ambient light, prepare yourself for reflection city. In 3D mode, you can only turn off motion smoothing if you set the display to Game Mode. You cannot adjust the backlight. Kind of weird, but maybe they will fix it up a software update.I haven't had any problems with the remote responsiveness and via CEC, I'm able to control my PS3 pretty easily.The color is absolutely beautiful and the picture quality is great, however the awful banding completely negates that. If you're unaware of what screen banding is, it looks like a dark grid on your TV due to lighting uniformity issues. I was reading up on this TV on AVSforum and one other user had the same exact issue. He returned the TV and got the M701d-A3R which doesn't have the banding or glossy screen.I'm absolutely torn, but I'll probably end up exchanging this for the M601d-A3R.Pros:Beautiful colorsExcellent contrastHuge screenGreat priceVIZIO Internet Apps (VIA) work fast and smoothlyCons:Horrible backlight uniformity issuesScreen is as glossy as a smartphone displayCannot adjust backlight in 3D mode", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Vizio M-Series VS Samsung H6350", "Author": "JB", "ReviewID": "R1J9RTMQXXP2WG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I left this in the question section and wanted to add it to both TV reviews for everyone to see.I just purchased the Vizio M401i and it was delivered 3 days ago, it's already going back in the box and being sent back. None of the VIA apps that stream from the net worked even when I am connected to my wireless network and using the test function for net getting 15MB down to the TV, but I know for a fact that it was able to connect to their server and download the firmware for the device. I called Vizio support on this and the technician was reading from a script and had no insight on actually how to fix the problem other than to do a full reset then refer it to the second level technicians. LOL everything with their support was a joke, I spent over an hour on the phone to no avail, and I'm very tech savvy so it was a complete waste of time. The Vizio also will not connect correctly to the ZYXEL NAS320 that I have on my network hosting media content with movies, pictures, and music. It will not recognize any content on the device even though it sees it on my network and does not support common file extensions like MKV, MWA, or AVI. I did extensive research only to realize that I would have to run all my content through a converter and make them MPEG4 before this would stream them across the network.I will admit the picture on this TV was good and I'm doing OTA tv and that was fine. The main reason I bought it was to get Amazon Prime content in the bedroom and to access my NAS for movies, neither of which the Vizio will do. I have a Samsung D8000 series in the living room so I have a good comparison source which will do everything I have mentioned above and more, only the 2011 models don't have the Amazon app. This one is going back and I will be purchasing this Samsung. The Vizio will save you a little money but for me $140 just isn't worth the extra aggravation that I've had to put up with. You get what you pay for and this is another example of that. As  soon as I get the refund for the Vizio I will be having this one sent to me.Update: Return complete on the Vizio and I have purchased the Samsung H6350 and had a couple days to work with it. It's like getting out of a Ford Fiesta and getting into a GT500 Mustang. (That's for all you guys out there ;-P) Picture is in my estimate is 20% better so even though the Vizio has a very good picture this one is better, very feature rich including Channel Guide that even works with OTA reception and Set Top Box controls plus full network support for connecting to my NAS and other DLNA compatible devices. Network is fast and reliable as well, streamed BluRay movie from both the NAS and Amazon Prime without any hiccups and flawless picture, sound is slightly lower but I don't really expect perfection from 2@10W speakers just turn it up 4 or 5 more and it's very adequate.Did have one issue that came up but it wasn't a major problem, network was found but wouldn't join I'm assuming because of the drivers of the wireless card. I run a WPA2 network with AES encryption and ended up putting the password 6 or 7 times trying to get it to join to no avail. I went to the router and turned on my guest network with no encryption, hopped on it and updated the firmware then no more problem got connected to the secured network first time. The onscreen keyboard is a qwerty keyboard and navigation is somewhat cumbersome but expected since the remote doesn't have a full keyboard like my F8000 Samsung does.In conclusion you get what you pay for, the Samsung was about $150 more than the Vizio but well worth the money in my opinion. I'm a techie and worked in the computer field for over 15 years so I am very particular about my electronics and computers. I was trying to save a few dollars by purchasing the Vizio and while it is fine for doing just the bare minimum for TV and has some Smart features there is no comparison to a quality Samsung product. I bought the M-Series because it was supposed to be the most feature rich between it and the E-Series only to be disappointed in overall performance and functionality.

I would advice others to go by what TV suits your home, rather than just ratings. I need a day to day tv (watching news, movies etc) and I am getting annoyed at the color degradation in side view. Unless you sit front and center, the colors fade and progressively washes. Also color uniformity ..for instance, GMA anchors and studio shots are very bright and when the feed moves away from studio, the color lightens up. The glossy screen with bright images forces me to sit at least 10-12 feet away from a 70 inch. I loved the colors of old 9 year Sony lcd projection. It seems manufacturers are going for so called \"smart\" and slim tv. I can use my computer lcd for that stuff and netflix streaming can be done through roku. Don't get me wrong. This TV (40-60 inches) is great if your primary goal is for gaming/movies etc. But I am not sure LED is for me, for day to day use. I am seeing similar reviews of the other pricier model, so I dont think that is going to solve my inherent issues. May take a second look at plasma. Have another 60 days to evaluate.Old review:This is my first LED display so it took some time to get used to. Coming from an old sony lcd, the display panel is quite glossy (have the 70 inch ). But when viewing, it is fine as long as no light sources in the front. You can get away with it for regular viewing but for movies, you can see the reflecting lamp, so I have now switched to  using a backlight next to TV, as opposed to facing the TV.Out of the box, the colors are too unnatural and bright (yellow and orange faces). This can be fixed by the calibrated picture setting, someone posted here (thank you!). I dont care for the smart features, not sure why that is big these days..on large screen TV. Won't be using much of that or the 3D. Just want day to day great picture quality. After calibration, PQ is great. Non-HD isn't as good but that is partly cable, I suppose. One thing though, side angle views get progressively washed out, but after looking at reviews of the more expensive samsung, they all suffer from this. Would have gotten plasma but for windows facing TV.After a few days, I am now getting used to the Picture quality and it is quite good. Is it the best? probably not, but for 70 inch at this price point, this is the best there is. Did run a blue ray dvd, it was gorgeous. Everyone is complaining about the remote here, but honestly not much of an issue. you just need to point to bottom left. And I use cable remote for channels. When picture switches to a lower resolution, there are black bars around (the display mode has a stretch mode but that messes regular hd channels). Noticed some led lighting flicker at top.But all in all, hd channels are great. Make sure to calibrate your picture mode. Tint set to 0..(the settings are in one of the reviews here). Samsung or Sony might provide a better PQ but the 10% PQ upgrade (if at all), may not justify paying over 5K for those TV.

Wanted to go up a size and try 3D so bought the M701d-A3R.3D:  I was amazed at how good the 3D is.  Every bit as good as the theatre with the exception of the screen size.  We have been enjoying watching whatever 3D we can find.DESIGN: As far as the look, the thin frame looks nice and it doesn't have the annoying lit up Vizio logo the XVT did.REMOTE:  As others have mentioned, the remote pretty much sucks.  Buttons don't push well and my TV has not received the update to use the Bluetooth so you have to aim it at the bottom left.  I read that an update enabled the Bluetooth but I have had mine for a week and I never received the update.  However, I called customer service and the friendly person on the other end said that there was an update to fix the Bluetooth but it hadn't been released yet.  In the meantime, they would send me a new remote.  I asked if the new remote would fix the problem, but she said it probably wouldn't until the update.  She had me try holding the FFWD and ENTER buttons simultaneously for 12 seconds to pair it with the TV but it didn't work.  You can check the system information in the menu to see if it is paired or not.  So, I guess I will wait for the update.  She said the problem was that if there were other devices in the home it confused the remote and it couldn't sync with the TV.  I got spoiled with the remote on the XVT, it had a slide out keyboard that was awesome when typing in search terms or ids and passwords on Internet apps.  I can't believe Vizio dropped the remote that was on the XVT.  The Bluetooth was flawless.PICTURE:  Not as impressed with the picture as much as I thought I would out of the box.  Seemed to have some pixellation or blurriness which seems to vary based on the show or channel.  Turning off the smooth motion seemed to help.  I have not messed with the picture settings yet or calibrated it.  But overall the picture is good when I don't see the pixellation.  The funny thing is in 3D it looks perfect and streaming SuperHD on Netflix or HDX on Vudu.  I am sure with some tweaking it will look as good as the XVT.GAMES:  The games on the Xbox One look awesome on this TV.  Great size for that.VIA APPS;  Typical Internet Apps that are easy to get to.  A nice variety, but not as flexible as on the XVT but they seem to load faster.STREAMING 3D:  I was excited that Netflix supported it but have a hard time finding 3D titles, there is no genre or way to find them and putting in \"3D\" in the search only finds titles with 3D in them which there are only a few.  However, if you know a title that is 3D and find it, you will see the 3D indicator that shows the M701 is a valid device.  By the way, even though the outdated page on Netflix says only some devices are compatible, the VIzio M-series is and you will see the SuperHD indicator and 3D when you find a 3D movie.  I chatted with Netflix customer service asking how to find 3D movies easily and she said they dropped the 3D genre list because it wasn't picking them up... pretty stupid since now there is no way to get a list and searching the Internet for a Netflix 3D list came up with nothing.  I also read an article that said the Netflix product manager said Netflix will not be expanding their 3D offering.  Pretty disappointing!VUDU has several titles and there are a few free 3D channels on the Sony Blu-Ray I have.  Also, Dish has a few pay per view titles.SUMMARY:  Overall I am satisfied with the TV and it is a great value for the money due to the size, 3D, and other features.  One thing that bugs me is that the media has started down the \"3D TV is dead\" trend and the fear is that 3D will die for TVs.  But even if 3D does die the TV is worth it.

We use it only for turning the TV on/off and adjusting the volume. We have to be directly in front of the TV and press the volume button really hard, usually multiple times, for the TV to pick it up. If we're off to the side, like sitting at the desk literally right next to the TV, it will not pick it up. We have to move in front of the TV to adjust the volume. The power button doesn't seem to have that issue so perhaps it's just a problem with the volume buttons.It's annoying to say the least, but we're very happy with the TV so we're willing to live with it.", "Date": "August 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bigger may not always be Better", "Author": "Tony Cinquini", "ReviewID": "R2CTCMQZ7TNALV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I always enjoy and appreciate those folks who take the time to post reviews and opinions about the products they purchase, so I thought I'd take the time to pass along my thoughts on my recent purchase of a Vizio 65\" M651d-A2R (through BB, not Amazon). And why I ended up taking it back and replacing it with 55\" Sony model instead.My first thought is simply about buying any 65\" TV - if you are looking at the large display of TV's in a typical store, your eyes may have you thinking that bigger will always be better. I think I must have fallen for this idea a bit, since I had actually gone out to purchase a 55\" TV, but ended up buying this much larger 65\" TV instead. Trouble was, once I actually got the 65\" TV home, I soon realized that it seemed to be a bit \"overpowering\" for the room size and sitting distance where I was planning to use it (my sweet spot \"best seat\" position was only about 10 feet away from the screen).Things I really liked about the Vizio... the passive 3D was amazing. I had downloaded some really great 3D files from the Internet, placed them on a USB drive, then played them through the TV and they really looked fantastic.The Vizio also had a pretty good picture when you were looking at it dead on, but I did notice that there was a fairly significant color drop once you began to move around or tried viewing the screen from a side angle.Other people had mentioned about the high gloss, very reflective screen on this TV and I can also say that I too was somewhat disappointed that I could clearly see myself and my chair and all the pictures on the wall behind me reflecting off the TV screen as I tried to watch the TV during the daytime (but this does not seem to be a problem when viewing it at night or in a darken room).But by far, the actual worse part of the Vizio for me was simply the \"Remote\" - I can't begin to tell you how many times I had to hit and re-hit the buttons on the remote to get them to function correctly. I tried using it up close and far away and it was just NOT GOOD in any location! And I know that the problem was with the actual remote, because when I programmed my TiVo remote to do some of the same Vizio functions (such as on/off, volume/mute, and video input)... everything on the Vizio worked perfectly fine as long as it was receiving the signals from the TiVo remote.So in the end, I ended up taking the 65\" Vizio back to BB and replaced it with a 55\" Sony Bravia KLD55W900A - I realize that this is not quite a fair comparison, since the Sony actually costs about $500.00 more than the Vizio, but my goodness, if I was to compare the two TVs, by far the picture on the Sony outshined the Vizio. The color and clarity on the Sony is simply unbelievable and mind blowing (and it seems to be that way from all angles) PLUS, the remote on the Sony actually works just the way one would think a TV remote is supposed to work! :)", "Date": "August 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV for the price!!!", "Author": "matthew pferchy", "ReviewID": "R7T1MM3C3S86Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was such a great purchase!

There was some skepticism about it being a Vizio but that dissipated shortly after using the TV the first week. The picture is very good and even great at times so there were now complaints to be had. The 8 glasses it came with were more than enough to get movie night rolling and after trying Avengers in 3D i was sold on why i bought this TV. I'm currently using a soundbar so I can't comment on sound quality. But i can tell you that audio pass-through works pretty well. Meaning that you can send the audio signal into the TV and it redirects it to the soundbar with no issues. My sound bar is connected via optical cables which I had to run into my cable box and PS3 previously. Not anymore thanks to this TV, it lessened the clutter and pushed the digital sound thru with no problem. This is my 1st Vizio smart TV so I can't compare the speed of using the smart apps to anything previous but they seem pretty snappy and work rather well from my daily use. I did not notice a web browser but I don't really need that seing as how most people have laptops, tablets, and smartphones to handle that task. The only issue I have had this far is that the amazon app is a little spotty when trying to play videos and it's connected via ethernet. It works perfectly when wireless but has turned my TV off when directly connected. I haven't been able to isolate the issue to the app itself, my modem, router, or multiple ethernet cables. Either way it works great via wifi so I guess wireless it is. Not sure if anyone else has had this issue but if you have this TV, give it a shot and let me know if it's just my TV? Overall, i would recommend this TV and can now say that Vizio is reputable to take a chance on their consumer products. We've always used their soundbars at work and now they're TV's have made me a believer. I've had and currently have 3 samsung TV's (Plasma, LCD, and DLP) in the house as well so I have a pretty good gauge to compare against. The Vizio is holding it's own very well and did I mention great it is to play games on. I have not noticed any lag whatsoever and can't wait to see what this thing can do when the PS4 comes to town. :)Update: 1/23/14The TV is being returned as per Vizio. They are unable to repair at this time and an only offer a rebate for my purchase. This is a major let down in my eyes as the TV has been great up until now. I still stand by the performance of the TV itself but question the build quality. It's also possible that I just got a faulty set as being an early adopter. I can't answer that question but know that I am not happy at all about giving up the TV. In the beginning I mentioned my issue with the Amazon app not working properly which seems to have been an indicator of things to come. Now the TV will not allow me to turn it off. Let me elaborate, if the TV is plugged up it will turn itself on and if you attempt to turn it off, a few seconds later it will power itself back on. I have never had this issue with any other TV's in the past so I was a little taken back by this. No idea why that happens but that also while navigating the menus it will power itself off depending on the buttons pressed on the remote. And for those of you that haven't purchased this device yet, the IR receiver on the TV is not easily visible making the remote very difficult at times to use. Again, not trying to sway the overall performance of the TV but being as honest as possible after owning it for 6+ months and daily use. This TV has the potential to be great again...Vizio just has to make some tweaks to fine tune the overall package. I have not been turned away from Vizio but will currently look elsewhere for a replacement TV.

So obviously, I was going to be impressed by whatever I bought. That being said, I am amazed by the quality, picture, and performance of what some consider a \"cheap\" brand, Vizio. This TV is pretty spectacular. We cut out cable a few years ago, and with the smart apps, an Apple TV and a Google Chromecast, there's very little we can't watch. The picture is superb, even in our dimly lit basement. Black levels are about as good as you could expect from an LED screen. Sound is....well, flatscreen sound. We bought a Vizio 5.1 soundbar and it basically blows the doors off the house. Highly recommend the soundbar, but that's another review. Setup was a breeze with WiFi, HDMI and optical audio cables connecting all the components. Wall mounting had some slight problems, as the supplied screws weren't long enough to go through the mount and completely into the back of the set. I found some longer ones easily at a local hardware store, but still for $1600 you'd think they could include 4 extra screws, because seriously who doesn't wall mount a 60\" flatscreen? Besides the bolts, only two things stopped me from giving this 5 stars: the \"Smooth Motion\" feature is pretty nauseating, especially when you have it cranked up to high. Everything is way too clear, way too crisp, and way too \"soap opera-ish.\" Had to turn it off after 5 minutes. I'm hoping it will be more effective when football season rolls around, but for now, it's just too real. I know, first world problems, right? The second issue is the lack of a stand-alone web browser included in the Smart Apps. How hard is this? My $99 smart phone has one, why can't a $1600 web-enabled TV? It's basically a computer already, why not add this one extra feature? I've worked around it with ChromeCast, but still, minus one star.

I called Amazon and they said there's something different about the Viso 2014 models and they haven't been able to get it working yet but that they have high hopes but no time frame of when it might start working.  So lf you looking for a set that does Amazon video now you might want to consider other sets for now.  Amazon does maintain a list of compatible sets (this set is not on it) so you look up one that does work now.  Also I called Visio and they said yes they know it does not work with Amazon video but don't mind claiming it does because they think it will some day.

This was not covered in the Amazon webpage instructions.The TV picture is impressive! My husband is very happy with it. There are a few minor gripes: We quickly populated all inputs (and will be installing a HDMI switch), but more significant was the limited remote control.. Very nice for what it does control, but will not control either my receiver/amp (Pioneer VSX-9700S) nor my Dish receiver DVR (Dish Vip722k duo). With some Google searches, I found that this is a common problem with Vizio. Experimenting, we found a code for the DVR remote that would power on/off the Vizio but was quite limited. We will continue to experiment. Better was our old cheap Universal Remote (Phillips Universal DVR remote SRU4208WM17) that would work with all devices including the Vizio TV.

With the 2 floorstanding speakers, we will not need a receiver since we can plug straight into the R/L audio out jacks in the back of the tv.If you are debating between the 60 inch and 65, do the 65.

MY HONEST RATING IS 2.5 STARS NOT 3", "Author": "Brandy.A.", "ReviewID": "R3NZZLRKY9N4BM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV hoping to save money.  The Vizio 60\" I got from Amazon arrived in a timely manner.  Packaging was fairly decent from Vizio.  Could have been better.  You can't imagine the difficulty of removing a 60\" Tv from a box that has the part of the stand attached.  The Vizio is thicker and heavier than most of this years 3D LCD TV lineup.  The picture was nice enough for the price.  There was a lot of graininess and pixelation.  I had to do some tweaking and calibrations to find the right setting to eliminate these issues, but at the cost of crushing some black color and detail in dark scenes.  Smart dimming helps by making the top and bottom cinema bars blacker during movies.  Downfall of this feature is although you will get deeper blacks, you will see noticeable flash lighting and banding along the sides of the screen as the lighting follows the image.  For instance, if you have a movie in with a lot of darkness in the scenes, you will see the lighting from the sides flowing inward toward the center.  This is most noticeable during credits as well.  If you turn off Smart Dimming Blacks become less black to the point of being a very dark gray.  To combat this, you will need to turn your brightness way down.  I did find the perfect settings for the TV, and was quite happy with it until bigger issues popped up.PROS:3D was excellent.  You cannot control some settings in 3D though.Decent Picture for the priceGood Color though tends to push more redGood BlacksGood Screen but reflectiveDecent AestheticsGood Gaming little to no noticeable lag.CONS:Remote- this could have been improved.  Feels clunky.Apps -the WORST interface for Apps.  They should all be full screen apps and easier on the eyes.No way to update TV manually.  You have to wait for Vizio to push updates.Software glitches, freezing and needing to reboot TV.No external power buttonsCalibration lacking & limited.Picture not as sharp or clear as other brands.  Noticeable graininess and pixelation despite calibration.Banding/lighting. (See Amazon user photo)Uniformity issues  (See Amazon user photo)Vizio support had no real fix for the Apps Crashing the TV.  You will have to just not use YouTube or Yahoo until it's hopefully fixed in a firmware update in the future.Rare occurrence of  \"flicker\" on screen.DEAL BREAKERS:Although, I was able to obtain a decent picture quality, and 3D is excellent on this Tv,  the Tv has a few MAJOR flaws in design and also software.  First, there are no power buttons externally on the Vizio.  This became a major issue for me when using the YouTube and Yahoo Apps the Tv comes with.  The Tv froze, went to a blank screen and I couldn't power the Tv off.  The Vizio remote was unresponsive and my programmed DirecTv remote also couldn't power the Tv off.  The only solution was for me to unplug the Tv from the wall and reset it. This \"freezing\" happened several times when accessing the YouTube App or Yahoo App.  Unfortunately, the Vizio is based on Yahoo apps.  The Apps are more or less widgets.  They appear in a smaller window to the left of your screen.  You will only have 4 Full screen Apps.  Those are Hulu, NetFlix, Vudu and Pandora.  The rest of them, including Amazon Instant, appear in a widget window.  Worst version of Amazon Instant I have ever seen!  Plus, there will be no watch list for your Amazon and the search is horrible.  If you love your Amazon as I do,  skip this TV.  As for the remote, you literally have to aim it at the bottom left of the Tv or you will be finding yourself making several attempts to get a response on the Tv.  We did notice while watching Dexter on Showtime,  the Vizio screen went black for a split second.  I rewound the DVR, watched the same scene and it did not happen again.  This confirmed it was the Vizio.  It also happened several days later watching MasterChef.  Glitch?RECOMMENDATIONS:If you want to save a lot of money and get a decent 3D Tv and you don't care about Apps, or  feel the need to have the best picture quality possible, then the Vizio may be what you are looking for.  Just be ready to deal with the quirks in software, remote issues and lighting quirks.  My husband felt he could live with it for the price.  I couldn't.  The freezing on App use, remote, and the Amazon App broke the deal for me.  I eventually settled on spending more $$ and bought the Samsung UNF8000 and couldn't be happier.  Amazing TV, perfect screen, apps, 3D and you certainly see where your $$$ is going.  Not an ounce of buyer's remorse do I feel.  Amazon was great about me returning the TV at day 27 of having it.

I'm now in process of returning the TV and getting a Sony KDL-60R550A instead. The 65' Vizio I have has a major vertical band/line going down the middle. Drives me nuts and once I noticed this I couldn't take my eyes off of it. You see it here and there when screen moves from left to right or when screen is a bright blue (PS3 main screen). Also picture looks a bit fuzzy for some movies. Maybe I got a dud? I like alot of things about the TV, but it just doesn't work the way I want it to. I was torn in returning this because for the most part I like the TV. I just cant get over the line in the middle of the TV. Instead of getting another I'm just going back to the brand I trust. Sony.Also worth mentioning. The screen is mirror like. Not a good thing and will be very annoying if this is placed in a room with multiple windows or light sources. This bothered me in a room with one window. The screen is a magnet for light which makes you wonder why in the world would they put this on the TV?This TV also does not work with your smart phone. I wanted to be able to have my smart phone mirror the TV with pictures and videos. The Sony KDL-60R550A does exactly that. This was a major problem for me.Boast to have 240hz but doesn't seem to run that way.Honestly I think the TV is decent. I'm thinking it may be hit and miss with this TV. Meaning there are some good ones and then a few bad ones. It has the things you are looking for in a TV, but the parts (China) are probably not the best quality.You get what you pay for in this TV. It will impress out of the box, but test it out and make sure you don't have any problems early on.  This TV is kinda like the intro or basic version of what a smart TV should be in my opinion.

Let that slide, because the Tivo remote did better than the Vizio one.Finally, two days ago Vizio prompted me to do an update on the TV, and it had me point the remote at the TV, so I assume it was updating the remote.

Even tried pointing it at a digital camera, showed nothing. This means the IR transmitter is busted.I'm sick of the disappointment with this TV.

I did not buy this TV from Amazon, it was purchased at Best Buy for the same price ($798 at the time of this review).  I upgraded to this TV from a 42\" 720p Samsung in my living room.  I also looked at the Vizio E-Series because it was cheaper and I may be able to get a bigger size, but the side-by-side comparison at Best Buy made me jump for the M-Series.What a world of difference!  When I bought the Samsung HD programming was still new, and cable was not putting out full 1080p.  Now they are, and the picture is so clear that it looks better than real life at times!  It can be seen at wide angles, but beware of those windows as this has a very glossy finish (my wife demanded the glossy finish) so it will produce some glare.  But if you have a swivel stand (the stock stand does not swivel) then that shouldn't be a problem.  TV is great, Blu-Ray is awesome, and 3D is a bonus that we have come to enjoy.  It comes with 8 pairs of 3D glasses like you would get in a movie theater.  As long as you are looking at the TV straight on you will get a theater-like 3D experience.  Off to the sides, not as much, although you will get some 3D effect.Gaming is also fantastic on here.  I've hooked up the 360 to it and games like Skyrim have taken on new wonder in the level of detail!  I couldn't tell too much difference with the Wii, but that is only able to output at lower HD so I wasn't expecting to be amazed.  I've also hooked up my laptop to the HDMI and it connected perfectly fine.All in all, I would definitely buy this TV again.  Now that HDTVs have come down in price I felt that it was a good buy.

While I was on hold with Amazon I had a chance to go back and look through the reviews on this product.  Everyone for the most part seems satisfied with the TV.  I even went to Best Buy to purchase a replacement for this TV over the past weekend and the guy at the store had nothing but good things to say about it.  He was actually surprised at the number of issues I have had.  In fact the Amazon reviews for this TV are actually BETTER than the Samsung TV I just purchased!!  I did notice something that COULD be a contributing factor to at least SOME of the issues I've had.  The shipping company CEVA.  A few observations I made....1) 3 TV's delivered that are clearly labeled as \"2 Man Lift\".....one guy brought them each time.2) The CEVA driver dropped my first TV on the driveway.....this TV would not even power up.....coincidence?3) The second TV had a ripped \"handle area\" on the package.  What this says to me is that the package was most likely picked up by that handle, which ripped and then the packaged set fell some unknown distance.  1-2 feet most likely?  Of course this is all speculation, but I did note the box was damaged on the delivery form.4) Honestly, based on how each of the drivers handled the TV's while I was present, I can't even begin to imagine how they were handled when I wasn't.5) Also of note (this is more of a Vizio issue) this TV is 20 lbs heavier than the Samsung I just purchased, but the package is much less robust.  This shouldn't be an issue unless the package is being handled like the one in the opening scene of Ace Ventura Pet Detective.Update 7/27/2013:  After several days with this TV I can tell you it's not for those that expect perfection or even near perfection.  As, I mentioned below my THIRD TV arrived with a stuck pixel, but this is minor so I opted to keep it.  Now, it has developed a cluster of 4 pixels that flash blue.  Additionally, I've had several incidents where the TV has just locked up and required unplugging from the power outlet in order to reset.  The Amazon VIA app is hit or miss; sometimes it works fine, but often it won't allow me to select content and I have to turn the TV off and back on to get it to work.  I still think the picture is great for the money and I REALLY wanted to like this TV, but I couldn't recommend it to anyone based on my experience. This one will go back to Amazon next week and I'm on my way out right now to order a Samsung from my local big box electronics store.Update:  Received my 3rd Vizio M651-A2R and it's the best of the 3 so far, but not perfect.  It has one stuck (green) pixel about 1cm from the left edge.  Does this bother me?  Yes, it does, but frankly I'm just tired of receiving and sending back TV's.  Besides, this defect would probably go unnoticed by most as it's only visible if you are about 1.5' - 2' directly in front of the suspect pixel.  If standing directly in front of the TV from any distance it can't be seen.  I also have a 46\" Sony LCD that has a similar artifact.  I'm beginning to think it's just part of the package with a large, value priced panel.  Hopefully this will be the only issue with this set because as I've already mentioned the picture is just flat out amazing.  Bumping my review to 4 stars.I'm in the process of getting my 3rd Vizio M651-A2R.  The first one would not power on at all and the second one has dead pixels.  I gave it 3 stars as the picture on the set is amazing, but if this 3rd set doesn't work out I'm going to move on to another brand.  Has anyone else had such issues?On a side note, I purchased two Vizio E320i-A0 at the same time.....dead and stuck pixels on both.

The Costco version has no R in the model number. The Costco version has 4 3D glasses compared to 8 with models having the R in the model number. I researched and researched for a new TV for about a month or so and narrowed it down to this model. As you probably guessed, I did not order the TV from Amazon but from Costco online as it was the best deal by a few bucks. Costco had the TV on sale which beat Amazon by a $100 and I used that to buy the 5 year extended warranty.  Being new to the Vizio brand, I did not know much about the quality and build hence the warranty. I am used to Samsung and Sony as my go to brand for televisions and electronics. Before I ordered the TV online, I went to Costco to try to compare picture quality which is not the best way to do a TV picture comparison (due to warehouse lighting to go with Costco's \"HD feed which isn't great to begin with).  My initial impression is that the picture quality on the Vizio was just as good as the Samsungs. The only difference I could tell was that the Samsungs picture was a little brighter than the Vizio and the Vizio was brighter and clearer than the Sharp.  In general the picture quality was about the same across the board among the various brands except for the 80inch Sharp on display. The Sharp's picture wasn't as crisp as the others.  I went home and took the plunge. TV arrived via Ceva which I believe Amazon uses as well as Costco. Now, why would Ceva send just one guy to deliver a 70inch TV? That is just plain stupid.  I am now an unpaid employee of Ceva since I had to help unload the TV from the truck, move it upstairs, unpack and set up it up. Luckily I am a big, strong guy albeit with a bad back and bum knees but what if I was unable to help or wasn't strong enough to move the TV? This wasn't part of the deal and I think it was very unprofessional of Ceva to send one person to move such a large TV.  Not only that but the guy they had deliver it must not have brushed his teeth in years as they were rotten, black and more than half was missing. Halitosis is not a strong enough word to describe the awful smell of the delivery guy's breath. WTF, WTF, WTF and to smell it while huffing and puffing up the stairs was painful on my nose (and my back). I was literally on the verge of crying from his breath. Thanks Tim for the unforgettable smell of dead rotten flesh.Anyway back to the TV. If you are on the fence, I would emphatically say to go ahead and get it. The TV is gorgeous from just the design aspect. It is very simplistic and understated. As other viewers put it, the TV has glare in bright rooms but so did my last 46inch LCD from Samsung. The TV is not as mirror-like as some said but somewhere in the middle of glossy and matte. I have a window right behind the seating area which reflects on the TV and it is annoying just like with my last TV.  Picture quality is just as gorgeous as the physical display depending on the source. The TV is hooked up to DirecTV and most HD programs look amazing. I haven't really messed around with the picture settings but left it on default (Vivid) mode and everything HD is bright and crisp. Non HD not so much. It really shows on a bigger TV with stretch format from the DirecTV box but I switched to crop mode and it is acceptable with the black bars. Blu-ray is just awesome using the Playstation3 Blu-ray player. I mean it is really a nice picture with Blu-ray movies.  I haven't tried 3D because I don't have any 3D stuff but will soon. Setup was ok but as other users stated, the remote is slow and not very responsive and no QWERTY keypad makes it slow and tedious. Netflix movies were great and were as quick as Xbox or PS3 to load. I haven't tried any of the other apps like Youtube or Hulu but will soon to test it and will update my review when I do. So far so good after a couple of days with the TV and the value for what you get can't be beat.

I found the picture to be extremely dark with a considerable amount of uniformity issues. The screen lacks \u201cpop\u201d especially in darker scenes. Admittedly, the TV did perform will when displaying animated features or programs that are bright (i.e. outdoor scenes). The TV also had a very hard time with human flesh. Skin looks almost clay-like and a little too orange in color. You can also see alternating wide bands on the screen adjusting brightness and contrast in darker scenes. It is quite distracting. My 7 year old Samsung LN46A650 LCD TV performs much better than the Vizio M471I-A2.Other issues: the sound is poor. It sounds like it is coming out of a tin can. You will need to get a sound bar or send it through a home theater system. To be fair, most new thin TVs have this problem. The remote is not very sensitive. You need to point it at the bottom left hand corner of the screen to get maximum responsiveness.I have heard so much about Vizio\u2019s rise in quality, but this experience was very disappointing. Maybe I got a defective Vizio M471I-A2 or the 47\u201d version in the M Series line is the under performer.

We decided to replace our 6 year old Samsung 63\" when all the pixels started dying on it.  Not being impressed with Samsung's longevity in our case, we wanted to try another brand.This TV's remote has already been heavily documented in reviews but I will start there by saying they aren't exaggerating -- it sucks.  You have to point the remote at the bottom left hand side of the TV to get it to activate.  The menus aren't bad but not overly convenient, especially the \"Picture\" menu, which you have to adjust on a frequent basis to get a decent picture quality depending on the source.I set the TV up per guidelines I found widely circulated on the Internet and was happy to see those modifications resolved the \"Soap Opera Effect\" this TV has in a BIG way - it makes everything look \"live\" like a soap opera and instills a 3D type effect even for shows that aren't 3D - very annoying!The biggest complaint I have is this - the blockiness and blurriness that occurs with any type of movement.  I've adjusted all the settings and while \"Smooth Motion\" and \"Noise\" controls help a bit, it does not entirely eliminate it.  I bought a 240 Hz TV specifically to AVOID this type of degradation but it's there in full force along with ghosting.  The colors tend towards greenish and the TV has 4 bright areas in each corner of the screen that are like someone is shining a dim light at the TV in those areas.  Not sure what that's all about.  As mentioned in other reviews, the screen is ULTRA reflective and if you're not going to be using it in a very dark room I would tell you that is reason enough to avoid this TV.  I use it in a media room with no windows and dimmable lights.You will most likely need to directly connect this TV to a wired Internet connection to get it setup - it would not connect to the internet over my WiFi until I did so.  It will most likely need to install updates to the apps when it connects or they will not work correctly - that was my experience.  I was able to get my Logitech Universal Remote to control the TV without too much effort.If you're trying to play games on it, you'll need to switch it to \"Game\" mode, as trying to play CoD in Standard mode will get you lots of erratic behavior and you won't be able to control the controller.  Game mode does work well thereafter and I noticed that I don't \"lag\" as much in CoD with this TV.As I said, I will be returning the TV.  The blockiness and digital artifacts/blurriness and lack of sharpness make this TV a major disappointment.  My last TV, the Samsung, was ultra sharp and the picture magnificent.  We were so disappointed when the pixels started dying.  Looks like it's back to Samsung for us, though.** UPDATE 1/26/2014 **Plan to take this TV back tomorrow, but tried watching the Pro Bowl on it tonight and had to turn it off.  There was so much blockiness, blurriness and digital artifacts in times of high motion (you know, like trying to watch a football game) that it was unwatchable.

Although I really never cared about Vizio (because they are made my LG) Every tv I have ever bought had been a Samsung. But this one really caught my eye for some reason. I had just finish building my custom pc for gaming and I was looking into a 32 inch monitor. I had my eye on a Samsung for about a month but didn't want to drop 600 bucks for a 32 inch set with 1080p 120mhz. Until I saw this one setting right next to the Samsung I was thinking of buying. I compared the 2 sets they both had the same video feed connected to them. I really could not tell the different between the 2 set except the price. The Vizio was 200 dollars cheaper. so I took a chance and bought it. After I bought it I was thinking about dropping the extra 260 dollars to get the Samsung and I almost did a few times before the return policy expired, but something told me inside just to keep this set and so I did. So far I have been very pleased with the led tv set. don't listen to the guy who says he has to sit a few inches away to read anything on the screen he must need glasses. I use this as a pc monitor and it works great for games. if your into saving some money I would recommend this buy over the Samsung.

After an extensive amount of research, I purchased the Vizio 40\" as it was going to be the most featured packed for the space I needed it to fit in. The item was going to be a gift for my wife on Christmas. The item was listed as brand new and for the money spent it was only $20.00 cheaper than the same one listed at Costco. I figured I was saving a bit which in these times is valuable to my budget. I notedt that the company listed as the shipper was One Stop Shop and figured that this was one of the many suppliers that Amazon uses. The TV arrived on time but on arrival the box looked questionable. The box showed signs of damage (dented and ding) and it was taped with a bright green non-factory tape. I opened the box and looked inside and everything appeared to be there but because it was a gift, I wasn't going to fully unwrap it. I told myself that I didn't buy a box, I bought a TV who cares what the box looked like. Lets just say when it was on wrapped on Christmas I was not impressed and embarrassed that didn't refuse it when I first saw the box. The TV was clearly used not brand new as advertised as there was scratches and marks all over the frame and stand. The instruction manual was photocopied, missing pages, and none of the registration paper work was present. Finally the TV looked like it was packed by someone who just finished eating a jelly donut as there was a mystery goo all over the screen, frame, and many of the goo marks were in the shape of hand prints. The only reason this rating got any stars at all was because of the return and refund process. Amazon is amazing when it came to getting it returned.

That price for a LED 240hz 3D Smart Wifi set you say. Sounds like a good deal with all those cool features doesn't it. Well, I am on my third one now. The first one wouldn't connect to internet at first, but after about 50 times redoing over and over it finally connection. Then the date wouldn't change off from 1970 for the year. That finally fixed itself too. The next thing was the volume bar got stuck on the screen when the volume was raised and it wouldn't turn off, or do anything. Had to unplug it from the socket. That was fixed. lastly, yesterday the tv kept turning itself off all by itself while you were watching a DVD disc. That was the last straw for me. I had purchased the 5 year warranty from best buy for only 119.99, but I figured if I took it back before two weeks, I wouldn't have to wait for it to get sent off for repair. So I got the last one they had left at this location for an even exchange. Took it home, hooked it all up, and then realized the plastic Vizio nameplate at the bottom of the screen was cracked and fell completely off when I touched it. How cheap is that. I thought it was iron tho at first, but its just the fake paint. These look like they aren't that heavy duty or durable for that matter. well, since that store was out, I had to call another store and find another one. I did, and then packaged this tv up and went to go get mumber 3. I didn't get to use set number 2 that much, because I noticed the crack right away, but I can say this one wouldn't connect to the internet either. So, I get set 3 home and this one immediately connects to the internet first try. Good sign I hope. So far so good.As for the picture. It looks great if its a dark or not well lit room. U don't want this tv near windows or bright light. it has a mirror like finish that just attracts glare. its pretty awful actually. I have seen the cheapest sets provide a better job of reducing glare than this supposedly $800 MSRP LED set. The picture really does look fantastic in darker rooms however, but if you cant use this in a room with windows, or a brighter room, than that is really sad and unacceptable at this price. Don't they test these things anymore? I am glad I took the 5 year warranty out on this M series tv. apparently quite a few have a lot of bugs in this whole series. It seems the previous models were better with less bugs. Shouldn't they be improving. There wasn't glare problems on previous models either, besides the bugs. What a stupid way to design a tv screen. Glare attracter.For the price I paid, I guess it is an ok deal if it will have no problems in the future. I honestly don't think its worth any more than that with all these problems it has. If u thinking about getting a vizio, wait until the next models come out for 2014. Leave the M series alone, because you may get stuck with a lemon, and if you don't, u will not be impressed with it's glare issues.I am just ok with my purchase and the price I paid. Do NOT pay $800 for this set please.If I have any problems after this, I am thankful I have the 5 year warranty to back me up, but I sure wouldn't get another M series if my set couldn't be repaired.

Fundamental problem was that the initial Vizio support rep I delt with right after purchase in July gave false information.  I'm sure he was unique, as my recent experience with their support has been excellent.  As covered below the initial Vizio support rep claimed that my new Vizio would not connect to internet as this Vizio is designed not to support WEP encryption.  That sounded nonsense.  As it turned out it was  nonsense.This set failed recently after 4 months, in November.  Bottom line, Vizio sent a support rep to my home and found necessary to replace both motherboard and WiFi card (small module).  TV then was immediately able to connect to internet disproving the claim by first (in July) Vizio support rep.  The tech who fixed set agreed that the claim that had been made about not supporting WEP was not true.  With new motherboard all is fine now.------------- original review below -----------I'm sufficiently irritated at some of the design logic of this Vizio M321i-A2 32-Inch 1080p 120Hz Smart LED HDTV to document my experiences with this model.I am a Vizio fan, with four Vizios, so am quite familiar with their products and can judge this one against the other three.Once set up, after hours at it, the picture quality is first class.  Excellent - But before anyone else buys this model I suggest you read on and then contact Vizio support prior to buying to insure that the smart TV functions will indeed work with your router set-up.Problem areas which I ran into during (and after) set-up:1) No hard copy manual2) Screws for stand (yes, simple, but ... )3) Inability to log into router4) Sun rises in East from Vizio support5) Default setting large black borders all sides 720 and 10806) Told TV cannot connect to internet (wrong)7) Programmed logic of TV Smart TV function design flaw - deliberate1) No hard copy manual:  It's available from the on-screen menu, which is not very convenient for use while trying to change settings, etc., which use the same screen as your source of instructions.  It is also available as .pdf on-line.  Would have been nice had they provided it with the purchase. Further, Vizio used to have beautiful large fold-out colored quick start guides which took you through the set-up great.  Now it's a small mini-manual, which is OK, except when you run into a non-trivial problem without a manual as back-up.2) Screws for stand: OK.  Simple, except for the first misleading step of using the \"Hex\" screws.  The pure Hex screws are the wrong ones for the first step.  You use the smaller, regular slotted screws, which have a mini-cross cut, making them almost Hex.  The wrong ones are the ones which are clearly Hex.  Trivial, but an unnecessary irritation.3) Inability to log into router:  Nothing trivial about this one.  This model Vizio is the first device, out of very many, which has not allowed me to link it to my router.  I couldn't understand what in the world was wrong.  Was I entering an error each time?  No.  I tried many times, very carefully.  \"Connection failed\" was the consistent explanation.  There is a design flaw here, not the first as covered below, as there was a way to connect to the router, but the menu did not provide the alternate path to do so from this point in the menu.  So ... I called Vizio support.4) Sun rises in East from Vizio support: The support rep was a good guy, altho we had some mild disagreements.  Too many times when I pointed out something I'd observed, I'd get a statement analogous to `the sun rises in the East and sets in the West, and the sky is blue.\"  Nothing at all relevant to my question.  My thoughts were `don't give this crap, I'm being specific here.'  I don't fault him, as he was trying, but it would have been better had he actually listened.5) Default setting large black borders all sides 720 and 1080:  This subject was not why I called support, but became obvious during our more than one hour conversation.  While trying to solve the non-connection problem I took the opportunity, while he was on the line, to tell him about the large black borders on all sides, i.e., small actual picture, for both 720 and 1080.  Sure I could have figured out how to correct this once I got to the manual or proper settings, but he was on the line, and the set was branded new, so I asked how to correct, and later I asked again, and then again two more times later.  The first three times, the response was \"it depends on the signal being sent from your provider.\"  Yes.  The provider sends the signal.  That's not the answer.  All my Vizios have the identical signal, and all are 1080p, and none have the black bars.  In fact, they all opened up first time with full screens, not mini-pictures.  TV sets have settings.  On my fourth try he pointed out the small rectangle on the new remote which allowed screen size settings.  Thanks, after four times.6) Told TV cannot connect to internet (wrong): Here we go.  This model Visio will not connect its Smart TV functions to certain router settings or configurations.  I just stated it more accurately than the support rep.  After more than an hour, he told me that, yes, I was connected to my router (finally), but had no internet connection, as the router \"is not giving the TV any bandwidth.\" ???  I was connected to the router.  And the router was connected to a very high speed internet connection and working fine.  But I had \"no internet connection.\"  This was a new one to me, so I thanked him sincerely for all his time and help, and we ended the long session.Then I plugged in my Roku, immediately was connected to the internet, accessed Netflix, and downloaded and saw a movie, all through the TV with \"no internet connection.\"  So, see no. 7 below.7) Programmed logic of TV Smart TV function design flaw - deliberate:  From above, obvious TV does have internet connection.  However, the Smart TV function  itself does not connect to the internet due to a deliberate design decision, not to support certain router configurations.  I understand the reason for this decision, as the rep explained why it was done (call Vizio support to find out, as it's their decision, and it's not documented in anything which I received with the set.)  It is a serious design flaw nevertheless, for this set is advertised and sold as a Smart TV.  For most people it will be OK.  Not for all, and that's the problem.Being told that it does not have internet access was simply, flatly wrong.  The statement should have been that the TV's Smart functions cannot connect, even though the TV itself is connected.  And, blaming it on the router not providing \"any bandwidth\" to the TV is flat nonsense.  Not the fault of the router.  It's a fault of the deliberate programming of the Smart function, and to me, that is a deliberate design flaw.I've still tried to get this Smart TV to work, but still failed.  As soon as I OK the selection of my router, I'm taken off the connection menu back to a TV channel, and still have no Smart connection, although the Roku sails right through the TV WiFi connection immediately.Most people will have no such problems, but more than a few will, so that's why I've taken this time to vent a bit.", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Small", "Author": "Misty L.

Luckly, VIZIO has a 1 year warranty on this product so we got it fixed free of charge. It sucked though that we were without a TV for about 3-4 weeks, but they were very helpful. Don't get me wrong this TV produces a beautiful image that is unparalleled to similar 27-32\" TV's on the market (in this general price range), but I just do not feel that VIZIO puts as good of quality components into their products. Maybe its because this is a cheaper TV, I do not know, but I would recommend anyone who is thinking of buying this TV to just go out and spend a little bit more and buy a Samsung or a Sony; therefore, you won't have to deal with the headache like we had too or knowing that it may fail in 2 years once the warranty is up and then you will have wished you had spent the extra $40.

Not great.- Picture uniformity and light bleed suffers a quite a bit.Especially on a dark screen with just a few bright areas. I notice it especially when I have it connected to my computer and the light bleeds from the sides following my mouse cursor.- Smart Dimming performance needs a lot more refinement to reduce light bleeds and blooming.- But when viewing pictures and motion scenes, you will hardly notice.Compatibility with bright rooms- The screen is more polished than matte.  You will experience a few more reflections with this TV.  My uncle ended up buying thicker blinds for his windows.Sound- Sound is above average.  Bass response is good.  Mid's and high's are clear.Apps- Apps are slow and often freeze and have to wait extremely long buffer times when streaming videos.WiFi- Supported.  I think the WiFi device may be the reason for the bad experience when streaming movies over the internet.TV remote- TV is slow to respond to the remote.  Sometimes, you have to push the buttons in excess of three times with a clear line of site view to the TV before it responds.  No, the batteries were not low in the remote.  You cannot use the remote to control other HDMI devices.3D- Passive 3D technology is used on this TV.  It works.  Not as good as Active 3D.  The glasses are extremely fragile.  The polarized lenses are made from a thin sheet of plastic that scratches very easily.  You will need to replace them often if you have kids that like watching 3D content.SimulView- Not supported.  If you want to learn more about SimulView, you will have YouTube it.  SilmuView is currently more for gamers.  But in the future, I hope that they incorporate it into cable and satellite TV so that the wifey and I can watch different programming with one TV and be able to send two streams of audio wirelessly to separate headsets.  That would be cool.Overall Impression- Would I buy this TV?  No.- Reason to buy this TV.  Unless you a videophile, you will most-likely not notice the shortcomings of this TV. Picture isn't perfect, but price is for this size.My uncle bought this TV from a local vendor.

Picture is great.  Apps work great.  Using the ARC with a sony receiver and a sony blu ray player and HDMI control.  And that works great.  The TV finds the receiver and turns it on automatically.  When you turn on the blu ray player, the TV switches inputs to show dvd automatically.  Little tricks that my family really like as not everyone is super skilled managing components in our system.Only negatives I have found at all is that the remote does not seem to have much of a range.  My Universal remote and my CAble box remote both control TV from 10 feet farther away than the remote that came with the TV.And the Amazon Vizio App doesn't have the watchlist available so if we don't watch a prime movie all the way through, we have to do a search to go back and watch the rest of the movie.  not a big deal but still kind of annoying that a command present when you go to prime on Amazon, is not there when you access Amazon Prime on the Vizio TV.I actually had to buy this TV from a retail store because I first bought it from Amazon but it never showed up at my house.Tracking showed it to have arrived at the distribution center but then next thing I know, Amazon is emailing me telling me it has been lost in shipping and they are refunding me.  And when I asked UPS for an investigation, they said they couldn't tell me anything about it because I was not the shipper.  I would love to know how it is that it showed up on their tracking as being in the distribution center in my town and then mysteriously disappeared.  I have a feeling that someone else got to watch the weekend's games on the TV that I bought.That was really annoying and I am disappointed that Amazon would not ever explain to me what had happened, but bottom line, as far as the TV is concerned, it is excellent.I bought a second one in the 32 inch size.
