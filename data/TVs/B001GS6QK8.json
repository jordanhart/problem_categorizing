Our only complaint, and it is a small one, is that the screen is darker when viewed from below.  You see, we put the tv on top of our refrigerator in the kitchen.We tilted the base (with a piece of 2x4) so it looks great from the table.  And the speakers are in the front, so the sound comes to us and not to the spiders behind the fridge.It came on-time, no problems.  This is a great buy.", "Date": "January 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "size consideration", "Author": "X. QI \"propeller head\"", "ReviewID": "R35RKMLPOUK1JP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this 22'' one today to replace my old 20'' analog one. I am generally happy so far with the quick setup, also the clear audio due to the front-facing speakers. However I realized that in order to view 4:3 programming without cropping and distortion, the picture is smaller than the one on my old 20'' TV. Upon some calculation I can now share this conversion formulae with you: if you are looking to buy a HDTV (widescreen TV) to replace your analog one (squarish TV), and want to maintain the SAME image size of 4:3 programming contents on your new widescreen TV as on your old squarish one, WITHOUT distortion and cropping, then the size of the HDTV (its diagonal screen dimension) should be 1.224 times that of the analog TV. For instance, to replace my old 20'' analog TV and keep the same image size for 4:3 contents, I would have to buy a 1.224x20=24.477'' one. Of course there is no such size, but you get the idea: buy one bigger than 24''! This formulae works regardless of the size of the original TV.", "Date": "March 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Blondie's Bistro", "Author": "Theresa C.

Sony products never die so I retired my Sony TV of 30 years and fully expect the same performance of this new baby.

Leung", "ReviewID": "R2HBJDLN1XF6MT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this model in end Dec 2008. Main reasons of purchase were the profile is good looking, and it's a Sony TV set.  However, besides agreeing with the previous reviewer's comment about color inaccuracy, I also found these cons:. The display is darker than desired - it's not possible to set it bright enough without making it over-saturated.. The tuner is noiser than expected - my low-cost USB Tuner used on a three-year old PC has less noise.. The viewing angles are diappointingly narrow, especially the horizontal one.. More clearer picture is desire - at times it will look like a very old analog TV set -- not sure if that's because of the particular TV programs themselves.I had been using Sony analog TV's for many years, and they were very good. I'm disappointed on this Sony LCD TV especially it's more expensive than other brands of the same size.", "Date": "March 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV!", "Author": "Ridgley Resources", "ReviewID": "R24T1VOP9WFVK5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This 22\" TV just fit the bill for the space in our kitchin.

But after I have tried it, I found the color is not that accurate and is over saturated. Faces on TV are redder than they should be, no matter how I adjust it.

I was afraid it would not make it in one piece, especially since I did not insure it.  It made it and I love it, in particular the feature of connecting my computer to it and using it as a monitor.  I recently bought a netbook computer and I need the larger screen to log into my class, participate in conferences and do my homework.

It connected easily to my cable system (Comcast in Seattle). The automatic set up routine found all of the unscrambled channels that Comcast offers.
