I wanted the best 42 inch I could get for around $550.00.  Needles to say, there is a bunch of TV's that fit this criteria.  They all look good in the store and all the specs are pretty much the same.  Lo and behold, I saw this Vizio for 480.00 at Amazon.  Crossed my fingers and took a chance.  This Vizio is Great.  Easy to set up, just the right amount of connections in the rear, and what a great picture.  In my small dark living room, TV programs VIA antenna is super and my DVD's never looked so good, not to mention my Blu-Ray's. Fantastic.  Some people might not be satisfied with only 2 HDMI plugs, but I run everything thru an AV receiver.  So two HDMI is more than enough for me.  I don't play video games so the 60Hz refresh rate is fine for me.  I watch a lot of sports, but I have not noticed any shadows or trailer effects.  I have had this set for more than a month and I have not had any problems.  Don't be turned off by the low price.  Sometimes buying HD tv's can be a crap shoot, but from my experience, you won't go wrong with this Vizio.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wouldnt buy any other brand", "Author": "gingergrl88", "ReviewID": "R2Z2BBBPETU6B0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this exact tv from Walmart.

The poor sound of LED's CAN be overcome by hooking up a sound bar or set of 2.1 pc speakers...but I chose not to go the \"addon to make it right\" route for this one.

Destrempes \"cedest\"", "ReviewID": "R154SS00UEXVIU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We purchased this around 8-10 months ago (not through Amazon - for televisions I like to be the delivery method  :)  ).  It is fairly solid television.  Reasonable set of controls, reasonable set of inputs, etc.  I run an XBox 360 and our cable box through different video inputs.  There is only one \"complaint\" we would have...however it really isn't one that should surprise anyone: the sound quality is average (at best).  The main thing we have noticed about sound is that it can be very difficult to have dialogue be loud enough to clearly hear without, in an instant when there is a change in the action or music, being blasted out of the couch.  Most of the time we can run the volume at a setting of 18 or so.  In some movies/television shows we find ourselves turning it up to 30+ so the dialog is clear (and the characters are not whispering or being quiet or anything of the sort) - it seems to be more prevalent of an issue when there is significant background noise/activity so it is if the mix levels are \"off\".  So, we have found we need to keep the remote handy and, depending on the movie or television show, be ready to adjust the volume up (for dialogue heavy scenes) and then back down when the action (or whatever) is about to begin.  It's annoying...although we have become used to it.  Again - it isn't all of the time...just enough to be annoying...but not enough I have yet done anything about it.  I need to stop being lazy and pick up external speakers/etc. so we can control it through another mechanism and bypass the built-in speakers.  :/", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "JMF5505", "ReviewID": "R3SFT6BEL5CX3B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "TV is great.

The picture quality is excellent, the speakers are typical TV speakers (they are OK quality, but at least they face Forward not backward like some) good enough to use for watching movies and such if you're not too picky. For me i use an AV receiver for all my audio so i don't use the built-in speakers. That being said, the sound that the TV outputs to the AV receiver is much better than my last TV; i could really tell the difference. It's easy to hear movie dialogue without turning up the volume too loud, the SRS surround is great.Pros:  - The price was right, basically was a 42\" for the price of a 40\"  -  Has good video/audio settings including a customizable equalizer.  -  Energy efficient (if that matters to someone)  -  Looks sleek and has a fairly low profile with decently thin borders (about 1 & 1/2 inches on the sides and top).Cons: - It doesn't have a ton of connections (2 HDMI, 1 VGA, 1 Comp, 1 AV out, 1 RCA, 1 USB, 1 coaxial cable) I think the new version might only have 1 HDMI.  - The USB seems to be used ONLY for viewing pictures, would have been nice to be able to play movie and music files from it.Conclusion: So far I am impressed by the video quality, now i just hope it will last me many years and it will be the perfect TV.

The best thing you can hope for is that this problem will happen immediately, so that the company will replace the entire unit (which is the only real fix for it).I bought this television in July of 2012. Flash forward to the beginning of September 2013 -- a vertical line two pixels wide (about the width of a fine-tip Sharpie mark) appears about a third of the way across the screen. It's diagnosed by customer service as a 'panel issue'. The unit is out of warranty by two months, and I am informed that all they can do is provide a phone number to an authorized repair center -- and that to replace the panel on this (originally) $428 TV, the cost will be $725.To summarize:* Vizio TVs have a widely known defect that the company will not address or make any effort to correct after the 1 year warranty has passed.* The only repair solution costs nearly twice what the TV itself does.* If you do buy this TV, be aware that there is a very good chance that it will start developing permanent and highly visible lines for which the only solution is replacement.", "Date": "September 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV, Great Price", "Author": "mbellmyer", "ReviewID": "R2JWVQ3O1WYZZT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The 42\" Vizio is great.
