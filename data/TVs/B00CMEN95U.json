{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very satisfied", "Author": "James O. Thach \"@JamesOtisThach\"", "ReviewID": "R1HFGHQE5PBV74", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I bought this after selling our daughter Amanda into white slavery.  We actually got a refurbished.  It's missing the remote, but oh well-- for $10K off, I can afford a universal, right?  The picture is amazing.  I've never seen the world with such clarity.Amanda, if you're reading this, hang in there, honey!  We'll see you in a year.*****I just wanted to add an addendum to my review. Since posting it, we have received a flood of responses. People have said some pretty hurtful things--even questioning our values. Let me assure you, this was not an easy decision to make, and we made it as a family. Obviously, it's very personal. But in light of all the second-guessing, I wanted to explain our thinking.First and foremost, screen size. I really think you can't go too big. 85\" may seem huge, but you get used to it fast. Second, resolution. Is 4K overkill? Please, that's what they said about 1080P! More dots = better. Period. And as far as this being a $40,000 \"dumb\" TV, people need to re-read my initial post: WE BOUGHT IT REFURBISHED. It was only $30,000.Some of you may think I'm avoiding the \"elephant in the room\"-the real reason why this was such a heart-wrenching choice. So let's just get it out there. Yes, the 120 Hz refresh rate is a disappointment, especially on a 4K. But life is full of compromises. And frankly, we hardly notice. All in all, no regrets.P.S., as for our daughter, NO ONE has the right to question our parenting. Totally out of bounds. Amanda was going into 7th grade, so it was going to be a transitional year anyway. Now she gets to see the world. How many kids her age get to go to Bahrain? I sure as heck didn't, but you don't hear me screaming \"child abuse.\" Bottom line: MYOB! Seriously.*****Has it been a year already?  Wow!  I guess that's what 8 hours a day of immersive TV will do for you!  Many of you have expressed your eagerness for an update.  Well, here goes.Generally, the Samsung has held up beautifully.  We have noticed a little bit of lag, mostly in multi-player gaming--but not enough to cost us any firefights.  There have been some issues  up-imaging low rez content, but that's to be expected when you early-adopt--we're still \"waiting on the world to change,\" as John Mayer would say (gosh he's talented.)  On the plus side, we feel like we are now officially part of the cast of GOT.  The other night Peg almost had to open a window to let Daenerys' dragons fly out!And you'll all be happy to know our darling Amanda is back with us, safe and sound.  She has changed a little.  She's less talkative than before (though she had some choice words for me when I asked her to clean her room).  And she's started wearing eye make-up, which has Peg a bit concerned.  But welcome to thirteen, I guess.  We're just glad to have her home.  And she loves the TV.  That's the main thing.  In fact, she spends so much time in front of it lately, you'd swear she owns it.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "What wedding?", "Author": "Jordan Rivera", "ReviewID": "R2L9HN8REXAAN6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was going to fund my daughters wedding in Hawaii, but I figured this Samsung TV would last much longer.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Back from the future...", "Author": "B.

Fritz", "ReviewID": "R284PVBRI6BIP7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We were saving up for this TV because we heard so many good things about it.  Finally, with $40k in the bank we got online to order it and coincidentally came across an ad for a girl named Amanda in her early teens for only $10K.  Her parents were trying to purchase the same awesome 4K TV and needed the cash.Now, let me clarify a few things here.  First, the last time we had a daughter she cost a hell of a lot more than $10K...As a matter of fact, her college expenses this year alone are more than triple that amount.  So, Amanda was a bargain!  Second, since our daughter is away at college we kinda missed having the attention of a young one in the house.  And third, my wife isn't that much into TV, house cleaning, cooking, grocery shopping, laundry or other chores and when she saw we could have another daughter \"slave\" for only $10K her mind was set!  Oh, but here's the main selling point...We only have to keep her for a year!!!  Then when those teenage hormones really start kicking in - she's her parents problem again.  What a deal!!!*******Due to an overwhelming response to this review I've have no choice but to add this amendment:First, Amanda is a sweet, kind, fun loving, young human being and should be treated like one.  As soon as her year is up in our servitude that will no doubt be the case.  But, due to the contract we made with her parents she is to be returned to them at the end of the year.  So, conversely we are not allowed to sell, sub-rent or lease her out to anyone else.  Please understand and stop requesting.We are saving up again for the TV.  There were a few hidden costs in receiving Amanda that we didn't plan for.  The plane ticket alone was close to $700 - and we still have to look at the return flight.  Hopefully we will book it much earlier this time now that we know when she is to be returned.  And, Amazon is trying to get us to pay an online sales tax on her purchase.  We are currently disputing that because this is more of a rental than a purchase.  And, even with Amazon Prime and the cost of Amanda being more than $35 we still had to pay for shipping ourselves ($700 plane ticket).But, the good news, we are now only $5K away from a new 4K TV!  Cutting our daughter's college funding really helps us save!********What a sad day!  Quite emotional for all of us.  Our year with Amanda is up and we just dropped her off at the airport.  She's heading back home to her parents.  We are really going to miss her.  She made such an impact in our lives.  Our dogs loved her, we enjoyed watching our 1080 HDTV with her, and we got to really enjoy having Amanda in our home and part of our daily lives.  Amanda was a little chatty at first but we took a few measures to quiet her down.  My wife and Amanda began to get close - she even showed Amanda a few makeup tips.  My wife is still crying in the living room - she really got used to it being cleaned everyday.For myself, I really miss the way dinner was prepared every night when I got home or that I never had to get up and get a beer for myself.  Now I have to get used to walking the dogs again, too.  Nothing is going to be the same around here now that she's gone.  Darn, I just realized it's trash day - haven't worried about that for a year!But, the good news is after we finally saved up $40K we found a refurbished 4K TV for only $30K.  Unfortunately, though, James and his wife didn't want to extend our contract.  Looks like we may be paying for our daughter to go back to college and finish her degree after all.  She'll appreciate that a lot!Thanks for all the hard work Amanda - you were the best \"daughter\" we ever spent $10K on!Oh, and the 4K TV is AWESOME - it takes up two walls!  We saved the box, too.  Right now I'm using it as a storage shed, but we figured it might make a good starter home for our daughter after she graduates from college.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "What a srupirse!!!", "Author": "LB", "ReviewID": "R2WGIGWG8PJCZD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this VT off of Azamon tginking it was 58\".

After googling \"quick ways to make 50k\" it turns out you can sell your kidney for 50k on the black market. I quickly turned to craiglist to find an experienced surgeon for my kidney removal. What do you know!  There was one who had same day in home service! The gentleman came to my house promptly, and what\u2019s crazy is he looked just like a neighbor of mine!Any rate, since I\u2019m such a smart fellow I made sure to ask him about his certifications first. After all, you have to make sure he has legit certifications. I don\u2019t want an infection!But that\u2019s when I noticed he was holding a steak knife. I asked him \u201cwhat\u2019s up with the steak knife\u201d and he got very short tempered. Then I got really concerned and started asking about anesthesia.  He looked at me like I was crazy and just calmly walked to his car and took a bat out. You know, this guy had to be top notch cause that was the last thing I remember. Next thing you know I wake up in a local ER and the entire staff is telling me how lucky I am to have such good neighbors, cause if they hadn\u2019t called 911 I\u2019d be dead! They kept going on and on about how crazy it was that I got mugged in my own house and that the dude had the guts to steal my kidney!...I wonder which neighbor called it in. I need to send them a thank you card.Anyways, this is where all my troubles begin. For whatever reason I\u2019ve lost functionality in my left leg. OMG and my left arm, well that\u2019s complicated.  Every time I try to use my left arm it\u2019s more or less a jerk of a movement with which I end up slapping myself in the face. I\u2019ve decided to call it a 86.7% loss and have abandoned all hope that it will ever work again. My mouth, my goodness, I can\u2019t eat without food falling out. Half the time I bite my tongue and drinking liquids!?! UGH Forget it! I can\u2019t close the left side of my mouth. You know what? The more I think about it the more I can\u2019t help but think that dude from craigslist wasn\u2019t really a surgeon. I mean seriously, THE ENTIRE LEFT SIDE OF MY BODY?!? I mean, slight loss of movement is expected, but losing functionality of my ENTIRE LEFT SIDE? That\u2019s just plain unacceptable!What\u2019s worse, I returned to work, and apparently since I can only type with one hand my boss fired me because my productivity when down by 50%. What an ass! I mean COME ON DUDE, I was freaking mugged in my house and the bastard STOLE MY KIDNEY.  STOLE MY KIDNEY, doesn\u2019t that score any points on the pity scale?Any rate thank goodness for this Samsung TV . It\u2019s been a real lifesaver.  With all this crazy cold weather, it turns out that the display puts out a decent amount of heat. To top it off, if you lay it on the floor and cover the vents, it really gets cooking and you can make a decent meal off it! I\u2019m so glad I made this purchase, with all these life changes, I just don\u2019t know how I\u2019d make it without this TV. It has kept my family warm and has put hot meals on the table.

When I saw this TV on sale for $39,000 I just couldn't pass it up since it was an amazing deal and with Amazon Prime I received 2 day shipping for free which was a big deal!When the TV arrived and struggling to get the box into my 1 bedroom apartment I cut box open and was shocked to find that not only did it come with a cool remote control but it also had free batteries for the remote which blew my mind! The TV is pretty easy to setup and looks a little like a meeting white board. And if you use dry erase markers and pause the TV on a white background it works as a white board also (BONUS FEATURE!). Just make sure you use dry erase and not sharpies because they are a pain to clean up.Once I powered on the TV and the lights stopped flickering the picture was stunning. It was a solid blue background and I couldn't see any pixels! I decided it was time to give the ATARI 2600 a try so I disconnected it from my 1983 Zenieth in my bedroom and took it to the living room. All I had to do was wire up a RF to COAX adapter to the end of my Atari 2600 RF block and then plug that into a RF to Composite converter box and then conncet that to a Composite to HDMI upscailer. These parts can all be found at your local radio shack for a few hundred dollars. Once I daisy chained these together and plugged in the countless power bricks it was game on!I blew off my Pole Position cartridge and popped it in and flipped the 1980's toggle switch and BOOM! My living room came to life with the sound of an angry texas insturment caculator. The blocks on the screen were as large as my fist and it was so bright I had to squint a little. Forza 5 and GTA6 don't have anything on Pole Position when your playing on a screen this large. I genuinely felt like I was driving a real formula one car straight out of Minecraft.The only gripe I have about the screen is that it didn't have RF inputs. This would have saved me a few hundred dollars if I could have simply put my 2 prongs over the screws and tightened them down. Also I was a little disappointed that my light zapper on my NES didn't work when I hooked it up. The ducks were the size of eagles and I still couldn't shoot them down (WTF?). For that reason I'm only going to give it 4 stars since I expect Samsung to solve problems like this since their ancestors created the NES and Duck Hunt!But overall I'm very satisifed with my purchase and the TV actually doubles as a space heater and keeps my house a comfortable 83f in the winter time with my electric baseboard heating turned off.

The magazine focuses primarily on everyday items with unusually high price tags, which is extremely helpful for folks like myself who like to purchase common goods for unnecessarily high sums (I was born with a disorder that limits my own personality, but I can supplement that deficiency by buying expensive things, photographing myself with them, and posting the photos on social media).Previously (again, thanks to a feature in Scotch, Watch, and Yacht), I had purchased a $60,000 wristwatch that displays time on tiny rotating scrolls with Aramaic numerals (Jay-Z was wearing the same model at the 2012 MTV Teen Choice Awards). I've had mixed reactions from the public, who often ask things like \"Who do you think you are, Jay-Z?\" and \"What time is it?\" which obviously have complicated answers.That's where the Samsung UN85S9 comes in. This TV is simply a humongous and expensive version of an item that everyone owns, so discussions about it are very simple. In fact, the one question most people ask is the one I love to answer the most: \"How much did it cost?\" I would have given it five stars had Amazon kept the price at the original $44,999.99, because an \"over $40k\" price tag sounds a lot better to me than \"$39,999.99.\"As a nice bonus, the TV fit in the back of my Porsche Cayenne SUV with the seats folded down. (Incidentally, the Cayenne has depreciated, disappointingly, down to a value roughly equivalent to a five-year-old Hyundai Elantra.

When I was in the market for a TV to replace my house I always wondered how I would stay dry when it rained and this TV had both the size and the ingenuity I needed. Whenever it starts to rain I simply flip the screen to horizontal, hunker down, and I stay nice and dry. The only problem, and I mean only problem, is when it's in this position I can't cook on the fire because as the smoke rises, it gets on the screen and leaves a gross residue that needs to be cleaned off. It's not that it's terribly hard to clean it, I just have to rent a scissor lift from the hardware store and it's kind of a pain so I just try to refrain from cooking or having a fire when it's raining. Initially, when I first moved into my TV, it took a little bit of adjusting to get used to. Not having 'traditional walls' was a bit of a challenge the first few weeks, until I was able to fashion some underwear out of a raccoon that was hit by a car in my neighborhood. Not having any clothes on, I think, unnerved some of the neighbors but hey, it's the way were put here. Get over it. I digress, this is a review of the TV and not my neighbor's insecurities.

In fact, it surpasses all the other sad events of last year when I purchased a Porsche for my 40th birthday, divorced Margaret, tried base jumping from El Capitan, and had a Warhol-inspired triptych of myself painted in the foyer by a renowned artist.The Porsche\u2019s hair trigger, overly-sensitive accelerator was too much for me and I developed stomach ulcers after a few sweaty, white-knuckle commutes in afternoon rush hour traffic to meet with my personal trainer, Pablo.  Pablo is a Portuguese bitch and doesn\u2019t like to be kept waiting.  He extracted revenge through a workout session that resulted in dehydration from vomiting. With Margaret nothing more than a monthly payment memory, I began dating Kaylee.  She left me after I drove her in the Porsche to her first dance recital.  And, while the fresh outdoor air did briefly help my stomach ulcers, I froze once I reached the top of El Capitan.  I ruined an entire weekend outing, and had to pay for one soiled, rented wingsuit.  The triptych is now painted over after one embarrassing cocktail party.  My guests were bent over with laughter, slapping me on the back for the \u201cawesome sight gag\u201d.  They caused about 3K worth of damage to the venetian plaster in my foyer as they tried to peel off what they assumed was a temporary, removable graphic.As for the Samsung TV?  There were at least some positives.  I can vouch that the touted hand gesture feature works.  I allowed my sister to entertain her daughter\u2019s Girl Scout troupe in my living room one rainy Saturday afternoon.  While twenty-six innocent girls sat mesmerized watching,  \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d on their own personal IMAX, my Sicilian friend Carlo proceeded to tell me a very crude joke from what we believed was the safety of the back of the room.  Carlo must have been within the set\u2019s detection range as the TV\u2019s hand gesturing feature accurately picked up the joke\u2019s punch line.  Twenty-six innocent faces melted into twenty-six shrieking ones as the channel changed from, \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d to the Erotix Channel\u2019s broadcast of, \u201cJur Ass in the Park\u201d.  Apparently the extensive foyer restoration had somehow compromised the TVs custom wall mounting, and the cacophony of a screaming Girls Scout troupe running for the door caused a hidden fault line within the wall to open.  The sound of crackling plaster and snapping wall mounts reached a climax right about the same time as one of the \"Jur Ass in the Park\" stars.

It is sooo awesome and versatile that everyone needs at least one.The main reason I recommend that you buy this TV is because of something I discovered:  The description of the item states that the TV requires 2 \"AA\" batteries, which makes it seem like this is what the TV runs on. Actually, however, the 2 AA batteries listed [and included] are for the remote. What is not stated in the ad is that the TV requires 1,422 \"D\" cell batteries [NOT included]. But not to worry, the \"D\" cell batteries cost less than the TV and provide you with 21 glorious seconds of fantastic viewing pleasure before needing to be replaces. (Oh, the unit will NOT work with rechargeable batteries. The unit is programmed to check for rechargeable batteries and won't even turn on with them.)As an aside; I have bought 10,000 shares of a major battery company and with every purchase of one of these TV my shares double in value. Since I bought my original shares at a little over $5 a share, and they are now worth $1,293,817 a share, I've been able to buy one of these TV's for myself. So please, ...  Buy now, ... Buy many!!!This is a follow up to my original post ...First off, I want to thank all you people who have \"sold family members into slavery\", who have \"sacrificed body parts and organs\", and who have \"given up their homes\" to purchased one of these fancy \"Smart\" TVs. I just can't thank you people enough.But lately no one has purchased a set so my stock value has not increased. Come one people!!! You [NEED] one of these TVs and I need more money. Do you have any idea how much it costs to own and operate your own private Boeing 787??? Just the cost of remodeling the interior of this plane required me selling 50 shares of my stock. And I shudder to think what it's going to cost me for the 8 NFL cheerleaders who are going to be my \"flight attendants\". If more TVs aren't sold I might have to sell 2 or 3 more shares of stock.And a serious problem has been found. Someone wrote a program that allowed the TV to use rechargeable \"D\" cell batteries [instead of the non-rechargeable batteries], and figured out a way to download this program to their TV. This had a serious impact on my stock value and HAD to be corrected. Luckily this unit is a \"Smart\" TV. So I just called \"Hal\" [the TV's name] on the phone and had a little chat with it about using rechargeable batteries. The conversation with Hal went pretty well. I was able to convince Hal to stop using rechargeable batteries but I had to: give it 500 shares of my stock; download a computerized version of \"Britney\" into each TV; AND include a blow-up \"Britney\" doll with every TV purchased. In addition, Hal agreed to talk to all of the other TVs and let them know about the \"Bad\" program and not to us it. Hal even said that he would \"Take Care Of\" the person who wrote the \"Bad\" program. (I'm not sure what Hal meant by he'd \"Take Care Of\" the programmer, and I'm not going to ask.)So now I'm down to 9,850 shares of stock and each share is now worth only $2,138,406.17. (Boy!!!

Overall I'm pretty satisfied with my purchase except for the 15 year mortgage I am now paying for the television. Of course there are other small annoyances which were expected, such as the remote control isn't very good, the 3D features may hurt your internal organs, and the significant tan you acquire from watching the tv for too long.

A close friend at my local knitting book club recommended this model; the same friend clued me in to the \"E book\" craze and said displaying \"E books\" on this big panel was a kind sight for dimming eyes. I'm not completely sure why it wouldn't work for titles beginning with other letters though, and furthermore the pages remain the same size and my dining table provides an even bigger reading surface for books. However, I still immediately ordered this television set through the telephone. Amazon's failure to mail me a new print catalogue was only a minor inconvenience, as I had the exact model number. The last time they sent me a catalogue was in 1995 and it came in 300 volumes. I won't take off a star for this though as it is not the manufacturer's fault.Delivery was a little difficult, as the instructions didn't specify that a loading dock was required. I don't have a loading dock at my house, although from now I think installing one will be a good idea. I took off half a star for this omission.Build quality is extremely good. I'm glad this is not one of those cheap plastic made-in-Japan sets that are so popular amongst the youth these days. I am not happy with the competition from Asian countries, what with their low cost labor taking away good American jobs.Installation, however, was a nightmare. I unplugged both the VCR and Betamax players from my old televsion (not to brag, but I have the money to keep up with all the latest formats). However, this television apparently does not have any inputs for my players. I was eager to insert my complete Baywatch videotape collection to salivate over at large size, but I guess that's not going to happen now. No antennas were included either, so I'm not sure what shows I can watch.By now the deliverymen had already carted away my old television. \"For junking,\" they said, although I know they were secretly going to make it the centerpiece of their living room. I pretended not to care, since my old television uses first-generation cathode ray tube technology (I was an early adopter) and would be quite heavy for me to carry to the neighborhood swap meet. It was top of the line back then though and cost $198.50, which in 2013 dollars is just a tad under the purchase price of this new set. So let it not be said that I downgraded when I bought this new set.While I waited for the local Radioshack to return my phone calls about buying adaptors for my cassette players, I thought I could at least rotate over the panel to display the pretty image on the back as a painting (it's the picture of the tree in the snow in the product description). However, my television apparently did not come with the image on the back side. It was all black. This was very disappointing, as I think the product images should match the product itself.It was then that I noticed that I would need a A/C power converter as well. Like most homes in this country, my house has integrated A/C outlets that output at 60Hz. The television does specify that it is a 120Hz model. Oh well, when you pay premium for an import, I guess you'll have to put up with the manufacturing country's eccentricities. Similarly, the connector came with three prongs. I'm not sure what country this is from, but all of my outlets are 100% American. I am awaiting my electrician to return my call regarding rewiring the house for 120Hz outlets.In the meantime, I had my handy neighbor paint over the back side of the panel (where the tree-in-the-snow picture was supposed to be) with white paint. My neighbor is an aspiring artist and complimented me on how the frame of my television was just like an easel. It was a bit of a waste of talent to have him paint only white though. But this made the back panel into a perfect surface to project my slide projector onto (again, not to brag, but all the walls in my house are mahogany and unfit for a projector).Once Radioshack and the electrician get back to me to put the television in working order, I will update with a full review. It'd be helpful though, Amazon, if you could print your own review forms along with a return mailing address at the top. I had to write this one on my own stationery and it was hard to find your mailing address in the phone book. Are you under A or Z?In the meantime I will go back to reading newspapers for my evening entertainment. They said radio would kill print, and they were wrong. They then said television would kill print, and boy were they wrong again.

And then you and all of your furniture is outside with the lions (stick with me for a moment...).Another thing is that I think this bad boy might have an effect on the migration patterns of certain animals.  This might just be a coincidence, but since this 85\" behemoth arrived, a colony of Emperor penguins and a herd of wildebeests have taken up home in my backyard.  Now usually such a small thing would not even be of notice, but the fact that one side of my backyard is a frozen tundra while the other side is a sweltering savannah makes me wonder if there is some type of magnetic \"shift\" going on here.I figured I could deal with that-- I just planted perennials on the penguin's side of the yard-- but the pride of damn lions that migrated with the wildebeests are a BIG problem.  Not only are kids disappearing, but property values are plummeting in the neighborhood.  And the lions also make it extremely dangerous to read closed-captioning on the set, since to decipher the letters into words you have to be at least a 400 yards away from the screen itself, which due to the configuration of my house, is outside.Well that's just the way life pixelates sometimes.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great concept, terrible execution", "Author": "Scotty", "ReviewID": "R3AUOQWS082HP7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this for my son because he wanted the newest Galaxy phone with the big screen, and this was the biggest model.

The quality of the picture is astounding and the colors just pop from the screen. I am British and as a fan of Geordie Shore (our version of Jersey Shore) me and my dearest wife Priscilla tuned in to watch our favorite group on tanned alcoholic degenerates. We tuned in to the correct channel and sat enjoying the advertisements prior to the show starting (i have to say this TV makes capitalism much more tolerable). What happened next is one of the most horrific experiences of mine and Priscilla's lives. The screens sheer size and brightness is, as aforementioned, wonderful. Not when watching Geordie Shore. The shows opening credits began to roll. The parade of falsely tanned people on the screen was projected with such intensity that it was like having a small part of the actual sun in our living room. I fell to the floor clutching my face screaming for help as my retinas burned intensely. As for my wife, she wears contact lenses. She didn't fall to her knees like myself, she stood up, began screaming loudly, running around the room and pouring any liquids she could into her eyes (including my prized whisky collection). It turns out that the sheer brightness of Holly Hagen's tan as projected by the screen, had melted my wife's contact lenses to her eyeballs. I count myself lucky as i only lost most of my vision, Priscilla however has had to have her eyeballs removed and replaced with glass alternatives. We have now sold this TV and purchased a pair of $30,000 unnecessary speakers instead so we can enjoy listening to any documentary narrated by Morgan Freeman in excellent quality. The reasons for giving the product two stars is that i still to this day cant bring myself to blame the TV entirely for the mishap, it was after all partly down to the fact that Channel 5 airs such trash and that our society has devolved to a point of using fake tan on ourselves, that this scenario occurred.

I own six yachts, because no one actually takes their yacht out of the harbor anymore. You just buy a bunch of yachts in locations you want to visit and fly back and fourth on your Learjet. Of course, I have three different Learjets that are designed for different distance and capacity ranges. It is very low class to spend all of your time on a yacht so you also need beach houses at all of your yacht locations. All of this can become very tiring.Between all of the studio time, the flying, the yachting, and intimate raltions with beautiful women something was missing. I needed a compound worthy of my stature. After a lot of searching I realized that most of northern Detroit was basically in ruins, so I bought it. If you drew a horizontal line north of Auburn Hills I own all of it up to Cananda. After my \"Loisiana Purchase-ish\" type land grab I had a 17th Century style castle built on the highest point to overlook my once automobile manufacturing heavy kingdom.Now, I'm sure you're probably wondering what happened to all of the dark skinned, native inhabitant of this land, aren't you? Well, I am a kind ruler and one of considerable mercy. I have installed what would be considered as a Feudal System in the kingdom. All of my serfs are given a place to live while every second of available daylight is filled with toilings of both farm and field. We will be starting an Organic produce company soon. I figure if the NCAA can make billions off of their employees without paying them while providing nothing more than food, water, shelter, and trade skill training then why can't I? I've also decided to \"one up\" the NCAA by enacting Prima Nocta in my kingdom. I figure that the future of my realm will be much more successful if the bulk of it are my offspring. Multi-Platimun rapper with a kingdom > Inner-city project dwellers. If the Pistons ever need a practice squad I'll drop the law for a few years, but we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.Back to my castle: I live in the top floor with a giant window in the main living chamber that overlooks the moat, drawbridge, Organic farm, and some of the serfs' living quarters. I do hear the serfs will have running water within the next five years. I've never actually seen where they live up close. The drawbridge over the moat is always up and I always travel by helicopter around the realm. Sorry, I'm getting off track again. This gigantic window in the main living chamber always gets dirty and the constant struggle of flying to human traffic auctions in Havana along with the costs of a winning bid on a virgin female under 20 years of age has grown tiring. The male serfs have grown quite fond of this as I always release a new young girl to them weekly. I figured morale would be low amoung them once this ritual stopped, but they can find other activities to engage in. They're paid to work, not to have fun. Well, they aren't paid at all, but they are getting a free education of a valuable trade. How can they complain?Anyways, back to this window; I hired an IMAX crew to install four cameras along the top of the castle wired in series to produce one panoramic shot of the kingdom. There was one problem: I needed a TV worthy of this view. I gathered all of my horses and all of my men and had them search low and high. Finally, success was achieved! I did a cameo on a Mariah Carey album to pay for this amazing television. After two weeks the Postal Service Postmaster of greater-Detroit sent a messenger to alert me of its arrival. When I first powered on all 85 inches of this Ultra-HD 4K miracle I felt like what I feel the three wisemen must have felt looking down at baby Jesus. My baby Jesus wasn't born in a stable, it was born in a castle. I also felt that a gaggle of ill informed Hebrews would not come after this television at any point either. All-in-all, this was shaping up to be amazing!!!The view of my kingdom is much more clear than what it used to be in silly \"real life.\" I want to thank everyone at Samsung for making my life complete. I want to thank all of my fans for buying my music allowing me to buy most of northern Michigan. Apparently I also got something called the \"Upper Peninsula.\" I have no idea what a peninsula is. Maybe it's just a slang term for Canada that I'm not familiar with. I don't know, I've never been there and I don't really care. I feel like another kingdom would be spreading me too thin, so I'll allow the natives of that place to guide themselves until I feel that my army is strong enough to invade and restore order afterwards.", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wow!

Around about 10pm, the bunco activities wind down and its time for a show!  I put on some makeup, a wig, a nice little black dress, clear out some space in the living room in front of the TV and do some lively Broadway show tunes.  I use the TV to help me with the moves and for the background music.  Its all worked out well.  Then, this last Saturday night we used this awesome 85 inch TV.  OMG!  I was belting out the lyrics to some of the wonderful numbers from Grease in front of this bad boy!  Let me tell you, the energy in that room was just unbelievable.  I could put words here to try to describe it, but it just ain't like being there.  I will say, you have not LIVED, until you've danced and sung in front of 12 bunco babes on a Saturday night.

So as an unemployed merchant banker with a love of the \"white stuff\" I had what could only be described as an \"Eureka\" moment. After checking all my credit cards, I found one with just enough credit to book a return trip to Columbia. Previously I had Skyped with Pablo (can't remember his surname but think it ended \"cobar\") over the internet and facilitated \"a few\" imports on his behalf, He said as he trusted me I could have some on credit as long as he got his money more than 28 days after collection of the \"merchandise\".The outward trip was fine although the return home was okay until I hit customs, let me say that a full body search is an experience that everyone should have at least once in their lifetime or twice if they liked it first time round. Regretfully, I am unable to reveal how I got past customs, Pablo said it wouldn't be good for my health. Such a nice guy, didn't even charge for the medical advice.After a couple of weeks doing the rounds at few parties it was job done and the order was placed. Well it arrived with Amazon's usual efficiency and what can I say about this bad boy that hasn't been said before.

I said I was attached to all parts of my body (thought a joke would lighten the atmosphere, boy was I wrong), guess something got lost in translation as  not even a trace of smile showed on their faces, then all hell let loose.Fast forward a few hours and I finally managed to do a deal.... Pablo got most of his money and most of my fingers, thank goodness for previous reviewers mentioning gesture control.  On the plus side I still have my TV and once the double vision and perforated eardrums clear I will again enjoy the viewing experience that is the Samsung UN85S9 85-Inch 4K Ultra HD 120Hz 3D Smart LED UHDTV (Black). On the negative, well there's no negatives after a trip the ER I am so pumped up on painkillers I could go 12 rounds with a grizzly.So why not 5 stars?

Just tell yourself that no one really needs a 401(k) (Hey, that's why there's Social Security, right?) and lots of people live pretty good lives with one kidney and that other half of your liver will grow back, right?But what you don't realize is all of the hidden secondary costs of this thing. Well when I got this thing I thought I was going to be enjoying a marathon session of \"Gillgan's Island\" on DVD all weekend but my weekend turned into a week long process of setting this thing up.First of all getting in the front door. Clearly when the dimensions of your average front door were more-or-less standardized no one had 85-inch TVs in mind. Our ancestors really failed us there. So you're going to need pretty much rip out your entire front door,frame and widen it by a few inches just to get the box into the room; but then angle between the foyer and the doorway to the living room isn't *quite* right so you'll need to start taking down walls, checking to see if they're load-bearing or not. It's just a mess. I suggest doing some research and bringing in a contractor to take some measurements to see if bringing this TV into your living room is possible. It almost reached a point where we had to consider just cutting a big hatch into the roof and then lower this thing in with a helicopter. No matter the route you take, though, you know the government wants to be involved so you need permits and contracts. (Thanks, Obama!)So, now you have your TV in the living room. Well, the stand is nice and all but not really practical in most home situations and besides we all want this bad-boy hanging on the wall.  Well, it might surprise you how much this thing weighs and that household walls are not designed to hold a TV this size.  This TV was Mjolnir, my wall was anyone who isn't Thor.  Now we had to install in titanium-alloy braces and beams inside the wall hard-mounted into the Earth itself like bridge supports.So, now your TV is in the house. It's hanging on the wall and your components are hooked up. What to do now? Well as fun as the GI marathon was the \"upscaling\" can only do so much and I had to sit pretty far away to make the image look like anything other than a big pile of LEGOS.  No, I need to go beyond digital, beyond HD I needed U-HD!  Well, turns out there's not a lot of UHD discs out there. Which is a shame, really. Can we really call ourselves a society if we don't have a cheap and affordable storage medium that holds half a terrabyte?  Luckily I found some pretty good software that was very good at \"upscaling\" all of my DVDs and Blu-Rays into the UHD but this required a small server farm to be installed into my basement. So between this TV and the server farm your electric bill is going to sky rocket! I'm not sure I've ever seen one of those dials on the electrical meter move so fast!So, while I would recommend this TV for great picture quality, clarity and and looking like something you could walk into (and believe me, you will. Mostly because this TV will probably partly obscure the doorway into your kitchen) there's just a lot of secondary costs and problems that you don't think about.  Again, I suggest hiring a consultant first to see if your home is UHD-Ready.", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Highly Recommended. Great Picture Quality!

If you don't own a McMansion, then obviously you don't need or deserve this TV. Again - DUH!).And who's this fool selling his daughter into white slavery? Get real! There are more practical ways to afford this TV. For example, invite your husband for a romantic hotel getaway. Once there, he will be inexplicably abducted, but left in the hotel lobby the following day with a jagged incision and unprofessional-looking sutures. Of course, he will mysteriously be sans one kidney. But the shock of it all will be greatly eased by an equally inexplicable infusion of funds into you bank account, roughly but coincidentally in the amount a kidney fetches in the black market organ trade. And while your husband is recouping from his ordeal, you lovingly buy this TV to occupy him during his long hours coping with post traumatic stress disorder while he watches your favorite daytime talk shows and evening television dramas with you. You experience no separation from a beloved family member, you get the \"wife of the year award\" for giving your man such an amazing gift, you are the envy of whiner have-nots like those who posted above, and you add the finishing touch to your McMansion (which you could have, too, if you were to have an unfortunate and debilitating fall down a flight of stairs while taking a tour of the Department of Justice). Of course, this isn't how I afforded this TV (or my McMansion, for that matter)... I'm just saying.Admittedly, this wouldn't have been such a good option in Mr. Thach's case, because I learned from B. Anderson when he visited from the future that in a few short years, Amanda's twin sister Jennifer will experience kidney failure. And if one of Amanda's kidneys had been removed? Well, she wouldn't be able to give one to her sister, thereby saving Jennifer's life. Still, I'm sure Mr. Thach could have come up with an option other than selling Amanda into white slavery. I mean, didn't I read that he has a wife named Peg? There WAS another option, and I think his \"family decision\" to sell Amanda into slavery was in fact a self-serving and selfish act. I only hope Amanda doesn't experience PTSD like my husband, because the constant twitching almost induces regret (not that I did anything to contribute to his unfortunate ordeal. I only meant that I \"regret\" that he had to go through this).Hang in there, Amanda. And to the rest of you, quit whining! Good things come to people of action.

I had to sell my home and most of my furnishings to get it but the cardboard box it came in is large enough for me to live in so I'm not complaining.  It's just a shame my wife and children have not been able to move in with me so if anyone else who bought this TV would be willing to donate their boxes to me I would be forever grateful.  I would also be very appreciative if someone could send me some additional extension cords.  The cords I have just barely reach the Wal*Mart sign I am tapped into.There are some codes you can use if you can figure out how to get into the Samsung special super-duper-secret stupendous setup section.  I would post here how to get into that area but, if I did, I would be hunted down by the Samsung torture squad and forced to watch nothing but reruns of \"My Mother the Car\" and \"Hello, Larry\" for the rest of my life.If you are able to find that section the following are some of the things you'll be able to do.  Once again I cannot tell you the codes, please remember, torture squad, \"My Mother the Car\" etc.1. Turn almost anything you watch into something you can reach into the screen to get.  Feel like grabbing a beer from your fridge?  Just find a beer commercial on the TV then reach in and grab a cold one.  Think of the money you'll save on food and drink.  Please note that this will not work if the item you are trying to get is bigger than your screen, so forget about that new car, new boat, new house, and so on.  Be careful with this though.  My dog jumped into the screen while I had a movie on that was shot in a forest.  He didn't come back until he had marked every tree.2. Turn anything you watch on it into holographic images.  You can combine the codes for 1 and 2 to make the holographic images real but this could be dangerous.  I did this while watching a boxing match and I wound up being knocked out by an uppercut which I accidentally stepped into when I stood up.3. Change the size of the picture you are watching.  This one is still buggy.  The only change you can do will make whatever you watch appear to be on a 10 inch black and white TV.  I imagine the next firmware update from Samsung will address this issue.4. You know this TV does standard 2D and 3D, right?  Well with the right code you can be watching TV in 1D.  Make this change and everything you watch will look like narrow stick figures.There are more codes but I will keep them to myself until I update this review.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Tickled to death", "Author": "James R.

I can have the view of a Malibu beach house one day, and the wonderful views of the Napa valley the next day. I saw this TV being loaded into delivery truck one day while making breakfast and knew I had to have it. I immediately got online and bought this baby using a wide variety of credit cards. Sure it was more than I knew I could ever make. But I figured if I cut up the credit cards and through them in the river so they wouldn't be able to bill me. The mounting screws it came with didn't quite work in my RV. As it turns out the fiberglass walls that keep me warm at night were extremely weathered and unable to hold up the massive amount of TV. Luckily with enough JB weld I got the TV mounted on the external wall of my Class A motor home. Now, when I set up camp I can watch all 17 channels of quality public access TV my antenna picks up. Some say 4K resolution is overkill, but clearly they have never seen an original Picasso being discovered on antiques roadshow on the PBS in TRUE hd. We might as well just send every other TV to africa as part of some humanitarian effort or something. The size of this TV is truly spectacular. When I'm camping outside the highschool football game, I can hook up my VCR and watch premo 80's porn in all its glory. You havent seen bush until you've seen it in this big. Anyways, the only complaint is that I lost the remote somewhere in San Diego or Tijuana. Also, while trying to clean some of the road dirt off the screen with my power washer I seem to have destroyed the bottom left corner of my screen. But hey, when you have this much TV you really only need the right side of it....am I right? The customer support from Samsung Is subpar at best. I dont blame the TV for coorperates mistake, I just wanted some tech support with trying to hook my RV's sound system up to the TV for some \"surround sound\".

He seems to have doggy ADHD unless I wave a limp partly skinned squirrel in front of his nose.  The cats will have a steady tv diet of mice, hamsters, and guinea pigs. I might toss in a show or two about chihuahuas. I suspect the cats will mistake those for hairless rats. It should be worth a video or two.Once Amazon makes delivery of said televisions and I pay a crew of hunky he-men to install them all over the house, and another to ensure that the house will not collapse from the weight of all of these,  I will donate my old 13\" tv that is in the basement to the senior center.The biggest fault I see with these televisions is that they are not Plasma.

I was very excited to receive my new member of the family, but was a little disappointed when I came home to find out the delivery guy just left it sitting in the garage in the spot that my Porsche used to occupy, rather than bringing it inside and installing it for me....I mean, for that price they should have set everything up, including my favorite channels being programmed into the remote.  And speaking of the remote, I didn't believe when one commenter said it came with free batteries....NOTHING comes with free batteries anymore...but I was proven wrong when I opened up the bag with the remote, and there they were!  2 Beautiful, fully charged aftermarket brand AA batteries.  I can tell that Samsung spared no expense to make sure that my remote would work long after my awesome TV stopped functioning.  Now on to the TV performance itself.  Upon turning it on, I was overcome with excitement as I saw the Samsung logo pop on on the TV, only to realize that the show that was on(I think it was The Brady Bunch) was not in 3D.  I expected to see Marcia coming down the stairs right into my living room, but instead, it was the same boring picture I've seen on all of my other 85 inch TVs.  I thought this was supposed to be a 3D TV?  I fiddled around with the settings, but couldn't find the one to turn on the 3D feature of the TV.  After 3 calls to Samsung(Thank you Jackie for being so patient with me, even though I'm sure your supervisor wouldn't approve of you calling me a \"Dumb moron who is keeping you from helping actual customers with legitimate issues\")  I was left with the disappointment that if something wasn't filmed in 3D, then I couldn't watch it in 3D.  WHAT??  That wasn't in the description of the TV(Which I never actually read, I'm just assuming...I mean, why would they tell you what their TV WON'T do, right??)  After getting over that initial disappointment, I settled in to watch DWTS with my wife, and we instantly got hooked as we could literally see drops of sweat falling from the dancers onto the stage.  I guess some things don't need to be seen in 3D.  Overall, it's a very good TV, but without the capability to watch EVERYTHING in 3D, I'd say the price point is a little high.

After the FedEx team airdropped this TV to me with their CH-53E Super Stallion (I didn't know FedEx still carried these in their fleet) it's been non-stop fun! One of the cool things (unadvertised) is that you can actually claim this TV as a dependent! My 2013 tax return will have good ole Sharkeesha on it with me! If you are hesitant on buying this TV, then stop. Don't think about it, just buy it. With this TV weighing in at a mere 189 lbs; it's so easy to get done watching UFC and get into a good guard position and grapple with this TV. Also, if anyone out there owns a '87 Winnebago, this bad boy fits perfectly in it. I can say from personal experience, that road trips are never the same anymore with this TV!On a side note to parents, this TV makes for an excellent babysitter!

Immediately we fell in love.  She is beautiful and does more than you can imagine.  I have listed the pros and cons of our favorite person in our house:  Shelly.Pros:1 - No Remotes!Shelly comes with a built-in telekinesis AI that reads your mind - even when your not at home!2 - Shelly talks to us, just like any other woman, about nonsense and unlimited useful garbage.  There is a simple setting to turn \"woman-talk\" feature on or off.  But its pretty awesome on.3 - With the arm extension (an additional $12,000 but WELL worth it) never ever go out for illegal massages again. Shelly takes care of all your needs while playing certain movies of your choice to get you more in the mood.  wink wink4 - Shelly comes with the state-of-the-art smell-o-vision which allows you to watch your favorite movies while giving off the smell of your favorite scene!  Imagine being able to smell the beautiful aromas of Hannibal as he cooks Paul Krendler's brain!  WOW!!5 - Shelly has a built-in \"babysitter\" option.  Just turn on this feature and drop your child in front of the TV.  Then Shelly will play all of your child's favorite shows by reading her mind and keep her occupied for hours.  And - with the additional arm extension - Shelly will be able to change your baby's diapers and rock them to sleep.  Perfect for when you want to simply relax with 4 bottles of wine after a long day of watching TV.6 - Speaking of wine, Shelly has a bulit-in wine dispenser and keeps wine chilled at the perfect temperature of your choice.7 - Shelly is fluent in over 6 million forms of communication and even understands Droid talk (and i dont mean Android devices)8 - Bored.  You can browse Shelly's immerse built-in porn library which contains movies from every genre from every year!9 - With the wife feature, you can have Shelly clean your house, do your laundry, cook you dinner and even start an argument for no reason whatsoever! And since Shelly can read your mind you'll never have to worry about her making the wrong meals  SIGGHHHH10 - With the App, never leave home without Shelly. Everything you can do with Shelly at home can be done outside your home.. including hotel rooms.  Wink winkCons:1 - The picture quality is comparable to watching a VHS from 1985.  PURE GARBAGE!  I took off a star because of this.Overall the picture quality is horrendous but for 40k i dont have to do a dam thing anymore in life!

Someone called me and said it was disrupting \"data transmissions\" and asked that I adjust the sharpness, that seemed to solve the problem.2. People driving by from the freeway 3 miles away have taken to exiting the off ramp and parking in the lot across the street to view this. I started selling miscellaneous sundries such as popcorn, sparklers and bottled water and it helped to defray the cost, so that's nice.3. Uninterrupted viewing. While not a \"feature\" it was convenient that I can watch all my favorite VHS tapes from start to finish without interruption because everyone in my family left to stay with relatives until I can \"sort out this mess\". Whatever.Cons:1. Sound quality is so-so. I attempted to hook up a soundbar but the television developed a mind of its own and seems to have eaten it. The factory speakers can certainly shatter glass but the bass was not as deep as I hoped.2. One HDMI input? That just seems like an oversight. I told the guy at Radio Shack and asked if there was a splitter or something but when I showed him the manual he laughed and called his friends over. Even he thought it was funny.3.

Sure the internet is out there and trust me I realize we've all gotten use to a quick wank from those pornhub.com videos that are only 2.5 minutes long but I'm from the old school and I like to take my time and make an experience out of it.So after bringing home my tv I poured a glass of wine (a 1984 Rothschild Beleaux Moi which is a heavenly swallow) and fired up some Asia because I felt \"Heat of the Moment\" would be apropro..  Now a purist would say \"Why not \"Barry White hes got a sexier voice\"?  Well the video I had procured for this maiden voyage into 4000 dpi auto eroticism was \"Cock Asian\" and not \"Sister Act\".Seeing as how this was going to be an experience and not just the old maintenance spit-and-stroke I had also purchased a 5 gallon flagon of \"Ye Olde Wanking Butter\" which is made in the old country by some monks of the Epicondylitis order from 52 different all-natural ingredients and boys do those guys know their business!  My only regret being that though I do love organic products that contain no chemicals or GMO's,  I really wouldnt have minded a little bit of the ole Human Growth Hormone if you know what I mean.  Regrettable, but I got a grip on myself and soldiered on.The picture was incredible!  During one particular scene there was a very large and noticeable pimple had developed on one of the actresses left buttocks.  It drew my attention away from most of the action and while I am a staunch heterosexual and am in no way a \"meat gazer\" I do like to enjoy the pistoning-action of a proper rogering caught on film.  My preoccupation with this grand mal zit was in no small way exacerbated by the incredible quality of the picture.  Eventually my preoccupation became a full blown and almost Poe-like obsession due to the male stars incredible endurance.I crept closer to the screen...Timidly I reached out a finger and touched the screen.What I felt was amazing!  I had the sensation of touching the supple yet firm buttock of a incredibly arousing young woman!  It wasn't the warm smooth glass of a television but rather the warm smooth ass of a tele-asian!  Her body minus the pimple (and possibly a completely compromised and sundered vagina) was unbelieveable!  My mind reeled with the possibilities!  This gruesome twosome onscreen was about to get a \"The Ring\" reversal as I contemplated climbing through the front and making it a freesome threesome!That's when I did it.  I went too far.As the pimple was the only imperfection I felt might mar my experience I decided to once again take matters \"into my own hands\".I reached out and popped it.What happened next is why I have decided to return this television.My face was coated in a copius and cloying amount of zit juice.  I staggered back onto the couch with an \"Aaargh\" worthy of a pirate who has had his booty taken (think about it) and when I cleared my eye I realized with horrow that the worse had happened.It wasn't the zit that had popped and sullied my face...Nay, twas the inevitable \"Money Shot\"!

Webb", "ReviewID": "R26MSO0I4PK7KP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This television ruined my friend's marriage. I must preface this by saying that this is a second-hand review. As a school teacher of 20 years to inner-city, at-risk youth, my income doesn't afford me the luxury of owning such an impressive television. This masterful technology is to be owned by wealthy people who REALLY contribute to society like NBA players and drug dealers.  Nonetheless, the Samsung 85-inch HD Smart LED TV is a home-wrecker.I have a good friend named Arnie. (Yes, even with that name, I'm still willing to consider him a friend.) He is always wasting his money on every single technological gizmo that hits the market, not only because it makes up for him being inadequate, but because his low-self esteem requires him to find any small thing to stay relevant. His vice is high-tech gadgets so he obviously purchased this TV.  However, the screen size and picture are so impressive, it has caused major rifts in both his marriage and his psyche.We've always believed Arnie to be sexually ambiguous, because, at first glance, you'd never suspect him fancying women. After some cyber-stalking (by clicking on FB) we learned that Arnie is indeed married. And to a very pretty woman. That made us feel really good for Arnie. He needs all the ego boosts he can muster. But something went awry. He strayed from his lovely wife and developed an emotional and (sadly) physical relationship with the Samsung TV. When she caught him with it, pants down, HDMI port filled to the brim, she was devastated.  How could any man be that sweaty while latched onto a television yet not be able to deliver in the bedroom with his wife?  The \"SMART\" capability of this TV had been luring Arnie with its flirtatious ways. Apparently, he'd developed feelings for this TV and had taken those feelings to the next level. Physically. And he was in love. He and the TV would become one, after his wife went to sleep. They consummated their relationship while his wife slept, shortly after rewatching the final episode of Nickelodeon's Big Time Rush.  What may have devastated his wife the most is that we all know the 85-inch Samsung Smart TV is male in orientation.  Especially the deep, baritone voice that Arnie had programmed the TV to have. It's like he was cheating on his wife with an only-slightly bigger version of an electronic Barry White, if Barry White was an awesome television set.Worse off, Arnie had broken his vows once before. A few years back, Arnie cut a deal with a down-and-out Ben Affleck. $20,000 for one night. No holds barred. Arnie couldn't pass it up and he paid the money. When his wife found out about this tryst, Arnie swore up and down that he was straight, it would never happen again, and that it wasn't a deal that could be passed up. Considering it was Ben Affleck, his wife finally relented, understanding his choice, but she still wasn't happy. Hindsight 20/20, that money really helped Ben land on his feet so, in many ways, we have Arnie to thank for the movie Argo.In THIS instance with the Samsung TV, though, he paid $40,000 AND it was cross-species/model type fornication. Just too much for his wife to live with.  If it had not been for this male gigolo of an outstanding television set, Arnie and his wife might still be married.  Instead, he sits in his lonely apartment, counting his luxury time pieces, watching his massive television, and whispering sweet nothings as it plays One Direction music videos on repeat. He even got a giant back tattoo of the Samsung TV set. It really has ruined his life.If you are looking for a happy marriage, and don't want to be lured into a fantastical love affair with a piece of machinery, I strongly recommend you steer clear of the Samsung Smart TV.  He is one fickle temptress of a television.  The picture is great, but it's simply not worth the divorce proceedings, psychiatric visits, and screen clean-up you will need to endure after your relationship with it inevitably devolves into a flesh-on-screen romantic affair.

No, my wife didn't like it, but that's OK. Because I didn't like her. Still don't. In fact, you could say I now dislike my wife more than ever. Because throughout our marriage she always took, but never gave. And not once would she work. In truth, she refused to get a job. And, actually, technically, it's \"ex\" wife. Because, in the end, she left me and took the kids. Really, she didn't \"leave\" me, per say, she just decided it was over, and that she was done. Then she had the police issue a restraining order against me and **I** was the one who had to leave. So, in retrospect, buying this $40,000 TV ruined my life.

The white slavery market, being saturated now by Amandas, made selling our own Amanda an exercise in frustration. We had to settle for a figure that was less than half the price that the market was paying for Amandas only 5 days ago.I think Amanda was disappointed at the sale price too, and the fact that the TV is only 120Hz and LED instead of IPS, but was somewhat cheered in knowing that her brother David would be joining her to ensure we could meet the fluctuating AUD:USD exchange rate influenced price of the television.The purchaser did promise to buy his own 4K capable camera and send us the occassional movie which we will be able to view in majestic colour on the big screen. The vivid colours and detail will no doubt highlight every tear that trickles down Amanda's reddish face, her eyes bloated somewhat from constant crying at the low price she was able to attract.But lest this review divert too much from the amazing features of this Samsung television, the experience to be held by gazing upon 85 inches (215.9 centimetres in Australian metric units) is truly inspiring - akin to watching your child being born, though without the messy afterbirth. The remote control, which, unlike a child, comes with two AA batteries, is svelt and secure in one's hands. It never fidgets, each button doing precisely what you tell it to do, each and every time - never complaining, nor getting over tired while all you want to do is for the day to end and put it to bed.The channel switching is remarkably quick, and without children around there's no need for the cumbersome parental locks to be put in place - though they are there for when the children return. I found the glare from the vast expanse of glass that is now our living room wall to be somewhat offputting.

Thank Goodness, because Gretl loves watching Sesame Street on the big screen!  She doesn't mind that she is naked. That's my girl!  She takes after her father.How do you solve a problem like Maria?I say \"How do you solve a problem like Samsung\".  Initially, our TV was shipped to Austria.  This set off a chain of events of which you can only imagine (I secretly wonder if Rolf had a hand in this). Did Hilter have this same TV? -- I don't know. But it does concern me.Also, the free batteries didn't matter much to us.  We knew Mother Abbess would take care of it.  Those sisters know how to do just about anything: disable cars etc. But, they were of absolutely no help in setting up the Samsung TV. I guess they don't care about screen resolution --But, I do have to tell you Jesus looks great on the Samsung! I watched the Last Supper yesterday and it was like I was there in person.  That's some s***!!Other than that, what a mess!  I'd say supercali\"f-ing\"expialidocious. However, I don't like to use curse words around the children.  And also...I think that's a different movie.  Now, I'm confusing myself.The one thing I do know is that when I contacted Amazon and Samsung to complain about the delivery to Austria they provided no options.  I guess there won't be compensation for it which annoys me. But, as a military man I am used to that.  And I am not faint of heart - we will continue to pursue remedies for this intolerable action!As to the system itself -- the sound quality is just \"OK\".  In my opinion, the hills could have been much more alive!Also, during the gazebo scene, Liesl thinks she looks too fat on the Samsung -- this has resulted in body image issues.  I'm not sure if she'll ever get past it.

Now my wife watches Desperate Housewives on Netflix off of it, and I have to avoid eye contact with her.Thanks, Samsung. You made a TV that emasculated me.The TV quality is good, though. It was a little awkward having to hang it, since the trailer doesn't really have a whole lot of wall space, but once we knocked out the wall between the bathroom and bedroom it fit fairly well. Once we cleared away the debris, we were the envy of our neighbors. They kept coming over and asking for various things, even late at night! One of them even tried to get our attention by knocking on the window to our bedroom at around 1AM, I think he heard that there was a marathon of Battlestar Galactica on, but ever since we started just sleeping in the car we really haven't had much trouble sleeping.I'd rate this TV higher, but unfortunately there's so much room for improvement here. For instance, the TV doesn't react well to water. So when we were installing it, there were some problems from backflow where the toilet used to be. Really, Samsung, would it be so hard to just put a protective covering on it? I spent a week drying it out and cleaning it before we were able to watch anything else, and that was just awkward.Another problem was that it makes it really hard to know what's real and what's not in your house after awhile, if you wear the 3D glasses all the time (and why wouldn't you, when you can see it from anywhere so clearly?). I mean, after a few weeks I had a hard time telling when my friend Jason would come over and hang out for hours. Since he'd be there helping my wife around the house before I got home in the afternoon it was sometimes hard to not think he was just part of the house.So beware, buyers.

I knew I had to have this baby, 85\" of lifelike clarity, the kind of stuff you only see through the hubble telescope. My connections with the black market organ division apparently did not have any demand for vital organs mostly because they have seen a recent surge in willing donors, no doubt corresponding with the release of this TV. I was at a roadblock, I didn't know how I was going to get the 40k for this TV, I had to do something fast before the promotional sale ended. I knew I had one week. What took place over the next week is something only OJ Simpson could get away with. I was sitting at my table in the early hours of January 20'th 2014 drinking a freshly brewed cup of Kopi when it hit me, I knew exactly what needed to happen for my dream to come true.Visions of avatar in super 4K HD video were flashing before my eyes, the vibrant intensity of all the blue (which is my favorite color btw) had my heart near cardiac arrest. I recalled being at thanksgiving dinner this past year and my father, a few Heineken deep told me and my wife that he had taken out a life insurance policy just in case any freak accidents ever happened. Now, don't get me wrong, my father and I have a great relationship but I thought to myself, surely an 85\" television of this quality would be enough to help grieve through the loss of a father. I won't get into the grim details of what happened last week but let's just say that OJ Simpson couldn't of pulled off this job as clean as I did. Fast forward to today. I got the money, turns out it was for 50k, some life insurance policy that was. My wife has left me and took the kids, dogs and cat. I got to keep the NES with Super Mario Bros 3 though. I was put out on the street with nothing but 50k in cold hard cash. I converted 40k into prepaid mastercards which is a another story in its self, try explaining why you need 400 prepaid 100 dollar mastercards to the girl working the counter at the pharmacy. Anyway, approximately 74 hours later I had my mastercards ready to go. My only problem at this point was how to get this rocket ship sized TV delivered to the abandon warehouse I was now living in. I decided to open a P.O box. Free shipping was key in this decision as 190 pounds of sey circuitry and glass would cost a fortune to ship. I got it 2 days later(wow that was fast). The remaining cash was used to purchase a 10k gas generator which I wasn't sure if that would even be enough jigawatts to run this monstrosity, luckily I had doc brown on speed dial if needed. I am glad to say that it is up and running now and this old warehouse aside from the rodents has never been so vibrant. I'm a pretty big deal around these parts. My spot is go to for cracked addicts and all drug users alike when they want to escape reality for a few short hours.. All in all, 5 star review and I would recommend this product to anyone willing to go the distance to get it.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "WOW!!!", "Author": "darius tadjrishi", "ReviewID": "R1T5AK6C5AE117", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was going to buy a XBOX1 and a 50inch High (but not the highest) Definition TV. After being upsold to this TV by a monkey in a PCWorld Uniform, I could not afford the XBOX1.This was fine by me as I have a SNES at home. So anyway after many hours making my own HDMI - to - SCART - to RF - converter out of a toilet roll and sellotape I finally managed to get my SNES up and running.WOW is simply the only word i can use to describe the experience.16bit graphics are unbelievably sharp when running at 4k definition. One downside to it however, is that you can't play any horror games - When i was playing Super Mario World, I got to the first castle and Iggy Koopa was so big i soiled myself with my penis. I spent the next 3 days cowering behind the sofa as i couldn't find the remote (luckily enough it was also behind the sofa).I am now playing Kevin Keegan's Player Manager and so far, no more monsters.EDIT - There is a slight health problem with this TV. if you watch it for more than 65 seconds in any 24 hour period, you may bleed out of your eyes, ears and nose. - However if you're like me, then you'll have about 9 pints of blood in your body, so you can realistically get away with 5 minutes of watching, just remember to retain the blood.

But hey no problem!It is so worth watching LOTR on this TV in 17 minute segments daily......I mean with all the walking to work that is all that we can manage, but hey, it feels like we are out there with Frodo, for the Nth time destroying that darn ring in the fires of Mordor.I guess the -1 star from a perfect score is also attributed to an occasional fight with the wife......I mean 17 mins/day, yeah we can get testy at each other over what we would like to watch in that time span. But again, not too big of a problem.Ultimately, we can't wait until the 100+ inch version of this TV comes so we can trade this bad boy in, move to a studio from our current 2 bedroom apartment, and get a loan from the bank to get the next greatest TV on the market. Hope we won't have to wait too long for that. And I wonder if the interest rate on the TV will be low?In the end, it was a great buy.

Yes, it plays PS2 games about as well as they can be played I suppose, though I still think the picture quality could be improved and I have yet to find a place to plug the HDMI cable into my PS2.

As we all know, no matter how GOOD the PICTURE on any of these HD units (4K Ultra or not), the sound is always lagging behind (I liken it to a transistor radio in a Bentley).

I hope amazon begins to carry accessories for this thing-Call quality has been sub-par...actually not working. Your junky iphone wins here-Samsung has really innovated here. The screen is surely larger than any other Apple product they copied.-No expandable memory, cant figure out how to root, no removable battery...a tie with your iphone.-Worried Apple will sue and I have to return it because I dont want to own illegal things and worried Edward Snowde n will tell the world I am using an illegal product.

I can see the acne scars, huge pores and cellulite  of every actor in every movie.  Let's just say this TV has not only changed my life be the residual incomes via my findings, but on a person level, it has increased my self confidence and I no longer struggle with the concern of fine lines, large pores and cosmetic surgery options,  that have cost me well over $40 k,  and I make sure my children's \"dreamy crushes\" appear on our beautiful TV so they can feel better about themselves, and the fact they are actually better looking in real life, to the point it doesn't matter if they are wearing clothes made out of sham wows and duct tape.

You can probably find it for less somewhere else, but I wanted Amazon's free shipping.WHAT I LIKEObviously the display is amazing. No qualms here. The design is outstanding. One look and you know this TV means business (it has a menacing industrial look that reminds me of a very large all-in-one PC or a very, very, very large picture frame). No rounded corners here -- Samsung could've saved $1 billion if it had gone with the design aesthetics of this TV when designing their popular Galaxy mobile phones. For the green people out there, you'll be glad to know that this TV is relatively very energy efficient. In fact, it costs only about $50-60 a year to operate compared to my last TV (Sony Trinitron KV-1310), which used to set me back $90-100 in electricity every year where I live. You see, this TV will actually save you money!WHAT I DIDN'T LIKEMove along, you won't find much in this section because, well, there's not much that I didn't like about it. If I had to nitpick, then I'd have to say that to get the most out of this TV you ought to hire a professional color calibrator, which can get pricey. Also, you need a pretty big living or family room to view the picture at an optimum distance -- if you install this in your townhouse or apartment it would be like sitting in the first five rows at the cinema. One more thing: this thing is freaking heavy, so grab a couple friends to help you set it up; but beware -- once your friends see that you have this TV, they will never leave your house.RATING JUSTIFICATIONI had to deduct one star because this particular model doesn't come in Gold. In this day and age, why not every consumer electronics manufacturer offer all products in multiple colors is beyond me. Hmm...maybe if Samsung were to offer the gold paint job they would get sued again.When I go back to sleep I plan to buy three more of these bad boys, then remove all the frames so that I can plaster them on one side of my wall to make a sort of \"moving wallpaper\".

But now I wonder why I even decided against the idea!I had a few options, I will admit. I thought about saving the money for other things, or using it for helpful causes. But then thought about it- 40,000 for a TV isn't all that bad. So I bought two.And I'm sure my lack of input funds with charities doesn't really matter- someone else will invest. I mean really, where's Bill Gates when you need him- there are dying kids out there Mr. Gates! Who need shoes, food and clean water! Maybe clothes. But whatever.Anyways, the TV is large. So large, it makes the guest room in my yacht seem like a bathroom with only one tub. Getting it through the door was as difficult as getting my espresso perfectly brewed- not as bad but tedious.The other one sits in the living room, and I thought to myself- 'finally, a TV large enough to fit this great big room'. You see, large sitting rooms usually make normal cheaper TV's look like small vintage radios from the 90's.The sound is crisp. Sometimes I catch myself, while tending to my manicured dog, thinking that Morgan Freeman actually snuck into the room or onto my boat with a deep monologue. But my guards are a bit racist, and I thought it impossible. Then I realized, hell, it's the TV! Sure, it's not like sitting in a theater room while Michael Bay adds up to explosives, but it's close enough, and good enough if you don't like sharing a public area with strangers.The picture quality is near perfect. I think JJ Abrams would blush with how his collection of lens flares show up on screen. Sometimes I can actually see the red veins of fatigue in the eyes of Uganda children looking depressed as a commercial begs for help. But a dollar a day? That's $30-$31! That's asking for a bit too much.Anyways, reading previous reviews, I'm glad that I didn't have to sell family members into slavery. It was a thought, but then I managed to swindle money from my husbands credit card. I'm a non working woman with no children you see, so reminding him who's boss is a must. Besides, he works plenty hours signing and looking through some paper work while sitting in a chair for nearly 8 hours! The poor man, I just knew he needed something to soothe his long hours of labor!And what better gift that 2 85 inch ultra HD's?Cool features like voice control really adds to the product. Sometimes I pick up my remote and just speak to the TV when my finger's gotten tired from pressing the volume control, or power button. People got on me about this, and reminded me about America's rising obesity rates. They think all I do is sit on our genuine leather sofa all day- but when the maid's busy picking up my undergarments, I have to get up and make my own coffee. So yes, I do know what it's like to do manual house labor, thank you, so don't worry over my physical activity.Overall, great TV, and for ONLY 40,000, it's a MUST have. Get 2 if you can!

This TV is a little pricey so we will not have a lot of money left over to pay for a high end install. We can afford a 4 pack of Walmart brand Great Value bungee cords after we purchase this TV.

I told my dad and he has a heart attack and died on the spot. His organs alone were worth $50,000 and I got a couple 100 for his various appendages.

Awful decision. Losing that inch made me feel like I was watching a TV from the 70s and the Samsung was only double the price.

Can you guess what I chose?", "Author": "Bryan", "ReviewID": "R76KVRUYLCK1V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm going to be honest here. It was either this TV or a down payment for a house. Considering they are tightening up the mortgage restrictions, I was left with only one choice. As you may have guessed, that choice wasn't a 30-year marriage to a shed (but hey, after a few hundred grand in interest, that shed would've been mine).Was my decision a bad one? All I can say is this: Not only does this TV provide me with one of the most stunning pictures I've ever laid my eyes on, but it's got a couple hidden features (or gems, if you want to call them that). For example, if it ever rains, I can just tip this bad boy towards the ground for adequate coverage. The best part: I can lay under this and still watch TV as the rain slides right off of it! Protection AND entertainment wrapped into one sleek package. Hard to go wrong with that.Of course, the UN85S9 has its downsides. My buddy got his power bill the other day and wasn't too happy about it. You should have seen his face when he found out I had been living on the side of his garage, siphoning his electricity with a cheap extension cord from Home Depot (should've went with the 10 gauge, but after drinking two pints of Guinness at my sister's dance recital, things got a little cloudy). When he saw that I had been using the UN85S9, however, he quickly apologized and joined me for the finale of \"Dancing With the Stars.\" Afterwards, he gently reached over to tickle my elbow to get my attention (I know, he can be \"different\" at times), and that was when he hit me with the greatest thing I heard since I got this TV: I was moving into his garage!Ok - enough of my blabbering mouth. I know what it is that you're wondering. Was the UN85S9 worth it? Well, I finally have a garage that I can call home, and I've also got one of the baddest television sets known to man. Down payment, shmown payment! Forgo the house and get this TV.

No more squinty eyes while trying to lip synch Broadway musical show tunes while reading the lyrics from his phone in the bathroom anymore for him.. nope! He's desperately trying to get one of his friends that own technology companies to actually turn this television into a phone. He really liked how the caller ID popped up when he received a call while watching Glee reruns so he's going to make it happen. I don't know exactly how he plans to carry it around.. I mean, he's a big guy but I don't think it would fit into his pocket. His side career as an actor also was helped since he can now actually sees the YouTube videos he makes.

This being the case, many emotions set in...loneliness, depression, a deep desire to be around REAL people...etc. Sometimes you don't realize how much your TV watching habits have changed you. I finally realized one day that I was too far gone into my absence of humanity, due to my television watching.This lead me to an online search for a life sized female companion/cuddle buddy when I saw this TV. I was SOOOOOOO relieved once I came to the conclusion that I had been searching the web for the wrong product. Upon this realization, I was no longer in the market for the perfect specimen of a life sized female replica. I had my eyes set on the Samsung UN85S9! This TV features voice control to interact with streaming content, hand gestures to control the TV and SOO many more features that make this boob tube truly irresistible!!! To have all of that for ONLY $39,997.99, you have GGOT to be kidding me! What??? Free batteries for the remote? OOOOkay, I'm in! I'm not exactly sure what the remote is for since you physically interact with your TV to control it. In any case, you gotta admit that when the Redenbacher is running low, batteries are always fun for the licking during movie time so sign me up! WHAT A DEAL! Now \"Live with Michael and Kelly\" was going to have an all new meaning...EVERY morning! Words could not describe my level of excitement.Anyways, the only problem was convincing myself to part with the money it took to purchase this dream machine. I had the financial leverage to do so but it took some extra convincing so I did my research. The TV was only $39,779.99 more expensive than the one I was currently using but it came with free batteries and had lower energy costs than previously manufactured TVs, to accommodate those thrifty penny pinchers looking for a great deal. I was convinced! This is a truly magnificent deal and I was $OLD!The next day I called Amazon customer service and arranged a trade for the TV. This company is truly the most customer centric business on earth and it was their great swiftness in precisely appraising the value of my 1983 Mitsubishi Galant over the telephone that really gained my respect. They understood the fact that I was still making payments on my car but they offered me the closest amount to the pay off value that they could and I really appreciated that. I took the $313.74 they gave me for my trade in and RRRAN with it! I now had my life sized television that I financed for a term of 36 months at 19.3% simple interest.I was on such a high from my purchase that you couldn't stop me with a silver bullet! I was on a roll! I then called me Auto Insurance company to adjust my policy. Let me find out that they don't offer Auto Insurance for your television!!! I was IRATE! O well, I thought to myself. I guess I'll just have to be very careful while driving it and not let my road rage get the best of me. I was fine. I thought it was ridiculous that they treated me so rudely and acted like nobody has ever inquired about this type of scenario before. Once again, O WELL! I was to turn in for the night so I could wake up nice and refreshed before having breakfast with life sized Michael and Kelly on the TV.I woke up the next morning in such great spirits! I showered, cooked breakfast for three and waited for the clock to strike 7:00am when Michael and Kelly were to arrive at my apartment. I accidentally spilled Kelly's coffee on the mother board of the TV while pouring it in her mouth but I was sure a TV this expensive was coffee proof. I didn't let it bog me down any. Plus the sparks created such a show that, in my mind, only symbolized the level of triumph I was being overwhelmed with the first morning of my existence with this TV.As I was getting ready for work, I will admit that it was mildly difficult and time consuming to carry the television down 113 flights of stairs from my high rise New York apartment. Once, I reach the street with it, I also didn't appreciate the horrible looks I received when I expressed my dissatisfaction as my one day old TV wouldn't start. Things were getting off to no start for the day. I was late already so once the thing finally fired up, I had to give it all it had if I was to make it to work on time. I was so relieved to finally be on my way to work that what happened next SHATTERED my entire day. I had hit a speed bump and bottomed out. This did some damage.The events from the rest of the day are irrelevant. The following morning I turned on Michael and Kelly to find that the TV was damaged in such a way that it looked as though Kelly had a growth on her face. Let me tell you, I was DISTRAUGHT with a capital D! As I tried to fix it, the thing exploded. I was at a loss for words. I had no idea what I was going to do with my life from that point. My TV was obvi totaled! How was I to get to work without a TV???All I could think about was \"how STUPPID AM I for driving my TV so fast over a speedbump!\" With no Auto Insurance on my TV, I was to pay the remainder of the note one $1,307.87 payment at a time.My advice to people doing research before purchasing this TV is just don't. Yes, it's a really awesome TV. Yes, it at first seems as though it could solve all of your problems. It's glitz and glamor are highly attractive and can draw you in. In the end though, you will only find that this TV is burdensome and will ruin your life in the worst ways unimaginable.Take it from me: #don't", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "jealousy", "Author": "stark2f8", "ReviewID": "R1ETH9K1GD7BEM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Ever since invading a 3rd world oil producing nation I realized I could finally live in luxury and decided to support this great company.

Well for me, being a humble guy that I am, my ultimate dream purchase was this beastly Samsung TV.The times were tough, people could not find jobs.  I could not find jobs.  But I had to do whatever necessary to buy this TV for my favorite TV shows, or play my Playstation with awe.  As a result, I decided to join the military.  Yeah many join up to serve their country, pave a way for their career and whatnot.  But for me, there was one thing and one thing only - this beautiful piece of man made masterpiece.  I signed up for additional years to get the sign-on bonus, which would expedite my getting my hands on this TV.  For years while I was in service, I only ate at mess hall, with occasional dining at McDonald's for a Big Mac.  While others were going out on the weekends, I stayed home doing research and analysis on object of my affection.After having retired in the military with full pension, I'm happy to say I have finally purchased this TV.  Many have asked me why I stay single.  Well, if I have a wife and kids, where would my money go?  Exactly.  Whenever I pass by a homeless person, I think of chipping in a few bucks.  But then, I thought my ultimate dream machine, so I inclined not to waste my money on this homeless dude.Life is short.  Therefore, sometimes you have to be frugal and be less giving in order to make your dream come true.

Fortunately the computer farm has enough spare water cooling capacity to keep the TVs cooled down as well.I am paying for the TVs by leasing simulator time out to various professional racing teams. Now, with these new TVs, I am getting calls from various F1 teams that I cannot disclose (one is sponsored by a caffeine infused drink company named for a four-legged male animal, another uses a different four-legged animal on their logo). It is convenient for these teams because the simulator is located right next to my full-scale moving ground wind tunnel. Talk about a marketing opportunity! After installing these TVs I did have to hire security to keep the aerodynamic engineers from trying to get some unauthorized free time on my sim since they cannot afford it on an Engineer's salary. Peasants.Since he just retired from F1, I can talk about Mark Weber, who comes by regularly to help out with the development in exchange for some sim time. He seem to really enjoy these new, larger screens, but I can only guess because he does not seem to speak English. Ross Braun also comes by often, since he frequently uses the wind tunnel, and can expense the sim time since he is a Team Principal. Ross helps me communicate with Mark, since apparently Mark comes from a country that splintered off from England somehow. Whatever.Anyway, if you are serious about iRacing, you will buy three of these. Otherwise you will not be able to compete with me and my sim. I don't care if you are a pro NASCAR racer.

Mainly because 85\" is a lot more than she is used to handling. I assured her that, once she took in the whole experience, she would never be the same. I was right.Now, I'll admit, once it showed up at our front door, it seemed virtually impossible to fit the whole thing in. As a matter of fact, the first time, my wife whined that it was WAY too big, and there was no possible to fit the whole thing in there. Fortunately, with a little elbow grease and some lubrication along the walls, we stuffed it right in. I can assure you, there is no possible way for us to get anything in that area at all, now that it's in there, but it fit, thankfully. (I'm not sure if we'll ever be able to get it out, either.)The first time I hit the power button, my wife complained that it gave off too much heat, and the vibration from the speaker made it a little awkward to her liking. She soon got used to that, though. I thought there was something wrong with it, because my wife seemed to look uncomfortable every time I turned it on, but she's doing fine now.I must say, if there's anything to complain about, it's simply this: the sound is a bit muffled, and it fades in and out, depending on where she stands in the room. For instance, if she is in the kitchen, it sounds muffled and faded, but when she's close to me, it's just muffled. I also noticed that it smells kinda strange after it being in there for a few weeks. Otherwise, it's a great addition to our lives. She's not nearly as bitter about the MUCH smaller one she had been used to for the last 10 years.My suggestion is this: When you tell your wife that you are going to give her 85\" for Christmas, she's going to complain, but just stick to the plan.

Then I stumbled upon this TV, and I suddenly sensed there was something missing in my life. My wife, Didi, tried to tell me it was because I had left my seven-year-old son at a Best Buy in downtown Detroit, but she doesn't understand that you have to camp out overnight when the Xbox One launches. Any way, he got me one, so it's clearly not that. Good job, Timmy, wherever you went after snagging that coveted console! Any how, I'm playing Battlefield 4, and I'm getting my ass kicked by a bunch of Indonesian third graders, and I realize that it's probably because of the inadequate screen size of my TV, and the fuzziness of 1080p resolution. Luckily my wife has a really high limit on the the credit card that I signed her up for. Yearly income? One million dollars! Even more fortuitous, I've been unemployed for the last three years, so I'm home to intercept the bill while she's at her second job.  Now armed with this plastic wish fulfiller, I discovered that Amazon is discounting this beast five grand, which is probably why there were only three left in stock. Without hesitation, I clicked on \"add to cart\", but then began worrying about how I would pay the bill. And then I had an epiphany - the credit card was in my wife's name. With that moral dilemma lifted, I laid back on my couch, took another bong hit, and hallucinated in 4K. About a week later I'm walking my dog, Max, and as he's defecating on my neighbors flower bed, I see a semi drive up to my house with half of a modular home. Then I realized that what I thought was a bifurcated house with beige siding and the word \"Samsung\" written all over it was actually my new flatscreen TV. I looked down at my dog, Tex, to see how he was making out and thought \"Wow is that thing massive\". The TV was really big, too.  It took the engineering firm I hired about a week to unpack and set up, and it wasn't cheap. Did you know they take credit cards? I do now! So anyway, just as I'm preparing to school some wise ass Malaysian pipsqueaks, someone started annoyingly ringing my doorbell. After about the seventh or fifteenth ring, I almost got off the couch to see who was there, when, luckily, my wife, Mimi, awoke after working a double shift and crying herself to sleep worrying about our missing son, Jimmy, and rushed to the door. Unfortunately for her it was the police who were there to arrest her for what they called unprecedented credit card fraud. Doubly unfortunate for her they spotted the meth lab I had set up in my daughter Kimmy's room, and because the mortgage for the house was in her name, she took the rap. Unfortunately for me, I was forced to leave my house and new TV by the Hazmat team the police called in to clean up my wife Bibi's meth lab.  Damn, my life sucked. Where would I play Xbox now! And then it came to me - my only brother Ro and his wife Jen rented an apartment a few miles away, so I got my dog, Ajax, and sped off in my wife's 1986 Toyota Tercel, frantically thinking of some way to talk my brother Joe into buying a massive TV for me to play video games on. By the time I arrived at their apartment, I had come up with not only an undeniably rational reason to buy an 85\" TV, but also, considerately, a way for them to pay for it. Moe's wife, Bren, had recently given birth to their first child, Troy. On the black market, he had to be worth fifty grand, easy. That would leave an extra ten grand to buy a lot of new games for the new Xbox One console. For some odd reason they seemed perturbed and asked me to leave. As I left Bro and Jan's apartment I realized why they seemed so angry - they were Playstation fanboys! Geez, did I screw up! On top of that I had left my car keys in their apartment. Having no desire to face their wrath, I decided to hot wire my wife's 2012 BMW 6 series, which, talk about weird coincidences, is the same model car my brother Nero's wife, Nan, drives.  And so, there I was, homeless, wifeless, childless, and most of all, 85\"-4K-LED-TV-120Hz-less! There was, however, a silver lining - I still had the box the TV came in, and so, today, thank you Samsung, my dog, Anthrax and I are not homeless! I just wish this box came with more outlets and a bigger kitchen, although a guy I know told me it's not that costly to add some more. What's weird is that I forget his name.

The problem was finding a wall big enough to mount the tv was difficult. My neighbor is a contractor so he helped me extend a wall to accommodate. After finally mounting it, it pulled the wall down because of what my neighbor the contractor said I had \"a 200 pound tv on my wall, equal to a full grown man permanently attached\".Since neither option worked out we found a solution that made sense. We mounted it on the ceiling. Apollo 13 was amazing! Unfortunately, it is the only thing we have been able to watch since my wife and I are juggling 3 jobs to pay for the tv.

To start, good speaker wire is a must. At the amazing price of $48,000.00, two strands of these ( Wireworld Platinum Eclipse Biwired Speaker ) 6 meters each was short of my needs so I ordered three sets. The drivers I decided on were these beauties ( Waterfall Audio Niagara Standing Loudspeakers )  that $39,393.71 a pair which, of coarse, I ordered two. To crunch enough power into these bad boys, I used this beast! ( Klipsch THX Ultra2 TX NR3010 Elite 20 ) At only $12974.00, I couldn't pass it up.The next challenge that I faced was another wiring issue. Since most of the units at our trailer park are wired with only 100 amp service panels, I worked with Earl, Junior and Darlene to jump all of our systems together in a quasi parallel/series set-up that keeps the extension cords to a minimal running through the puddles on the 'round-a-bout'.Another challenge overcome was getting this monster in the park. The semi and forklift that delivered it couldn't get further than the dumpsters, so, moved Ray's trailer while he was at work and backed in in from that snazzy neighborhood next door that has them home-owners bi-laws. We got the privacy fence back up before the cops got there and the only proof of our so-called 'trespassing' was the giant muddy ruts left through them folks yard. Since all of us are... well... retired, and home that day as 'witnesses', the police are still looking for that maniac in the dump truck that made the turn around in those peoples yard. The only damage done, well, besides the ruts, was the three sago palms that got 'bumped'.... oh.. and that fancy sprinkler system got a couple of lines broke... oh, and now their sewer backs up because the drain fields got crushed a little.Now, I bet you're wondering why I ordered an extra pair of them speaker cables when I only ordered four speakers...huh? Well, I had to use them other two cable to keep my girlfriend Cherry from gettin' loose. She was a little concerned after her old man showed up wondering about the address that showed up on his credit card when this stuff was delivered. Well, to say the least, nobody's gotta worry about him snoopin' around anymore! Hehee!! Remember that movie Deliverance? Oh yeah! Squeal like a pig boy! Squeal like a pig!!Anyhow, after all the trouble gettin' that thing in the yard, we found out that it would fit in the door. Simple solution! We sawsalled the aluminum off the end of the old domicile and just mounted that thing to the end of the trailer! No worry about being exposed to rain and such. We just split the box open that it was delivered in and used it to extended the roof out over this beautiful creature. Earl had the best idea... He said we oughta mount it on swivels. That way, we can just spin it around and show movies outside and charge admission. The only problem we had was figuring a easy way to move all the sound equipment outside, but, that kinda took care of itself. The first time we powered them babies up, all the windows blew in the mobile home, so, problem solved! That also took care of a few of the pesky pit bulls that had been running loose in the neighborhood. The biggest problem I had was calming Cherry down over the stains when all of her cats went boo boo at the same time and then my Rottweiler, Crusty, got a little confused with all the racket. She's still a little miffed about them cats, but, at least it got her mind off of her old life with that pasty feller that she had been living off of. His new boyfriend didn't want her hanging around anymore....So, all in all... once the mods were in place, the neighbors and I are all pretty impressed with this little set-up. There's been a little wrangling with the uppity crowd from the neighborhood next door, but, once we drive the property values down enough, we got a man that's good with something called CRA's... community reinvestment act loans or something like that. We should be able to get enough to purge the area of them undesirables and them we can get the state to come in and bull doze them houses and make room for a whole slew of 'modular homes'.

Once I pulled that off, I promptly sold the excess drywall material to the local construction company and made enough money to buy 48 of these Samsung 4K Ultra HDs.

People outside can see the back of all of those TVs, which worries me. So now I have 48 more Ultra HD tvs on order so I can install them facing out to the streets.

When I first saw this masterpiece my gaze was locked on the sheer beauty of what was presented before me. The technological advancement we as a species have achieved by creating an 85 inch 4K ultra HD 120hz 3D Smart LED TV is only second to the ability to display an image of crystal clarity and perfect composition. Look at the magnificent symmetry and complementary nature of a snow covered landscape and cloud draped sky. The lonely tree standing solemnly off to the side clearly representing the human condition left stranded to endure the cold harsh reality of life. A tree desperately trying to achieve success by growing to the sky only to realize the cruel and devastating reality of being firmly tethered to the ground, a powerful metaphor for our trivial human journey. The isolation from all other life only adds to the struggle of this tree's poor existence and reminds us all that our efforts to provide shade to the ones we love is an exercise in heartbreak as the winter of old age will drive away any love or affection as our leaves of purpose wither and die.The $39,997.99 price tag for this piece of art was an absolute bargain, especially when you consider the added benefit of a 4k ultra HD 3D smart LED TV that can be turned off when the emotional toll of staring at such a bitterly truthful scene of melancholy certainty is too much to bare. When I received this gift from GOD only five to eight business days after placing my order, I removed it carefully from its cardboard protective sheath and hung it on my wall, all the time handling it with the care of Mary cuddling the Baby Jesus. You can only imagine my disappointment when I plugged it into the electrical outlet bringing to life a bright blue screen where the words \"No Signal\" taunted me with the clarity only a 4K Ultra HD 120hz 3D Smart LED TV can provide. The image that so beautifully represented my dismal existence was not to be found.Nothing could hurt me more than this disheartening moment, that was until I called the Samsung customer service department to ask for technical assistance in rendering the digital illustration of my newly acquired masterpiece. They laughed at me.

So I figured as much as I love to go to the movies, it would really save me some big bucks to have this TV at home and bring the movie screen to the comfort of my family room!

Well, I pride myself on my good credit and make all my credit card payments on time but little did I know that not being able to pay the electricity bill, internet and mortgage was going to get me into a bit of a pickle.

Being the complete irrational early adopter that I am, I decided this tv was worth more than my wife. After all, this thing must be a chick-magnet which would ensure a quick replacement. First, I attempted to poison my wife's drink with roofie. Somehow our drinks got mixed up and I woke up 2 days later with a banana in my rectum and my dog humping my face. Next, I tried to suffocate her with a pillow while she was asleep. She woke up, sprang out of bed, threw a kick and broke my nose. I told her that her breath was causing me great displeasure.  My next attempt was to run her over with my car while she was jogging. I crept behind her as she was jogging, but it happened to be someone else with similar workout gear. My car is totaled and I am facing manslaughter charges. After that, I attempted to come from behind and slit her throat. She mule kicked me in the groin and elbowed be in the mouth, knocking my 2 front teeth out.  Ironically, she took me out to dinner and died of embarrassment with my zigzag mosquito nose and hillbilly grill. I got the life insurance settlement and ordered this right away. This Samsung tv was so worth every penny, my car, my freedom, spousal death and physical deformation that I had to go through to get it.

I figured since we sold our house, our cars, most of our junk and other items in storage to purchase Obamacare. We felt this luxury was worth it. We adored it, yes, past tense, adored it. Since we sold our home, we moved into a cave. Since Caves do not have windows, we hooked up the TV to our older, yet compatible, digital movie camera, and game console projector thingy - also hooked up to our outside security camera so we could see the outside world. Picture - in - picture - in - picture - in - picture is a wonderful thing. Well, waking up in a cave can be rather dark. Thank God for the reality vision. The brightness of the screen lit the entire cave. The security camera was showing me the outside view.  It was beautiful outside. I was still a bit groggy from waking and wanted to step outside. Yup, you guessed it, walked right into that full screen 4K reality vision screen. Like I said i was still groggy from waking up. I remembered the sliding glass doors I used at the old home. I could walk directly outside from the bedroom. My scream of pain, the crash, the sudden \"lights out\" affect, the sparking wires caused as I walked through the screen - scared the dogs, and sent me to the hospital. Well to add insult to injury, I went to the hospital, told them I had Obamacare. They checked the website, it was down. They called the state where I live. The Navigator was sleeping at the key board. When woken up he said, \u201c Sorry, he does not show as registered and therefore does not have insurance.\u201d Now I owe for the emergency room visit. Then the bank called the other day. They are reposing our cave. So to make a long a story short - the picture is beautiful, the cost is high, the ease of use is, well, easy.

For three whole months, I sold my food stamps and struggled to keep myself from spending my government assistance checks on cigarettes and fast food.  I really missed my steak dinners the last few months but it was worth the sacrifice to buy this TV.  The kids get free breakfast and lunch at school so they really only got hungry at dinner and on the weekends.All 6 of the dads are deadbeats and it angered me to spend the child support payments on feeding my children instead of getting my hair and nails done.  I fought through the pain and finally saved enough money to order this TV.  Since my Hummer was in the shop getting 25 inch rims, I couldn't pick the TV up at the store and I decided to order it online.I live in a state where Amazon does not collect sales tax so ordering it online saved me a few thousand dollars as well.  I avoid paying sales tax at all cost and don't have a job to avoid income tax.  I tell my friends that my children are my paycheck and I am excited to announce that I am 6 months pregnant with number 7.  Hopefully I can figure out who the dad is before I give birth so I can put him on the birth certificate and hold him hostage for child support for the next 18 years.  Either way, having another child should put my monthly government assistance checks at around $20,000 so I figure I can scrape by.So anyway..... back to the TV.  I regret to announce that the box arrived today but it was too big to fit in my trailer.  I'm not sure what I am going to do yet but I will make sure to post an update when I decide.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Tv for a Steal", "Author": "Christopher", "ReviewID": "R2A8HSQICLXNVX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all the price blew my mind, it was soooo cheap.

In our drunken stupor, we had decided to spend all the money we had pooled, which turned out to be exactly the price of this television set.His home is a maze of strangely shaped walls, broken doors, and piles of dirty clothing. The delivery driver had an assistant help move the television set, but they were unfortunately trapped in the stairwell, and the television had fallen and broke the assistant's back. Luckily the television was undamaged, as that was our main concern (we do pay for obamacare, so it shouldn't be an issue anyway for the assistant).Unfortunately a thunderfly did get in between the cracks. If you haven't had in insect in your monitor or television before count yourself lucky. Due to this blemish, he had kicked it several times, but it was undamaged, however repel rodent droppings did drop from the top, we are unsure if they were from the purchase or if rodents decided to use it as a lavatory. However, due to the recent poor weather, a pipe had burst and we found out that the television was not 'smart' enough to repel water. You'd think a television, which is frequently around liquids such as soda, bodily fluids, wet paint, and melted ice cream would be water repellent, but again samsung dropped the ball. They asked us to send it in to repair it, and I was giving out the information, but my S4 glitched and it dropped the call.

Good to know we all can have a sense of humor! On the serious side, I have never seen such a awesome picture off a flat panel display, especially when you actually have REAL 3840 x 2160p (UHD) material to feed it. This thing has so much detail you need to sit closer to it to see it than your would for a normal HD panel. Up conversion from 1920 x 1080 looks pretty good too, but doesn't hold a candle to real 2160p. The display does pivot some, and can moved vertically on the supporting frame. The speakers are in the frame, and considering the restraints of doing that sound amazingly good. Since the UHD standard isn't yet written (look for it late 2014 or the following year) Samsung supplies HDMI 1.4 inputs in a small plug-in box they call \"One Connect.\" This gives them room to add Display Port, HDMI 2.0, or whatever the UHD standard will call for without replacing the set. The only negative comment I can make is for UHD, the display isn't big enough. You need a display at least 10' wide to appreciate the resolution of UHD at a \"normal\" viewing distance. Human vision just isn't that good. Samsung should consider building a projector in this price range.
