{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Few-Frills TV", "Author": "J. Finkel \"Jack of Trades\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZOX6JV9ARV0Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The LG 42LV4400 LED HDTV performs well overall, but lacks some important features you may see in competing televisions.==Menu==The menu is the same one LG has been using for a few years now. Pushing the \"home\" button brings up selections for changing picture/audio/parental/time/channel settings etc. These sub-menus are easy to navigate thanks to pictures and large text. While the organization of the menus are great, the breadth of the options available is disappointing.==Picture==The picture on most LCD's is rather good these days. The 42LV4400 ranks right up there with any mid-range HDTV. The blacks could be much better, but with some good tweaking in the regular menu settings, you can achieve fairly decent color accuracy and 'pop' (the sensation of depth and realism). As with most LCD's, the brightness is more than abundant, making it a good TV for any room. It also has a matte finish, which makes it difficult to see reflections.==Aesthetics==The bezel of the TV is 1\" on top and sides but almost 3\" on the bottom. The bezel and stand are a high-gloss black with very simple contours and slightly rounded edges. Overall, it looks plain but also attractively understated. It would be a good choice for a professional environment as well as a home.==Build==The LG 42LV4400 is fairly light, making it easy to setup by oneself. The stand seems sturdy enough, but a little more weight would have been comforting. The stand doesn't offer any tilt and doesn't swivel too well. The inputs are...streamlined: there is one component input and no composite inputs besides; no dvi. The three HDMI inputs are ample though and the USB port is a good addition. The buttons on the TV are not in the most convenient place, being recessed on the side by 2.5\". The buttons feel cheap, but are responsive. Most people will use the remote anyway, which is more of the same. The remote feels cheap as well, but looks okay and works fine. Since there aren't a ton of features on this TV, the remote is simple enough. There is no ethernet nor wi-fi.==Motion Handling==One option I always look for right away is smoothing out motion (sometimes separated into blur and judder). Most LCD's have issues producing clear, smooth, flowing video of motion. This is a major disadvantage vs. plasma, which does not suffer the same problem. The refresh rates (120Hz or 240Hz instead of 60Hz) are used to adjust the way your eyes see the motion on the television. In the best TV sets, the video is processed so that there is no stuttering and also no \"Soap Opera Effect,\" a problem introduced when there is too much processing that can make any video look unnaturally smooth as the processing tries to correct the normal variations in speed that us living things tend to do so much when we move about. Unfortunately, with the 42LV4400, you have almost no control over the motion handling, aside from selecting a picture mode (Cinema, Game, Sport, etc). In Game mode, the motion handling is turned off to reduce input lag. In Sport mode, it is turned all the way up, so you can see a football gliding from the quarterback to receiver without too much choppiness.==Calibration==If you plan to calibrate this TV yourself, you'll be sorely disappointed. My older 42LH90 has settings for 10-point IRE gray scale and color/tint settings for primary and secondary colors. Such features as those may only interest videophiles with a spectrometer at their disposal, but the 42LV4400 completely lacks the ability to adjust the gray scale. Most other TV's I've come across in the last few years at least have a 2-point IRE gray scale adjustment. I assume more calibration settings are available in the service menu, but I haven't found how to access that, despite reading through the manual on the included CD.==Other Features==The picture menu lacks some important settings, but does let you create a fairly convincing picture overall. See the end of the review for my settings (though every panel is different). Parental controls are well laid out. The Game mode seems to work well enough to play FPS, though a game like Rock Band may still need some adjustment in-game. Sound is okay, but I'd recommend using external speakers with any TV. Unfortunately, the USB access will only let you view pictures. You can't view movies or listen to music from the USB port like you can on some other LG models. Also, I did run into a peculiar issue where this TV failed to input any signal from my DVDO video filter. Both functioned normally when paired with other devices.==Conclusion==The 42LV4400 lacks the features necessary to be considered a high-end TV, but it is capable of producing an excellent picture that will rival any mid-range TV. I'd recommend this model to anyone trying to get the best picture for the least amount of money. It would best fit a consumer who typically doesn't bother adjusting the settings on their TV and isn't bothered by the way some LCD's poorly handle motion. It would also be a great fit for professional settings, like a conference room or waiting area.UPDATE: I just measured the input lag of this TV compared to my HP ZR24w (S-IPS LCD, not CRT) computer monitor and using game mode. The LV4400 averaged roughly 10-15ms behind. In the other modes it crept up to around 30-40ms. These results are very good and likely reflect the moderate use of video processing.UPDATE (11/28): I recently added a close-up of the pixels in what looks like a \">>>\" shape. This indicates that my LG 42LV4400 is an IPS panel. The viewing angles are very good as would be typical of an IPS. The prime viewing angle seems to be +/- 30\u00b0 from center (side to side) with only minor loss of contrast up to +/- 45\u00b0 and subtle degradation at wider angles.--My Settings (3 sets)--Aspect 16:9 -- Set by Program -- Set by ProgramEnergy Saving: Auto -- Medium -- MinimumPicture Mode: Cinema -- Standard -- GameBacklight: 30 (can't change if energy saving is Auto) -- 70 -- 70Contrast: 80 -- 88 -- 85Brightness: 60 -- 52 -- 50Sharpness: 56 -- 50 -- 55 (set lower if viewing only HD)Color: 55 -- 65 -- 55Tint: 0 -- 0Color Temp: Medium -- Medium -- MediumFresh Contrast: High -- High -- OffFresh Color: Low -- Low -- OffNoise Reduction: Medium -- Medium -- OffGamma: High -- Medium -- LowBlack Level: Auto(cant change in any setting -- Auto - -AutoEye Care: Off -- Off - OffReal Cinema: On -- On -- OffUPDATE for calibration enthusiasts:Notes on calibration from color spectrometer readings with HFCR and EyeOne Display2: The Game mode produced the flattest gamma but all were roughly 2.1 on average with the other modes spiking up high towards the 90% and 100% on grayscale. The grayscale was very good with Cinema mode producing mostly 5-6 and in Standard mode 6-8. Game mode the grayscale error suffered, pushing up to 10 on many readings. The Cinema mode had a wildly off Blue result of 50, but otherwise the primary and secondary colors were on the 10-20 delta E range. I was able to push the contrast to Y=200 at 100% and Y=0.1 at 0% without much trouble. My calibrated settings were around Y=100 at 100% and Y=0.2-0.4 at 0%. I was unable to access the service menu; Pronto access codes for Harmony remote did not work, though they did function on my LG 42LH90.", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "GOOD while it worked, bad TV", "Author": "Ivan Alcantara", "ReviewID": "R1F4JN8O8SUT10", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this TV on december 20th, and I was all excited about how good is the picture quality and how cheap it was and how I thought I hit the jackpot with it...I kept on reading msgs from other users who bought it as well and were complaining on the TV dying after a couple of weeks, but that was not my case...UNTIL may 13th, I was playing on my ps3 and the picture went off but I was still getting sound, thought might be the ps3, tried other inputs, different outlets but it was just not working. Contacted LG and they told me they need to check it cuz thats an internal problem that has to be reviewed by a technician, which they were offering for free BUT, and this is where my bad luck comes, I live in the Dominican Republic, so the warranty is not covered here. I took it to a place and they said the main board is malfunctioning, but they can't even find a place to buy it from, I've checked online for it and nothing.I'm really disappointed, in the end I didnt save any money, cuz now I have to pay for a technician to repair it, to buy the parts. It's just frustrating, and I would not recommend anybody to buy this TV, cuz it will stop working soon.", "Date": "June 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Must have gotten lucky?", "Author": "nate24", "ReviewID": "R3IIYOBXWOHEQT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everyone seems to have had bad luck with this TV but I bought mine in May 2011 and am still getting god picture and have had no problems.

The first one I got had to be sent back within that week... the tv would be on, but the picture wasn't there, something with the video card.  A repair guy came and gave me sage advice that the part would take a few weeks, why not return it to Amazon and get a new one.  So I did.  It came quickly and happy day the TV worked great.  Really good picture, had no problems with it, loved it even.  Until today, it won't turn on.  I have had to once again call up LG and have a repair guy come over.  It is the beginning of June.  So with the first seven months I have had two issues with this TV.  I don't have high hopes for it once the warranty is gone....", "Date": "June 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good value, good picture", "Author": "Ron Rico", "ReviewID": "RJCRQMKNB7LBA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Read the reviews and was leery that I, too, might end up with a lemon. But I didn't want to invest excessively on a tv, and I wanted an LED to conserve energy (I live off-grid on solar power). Knew the sound would be lacking. However, I am quite satisfied with this tv. The picture is very good at normal viewing distance (beyond 3 ft- I sit about 10 ft back). HD picture is beautiful.  Set up was easy. Very light- mounted it on the wall by myself. Slim profile. The speakers are weak (internal speakers are inadequate with all very thin LED flatscreens). But I hooked up some cheap computer speakers and it is quite fine. Watched playoff football and quite happy with the picture of fast motion. Good price for a good product. I've had it 4 months- others have said it wouldn't turn on suddenly after owning it for a month.  Because I got the tv reasonably inexpensive from my local appliance store (they met the Best Buy and Amazon price), I bought a 2 yr extended warranty to cover my leeriness over quality, so they will take care of any problems locally and I don't have to deal with shipping it back. Not a single problem yet.  The 42LG LV4400 is a great product.

Like many other reviewers, my tv will no longer turn on.  I called LG, and they would not honor the warranty (which, admittedly, had expired) until I told them I knew it was a known issue.  They scheduled a local repair company to come out within 48 hours.  I called the repair company, Best Servicers of America, and they said that they did not have the part in stock, it would take 3-5 business days to be shipped, AND I had to send thema a receipt.  Luckily, I bought this online so I could forward them that email.  After a second canceled appointment, they finally came out WITH THE WRONG PART.  Two parts have to be replaced to fix the issue (which, again is well known with this model) and one of those was the incorrect part.  The Repairman blamed it on LG, and when I called LG to see what happened, they blamed the repairman.  Really professional on both sides!  There is no way to call in and see that the correct part is ordered, and now that I'm on MY FOURTH APPOINTMENT I am anxious to not have to wait 3-5 business days, get home for the repairman only to find out it's the WRONG PART AGAIN.
