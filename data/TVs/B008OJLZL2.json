{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great picture, the worst sound since 1962", "Author": "Vinny V \"Vinny V\"", "ReviewID": "R2PMC3U1OG9WFU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm really sad to be returning this TV because the pictures is excellent, but somehow, Haier missed the boat big time on the audio of this TV. I am not exaggerating to say that I have a 25 year old GE clock radio that has better sound than this TV. I really love the picture, but it is so bad I have to return it. There is no RCA outs for the audio, so I had to try the available 3.5mm PC Jack. It works, but you get a loud pop when the TV goes on or off. Thus when you use this in a bedroom and put it into sleep timer, there is a loud POP when the TV shuts off, thus waking you back up. It is virtually impossible to enjoy the TV with the built in speakers. You can get a sound bar (then you are over $300) which means you could have just bought a far better TV and you still get the great POP when powered up or down.It is really a shame because as stated, the picture quality is great. I purchased an Insignia from Best buy and brought it back because of the picture quality, then got this after some reviews. I just can't get past the supremely poor audio quality and engineering. I gave it 5 stars for the picture and one star for the sound = 3 stars.The built in DVD worked good also.", "Date": "May 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Extremely poor quality, horrible customer service, If you want cheap, you got it.", "Author": "racar45", "ReviewID": "R2VX5GTYFX3ZLY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "As others have stated, the sound quality is very bad on this set. Even turned up to maximum volume, it is still difficult to hear and sounds bad. Even worse, I bought mine for my RV for camping trips, and it has to be mounted on the wall due to space. This TV is wall mountable, but if you look at the screen from any angle other than dead center, the faces and backgrounds are all bluish black. No setting on the television will eliminate the problem. I tried them all. I reported the picture quality issue (when wall mounted) to the warranty department. They sent me to an authorized repair facility who checked the unit and advised that it is not repairable. They stated that this TV has a poor design and that the viewing angle is very limited. I have tried to get Haier America to replace the TV under warranty in hopes that I would get a better one without this issue. Their customer service department has been outsourced to another country somewhere overseas. The reps speak very poor English and are difficult to communicate with. They basically all read from a script that they have documented the claim and that someone will contact me within 2 business days. No one ever calls. This has been going on for several weeks. I have spoken to a supervisor on 2 occasions. The only call back I have received in this ordeal, was on a weekend, when a supervisor called just to tell me that someone would call me within 2 business days, which is what I have been told now for weeks. This company has no desire to stand behind their product. I keep being told their \"engineering\" department has to review the report from the repair facility to make a decision. They cannot tell me where the \"engineering\" department is located, and they have no phone number for them. I picked my TV up from the repair facility several weeks ago, unrepaired and it looks like I am stuck with it and will have to pay for a defective set that is not watchable. All I can say is BEWARE. Buy a reputable brand, with a good warranty and trusted customer service standards. I will never purchase this brand again. I learned a lesson from this mistake.", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good compact TV", "Author": "mattryan2", "ReviewID": "R1WFT4024QOYQC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The TV is as advertised but as was indicated in the reviews section, the audio is a bit muffled.

Tango \"book and movie junkie\"", "ReviewID": "R3IFR8DW7RG9H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this product in white from another site (wanted it to match my room) and have had it for just over 2 years. In that time I did have to send it out for repair because the dvd player would freeze and skip randomly. I purchased this solely for the DVD player combo, because I do not have a cable connection in my room. Now, 2 years and 3 months later (and 3 months out of my warranty) the DVD player has stopped recognizing discs altogether. I realize this is an affordable tv, especially with the DVD player built in, but I expect a product that I paid over $200 for to last more than 2 years. The picture quality is great, the sound is fine (dunno what that other guy is talking about), and the look and size of it is great. I'm just very disappointed with the shelf life. I will see if a repairman can fix it, but I'm assuming it will be expensive since it is an off brand.
