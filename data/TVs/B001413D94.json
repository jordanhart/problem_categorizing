{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Simply Amazing", "Author": "Winston", "ReviewID": "R1YKOM0X7LCMFN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got my TV last Friday and it is everything that I have expected.  Unlike the first reviewer on this site, I have not experienced the overheating issues (fingers crossed).  If you read his review he did admit the TV was great until that started happening.  I just hope I don't get the same issue.On to my review: I spent over a year and a half researching flat panels.  I came close to purchasing a Samsung 71F series, but when the salesman told me that new 2008 models were coming out in March, I decided to hold and do more research on those models.  I almost purchased the 5 series, but when I found out that it does not have 120hz refresher rate, I decided to research the 6 series and ended buying the 46A650.I briefly looked at the 7 series, but when I found out the only difference between the two was that the 7 series has a USB port for your MP3 player and 1 GB of cache, I figured it was not for me.  I use a dock connected to my receiver when I play my MP3, so to me that was a useless function to fork over extra $$$ for.  In addition, I have a PS3 so I don't really need the 1GB of cache to use the TV as a multimedia center.  If you don't have a PS3 and plan to use your TV to view pictures and play music then the 7 series might be for you.Pros:I have the 46\" and I was amazed at how light it was.  I was able to pick it up by myself and put it on the stand.  The red is absolutely amazing.  That's the favorite thing my Fianc\u00e9e likes about this TV.  Personally, I like the red because it is very subtle and goes great with our family room.The first night we got it we watched the movie Ratatouille on Blu-Ray Disc.  Let me tell you after watching the movie my jaw was sore because I think I spent more than 3/4ths of the movie with my jaw open from the amazing picture.  The picture was so clear and concise that we paused it and we were able to even see the little freckles on the mice throughout the movie, including the separate hairs.As I said earlier I play video games with my PS3, so the 120 hz refresher rate was critical to have.  MLB the Show 08 is insane.  Just looking at the players faces and even the fans blew me away.  My brother has a 46\" inch Vizio 1080P and he recommended it to me saying that there is not much difference from the two so I am better off saving.  Let me tell you, he is absolutely wrong.  I've watched his Vizio and to be honest, it can't even hold the jockstrap of the 46A650 if it was a male.  There is a big difference believe me.  The only TV that could probably match-up to this one is the XBR Bravia with 120HZ.  That would've been what I would have purchased if I had not gotten this one.  Up until now, I have absolutely no regrets.The reason I researched for over a year and a half is because I wanted to get a TV that if something new came on the market a few months later, I would not regret my purchase.  I feel very strongly that I will not regret this purchase down the line.I love having 4 HDMI inputs.  This was very important for my purchase also, since I have separate HDMI components.  The TV also has an ethernet port, so I have it plugged into the internet.  I can get weather, news and stock quotes through it.  I'll admit, I haven't used it much, but it's nice to know, I can check the temperature at the touch of the button.The blacks on this TV are awesome and I can have my curtain open on my huge family room window and I can see the tv clearly during the day.  I love the TruSurround feature, since right now I only have two speakers and a subwoofer.  This feature is meant to improve the sound quality for people who use two speaker systems.  I plan to get a surround sound system eventually, but it's going to be a while.  That's where this tool comes in handyThe screen is glossy, but I don't have an issue with it.  I like the glossy look and besides, it is meant to make the colors more vibrant and intense.  I've played with the different viewing modes, but actually, I like standard the best.  The movie mode is a little too dark for me and the game one is a little too bright.  Standard mode is my desired preference.The remote is oddly shaped and takes a while to get used to. It also has an ipod like scroll.  Some people complain that it is an ugly remote.  This is ridiculous; I'm sorry, but I did not purchase this TV for its remote.  Anyway, I'm planning on upgrading to an RF Logitech remote this summer anyway.Cons:The TV is so good that on the tv stations with weak signals, you can see the weakness of the signal.  On some you could see the lines and imperfections, due to having a weak signal.  That is only a with a few channels.  It's a negative, but that's what you get when the picture is very detailed; You will not only get the good qualities, but the bad also, if the signal is not strong.  Regardless, that issue will be moot next year when the tv stations will be required to broadcast by digital signal.Another issue is, that when you turn it on it takes about 3-4 seconds to pick up my digital cable signal from my DVR box.  In addition when you switch between sources it takes around the same amount of time to pick up the signal.  I'm impatient, which is a negative quality of mine. In our household, it seems like it is an issue only with me, since it does not bother my fiancee at all or any of our friends.  Maybe it would not be a con if I was not so stupidly impatient.Those are really the only two issues I have with the TV and to me they are very minor ones.  I just pray I don't start getting the issues, the first reviewer experienced.Overall:I am very happy with my purchase.  I am very satisfied and do not feel guilty or have any regrets about making this purchase.  Up until now, I feel this TV is worth every penny I paid for it.  I'll be updating my review as I learn more about this TV.  I hope my review helped you, even if it was only a tad bit helpful, before making your investment on a flat panel television.  Good luck with your search.", "Date": "March 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "About time, Or so I thought.", "Author": "J. Sparks", "ReviewID": "R4ZN2436I2O5Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": ":: It seems the Shut off Issue has been corrected on my set!!::Prior to picking this TV up I had 2 of the 71 series televisions. Both of them had problems concerning a flicker as well as a some dim pixel clusters under the screen. I still had my last 71 under the 30 day policy so i returned it for this years new model: the 650A.The Tv itself is beautiful. The hint of red is very subdued yet adds a nice touch when you get up close. A warning about the screen, it is glossy. If your room is well lit and you get distracted by reflections, this is not for you. The benefit of the glossy screen is more vibrant colors and contrast. SO for most its worth the glare to have a beautiful picture when you close the blinds. Though in daylight I don't have a problem at all watching it, but its optimal in dark.The remote is interesting. It has an Ipod inspired turn wheel in the middle of the remote that is super touchy. It takes some getting used to but its kind of cool. The source input is now a drop down menu where you directly choose the input rather than cycling through them one by one. It also has a motion sensor in it, when activated, auto turns the light on in the remote when its moved. People complain that its an ugly remote, but seriously, its a remote. You dont stare at it like the TV's picture.Speaking of which the picture is where the tv truly shines. Vibrant colors, amazing detail, inky blacks. This is the LCD I have been waiting for. Bluray= amazing.So the TV is very similar to the 71 except 3 new modes which are called \"Entertainment Modes\" These are Pre-calibrated from the factory and you cannot adjust the picture at all.1. Sports mode: For high speed sports. This mode is a lot brighter than the others and is designed for faced paced imagery.2.Game: This is for games obviously. The AMP feature is toned down but the Video Processor is turned up for a smoother game play. Colors are less vibrant than sports, but just a tad.3. Cinema Mode: Intended for film and is a darker more film like picture.  AMP is functioning at normal capacity. Some think this is to dark but I really think its Ideal.The best part about the Entertainment modes: No judder or stutter and TBE is fairly gone from the 71 series. These modes are amazing and should be the only modes used on the tv for smooth performance.You can read about more of the features but So far this TV has been exactly what I have been waiting for. There have been quite a few reports of random restarts, I have yet to have any. If this is a widespread problem it will be patched on the older models and will come out of the factory with the fix installed. Samsung tvs have had this problem before and it was fixed last time. I have no worries. (And it just restarted, hooray)", "Date": "March 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Amazing picture, but surprised by some missing features", "Author": "Daniel Eskenazi", "ReviewID": "R2YWDFQXHSZDOB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I want to say first off that I also experienced the bug where the TV unexpectedly turns itself off, but after I installed the firmware upgrade that Samsung posted on 4/5 the problem has gone away.I agree with the other reviewers that the picture is AMAZING. I am also happy to see that Samsung has added a 4th HDMI port. I was initially concerned that the \"Touch Of Color\" might clash with my decor, but it is very subtle especially if you mount the TV inside a cabinet. The \"Infolink\" feature is cute and easy to set up, but I don't see it as being extremely useful.Now for some caveats. I purchased this TV right after setting up an LNT4661F for my inlaws, and I was quite surprised to realize that the A650 is missing several features from the 4661F, despite the A650 costing  $650 more. For starters, the A650 does not have a rear S-video port (only one S-vide port on the side). This is probably not a big deal for most people, but if you are using a VCR or older cable box, etc. you will have a cable plugged into the side of the TV. Also there is only one composite port on the back of the TV, plus one more on the side. If you want to switch between three composite input surveillance cams, etc. you're out of luck. More of a concern to me was that the A650 has only 1 antenna input versus 2 on the 4661F. That means with the A650 you can't plug in both an antenna and a cable input. I guess Samsung figures everyone is using a set top box so they cut corners there.By far my biggest complaint is with the Remote control. Again unlike the 4661F, the A650 does NOT have a universal remote! It's essentially a TV-only remote, although it CAN control Samsung \"Anynet+\" components connected via HDMI. This seems like a big step backwards and bothers me more than the other features that were removed. Also the remote is not described on the Samsung website so I had no way of knowing that the remote had been \"de-improved\". I agree with other reviewers that the navigation wheel is horrible ... it spins freely which makes it practically useless ... you spin the dial to make your selection, then as you move your finger to press the enter button inside the scroll wheel, the wheel moves and you select the wrong value. You have to wonder \"what were they thinking?\". I've seen Happy Meal toys with better tactile feedback!Despite my criticisms and annoyance that some features have been removed, I still rated this TV as 5 stars because in my book, picture quality is by far the biggest consideration and it looks great to me. Also the aesthetics are very nice and the new features such as 4th HDMI and Infolink make up for the removed features and poor remote control.", "Date": "April 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Glare Issues", "Author": "N. Meier", "ReviewID": "R1342FSZTK4G6M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was excited to have my new LN46A650 delivered today. From what I had read from the reviews and from my other research I had one fear about the TV, reflection from the screen surface. I'm sad to report I am going to be returning my Samsung for a model with a flat/matte finish on the screen.I was really disappointed when I turned this on. The reflections from the windows were terrible.My setup has the TV on a wall which is parallel to an exterior wall with (2) 30x60 windows approximately 10 feet away. The glare IMO is unbearable, bad enough that I am willing to pay the return shipping charges. I also see quite a bit of glare from a floor lamp I have in the corner of the room. It surprises me very much that this is not an issue for more people.I went as far as taking my Westinghouse LCD off the wall in my bedroom and setting it up right next to the Samsung to compare the amount of glare between the two. The cheapy Westinghouse wins hands down. No reflections whatsoever with the Westy, but with the Samsung I can actually see my neighbors house very clearly out the window in the reflection in the screen. The reflections are worse with dark screens, but are still noticeable while watching a baseball game.The picture is the best I've ever seen, and the \"Touch of Red\" gives it a classy look, but if you have a worry about windows reflecting on the screen, I would suggest going with a model that does not have the glossy/glass finish screen. If you are building a home theater where reflection is not an issue or if you always watch TV in the dark then this is probably the TV for you. But if reflections in the screen bother you I would think long and hard before buying this TV.", "Date": "August 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "Mixed Blessings--Kudos to Amazon", "Author": "O. Manning", "ReviewID": "RFC5CFFBRDQ3I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This may seem like a strange review because while this is being typed I'm in the process of returning the television.This television was delivered via Amazon's White-Glove Service.  It arrived earlier than promised, everything to the point of turning on the television went flawlessly.  (+ points to Amazon).Immediately upon turning it on I was struck by two things.  First, the picture was absolutely stunning.  Second...there appeared to be a problem because the display showed patterns of small fluorescent green dots that clustered around changes of color.  It looked much like \"poor reception snow\" except it was green...and it only appeared in certain colors (lots in green backgrounds, often in flesh-tones, especially where the tones changed due to highlights, and sometimes in grays or dark colors).  This occurred no matter what the signal source was (cable, DVD, satellite) and no matter what method was used to transmit the signal (HDMI, Off-Air, Composite).I went to the manufacturer's website and went through their troubleshooting procedures...and nothing clearly matched my problem.  I looked on the internet and found evidence that this had happened to someone else and the result was Samsung sending out a repair person to fix it.  I called Samsung, explained the problem, and (voila!) I'm told the problem will require repair and they'll contact me within 48 hours to tell me when this person will come.  It was at this point things started to go downhill...when the Samsung rep suggested I could buy an \"extended warranty\".  I try to be reasonable about these things, though...so I figured I'd wait until they called me back to push matters.  After no callback at the 48 hour point, I called THEM back.  Some irritating young lady then explained to me that because I lived in a \"no service area\" they \"technically\" had 5 to 8 business days to find someone to repair the television.At this point, I'm being told by Samsung that 1) It's just my tough luck that I bought what I thought was a brand-new television and now I'll own what could more accurately described as a \"refurbished television\" 2)It's more tough luck because I live in the boonies and 3)I should give them MORE money since the tough luck mentioned above has not given me reason to believe my television may not LAST beyond the warranty period.I called Amazon to ask for help.  Amazon immediately agreed that I had a problem, my attitude wasn't unreasonable, I had tried to work it out with the manufacturer....and agreed to send me a new television and pick up the old one at the same time.I was absolutely stunned!  Thank you, Amazon.I guess the reason this is such a strange review is that I'm complaining about the manufacturer while agreeing to replace it with the same television.  Part of it is because I believe that it really was just a stroke of bad luck...the main reason is that except for this problem, I truly am very pleased with the television.I'm now especially pleased with Amazon.  They're amazing.", "Date": "August 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great value, even better TV", "Author": "D. A. Bell", "ReviewID": "R1HB6AKVF3KJ7L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this model shortly after it was first available from Amazon upgrading my older Phillips 55\" rear projection 1080i capable TV.  I have now owned it for a month.  I've used it with basic (non-HD) cable, basic Tivo viewing (again, non-HD), upscaled DVD viewing, HD-DVD viewing, and blu-ray viewing.  I've paired it with a Yamaha 3000 soundbar. My entertainment watching has never been better.Like many people I did a lot of research before dropping this kind of money on a new TV and, also like many people, it eventually came down to the Samsung TV or one of the Sony XBRs.  IMO these are the only competitive mid-range/high end flatscreens to consider for purchase.  Because of the Burn in issue (which is not as bad as it was in earlier generation Plasmas) I never considered a plasma TV, though they are a little more inexpensive and often have at least as good a picture as the LCD TVs.As you've probably read outside of the several hundred dollar premimum for the Sony brand, the primary difference is that the Samsungs have a shiny screen so in high light rooms there can be some reflection vs the matte XBR screens.  I generally can control the light levels while I'm viewing the TV so the vibrancy of the Samsung in mid/low light conditions made the choice easier.I was originally going to go with a 4671f until I saw the \"new\" 46A650 model and decided to get the new version instead.  There have been some visual quality improvements with the second generation of the motion tracking technology which goes a long way to eliminating the blurring and object duplication (the \"Triple Ball Effect\" or TBE).  It isn't entirely gone but for a \"normal\" person who isn't examining the visuals in minute detail; it is effectively a non-issue now.  I've seen a couple sutters where the image seems to \"jump\" but in my opinion this is more related to the media/movie than a problem with the TV.If you ask someone who says that the TV has a stuttering problem they will usually only be able to point to one scene in a movie or two where the stuttering occurs (\"Check the intro sequenece in Blue Planet from 00:01:23 to 00:01:24!  This TV stutters like mad!\").I contend that normal people can handle a 1 second stutter every 100 hours of viewing :)*VISUALS*The visuals on blu-ray content are often jaw dropping.  This is to be expected with something like \"Planet Earth\" which is built around its lush visuals, even in non-HD, but even some scenes in movies that I wouldn't consider prime HD material I am often very impressed (there are some garden scenes in \"Walk Hard\" that are eye-popping!).Of course the non-HD experience isn't incredible, but I'm happy that it is at least on par with my old TV.  Eventually I may decided to upgrade to HD cable and Tivo but my main focus is improving my movie watching, not necessarly making CSI or American Idol look better.Finally, I have three spots in my TV room where people watch TV from.  With some LCDs if you get too far off center from the set then the screen dims and the vitality of the colors bleeds down.  That is not a problem at all with this LCD.*PHYSICAL*On the hardware end there are plenty of inputs for HDMI and any other connection type you can think of.  I have a full set of components and everything plugs right in and works well.I was a little wary of the \"Touch of Color\", but in a darker room it is not very obtrusive since it fades quickly to deep red which looks black in lower light.  I think the red highlight actually looks really cool!  It is much more pleasing to my eye then just a plain black or silver.I am so pleased with this TV I can barely describe it!  Physically it looks stunning, visually it is one of the best out there.*CONS*Not everything is rosy though.There was a problem with some of the original models where the TV would randomly shutoff (mine included, though I did not encounter it often).  This is easily fixed with a firmware update available off Samsungs site and is, presumably, pre-loaded on all the new sets being manufactured.The remote is not great.  It has the buttons you want to do everything but the jog/shuttle wheel implementation they used is too sloppy and leads to a lot of inaccuracy.  I over came this by purchasing a Logitech Harmony One remote but for using the PS3 I still have to resort to the included remote (the PS3 remote is bluetooth and doesn't work with the Harmony remote).One of the biggest problems that I have is that the TV is meant to be best viewed in lower light settings, however the labels for the controls on the TV itself can't be seen except if bright light.Even worse they are very sensitive touch controls so when I want to turn the TV off manually I often end up changing the channel instead because I miss the \"off\" touch region by a little.  Then I either have to turn on a bunch of lights to change the channel again and then turn it off or I have to dig out the remote to change the channel and turn the set off.  This is so annoying that I've resorted to keeping a small keychain flashlight beside the TV just so I can see these stupidly subdued labels.Finally, the software/interface for adjusting the settings on the TV is slow and unresponsive.  This is excrabited by the crappy remote.  It seems that moving through the menus and selecting settings is very laggy, and I found that I often ended up selecting items I didn't want because of the three second lag between pressing the button and actual acceptance of the setting selection.  This is also pretty minor but frustrating non-the-less during the first few days when you're tweaking settings.The problems I have with the set are so small I think I can fully justify the 5 star rating but the labeling on the controls is VERY frustrating and the remote feels all but useless if you have to rely on the Jog wheel.EDIT: One last thing:*SHIPPING*I was VERY VERY VERY disappointed in the shipping company (Eagle/CAVA) used to ship my TV.  When the driver got to my home he proceeded to DRAG my brand new $2600 TV (after tax) by the banding straps.  Bouncing it off the back of the truck onto the street, then DRAGGING it onto the curb, BOUNCING it again, then dragging up my driveway, BOUNCING it UP the three stairs to my door and finally dragging into the living room.I had thought that I was getting white glove delivery but the driver turned to leave as soon as he bounced the TV into my viewing room.  I asked him to help me at least lift it out of the box.  So he tears indacriminately into the box with his knife and starts trying to lift the TV out by pressing on the corner of the screen itself, not the bezal!I was shocked.  I will NEVER do business with a company that employs this shipping company again.  The callous attitude of the driver and the lack of respect for my package was horrid.", "Date": "April 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "RANDOM SHUT OFF ISSUE FIXED", "Author": "S. D.

Although I have only used it for one week, it is a night-and-day difference from my smaller 32\" LG HDTV I purchased in 2006.  This TV really lives up to the reviews I found on the net.  The picture is simply stunning...Deep blacks - this LCD rivals plasmas for its black levels.  Black levels are extremely important in an HD set, arguably one the most important features in determining its overall picture quality.  This thing puts out absolutely gorgeous black levels, very deep and \"inky\".  My old set had very poor black levels, never really going below a dark grey color.  As soon as I powered this Samsung set on, the difference (even right out of the box at factory settings) was drastic.  The 50,000:1 contrast ratio and 4ms response times add to the quality as well.  For a nice review detailing the picture, Google for CNET's review of the LN52A650 (the 52\" version, same TV).  They called the picture one of the best LCDs they have ever reviewed.The 120hz mode works well, if you like the effect.  Personally, I do not like it at all.  It detracts from the film feel of a movie, and feels fake and processed.  When watching Discovery HD, HD sports or something like that, I could see how you may want to use it, but I prefer watching HD content as delivered.I have it paired with both a Toshiba HD-DVD player as well as a PS3.  Both pictures are just phenomenal, especially the PS3.  The 1080p resolution, combined with the 1080p/24 mode the PS3 outputs, is striking (yes, this TV does 1080p/24, Google it to learn more about why 1080p/24 is important).Overall, I cannot say that I have found much wrong with this TV.  During high motion camera pans or intense action I have notices some very minor \"judder\", but nothing that would prevent me from recommending this TV to everyone.As other reviewers have stated, this TV does have a red tint around the bezel (dubbed \"Touch of Color\" by Samsung).  I worried about this initially, as I prefer a single, black color to a bezel.  Don't let it fool you, the red is VERY subdued in the frame, really just more of a highlight than anything (and only apparent if you are looking for it, or if the light hits it just right).  I think it does make the TV look distinguished, and is something I started liking about 5 minutes after I saw it.  The best way to sum up the color is like a very, very deep red wine in a clear wine glass.  It looks black for the most part, with just a tinge of red when viewed at the right angle.  Being a wine fan (especially reds!) this makes it even more pleasing 'The sound is standard for an HDTV.  If you are watching TV, it works just fine.  Not the best sound from a TV, but nothing bad either.  Let's be honest - the sound is not why you would buy this set anyways.  Hook it up to a 5.1 receiver to match the great picture.The price has come down on this model considerably, with the announcement of Samsung's new line of HDTVs.  If you are trying to decide between this model and the a750, go for this one.  The 750 has the same specs, with more built in networking potential, recipes, etc.  Personally, I think those are just overkill and not needed anyways.  This TV does have an Ethernet port for getting live information from the Internet, though I haven't even tried it out, and may never.This set is just a pleasure to watch and you can configure it all day long.  Some sets suffer from being too \"basic\" when it comes to customizing the picture (brightness, contrast, color and not much else).  Not this one.  You can really tweak it all you want and change the picture to suit your palate.  I REALLY like the amount of choices you have when being able to adjust the picture.The remote does look kind of \"kiddy\" looking, but if you have a universal remote, you won't use it anyways.  The remote is never a deal breaker for me on TVs, and this one is no exception.  Some don't like the scroll wheel, which I can understand, but even if you don't want to use the scroll, it still functions like a standard remote by pressing up, down, left, right on the wheel anyways.As for connections, my old TV had two HDMI ports, which is just not enough.  This baby had 4 HDMI ports, 2 component inputs, VGA (for computer connections), a USB port, and Ethernet port - everything you'd need to connect it to pretty much anything you want.So overall, this TV has exceeded my expectations.  The picture quality looked even better at home than in the store.  If you are in the market for an HDTV that is a joy to watch, look no further.  I recommend this set highly.

I've called in twice after price drops and gotten two sizable refunds in the two weeks since it was shipped.I like the higher level of contrast this model has over the 550 model so I'm glad I got this 650 model but the other touted difference between the models is confusing/disappointing and that's the 120hz feature.  I've tried numerous ways viewing different sources with all sorts of settings and I can't see much, if any, difference with the 120hz turned on or off.  I don't even see a difference when the demo function is running and you're supposedly seeing 120hz on the left and 60hz on the right.  There might be the slightest difference but I might just be thinking that because I've been told there should be.  So I'm not disappointed I got this one instead of the 550 because the higher contrast makes the blacks very deep but  don't let the 120hz be the decisive factor in whether you get this set.", "Date": "June 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Absolutely AMAZING!!!", "Author": "a reviewer \"a reviewer\"", "ReviewID": "R6VZB5Y6JPMXA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just set this up.

I am so, so glad my husband talked me into the extra 400 bucks to get the 650 series.  SO worth it for the 120hz, and the red touch of color is beautiful.  I couldn't be happier!!!!

My wife & I knew it was time to release ourselves from the shackles of the Cathode Ray Tube and move forward.First, ordering & delivery were great.  I ordered the set on June 3 (a Tuesday) at night, it shipped the next day, and was delivered on Friday, June 6.  Several folks had convinced me that Amazon would take 1-2 weeks to get it here, but 2 days seems pretty good to me.Friday morning began with a trip to Ikea for some of their lovely Besta line.  2 of the 15\" shelf benches, stacked vertically, flanked by a pair of the double-wide 75\" high shelf units.  Loads of storage, and looked pretty nice too.  But I digress...  Back to the TV.I first noticed the box had a sticker noting that the updated firmware for the now notorious random shutoff issue was already loaded on the set.  Yay, now I didn't need to spend the few minutes to download, put it on a usb stick, etc.  Score 1 for the home team.  The packaging was simply magnificent.  Not sure if it's the norm for such TVs, but I liked the fact that I just had to cut 2 plastic shipping straps, pull out 2 little insert things in the side of the box, and the whole top lifted off.  Out came the TV, off with the protective bag and plastic on the base, and up it went, perched atop our newly constructed Ikea stand.The various connections are well-marked and easy to follow.  I love the fact that it's got 4 HDMI inputs.  I'm already using 2.  One for the connection to our AV receiver (a Yamaha, if anyone cares) that only supports HDMI 1.1 (so no 1080p from it), and another to a Toshiba SD-6100 Upscaling DVD player.  Also connected to the receiver is a DirecTiVo receiver (an SD model) soon to be replaced by a TiVo Series 3 with FiosTV and our Wii.  I ran a calibration wizard DVD, and found that I only needed to adjust the defaults slightly in 1 or 2 places to suit our living room. The defaults were pretty good, but needed slight adjustment for black level and brightness - something that can be largely room-dependent.The TV is very responsive, turning on almost instantly, a welcome change compared with many other HD sets I've seen.  I'm not seeing spotlighting or those funky random patterns that some claim to see on this set either.  I can't speak to the quality of the sound that comes from the TV, since I've turned off the TV speaker (all our audio runs to the receiver).If I could find nits to pick, there would be 2.  The stand and bezel seem to be dust magnets.  Hopefully this will get better as its been installed longer.  This may be due to the complete and utter disruption caused to the immediately surrounding environment. :)  The other is the remote only seems to control Samsung devices.  Not really a concern for us, as I included a Harmony One in the budget for this project.  The remote happily lives below the TV, in a drawer along with the Yamaha receiver's remote and the Toshiba DVD player's remote.  We still occasionally use the TiVo remote, but mostly the Harmony now.Unless you simply must have a Blu-Ray player now, save your pennies, and get an upscaling DVD player for now.  I'm waiting on $200 BR 2.0 players, which I expect to see in Q1 2009.The long & the short of it - a fantastic TV, great picture.

The picture is FANTASTIC, probably the most clear HDTV that I have seen on the market to date.  The 120 Hz makes the biggest difference of all.

This set is amazing.  My girlfriend and her brother are definitely not videophiles by any means and when they first saw the picture they both said, \"I don't even know what to say.  I can't imagine a better picture.\"  Her brother even said, \"I know you told me that you were getting a new tv but I never expected this.\"  Yes, it is that good.  It is a little bright out of the box but after applying CNET's settings it looks awesome.  The AMP feature on this tv might not be for everyone (I love it and usually watch everything but movies on high and I usually watch movies on low or medium) but even with it off the 120hz refresh rate helps reduce motion blur.

I looked at professional opinions as well as \"common folk\" opinion and it seemed like the clear choice (even if it wasn't clear, it sure looked like a good choice).  All was well for 13 months.  The TV was amazing, just as everyone from Amazon, Consumer Reports, CNET and other sites suggested.  The other day I turned it on and smoke started coming out of the back.  The smell was something like ozone gas which points to an electrical problem.  I immediately called Amazon and as expected they referred me to Samsung.  \"We are sorry but your warranty was up last month\" was the only comfort they could offer.  I was told it was up to me to have it fixed.  When I inquired as to whether or not they had ever heard of this problem before, I was told \"no.\"  Frustrated, I started searching on-line for suggestions on what the problem might be and how it might be fixed.  I was also interested in figuring out how much a repair might cost knowing that if it was too much, I might be faced with buying a new TV.  That was not exactly the decision I wanted to make considering that 13 months ago I spent almost $1600 on it.  Boy was I in for a surprise.  It wasn't hard to find literally 1000's of complaints against Samsung for a similar problem.  The problem relates to the power supply they use inside of the TV.  I guess it is a cheap part that they use to try to save a few dollars instead of using one that better supports the electrical needs of the TV.  Sounds crazy to try to save a few bucks when you are charging 1000's of dollars for most TVs.  I am very educated and informed, if you don't believe me, please check for yourself.  Many websites can be found to support my story.  I hope it is a matter of time before Samsung is held liable for this problem  One site I went to had over 5000 complaints for the same basic problem with Samsung yet the company continues to turn a blind eye.  Amazon should investigate this and include a disclaimer on all Samsung TVs they sell to help inform the consumer about this potential problem.

I used their calibration for my set (the 46\") and then watched a few minutes of several films --- it looked just great. I have an upconverting DVD player and it does a superb job on normal def DVDs with this set. I just set this up two days ago, so I hooked it up to basic cable service, and the standard definition quality is really quite good -- maybe better than previous generations of LCDs?

There is one newer version which I am not sure is worth bothering with right now. The manual for this TV does not describe how to check your firmware version, but what you do is find the \"SW Update\" submenu option, and then press Info on the remote. My only complaint of note is the surface is shiny and lighting in front of the set will reflect in the screen. Some experimentation with the Auto Motion Plus is recommended for your own taste. For watching films, I have set to Off. I'm not a gamer, but mostly watch films and TV broadcasts (including sports).

The TV shipped from Kentucky and I live in Minneapolis.  Can't ask for any faster service than that!  They helped unpack the TV and waited until I turned it on to make sure it was working and I was satisfied.As for the TV, I'm very pleased with the picture.  It's my first LCD HDTV and I don't think I could be happier with the overall quality.  I have a 56\" Samsung DLP in the living room and this LCD has gone in our bedroom.  The Touch of Color is VERY faint and I can only notice it when the lights in the room are on.  Even then it's not distracting at all.  It looks nice.Also, do yourself a favor and go to the AVS Forums and find the threads about this TV so you can get the display settings setup correctly.  They have a thread dedicated to calibrating the picture and it worked very well for me.  Someone created a very nice spreadsheet stating exactly what to set all the settings to and they worked very nicely.Also, this TV was practically made for Blu-ray.  Blu-ray looks amazing on this TV, even better than the 1080P DLP in our living room.  Far better than HD cable channels!  It properly displays 1080P24 content as Blu-rays were intended..  The AMP takes some getting used to.  I set it to Low because anything higher just makes the movies look unnaturally smooth.  So if you don't have a blu-ray player now, do yourself a favor and get one because NOTHING will look better on this TV than Blu-ray movies which utilize the full 1080P capabilities of this TV.My TV has the 1002.3 firmware on it (1003.M is the newest I believe) and so far there have been no resets.

We have a satellite HD receiver connected via HDMI. HD is literally like looking through a window.  It's stunning. We haven't seen Blu Ray yet, but our first experience with HD is amazing.  The colors are so crisp, the lines so clear.  Truly incredible.  History Channel, Discovery Channel, National Geographic - Wow!

We had that for a week before upgrading our satellite receiver.  It was better than I thought it would be.  And our DVD player (a Panasonic from 2000) handles the standard DVDs just fine, which is why I'm putting off purchasing a Blu Ray player or an upconverting DVD player.The sound is very good (plenty of volume) and the remote is just fine (many complaints here about it).I did have issues with CEVA shipping.  My delivery was scheduled for June 3rd and there was some drama about my TV being lost, but that was resolved by the next morning.  The delivery man came, unpacked it, set it on my stand, plugged it in and left after I said all was well.  This shipping company is very unorganized-but I was happy with the condition of my delivery.This was our first \"big screen\" TV, moving up from a 27\" tube TV.  We're very happy with our purchase.  Much cheaper than the mortar stores. And, since date of purchase, I've gotten $125 back using Amazon's Post Price Guarantee.  Even if you're in NY and have to pay tax (we got ours right before that went into effect) you'll still save money buying from Amazon.Update:  In the 3-4 weeks I owned this set I was looking for the \"auto-shutoff\" firmware glitch because my set had the original firmware.  We were pretty sure it did happen twice, but more of an issue was that the Trusurround Sound would not stay enabled.  Once you shut the TV off and turned it back on you would have to re-enable Trusurround Sound.  I called Samsung asking for the firmware on a USB drive, since I didn't have one (you can download the firmware yourself online if you have a USB drive to install it with), and Samsung insisted on sending a serviceman from HSN (Home Service Network)to look at the TV instead of giving me the firmware on a drive because it was not aware of the surround sound issue.  I was somewhat hesitant about having a serviceman come and mess around with the TV and didn't bother calling HSN. But when I got a call from HSN I set up the appointment and was pleased.  The serviceman was the most polite ever to come to my house, and he informed me that Samsung service did not always know about every software glitch and that's why they prefer to send a repairman, and that the firmware will fix this Trusurround sound glitch.  Which it did.  The point being that Samsung would rather pay more to send someone to you then to take a chance with giving you firmware you may not need.  And, if the install went awry, I'd be fully covered, of course.  I highly recommend this TV and Samsung's service.UPDATE:  8/28/08:  I started using this TV as a monitor for both a laptop and a desktop PC, connected via VGA out to VGA input.

Sony makes a great set; but the picture of this Samsung even compared to the newer XBR model was not as bright.  What I think most people want is a bright clear picture.  For the serious viewer this TV is VERY bright and clear (when a strong source signal is provided).  What I learned from the research is that picture clarity can be measured in many different ways that is really too complex to explain perfectly.  I liked many aspects of my Sony LCD, but the brightness of the Samsung LN46A650A trumps almost all other features including other aspects of picture quality.  Where this TV poses some issues is in the remote control, PIP and when a poor HD sourse is supplied.  What is happening from time to time is that unclear HD Movies are being broadcast (on cable) which no TV would be able to decode without some problems.  I think the critizism directed at this TV largely comes when a poor quality sourse signal is being broadcast.  On non HD programming this TV does a real good job of providing a clear, bright picture.  Additionally, from a regular DVD (non HD), this TV does as good or better then most.  The remote control has a funky rotary dial that takes a little getting used to; but it can be managed with some practice.  The features are strong including a feature (INFO.L) which provides access to weather, stocks and news accross the bottom or top of the screen via a Ethernet jack.  PIP dosn't allow me to access my computer and TV at the same time which I understand is a universal problem with all LCD TV's (not confirmed).  With a contrast ratio of 50,000 to 1 I must turn down the brightness in many situations.  From accross a large room the picture is stunning.  I have read that brightness is the issue that most people judge a TV by.  By this measure this TV is a 5 out of 5.  My only regret at the moment is that I didn't purchase the 52\" model.

Gagliani", "ReviewID": "R3EP04JH8D625W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not a super high-end, power user, but I like a sharp picture and I waited a long time to find something perfect in a flat screen. After all, my 2002 (old-style tube) Sony 32\" was pretty satisfactory, if incredibly deep and heavy. Would I go plasma or LCD? After much informal research, I decided on LCD. I knew I wanted to go 1080p resolution, even if I wasn't ready to take advantage in all ways. I moved in June and that gave me the excuse I needed - new space, new television. The Samsung caught my eye right away especially since Consumer Reports listed the 550 as a best buy for its price. I love Amazon - and I saw the reviews pointing me to the 650. I especially wanted the big screen for movies and NFL football (even though the Packers will never be the same without Brett Favre), so I liked the idea of the 120 Hz chip to reduce motion blur. The red Touch of Color sounded interesting, as my leather furniture is maroon. I figured it would be a nice accent. I've had the set several weeks now. Now, here's my assessment. PICTURE: to my eyes, fantastic! I looked at it in the store and it matched much more expensive SONY models (which I still like). There are many adjustments you can make, and I have only begun to tweak. The fact is that I liked the picture pretty much as it was out of the box. It is truly eye-popping! Now, I said I'm not a power user. I still use VHS (no, really) - it's still the best way to time-shift programs I'm not interested in keeping and I have plenty of tapes to recycle. I don't care what the quality is, but even these Sony tapes look pretty good. Cable television signal quality seems to vary by channel, and the better ones look stupendous. Some less so, but the TV is ready to handle anything. Darks are dark, lights are light. It's about the sharpest picture I have ever seen. I can't say much about the blur reduction yet, but after seeing some pre-season football, I'd say it works very well. I'm glad I have it, and not for that much more money. Glare is not a problem for me. My windows are perpendicular to the set and I have blinds, so I have had no issues. The only time it looks reflective is when it's off. When it's on, even lamps don't show up and affect my viewing. I have had no issues with angle, either. I have furniture angled to face it, and even a chair off to its side still seems to have a near-perfect view. SOUND: I've seen some complaints about the sound, but I find it more than acceptable for my uses. I may go surround at some point. Until then, it's full and clear, no vibration, and there's a built-in equalizer function that allows individual preferences. The only criticism I have is that in some cases (maybe dictated by channel or input) I feel as though it's too soft and I have to increase the volume way up. Or maybe I'm just losing my hearing! In any case, this is a non-issue for me. The sound is quite sufficient. ADJUSTMENTS: More than I have needed yet. I will experiment more with the settings, but I just haven't had to. It's that nice right out of the box. I've only increased contrast and brightness a bit, and changed the tint a tiny amount. Very satisfactory. REMOTE: some people don't like it. I think it's fine. The wheel doesn't throw me at all - it's a little iPod-like and I don't find it annoying at all. The functions seem well laid out, many of the buttons are large enough. Only negative is that it is very long and the underside is so rounded that it can slip off your side table or chair arm if you don't set it down carefully. A flatter underside would be useful. But that's being super picky. The basic controls (power, volume, channel) are also located on the lower right-hand corner of the set's bezel - they're invisible, but the lightest touch does the trick - neat!  INPUTS: Again, I'm not a power user. I invested in a new up-convert Sony DVD player to replace my older high-end Sony. I bought a low-cost HDMI cable here and the connection seems outstanding to me. There are plenty of inputs of all types, including a USB port. (BTW, I did not have the random power-off problem - by the time I bought the set in July, it had been fixed. But updating firmware with a flash drive seems an easy enough way to handle it and any future expansion.) APPEARANCE: I love it. The dark red is subtle but does match my furniture well and the stand I purchased (also from Amazon, see my review). I don't see any reason to pass on this set just because of the color. It's a nice accent and gives it some character. I think it's a plus. PRICE: Outstanding! I ended up saving $600 off the retail price, plus no shipping fee. This includes a $114 refund Amazon provided after I contacted them when the price dropped. The store prices were much higher, and I would have had to pay for delivery. DELIVERY: CEVA did a fine job for me. Less than a week after ordering, they called and set up a 4-hour window for the next day. They came on time near the beginning of the window, and two gentlemen carried in the TV, set it on my temporary stand, removed the box after asking if I wanted it, and waited for me to plug in the set and inspect the screen. Again, outstanding! BOTTOM LINE: I am VERY happy with the television, with the purchase, with the delivery, and with Amazon. I'm not getting a check from any of these companies, by the way. I'm just a happy user. I think everyone but the highest-end users will absolutely love this LCD set, and it's probable that even they would. You can spend more, but for the money this is the definitely the best picture I found.--W.D.

The glossy screen also looks better assuming you can place the TV in such a way as to avoid glare.  I have four windows in my living room, and so far have not had any problems with glare.  The picture quality is just gorgeous.  The colors are vibrant and the blacks are more true than on any LCD I've ever seen.  The default backlight setting was a bit too bright and caused some eye strain when watching in an otherwise dark room, so I turned it down a few notches.  For a while, I debated getting a 40\" screen, but ultimately decided on the 46\" and am glad I did.  It's like having a window into the movie, rather than being aware that you are watching it on a TV.  The Auto Motion Plus feature helps sometimes, but other times it can be too distracting (as others have said, it makes everything look like a soap opera).  I keep it on low when it looks nice, and switch it off otherwise.  One minor annoyance is that the AMP feature is buried under a few layers of the menu, so it takes some effort to switch it on and off.  A shortcut button on the remote would have been nice.The WiseLink feature is nice in theory, but attempting to view a slideshow of 7-megapixel photos from a USB flash drive was painfully slow.  It took several seconds to load each photo, and the TV does not automatically rotate photos that contain rotation flags in their metadata.  Plus the awkward remote (which others have mentioned) makes it tedious to navigate through the slideshow.  It's easier to just hook up my computer via HDMI and view the slideshow that way.  Be aware that you can buy high-quality HDMI cables for dirt cheap. I got a 25-foot DVI-to-HDMI cable to connect my computer to the TV for $20 and it works perfectly. There is no reason to buy Monster Cables or any other \"premium\" brand.Delivery:I placed the order from Amazon on a Thursday evening, and the TV was delivered the following Wednesday around noon by CEVA.  They gave me a 4-hour delivery window (10 AM to 2 PM), but there was really no way I could take that much time off from work, so I asked them to make sure the driver would call me about half an hour before he arrived at my apartment.  Turns out he only called me 10 minutes in advance.  Luckily, I only work about 10 minutes from home, so I rushed over and found them waiting for me.  They brought the TV in, unpacked it, set it up, turned it on and made sure it was working.  Although they could have taken the packaging away, they suggested that I keep it for a few days until I was sure there were no problems with the TV, which was fine since I knew of a nearby cardboard recycling drop-off.Customer Service:Within the first week after my purchase, the price of the TV dropped by $60.  I sent an email to Amazon through their customer service web site, and within 5 minutes I had received a confirmation that my price-guarantee credit would be issued immediately.  Couldn't have been smoother!  Additionally, I used my Amazon Visa card to make the purchase, so I will receive a couple of gift certificates as a result of the reward points from this purchase.  I'll put those toward buying a PS3.  :-)", "Date": "July 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Lives Up To The Hype", "Author": "Tim Ryan", "ReviewID": "RVJNHKKGTIDYO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I purchased a Samsung LN46A650 last week based upon the Amazon customer reviews and Consumer Reports.The product was shipped via CEVA then via \"UP Special Delivery\".  One tip about UP Special Delivery, make sure you ask the driver to stay until your TV is unpacked (no cracked screen), turned on, and confirmed working.  The delivery guy was hinting he wanted to leave as soon as he got it in the house.  The drivers are not experienced in setting up electronic equipment.  I downloaded the PDF manual prior to delivery and did my homework to speed up the \"In home setup\" that was included with delivery per CEVA.This is our fist HD TV and the picture is simply gorgeous.  Unbelievable clarity and true dark blacks.  I'm a computer graphics freak so I'm extremely critical when it comes to clarity of LCDs and the Samsung LN46A650 has done nothing but impress me.  This TV is as good or better than most plasmas I've seen.  Our HD channels are so clear that is takes some getting use to. It almost makes me nauseous during busy motion scenes.  The movie \"Live Free Or Die Hard\" is insanely clear.  Bruce Willis looks like he's standing outside a window (our TV). The TV even upgrades\\converts our standard DVD movies so they look like HD, super clear!  In fact, my standard DVD movies look so great I'm considering not purchasing a PS3 (for Blu-ray player).  I compared playing our standard DVD movies along side my neighbor's PS3 (Spider-Man 3 on Blu-ray) and it was very hard to tell the difference.  The touch of red border is beautiful but subtle. It looks like a deep cherry that fades into black as it gets closer to the LCD panel.Our TV has never sporadically shutdown because it shipped with the firmware update already applied, which means no USB key was included.  Plus, Samsung customer support is simply awesome, so far.  I've called support three times, twice pre-purchase and once post-purchase and I promptly received polite and knowledgeable answers to my questions.The TV does take about 5 seconds to boot up and detect connected media but who cares!

Here's Why", "Author": "wildcatgoal", "ReviewID": "R2O7QKU3RYZFH0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this TV!  The picture quality is incredible, it has the right amount of connections, and the sound quality is strong.  Read other reviewers' posts to get a feel for its many positives.  There are a few things, though, that other reviewers didn't mention that I'd like to expose to potential owners.Missed it By That Much: \"InfoLink\"Think of this as Yahoo! Widgets or the Windows Sidebar for a TV.  It has three widgets only: weather, news headlines, and stocks.  This is a really nice tool to have, especially the weather feature.  The problem is, whenever the InfoLink service is open, not only is the Weather/Headlines/Stocks widget up in its respective location, but there is also a bright blue USA Today menu on the top left of the screen.  I thought at first this menu was there just to select which widgets you wanted to engage and then it would fade away or there would be an option to release it manually so it goes away.  Nope!  It's huge, it's annoying, its useless, and it makes the really cool InfoLink tool useless.  This is really unfortunate.  I didn't pay $2,000 for a TV that has built in USA Today advertising!Also, with regards to InfoLink, the Stocks tool is cumbersome.  You cannot type in the tickers you want, you have to literally flip through a long list of every single stock ticker InfoLink knows about!  They are split up in multiple alphabetical sections (A-C, D-F...) but within each section there are still tons of tickers.  There is no quick way of flipping through each of them.  You have to use the iPod-like spin wheel to do so and, though it's a nice tool to have on a remote control, it isn't nearly fast or accurate enough for the Stocks tool.  This tool would have been great if you could just type in the ticker symbol you want in a similar way to typing a text message on a cell phone.  But because you have to slowly run through tickers, it doesn't make the cut.A Cut Corner: the Optical Audio-out PortSince I haven't yet bought a receiver with HDMI-switching (because frankly I don't feel I need one), I need to use the optical audio-out port to get sound from my TV (and all that is connected to it via HDMI cables like a PS3) to my receiver.  My receiver only has one optical port.  The TV is capable of doing this, but only in basic stereo.  The only time the TV will transmit Dolby coding to the receiver is when you are watching a DTV channel.  If you are watching a BlueRay movie, have the player HDMI-connected to the TV, and want the surround sound coding to be transmitted to the receiver, you're out of luck unless you directly connect the optical audio cable from the player to the receiver.  I find this ridiculous.  It couldn't have been that hard for Samsung to pass-through the surround sound coding from the HDMI cables through the optical audio connection, if it is in use.None of these annoyances are a deal-breaker.  This is a really, really, really great TV.  I only give it 4-stars because of these annoyances which I consider oversights and/or cut-corners by Samsung.

In a darker room, you cannot see the red tint of color at all. The design itself makes this TV very attractive.The ONLY thing that annoys me is the remote control. Everything about it is great except for the wheel. It can be useful, but it is very situation.

I can't think of one flaw on this set. Ordered from Amazon on Tuesday and got it on Friday delivered straight to my 3rd floor apartment. Worked from the start, no issues whatsoever.Hooked up my cable set top box (component), Xbox 360 (component), and my old PC to it (pc video cable). Turned on the TV and my jaw dropped in awe. I replaced an old tube RCA 36\" TV and I did ALOT of research before I bought this Samsung LN46A650. I wanted to make sure I had at least the same picture size in height as my old TV which it did, if not slightly more. I sit about 11 feet away from the TV and everything is crystal clear. The colors are vibrant, the blacks are black, the whites are white. I'm just amazed at how great the picture looks and this is at 1080i.I got Time Warner Cable with the HD DVR cable box they supply and the HD channels look incredible. Most of my favorite channels are in HD and hopefully they'll continue adding more. I've been recording everything from HBO to Discovery channels and rewatching every movie and it's a whole new experience with this tv.As for gaming with the xbox 360, I dusted off all my old games and enjoying it so much more in widescreen, clear, vibrant colors. Everything looks smooth. Graphics are amazing. Same goes with the PC. The only problem is that the video card on my old PC can't handle the 1080 so when I tried to play World of Warcraft on it, my fps was very low. You'll need the latest video card to run stuff in 1080 but browsing and even writing emails is just amazing to see on a 46\" widescreen as I am doing right now.As for the \"red touch of color\", I was concerned it would stand out too much but you can't notice it at all unless you're very close to the set. I think Samsung did a great job with adding a little flair to the set with the added red and it doesn't get in the way at all.I just ordered a few HDMI cables (9 cents each). My only regret is that the XBox 360 doesn't have Blu-ray.

We did countless hours of research and price comparisons, as well as visits to brick and mortars like Fry's to see what these sets were all about. In the end, the Samsung 650 stood head and shoulders above the rest: price, it being an LCD, the 50K:1 contrast ration, 120 Hz refresh rate, and its visual aesthetic (the red beveling) were our main reasons for choosing this particular set.We purchased the set on a Saturday. On Sunday we received notification that it had shipped via courier (CEVA, I believe). By Tuesday the set had arrived at the closest major airport, and CEVA called and emailed to arrange delivery. The only hiccup was that they initially delivered a day before they were supposed to, but we rescheduled with little fanfare. Once it arrived, we unwrapped the packaging and had it up and running within 30 minutes, without even reading the manual. Pretty amazing, really. I would recommend getting some cheap HDMI cables (Premium Gold Series 6ft / 2m Hdmi 1.3 Certified Cable for Ps3, Blu-ray) via Amazon unless you want to spend $50+ at a box store like Target. Also consider some sort of mounting system (Sanus VMPL50B Universal Flat Panel TV Wall Mount Bracket, Black).

I am using the TV connected to HDTV sources from DirecTV and a PlayStation 3.Things I like:Picture Quality - I have been very happy with the picture quality for both HD and SD sources (although my primary viewing is HD).TOC - As mentioned in various other places, the red TOC (touch of color) is very subtle and doesn't in any way detract from my viewing.  It does make the TV look just that much better when it's not on versus a traditional plain gray TV.Minimal Setup - I tweaked a few settings, but overall I have been happy with the ease of use and didn't have to spend a lot of time to get a good picture.Buttons (or lack of physical buttons on the TV) - The \"buttons\" for this TV are built into the glass on the right side of the bezel (towards the bottom).  So you touch that spot on the bezel to activate the buttons (similar to the power and eject buttons on the PS3).  Makes for a very clean look.Swivel base - I originally thought I would have to mount the TV on the wall, but the swivel base has worked out very well and easily swivels from side to side so I can turn the TV to be viewable in the family room or from the kitchen. The base is sturdy and the swiveling is solid (it stays put wherever you swivel it to).Things I don't like:Although the TV has PIP, it will only work if one of the sources is the internal TV tuner (in other words, if you use two external sources like my setup with DirecTV and a PS3), you cannot use the PIP.Like most HDTV's, the digital audio out does not support AC3 except for the internal tuner (TV broadcasts). This is standard DRM protection, but still annoying.Source switching on the TV is kind of a pain.  I haven't found a way to directly switch to a second source on the TV.  Instead, you have to hit the source button (on the remote or on the TV) to bring up a list of sources.  You then hit the button again and it switches to the next \"active\" source (it apparently is looking for input on each source). You keep doing this til you get to the source you want.  You then hit the \"select\" button to switch to that source and finally the \"return\" button to remove the source menu display to return to TV viewing.  For me and my two sources, this isn't that bad, but it is annoying.  For example, to switch from the DirecTV to the PS3, you have to press source twice (once to bring up the onscreen source menu and the second time to go from DTV to PS3), then Select, then Exit.  To go to from the PS3 to the DirecTV, you have to hit source *three* times (the first brings up the source menu, the second skips to the \"antenna\" input (even though I don't have one hooked up; I haven't found a way to disable it either) and a third time to get to the DTV source (then Select, then Exit). Think of the sources in a circle with Antenna being #1, DTV being #2, and PS3 being #3.  You can only move around the circle in one direction, so to go from 2 to 3, it's one step, but to go from 3 to 2, it is two steps (through #1 and then to #2).  With only two sources, it is only annoying to me.  If you had more than two, this could be a big deal.  Regardless, I would definitely recommend a receiver with AV switching to avoid switching via the TV.Also, because it handles only \"active\" sources, I have to remember to turn on the PS3 first and then switch the TV source, otherwise, PS3 won't be an option in the source selection menu.Things I don't useAs mentioned above, I don't use the OTA antenna for HDTV (or even SD), nor do I use cable, so I can't speak to how well the tuner works.InfoLink - This is Samsung's web content / RSS service.  To be honest I haven't even hooked up the TV to an ethernet cable to get to the internet.  It appears the service uses a pre-canned set of content, so I didn't really see the point for my use (since I can get the same info through DTV or the PS3 with media sharing).Non-HDMI inputs - I only have the two inputs and both are connected via HDMI, so I cannot speak for the component, s-video, etc other inputs the TV supports.Speakers - I turned on the TV speakers when I first set up the TV and they seemed to be fine. Since I have it connected to a receiver with 5.1 output, I don't use the TV speakers (and there is a setup option to turn them off (so you don't have to turn the volume all the way down or use the mute button).OverallOverall I am very happy with the purchase and the TV.

Lovin' it and cannot wait for football season to start!!!****]After two months of exhaustive research into every aspect of HDTV's, I'm very happy I went with the Samsung LNA650.  Thanks to many of the reviewers here who took the time to share their impressions and experiences in detail.  The overwhelming number of positive reviews was a factor in my decision process.Now for my own thoughts.  First, the one negative (and its big enough to deduct one star):  These glossy LCD screens which add so much depth, clarity, and rich contrast, are devilishly hard to keep in pristine condition.  The Samsung website recommends Screenclean on the FAQ section for this TV, but I had pretty poor results with it on a matte screen Samsung LCD.  My plan is to tell guests right when they come in to NOT TOUCH THE SCREEN!  And to dust a lot with a high quality microfiber cloth.  And, if, heaven forbid, any smudges get on the screen, I'll do my best with distilled water, then, for better or worse, Screenclean, and finally, a bit of Philips Screen Cleaner.  If worse comes to worse, I'd try a 30% solution of isopropyl alcohol in distilled water.  The less cleaning with any fluid the better.My wife does a lot of stir frying, and I've convinced her to turn the temperature down and to use less oil.  I think the biggest problem for these screens is residue building up over time from activities like cooking.The TV does NOT come with a cleaning cloth for the screen!  The provided cloth is for the frame only.  You must buy the best microfiber cloth you can find.  (The one that comes with the Screenclean seems pretty good.)And be sure to wash your microfiber cloth BEFORE first use very carefully with a drop of good car-washing liquid (e.g. Meguiar's), then rinse again and again with distilled water!One last cleaning thing:  Testing the abrasiveness of a cloth on a new, blank CD might be a way to know if your cloth will scratch your TV.  Just an idea I had and also found floating around the Web.I bought an Egyptian cotton T-shirt flat-sheet to use as a cover when we are away.Now for the fun part, watching this beauty.  I did try several of the settings from around the Web, but found that these must be based on individual preferences.  Each movie needs tweaking, and most of the settings depend room lighting, which in most cases changes throughout the day.  But I am happy to find that, even with a movie that has a wide range of lighting, like THE DUCHESS, I can get it EXACTLY right within a few minutes.  (If planning a movie night for friends, I'll be sure to get the settings right BEFORE the movie starts.)Having separate settings for the different inputs is a true blessing.The sound from the set itself is adequate for our one-bedroom apt's living room, and when we are doing dishes or cooking, voices are plenty loud and clear while we watch the TV from our kitchen though the pass-through.  In fact, it's just about perfect sound for newscasts from CNN, MSNBC, etc.  However, sound effects are sacrificed for the speech clarity, and movies just aren't impressive with the TV speakers.  With a screen that truly makes us feel as if we are in a cinema, I just had to get a surround sound system (and went with the Yamaha RX-V363, Sony main and surround speakers, a Polk center speaker, and no woofer because of neighbors).Many have complained about not being able to use the TV's speakers as the center sound because of the echo from combining TV + AV receiver.  However, I find that movies are actually enhanced, that the sound field is deepened a bit, by keeping the volume level of the TV very low, just at the threshold of hearing.  For us, it makes the sound deeper and more spacious, which is great when a scene is set in a large room or outside.  But we couldn't do without that center speaker for clear dialog when using the AV receiver.For old classic movies from the 30's and 40's, the sound is also quite sufficient to enjoy the dialogue easily.Our sofa is about 8.5' back from the TV.  Just right to get that feeling of having to look from left-to-right and up-and-down while watching movies--like in the cinema.The color is rich and as natural as a TV can show, better than I had hoped for, as is the contrast.Motion in action movies seems natural.  Sometimes I like the Auto-Motion (set at low) for movies, sometimes not sure.  I'm glad the option is there.  For regular TV viewing, like news, sports, reality shows, it usually looks great.  For series stuff in HD, it's a toss-up.The only hint of judder comes very rarely in medium-speed sweeps across detailed landscapes, but that same judder happens occasionally in the cinema and on plasmas that I've seen.When Auto-Motion is on, in scenes with very fast action in a setting with many objects, such as  jungles or tangles of ropes, machinery, etc., I do barely notice a slight rippling effect around the moving objects.  Sort of like a transparent force field being hit for a moment.  It's only noticeable from the corner of my eye.  I think the overall value, the sharpness, and the color make up for this slight flaw in the LCD technology that pops up infrequently on this great set.  And the rippling can be eliminated completely by simply turning off Auto-Motion.I read yesterday that Pioneer is going out of the plasma business altogether.  I did look at them while considering this purchase, but the negligible improvement over this Samsung was not worth $1000 more.  I'm very glad that I didn't go with a set that is the last of its kind.  and yes I thought about the Panasonics, but their reported problem with 1080i processing, the standard resolution for cable, troubles me.  Being an IT engineer, sometimes I have to go with the better circuitry.So part of my decision to go with this was concluding that the Samsung has the best processors in the business right now.  And if you can bring some of your own DVD's to a place like BB and try the A650's, you will see how great the picture quality is.  (The display loops that BB uses on all their TV's at once is of some value, but you really need to try some of your own DVD's to be sure.)Standard definition cable can look horrible.  Channels vary a lot.  Disney and TNT are the standouts on our Cox system.  If you plug the cable directly into the set, you might get several high def channels in the digital range of 100+ like we do.  These, naturally, are stunning.  (This TV takes a LONG time to auto-program the channels!!!)Our Scientific Atlanta Explorer 4240 HD set top box allows the user to adjust the upscaling for standard def.[****After two weeks of using the cable box, I believe that setting it to 720p is the best compromise for making the best of the standard def channels while preserving very sharp high def images.  Occasionally, if I know I'll be watching mostly 1080i sources from Cox, I'll switch the box to 1080i, but usually, like I said, the 720p is fine.  Trying to push the standard def too hard makes them look worse than settling for 720p, in my experience.****]In any case, Turner Classics is a weak performer on Cox.  Maybe it's the source material, but the same old movies on DVD look fantastic.Which brings me to my last note about how well it displays standard definition DVD's.  With newer movies, like FLAGS OF OUR FATHER, THE DUCHESS, SPIDERWICK, it is awesome.  These movies are all dual-layered (DVD-9).  Cinema quality, truly.  (I'm using the Sony NS700H Upscaling DVD Player.)  I feel absolutely no need to upgrade to Blu Ray, what with the ridiculous prices and still limited number of titles.  Just try a good upscaling DVD player.  (Plus many of the Blu Ray players are still stripped of features, like multi-disc auto-resume, for instance.)Old DVD's look very good too.  Take the old, unrestored versions of the Marx Brothers movies, for example.  Even on a 24\" CRT they look pretty bad.  But on the Samsung, you can tweak your settings to make these look quite close to how they looked on reels on a projector.  Grainy, old black-and-whites benefit from the Auto-motion set on low, in my opinion.To conclude, I'm stoked.  I feel very lucky in these economic times to be able to afford the set.  I went with Amazon because of 12 years of great treatment.  Of course other online sites might have slightly lower prices, but I am happy to pay a few bucks more to order directly from Amazon because of the customer service.Our CEVA delivery experience was excellent.Whatever you end up getting, enjoy!", "Date": "February 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Amazing Picture!

The 650 model is $300 more than the 550 but just blows it away in contrast.  It's not nearly as shiny and mirror like as I thought. 60% less than a projection monitor it replaced.  But, if you need matte you need it but otherwise this is perfect.  Sony, not sharp enough.  LG, gray black levels. Mitsubishi, poor repair record.  Sharp, crap.  Panasonic, gray blacks, poor color.  Some of those other brands also have poor side colors but that didn't matter that much to me.  The Samsung definitely has a sweet spot but it should be wide enough for most rooms.The set doesn't have the widest high contrast viewing field (yes, it's a \"S\" panel).  I have a Panasonic 32\" that's much better (practically 180).  But the sweet spot on this is fairly wide at about 70 degrees. That should be enough to accommodate a full room.  The colors don't drop off, just the black level. The more off center you are the brighter the dark area gets.  But like I said, it's not bad.I did some power usage testing- The only thing that changes the power consumption is the backlight.  Backlight at 5 is 121 watts and it bascially goes up 11 watts for ever point higher.  6 is 132, 7 is 143, 8 is 154, 9 is 165, 10 is 176.  8 looks good in a fairly bright room while 5 is good for a room with just a 60 watt bulb at night.Addition:The bezel scratches WAY too easy!  Even a baby's @$$ would scratch it.  Buy a feather duster and only use that to clean it.  Even if you get spots on the bezel don't wipe them off.  The scratches are very noticeable in the light. I'd rather see the dirt spots then scratches.  Samsung really screwed up when they decided on the bezel plastic!", "Date": "January 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Marvel of Modern Technology", "Author": "Josh Zastrow \"jfzastrow\"", "ReviewID": "R1HCGBOA82RHRG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung LN46A650A is an incredible TV and a marvel of modern technology.First and foremost the picture processing power of this television is astounding. This set includes a 50,000:1 contrast ratio as well as a blazing fast 4ms response time. Equally as important is Samsung's \"Auto Motion Plus\" 120hz technology which adds frames to images and eliminates motion blur in film and television. This TV is great for the fast moving action that appears on television, video games, and movies. The LN40A650A also has 1080p/24 support which, when combined with a compatible blu-ray player, brings video imagery one step closer to recreating the original photography of film. All of these processing features combined give the LN40A650A incredible clarity and detail when compared to other LCDs and it truly has to be seen to be believed.The TV offers a plethora of inputs including 3 HDMI, 2 component, VGA, and even standard composite to satisfy all sorts of connection needs. Additional features include a unique \"InfoLink\" feature which allows the TV to grab stock quotes, weather, sports scores, and news updates from the internet when connected to a home network through the included Ethernet port. Also of note, is the \"WiseLink\" feature which allows direct view of images and play of music when a USB ThumbDrive is connected to the included USB port.The appearance of the bezel even received attention with a beautiful piano black finish that includes a hint of amber color altogether making for a great accent to home decor and giving the TV an original artistic style.The TV includes a built in tuner which for my particular location picked up all local over-the-air HDTV broadcasts without a hitch. The TV also features a \"signal strength\" meter that helps a ton when positioning your antenna.Finally, the adjustments and calibrations that this set offers are astonishing. Each input can be separately calibrated with the standard brightness, contrast, sharpness, and color options but Samsung took this one step further and offered additional options such as HDMI black level, DNIe, Auto Motion Plus, and many more, all of which can be tweaked to your particular viewing preferences for all of your connected components.There are three minor quirks with the LN46A650A that are worth mentioning. First is that the rotating directional control on the remote takes a little getting used to but isn't necessary for proper operation. Second is that early sets were prone to a \"shut-off\" issue where the television would randomly turn off. Thankfully this particular issue was immediately addressed by Samsung via a very simple firmware update from Samsung's website and it is no longer an issue. Third is that the piano black bezel does like to collect dust. If this is of concern, Samsung does include a microfiber cloth in the box which can be used to wipe down the bezel.All in all the Samsung LN46A650A is a high performing top-tier LCD TV; currently one of the best on the market in its price range. The performance and features of this set are sure to please and amaze, setting this television apart from others where it matters most.I highly recommend the LN46A650A as it truly is an incredible TV and a marvel of modern technology.", "Date": "December 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Blown away", "Author": "Patrick Miltner", "ReviewID": "R3U6KHV4AXUV88", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the first HDTV I've ever bought, and I'm utterly stunned at how beautiful 1080i and 1080p feeds are.  My primary uses for the TV were originally just going to be gaming (xbox360) and watching Blu-Ray movies, but after seeing the local news broadcast in HD, I called up my cable company and ordered an HD-DVR and HD cable because of how amazing it looks.  After seeing the Georgia Tech football game in HD, it convinced me even more.I really like the wealth of options you can change, although I found the picture settings to be perfect right out of the box.  I find myself switching AutoMotion+ on and off pretty frequently depending on what I'm doing - for normal TV and movies it looks really fake, so I turn it off, but for sports and video games it looks amazing, so that's really the only time I ever put it on (I put it at medium, sometimes the screen gets a little choppy when I put it on high... not sure if it's just my eyes playing tricks or if it's an issue with the TV).It's true, the remote is a little lame, but the remote that comes with the Samsung BD-P1500 works well with the TV and is a little better designed for basic tasks.  I mean, I bought the TV for the picture, not the remote.  No big deal.The speakers are surprisingly good.  I turned on the TruSurround feature and I'm very pleased.  Of course, it can't compete with a dedicated home theater setup, but it will tide me over nicely until I decide on which HT system to buy down the road.As for the reflection issues, I have two large windows with direct sunlight that shine onto my TV screen, and while I can see a perfect reflection on the screen when the TV is off, when the TV is on the picture is so bright and vibrant that you seriously don't see any reflections at all.  The exception is when you are watching something with lots of dark colors - then you can see the reflections, but it really isn't bad enough to bother me at all.The black levels on this TV are --AMAZING--.  The deepest blacks are just as dark as the bezel around the screen, and the sheer amount of black shades this TV can produce is mindboggling... it's light years ahead of other LCDs.  I watched Sunshine on Blu-Ray and the frequent space shots (it's a sci-fi movie) were incredibly realistic because of how perfect the black levels were.  It's great for gaming, too - I played Dead Space on xbox360 for a few hours and there are frequent times when the lights go out and lighting is minimal.  On my computer's LCD screen (a Hanns-G 22 incher) I could barely see anything because of how bad the black levels used to be, but on this Samsung I can see everything perfectly without any of the washed-out black levels I was used to on the other screen.  Simply beautiful.The touch-of-color looks cool when the TV is off, but I never even notice it unless I'm consciously looking for it.  It's a purely aesthetic thing, and it adds to the glossy beauty of the screen and bezel.Connectivity is perfectly adequate, and it's very easy to navigate inputs.  No cons here.My only true complaint about this TV isn't even confined to just this TV - it's more so for all HDTVs.  This is my first HDTV, and I was worried when I kept reading that non-HD (standard definition) broadcasts look bad on HDTVs.  Well, they were right.  Regular cable channels look really bad on HDTVs, but HD cable channels are unbelievably pretty.  It's kind of strange how bad some of the non-HD cable channels look, but I can say that as bad as they look on this Samsung, they actually look better on here than on any other HDTV I researched.  I looked at a Polaroid and a Phillips LCD HDTV with non-HD cable broadcasts and it was truly unbearably bad.  With this Samsung, it's only slightly disappointing.  So, while it's a con, this TV actually does it better than the other ones I've seen.  The only thing that can slightly rectify some of the poor standard-def quality issues is changing the aspect ratio from 16:9 to 4:3.  It looks smaller, obviously, but sometimes it makes a difference.All in all, I couldn't be more pleased with this TV.  It's truly beautiful, and I am so glad I waited to pull the trigger long enough to grab a TV like the LN46A650.  Blu-Ray and Xbox360 have never looked so amazing, and Amazon had the cheapest price hands down (it's cheap to begin with here, but the free $200 Blu-Ray player was the icing on the cake).", "Date": "November 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV, couldn't be happier.", "Author": "DH \"DH\"", "ReviewID": "R3PKTYLHGBCYE8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'd like to take this opportunity to sing the praises of this TV and Amazon.com.A little background first, I previously owned a Westinghouse 42\" 1080P LCD TV (LVM42W2) that was plagued with vertical banding issues (sometimes referred to as uneven back-lighting) where vertical areas of the screen were slightly darker or lighter than the rest of the screen, and which were particularly visible during dark or gray scenes.  Even worse, after 2 years these bands eventually developed into even more visible dark streaks.  Eventually I had enough and started looking for a new TV.  Plasma burn-in still scares me so I stuck with LCD's.I bought the Samsung LN46A650 and when it arrived I immediately started feeding it dark scenes and looking for anything resembling vertical banding, and I am extremely happy to report that this TV has none.  It's been a week now and the more I watch this TV, the more satisfied I am with it.  The picture is great, even standard definition (SD) content looks very good (SD content was terrible on my old Westy).  XBox 360 games look great and run smooth as well.  The viewing angle is very good with a minimum of color wash-out even at extreme angles.A couple of notes, you'll want to go ahead and turn off Auto-Motion Plus (AMP).  It's kind of a gimmicky concept in the first place, but it really only succeeds and making things look strange.  And by strange, I mean movies start to look like live-action plays or like they were shot with a home-video camera.  I imagine some people will like this, but it's not for me, and I just turn it off.I've read other people griping about the remote, but to me that's so minor that it's almost not worth discussing.  It works well enough, and I use a universal remote anyway so it's non-issue.I've also read some comments on the reddish \"Touch of Color\", but it's very subtle, and really, hardly noticeable, and thus also a non-issue.The one legitimate complaint is this LCD's reflectiveness.  It is extremely glossy, and, depending on how you have your room situated (i.e. windows, lights, and lamps), it could take on a mirror-like appearance and be a major issue.  Fortunately, it's not an issue for me and my apartment.  But I could definitely see other people hating this TV for this issue alone.Now here's where I'm going to sing Amazon's praises.  A week after I bought this TV, I saw a forum posting where someone mentioned that Amazon was now offering a free Blu-ray player with a purchase of this TV.  I took a look and sure enough they were...so I sent Amazon an email asking if I could get that deal as well.  It seemed like a long shot because I had already bought the TV, and I was essentially asking them to give me a free Blu-ray player, but Amazon said they'd do it.  So I placed a second order for the Blu-ray player and they refunded my money.  So I couldn't be happier with my purchase.", "Date": "November 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "The best LCD for the price", "Author": "S.

Sure, some have this TV on sale for $1499.99, but add tax and shipping and you are paying close to $1700.00.  We went to many stores and compared size and picture quality and nothing was able to beat the price and picture on this baby.  HD through a cable box looks great.  I was a bit worried after seeing the poor quality of other Samsung LCD's in some family and friend's homes.  I worried for nothing.We were also worried about the glare we might experience as this TV sits opposite a huge window with an eastern exposure.  We had to move our previous TV due to the glare being so severe.  I am happy to report that with the curtains open, that the glare is not noticable on this TV.  Sure you can see it if you look for it, but it doesnt distract from the picture like our previous TV did.  With the shades drawn ( and the curtains are thin), you cant even see the glare.The speakers are a joke on this TV, I mean, I wouldnt even call these things speakers.  That said, I didnt drop the rating to 4 stars cause well, with this kind of picture, you have to have surround sound to even compare the two.  I dont think any MFG speaker could compete with that picture.We just bought a PS3 and connected it via HDMI.  WOW! We are big movie buffs and watching some of these movies on Blu Ray is like watching them again for the first time.  The picture is pristine!  I truly never thought I would be able to capture the same crystal clear picture I have seen in the store so many times, but I am happy to say I have.  This was well worth the money spent.

BestBuy, Costco, even Circuit city could not come close to the price Amazon offered. So for starters, you know that the price is a bargain and cant be beat. But what about the Tv itself and how does it compare to other brands and how does it compare to other models within Samsung?Well, during my research, my price budget was actually around 1200, and I was looking towards getting a toshiba of the same size 46\" that offered a gaming mode and it seemed to lure me in. But after comparing both TV's, toshiba just wasn't worth it. Yes of course samsung was more money, but you get what you paid for. And since this is an investment that you will enjoy over the years to come, you don't want to go cheap but you do want to have somewhat of a flexible budget. I spent 300-400 more in order to get the 46A650 which offered just simply much more. 50,000 contrast ratio, 120Hz, a beautiful viewing angle from literally any side of the room. Its just a fantastic tv. After going to circuit city, best buy to see the tv in person, I was convinced from the start that this is the tv I wanted. I just couldn't settle for anything less knowing there was so much to offer in the samsung ln46A650. the touch of red is pretty nice and it goes well with our carpetting as well as wall.After your convinced that samsung is the way to go, now you have to decide between the A650, A550, and A750.The 550 has a lower contrast ratio and the price difference was not much and the A750 was 300 dollars more, but you don't get much in return. If you check amazon, amazon lists the difference between the up/down graded models and you see the list of differences. Stick with A650 and you should be pleased with your choice.Now I didn't even consider Sony, it was just too much and I didn't like the looks of the TV itself. Seemed to bulky. The Samsung has a much more sleeker look and so even when people are over, they will notice the beauty of it whether the tv is on or off. And like I said..i love the touch of red...it is a nice touch.Now why did I get this tv? Two things: 1-PS3 (games and blue ray movies), and 2-Sports.This is where you really want a tv that can show itself in 120Hz. I only use it for sports and games. If you use it for movies, it looks way to real in the sense that its like they are making a movie and you are watching it outside your back door window. Almost gives you a 3d image that is just too awkward for me to watch and enjoy. So maybe if you don't play games or watch sports, then having a tv with 120Hz is not really that big of a deal (at least to me). You can probably settle for the A550 which I believe doesn't have 120Hz, only 60Hz.Anyhow I hope this helps, and you cant go wrong with Amazon's deals and free shipping.Don't worry, when they ship you your tv, they don't just leave it on your front porch, there is an exclusive shipping company that contacts you for a good day that they can come and deliver it and they will leave only with a signature.", "Date": "October 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Amazing tv with key upgrades over lower models", "Author": "D. Perkins", "ReviewID": "RMW69LKK3HETZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like most people on amazon, I researched tv's for months and months and i actually decided on the ln46a550 initially because it was more in my price range.  The price of the ln46a650 dropped significantly since then (and continues to do so) so i returned the other one and purchased this one.  I noticed a few key important upgrades.  First of all sound. Yes, i have a surround sound (a very expensive surround sound, almost as much as the tv) but certain things i listen through the tv speakers and i have to say on the 550 it was absolutely horrible and i couldn't do it.  This is not the case with the 650....believe it or not im actually listening to music on it and its very tolerable.  If you plan to never use these speakers (i didn't plan on it initially) then ignore that upgrade.  The next upgrade is on standard definition cable tv.  On the 550 SD cable looked pretty much horrible and surprisingly quite good on the 650.  If i wasn't familiar with HD components ( blu ray, HD DVD, HD cable....etc.) i would think it was High def cable.  simply put i have to complaints there and actually am not very inclined to get HD cable because it's almost not necessary.  The 120 hz AMP is interesting.  I definitely agree with other people that this feature can be good and bad.  If you walk into Circuit city, they will automatically tell you about it and make it seem like it is a \"must have\" but i would beg to differ.  Don't get me wrong, on certain things it is amazing but on regular movies....i could go without it sometimes.  Motion is very fluid and smooth.  For example, i watched alvin and the chipmunks with the demo 120 hz which means half the screem had it on and half off.  a girl jogged across the screen and on the off side it was choppy.  On the \"on\" side the motion was extremely smooth flowing and not choppy at all...BUT....as others have stated it makes everything look too smooth.  characters look almost computer generated by the way they move.  I have a ps3 and so all the movies i watch are blu ray ( which looks absolutely incredible on this tv) and i also play a lot of games.  this is where the 120 hz shines.  COD4 looks and feels awesome.  motion is fluid and because everything is computer generated to begin with....it just makes it all that much better.  You have the option of off, low, medium, and high, so you arent stuck with something...its all up to your discretion but im not totally sold on that technology yet. and just for the record....movies that are all CG take advantage of 120 hz because it acts just like ps3 games.  SO if you are stuck between this and the 550.....i would say it really all depends on how much you want to spend.  If you can go a little bit more than you would like, definitely go with the 650 but if you are on a tighter budget, i promise the 550 will blow you away too.  both are GREAT tv's and i would highly recommend both of them.  look at the bright side, this is pretty much a win win situation :)", "Date": "July 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Fantastic picture", "Author": "Matthew Krout", "ReviewID": "R2FT2W3Y6Q1BDB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I waited about a year or so until my eyes told me the LCD's were catching up in picture quality to the Plasma's.

One was a Sony and the other a Samsung. All the techs I spoke with gave these TV's excellent grades. Simply put, you could get the same excellent picture with this Samnsung model A650 as you would with a high end Sony .... but at a cheaper price. Although the picture quality is excellent, you first have to make some adjustments to see that. Pre set factory default settings can be made better by your own adjustments. This set also has the ability to control sound so it keeps the volume constant when those sometimes annoying commercials come on that raise you out of your seat. There are many great features with this TV that work even better when you compliment it with a matching DVD ( also bought a new Samsung VCR/DVD recorder combo). When the telenet option kicks in, you can use one remote (either TV or dvd) to control both sets. The remote that came with the TV is excellent with larger numbers to see. It also has a button that will light up the remote for use at night ... nice feature!I would have given this set 5 stars but I found some minor problems (this set might still deserve 5 stars and maybe I'm too critical). For one thing, picture quality is the sharpest as long as you do not sit any closer than 6 feet. Any closer and there seems to be some distortion. Farther away than 6 feet (up to 18 feet), the picture quality is outstanding. If you're use to watching your set real close than simply buy a 32inch instead. I also noticed that not all channels come in sharp, however I've found out this is not the fault of the set but of the broadcasting channel. The tv sound system is very good but they could have made the bass sound a little deeper and more powerful. You can make this even better by hooking up a theater sound system which results the viewing in a movie theater atmosphere. This set also has the 120mhgz picture speed (others only 60mghz) which catches any blur and smooths them out. I really didn't notice this much as a problem but those who watch a lot of sports (and watch the baseball fly through the air) might appreciate this TV option to stop any blur in movement. Side angle viewing is also excellent allowing up to 180 degree.One last thing ... don't confuse this model with all models of Samsung. Walmart and many other stores were pushing the model 500 or 550T over the Christmas holiday for about a $1000. Those sets do not have all the options, and plugs jacks that the model 650 has. Further, the picture quality and pixel speed are not as good or as fast as with the 650. Don't simply buy a brand and assume they all look and behave alike. Check them out by model numbers and read reviews and product options before making any choice. Sometimes by just spending a couple hundred dollars more will make a tremendous difference and make your viewing more enjoyable. I was also surprised to find a small note in the shipping box that alerted me to the fact my TV might have screen burn in problems if the same picture doesn't move for two hours. I had thought that LCD's didn't have this problem but apparently they do as the old tube sets. Not really a problem unless you use the set for video games and walk a away for a few hours without turning the set off.All in all, I found this set to be really remarkable.

I agree with all the positive reviews, so I don't need to repeat that information.  I also was amazed by the LACK of a reflection problem.  With my old non-flat screen, I had to turn all the lights off at night to avoid seeing them.  I was unexpectedly surprised NOT to see the same reflection issue with this TV.  I don't understand why, but it could be due to the fact that it is so amazingly bright and colorful and big, that light reflecting from table or ceiling light simply doesn't show up.  Whatever the explanation, this item does not have a relection problem compared to what I was expecting from couple negative reviews.  I did see some light reflection in reflectiveNote that as of September 1, 2008, Amazon no longer provides refund if the price of an item drops within 30 days.I was even more surprised when after searching for over the air channels (I don't have cable or satellite), I was rewarded with 54 stations.  I use one of those indoor RCA plug in type antennas which cost me I think about $50 at Sears a few years ago.  Now many of those 54 channels were repeats, but I was able to put ~15 HD channels into my favorites, and have the other lesser channels available if I need them.  Some have questioned why on earth one would buy such a nice HDTV and not pay for cable, but the compination of the 15 HD channels and the fantastic improvement in watching DVDs (including Blue-Ray) makes this purchase worth every penney.  Now I'm saving the $600-$1200 / year on cable/satellite, and invest that money in another TV for my basement or a nice vacation.  Alternatively, at an average savings of $1000/year, over the next 20 years given my investment strategies, I'll be ahead between $127,000-139,000.  With that I can see in person all those Monday night football games I'm missing by not having ESPN. :)Regarding movie watching, this 46'' is really big.  I'm amazed at what I was missing by watching movies (DVDs) with my 26'' regular TV.  Note that I struggled between buying the 46'' and the 52'', and am pleased with this 46'' because it fits better in the space I have.  It is also REALLY big, so don't feel bad about not spending extra money on larger version.  My couch is about 10-12' away.I also bought a PlayStation3 (PS3) at the same time in order to play Blue-Ray movies at 1060p.  It looks fantastic, but I must add that I could have waited, because the regular DVDs played with my Panasonic DMR-ES15 DVR also look fantastic on this TV...at least compared to what I was used to.  This TV is also incredible for playing PS3 games, and I'm also able to surf the internet with the PS3 (with separately purchased Logitech PS3 wireless keyboard) when my wife or kids are hogging the desktop computer and I don't want to fire up my laptop.Thus, if you are moving up from an old version TV, this Samsung HDTV will blow you away.

Every time my family and I went to a store to view the various TV options first hand, the picture on the Samsung LNa650 and LNa750 were just mind blowing and clearly sstandout from all the other tvs LCD or Plasma. So then the debate narrowed down to do we purchase the 650 or 750, since the price was so close and the subwoofer, speaker placement and DNLA compliance and slightly faster processing were nice additional features. In the end we opted to purchase the 650, as the reports and pictures of the \"halo\" effect from the 750's bezel frame when viewing the tv in the dark was of concern to us and would have certainly bothered us, although some people are not bothered by it at all.I am happy to say we have had this TV for 5 days now and are completely stunned and amazed at the picture quality. I am a jaded NYer and a hard person to impress, LOL, so that is saying a lot. The tv speaker sound is not as bad as some report in other reviews as long as you tweak the equalizer settings under the custom audio options and is absolutely acceptable once tweaked, at least when stand mounted like we hacve ours(speakers are in the rear of tv, and mounted on a wall, that could be the problem for some, idk?). That being said I have a SONY HT-CT100 Sound Bar hooked up via HDMI and it really looks sleek and sounds awesome as well (and was dirt cheap and very well reviewed by the pros and I would highly recommend it for it's sound and multi HDMI connectivity for the inexpensive price)so even though the sound is certainly acceptable from the tv alone, it's a non issue.I have had no shut off issues, tv shipped with upgraded firmware. The screen had not had any glare problems even though I have it in a room with a 30' ceiling and 4 huge windows on that massive wall, floor to ceiling. I have an ethernet cable hooked into the tv (will get the wireless dongle) and love the info link function which works flawlessly. The TOC which looks like a glass of cabernet makes the tv an absolute show piece in my family room and really, although it is so subtle, most people who have seen the tv do not notice the color, it just ads an oomph and sleekness that set this tv apart from the rest of the pack. The swivel base is very sturdy and doesn't feel flimsy. I have calibrated my tv. Although it looks great out of the box, it can look even better if you drill down past the standard presets, into the sub menus and the tv can be tweaked down to the smallest details.This tv does a good job upscaling SD TV, but it really takes your breath away if you have a HD cable/DVR box like we do. No offense, but to buy this tv and only take advantage of SD and not upgrade your cable box (or not eventually invest in Blu Ray and upscaled DVD) is nothing short of a complete waste, as you are not remotely taking advantage of the technology and could save your money and buy a lower resolution or non 120hz less expensive set. Blu Ray on this TV is just beyond description, and for movies, we love the 120hz motion and have not seen one blur or any judder, and have watched T3, Batman Begins and Day After Tomorrow and have not had the dreaded Soap Opera effect, just stunning visuals. That being said, watching any other tv in my house is now an utter disappointment. I am wasting plenty more time watching HDTV and movies as I still can't believe my eyes every time I turn the TV on it's =that= amazing. We laughed tonight that even the movie theater will be a disappointment compared to the clarity of our home system.For frame of reference, I at one time worked for Samsung's \"competition\" and know TVs and technology, and let me tell you this is nothing short of the \"real deal\". If you are one like me to not believe the hype...well in this case you can - and it is why it is a top seller. Looks even better at home than in the store. So glad after all the debates on plasma, branding, motion flow, and model we went with this tv. It's worth the investment for now and the future and it will not disappoint.

Since this is a significant investment, I didn't want to make a big mistake - or even a small one if I could help it. I've been reseraching, comparing, analyzing, and have viewed \"millions\" of TVs - or so it seems. Recently, after a lot of narrowing down of the choices, a lot of time was spent with side by side comparisions of the Samsung's closest competition (Sony's Bravia XBR). Picture quality on both are nothing short of amazing. Both have a high tech look, bright, sharp pictures, vibrant colors, and most importantly, very few if any pixel misfires, ghosts, etc.As far as I can tell, there is only one big difference between these two great TVs - Price. The Samsung is $600+ less than the Sony.Picture quality in HD is great. In SD, picture is fair to very good depending on the station. Apparently Samsung didn't waste their time with line doubling, pixel interporlation, or other methods to try to squeeze more information out of an SD signal (which will soon be history anyway). Be prepared to move up to digital cable, satellite, etc to get the best picture.Sound - well for me, it's fine. Sounds good, sufficiently loud for my average size living room. If you need or want anymore, you need a surround sound system anyway.Remote - Personally, I don't think its bad. Large buttons for those controls used most, volume, channel, and numerics. The scroll wheel everyone complains about is a little akward - so don't use it. Each of the 4 quadrants of the wheel has a switch so it can be used as a cursor. It's no problem to use at all. The automatic backlight feature for the buttons is nice.There are lots of ports on the back to plug in DVDs, etc. There are only two ports for plugging in composite video devices though, one on the back and one on the side. The USB \"WiseLink\" port on the side works well for displaying photographs or playing music from a USB memory stick. However, it doesn't seem to recognize video files stored on the stick.

The Runco was (and still is) a great TV, but over the past seven and a half years, it has been surpassed by other TVs in terms of resolution, input ports (my Runco has no HDMI or even DVI, which limits its usefulness with HD movies on disc), contrast ratio, and other important specifications. So, I decided to get a new TV to replace the still-operational Runco. After doing a lot of research, I decided on the Samsung LN46A650... a slight reduction in size from the Runco, but it fits in the same space without looking awkward.Put simply, this TV has a STUNNINGLY beautiful picture. The full 1920x1080, 1080p picture running at 120 Hz is amazingly smooth, both with HD movie discs (I have HD-DVD) and high-definition TV shows. Watching a movie or show now is almost like looking through a window. In fact, the first couple of days I had the new TV, I almost couldn't handle how good the picture was... it was so clear it was almost unreal. Now that I have gotten used to it, I really appreciate the 120 Hz feature.The Auto Motion Plus (AMP) feature is really cool, as well, but must be used sparingly. Sporting events really are enhanced by having 120 unique frames shown every second, rather than 24 or 30 frames spread out over each second. And video games also benefit from using AMP. But TV shows and movies really do take on a \"soap opera\" effect, making film look more like video. I've found that the AMP feature should be turned completely off for movies on disc, and lowered for TV shows.The InfoLink feature is great, albeit simple, and works very quickly when you connect the TV to your home network. And I especially like the wide variety of inputs on the back of the set. This set is futureproof. The physical appearance of the TV is also amazingly nice, although it took me a little time to adjust to the mirror-like reflective qualities of the screen. (I would love it if the Touch of Color feature came in other colors. The red is nice, but blue would be stunning and would fit my decor more closely.)My one gripe: The top of my TV was not level when I received it... the top of left side was about 1/8\" higher than the right side, and this was pretty noticeable since I have a painting hanging a few inches above the TV. There is NO WAY to adjust the level on this TV, so I had to put a thin shim underneath the right side of its stand to level out the top of the TV. Samsung needs to improve this in future models so that the stand can be properly aligned if it gets out of whack for any reason.Beyond that, though, I couldn't be more pleased with this TV. (Unless it came in a 50\" model. 52\" is too large for my space, but 50\" would have been perfect.)

Controlled light - when the blinds are partially closed - transforms the room and your mood.I must have visited Fry's, Best Buy and Circuit City a dozen times to look at and compare the glare in different models. I checked out the glare of every model on display with the TV on and off. I am sad to report that the Samsung LN650 series has a serious glare problem. Everything in front of the 650 series TV is clearly visible on the screen when the TV is off. When it is on, the reflections are still clearly visible except in really bright scenes. At home it will be more of an issue as you will not be cranking the brightness as high as the stores do to attract attention to sell the TV. It is a great TV otherwise. But what is the point in buying this TV if glare is your number one concern? I am surprised that people don't really care about glare and drop 1500 bucks on this TV.After I concluded my research I purchased the 47LG70 which has a matte screen. There is virtually no screen reflection and the picture is as good as the Samsung LN650 series - I compared them side by side at Fry's.

This TV is excellent! When looking at TV's I considered many different things.Type: LCD? Plasma? DLP?  LCD has come a long way. Even though blacks are a little richer in the plasma's I wanted to go with LCD as they look good enough to me. There are plenty of sites to give pros and cons of all 3 types.Size: 40\"? 46?\"  Thought about the 40\" but I know I would always say to myself \"I should have gotten the larger size\". I'm glad I got the 46\"...incredible.Hertz: 60hz or 120hz?  If you plan to watch any sports like NASCAR or Football, etc the 120hz will help provide a clearer picture while things move fast. This TV with the 120hz takes care of that and watching my NASCAR races looks great.Quick FYI comparing the 650 to 550, 750, 850:  550 has slower response times, lower contrast ratios, 60hz, less features, etc. With the constant dropping in price for the 650...these things were enough for me to not consider this TV for long.  750 has some memory built in, DLNA compalability for networking, pre-loaded content like recipes, a NON swiveling base, different outer bezel, a slightly better/faster chip (not enough to notice-same response time as the 650) and a subwoofer. Considering I have no intent to use my PC in anyway with my TV, have a surround sound system and don't need un-wanted recipes I did not care much to get this TV. I read too much about the Halo effect or slight reflection into the bezel which is unacceptable as far as I am concerned.  850 is pretty much the same as the 750...just much thinner and more expensive w/out bezel issue.Other things to note:1)The touch of red is nice. After looking at the TV for a while you don't even really notice it. But it adds a bit of class I think to the TV.2) GLARE IS NOT AN ISSUE. Like others have said, the picture is so vibrant it projects just fine and over powers any in coming light. Please don't let this be a deterrent from purchasing this. The 630 model has a matte finish but I just think the 650 looks better.3) InfoLink is nice. Quick reference for your local weather.4) Make the leap to HD if you haven't already. It looks great and makes all the difference. Regular broadcasts or decent but nothing compareed to HD. Blue Ray also looks incredible. Recommend both.I had a Sony 27\" Vega.

The contrast that this set offers both with its 50000:1 ratio and its screen technology is phenomenal (the 530 and lesser models do not provide the same \"pop\" because they lack 1 or both of these two factors).  Seen side by side in the stores there is no comparison in the blackness of the blacks this set delivers(at least in its/my price range).This brings me to my second point - value.  Purchased from Amazon (just before Thanksgiving)for $1500/no tax/free shipping/24 months interest free, this set is cheaper than the lesser but ever popular and well rated 550 model in stores and only $200 more than it online.  The $200 is well worth the increased contrast obtained from the 650, in my opinion.  No problems with the free CEVA shipping offered by Amazon.  They even allowed me to pick up the set at their local distribution office (ok, I was excited to get it).In addition, if that weren't a great enough value - I got a Samsung 1500 Blue Ray player for $198 with $200 instant rebate on Amazon when I purchased them together.  I've been smiling everytime I see these players for $199 in \"Doorbuster\" Christmas sales.  Incidentally, if you are new to the HD game like I was, please note that the difference in the quality of picture you achieve from HD programing vs. Blu-ray if astounding.  Do yourself a favor and invest in a Blu-ray player.  As one reviewer I came across in my research said, the picture on the 650 (especially using blu-ray) looks like you're looking out a window.  It's that good.My only other suggestion is to invest in (at least a cheap) Harmony remote, like the 550 ($50 on sale).

I was first contemplating on getting the 5 series (Ln52a550) larger screen @ 52\" at little bit more in price but lower in specs (i.e. lower contrast ratio and no 120hz). But I decided to go with a 46\" in more picture quality than the 52\". I am very pleased with my decision! Before I purchased the TV on Amazon, I went to my local Best Buy to look at the picture qualities and compare the various models. Right away, I can notice the deeper blacks and the more vibrant colors produced from this 6 series HDTV. The \"ultra clear panel\" glossy coat on the screen (similarly to what you see in plasmas) attribute to the more vibrant colors and deeper blacks, which in my opinion really deliver on a great picture. Please note, this might not be ideal for those who can't control the ambient lighting in the room because you might see a little glare. However, this is not a problem for me.One of my biggest dilemmas was this whole thing on the \"120hz\" auto motion, do I spend less and not worry about this feature or pay a little extra to have the latest technology out there in terms of LCD's? Well since I'm a gamer and I like watching sports, I opted to go withthe 120hz. At first, right out the box, the TV's settings have the 120hz on medium. The motion looked really awkward to me, sinceI'm not used to the 120hz motion flow (my previous TV being a 720p 32\" LCD mind you). The great thing I noticed when going through the picture options is that you can customize the settings to be off, low, medium, high, etc. So in other words, you can ease yourself in to the 120hz motion by starting off on low and turn it up when you feel you're ready for it. In my opinion, it looks great on the low setting.Other great features include: electrostatic touch sensitive controls on the TV bezel (adds to the sleek design), many picture adjustment options, ease of navigating menus, really nice remote with backlighting, great sound produced by the built-in down-firing speakers, ultra fast response time for gaming, info link to display RSS feeds such as weather and news (just connect it with a ethernet cable to your router / wireless option available), and swivel stand (for those of you that are not wall mounting this bad boy).One last thing that is important to note, Amazon's delivery service exceeded my expectations! When I purchased the TV I was quoted by the automated system on receiving the item in like 7 business days. I may have been lucky or Amazon is just good like this, but I actually got the TV in 3 business days!!! The delivery service called me the day before it was delivered to confirm a time to deliver the TV. Once the delivery got to my house, they called me to let me know they were here! The box was brought up to my house in a perfect condition box. If you're like me, even so the product may be good inside, but I hate boxes that look like they were beat up in transit.

At first, I was a little hesitant to drop my screen size 10 inches, and was even MORE hesitant about mounting such a large TV on my living room wall.After a few weeks of research including trips to various electronics stores, reading reviews on CNET, Consumer Reports, and others, I learned that Samsung is moving to the forefront of the LCD industry, and I can definitely see why. After purchasing the TV and getting it up on the wall, I can't believe I didn't do this sooner.The picture on the 650 model is amazing, even compared to my old DLP set (which had a pretty fantastic picture in its own right). To me, the most important facet of a TV's picture is the sharpness of an image (i.e. how rich and true its black levels are, and how crisp and defined images look). In this price range, I haven't seen another TV that even comes close to the image quality on the 650. High-definition programs in 1080i look amazing. Blu-ray movies and Playstation 3 games in 1080p will absolutely blow your mind.The 120Hz processing feature makes sports come to life. The \"blurred ball\" effect is virtually removed, and every replay seems to come to life because it's so smooth. In fact, the 120 Hz processing is SO effective, that I have to turn it off during movies and TV shows, because it makes the picture look TOO realistic, and can make pre-recorded film look like live live-action TV video.As far as mounting the TV, getting it connected and all that other stuff . . . . . piece of cake. Plenty of outputs (even I can't fill 4 HDMI). For true videophiles, there are a number of different options to fine-tune the picture quality. On-screen menus and the remote are a breeze to navigate.I was a little worried about the red accents along the outer edge of the TV, but in all honesty, you don't even notice them unless the TV is getting direct sunlight. At night, or with the blinds closed, you can barely even tell the red accent is there.I can't recommend this TV enough.

I spent over a year trying to decide which one to buy, and used the reviews of Amazon customers to make my decision. This TV is everything it is touted to be. It has a great picture, easy set-up, and I don't have any problems with the remote. The slight touch of red on the bezel actually compliments the sofa, but if you have something different, I don't think it would make a difference.  There are plenty of inputs for DVD, game stations, etc., and they are easy to reach. I only have 2 things to comment on regarding this purchase.  One is minor, but the 2nd is a great warning to others.The minor one.  I purchased a smaller Samsung earlier with the free \"White Glove Delivery\".  I received it a little late in the afternoon, but the delivery person was kind, and set it up, programmed it to make sure it would work properly, gave instructions, and removed the box.  This time, the person removed the TV from the box, and assisted boyfriend to put it up and plug it in.  However, he gave no assistance for programming, and told us we needed to keep the box for 30 days.  It is not a big deal, and since I didn't pay extra for delivery, I can't really complain.  They did deliver ahead of schedule, but if you have used this service before, it is dependent on the delivery person.  My 2nd thing is the most important thing for anyone who is purchasing a LCD TV and planning on changing from the stand to a mount.  Because of the configuration, we needed to remove the stand and attach the TV to an articulating wall mount.  (There is a fabulous one available on Amazon for only $154.90 - much less than everyone else)  After completing the construction needed, everything went well, until the mount needed to be attached to the TV.  MAKE SURE, WHEN YOU ATTACH A MOUNT TO THE TV, YOU LAY IT ON A SOFT SURFACE.  Boyfriend laid it on a clean glass coffee table, but it put a small (and I mean really small) nick in the screen, which has ruined the TV.  It is frustrating, of course not covered by warranty, and when we talked to the local repair people, they told us that we were looking at $1400.00 to fix it.  Simply not worth it.So, if you are looking for a fabulous 46\" LCD TV, I totally recommend this product.  I have grown to love Samsung products, and this one won't disappoint you.  Just don't make the same mistake I did, and have to buy it again.  Take care if you decide to change it from the stand to a mount - the screen is everything.

I'll list a few pros/cons so I don't ramble on for too long:PROs1)blue ray and up scaled dvd's are vibrant.2)gta iv and other ps3 games whether 1080 or 720 are beautiful and smooth3)lots of inputs. 4 HDMI! Also, convenient connectors on side for quick setup.4)turned off, the TV makes the room look sweet. The red isn't overwhelming in the least.5)lots of options in menu. good for a variety of viewing options/environments6)120 HZ is adjustable, necessary cause well... go to a store and see.7)Although pricey, it's cheaper than comparable TVsCONS1)The remote is terrible. It's as if an ipod had a slow cousin. Minor pain.2)Although I don't have issues with glare, it is possible to see how a house with lots of windows could be problematic.3)It can be hard to watch basic broadcasting cable (no HD Box... yet) but what HDTV would look amazing without a digital box?4)speakers aren't great (plan to get sound system)5)120 HZ sometimes can be too good. Change is difficult for some people.6)I can't stop watching movies/playing games; so pretty.No issues so far, but I haven't had it more than a month yet. Also, the TV was purchased at a store and not online, though it is cheaper on Amazon.My advice is to check it out at a store first. It is prefect for me but of course people have different opinions.

The black levels are great and the colors and clarity on HD material is stunning.  It even does an amazing job on upscaled DVD from my PS3, colors are especially good.  I also own another 37\" LCD which is very good especailly for computer use, but this thing runs circles around it in the picture quality arena, less particles, almost no digital artifacting, awesome contrast, vibrant colors etc.  You really have to see it to understand.  It is also the best LCD screen I have seen for component material.  I've always been dissappointed with LCDs in the past due to crushed blacks and muted colors via component, but this TV does a jaw dropping good job with component as well as HDMI. I've never seen my wii picture look so good.The 120hz refresh actually does help.  I did quite a few tests with it and it does help keep the screen smoother without any noticable sacrifice in quality.  The connection to the internet is handy if you are into news feeds, stocks, and weather.For those that have this TV, I found that putting it on movie mode and taking the back light down to 4 really helped make the picture even better from the default settings...allows the contrast improve markedly.  I found the picture at default is a bit cold and the contrast is too extreme due to over brightness leaving out quite a bit of detail in darker sceens and crushing the blacks.The only issue I have with it is that it sometimes has a scrambled image when I turn it on.  I'm pretty sure this is a freak, isolated issue with just my screen or a handful as I've never seen anything like it.  You can still see the picture, but the colors are all out of whack and there is horizontal banding throughout the image.I called up Samsung and they were great with their customer service and got me a service ticket immediately with a local fix it shop.  They came out the next day and took the TV, but they couldn't get it to replicate the issue in the 5 days they played with it--figures.  So they brought it back and of course it worked again just fine for about 5 days and then yesterday it started doing it again.  It isn't a permanent issue because I just turn it off and then when I turn it back on it takes about 10 seconds and then the picture pops back in with no problem, but the issue is annoying.

Yes the picture can appear 'grainy' depending on the source and the quality of the original HD picture but with the correct settings you can hardly notice.  Blu-ray planet earth even has a few spots where the picture quality wasn't as great as the other 96% of the show and if you nit pick you can see some pixelation.  The AMP 120hz setting, I found, really does help when a mountain peak is moving across the screen.  Use the 'demo' mode to see the difference when a large stationary object is moving across the screen.You need to calibrate the picture for the source you're using to get the 'great' picture.  There's a 1260+ post thread on the AVS forums dedicated to calibrating this set with different sources and firmware versions so I highly recommend spending some time there to learn more and get the picture set correctly.The order process via Amazon went great and I ended up getting it shipped from 6ave via Amazon.  6ave has refunded my card twice match Amazon's price drops so kudos to that company as well as Amazon and Samsung.The Sony universal remote has a code that perfectly matches this TV if you have gripes about the wheel on the remote.

This really sucks for my Wii, but I can just swap back to the AV cable.  I didn't knock off anything for this item, but I will on my mount review.

I would tell anyone looking to consider it.Update 2011Tv had worked great until around May 2011.  Then it started the dreaded \"clicking\" problem and wouldn't immediately power on.  Around August it wouldn't stay powered on after the clicking spells.  I went on Samsungs website for support, and it was out of warranty, no luck.  Read some reviews and saw this is a VERY common problem and that many folks were having their sets repaired free of charge by Samsung.  Well I decided to go to the online chat for support on their website, let them know that it was the same symptoms as the 1000s of capacitor complaints I've read online, but again I was told that my warranty was expired and I was out of luck.  I was very frustrated with the lack of support, but didn't give up.  10 minutes after the online chat runaround, I called their customer support and fibbed.  I told them I had a repairman look at my TV and he said it was a capacitor problem.  He said before before he charged me I should call Samsung b/c they were covering the repair charge.  The customer service rep confirmed that if my tv was within a range of models, they would do a one time replacement of the capacitors for free.  Sure enough, this model qualified, and in 2 weeks a service tech showed up at my door and was in and out in less than an hour.  Now my tv is working like new.  Frustrating that even though my product was registered and this is a VERY VERY common issue that I didn't get an email or something giving me steps.

I was price comparing for a Sony 46 inch XBR5 and thought that was the gold standard. One day, while shopping in Sears for clothes for my kids which always requires a detour to electronics just to comfirm my previous judgement of Sony's superiority in LCD televisions. As it happens, at this Sears they have a Samsung 71 series right next to XBR5 and I still thought the XBR was slightly better at color accuracy. My 2 Daughters 9 and 11 always picked the Sony as looking more realistic to them. After confirming what we already concluded. We walked to the end of the isle to look at LCD stands. That was the first time I saw the A650 and the first thing I thought was this is a Plasma. The glossy panel and deep black levels were striking and the color detail in this set edged past the XBR5. So my children now told me the A650 was now the best set in the store.By this time a sale person had come over and started her pitch and I probibly would have made a bad impulse purchase, except I didn't want to make payments on a TV. So I went home and found the A650 at Amazom $900.00 cheaper and $700.00 cheaper than the lowest XBR5 price from a reputable seller.I've have this set for 5 weeks now. Its connected to dish network through HDMI cables and 20 year old pioneer av receiver with HD dvd player. This lcd was a snap to set up, I think it took me 15 minutes. The HD dvd is the pinnacle of picture reproduction and this set blows my old Vizio away. I Am legend, Stardust, and Serenity looked awesome. When a broadcast is HD content, this set gets it almost as good as my HD dvd. When they are upconverting content to you, you can see the quality is not up to snuff. You can't blame the tv for that.

That's pretty prompt!The TVWhat can I say.  The picture is fantastic, the numerous picture options/controls allow a high level of control.  Maybe too much!  The sound is even good for stereo speakers on a TV.  Overall, after spending 18 months looking for the right TV and reading volumes of reviews, this TV takes the cake and gets a gold star.  The biggest drawback, the remote.  While everything you need is there, the wheel that you use to control the menu options - which is stylized after the iPod - does not work very well.  You either turn it too slow, and the option does not change, or too fast and you skip past the option you want.  I read the consumer reviews about this and was forewarned.  But, in the end it does not matter, I am using the Logitech 880 Universal Remote.The ToCThis has to be the dumbest marketing thing I have seen in a while.

The standard picture setting preset is near flawless when compared to calibration patterns and even standard def TV becomes tolerable when watching in the wide-fit picture mode.When using HDMI be sure to adjust the HDMI black level setting to avoid overly dark images but otherwise near perfect. The just-scan picture mode is great for high def sources like bluray, gaming or even HD broadcast; be sure to use game mode for gaming as this set introduces a lot of lag otherwise.The 120 frame auto-motion is fairly useless however and the TV looks its best when this feature is turned off. The one time it may have been useful, gaming, becomes a moot point since you can't have the auto motion on while in game mode. Bluray 1080p/24fps is awesome though and the 120 frames per second makes this possible so it is still worth it to have.The only real complaint I have is that the plastic bezel, the touch of color border around the edge of the screen, came with some factory defects in it; a noticeable dimple near the buttons and many many scratches that are clearly visible in some lighting situations. In direct sunlight the bezel also shows its transparency which can be distracting and make the TV look like a cheap plastic set.Overall though I don't have any regret in buying this set as it oozes quality from almost every aspect; little things like the blue filter and auto disabling of inputs that aren't powered on to make switching sources easier really give the impression that time was taken when designing the set. I just wish I could make it ignore the standard analog coax input because I will never, EVER use that. Period.

It makes it difficult to see what this TV is capable of.2- With Amazon price, delivery and service in general, stop shopping at your local electronics store as you're really wasting money. Amazon.com is the way to shop. I got this TV for $1619.99 and the price dropped to $1569.99 and amazon refunded my CC for the price difference. You have to know that Amazon.com policy has changed - as many other reviewers said - and they only guarantee the price you purchased for only a week later. Also, with the excellent service you get from CEVA, your purchase is taken care of and you can call them earlier to arrange and earlier delivery of your merchandise.3- I honestly thought the standard digital TV broadcasting will be ugly or blurry on this TV, but to the opposite. It was much better than my old TV and it was not disappointing at all. You definitely need an HD service to get the best of your TV.4- A lot of people gave this TV 4 stars of so because of the remote control or the glare and it really depends on how picky you're. I found the remote control to be tricky for few minutes but I got the hang of it quickly and did not find it difficult to operate though I may need to look at it to see what I should do. As far as the glare, I have had the TV for few days now and I have not seen what people are complaining about. If your window or light is behind you when you watch TV or you watch the TV from an angle, then definitely you will see light reflection. Adjust your light or watch the TV perpendicularly.7- The sound out-of-the-box for this TV is really good enough unless you have a movie theater or want your neighbors to call the police on you.6- As I mentioned above, with an HD service from your provider, you will enjoy watching anything on this TV. I got comcast HD receiver and I am connecting it to my TV via component cables (1080i signal) and I can't imagine watching this TV with SP3 or Blu ray.7- I am shooting for SP3 80GB as it is really an excellent choice for both blu-ray as well as a gaming system.

I called them on Tuesday when I saw their tracking showed my set was in Philadelphia which is their closest terminal to my house. They set me up for Wednesday delivery. Late Wednesday morning I called to confirm delivery and was told that someone must have made a mistake and that my set was in Columbus Ohio. They then offered to set me up for Friday delivery.Within the hour I got a call from the delivery agent and was told they had my set on their truck and were on their way to deliver it.(now I was really confused)I asked them to have their driver call me so I could arrange to meet him. The truck showed up and miraculously had my TV that CEVA thought was still in Ohio.It gets better.....Later that evening I got a call from another driver that said he was going to deliver my TV tomorrow and wanted directions to my house.Bottom line....keep an eye on the CEVA tracking system and call to set up and confirm your delivery. If they seem confused or give you questionable information make sure you question it or call again and ask someone else.

Unbelievable picture! For all you folks considering this product: Don't sweat the negative comments you've heard. There's and old saying that your glass is either half empty, or half full. With this TV, you simply have to decide which it is.I've seen a reviews where the following complaints were lodged:TOC bezel was loose. (not on mine)Remote too sensitive/slow/etc.(personal opinion, glass half empty)Screen too reflective. Matte finish would be better. (glass half empty)A couple of fellows at a BestBuy I stumbled into said a matte finish dimishes color clarity to a slight degree and glare could easily be reduced by drawing the curtains and tilting the unit down 2-3 degrees without noticable loss of clarity. I'll accept both claims.Unit shuts off by itself. (not on mine yet. If it does, I'll download the software patch from Samsung and be back on track)Inadequate speakers. (glass half empty. These speakers will play loud enough to annoy all the neighbors just like any other TV in the showroom.If sound is the critical issue, turn your home theater system on.)Basically, after reading dozens of tech. reviews, hundreds of comments from Amazon buyers, and sending dozens of big-box store associates running for cover when I walk through the door AGAIN to sniff and fondle every unit mounted to the wall, I took the plunge. I fear buyer's remorse more than I fear cancer, and I have no remorse over this decision. The only thing I would caution a potential buyer about is deciding between the 46 and 52 inch models. Once I placed mine, I realized I had room for the 52 inch unit. Damn! But that's ok. Seeing how the 46 in. model makes me behave like a deer caught in the headlights, it's safe to assume the 52 in. would have forced me to quit my job and resort to a feeding tube and catheter.You can find reasons to love or hate any TV you'll consider buying.

I've heard and read how much the LCDs have caught up the plasma in picture quality and I decided to give the top rated Samsung a chance.  I belong to a Audio/Visual forums and I downloaded the calibration settings from other Samsung owners that had their set professionally calibrated.The only advantages the Samsung had was 4 HDMI inputs, swivel base, and a larger screen by 4 inches, after that is was all Panasonic.  The +2 year old Panasonic had a sharper HD/SD picture quality, superior sound quality, faster start up, quicker HDMI channel changes, easier to calibrate and it required less tweaking depending on SD/HD signal.  After one week, I had to return the Samsung because it just wasn't worth spending that much money for decreased image/sound quality.  I replaced the Samsung with the Panasonic 58 inch 1080p TH-58PZ800U ($2,089 + $200 5 day ground shipping).Pros:- Very wide range of color adjustments- Very deep blacks- Excellent DVD and Blue-ray image with up-converted PS3 and Denon S-301 home theater.  This TV shines at 1080p!- Attractive design- Very lightCons:- Depending on signal, SD can be a little grainy and HD can be a little unclear (fuzzy edges, hazy eyes, blurry hair, softer overall look)- Glare/reflection because of smooth screen it was more of problems compared to my Panasonic Plasma.- Depending on the SD/HD channel, I had to constantly tweak the image quality because each HD/SD channel was different.  Could not set it and forget it like on the Panasonic.- Sound quality was difficult to adjust to a rich full sound, sounded like the speakers were too small for the unit.- The sound on the TV was delayed and produced an echo when using TV and home theater speakers. I had to turn off the TV speakers when using the surround sound system.- Limited viewing angle, colors start to degrade and wash out if you are more than 45 degrees either side.- Slight delay in switching channels with HDMI, had to change to component cables to speed up channel changing.- The 120 MHz motion setting produces an image quality similar to watching a soap opera.

Sweet \"Reviewer\"", "ReviewID": "R24NUEOTFRQO1E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV last weekend after researching several reviews on-line.  I spent hours [...]  going through different Tv's, but this one kept popping up as one I had wanted to buy. I had pretty much decided that no matter what the screen glare or the scroll wheel button they were referring to; to be a problem, this was my TV.  Cnet compared it to Samsung's 52\" and they said it was the most amazing picture they had ever seen.Once I turned this TV on, I realized what they meant.  The picture is Phenomenal right out of the box.  The black levels are very good and the colors are very brilliant.  I sit back 9.5 feet from the TV and was contemplating getting this one or the 40\"  I am glad I decided to go with the 46\"  It has a built in ethernet port or you can buy Samsung's wireless adapter to use the internet feature, something that was a selling point for me.  However, still to this day, I haven't really tried doing this because I have TIVO, which does all of that for me.I love that it has many HDMI slots, one for my TIVO, and one for my ROKU player to stream my Netflix movies.  I have already streamed several High Def HD movies through Netflix on this TV and it is amazing.We had to take it out of the box to get it to fit in my tiny Toyota Corolla and at that point, I did not see any dominant red with the \"Touch of Color\" with this TV.  Someone else described it perfect.  It is a very subtle, but deep red like a wine color you will not even notice unless there is a lot of light in the room.The TV does have a bit of a glare in a dark room, or when watching movies that are mostly dark in color.  I can see this being a problem for someone else who sits as close as myself to the TV and has friends over and they would need to view it at an angle instead of head on, especially if there is any sunlight in the room.  My house is mostly dark so I haven't experienced a huge issue with that.The remote leaves a little to be desired with it's wheel function, similar to an IPOD.  It does work, it just needs a steady hand.  Even if you aren't using the wheel function, you can still press the wheel down to the left, right, up, or down, which I find easier for me than trying to use the wheel.  It still \"skips\" sometimes and is something I am not fond about from this TV.  Looks like Samsung will continue using the wheel remote in the future according their website, even with 2009 models.I gave this TV a perfect five, because I watch TV for TV, not the remote.  The picture is outstanding, and the price was great. The HD channels are brilliant and the 120MHZ make standard channels look amazing too.This television has a built in Qualcomm tuner, so I was able to get more channels than I ever did when originally hooking it up directly to the cable line. That was a huge bonus.I'm very happy with my purchase.  Samsung won my vote.", "Date": "February 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "One of the best pictures ever!!!

Sony has nothing on Samsung in this price range. There is a reason why this is the best selling tv on amazon.com.Pros:- Very good color and contrast (If calibrated. See below for the calibration that I used)- Semi Gloss screen adds to color depth- Auto Motion Plus 120Hz gives an unbelievable clarity to \"live video\" recordings (i.e. sports, news, etc.)- This tv is awesome for gaming.Cons:- Semi gloss screen does reflect ambient light. So if you are easily annoyed by seeing a reflection of a lamp or window, then you might want to consider the LN46A630 model which does not have the glossy screen. In my opinion, the extra clarity that the glossy screen gives the picture is completely worth having some glare. You do get used to it after a day or two.- Auto Motion Plus 120Hz does not look good for DVD, Blu-ray, or any film source. The problem is that AMP 120Hz makes the picture look too good...you lose that \"film\" quality of movies. When turned on, especially on high, it seems as though you are watching something completely fake. The good news is that this feature can be turned to low/med/high or off. This is more of a disclaimer than a con for that reason.Now for the good stuff... The picture calibrations I am using is for a tv that is in a moderately bright room.

(My main setup is in my bedroom with the 52\" version of this same set).I only have 1 minor gripe: The remote. Samsung tried literally to reinvent the wheel and failed miserably. For me, this is a non issue, since my dinning room setup is controlled by the satellite box remote but in case you're going to actually use the TV's remote, you should know the remote's functionality with the little wheel is just broken. I didn't consider this small detail a setback important enough to remove any stars from the rating. Doing so would be like buying a 50 million G5 airplane and saying the plane is terrible because you didn't like the cupholders. If the remote happens to be just unbearable for you, any Samsung LCD remote from 3 years ago or newer will work just fine. Just order a replacement remote off ebay for about 20 bukcs and end of story.  For 20 bukcs more you made an almost perfect set, perfect. Done. It's fixable.Have in mind 99% of your hard earned money is going towards picture quality here. And only 1% is going towards the hideous remote. Opt for a different set with a better remote, and there won't be any 20 dollar accessory you can buy off ebay that will get you out of that hole. You will be stuck with sub par picture quality for good. The same goes to people who knock stars off the ratings of TV sets because they don't have good speakers.

Picture is just perfect and I love the very classy touch of color...so subtle and sometimes I wish the red showed more. No glare what so ever on the 6. I had a Philips LCD 720p previously and I cant even watch it now. Yes, the remote is annoying and it's wheel doesnt respond well but its not worth complaining about. The sound is poorly designed but who doesnt run a TV like this through a home theater system? Sound is still OK for regular TV watching but you need some type of speaker system to compliment this TV for movie watching. Ive grown to love the 120hz and even when it appears to project the \"soap opera\" effect on movies or TV. I watch Seinfeld everynight in HD and Cramer jumps into my living saying \"Hey Buddy\".

I live in California so just the savings in sales tax was more then enough to cover the cost of shipping.

Even when it's turned off it's a beautiful piece, the deep red glass surrounding the LCD screen is gorgeous.I have DirectTV upgraded to HD and the quality is simply amazing. All I needed to get going was an HDMI cable (given to me by Direct TV when they did my upgrade)and a power strip. I plugged the set in, turned it on and was mesmerized for the whole weekend.I also purchased a Samsung Blu-ray disc player which was a snap to install using another HDMI cable (purchased through Amazon) and with a compatible remote control everything works seamlessly together.A great product.

TV is unreal. I had the 550 for 2 weeks and decided to return it for the 650. WOW. There really is a huge difference- the 120hz & 4ms response combined with the AMP (auto-motion plus) make the picture sooooo much better. The AMP can be turned off/on or set to low/med/high. It's really great for sports and nature shows (like documentaries- Planet Earth, or Survivor), makes regular sitcoms, etc. seem kind of \"soap opera-like.\" It almost looks too real, scary. But if you don't like this effect (which I really do) its easily turned off. Please do yourself a favor and spend the extra few $$$ and go for the 650 over the 550, it's more than worth it and am so happy I made that decision. The glossy screen looks amazing and not sure why people complain about it. Only glare that comes is when the TV is off, and I don't watch it when it's off so who cares. Buy some blinds if glare is a problem. The Touch of Color red effect is barely noticeable, it seems more prevalent in the pictures on here than in actual life.

The delivery was ahead of schedule which was great, however I was dissapointed with the service during delivery.They called to schedule, gave me a time window, I was in the middle of something else so I said if at all possible please have the driver come towards the end of that time interval.  She said oh that's fine it may even be helpful to the driver. He didnt come later instead he came early. There was only one delivery guy, which meant I had to help him up the stairs to the second floor.  Additionaly, contrary to what most have said he advised me to keep the box for two weeks instead of taking the open box with him.  He just put the TV on, snowy picture and all and says ok it works please sign here. So I hooked everything up as he watched, made sure it worked then signed.He just wanted to get the heck outta there, which is fine, but free or not it was far from white glove delivery. I'm sure I'm one of the few, I'm just venting.2. TV - The Automotion Plus feature is great.  But as I think someone may have already mentioned, it takes some time to get used to if you're transitioning from an older HDTV.  I put Automotion on low and that seems to be a good medium.Overall it's a 5-star product but I was just really dissapointed with delivery.Update: 1-6-10...I've had this tv for almost a year and a half now and its been great and still is great.  No  issues to speak of.  The picture quality is awesome(esp. with blu ray).  There have been about three more people in my family to buy this tv after watching mine.

It is nearly impossible to describe the clarity and detail.What I really want to do is give a shout out to Amazon for its service.  I previously ordered this TV from Abes of Maine 3 months ago.  Over 3 weeks, I was delivered 2 sets that both had broken screens upon delivery.  I think that the FedEx driver might have been the main culprit in the damage because I witnessed their driver flipping the box end over end as he placed it in my garage (and this might have happened multiple times because I was never forewarned when they would deliver).  Nonetheless, Abe's contracted with FedEx (for which I paid more in shipping) to deliver the TVs and placed the sets in large unmarked boxes so it bears some responsibility, too.  Regardless, the amount of time and mental energy I spent in dealing with the deliveries, returns, and refund process is incalculable and I would never use Abe's again because of it.Amazon hired a local delivery company which called to set up a delivery time 3 days after I ordered the set and then had 2 men quickly and carefully bring the set to my office the next day.  If I had known how careful and professional the delivery would be, I would have had them deliver to my house, but I was feeling snake bitten after the Abe's/FedEx snafu and wanted to make sure that there was only 1 delivery attempt, not the multiple FedEx attempts which led to damaged screens.Love the TV.

My TV was delivered using CEVA.  Over the phone they gave a 4 hour time block (10am-2pm) and said the driver would call when he was 30 minutes away.  At 2:30pm I called, and found out he got slowed down at his last delivery.  He was at my apartment by 3:30pm.NOTE:  I was told to sign that he would not unpack it and when I questioned this he dodged the question.  Not a big deal, but 90% of the population probably cannot get the TV out of the box as I did by themselvesInputs>>>Comcast digital cable set top box (STB) connected with Belkin component cables.  I did this for two-fold.  1) My current box does not have HDMI out and I would rather not pay for it.  2)  Unless someone corrects me, I do not believe HDTV channels are 1080p, they are only 720p; therefore component is all that is needed.  **my audio reciever does not have HDMI**PS3 connected with Cables Unlimited HDMI (1.3) cable.  I used HDMI because PS3 games and Blu-Ray both can output at 1080p.  I send the video signal along the HDMI and audio to the Multi-AV with an old PS3 component Video and audio cable to my receiver.  My receiver is nothing special, but it unfortunately does not have an optical input, so I am left to use RCA cables.Note about Cables:  I used Belkin PureAV component video and Belkin PureAV RCA audio cables.  They can be found in the $8 to $15 range.  I have a Cables Unlimited HDMI cable that was around $10.  In hindsight I would have opted for something that Belkin made.  Do not waste your money on $80-100 Monster cables however.TV>>>The picture is wonderful, I played with the settings.  120Hz AutoMotion can make things look \"Soap Opera\"-ish.  I kept adjusting it while watching \"The Office\" TNT-HD last night.  When I was watching Sportscenter with lots of NFL highlighs I kept 120Hz AutoMotion running on High.  I also adjusted the NR (Noise Reduction) to High as well.  I was able to see noise in dark areas of the screen, but adjusting this eliminated this problem.  All system settings seemed good for PS3.  I played Tiger Woods 09 last night and it was very sharp.  I plan on watching \"Shooter\" BD tonight so I will see how deep black responds in a dark room.Comparison>>><<<The Westinghouse cannot match this.  The \"W\" is approximately 4 years old and LCD has come a long way.  If you are of the crowd, \"plasma is better than LCD\", \"Plasma is sharper\", etc. then you need to go to BB and do some comparing.<<<The Samsung plasma is similar.  If you recently purchased a plasma hold onto it.  Or move it to another room in the house and get a new LCD.  I am hoping to do side-by-side with my TV and the plasma to compare picture quality, contrast ratio, etc.  Plasma's are very hard to move becaue the front panel is glass and if it cracks your TV is done.  Not so with the LCD, it is not really different from the screen on your cell phone, Nintendo DS, old Gameboy, etc.I rate the Samsung LN46A650 at 93% or A-.  For the value I give it about a 97%.  It isn't cheap, but definitely not the most expensive.  I did look/shop around with Sony as well and I can say that the XBRs are a nicer unit.  But they are in the neighborhood of DOUBLE what I paid.  And for the ultimate TV, BB had the LN46A650 sitting next to a Pioneer Kuro for comparison.

For the high def channels carried by our cable company, the ones that have their act together and broadcast a good signal come out amazing on this tv. Having watched hd channels for a while now it really is true what others say, not all hd sources are created the same.The touch of color on this set is hardly noticeable. So if your worried about that feature clashing with your decor don't worry about it.We also have not seen the power down issues reported in other reviews. Must have been something isolated to earlier models. When we received the tv, there was a sticker on the box that made note of the tv having a firmware upgrade. So the power down issue was probably addressed by that.The remote is fine. As others have noted the scroll wheel on the remote doesn't react quickly so it can be a bit frustrating. But there are other keys on the remote that perform the same functions.Plus after buying the TV from Amazon the price dropped twice within 30 days of purchase. A quick call to Amazon Customer Service and I was refunded the difference. So it pays to keep an eye on the price after purchase, at least for 30 days while the price guarantee is in effect.All in all a good choice for your money!", "Date": "September 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Everything I wanted and delivered right on time!!!", "Author": "R.

Still, the standard cable feed isn't that bad. The 120Hz processor does well too and provided remarkable clarity when we watched Pirates of the Caribean 3 last week.

Benson", "ReviewID": "R30RJWHQUPBRJ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The LN-46A650 is a great HDTV.  CNET's review of the 52\" version applies across the board here.  HD images are vivid, clear and crisp with fantastic detail, and dark areas very rich and detailed.  And when I turn on the noise reduction, even our old VHS player looks decent!  No worries over the red \"touch of color\", it's hardly noticeable.  Even after hours of running, there's no sign of the shut-down problem reported by others.  The remote's a little funky, but once you learn it, it's fine.One thing to do right away: turn down the backlight, it ships very bright, and you'll get better images with a dimmer setting.  I went with CNET's dark-room settings, but AVS forums also have good suggestions.Biggest drawback: the deep blacks can combine with a somewhat reflective screen to reflect bright light sources behind the viewer.  It's no worse than our old CRT SDTV, but the flat-screen makes the reflection \"more perfect\" and hence more noticeable.  But it's only at night, with fluorescent lights glaring from a room behind the viewer, that it can be seen.  Dim or put out those lights (eg in daytime) or change the angle of the TV (swivel stand is included), and all's well.  And of course, it's only seen where the screen is very dark - so most of the time, reflections are not visible.The 120Hz?  Effective in very fast motion, and it can be tailored somewhat.  And frankly, the only time I can really see a difference is with very fast objects, as in tennis or baseball - otherwise, the fast 4ms refresh makes for fairly blur-free viewing even with 120Hz turned off.Delivery: I ordered it from Amazon with free shipping, and got it in about a week and a half, with outstanding service from shipper CEVA - the delivery guy called to arrange delivery time, unpacked it, set it up, even hooked up our cable and tested the set out, and was polite and professional.Price: After checking prices for months prior to purchase, I can say that Amazon's pricing beats anybody else that I would trust (and has a 30-day return policy).  After purchase, I checked the price regularly and used the 30-day price guarantee (1-800-201-7575, ext 7) to get another $200 off my purchase price.I'm very happy with my purchase and everyone who's seen it has been impressed.

I began looking at last years Samsung, the 71 Series. This is coming from a Die Hard Sony family, we have had Sony LCD's for years and no problems what so ever with them. I was set on getting the Sony 46\" XBR4 or 46\" XBR5, but after seeing the XBR4 in person I was not impressed,( I know that Best Buy just turns the TV's on and thats it) but regardless the XBR was being outperformed by the V series Sony. At this point I was very frustrated because every TV that I liked had a dead end. I then noticed this Samsung LN46A650, The clarity and sharpness of this LCD was literally astounding. Well it was only 3 weeks after this moment that I had the 46\" 6 Series in my room on my Floating Stand. While I am writing this review, Pirates of the Caribbean is playing (Blu Ray), and honestly the picture is Remarkable. I have taken so long to write this review because I keep watching the Super Sharp picture of the Samsung. Anyway, I wanted to buy it from Best Buy but they could not get close to Amazon's price, their lowest price was $2100 then $300 for a 4 year warranty, also $200 tax so $2600. Amazon's price was $2149 for the TV and the 5 year Warranty, NO TAX!!, FREE SHIPPING!!That Being Said, the Pros of the LN46A650,- Super Clear Panel. 120Hz, 50,000-1 Contrast Ratio. (HDMI with) Blu Ray, PS3, Xbox, HD channels or anything in Full HD will amaze even the Biggest Sony Fan (take my word for it).- 4 HDMI 1.3 ports, Digital Audio out, High Speed LCD, 4ms Response time.- TV is very light, easily mounts on stand or wall.- Touch of Color (ToC), is very subtle but adds style to any room.- Regular satellite looks good, use S-Video for Sat. instead of AV cables.- Also Amazon shipped it within a week, and also the price dropped and I recieved a refund for the difference in the price.The Cons of this TV,- Has a slight glare on the screen, but my window is directly across from the TV.- Thats it.Basically the TV is beyond clear, I have watched a 720p, and 1080p Sony for 3-4 years and my new Samsung blows it out of the water. If you are at all apprehensive about purchasing this TV online then don't be. 1080p looks astounding, and a very reasonable price for the Product.A++ to Samsung and Amazon, Thanks to Samsung for the Amazing TV and to Amazon for the remarkable price.I hope this helps someone who is on the fence of which TV to buy.

When it's off it looks modern, clean and classy.I have basic cable from Brighthouse and thought I would not get any HD channels. Wrong! I currently have about 15 HD channels that look terrific even though they are 750P and 1080i. Also many sub channels that I never had with an analog Sony TV.Currently only have a progressive 480p DVD player/burner but the picture is far better than it was with the Sony. I am looking to upgrade to an upconverting DVD player and eventually Blu-Ray but can't seem to justify the cost of the player and discs yet when the current picture is so nice.Wii games are great even though these too are not HD.My photos taken on my Nikon 10MP Digital Camera are awesome looking using the \"wiselink\" USB port. Haven't tried video through a memory card yet.Still trying to get used to the proper screen formats that are available.Depending on the channel widescreen degrades the picture changing it from the original 4:3 format. Sometimes there are \"letterbox\" bars on the top or on the sides. This is due to the different formats currently being broadcast from the different stations and in no way reflect on the TV itself. Still though you need to mess with it if you don't like what you see.Dynamic mode seems to give me the best overall picture although there are several settings to choose from including a custom setting.I also like the fact there is volume levelling virtually eliminating the often louder audio when a show breaks to commercial. You have to turn this feature on.The picture blows away my recent Visio 32\" TV that I purchased for the bedroom, but admittedly, that TV was $499 and still way ahead of any analog TV out there.Now I just need a HD DVR that I can buy and not rent from the Tivo,cable or sat folks.

The picture , when coupled with high quality sources is amazing and much better than most HD tv's I've seen. what I did not expect was it to do as well with a cheap DVD progressive scan/component video player that does not upscale. It looks hi def to me (for the most part) and I am a techie person. For the person that mentioned it only has one composite on the side, the first component video in the rear can double as composite (just read the manual). The remote is ok, not too bad . I really don't have too much negative to say other than the typical issues with HDTV's which is really just an issue with low res sources and the HDMI negotiation that occurs on a HD compatible cable box with multiple stations at multiple outputs. Things I have yet to try out-USB connections to play music/view images-Ethernet jack for the built in web connections-'adjusting' HDTV calibration other than with a few settings for 'cinema' mode black settings. The set does ask if you are setting it up for a store or home unit and it doesn't look to garish for the most part.-anylink setup for controlling other HDMI connections.One thing that made me really happy was getting the HD cable box since watching cable is what we normally do. What's really cool is watching sports or other 'live' HD events or any of the high resolution shows/channels , it will put a smile on your face with the quality.

Seriously, the color depth, the clarity, the contrast -- everything on this TV is pretty much, well, perfect. It is loaded with features, including this auto-smoothing effect that makes standard 24- or 30-fps content feel like its playing at 120fps, and it causes a really eerie, all-too-lifelike effect, like the TV isn't a TV, its a Window, and all the action is literally taking place in front of your face. I leave this feature turned off, its just too intense for me.I've never had a technical problem with the TV.

Rohde", "ReviewID": "R284TY8633GD11", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the LN46A650 in December 08 and it is my first flat panel television.  I currently have an aging Pioneer Elite RPTV in the den/home theater so this Samsung is for the kitchen/family room.Delivery: Overall delivery was very good and set up was ok, although the delivery man told my wife he could not connect it to our cable (Fios HD), only to an antenna.  Since I don't have an antenna he turned it on to static and was then satisfied it was working and left.Initial Impression: When I got home and connected it to the Fios box with HDMI my wife's first words were that it just looks so much more high def than our Pioneer HDTV and I agreed.Physical: I was initially very worried about the red touch of color, but it really is barely noticeable unless there is a back light or a lot of light in the room.  The TV is not too heavy and overall has a very attractive sleek look. It does collect dust on the bezel and stand especially, so dust often.Interface/Controls: The menu system looks very nice and there are an extensive set of controls, but the response could be faster.  The remote control has an innovative scroll wheel, but the response is too slow to make it practical. There are also some controls that would be very nice to have quick access to, such as the AMP function and backlight. Ideally you should be able to save different custom settings and then toggle between them such as for daytime, low light, or sports. You can switch between Dynamic, Standard and Movie, but since only Movie lets you get accurate calibration, it's not as useful as letting you save any custom settings as a preset. The TV is slow to start up and lock onto the HDMI signal - not really a big deal.Performance: I adjusted the TV using values published on CNET and other sites with some minor tweaking. I am versed on calibrating TVs although I do not have test equipment. From a straight on viewing angle the black level is very good and the contrast is outstanding.  The black level actually looks even better during the day when there is more light in the room - looking as dark as the bezel.  In low light the blacks are not as dark as they could be, but better than almost all other LCDs.  The colors are also very accurate and high definition signals really look amazing.  I believe that the type of screen helps with the contrast and black level, but it is reflective.  However, even in my heavily windowed great room in the day the reflections are not that noticeable when watching.Standard definition looks pretty good given the limitations of SD and the incoming signal. The AMP function does its job and I don't see any noticeable artifacts, but it does cause the soap opera effect, making things look like video instead of film.  I usually turn it off except for sports on occasion. One thing I noticed was some scrolling text is sometimes jerky, but that can be resolved using the Film mode setting of Auto 2.Negatives: The only real disappointment I have is with the viewing angle. The picture, while amazing from straight on, starts to degrade even 15-20 degrees off center. The black level rises and the contrast drops so the picture looks like there is a haze over it. I am very suprised about the many reviews here that say the viewing angle is outstanding and there is no loss in picture quality from the sides. While you can still see the picture from even very sharp angles the picture gets considerably washed out. Others who have posted otherwise must not be very critical in their viewing.Wish List: This is an outstanding TV.  There are only a couple requests I have to make it just about perfect:- Better viewing angle without loss of black and contrast- Light sensor to adjust the backlight based on the ambient room light- Ability to preset any configuration and easily switch between them- Direct buttons for adjusting backlight and AMP settings- Even better black levels- Less reflective screen- No touch of color - or the new gray one.", "Date": "May 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Samsung LN46A650", "Author": "Lawrence Martin", "ReviewID": "R3HNGEHYZP1ESS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Given an HD input source (i.e., HD cable or DVD/Blue-Ray) the monitor will produce very sharp pictures.

I spent months debating and researching which TV I wanted for my needs, and finally came to the decision on purchasing this unit.I was thinking about buying a TV from a major retail chain here locally since this is what I was used to over the years, and I have yet to make a considerable purchase from an online store. In the end though, seeing the price here on Amazon compared to the local stores, I just couldn't pass on the deal. Here it was nearly $1000 less then your Best Buy.Anyway, regarding the important stuff, the TV itself, I ordered the TV on a Monday night. I had scheduled the delivery date though the check out process to be nearly about a week and half away. I was disappointed as it showed this was the earliest time for delivery. Well 2 days after I ordered the TV online, I get a call from CEVA saying they would like to schedule a delivery for the next day. I was totally shocked that the TV was already in my city (Minneapolis, MN) that quick.Well the delivery guys came and I have to say their delivery was on time and prompt. They came right at the scheduled time, met me at the front door of my apartment complex, and even carried the TV in. After talking to them a little bit, they opened the box up and even plugged the unit in to test it. Once everything checked out, I signed the slip and they were on their way.After setting everything up (cable, DVD, Xbox...etc) I have to admit I was blown away with the picture quality. Standard channels look great which might be due to having a strong cable signal. HD content looks amazing. I simply cannot describe how great they look. I have the Planet Earth series on Bluray and never before have I seen such amazing detail. I can see blades of grass, whiskers on animals; dirt on their fur, cracks in rocks...etc. Amazing, indeed.The black levels are probably the best I have seen on any LCD TV. They compare in quality to plasma, and tubes. This set has very little bleed through, and the back lighting is perfect. I can't really notice any lights in the corners like most lower line LCD TV's. Colors are bright and vibrant without being lost in the blackness of some pictures. AMZING indeed.Gaming on the TV looks great. I am not taking full advantage of the 120hz for gaming since that feature is not supported though the VGA input. I currently have my Xbox hooked up that way in order for me to get 1080p since I have a pre-HDMI Xbox 360. Oh well I can live. The picture quality is amazing regardless, and completely blows my old LCD TV out of the water in that department.Since I mentioned the 120hz feature, I would like to say a few things about it myself. First of all I am glad the TV offers 4 different levels of 120hz conversion. Low, Med, High and off. At times, the 120hz can look a bit too fake, but other times it looks great. I think the best setting  for TV shows and movies and not having to lose that \"cinema feel\" is to have the 120hz set at Low to Medium. The High setting just looks too unnatural for my taste. In the end though, I like how the TV gives you the option to set it to suit your taste. I have read that some people here think the red frame was too much, and others who love it. In all honesty, I really can't even notice the dark red border as it blends in well with the TV, yet if you have any type of matching d\u00e9cor, it accents it well.Also, some people here have complained about the remote, and how awkward it may be. The remote itself really isn't that bad. I actually love it. It has a nice smooth flow to it that feels good and give it a nice wrap around feeling in your hands. It isn't rigid, square or heavy. The remote is very comfortable to say the least. It has the option to give backlighting as soon as it's picked up, and turns off when the remote is idle on the table for a few seconds. The remote itself isn't a multipurpose remote, but it does have the standard Play, Pause, Rewind...etc buttons. Maybe it's just me, but I haven't found out what those buttons are meant to do. I didn't really read the instruction book anyway. The scroll wheel on the remote is a little quirky and unresponsive at times, but you don't have to use it as a scroll only, it can be used as a direction pad as well. So if you want to scroll up or down, just push up on the wheel and it goes up, and so on for the other directions (Down, Left, Right...)The TV itself has a ton of inputs, HDMI's in the back and the side, S video, standard video, components, the works. It also has an optical audio out for those of us who have digital audio receivers. A great feature to have.Overall this is an amazing TV. I constantly get compliments from all my friends about how nice it looks in the living room, to how breathtaking the image is. It's simply so good that I just really don't know how to describe it. It's just something you really need to see for yourself.Con wise, I really can't think of anything bad with this TV. The TV itself does take a few seconds to boot up when you power it on. But with such complex electronics, its really should be expected. Also, when you power on, or off the TV, it makes a little music type chime which although cool and neat at first, it does get a little annoying over time. Thankfully there is an option in the menus to turn this off.The only real issue I have with the TV to be honest are the buttons on the TV. They are not really buttons so to speak, more like touch sensors. You don't have to push anything, just simply place your finger on what you want and it will sense your touch and activate. Sounds good, and it works in theory, but first the buttons are very hard to see in a naturally lighted room and are very hard to distinguish between each other. Many times I have hit the wrong buttons because it's just very hard to see. They are not back lighted which further compounds the problem. But this to me is a minor issue as usually I am not near the TV itself unless I am changing games, or putting in a DVD.Overall I am very pleased with this TV.

Hunter", "ReviewID": "R2U5H67YE9KP24", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, I ordered the TV on  Thursday morning and it was delivered the following afternoon.  The \"White Glove Delivery\" leaves a lot to be desired.  The delivery man was nice, but once we go the TV into the basement, he had me sign the delivery confirmation and he was on his way.  Fine with me because it saved me from tipping him and it was easy to hookup.  Thus far, that is the only complaint I have.I have very little natural light in my basement and have recess lighting so the glare issue has been a non issue as I figured it would be.  I think it is funny that previous reviewers have complained about the remote control.  It is fine, and easy to work with.  Also, the sound is better than I had been led to believe.  I will be hooking up surround sound when the stand arrives.Now to the good stuff.  I am an avid sports fan, so I watch a lot of sports and sportcenter.  This TV is for those who truly enjoy watching sports.  The combination of the 120 hz and 50,000:1 contrast ratio makes live action sports so crisp.  The refresher rate I believe is less than 4 ms which makes the movements seem fluent.  I was amazed watching the Big East basketball tournament this past weekend.  My wife caught me grinning as I was watching it on a few occasions.  The colors are extremely vivid and the black colors are so defined and sharp.  Gaming is unbelievable too.The factory settings are good.  I'm sure they could be adjusted better, but then I would be missing out on time spent enjoying the TV.  It's great because you can set the 120 Hz to low, medium, high or off.  Setting it to high with sports optimizes the smothness of motion. When you're watching your favorite shows on HD, you can set the 120Hz level to low or off and then you get more of a natural look.  When it is set on high it makes people seem very unatural, almost like a soap opera look to it.I have been researching LCD TV's for a couple of years and have always been partial to Samsung.  The only other brand I narrowed it down to was Sony's XBR.  However, with the 2009 models coming out now, the Samsung price was way better.

The tv arrived a day late but was also easy to set up.  Initially I was very upset about the day late delivery, but after getting the set and being amazed by the picture quality, I've gotten over it.  The picture is fantastic.  The \"touch of color\" is subtle and fits in nicely in our home.  I'm running the sound through a stereo system so tv speakers not an issue.I would highly recommend this tv.", "Date": "December 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Pleased owner", "Author": "Older Point-of-view \"Louise\"", "ReviewID": "R2CVLEEGDMT6E5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have had this TV for about one month.

All I have to say is this LCD looks great. I did a lot of research before purchasing this TV. I analyzed plasma vs lcd and also analyzed every feature and brand there was. It eventually came down to samsung and sony (lcd). After much consideration I decided to go with this Samsung! This TV does have a glossy finish to the screen and can still display some reflections. There is still less glare than on a plasma screen. The gloss does add some extra color depth and makes the blacks richer. Another reason I went with the LCD is power consumption and weight. Plasmas of this same size weigh close to 100lbs vs this LCD that comes in at about 49lbs. This comes in handy when trying to move the TV or mount it by yourself! The plasma will also run hotter and use a lot more energy. This model has the 120hz which the 550 model doesn't. If you want a good deal without the 120hz refresh rate, the 550 has gotten great reviews! Overall you can get a Samsung lcd that is just as good if not better than Sony but for a lot less money. I think Sony is still adding a surcharge because of their long standing reputation in the industry. And by the way the delivery service went great. CEVA delivered my LCD and were very helpful. I was going to be out of town on the estimated delivery date, so I contacted them and they were able to expedite the shipment to that Saturday (no charge)!

I've never bought a TV online before and I was very apprehensive but Amazon has so impressed me that I'll never feel that way again.  The TV was delivered promptly and with expert care.  The shipping company were amazing. Amazon offered the best value and price. Tax free and free shipping.  Now onto the TV.I researched TV's for over 6 months.  I also was contemplating upgrading to an HDTV for over 2 years.  Every review I read said that the Samsung LCD's offered the most features and the best picture quality for the price and then THIS TV came out.  The 650 Series.  A product model will come out once in a blue moon from a company that obviously was a labor of love and this is it.  It's nearly flawless (Actually its perfect to me. I can't find a flaw but i'm sure there is one somewhere)  and offers the best picture the best look and the most features compared to any competitor.  The overall package of the 650 series surpasses the 7 and 8 series.  This is the sweet spot of all the 2008 Samsung models.  Don't bother with the 5, 7 or 8 series.The color's are perfect and explode off the screen.  The Black Levels are Plasma quality.  You'd have to pay 2500 - 3000 Dollars to get a Plasma with better Blacks.  Think about that.  Yes Plasma's surpass LCD's on Black Levels but this TV Blows every Plasma away on Black Levels except the high end 2008 Plasmas.  So if you go to your friend's house who has a Plasma from a couple years ago, this TV will destroy it.  Within 5 years LCD's will overtake Plasma's completely.  The viewing angle quality is superb.  I stood on the side of the TV where NO ONE would ever attempt to watch TV and there was NO loss of quality in the picture.  The Touch of Red is beautiful.  I was very very unsure I'd like it.  When I first saw it online I thought it was neat that they took a bold approach to go with a radically different aesthetic then everyone else's TV's but I was afraid in my living room it would look garish or cheap.  My fears were gone when I saw the TV in person at Best Buy one day. In normal lighting (as it's meant to be seen in a room) the red  accents and blends into a deep burgundy and black on the frame.  Samsung knew what they were doing.  The Red would only stand out if you had spot lights shining on this TV.  Who is going to do that?  They really knew what they were doing.  The Red is gorgeous.I was a die hard Plasma fanatic and was dead set on getting a Panasonic until I saw this TV which in my opinion blows it away.Samsung has a long reputation for going above and beyond in the quality they deliver in a TV.  Believe me I know.  My last TV which I bought 8 years ago was a Samsung Flat Screen CRT with progressive scan native resolution and the ability to display 1080I resolution.  I bought it for 800 dollars.  Those features on a CRT at that price were unheard of 8 years ago.The last thing I expected to do was to come back to Samsung.  When I first started doing my research into HDTV's I figured it was a different playing field then CRT's.  I was wrong.  Samsung is just as committed to delivering the very best now as they were 8 years ago.  I didn't expect it. I wasn't looking for it but here I am and very happy about it.  Get this TV.  You'll never regret it.", "Date": "December 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very nice TV", "Author": "J. Thomas", "ReviewID": "R21ERIQFOEQYPL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After a few days of reading reviews and researching different TVs, I decided to purchase the Samsung LN46A650. Once I knew what I was looking for, I began pricing the item at different stores. Amazon's price was signifigantly lower than any of the local stores that I checked, and having ordered from them in the past, I knew I could expect good customer service from Amazon.  The TV arrived earlier than the date promised and the \"White Glove Delivery\" was also as promised.When the TV arrived, I did not yet have the HD service hooked up, I only had the basic Directv service.  I was not impressed with picture of the TV with the basic Directv service, which I expected would be the case prior to purchasing the TV. A few days later, I recieved HD service from Directv and the difference in the picture is amazing. The picture is very clear and what really strikes me is how people's skin looks, you can see every pore and line in thier face, it's very life like. The TV also provides excellent picture quality when viewing DVDs and Blurays.Prior to purchasing the TV, I was unsure of how the \"RED Touch Of Color\" would look. I would describe it as a thin red line around the outer edge of the TV's frame which fades into the black portion of the frame. I find it to be very subtle and I don't notice it much of the time, except at certain angles it seems to be more visible. My wife and I both like the \"RED Touch Of Color\".The TV is very user friendly and the remote control is very easy to use as well.  The number of input and output connections makes it very easy to connect all of my audio/video components. Also, I like the way the TV swivels on it's base so you can turn the TV to face you if you are sitting off center. I have my TV hooked up to external speakers, so I cannot vouche for the TV's speaker sound.I am very happy with the Samsung LN46A650 and I am once again happy with my purchase from Amazon.com. I would surely recommend both to a friend.

It was perfect for them to have it here just before thanksgiving. (The mount showed up a few hrs later from another vendor).  Anyway, right out of the box the picture was perfect, I didn't have to adjust anything.  Once you go through the setup process (very short) It was just a matter of putting it up on the wall.  The only way I can describe the picture is to say it looked like the old \"LIVE\" tv shows.  I had the movie \"African Queen\" on, and even though I was standing right next to the screen, I felt like I was standing on the boat itself.  It's been that way with almost every show I watch on it.  It has tons of inputs though I don't need that many in my bedroom but the features are way beyond my expectations. The \"Touch of Red\" is awesome, but you'll have to see it to believe it. I've heard many reviewers complain about the remote being cumbersome and hard to work.  I've had no such problems with mine.  It's a breeze to use and the \"backlight\" key is super when you're using it in the dark. The USB feature works great and it shows a great looking slideshow of pics if you have them on your flash drive, camera, etc. (flash drives that require a password will NOT work, so you might want to disable that on your flash drive)I can't be happier with my purchase.

I became a regular at the local Circuit City.  I know for a fact they got tired of me just looking and not purchasing from the store.  I had the LN46A650 next to the comparable Sony LCD HDTV 1080p 120mhz model.  In the dark lighting of the store the pictures were very close to the same.  It seemed to me that the Samsung had just a slight crisper image.  The only real difference I could tell was the price.I decided on the Samsung and I couldn't be more thrilled.  For a first time purchaser of HDTV I am still amazed by the quality and clearness of this picture.  The remote is a bit large but easy to use.  It only took me about 30 minutes to figure out how to use all the features of the TV.  You can control just about anything you want as far as color goes.  The same can be said about the contrast and or brightness.  I have basically left my TV at the factory settings with only minor tweaks.The sound is okay.  I plan to upgrade to a surround sound system to make the viewing experience even better.  I can live with the sound for now.Over all I am very happy with my purchase.  I would definitely recommend this TV.  For the price I could not find another unit that was even remotely close.

Like everyone else, I did my homework. There is not a TV with these specs that has a better value!2. I began looking last christmas for a TV and waited on the sidelines while the prices dropped. To those who are still waiting - prices will continue to fall, especially as new models are unveiled. After having this TV at home for a week, the last thing I am thinking about is how I could have saved another $100 or whatever. This TV is so amazing, I wish I had bought it sooner. I was going to buy it here but when I went to take one last look at it at my local electronics store, it was only $30 more so I just got it there. But I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon and love their service.3. This TV is begging for Blu Ray. DVD's on a normal player look terrible; the set is too good for it. Non HD cable channels also don't look too good, compared to the HD channels. The HD Cable TV is phenomenal, and it only broadcasts at 1080i compared to the Blu Ray's at 1080p. I knew there was a difference from cable TV to HD cable, and to 1080p but actually seeing it is such a huge difference.  I had not really considered a Blue Ray before, but I am going to buy one very soon. This TV is made for super high def. I just can't shake the feeling that this TV is not complete without the Blu Ray.4. The TOC is super subtle. I can barely see it. It is not 'lit up' as the marketing suggests. This is my first big screen and we are very happy with it. I was concerned that I got a broken TV because it was so subtle but I called Samsung and said it is not actually lit up. The frame is merely translucent and there is just a small amount of red material inside that you can see when a light source hits it.It is also very light to pick up.

I agree the Sonys are more expensive due to name brand.  The delivery service was excellent.  It was delivered earlier then due date.  It was delivered in time frame agreed and they borught into house, unpacked it, setup basic tv hookup and had me inspect it.  Could not ask for anything more and it was FREE!!.  I shopped for price and even with store discounts, Amazon was by far the cheapest and that is before tax free.  After going to the store this was the TV with the best picture for a LCD.  However after ready reviews, I had concerns about the glare, the red tint around frame.  I also considered the 750 but decide the glow around the edges would bother me and was not worth getting the memory in the TV, slight better tech. the base third speaker and the internet connect. I have had the TV for close to a month.  The picture is clear the colors are bright and it looks almost 3d.  The hook-ups were easy and numerous.  I switched to a HD cable box and went form component to HDMI.  Results were a better picture, but manu times the picture was not full screen.  Have to play with that.  I have two big picture windows in room and the glare was a problem until I rearranged the room to put the TV against the same wall as the window.  THe glare is not an issue anymore.  I also like the red tint around the frame.  It is not noticable unless you look for it.  It is deep in color and blends somewhat with the black of the frame.  I read in the manual if you want digital sound do not route you other devices through the TV but directly to the receiver.  Still playing with the speaker and wiring to get the best sound.  For a TV the sound from the speakers was more than exceptable.  I did not care about the PIP and have not tried it.  The remote is acceptable and has back lighting when in the dark.  I did not hang the TV so having the swivel stand (750 does not)a plus since many times during setup, It was nice to turn the TV to get to the hookups to add the next device or change the wiring. I feel for me I made the correct decision.  Good luck in your decisionand what you pick makes you as happy as I am with my decision.One last note, I also found a fantastic corner stand that fits in the corner nicely is 2 feet tall and is very sturdy.  It was over $300 but looks sharp with the TV.

Amazon kept me informed as to when the TV was shipped and on the expected delivery date.I have many read reviews from others re: this TV before I made the decision to purchase it. It is accurate that the shinny screen does reflect light when it is turned off like a mirror and also reflects lights from windows or lamps but to much lesser degree and I personally do not find this minor condition to be a problem when watching a program.  In fact, I rarely notice a reflection while watching the TV.In many reviews that I have read, there were many complaints re:  The Up/Down/Left/Right circular button on the remote. I admit that it took me a few tries to get the hang of it, but with in a few minutes I had no problem using it. I found this to be a minor negative.One other complaint I read Re: th Samsung 46A550 was that the sound was very poor. This is not the case on the 46A650. The sound is very satisfactory.I wasn't pleased with the delivery company (EGL)..The driver was NOT very careful bringing the TV into my house.  He was very rough in attemting to lift the unit over my 4\" step into my house, banging against it until I assisted him to raise it high enough.

I have the TV in my downstairs media room and it is directly next to a bay window at ground level and the reflection is noticeable but not too annoying or distracting if you ask me, however I can see why it may bother some people. But this picture is absolutely amazing.  The only thing that you may want to keep in mind is the 120 Hz True Motion on these high end LCD HDTVs. But there is no noticeable difference between the Sony and the Samsungs in my opinion. I watched them side by side and couldn't tell. But I wasn't quite sure how I felt about it at first, but I have grown to really like it. The way the camera moves and stuff makes it almost look unnatural, but you get used to it. I absolutely love to tell you the truth, but it does take some getting used to. After that it is like movies aren't even movies anymore, they are like watching something going on right outside your window......like you are watching live footage.

I was originally looking at the 750 series model, but there is very little difference for the approx. $200 price difference...an integrated sub-woofer which is marginal at best, and a mute point if you're patching the tv into your home system, and a gig of on-board cache for computer related stuff.The Samsungs had some of the best picture quality of all of the tv's on display. I would think there's a reason they have 35% of the LCD HDTV market share, but I also think the Sonys are very good as well, but priced higher.I noticed some have mentioned a glare issue with this tv, but this does not bother me at all. I've found that all tv's will have reflections, especially on bright days in the room where the tv sits. Even my old 35\" CRT tube tv gets some screen reflection. The Samsung clear panel technology is responsible for the more vivid colors and deeper blacks that a lot of other flat panels lack. This may contribute to it, but I think it's a good trade-off. It's really a matter of opinion, and I've found that the picture on these tv's are excellent regardless of room lighting conditions. One important thing...you may think that the picture is good right out of the box, but calibrating is crucial to getting the absolute best picture and extending the life of the tv. You can either pay to have your tv professionally calibrated, where they will plug expensive calibration equipment directly into your tv if you have the budget(some will come out and do it for anywhere from $150 to $300), or there are a couple of other options that are cheaper. You can buy a calibration dvd, and there are a couple of good ones out there, that takes you through the steps, or there are a couple of web sites where settings are posted for the various models. They won't be customized for your particular room, but are an excellent starting point......tweaktv.com being one of the better ones. If you go this route, you'll need to stay with the new settings for a few days to form an opinion since the factory settings are very high and bright, and something you get used to very quickly.I did my homework, so I knew what to expect, and I'm very happy with this tv.

Fortunately, I watch TV mostly at night. For watching during the day, the blackout shades on the larger two windows and brown fabric light-filtering shades on the other two (which are facing the TV) are eliminating the reflections almost completely. Without the shades lowered on the windows facing the TV, dark movies or scenes noticeably suffer from very distracting reflections on anything but the brightest material. Thus, light control should be a paramount concern for people planning to use the TV during the day in rooms with windows facing the screen.However, in a light-controlled room, this TV truly offers one of the best pictures I have ever seen. Superb detail and, with the unit calibrated (using the Digital Video Essentials HD Basics: Blu-ray DVD), an astounding color trueness and deep blacks (though obviously not quite on par with Pioneer's Kuro plasmas - if you want and can afford that, go with Samsung's 950 series or the Kuros). Conveniently, the inputs can be adjusted individually, so you can use the set's pretty exhaustive picture adjustments to optimize the settings for each input.I am pairing this unit with a Pioneer BDP-51FD blu-ray player and a Denon 2930CI upscaling player set to 1080p output, so your mileage may vary somewhat, especially when watching regular (non blu-ray) DVDs, depending on the player you use. However, the set appears to have surprisingly (given the price point) good video processing and correctly de-interlaces interlaced material, so unless your upscaling player is rather good, you may want to try having it put out 480i and let the TV do the scaling.The punchline: Superb picture IF ambient light can be controlled.", "Date": "September 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very Pleased", "Author": "Donald L.

I found myself drawn to the Sonys and the Samsungs that had 120hz.  It was interesting that sometimes I found the Sony's picture better, and sometimes I found the Samsung's better.  Considering the Samsung was 400 dollars less expensive, it was an easy choice.  I also had to make sure I could live with the Touch of Color red, which really isn't that bad.  Maybe if you're in a REALLY brightly lit room, it might get to you, but my room is pretty average lighting, not too dark or light, and the red doesn't bother me, it actually looks kind of nice.The screen is glossy, and yes, I'd rather it not.  However, without the gloss, the color might not be so good.  The color is fantastic, and it has the ability to burn your eyeballs if you so desire with the dynamic mode.  I actually calibrated my tv with one of those calibration discs, and in a nutshell, brightness got turned down, and gamma got turned up.  The picture looks fantastic for movies, however, if I need a brightness boost, like when I'm watching the game, there are 3 presets (game, movie, sports) that will do the trick with a simple push.The remote is backlit which is nice, and its a little sluggish, and not that appealing visually, however, like most, I too, will be purchasing a harmony universal remote, so whatever.  Too bad they don't have a 50 dollar discount on units to come without the remote!Switching sources is a bit sluggish, but I don't have another reference point, so I'm not sure if all LCD's are like that when switching between my cable to my blu-ray, or if its a thing with this set.Overall, picture is fantastic, touch of color isn't bad, tons of inputs.

Like others before me, I did my research. It came down to Sony and Samsung. Sony had a few more features, but the image on Samsung is head and shoulders above the comparable Sony: vibrant colors, sharp images, clean action (a good friend of mine has Sony's XBR3 unit and I like mine a lot better ;) I'm still learning how to optimize the image, but what I have now is so much better than anything before it. Well-worth the investment. Everone's comments here are spot on....Amazon was great. A week after I purchased and set up delivery, the price dropped and Amazon was courteous and responsive in providing the credit (I'd be interested in learning how the person who said he/she got it for ~$1500 did it...that's a great price!).Delivery, on the other hand, was less than satisfying. The organization, CEVA, delivered it earlier than stated (which was only inconvenient in that I had both the internet and DishNetwork folks in the house at the same time). However, if they were at my home for longer than 10 mins., I'd be surprised. The 2 men who came in barely spoke English. They were quietly curteous, but they stayed only long enough to turn the unit on, check for some sort of image (they even asked me if I had a DVD available to use, which I didn't, and then they left.

First I don't get barely any glare from the TV when I have the lights on in the room, Yes maybe a little more than if it had a Matte screen but not enough that it even makes the slightest difference compared to the benefit. The sound is another con by most people and I don't see why I have the TV at 25% volume in my apartment and I can hear it in the kitchen and throughout my apartment; at 50% volume my neighbors can hear it. If you want incredible sound buy a surrond system but for casual video guys like me in an apartment, the sound is great. Also the Remote isn't that bad and I think for the quality TV people are just picking at the smallest of details. I appreciate people doing this though so we know all of the details but over all there are no cons to keep anybody from buying the Samsung LN46A650.As a finishing touch the shipping worried me because of the reviews I read, but the service was 5 star. They called me and set an appointment within 4 days of me buying my TV and my wife was home to receive it and the guy showed her to setup and was very courteous.

I was able to track the whole shipment process on their website and they called me with a 4-hour delivery window as promised.  The driver could not have been more courteous, unpacked the set, hooked it up to make sure it worked OK and offered to haul off the boxes.  \"White-glove\" delivery is EXACTLY what I received!I've been watching the Samsung LN46A650 for a little over a week.  HD programming is exceptional.  I have satellite television, so the local network channels aren't in HD format yet; but, I can purchase an HD antenna if I want to view them in HD.  I'm not going to bore you with a lot technical stuff, if you're into it, you can do your own research.  I do know this television has a great picture, the best I've ever seen.  Would I buy this TV again?  YES I would!Now for the icing on the cake.  Seven days after it was delivered, I noticed the price had dropped $65 on Amazon, so I requested a refund through Amazon's Post-Order Price Guarantee.  No questions asked!  Within 24 hours, my refund had already been processed.I am a very pleased customer....Again!", "Date": "August 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Stunning", "Author": "BabyG \"Sam\"", "ReviewID": "RWF5V2XG3KYWL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first LCD TV.

They were really polite and when I asked them to call me ahead of time they said no problem.On Saturday, the delivery guy called me about an hour before he arrived. It was two guys, and then brought the package in, unpacked it for me, put the batteries in the remote and let me turn it on myself.

After reading a few of the reviews on various forums for different brands and models, I settled on the LN46A650 from Amazon. Amazon offered the best price. I was a little skeptical at first about the customer service involved with shipping such a large and expensive item, but for the most part it's been a pleasant experience.Unlike a lot of customers who already have HD sources, for now, I use the TV mainly for watching regular DVDs. I anticipate getting HD sources connected to the TV in the near future. Given that, the quality of standard DVD definition on the TV is nothing short of spectacular. Depending on what you're watching, a lot of the scenes can actually appear to look HD in quality. Of course, if you've been reading the reviews for this TV you already know of its rich feature set and superior black level. I agree wholeheartedly with those assessments.Likewise, you are probably aware of the somewhat reflective screen and that the touch of color (RED) isn't for everyone. For these two things, I'd recommend going to your local Best Buy or video store and checking the TV out for yourself to see if it agrees with your tastes. The remote control is probably the weakest link to this TV. It seems like more of an afterthought to an otherwise great TV. In my opinion, it's a hideous-looking remote that really isn't consistent with the quality and \"bling\" of the TV. The wheel can be difficult to use if you're not a patient person. Plus, it's not a universal remote, which came as a disappointment. Other than that, so far the TV is consistent with the positive reviews that are out there. You may have an issue with the firmware and software, but it's definitely not a deal breaker and is easily corrected.Now onto my shopping experience with Amazon. Like I mentioned, Amazon offered the best price/customer service balance. I'm certain you can find cheaper TVs on this model elsewhere but you may find yourself in a tussle with their customer service dept. should something go wrong. With my initial purchase, something did go wrong. I took my initial delivery a couple weeks ago and found the TV had a few defective pixels in the lower right corner. Of course, these things can occasionally happen on such a large LCD TV so I didn't cry about it....too much. After the discovery I simply called Amazon and explained to them the situation and they immediately set up an exchange for me. The call took less than 5 minutes and the rep. on the other line was very cordial. Two weeks later I took delivery of the new unit and so far the TV is performing perfectly. Of course, I'm still within the 30 days of my delivery so I plan to test the heck out the TV and update this review accordingly.As far as the main delivery company, CEVA, the company needs to train their phone handlers to be a little more courteous to their callers. The delivery was on time as should be expected but upon calling them to arrange specific delivery times I got the sense that they were either overworked or just didn't want to bother talking to anyone. In short, they were not very polite, even by today's standards.  Regardless of that, the delivery process itself was decent. Just don't expect the \"white glove\" label to be something spectacular because in my recent experience, it was just \"normal glove\".This is a solid performing TV and I'd recommend you give it some serious consideration to add to your entertainment arsenal.", "Date": "August 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best Television I've ever seen.", "Author": "Jeremy", "ReviewID": "R404PQYD8Y1PO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The best way to show you how good this tv is would be to completely list it's flaws.1) The rotary controller on the remote is a poor excuse for arrow buttons, and doesn't respond as it should.

After doing some \"extensive\" research I settled on the 46LNA550 over the 650 as the best value for money...yes the 550. I went to my local BB and brought that baby home. After 2 days, I found that Amazon had the 650 on sale for the same price of the 550. So I went to BB to take a look at it and was simply blown away by the picture. The 650 had a Blue ray hooked up to it and the picture was just fantastic. Also I really liked the Red TOC which look far more elegant and cool than the bland black frame of the 550. If you are spending so much on the TV i figured that it should have the looks too.So off went the 550, in came the 650 through Amazon. Eagle shipping was fast (my TV came in 4 days) sometimes for people living in smaller cities, they dont have service everyday, so make sure you are home at the scheduled time. I've been using the 650 for close to 3 weeks and till date I havent regretted my decision. The 650 is georgeous to look at (depends on the user). The pictures for Standard Definition are very good and crisp. I dont feel like adding the HD package when my SD looks this good. You do need to do some tweaking for the pic (available at avsforum.com) but it is till very good with the SD channels.As for the sound people have been complaining, I live in an apt and my living room is fairly large, I never had to turn up the volume more than 50% to listen to most of the channels. You need to turn it up a bit more if you have ur A/C running or in a noisy environment (when ppl around u are talking all the time). As for the glare/shiny surface, you will hardly notice it when you are watching TV. The only noticible effect is when its turned off and you can see significant reflection. But hey, if the TV is off, you aint watchin it either :)So overall, the 650 is the best bang for the buck. For those torn between the 550 and 650, if you dont mind the price difference, go with the 650, if its gonna make a dent in ur budget, the 550 is an equally good tv and will serve you well over the years. Compared to the 650, the 550 wasnt all that far behind. Now my next goal is to add a PS3 and harness the power of Blue Ray to see how the 650 handles it.Good luck.", "Date": "July 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "Samsung LN46A650", "Author": "Chris M.

I was right.This is the most amazing television I have ever seen.  The picture, the controls and the design are all top notch.  Samsung outdid themselves with this model.Even out of the box, the picture was amazing.  I didn't tinker with any settings for about a week and honestly was perfectly happy.  My DVD player and Wii looked fine, although regular cable looked awkward.  Then I made a few adjustments using some basic test patterns from an Avia DVD I bought several years ago and the picture is now absolutely beautiful.  I think the two biggest adjustments I made were to the sharpness (factory setting was waaaaay too high) and saturation (factory setting was too red).  Now movies played through my standard DVD player (no Blue-ray yet, that's next) look just about as good as they do on the big screen, and even regular cable looks fine (I think those who are complaining that it looks too \"real\" should try turning the sharpness way down).  I also just got hooked up to HD digital cable and the picture quality is unbelievable.  I really can't describe how good it is, so I'll stop.I like the remote.  It's not the prettiest remote I've seen, but I find it fairly intuitive.  Same with most of the basic menu options.The TV itself is very good looking.  I didn't think I'd like the touch of color, but it's grown on me.I was initially a little hesitant to make a purchase this large through Amazon, but money talks and I couldn't justify spending an extra $300-$400 plus shipping at a competitor.  So I had to wait an extra week or so for delivery, but that wasn't really a big deal.  It's summer and I should be outside anyway.  Their \"white glove\" service was great.  They came as scheduled and had me set up in less than 30 minutes.  No complaints with service.As others have mentioned, the only real downside with this set is that the picture in picture is a pain in the arse and is basically useless if you don't use a coax/antenna input.  My old Sony (which now sadly will not turn on) had a great split screen feature and I could play video games and watch TV/movies at the same time.  But that's the only thing I miss.Also, so far I'm not a fan of the AMP.  But that's not really an issue because it's easy to turn off.Overall this is one of the best TVs I've ever seen.

The HDMI hookups work perfectly though, no scrolling bars and no humming sounds. I highly suspect the culpret is Time Warner Cable (would not be surprising).

I also read about how people dislike the remote.  While it is true it is not well suited to control anything but the TV, it's fine for that, at least for me.The reason I wanted to add a review to the many more detailed ones available is to point out something I had not read in other reviews.  The incredible detail of the set, particularly with Blu-Ray, is something of a mixed blessing.  I didn't realize it until I owned the set, but the detail removes some of the magic of watching a movie.  The softness of the older display technologies added something to the other worldliness of movies.  In many interior scenes, seeing absolutely everything in such stark detail makes the fact they were shot on a set much more obvious.  To me, this detracts a bit from the overall movie experience by making the scenes more prosaic.  Outdoor shots don't suffer from this problem, but shots with lots of CGI effects suffer from it more.  I watched parts of the Two Towers portion of the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy last night, for instance, and the climactic battle scenes at Helm's Deep at the end of the movie lost some credibility, to my eye, because they show too much detail and thus seem less real, paradoxically.The preceding is obviously a very personal reaction to watching a fine HDTV set that can show such granular detail, but wanted to share since I haven't read any similar comments.", "Date": "December 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Pixel problems", "Author": "R.

I told her about the contrast differences and, mainly, the 120 motion.  Pointless, it was like speaking Japanese to an African.  My only concern was that the \"touch of color\" was going to screw up the entire appeal of the set.  So we headed on down to the now doomed Circuit City, where it was more than $500 above the price on Amazon (they wonder where their business goes), to get a glimpse firsthand what this thing looks like.  I was going mainly to see what the touch of color looked liked and I was pleasantly not distracted by it (I thought I would be).However, they had this set hooked up with RCA video, not even component and certainly not HDMI.  I asked the rep why the picture quality looked so weak and if the motion was turned on.  He said \"yes\", then I looked around back and saw the problem.  This is completely unfair to the television.  It's the equivalent of having a really nice sports car and driving around with the parking break on.  I couldn't believe it, the TV picture looked like garbage.I knew what this TV was capable of based on the hardware inside of it and the touch of color was not overbearing like I had hoped it wouldn't be. So based on other Amazonian's reviews, I convinced my wife that this TV would be very much worth it.I ordered it and five days later, the TV revolution started.  What an extreme difference a digital (HDMI) connection makes (compared to the CC setup).  There is a substantial difference in clarity and overall picture quality in this set versus my previous Aquos 1080p (hooked-up exactly with the same configuration (DirecTv HDMI).  People that come over that are technologically inclined are hailing this set as \"the best picture they've seen\".My two favorite points about the set would have to be the stunning black levels and the surreal 120 motion.  It looks better than I expected.  So I learned what I already knew, 1080p is not altogether even on the same spectrum to the new 1080p sets.  These new sets have much less fragments floating around, much clearer, richer color, and the motion..... you'll see.Thanks for all your reviews, it truly was the deciding factor in taking the leap.

We researched hdtv's for a long time and we knew that Samsung made the very best! Now I am somewhat tech-savvy but really I think anyone can tell that Samsung is the best. If you don't believe me, go to your nearest Best B** or other electronics retailer. Look at the TV's on the walls and then look to see which screen seems closer to black and which colors look more true to life? The answer will be Samsung every time!Now for someone who isn't all that tech savvy but wants to buy a great tv here's what to look for:Contrast Ratio- This is what makes the screen seem look black. If you go to your local WalM*** or such place you will see that they have very cheap hdtv's... Even those these tv's are hdtv's, they mostly junk! Yes, I am aware that you can buy Samsungs there, but look at the specs. The contrast ratio may only be 2000:1.1080p- This is going to give you a much better picture than a 740p. When we visited a friends house they had just bought an hdtv, but the screen was horribly \"pixelated\". It was awful! You will not get this with the Samsung. The picture is clear and so life-like its amazing!120hz- The 120hz really does make a difference in fast squences. Other hdtv's tend to get blurry when there is some fast action... but not this Samsung! We have never had an issue with the screen being blurry.I also really love the design and color of this particular tv. It's very modern and the red is a great little touch.Not long after purchasing the tv, we had family over and were watching a movie. Our relatives (who own an hdtv) thought the movie was blu-ray because of how amazing the image quality was... They couldn't believe it was just the normal dvd!You cannot beat the quality of Samsung tvs! Plus the price on Amazon will beat anyone else, and the shipping was great. It was fast, the people were very courteous and they even hooked everything up.As far as the size of the tv, our couch is fairly far away from the tv and the 46 inch is the perfect size!I can't say enough great things about this tv. HOWEVER, the only thing I will say is that if you are considering spending this much on a TV you may want to consider going with one of Samsungs new LED tv's. On Amazon they really aren't too much more and they are even more amazing!! We're considering buying one and putting this 46in one in our bedroom!But if you don't want to spend more then you should defintely buy this tv.

So needless to say it took some time to get use to the picture size.One thing that many have not comment on is that the TV produces a 3D like effect where the people in the foreground do stand out from the background. Some people complain about this but I think it makes the scene very realistic and gives you the feeling you are there. All friends and family agree with me. . . If you still fell its an issue after a while your eyes get use to it and it is not noticeable.At the time this is one of the top of the line models, and even though LED is coming out driving the price down of all LCD models I purchased this TV because I knew it had longevity. Why well its 1080p, 120Hz, a high contrast ratio, and the Samsungs I have purchased have lasted me over 13 years! I believe the TV now cost 1300 dollars which I believe is still worth the value. I got it at 1500.Of course you need to have HD channels to really see the worth of the TV, but it does a fairly good job on none HD channels. I have a PS3 and playing COD or watching a blue ray (even non-blue ray) looks amazing on the TV. Granted you need an HDMI cable and PS3 enhances regular DVDs. Many are blown away by the detail it shows.So what are some of the downsides we can't always be biased. The TV runs hot. . . it needs to have a spacious room so the heat will not overwhelm a room. I usually keep a fan on when I turn on my TV just so my room stays cool. Also when you turn it off it always makes a sound to notify you that it is turning off. I personally could have done away with that. Tried to find the option to mute it but didnt find one.Misc. tid bit.The TV turns on relatively quick within 5 seconds. My family has a Sony Bravia and that takes forever (15 seconds) to turn on.

My fear had always been to be see if any of these praised models would give me motion response accuracy, vividness in color and brightness/contrast that would satisfy my norms in accordance w/ current 1080p technology.  The Sonys (beautiful housing and nice remote) do not fill me w/ satisfaction regarding stark contrast and motionResponse. The A630 is better (not much) in contrast, (a tad more) responsive to motion yet does not have the loveliness in color softness & hue. The A650 is a nice piece of glossy furniture w/ everything the A630 has, but comes w/ a more pronounced contrast and a slightly better accuracy in fast motion. The glare from the 46A650 screen is by far a non-issue when the adjacent rooms only show mere inside lighting (not direct sunlight)and when most windows are curtained. I don't think the matte A630 surpasses the glossy A650, but both deserve a serious consideration when bright 120HZ LCD is on your current prospect list, and when Viera/plasma is yet to beat LCD HDTV in brightness. I don't give weight to remote control, sound or internet capability since I only focus on image quality and response to motion.

While I have no real complaints, I felt I couldn't honestly give out 5 stars as I'm a bit of a neophyte, and my 5-star rating wouldn't mean all that much.  My gut impression of the TV overall is that it's a great TV so I wanted my rating to reflect that.I thought the Red TOC would distract me, but it's very subtle and I don't notice it at all anymore, and it has actually grown on me.  The TV itself looks very classy.Many people comment on how they dislike the remote for this TV. I actually like this remote. I don't really have problems with the click wheel. I feel the shape is ergonomic (for my hand anyway since I have really small hands) and the buttons are well-placed relative to their function.As for the picture. No complaints, but I'm no expert and have nothing to compare it to since this is my first HDTV as I mentioned. All I can say is that I went to Best Buy and tried to do a blind comparison of all the TVs. This Best Buy has ALL their HDTVs against a large back wall and I walked through and looked at just the picture on the screens without noting the brand. The Samsungs popped out at me every time.  That's why I went with one. The colors are rich and vibrant. Even with my large living room window open, the colors still pop. Sometimes I'll work on my computer which is located off to the side of the TV and I can still see the picture perfectly from that viewing angle.  We're talking about 15 degrees from horizontal at most.I don't really care for the Automotion Plus 120 Hz function. I generally turn it off. Somehow when I turn it on the picture looks less \"real\" to me. I don't know how else to describe it.  I don't think it matters much unless you're watching something with lots of CGI or when you're gaming. I don't really do either.One annoying thing another reviewer mentioned is that it does take several seconds to turn on.  I find myself instinctively hitting the power button again when I get impatient and end up turning the TV off accidentally. It also takes a beat for the TV to turn off.

Both sets are full HD with 120HZ.  I am especially impressed with the Samsung non-HD picture.  It is spectacular!One small yet impressive detail to note, especially if you have this TV in your bedroom, is it has a backlight remote.  This is especially helpful when you are watching TV in the dark (when your spouse is sleeping).  You can turn the backlight on and it will automatically turn off after you put it down after about 30 seconds.  MORE IMPRESSIVE is that it has some type of motion detector on it.  When you pick the remote back up it automatically lights up!  Awesome.Note:  The contrast setting out of the box is set to 95%.  WAY TOO HIGH for my taste.

It had been 10 years since I had bought a tv. And I have to admit I felt overwhelmed by everything it takes to choose a tv now days. The place to begin is taking a look at what's out there and determining your personal tastes. I had bought a 22 inch Samsung a year ago for my daughter's college room and feel in love with its picture. Though that was a consideration, I did compare Sonys, Panasonics, LGs, Sharps, the gamut.I knew my viewing room needed a 46 inch LCD set to fill its visual space. From there I started visiting big box stores, comparing picture quality and features. After reading all the articles, reviews, product descriptions and talking it over with some friends, I have to admit I don't believe anyone produces a better LCD set than Samsung. Sonys have a great name and history. But in picture quality, resolution, features, value, Samsung wins hands down. At least, as far as I am concerned.My biggest frustration was delivery day. Being a hands on kind of guy I research a ton and then I am willing to try things myself. I've been around things electronic and mechanical all my life and knew I could set up and calibrate the set myself, which I did. Only thing I wish Samsung did was produce a clearer explanation of settings in their set up guides. Both the quick guide and tv manual were thin on settings between cable boxes, receivers, and the tv. After a little experimentation I got the picture up and its been smooth sailing from there. Being the suspicious kind, I think this is why people spend tons of money having other people set up for them, and the manufacturers are complicit in this. Getting past that, I love the set. It's a wonderful addition and I would highly recommend expending the few extra dollars to buy the Samsung a650.

I juggle between the high and medium setting on AMP, depending on the mood I'm in.When I knew I had to have the AMP feature, I then compared the picture quality of different sets and the LN46A650 won every time. The colors are noticeably richer thany any other TV I looked at. I was originally going to get a Sony, but after further research, I realized this was the superior TV. I couldn't possibly be any happier.Also, I ordered this set through Amazon Warehouse Deals as \"Used-Like New.\" I admit I was a little hesitant at first, but the price tag of $1350 total (including shipping and handling, and thankfully no tax) was too irresistable. If this TV has been used, I sure as heck cannot tell at all. It's literally in PERFECT condition. If you can get a \"Used-Like New\" set through Amazon Warehouse Deals, go for it!

I'm sure you can calibrate it to where the picture is even better, but I'm speechless with the factory settings.Most negative comments have to do with the speakers and remote. The sound from the speakers really isn't too bad for everyday shows. But I also have a home theater system hooked up to it for sports and movies on tv. The wheel scroll on the remote is pretty interesting and can be a pain sometimes.

I actually downgraded from a 60\" mitsubishi 1080p DLP tv, and was kind of worried that the smaller size might be an issue. I was wrong, the colors are so vibrant, and the detail so amazing, that i didnt even notice the smaller size. The deep red bezel and touch controls on the tv are also really cool. I cant really speak to the extra connections or anything, as i have all of my connections through a yamaha surround receiver so im only using a single hdmi input. It takes maybe 2-3 seconds for the tv to show the picture after turning on, or switching signals (xbox, ps3, dvr, computer). The only real downside ive noticed so far is that it doesnt automatically fill the screen with the picture as my mitsubishi did. (ie, get rid of the black boxes either on top/bottom, or sides). granted im still learning alot about the tv, and the manual is huge, so there may be a way to get it to work, but i havent found it yet after going through all of the regular menus. I also cant speak to the speakers on the tv as again, i use a surround sound receiver.Overall this tv is utterly amazing in the clarity, vibrance, and details that the picture shows. The 120Hz took a bit of getting used to at first. Its kind of strange how it makes every tv show almost look like a soap opera in the way those are filmed. Its hard to describe, but the motion of people in particular look like they are filmed live or something. Again, took some getting used to, and didnt really like it at first, but its definitely grown on me. And there is a menu to adjust the level of the 120Hz (off, low, medium, high). Mines currently set on medium. Also, as a previous review said, the lower quality channels do show lots of pixelation and such, but the high def channels are amazing. The tv is also very bright (lights up my whole living room).

Running via HDMI (ATI HD4850).  Can get sound on the TV through HDMI.  There's a special PC mode you can use, but this setting limits some of the picture control options.  I run it just as a normal HDMI component and can calibrate the TV to have a really nice picture for Video.  You'll want to make sure you're graphics card can output to 1920x1080 and you're set.  PC mode looks better for regular desktop computing, though.  You can use one of the two customizable picture settings for desktop and one for video to get a pretty good compromise.Interestingly enough, I like AMP for a lot of the PC stuff.  It can help smooth out choppy videos, tickers, web banners, Anime, everything.  Also NASCAR just looks unbelievable, it's like you're there (and I've been to a lot of NASCAR races).Everything high def I throw at it looks stunning.  The TV has really dark blacks and rich color.  You can brighten up the picture to make it more vibrant and keep the darks dark with some of the advanced picture controls.A word about the clouding and flashlighting, it does have some, at least on my set.  It's not bad enough for me to go through the whole process of returning the set but it is noticeable, mainly in scenes where a large portion of the screen is black (24).  The real tragedy is that it doesn't really show up until you bump down the brightness a bit and get it calibrated.  It can be tamed somewhat by turning down the backlight (I like it on 5, 3 is too dark to me), by turning on the power saving to auto (results in some screen darkening during dark scenes but not too bad) and also by using the dynamic contrast (same as power saving but to a lesser extent).  You can almost dial it out but we really should be trying to dial in the picture, not dial out a flaw in the set (hence, 4 stars).", "Date": "March 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Fantastic!", "Author": "Camo335 \"Cameron\"", "ReviewID": "R1DM3PBDQUJ0VW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I LOVE this TV.

Based on high def sources the TV produces incredible brilliant scenes, the best that I have seen.  My problem is that you have to manually choose screen size, recommendation is to use 16:9 as much as possible.  Problem comes with SD broadcasts even received digitally though a cable company.  If you select Wide View to expand the picture, it cuts off the bottom and top of the image.  This is especially annoying watching ESPN, CNN, CNBC and other channels that use the bottom part of the screen to show scores of other games, time left in the game, news scrolling at bottom, stock transcactions scrolling at bottom, etc.  The manual says to move the image up so you can see the scrolling items.  Great except now the heads of people on the screen are cut off.  Could not find a good resolution to this problem.  Sony Bravia on the other hand has a Auto Wide feature which checks the source signal and then fills the screen.  Yes it does change the aspect ratio to fit a 4:3 to a 16:9, so their faces are a little wider but you see everything being broadcast on the screen.  Prefer Sony's way of dealing with SD channels over Samsung so I am returning the Samsung for a Sony 46 V Bravia TV.", "Date": "March 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "beautiful", "Author": "J.

I recently bought a couple of cheap 19\" LCD TVs for my kids and had a chance to see how much the technology has improved.  After looking at some of the larger TVs in local stores, I decided it was time to upgrade from my 28\" CRT.Since I wasn't very familiar with newer types of TVs I did some research.  There are several pros and cons to be considered in deciding between LCD and Plasma, but I eventually went with LCD on a recommendation from a friend.Next it was time to decide what TV seemed the best to me.  My intention was to get a higher end TV that I wouldn't want to replace for a very long time.  Looking over my living room I decided a 46\" TV would work best for me (though many sites I looked at assured me that a 52\" wouldn't be too big).  I'm viewing the screen from about 12 feet away an I'm happy with the size of this TV.  I think I would have been ok with a 52\" also, but I'm certainly not disappointed by the 46\" size of this TV.Next I had to decide what features were most important to me.  Features vary a lot from brand to brand, but I settled in on Samsung as the brand with the features I liked the best.  One of the most wonderful things about this TV is the 50000:1 contrast ratio.  I've never seen a TV with such vivid colors.  I also decided to go with a modle that included dNIE.  This chip is only used when the TV is in dynamic mode which makes it set the contrast and brightness on it's own.  I haven't seen any immediate benefits from having this extra chip in the TV.  In fact, I have it turned off most of the time because I have the contrast and brightness manually set.  There are lots of connections for hooking up all o the things I run into my TV (Playstation 3, Wii, DVD/VCR Combo, Surround Sound, Tivo, and my PC are all connected and there's room for more).All in all, this is an impressive TV.  I think I would have been just as impressed with the slightly cheaper model without the dNIE chip.  I would certainly recommend this TV to anyone who is in the market for a TV in this price range.  If you're looking at something a little cheaper, pay attention to the Contrast Ratio, I think it's been the most impressive feature, and it's worth paying a little more for it now (instead of having to buy a new TV to upgrade it later).", "Date": "March 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "This TV is amazing....", "Author": "Miss Marples \"Lady D.\"", "ReviewID": "R1U4HDLJ1GE1Y3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The picture is so incredible, so life-like, it doesn't even seem like I'm watching television.

I hope I never have to change this review!  Overall I'm pretty pleased with this model.  As in other reviews, there is reflection due to the glass panel, as compared to regular lcd tv's.  My room has lots of south facing windows, so sunlight was a concern.  After seeing the reflection, I considered returning the set, but changed my mind after going back to stores to look at the other lcd screens again.  The reflection issue is well worth the improved quality of picture.  So I took a little time getting used to the reflection and adjusting my room.  Honestly, the reflection is only visible in dark scenes and for the most part is avoidable with a slight turn of the screen or is minor enough to ignore. This set is definitely one of the best lcd tv's around.  Now compared to plasma... yes there are some miniscule differences for the very picky, but it's pretty darn close to plasma quality viewing, and I prefer the lighter model that I can move myself.  My only gripe is the remote control, which is not set up for quick changes like switching from 16:9 to widefit mode.  you have to go through submenus to make changes.

I am not a fussy person, so the fact that the TV remote is not compatible with the cable remote does not bother me. It took me the better part of two weeks to get the color like we saw it in the showroom. The controls are not terribly intuitive and the manual does not offer preferred settings. But I found out after about seven days of fiddling with the controls that there are literally dozens of forums online where this information is available. The TV itself is very easy to connect to a surround-sound system. It is literally plug and play. On some of my favorite TV shows, it almost seems like I can reach into the screen and touch the people. The experience is really overwhelming at times. We don't have Blu-Ray, so I cannot comment on compatibility. But hands down, I would recommend this TV to anyone. The delivery service predicted that the TV would arrive in one week, but the TV showed up in five days.

After doing lots of research and visiting some forums I started getting discouraged with buying an HDTV at all, some people had clouding, some had stuck pixels, some didn't like the AMP, blah blah blah. Well, those are the minority. Most people will buy this TV, love it, and hopefully never have issues with it.I ordered mine on a Friday. On Saturday I got an email from Amazon that it had shipped. On Monday CEVA called me and said the TV was here and they could deliver it Tuesday between 1-5PM (I live in Boston, so delivery times could definately vary if you're further from a warehouse). Two guys showed up at 2:00, weren't particularly chatty or anything, but they were professional and did what was needed. They brought the TV up, set it up, connected the cable box, and made sure it worked. Then I signed for the order, and I had my new TV.The picture is simply amazing. The blacks are black, the colors are bright, and the viewing angle is great. The speakers are nothing to write home about, but like all high end TV's, it really needs to be hooked up to external speakers if you want the audio quality to match the video quality. The remote isn't great, but it's not terrible; it does the job fine.I've yet to receive my Blu-ray player (should be here tomorrow), but I've tested it with Comcast HD (1080i), Comcast SD, Xbox 360 (some 1080p games, some 720p games, and DVD's), and my PC via the VGA input. All the sources look great. I actually find that the TV does a better job than the Xbox of de-interlacing/stretching DVD's.

McKay", "ReviewID": "RWQR1P23AN9I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched HD TV's for a few weeks before going with the Samsung A650.  I had a Toshiba Cinema series 35\" tube and this choice is even better than what I expected.  There were many TVs for less money.  Our old TV was about 12 years old and was still in excellent condition.  Considering this will be our main source of TV entertainment for the next dozen years, a few hundered dollars today seems like a good decision for getting the latest technology and the most enjoyment out of the investment - since even a less expense TV is still a significant cost.I have seen many HDTVs with pictures that were less than acceptable especially with non-HD material, which is still most of what you will be watching.  Setting the TV on 16:9, when your program is not high def it automatically adjusts for the correct screen size (putting black bars on the sides for 4:3 and on the top/bottom for various wide screen formats).  This way you don't get the fat squatty people you see so often on these screens.  Even when watching HD channels, most of the older programming (2yrs+) is in 4:3.  Prime time and news + most movies are in high def 16:9.The 120hz motion engine comes preset to medium (options: off, low, medium, high).  In this mode the people look like a soap opera or video game with overly crisp motion and a 3-D feel to the scenes.  Some people like this as it creates the feeling you are in the scene with the actors.  I changed it to the \"low\" setting and it creates a much more natural look for me.The screen is a bit more reflective than the A550, but comparing them side by side the colors were richer with the A650 and the relection is not significant.  My room has an entire wall of windows and the TV is very watchable in that environment during the day.  That also brings up the brightness of LCD over the Plazma TVs.  You can quickly change the video mode from \"dynamic\" \"standard\" and \"movie\".  In \"standard\" and \"dynamic\" the screen is very bright and crisp with excellent contrast.  In the evening I switch to \"move\" which creates a more movie theater like environment swith rich colors and dark blacks.The \"touch of color\" is a very classy touch on the frame.  It is a band of red across the top an bottom behind a slightly curved clear accrylic frame.  It is very subtle and you don't have to worry about it \"clashing\" with your rooms colors (my wifes 1st concern).  Now that it is in the room, she thinks it looks as great as I do!About size, I probably could have gone with the 52\" instead of the 46\".  Originally we were thinking the 42\" but salepeople told us that you need to go at least 10\" bigger than your old TV (a 35\" tube) to create the illusion of being larger.  Since much of the programming is still 4:3, the actual screen size of those shows are not much bigger than our old TV, although the HD programming (HD channels prime time and HD premium channels) along with Blu-Ray bring out the full glory of the screen.  Since the TV is so thin compared to the bulky tube TVs, it has a much smaller presence in the room - especailly not extending into the room so invasively.  Don't get me wrong, we love the 46\", but can see that a 52 inch (what's 6\"?) would have worked just fine too.  We are both glad we did not go with the 42\".

Price, instant availablity, free shipping and no sales tax made it easy to use Amazon over the other options, like Best Buy ($50 cheaper, but add sales tax, pick it up and transport it myself and wait for 30 days to get it). Quick setup instructions were clear and easy to follow, and the detailed connection pages in the owner's manual took care of other questions. After getting it connected to Dish Network and our Bose home theater system we turned it on and WOW! What an incredibly clear, sharp and detailed picture! We put in WALL-E to check the DVD capability and it was like being in a high end movie theater. The only real complaint we have is the glossy screen. While we love the aesthetics of it (the TV is absolutely beautiful from a styling standpoint) it does reflect outside light. Our living room has panoramic windows that face Southwest and we get major sun in the afternoons. As long as you are 10 feet or less from the screen and facing it directly it is OK, but any further back are at an angle and you definitely get glare. That said, we have no other complaints at all, just praise. Hollywood stars are in big trouble, because you see every line, wrinkle and makeup flaw on this TV. The depth of color is fantastic and unlike other reviewers I don't notice any problem with the black definition. We do recommend that you hook it up to a good quality home theater system for sound as the built in speakers are weak, and you should turn them off using the system menu as they have a slight lag with the home theater system that makes is sound like a cheap reverb system from the 60's. We also have to once again comment on the sheer beauty of this TV from a styling standpoint. The simplicity of the screen surround and its subtle deep red tint make it an absolutely beautiful piece of functional art. Oh, and the remote is way cool - if you get near it it senses that and lights up all of the buttons. The menus are easy to use and well documented, and so far we are fully satisfied with the factory settings for picture and color.

It's amazing what HDTV looks like on this set. I am confused by one thing, though. It says it has 120Hz, but no matter what HD show I have on, the highest it ever reads is 60Hz. I even tried putting on a football game where is there is lots of movement, but it still read 60Hz. I checked the manual and when I changed setting to the highest option, it ruined the quality of the picture. I don't think it's the HDMI cable because that says it handles that output. Maybe Directv cannot handle 120Hz? Any insight anyone can give me on this would be appreciated. Overall, I love this television.

While it did take me almost a week to get, it was FREE!!The tv itself is fantastic. The picture quality is amazing, the menus are easy to navigate, set up was a cinch, and it isn't heavy at all.There are some minor details I wish I could change, though. The buttons on the tv are touch sensitive buttons, so there aren't actually any buttons to press. It is difficult to see where the buttons are; so much in fact I rarely use them. Also, the picture-in-picture doesn't work with two components hooked up (for instance, a ps3 and cable/satellite), but with one component and \"air\" tv. This is the case for a lot of tvs, but I would prefer to have it the other way. Finally, the automotion plus feature (120hz refresh) makes video games and sports look AMAZING, but for regular tv it makes everything look like a soap opera (best way to describe it).

This is an amazing piece of technology. I am an electrical engineering professor, with some of my research involving the kind of solid state lighting used in LCD systems like this, but I really had no idea how good the picture and sound would be. The sound system we are using is built around a 10 year old 5.1 Dolby Sony receiver, with only standard RCA audio cable inputs and a fairly basic Cambridge Soundworks speaker system. I had planned to upgrade this at some point, but wanted to see how it sounds with the new TV and HD content from our local Time-Warner system before making an additional investment. It sounds so good, that there seems to be no reason to change. We used HDMI cables to connect to the DVR (from T-W) and a Samsung Blu-Ray player, which really cleaned up the former rats nest we had with the old TV. Our old DVDs look great upconverted to 1080p. In fact, we see no reason to replace any of our DVDs with Blu-Rays, since the improved quality, while obvious, does not justify the additional cost.Our purchase and delivery experiences with Amazon were also excellent.Update 4 January 2012.

I did a lot of research before buying this tv, which involved many trips to local stores to see which tv was the best.  And it was this one.Let me first say that don't worry about the reflection/glare level of this tv, I don't notice it unless it is off, while watching the tv I don't see any reflections as the picture is bright enough to carry it.  I like probably many people between the 630, 650 and 750 (and even the 850).  Well all these tvs use the same panel they just add little extra things.  The 630 has slightly less contrast ratio.  The biggest and number one turn off from the other TVs is that when I was looking at them in local stores I noticed the ToC seperating and cracking along the edges.  It looked AWFUL.  While I do like the square look of the other models, I just couldn't put myself in a position that would have this quality issue.  So do yourself a favor and check out the other models in local stores to see this for yourself, look at different angles of light hitting it (it's usually on the edge right where the color meets the clear part around the bezel).  The 650 is the only model I didn't see it on (even the 950 had this problem).Picture and quality is great.  Amazing for the price level of this tv.  There are plenty of options to adjust picture and really I didn't have to tweak much except lowering the backlighting.  The Auto Motion Plus is a great feature for sports and that is about it.  If it's on during just about anything else it makes everything look sped up and unatural. So unless I am watching sports, I have it set to \"Off\".This doesn't affect my score as this is about the TV, but Amazon and CEVA (shipping company) was great.  I ordered the TV Friday morning, and TV was trying to be delivered that Sunday morning (unfortunetly I missed the call, but I picked it up as the place was local on Monday).  Can't get much faster than that.  Also, Amazon had best price out there, especially when it's coupled with the [....] card.So in the end, if you are on the fence about which TV to buy trust the over 700 positive reviews this tv has, and pull the trigger on this model and this Samsung.  I feel very strongly that Samsung makes the best LCDs out there.  I also looked at some Sony's, Toshiba's, and Vizio's and nothing comes close, it's really not contest that the Samsung's have the best picture.

I had already experienced HD on a decent set, so I wasn't blown away by it, but it was everything I had expected.  I expected perfection and that's what I got.  No overscan, clear, bright, and detailed picture.  No complaints and great quality.  I watched the Super Bowl on it and I didn't notice any motion blur at all.  Lots of options for tweeking the picture settings.  I'm getting professional calibration in about a month, so I'm going to assume the picture will be even better, but out of the box the settings are quite nice and I'm pleased.While I wasn't \"blown away\" by HD Cable, I was blown away by Blu-ray discs on this tv.  Whether it's the 1080p, or the set itself, or a combination of both, I don't know, but what I do know is that movies like The Nightmare before Christmas, Big Fish, and Wall-E, look outstanding (the 3 BRs I have).  Almost 3D at times (often, multiple, multiple times through the movie!!).  You can see all the details and clarity in the picture.  It's almost memorizing.  I'm a new big fan of Blu-ray!!Gaming on this set is nice.  It's a decent upgrade in size for me, and gaming is very, very decent.  It's big enough, bright enough, and I have yet to notice any lag input with my games (via HDMI2/PC and game mode on the component connections).  So gaming is good and just what I expected it to be.The only cons of this set would be SD cable kind of looks crappy.  It crops the picture on the sides, and of course the clarity isn't that of HD.  Nothing I really didn't expect, and of course the picture is more than watchable.  The sound on the tv I can't comment on as I have it hooked up to my stereo speakers.  If I had room (and the money) for additional surround sound pieces, I would pick them up, but at this time, I'm more than satisfied with the sound through my stereo speakers.  I have no clue why lots of people complain about the remote.  It's no modern marvel of technology, but it's simply a remote.  Easy to use and responsive.The ToC bezel is a non issue.  I don't notice it unless I look for it.  The same can be said about the reflective screen.  My room has a ton of light in it during the day and the tv looks great.  Of course look for reflection in any tv during a black screen, and I think you'll be able to see it.  All in all, with all of the HDMI ports, 2 components, and various other connection options, this tv is just as great as everyone says.  There's no reason not to get it.It's a great modern LCD that's definitely worth the money.  I don't see any other tv in this price range, with the features it has, this size, backed by a quality name like Samsung, and with as many positive reviews comparing to this set.  Coming from someone that is fairly specific about the quality of his tv and did his homework for 3 plus months on this very set, pick up this tv.  As hundreds of others have said, you won't regret it.", "Date": "February 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "As good as it gets", "Author": "Milton \"mtn biker\"", "ReviewID": "RH0RRZBV214N8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV rocks.

I upgraded to this series 6, 46-inch TV a couple of weeks ago and so far I am very satisfied. I love the Samsungs and when I searched for a new TV I even didn't look for another brand.I still remember my good friend bought another samsung, 42-inch,  for $2200 a couple of years ago. If you consider that, I think it is amazing how fast the technology has improved and the prices have dropped.My friend is already thinkiing about upgrading to a new one (his TV does not support 1080p), so I think the best thing about this TV is that the Series 6 has pretty much all the features that you will need from years to come without feeling that you need to switch it for a newer version in the next couple of years. I am planning to keep this TV for at least 8 to 10 years.Pros: great image, size. I read other comments saying that the image looks \"too real\" and I have to say that it is true; however, the TV has pre-set modes for images and when you set it up on \"game\" looks just fine and perfect. The other pre-set modes look might make it look a little different to the type of image one is used to.Cons: So far I can't think of anything except for the \"touch of red\" which I am not crazy about. I heard about \"sound\" being a big con, but I have my TV conected to an independent sound system, so I cannot really tell.I will totally recommend this TV for the price.", "Date": "January 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Super Price--Super Service--Super TV", "Author": "Barry C.

Buying from Amazon and not having to even touch the TV until it was set up definitely rocks!  The reflection from the TV, a point of concern listed by several persons, is not an issue any more than it would be on a CRT TV.  I prefer it because the colors come through much better than a matte screen.  Set up was easy through the remote.  The wheel on the remote is not bad, and I often push the outer ring in whatever direction I want rather than trying to turn the wheel with my fingers like an IPod.  This is effective.  I have no complaints about the set, and although red is not my favorite color, the Touch of Color red along the outside of the TV frame actually looks good. Buying this set is a no-lose proposition, and I think this set is all you really need vs. buying a few more bells and whistles in the 750 or 850 series.

Once he got the TV out of the box, he bear hugged it to put it on my TV table. With his coat making contact with the screen. I think the screen was still wrapped, but I'm not sure. In any event, I think he could have handled it better. He just seemed like he was in a big hurry to get to his next stop. He did plug it in to make sure it was working.

It looks amazing, I love this tv, and it's worth every penny.  My only complaint about the tv, is that sometimes when I'm playing my xbox and have my headphones plugged in and I switch to watching a movie on my xbox 360 the sound will start coming out of the tv speakers and the headphones.  I don't know why it does this, but I'm not too concerned with this because my living situation that makes me use headphone as to not disturb my roommates is temporary.  Just something I felt other people might want to know.  I still love this tv, and wouldn't return it at all.As for the cheap remote everyone is talking about, I don't mind it all that much.  The scroll wheel can be a little difficult to use if your not used to it.  I kind of like it, although I will be replacing it with a Logitech Harmony 890 when my gf moves in because she won't be able to figure out the army of remotes I have for the living room.I was a little disappointed with the white glove delivery though.

First, the TV looks great in the room. It wastes no space, its glossy black finish is sharp, and its lines are sleek. As for the touch-of-red color, this is a very, very subtle effect that adds a small touch of distinction. I would not hesitate to purchase this TV based on any concerns about the Touch of Color feature.When you are seated directly in front of the set, the picture quality is outstanding. As you move off to an angle, the color saturation begins to deteriorate, as is common with LCD screens.The connectivity is generally excellent, with 4 HDMI inputs. The only criticism I have regarding connectivity is relevant only if you have older components that require using S-Video or RCA cables: the TV has only one S-Video/RCA input and it is on the side, rather than tucked neatly away in the back.Regarding sound, the internal speakers are acceptable and the sound output does a good job of sending audio signal to external amplifiers. My only criticism here is the odd way in which changing the volume requires repeated taps of the remote's volume button. Unlike with other TVs, you can't just press and hold the volume button until it reaches the desired level. Instead, you must press the volume button repeatedly, as the volume increases or decreases by a single digit with each press.Other than the odd volume control, the remote works well. Although I agree with other reviewers that the wheel control is finicky and a bit annoying, the remote is designed so that you don't really need to use the wheel, which operates controls that can be navigated easily with regular directional buttons placed around the wheel. The on-screen menu is reasonably intuitive and allows one to navigate an array of picture settings that is both impressive and potentially overwhelming. I recommend that you start with the excellent calibrated settings offered by CNET (go to [...]) rather than the factory defaults, and then make adjustments to your taste.Finally, Amazon's delivery was efficient and as promised.

I typically us AVS forums to get good color settings and haven't even bothered with this TV.120Hz processing has not created any noticeable screen jutter than I can see or tell, nor could my brother-in-law when watching with me.  HD sports look absolutely amazing.Some people complain about the glossy screen and light reflection in a bright room.  Unless the sun is shinning into the room through the window directly, this has not been a problem.  And what little there is has been no worse than any other TV I've owned.The preset Entertainment settings for audio and video are also easy to use from the remote and good settings.  It makes it nice to easily change from a bright daylit room to a darker room by switching to/from the Cinema/Movie setting and not having to do custom changes in the settings menu.The ability to customize audio/video settings for each independent input is also nice.  It allows you to customize to the source which depending on if it is a game system, DVD player, etc. may vary your desired settings.The picture quality is also very strong, at 52\" and 1080p I lose most if not all screen door effect after moving 3-4 feet from the TV.  The newslink feature to get local weather and news through USA Today is a nice plus, but one I don't use since we get the same features from DirecTV plus their on Demand service.I have been extremely pleased with this set overall and would definitely buy another Samsung TV.

Before I had DirecTv's HD service hooked up, I was a little worried since the quality of the Tv highlighted the flaws in the standard def signal, but as soon as I put in a DVD (not even Blue-ray at that point) I was blown away. One week later HD was set up, and I will never look back!!There are a bunch of other features that I plan on utilizing at a later date (like hooking it up to the internet and my computer).

McGlasson \"Kingspiper\"", "ReviewID": "R3H2M71HCOLAUQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I, like so many other guys (and gals), who before a major purchase do all the research.  Watch, listen or read anything about the product and reviews.  Wonder and worry about paying too much and the technoligical reliability or repair issues. Compare product after product looking for the best bang for the buck.  It took me over a year to finally decide to buy this TV.  I then waited a few months more, as I saw the price dropping.  BOTTOM LINE:  THIS TV ROCKS!The weight of the set is very light 49 lbs. if I remember correctly.  That helps when it's only me and my lovely 125 lbs. wife trying to move it around and attach it to the mounting system.The picture is fantastic.  I was very concerned about the glare issue others have raised, since I do have a rather large picture window in the room. Luckily it has not been a problem at the current angle the tv is set and I do not believe that it would be an issue anyway.  The picture can be set to higher lighting conditions and in my opinion it seems to compensate very well.The touch of red surrounding the screen is very elegant and exudes refinement. I spent a whole day reading through the 115 page manual trying out the different functions and just having a ball.SETUP: The box comes with some pop out plastic plugs at the bottome center.  Once removed the top slides up and off easily.  This is a great feature that bypasses box cutters and the stress of their deployment.We pulled off the mounting bolts from the back and measured up the new ones supplied with the mount. We bolted on the supports and proceeded to remove the stand. The bottom stand is a little stubborn to get off. By detaching four small screws at the bottom rear of the set you can disconnect it from the stand.  Use a magnetic screw driver with a phillips head since they are located in deeply recessed holes.  The last one would not come out until we lifted the set up to relieve the weight on the screw.  We replaced the hole left by the stand with a supplied cover that snapped in perfectly.  We the mounted the TV to the stand, connected the various HDMI (there are 4 ports, yes really 4 of them!) within a few minutes of setup menu's, we where watching the Mummy Returns on DirectTV in HD.Then the WOW's started. My wife walked in and said, \"WOW!\"  My teenagers each walked in and said, \"WOW! Cool!\"  And finally I said, \"yeah, WOW!\"I was very pleased.The only con to this whole experience was the CEVA logistics delivery.  I would tell them what time I was to be at home and they would show up at a completely different time when I was gone.

The 650 was shipped from Dallas and arrived in Tulsa in exactly one week. The shipping carton bottom was clean.  No stickers were on the TV. The set appeared to be brand new. Delivery man put the batteries in the remote and quickly left.  I couldn't get my newly rented Cox Cable HDTV box with Monoprice HDMI cable to talk to the 650 so I connected the 650 straight to the cable outlet and did an automatic channel search.  The search took something like 15 minutes.  During the search the 650 found all the channels, then it did an automatic one at a time scrambled channel delete.  On Cox here in Tulsa the local HDTV broadcast channels are unscrambled.  Didn't see a single bad pixel or any of the other bad LCD stuff you read about.  In doing my first channel surf, after setting SD to 4:3, I immediately found that the words from the speakers at the bottom of the 650, on many channels, didn't exactly match the lips of the announcers.  Secondly some of the SD channels had bad picture quality and some of the SD channels (local FOX especially) had outstanding SD quality.  The HDTV picture quality ranged from OK to blow your socks off.  The blacks on my 650 are even blacker than black and I saw no motion blurs in the factory default setting. Glare, with the set turned on, is not an issue.  They say you should set 10 feet back from this 46\" set.  I say 12 to 14 feet is better.

So we had to use a kitchen magnet to get them out. That can be exhausting if you have just finished assembling a new mount for the TV.

The Touch of Color is VERY subtle, almost unnoticeable.  There is some glare but not enough to be of concern.  The colors are spot on! Blacks are a rich, deep, glossy ink black with good shadow detail.  Razor sharp images.  I just saw a friends Pioneer Plasma Elite Kuro Pro and this set can hold it's own against the Kuro.  The Kuro may have a little better shadow detail but it's not nearly as bright as this one. The Kuro has a little less screen glare but it was not that much better. And this is much cheaper than the Kuro.  Too bad these LCD's don't go much a above 52-55\"; plasmas still reign at these large sizes.One suggestion: Turn down the sharpness to around 10.  The picture will actually improve with more detail visible.Summary: If a high quality picture is paramount to you, this LCD beats everything out there including those overpriced Sony's.Other notes: I avoided the 750 series due to halo effect and pealing bezel issues.  Also Amazon had it in my house in three business days!

The tv volume is just fine though.Update 12/17/08The volume problem was with how the DVD player was set up. Our home theater has a subwoofer, so the speaker setup for the DVD player specified small for our front speakers. I changed the DVD speaker configuration to large and the volume when listening through the tv improved dramatically.Altough I do notice some video artifacts on the screen from time to time, such as some pixelation I am very happy with the picture.

This set got very little use for the last 2.5 years, and this started happening after we started using it again to replace the smaller set in our home office.  After doing just a little research on Google, it appears that this is a relatively common issue with Samsung LCD TVs.  Personally, I don't believe that the repair cost would be worth it since the prices of LCDs have come down so much in the last 4 years, I will probably just buy a new one.  Yes, I am disappointed but not surprised.  Like the adage says, they simply don't make things like they used to.-----After doing serious research for our first LCD/HD TV by physically going to over 10 \"big box\" stores and reading countless articles, reviews, etc., I decided on this 46\" Samsung 650 Series.  I wanted 120Hz, an outstanding picture, reduced glare and as many HDMI inputs as possible.  This TV had it all!  With a 3 year old in the house I also liked the glass covering the screen.  I don't know how much abuse it can take, but at least it is something \"extra\" to provide a little protection for the screen.  At first I though that the glass would increase the glare because we have the TV in a bright room but it didn't at all.  It actually has less glare than our older regular TV!Here is what I have hooked up (so far) and everything looks amazing:  Dish Network TurboHD, Playstation 3 (for Blue Ray discs which aer simply amazing on this set), a 5 disc HDMI DVD player and an older surround sound system.  Everything works and sounds great!  I didn't even hook up the surround until today because I loved the way that the TV speaker sounded.  I was actually surprised at how good you can make it sound.Why I bought from Amazon (and why I am REALLY GLAD that I did!):After comparing prices at retail outlets, this TV ranged from $1999 (on sale) to $2399.  That was simply too much for us so I was leaning toward the 40\" which I could find for $1499 on sale.  This didn't include tax.  Then, when I decided to check online sources, I found the 46\" here for a little under $1600 with no tax and free delivery.  That was perfect so I snatched it up!  One thing that I didn't know about the free shipping was that it included \"White Glove\" service which was extremely helpful.  \"White Glove\" means that the delivery service will bring it to you, take it out of the box, help you set it up and even make sure that it works with your setup.  This was great for me because it would have been almost impossible for me to mount this on the stand by myself.  Not having to transport, carry, or even unpack this big TV was worth at least another $150 in my book!  Another great savings from Amazon.Added note on delivery:  When I purchased the TV it said that delivery would take 14 days... I got it in 3... and I live 160 miles from anywhere.BOTTOM LINE:  It would be VERY hard to beat this TV and the service from Amazon.com.

It became very clear to me in a very short time that the Samsung LN46A650 was the LCD TV for me.I had never bought anything of this dollar value over the net before,so I was a little reluctant.I happened to call Samsung directly with questions on the extended warranty and ask the person there if they had any problems with Amazon purchases. He told me that he personally had ordered 3 tv through Amazon.com and had fantastic luck.On hearing his confidence I ordered my TV on labor Day Monday. I received periodic updates on it's location. The following Monday I received a call from the carrier telling me it would be delivered by 5pm that night, which just happened to be the GREEN BAY PACKERS home opener against the vikings.

They offered a great price on the TV when I ordered it and their shipping was fast. I ordered this TV on September 4th and it was delivered on the 9th. I was in class the day this monster came, but luckily I got my parents to check for damages and such.The first thing I did when I came home was hooked everything up and calibrated my inputs. Then I immediately started playing some PS3 games (Skate and GT:5P which BTW both look amazing). Then my cousin came over and we tried out some Wii and some HD late night talk shows.Then last night I watched my first Blu-Ray movie (Sunshine to be exact); By the end of the flick I had to pick my jaw up off the floor and get a mop to clean up the drool. I watched this flick with another cousin of mine who was on the fence about Blu-Ray, and well after this movie he was convinced of the true difference in Blu.Anyways to get down to specifics on the TV itself. The TV offers amazing PQ right out of the box, but if calibrated it looks even better. (I recommend checking the AVSforum.com calibration settings thread for this TV). I get local HD channels from Comcast and they look superb.I have my Wii hooked up via component to my receeiver (Onkyo TX-SR606 to be exact) and then I have HDMI from the receiver to the TV. I have my receiver pass the Wii signal untouched and this TV does an awesome job of upscaling the Wii. My one cousin said he noticed some slight blurring in the upscaled signal but I couldn't notice it.Now two of the big issues people (can sometimes) have about this TV are purple haze and clouding. Purple haze is when you see a slight purple colored haze over your blacks. I did some basic tests on my set and didn't seem to have any purple haze (most times people don't have this issue). The other issue people have is clouding or more specifically when light behind the screen bleeds through creating a clouding effect on parts of the screen. (Most common around edges but it can move towards the center) I can say that my set has hardly any clouding if any at all.This two issues can scare some people to a point that they may decide against this set. Well I can say do not be one of these people, because this TV is amazing and you'd be hard pressed to find a better series of TVs (Samsung's 9 series would really be the only thing better than the 6 series.)I can say that the remote and the on screen menus are easy to use / navigate. I've had no issues with this TV so far. I've even hooked my PC up to this TV. I use this hook up mainly for games and emulation.I've spent many hours doing research on this TV and am very pleased. I would recommend this TV to anyone. If you have any doubts or need further info beyond this review you can either contact me or go to AVSForum.comBasically, (for those that want the short version)PROS:+Amazing PQ on all sources.+Easy to navigate remote and OSD+Great bang for your buck+Minimal if any at all off angle viewing issues+Minimal if any at all clouding / purple haze (There is ways to control these two, but if they are really bad you could probably just send this TV back for a new one)+Extreme happiness and amazement, as in this TV will blow you away.CONS:-The TV may take a few seconds longer then normal to turn onAgain if you need a good place to get good advice I recommend AVSForum.com and although Amazon may say I'm not technically an owner of this product, well I am, it's just that I ordered it under my dad's account.Well now that I've added my two cents on this TV I am going to enjoy it some more.Tech NOTE: For those interested I have a(n)...Sony 80gb PS3 (the old one with PS2 BC, SACD Support, 4 USBs, and Media Card support)Onkyo TX-SR606 (amazing receiver for the price)Nintendo WiiBasic cable from Comcast with locals in HDCreative SR750 7.1 700 Watt surround system.

My wife and I went to BB to take a look at it and wrote down the pricing for it.  I then came home and looked on Amazon and noticed it was $500 cheaper and had an average of 5 stars across 270+ reviews.  We obviously decided to purchase the TV through Amazon.The TV was purchases on Wednesday and arrived in Minneapolis MN on Friday of that week (a full week ahead of the estimated delivery date).  I got a call from CEVA/EAGLE/DASH Delivery here in Minneapolis and got the delivery all setup.  I was a little worried about the delivery as I had read some mixed reviews from people saying the \"White glove\" service sucked.  As for my experience, that statement couldn't be farther from the truth.  The delivery man called 30 mins before he was going to show up.  When he did show up he was super nice and seemed almost as excited about me getting the TV as I was.  He carried it in the house and took it out of the box, he even put down a little mat on my carpet in case the box was dirty.  We then set the TV up on my TV stand and got everything connected.  He then turned on the TV and went through all the setup with me and even went through each menu on the TV to show me what each menu did.  We then checked every input on the TV to very that each input worked.  We then checked for dead/stuck pixels.  He even went over how I should clean the screen on it so I don't scratch it or cause it to fog up.Conclusion - This TV has the most amazing picture I have ever seen and for those worried about the delivery service, at least in Minneapolis MN the service as beyond amazing.", "Date": "September 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best Television I've ever watched", "Author": "Eric Burns \"Burns\"", "ReviewID": "R2DB57DFVKRKDN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Television by far is the most spectacular television I've ever watched.

The red bezel is stunning!I was torn over whether to purchase it from a Big Box Store or Amazon.  The Big Box actually matched Amazon's price and told me I could have the TV in a week. HOWEVER they also wanted to charge me a delivery fee, a set up fee, and kept pushing a calibration session (for a fee). All of a sudden their price match was a mis-match and I decided to go with Amazon. I ordered the set on Monday and it was in my house on Thursday!As for delivery from CEVA... very impressive service! As I said, I oredered the set on Monday and they called me on Weds offering a choice of delivery days--  Thurs or Friday.  I chose Thursday between 1:00 and 5:00  The delivery man was at my house by 2:00.  He was very polite and very helpful.  He brought the set inside my house, unpacked the box, put the set on the stand, and had me turn it on to make sure I had sound and picture. He offered to take the packing boxes away but I decided to keep them... just in case.Thank you Amazon for having great products in stock at great prices.

I have it connected to PS3, Wii, HDTV cable set-top box and all look amazing...much better than on my previous HDTV which is about 2 years old.  Since I have a PS3, I didn't \"need\" the extra features of the 750 model since the PS3 is DLNA compliant and hooks up to my Media-Center PCs anyway.  If you have a PS3 then save the $$$ and get this model vs. the 750 series.  If you do not have a PS3, you may want to buy this model AND a PS3 for about the same price as the 750 series cost and get much better value for your money, especially since the PS3 is the highest rated blu-ray player at this time.  That is exactly what I did.Black levels are amazing, especially for an LCD.  Not only do HDTV signals look great on this TV, but analog signals look better too. I have not noticed any artifacts or motion blur, even during fast-paced action such as X-games, baseball, etc.  My parents have almost the exact same TV, except that theirs is a 2007 model....and this one looks noticeably better than theirs.  I attibute that to the improvements Samsung made for the 2008 model year.I actually like the red TOC around the edge of the frame, but for those that are wondering about it; it is barely noticable.  Not nearly as noticable as it is on the 750 series.It does a great job of upconverting to fill the screen with picture rather then leaving black bars on the sides like my previous HDTV did.  Blu-Ray discs played via the PS3 are wonderful on this set.  I never would have thought that blu-ray discs would have been all that much beter than standard DVDs but I was quickly proven wrong.My only complaints are that the PIP menu is not as easy to access as it should be and you cannot create custom names for the inputs.  IMO, if these two very minor issues were corrected then this would be a flawless TV.  I'm not going to let those two minor complaints lower my review though, just wanted everyone to be aware of this fact.  The custom named inputs are not that big of a deal for me because I play everything through a home theater system anyway.  A single button for PIP wold be nice though.

Everything from Xbox 360, to PS3, to Blu-Ray movies look amazing on it, and I actually like the functionality and ease of use the TV has.  The picture is beautiful, sharp, and the blacks are deep and inky.  Having easy access to all the inputs, and the 4 HDMIs, is a great feature.  I don't have any problems with the remote, as I have heard other people complain about.  I'll most likely purchase a Logitech down the road, anyway.The TV is surprisingly light for its size, which is nice when we wanted to rearrange our living room to accomodate it.  I have been researching LCD's for a while, looking for the right one at a good price, and I am definitely more than satisfied with my purchase.Now CEVA's shipping, on the other hand, was absolutely ridiculous.  They called me the day before delivery, and asked what floor I lived on (5th), if there is an elevator (no), and what time I would prefer it to be delivered (morning).  I took a half day off from work to have it delivered, and they ended up not showing up until almost 4 o'clock.  When it finally showed up, I went downstairs to meet the driver.  He was unloading it, and asked if there was an elevator, and looked upset when I told him no.  I informed him that I indicated to the CEVA agent on the phone that I live in a 5th floor walk-up apartment.  He then \"asked\" me to help him carry it up.  Luckily, I am in great physical shape, but he was panting and wheezing by the time we reached the top.  He then realized that he left his truck in the middle of the street, and vehicles were honking at him to move it.  I told him he should go down and move it, but he refused.  He then said \"All I have to do is turn it on.\"  I had to tell him to be careful, as he hurridly opened the box and put the TV on my stand.  He then uttered \"There, beuatiful, it works\" and had me sign the delivery form.  I quickly made sure it did indeed work with my Xbox360 before he left, which was a challenge, as he dashed out of my apartment.Everything did work fine, but I did file a complaint with CEVA, although it was free shipping, so what do you expect?

They don't look that big when you look at them at the retail stores ( I bought it from Amazon, of course. I just went to a retail store to see what they look like). When I first got it, I had to push my furniture all the way against the wall, because the screen was so big, I just couldn't get used to it right away (I just upgraded from a 32 inch LCD). I'm in the process of buying a house with a nice recreational room, so pretty soon that won't be a problem anymore. Ok, about the TV:It looks just great.  It's just gorgeous and very nice to look at. The screen resolution is amazing. At the beginning, I just couldn't get used to the \"soap opera effect\", but after I turned it off I felt the movies looked even better. Although I own a PS3, I am not a gamer. I only use it to watch blu ray movies, and yes, you can appreciate even the smallest details in the picture. Sound wise, I feel it is just ok, but I don't mind because I have a home theater.Overall, I just feel that I got a great deal on it and I am extremely satisfied. Like many consumers, I did my research, and read as many reviews as possible.*****UPDATE 02/10/2010****Ok, this is an update on how I feel about this TV after a year of ownership.This is what I really HATE about the TV:1)The speakers: Those speakers are a joke. They are very weak. In fact, they make a distortion noise if you increase the volume. This matter, I don't care that much about, because I own a very good sound system, but it sucks when I just want to watch regular television.2)Mode not supported message: This message will come up all of the sudden when I'm either playing with my PS3, or when watching a blu ray movie. I spoke to both Samsung, and Sony and their solution was to bring down the resolution to 1080 I ( and I still have the same problem), or below (720 or lower). Then my question arises \"why in hell did I spend that much in a HDTV if I can't watch a stupid movie in 1080 p whenever I feel like it????If my tax return is what I'm expecting it to be, I may just enjoy throwing a dam hammer at this overpriced tv.Other than that it's a cute looking tv", "Date": "November 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV", "Author": "B.

I almost didn't keep the Samsung because it had so much \"ghosting\" that the Philips didn't show at all. The solution I came to was setting the \"Auto Motion Plus 120hz\" to MEDIUM (I'd say they shouldn't even have low and high, just off and on, at the medium setting).Other than that, the viewing angle is alright, but also not as good as the Philips. I had a Mistubishi that was the same way, you lose contrast as soon as you move from directly in front. but it's not a huge issue or what I'd really call a problem. The Samsung stays much cooler than the Philips and the menu system is great. A lot of people complain about the remote, but I don't have a problem with it. If you hate the wheel, push down on it instead of spinning, it works that way too. (nice looking, glossy, \"beefy\" remote, too.)the WiseLink feature knows when I load a DVD and switches to the DVD input, even though the player's not Samsung (...using a HDMI cable).I haven't plugged in an ethernet cable to try the infolink feature, but it's kinda cool to know it's an option.Overall, I'm very happy with the Samsung, and Amazon's price was about $500 less than the local electronic's retailer's best match offer.I almost forgot, mine came with one side of the box smashed which I took photos of before I even opened the box. When I removed the TV I found a scuffed area on the glossy frame. Though it seriously bothers me, I didn't file a complaint, but I know had I returned the TV for whatever reason, they would've said I did it and tried to make me pay for the damage.

The tech guy (not the friendly Tier 1 operator) said this TV will not except a 1080p signal but it will display in the progressive (not the interlaced) mode.  That does not make much sense to me since I thought the \"p\" in progressive meant every line per frame was sent in the signal, and the \"i\" in interlaced meant that every other line was sent per frame to the screen.  If the TV displays every line per frame, why not except a signal with every line per frame.Also, the 120 Hz auto motion plus feature makes special effects where they use the green screen with real people look weird and distracting.

We are so glad we returned the Vizio and purchased this one (which rated high on Consumer Reports and cnet.com but also had a higher price tag.)  If you are in the market for a TV in this price range, my advice is don't buy the \"bargain brand\".  For about $100 more (no tax through Amazon and the price keeps dropping) we have a MUCH better TV.  The HD picture is obviously good but the SD picture is also very good - and this is straight out of the box - no adjustments.  (On the Vizio, we were constantly fiddling with all the adjustments to try and get a better picture.)  It is important for us to have good SD quality because our local channels are not available in HD through our satellite company yet and we watch a lot of network TV.The one thing we don't like is that the remote only works the TV!  Our satellite remote will work everything for basic functions, but it obviously won't access the TV menus, etc. so we are stuck having two remotes around.I highly recommend this TV and the purchase through Amazon, despite the delivery problems.

Consumersearch.com has great review articles. The picture quality is simply marvelous. So, why only 2 stars?Well, the 2 star rating has nothing to do with the auto-off.

The rating is a result of nagging issues such as long wait time for powering on, switching input sources, no audio when switching channels too quickly.False claims of PIP.  The PIP only works with non-HD source such as analog TV or VCR.  If you're trying to view two different HD source, forget it.For 1080P, again, the picture is fabulous when connecting to a Playstation 3 playing blu-ray.

TV makes rapid chirping sound prior to power supply issue. Google capacitor bulging for Samsung and you'd see it's common failure. As I open the back of the TV to repair it, I'd noticed that the power supply is probably designed in the 60's and Samsung buys these in bulk for their TV. There is a major difference between the printed circuit board on the power supply versus the rest of the TV. Granted that the power supply's only to convert AC to DC, you would think that Samsung engineers would understand the power utilities in the United States.Updated 2: Well, I should've replaced all 4 capacitors in the power supply during my first repair. At that time I'd only replaced those bulging ones. On the second year of ownership, the power supply stopped working again. I'd initially thought it was my repaired work (replaced bulging caps), but after opening the TV again, I've found the other 2 caps blew.

But you can't watch the picture because your view is constantly distracted by the glare from the bezel.My advice is to spend your money on an LCD with a more traditional metal or solid black frame.", "Date": "August 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV, Amazing buying experience at Amazon", "Author": "S.

Then I entered Samsung Warranty Hell, a process that I want to make everyone aware of before they buy products from Samsung.Stage 1: Getting your ticket online.  You fill out all of your information on their support web page and get a ticket number.  In my case I opted for an \"advance exchange\" -- Samsung put a hold on my credit card so that I could immediately obtain a replacement monitor, in advance of returning my failed unit.  Great!Stage 2: After nothing happens for a few days, you call their customer service line.  They tell you to keep waiting.Stage 3: After a few more frustrating calls to customer service, I asked for a supervisor who eventually referred me to Samsung's \"Executive Customer Relations Group\".  I was very quickly on the phone with a representative.  Great!Stage 4: This is when you learn from the ECR group that even though Samsung has placed a hold on your credit card, they cannot issue you a replacement monitor for 2-3 weeks.  Weeks???  I told them that was unacceptable, and after a couple more calls to the ECR group I was offered a refund instead.  I was told that the refund will take 2-3 weeks to arrive.  Great!  They sent me a UPS slip and I sent my broken monitor in.Stage 5: After waiting 3 weeks I called the ECR group back and was told that for some reason my refund was not processed.  They will email the refund department and call me back.  I have been promised a call back several times now, but never gotten one.Stage 6: Anger.  As things now stand, Samsung's ECR group keeps promising to call me back, that my problem has been escalated, etc.  They keep telling me that the \"refund department\", who they can only reach by email, is not answering their emails.I've dealt with Samsung firmly but politely throughout, and all I have gotten so far is a runaround.  They took my broken monitor but as of this writing I am still waiting for a refund, more than a month after they received my failed unit.  I really liked my monitor before it broke, but after this experience I will steer clear of all Samsung products and advise the reader to do the same.

I wish Samsung would offer a stripped down, monitor only version of this 120Hz set that is slightly less expensive.  For most people who will use this TV with cable or dish, the tuner is unnecessary.  When you use a modern AV receiver, you really only need a single HDMI input on the TV.  And, of course, you will never use the decent built-in speakers if you use external speakers in your home theater.  Add a universal remote, and the Samsung remote (which isn't great anyway) is worthless.  Connect a computer or gaming console and you no longer need Samsung's InfoLink to display Internet content or its ability to display photos from a memory card.

Friends and family, who also have hd tvs always comment on the great picture whenever they come over.Amazon \"Executive Customer Relations\":I actually had to order a replacement because my first tv was delivered damaged. There was some (cosmetic, i think) damage to the corner of the bezel. I called Amazon and explained the damage and the csr said a replacement would be ordered and sent out. Return of the damaged tv would need to be set up with the delivery company. Coordinating with the original delivery company for the return, a different shipping company for delivery of the replacement and Amazon actually was a really big mess for about two weeks.I was told by the csr that the new tv would be sent out right away and there would be a 30 day window to return the original. I scheduled the return and delivery of replacement for the same day. In the morning, the damaged set was picked up by the original delivery company. The replacement was scheduled for delivery later that day.Then I receive a call from the new shipping company saying they've been told by Amazon not to deliver the new tv. WHAT?! So I call Amazon and the csr could not help. 10 minutes later, around 1:30pm, i get en email from Amazon's \"Executive Customer Relations\" saying that the tv I returned was not the original 46\" I had ordered, but some other 40\" tv. And that they would not release the replacement tv until the original 46\" tv was returned to Amazon and confirmed.I knew this was impossible since the shipping guys had just picked up the damaged set that morning and there's no way Amazon could even know what was returned. I called the shipping company, the manager said that truck had JUST arrived st the warehouse and they haven't yet unloaded anything from the truck. So, I don't know how Amazon could have received any return item from me at all. Besides, what happened to the 30-day window for return?Anyway, this was a royal mess having to deal with this \"Executive Customer Relations\" dept. There's no number to contact them, just an email. I must have sent them 20 emails in the first 3 days since the issue and not one of them was responded to. In the end I finally received the replacement tv, but I was without any tv for about 2 weeks.

This Samsung LN46A650 replaced my 42\" Westinghouse monitor which I took to my office. For its MAIN intended use as a TV . . .  its superb.  HDTV broadcast over cable is beautiful and Blue Ray play back is just STUNNING !  Compared to my Westinghouse, the black level performance is breathtakingly better.  I've only had this unit for 2 weeks so I have not explored everything to the n-th degree.  I use this TV for my work almost 50% of the time.  This TV is used as a computer monitor for CAD drafting (AutoCad).IF . . . your use is 95% as a TV for movies and cable/satellite broadcast, you can't ask for a better TV.  4-1/2 STAR RATiNG AS A TV !CONS (USING AS A TV) :--> ONLY 3 CUSTOM SETTING -  If you are picky about PICTURE SETTINGS for different INPUTS, this TV DOES NOT allow a specific setting for each input.  I am used to being able to have specific setting for Cable, DVD/Blue Ray, Game and PC inputs.  There are 3 PICTURE MODES, \"Dynamic\", \"Standard\" and \"Movie\".  You do your specific tweaking for each mode THEN apply the \"Mode\" of choice to each input.  So far I have my Blue Ray connected to \"HDMI 1\" and my HD cable to \"Component\" and I was able to tweak to my heart's desire for both inputs.  BUT . . .  (continued below in \"used as computer monitor\")--> PIP IS ONLY FOR THE STANDARD DEFINITION \"ANTENNA/CABLE\" INPUT :  Only the analog input can be over-layed on the main picture.  YOU CAN NOT DISPLAY ANY COMPONENT, HDMI OR PC INPUT AS PIP SOURCE . . .  AND  YOU CAN NOT SWAP  PIP AND MAIN SCREEN.  I spent how much? . . . and I can't have an HD PIP while working on my computer ??  DISAPPOINTED !!--> NO PIP BUTTON ON THE REMOTE :  The only way to turn on the PIP is to go through the MAIN MENU . . .  very cumbersome.--> WORST DESIGNED REMOTE I'VE EVER USED - I hate it and so does everyone else.-----------------------CONS  (USING TV AS A COMPUTER MONITOR) : MY REASON for a 1 STAR RATING OVERALL-->> NOT ALL ADJUSTABLE SETTINGS WORK WITH ALL \"MODES\" OR \"INPUTS\" -  I connected my laptop (DVI output via DVI-to-HDMI cable) to the HDMI 2.  I have my video card to output at 1920x1080, the same setting I used for my Westinghouse.  FIRST IMPRESSION IS \"WOW ITS FUZZY\" AND IT DOES NOT FILL THE SCREEN.  THERE IS A BLACK BAND OF BOUT AN INCH ALL AROUND THE FULL SIZE WINDOW !!  Ok, it needs to be tweaked.  So I selected \"Standard\" mode BUT much to my surprise some settings were \"greyed out\" and not accessible.  I can't change the \"sharpness\" setting for use as a computer monitor through either  the HDMI 2 or the PC input using the VGA cable!!  ITS STUCK AT 50 IN THE RANGE OF 0 to 100 AND CAN'T BE ADJUSTED !!!  I NEED TO SET IT TO 100.-->> SINGLE LINE COLOR FOR CAD SOFTWARE IS IMPROPERLY DISPLAYED -  AutoCad using 256 color palette displayed on a black backgroud displays wrong color vertically and diagonally.  The correct color is displayed only when its perfectly horizontal.  The way my AutoCad is set up, plotted line width is dependant on the color.  EACH OF MY MAIN COLOR HAS 3 DIFFERENT SHADES DENOTING 3 DIFFERENT LINE WITDH OR SCREENING WHEN PLOTTED.  THESE SHADES ARE NOT DISTINGUISHABLE. This may be a problem of vertical and horizontal sync frequency BUT THERE ARE NO ADJUSTMENTS AVAILABLE to correct the problem.  I've tried everything on the video card but can't get rid of this problem.  I'm going to contact Samsung for a specific driver for the 650 series LCD (IF THEY HAVE ONE) to see if that would fix it.  The TV is recieving 1920x1080 but does not fill the screen.  It measures about 43\" viewable area.-->> FONTS IN INTERNET PAGES AND WORD PROCESSOR IS FUZZY :  I thought it was just a problem with AutoCad but ALL software windows displayed as \"graphics\" is fuzzy.  The only thing that looks DECENT are photos and 3D renderings.CONCLUSION :This TV IS SUPERB, as a TV . . .  no questions about that.  But . . .  IT FAILS MISERABLY AS A COMPUTER MONITOR.  My inferior Westinghouse runs circles around this Samsung when used as a COMPUTER MONITOR.  It might be the combination of my video card and this TV, but I doubt it.  If you intend to use this TV as a computer monitor more than ocaisionally, YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED.With my old Westinghouse,  I just plugged in the DVI out from my computer and it displayed the image full screen with accurate color.  A little tweak on \"brightness\", \"contrast\", \"backlight\" and \"hue\" and it looked just as sharp as my LCD monitor on my laptop. . . NO MATTER WHAT SOFTWARE I RAN.I had expected THIS SAMSUNG TV to be at least equal to the Westinghouse as a computer monitor.  I WAS WRONG AND DISAPPOINTED.  Take your laptop to a local store and try it out  FIRST. . .  then buy from Amazon at a better price.
