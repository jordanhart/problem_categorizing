They have it on sale for 770 dollars.  I read some reviews that said the glare problem was a deal breaker.  So i go and buy a 55 inch Coby LED and when i get home the picture looked too redish and the sound was awful.  I took back my Coby and exchanged for this LG 60 inch.  Probably one of the best decisions i ever made.  I have alot of sunlight in my living room and this thing rocks.  Its the best tv i ever bought.", "Date": "January 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "nothing but the best", "Author": "Robert A.

However, it is the same TV and wow you really can tell the difference between the upgrade from a 42\" to 60\". It's a bit heavier than I would have imagined but then again the screen size is much bigger than i could comprehend from the display models.easy to use functions on the remote and the remote itself is easy and no hard button pushing like i had to with my other LG remote.A little disappointed that two of the three HDMI inputs are on the side of the tv and not on the back panel.All in all, for 800, this is a great deal, so glad i pulled the trigger on it... now to watch something like LOTR or Aliens on it.Primary use is for Xbox and PC. Surprising enough it isn't too bad for a large monitor, though be warned, there isn't a good fit for screen resolution that i could find without it being under 1600 and bulky. I think im currently setup on 1680x768 and its alright but about .5 inch of the toolbars and windows when maximized are cut off so some blind clicking may occur.Update: Found out recently and had thought I could do this but change the scaling on my graphics card by going to the nvidia GPU control panel so that it would fit the screen better. It isn't perfect but at least i can now see all boarders of my windows. This is on my PC of course. I dont plan to use my tv moving forward but due to space constrictions in my location, its the only thing i can currently use.", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Picture and Value - Poor Sound", "Author": "Professor", "ReviewID": "R9O0QGPIJIRPO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice looking and functioning television, easy to set up. Wonderful sharp picture as good or better than LED/LCD. This is good for a room that has less light and glare, but will show well in either. The only negative that gave this a 4-star was the sound quality. In a small room you will be fine, larger rooms will require a sound-bar or surround sound to give you a full sound effectiveness.

The picture is superb and I haven't even tried a full 1080p bluray..this is just from watching hd cable in 720p! I spent weeks researching televisions, and when I would go to stores, every single customer service rep would give me the same line about how led was better (for gaming and sports), and plasmas have burn in and more power consumption (how do they even sale plasmas). After a ton of research, I found out the burn in problem has been addressed and plasmas are actually better for gaming and sports...due to the 600hz refresh rates. Power consumption wise on a new plasma is around $15 more a year! Superb Picture quality, and no picture loss regardless of angle....PRICELESS! Only thing I noticed was when the cable guy came he gave me this crap about component cables being better then hdmi (for 720p) (I think he just didn't have a hdmi). I tried the components but the picture looked really grainy and had a greenish tint that I couldn't seem to fix. I started thinking that something was wrong with the tv, but decided to try a hdmi, and waaalaaa...can't stop smiling since :)...So if anyone is using components and aren't happy with the picture...try using hdmi....BIG difference with this tv! You absolutely cant beat this picture for under $1000.00! Period! The surprising thing to me is that, none of the reps that work in the television departments seem to know what they are talking about and people go in and take their word because they work there, and are just being misinformed. However the one thing that does hold true is the glare problem...if you have a bright room you might think about curtains with a plasma. It's not that bad but once you have such a excellent picture it seems like every little thing that takes away from that becomes a bother! Do your own research though...and be warned...it's amazing how many people in forums are misinforming people also...just because they have an led, and over half of them probably never even owned a plasma or took the time to look at the new plasmas! I myself had dismissed plasma before I started shopping and was 100% looking for a led, but I am now a believer!", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Bomb!!", "Author": "mjaytee", "ReviewID": "R1878R7UBV65DU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having the great LG 50PA6500 50-inch 1080p 600 Hz Plasma HDTV it invariably \"shrunk\" over time and I lusted for a 60\".  I go to HHGregg to see what was available at the time and to see if I could haggle a similar price to Amazon's which at the time had the LG 60PA6500 60-Inch 1080p 600Hz Plasma HDTV for $828 as a \"like new\" warehouse deal.  They had the 60PA6500, but the salesman instead offered the 60PA5500 (negligible differences) for $785 tax included.  I should have jumped at that deal, but I really didn't \"need\" a new TV, so I used every ounce of willpower to walk out of the store.  Well, my last old school TV died, so that was my excuse to look again.  I go back to HHGregg and this TV is on sale for $799.99, more than the price I was offered before but still a good deal.  But also, a lot cheaper than any other 60\" in the store.  I got it this time for $830 total using the store card, could not get them to budge this go round.Like the LG 50PA6500 the picture is excellent out the box.  I intend to calibrate it eventually like I did my 50\", which made it even better.  But for those not so picky, the stock setting is just fine once you take it out of the energy saving settings.  I see that the 2013 version takes away a hdmi input, so I am glad I was able to get a hold of this one.*******************************************************************************************Update 4-4-2013Well, I did a calibration using the lead reviewer of the PA6500 and my own tweaks and the picture is even better, as expected.  I'm a semi-green guy, meaning I'm not totally anal about energy conservation, but I am somewhat conscientious about it.  So unlike many, I use the energy saving \"Intelligent Sensor\" mode.  I have to say that I like it.  Bright during the day, but dims at night when a bright screen wears on my eyes over time.  The only time is appears too dim to me is while watching a basketball game, then I turn it off, otherwise it is satisfactory.In the end, I truly believe that the LG PA5500/6500 will go in the annals as one of the best bang for the buck TVs of all time.  Especially, if one was able to get one of the absolute great deals this TV was going for sometimes.  I have seen people say they were able to get one for under $700 total.", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "great tv", "Author": "ian", "ReviewID": "R2TI9S21C1TIVM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wonderfull tv. great contrast, bright color, huge! came quickly once we ordered it. a little bit of glare, but turn off the lights and it looks great.", "Date": "March 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wow!", "Author": "Mark R.

Did not want the smart or 3D capability, as I have read 3D doesn't work very well and we have Rokus that give many more channels than the built-in streaming options (MLBTV, for one).  Beyonce's half-time show was incredible on this screen.  After watching this for a while, all other TVs pale, miserably, in comparison.  Watched Airport '79 (HD), downloaded from Amazon, and I felt like I was in a movie theater.  The only drawback is it's so big, it does not fit very well in our family room.  A lot of people return their HDTVs because they are disappointed with the picture - you must have HD content to see the potential of HDTV (Blu Ray, HD Broadcast, etc.), and that can be difficult to get.

I did my research and preferred plasma.This set came washed out and grainy (to my taste) from the manufacturer because it was on ENERGY-saving mode and LIGHT-sensor adjustment (pretty cool to see how the brightness level adjusts on its own as the ambient light is adjusted). But after some tweaking and research...woowww! What a magnificent change to my video enjoyment! Even the Matrix in DVD format was stunning already, let alone Avatar or Pixar cartoons. The contrast between dark and light in movie scenes was just out there, compared to my old 42\" Vizio 1080p LCD 120Hz. Smooth motion pictures with vivid details. No need to adjust audio/video sync since it's a faster subfield (600Hz). Speakers suck as with most flat panels these days. No surprise there. Reflection is present, but we usually watch TV with the curtains pulled or at night time with low lighting. Nevertheless, if you're up for a stunning HDTV experience, consider this one!If you're gonna watch mostly non-digital stuff (anything less than 720p resolution), I'd suggest you research for an LED LCD TV from a reputable brand. Maybe it's not a good time to buy plasma for non-digital signals yet but wait a little longer for prices to go down or programming to be more available. This TV does not produce a 'pleasing' picture when viewing non-digital signals. I also have a Samsung LED LCD from 2012 and can say that it is better than this LG plasma in non-digital, although the best is CRT for viewing non-digital signals because of little to no pixelation and smoother image transitions. But once you have digital media playing on it, you are in for a smooth, detailed motion picture.Worth the price considering the size of the screen, technology, and color reproduction.", "Date": "February 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT BUY", "Author": "PatMatt \"Pat Schrawder\"", "ReviewID": "R1Q2SQM8TE3FVC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I REASEARCHED A LOT OF FLAT SCREENS BEFORE BUYING THIS ONE.

I am extremely disappointed. The setup for color and picture characteristics can be highly complex, and this TV has more adjustment options than I have ever seen. And none of them are described in the manual.

Perhaps there is a manual hidden somewhere on the internet - and I hope that I find it soon! Correction: There is a \"Wizard\" in the color adjustment process. I used it and messed up all of the reasonable adjustment that I had done so far. I will update this if I find a better process/method for color adjustment.Update: I have had the TV for about a month now.
