It is very slim and lightweight so it doesn't weigh down my entertainment center. So far, I used it for my PS3, Blu-ray player, and PS4 and the picture looks sharp on all my HD devices, with 720p. It automatically adjusts the settings based on the light. The volume is great; I usually have it set to 20 (out of 63). Overall, I'd recommend it to others.This is my third Sanyo and I think I have become a loyalist of sorts. Amazing products from a quality brand!", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Sanyo 32\" Class LCD 720p 60Hz HDTV | DP32642", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/410RjWrdJSL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008BQGGRQ"}}
