Don't hesitate to get your hands on one!", "Author": "Matthew Louis Dufrene", "ReviewID": "R1EML19AKQ91IP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have spent looks of time researching which tv would be the best option for me.  I was previously looking at the Samsung PN58C7000 which is basically the next step up in the line.  When I came across this option I was skeptical at first due to the limited information and customer reviews out there.  It isn't even on Samsungs site yet.  After some deep research and consideration I decided to make the jump and purchase this model.  I must say that I think I made the right decision.  Not only is this model hundreds cheaper than the C7000 and C8000, but after some tweaking you can actually unlock the tv to think it is the C8000.  It is as simple as hitting a few buttons.  You can search how to do this on AVS fourms.  The main difference between this model and the C8000 is the Real Black filter, but to be honest the blacks this display shows are pretty outstanding.  The 3D is also fantastic.  I for one can't wait until some more 3D blu-ray's come out. As a side note, if you convert to C8000 you will have to switch back to C680 before watching a 3D movie. It is quick to do and your settings are saved.  Below I will post some of the settings I am currently using for day time and night time.

After attempting to be a conscientious consumer and read 30 hours of HDTV reviews, I took the plunge when this sold for under $1600 with a 3D starter kit.Note to new HDTV buyers:1) The advantage and glory of having a over 50\" screen is under appreciated. Buy as big as your room will allow, you will have the TV a long long time.2) Dont read \"too much\" on AVSforum.  You will begin to learn to \"watch for\" things in TV performance that for the common man, just detracts.3) Adjustments and \"black levels.\" Sheesh, this TV is so grand right out of the box.  I'm a techie and haven't even delved into such matters, I was so excited to get the PS3 gaming action going, I haven't cared since.  If the image looks good, or even fine, just leave it alone, you'll never know!I have no buyer's remorse and I'm completely 100% happy that I got this enormously sized 3DTV. Every single soul that has stepped into our home has been awed.  Sitting 9 feet away from a 58 incher, wow.  For the first couple hours, I thought maybe, just maybe I should have gotten smaller.  As far as game playing and movie watching, the immersion level is top notch.  I could see where this would be overkill for granny just watching the news, but then granny would appreciate how lifelike the anchorman is and how legible ALL words are.Ok, enough about the size.Let me hit some points:Buzzing:  -People need to chill the freak out about this. A 58 inch screen means you MUST sit a certain distance to see the screen without actually seeing the pixels.  That is 6.5 feet for this screen.  I don't hear a faint buzzing until I'm within 2 feet, and I have EXCELLENT hearing.Remote:  -The remote is back-lit; the volume and channel buttons are large.  That's about the only positive of the remote.On-screen Menu:  -The menu is bad on several points. Some of the settings that should be quicker to get to ARE NOT.  Oh no! better buy a different tv! *sarcasm.I think most my menu griefs would be solved by a universal remote, like the Game function.  -Anytime the input button is pressed, there is a \"PC\" option annoyingly right below \"TV\", whereas it should be grayed itFavorites:  -This option on the remote just cycles through the saved channels, unlike my Sony 32\" that brings up a list I can scroll through, which I prefer.2D to 3D Conversion:  -I didn't even know the TV did this!  It was a surprise feature for me.  I knew other 3DTVs had this function as I read in my research.  It also lets you set the \"depth\".  Try to just enjoy this feature as-is.  If you start to mess with the depth, you'll notice ghosting.  I have not tried actual 3D content so I can't attest to ghosting on real 3D.24p Playback:  -I'm having difficulty with this.  My PS3 is set for 24p as is the TV, but 24p content seems juttery, which I don't like.  I've got to tinker with it", "Date": "February 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bad Horizontal Line Bleeding UPDATE: DO NOT BUY", "Author": "incende", "ReviewID": "R1O6R71WGVU2YX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Update 1/8/2013:  Samsung eventually replaced this model with a PN59D7000 in the summer of 2011.  About 2 months ago the replacement TV started to develop these pink blobs on two portions of the screen.  The pink blobs ran vertically from the top of the screen to the bottom and were about a 1/3 of the way from the right and left sides of the panel.  I called Samsung on 12/30 to see about what was the problem and they said it was still under warranty and that I would hear back from someone within 48 hours.  Well today I received and email from Samsung saying my transaction ticket had been closed.  So I called back and after a little back and forth with the service rep he tells me that the transaction was cancelled because the TV was out of warranty.  So now I have $1500 paper weight that I'll have to replace.  DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG.  THEY DO NOT BACK UP THEIR PRODUCTS.  A $1500 television should last for more that a year and half.I purchased this plasma after carefully considering the pros and cons of plasma technology.  I liked the features that the plasmas offered, along with the nice blacks, all at a cost lower than LCDs on the market.  Personally, I have had many LCD monitors/TVs in the past and only three of them were without dead pixels and all three of those were Samsungs.  So, I when one of Amazon's competitor had a deal on this TV, I called Amazon and asked them to price match, which they did, and I had this TV shipped to my house.The service I received from Amazon was very good, they price matched this TV to a very low price.  When I had problems with the local shipping company who handled the delivery, Amazon also reimbursed me for having to pick the TV up from them myself.  As always, A++ service from Amazon.However, the TV itself has had constant problems.  The first problem was a buzzing noise coming from the back of the panel.  This was within the first 30 days I owned the TV, and I should've sent it back then, but I called Samsung who sent out a technician.  The buzz coming from the TV was extremely annoying and was highly directional.  If you sit in one area of my living room you cannot help but hear the noise, and personally, after a period of an hour or so, the noise starts to make me feel nauseous.  The tech listened to the noise and at first claimed he couldn't hear it, however when I directed him to this certain area, he admitted he could hear it but explained that the noise was within specs and there was nothing he could do.  We discovered that if you placed something directly behind the TV, like a pillow or blanket, it would absorb most of the noise.  I also discovered that I could vary the distance between the TV and the wall and it would affect where you could hear the noise in the room.  So, the solution to this problem was to pull the TV about a 1 and 1/2 feet away from the wall so that the noisy area fell somewhere in front of the my couch.  I decided I could live this and decided to keep the TV.The second problem is the horizontal line bleeding on this unit that occurs when there is a black object on a white background.  There are examples on the AVS Forums of the bleeding I am describing.  It is very obvious in sources that have static backgrounds, like when using a computer, Xbox360 menus, PS3 load screens, and cartoons.  I again called Samsung about the issue and they sent out the same technician from my previous issue.  He arrived and first tried to adjust all the picture and processing options like Dynamic Contrast in an attempt to get rid of the bleeding, none of which changed anything.  Next he took the back off of the TV and tried to adjust the voltages, which again did nothing.  He explained he had never seen the problem and started taking pictures and video of the bleeding, which he emailed to Samsung.  He told me that since the bleeding issue was occurring on every source including the service menu, the only thing he could do is replace the panel.  He told me he would let me know within a week when the panel would be shipped.Well skip ahead 3 weeks later and after many calls to Samsung ECS, they are finally shipping out a panel that should be here next week.  Samsung ECS has offered to refund me the price of the television, but since I had it price-matched I don't believe I could find a similar TV for the same price.  So I am hoping the new panel will fix the issue.I will update once the panel has been replaced.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great 3D but there is a Buzz", "Author": "Colin", "ReviewID": "R30PGJ1WEQTJL7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV (not from Amazon) as an upgrade from a Samsung 56\" LED DLP I've had for about 3 years.  I was interested in upgrading mainly because of the 3D technology and this TV seemed to have everything I was looking for including a reasonable price.2D - The 2D picture on this set is about as good as it gets.  Sports, games, almost anything looks great.  The colors and contrast do not dissappoint.  Basically one of the best screens you can buy for home viewing.3D - As for the 3D I am quite impressed.  I bought my TV with the Samsung Shrek starter kit.  The glasses that came in this kit appear to be somewhat fragile but work well.  I have not had any sync issues as other have mentioned.  The TV sends out a sync signal to the glasses constantly when 3D is being display.  When the TV goes to 2D or is turned off the glasses know to turn themselves off since they quit receiving the sync signal.  I have tried Gran Turismo 5 and Wipeout HD for PS3 and Black Ops for XBox 360.  GT5's level of 3D is okay but I was expecting more depth.  Wipeout HD was recently updated to 3D so if you have this game you may want to run it again and get the update to 3D.  Wipeout is really quite amazing and probably the best looking game so far in 3D.  Black Ops on XBox 360 is a hit or miss for me (more miss than hit apparently).  The 3D effect is good but it appears to be really hard to focus and aim on your enemies.  I notice that my ability to kill people in 3D is hindered significantly than 2D.  I think the jury is still out on whether 3D is good for first person shooters or not.  The TV's ability to up convert 2D to 3D is far from perfect but is still a pretty neat feature.  Overall the 3D is nice but due to the flickering effects and possible eye strain I think myself and most other viewers will be using 3D 10% of the time or less.  One thing to keep in mind is that a number of the older theater receivers with HDMI switching may not be able to pass a 3D signal.  I had an Onkyo TX-SR605 and had to upgrade to a TX-SR608 (highly recommend this receiver).  As for HDMI cables I think almost any will pass a 3D signal (contrary to what you might hear) because the ones I bought 4 years ago seem to be working just fine.Concerns - A couple of concerns I have found so far is the glare from the screen and the buzzing noise (these two items are supposed to be typical of plasmas).  This is my first plasma and the glare doesn't bother me much but it is alot more noticeable than my DLP or LCD ever were.  If you have a bright window or light source opposite where the TV is placed I really would not recommend this TV.  The buzzing on the TV I recieved is noticeable even from the couch (8 ft in front of TV).  It is not noticeable if there is audio going from the media source but if the room is quite I can turn on and off the TV from the couch and hear the buzzing go on and off.  Samsung service is very accommodating and agreed to send out a repair company to evaluate the noise.  I am unsure what amount of buzz is acceptable at this point but why not have it looked at.Other Notes - The menu and remote are very nicely laid out and user friendly.  The TV also has pixel shifting and a scrolling routine in the menus which gradually transitions from black to white to help wash out any image retention.  I really don't think burn-in from gaming will be a problem with this TV unless you are playing 16 hours a day.  I didn't like the look of the stand in many of the images shown on the web but in person it actually looks very nice an contemporary.", "Date": "January 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "I've enjoyed owning this television.", "Author": "N.

I found this one refurbished for just over $1000 here at Amazon and couldn't resist, especially after reading all of the positive reviews.It shipped in perfect shape and was a marvel to behold when we took it out of the box. Setup was very easy. There are already a lot of reviews here that talk about the technical spec's and such, so I'll just weigh in on the quality of the picture and 3D. At first it wasn't so hot - flesh tones were a bit red and all other colors were just a bit off. I checked some tv/video forums and found others with the same tv and I copied their calibration settings (which are very easy to change). Huge difference. I have never seen a clearer picture on a tv. The HD stations that I get through my cable provider are a real pleasure to watch.When I turn on my Samsung Blu-Ray player, the input source on the tv automatically switches to dvd. One of the \"smart\" parts of this smart tv.I've streamed 3D movies from vudu.com and bought a few 3D dvd's as well. In every case, the 3D quality was fantastic. If you can get this set for less than $1,500 I would say you're nuts not to buy it.

Could not be happier. The reviews on this board convincedme that it was not only a great deal but a great Tv. I have a 50 inch Samsung Plasma for 5 yearsthat I wanted to upgrade and this was it. The price is unbelievable for this size, no apps isprobably why, but I don't need that with an existing computer.I have no buzzing sound as I had on my 50 inch. The only adjustment I made was increasingthe Cell Light from 10 to 14.My friend has a new 55 inch Samsung LED which I watched several times, to me LED is too bright andemits a phony picture. At this writing I believe Plasmas are the best.The only negative so far is the bright and shiny silver stand needs to go, it distracts from lookingat the screen at times. But I am getting a Z-Line stand, that floats the Tv, and detaching this one.These look to be going away, at this time Beach Camera has eight left for $1597.00, I paid $100 extraon their site for the 3D starter kit and also purchased the three year extended warranty.  My 50 inchafter 13 months developed green dots on the screen and I had to pay a service tech to come out and fix,which he did, that problem you see a lot on plasmas at bars, increasing the VOLTAGE fixes it.This was easy to set up, Plug in to wall, connect cable from the wall to the cable box,, and the HDMIcable from the cable box to the TV.", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Randy", "ReviewID": "R1WO7K28FRC73W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is great.

First I'd like to say that compared to my last TV, there is not a substantial enough glare to complain about. In my last TV, my wife and I could wave at each other in the reflection and now we can hardly see anything. The lamp behind us is barely discernable. There is no buzz what-so-ever and the audio is acceptable for being a TV. I don't have surround sound yet but I plan on it but I am in no hurry due to the TV'S competence. The 3d is fabulous and the 2d to 3d convergence is acceptable. The picture is awesome for being out of the box and I can only imagine what it'd be like ounce it is calibrated.

There's a bit of distortion in sports content when the players are small and moving quickly, but overall, it's a great picture.The problem is, the screen is way too reflective. I know plasmas tend to be reflective, but this is beyond that. I can clearly see the reflection of stainless steel appliances 20 feet behind the TV even when it not very bright outside, or when we have a moderate amount of lighting in the room at night. Actually lights and windows are even worse. These reflection dominate dark scenes and even moderately bright scenes. So if you want this TV for a room that has any windows, or of you entertain a lot and will have the room lit while watching, I don't recommend this TV.
