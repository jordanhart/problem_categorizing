It arrived shortly after I ordered in execellent condition, even though it could have been packaged a little better.  The features are better than I expected with high definition on a number of channels that are automatic. I read all the reviews on this television and decided this was the best one could buy.  It is a lot better than my Akai television that lasted all of three years.", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "32\" Class (31.5\" diagonal)Viewing Angle 178\u00b0Aspect Ratio 16:9Native Resolution (Number of Pixels) 1,049,088 (1,366 x 768)Contrast (Dynamic) 20,000:1\nProgressive Scan BacklightIPS Panel: A beautiful image from almost any angle\nIt has a Game ModeENERGY STAR Qualified\nRemote control replacement model # N2QAYB000485\nVIERA Link\u2122: Control multiple compatible devices with one remote", "Name": "Panasonic TC-32LX24 32\" Class Viera X24 Series 720p LCD HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41PaEyv3NLL.jpg", "ProductID": "B003Y802CQ"}}
