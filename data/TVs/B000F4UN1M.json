Both Sharps are the same size (20\") LCDs,but different models,they're great.The viewing angle is hard to beat.", "Date": "May 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great sound and viewing angle", "Author": "Declan Mantis", "ReviewID": "R1KFZWKB2D4WQ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product is excellent value for the money. Many 20\" LCD tv's have grossly inadequate sound, requiring you to hook them into an audio system. This tv can be comfortably seen by anyone at several angles in a 25' by 40' room, and needs no auxilliary sound system. I love this product.", "Date": "June 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "A great TV", "Author": "T. Kendall", "ReviewID": "R3SMQZLK0GZDDB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use this in a bedroom.  It is sharp and very reliable.  I particularly like the fact that it automatically shows closed captioning when you mute the sound so you can still see what is being said.  It also has a great feature to allow the sound to play and turn off the picture.  That is great for the music channels on cable.  Highly recommended", "Date": "March 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "Superb quality and performance", "Author": "Mtnwmn", "ReviewID": "RS2RXR25KOQCK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV delivers a very sharp picture with crisp colors. It's a great size for an office or small room; mine is mounted with a swing arm on the wall. The only minor quibble is the power and video cords are black so they are very obvious -- would be nicer if they were white.", "Date": "February 2, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "20-inch LCD TV for smaller rooms or installing in kitchen; includes stand\nEDTV picture resolution displays all signals at 480p; 4:3 screen aspect ratio\n640 x 480-pixel resolution, 450 cd/m2 brightness, 500:1 contrast ratio, 170-degree viewing angle\nInputs: 2 composite, 1 S-Video, 1 component\nTwo stereo speakers, 2.1 watts apiece (4.2 watts total)", "Name": "Sharp Aquos LC20S5U 20-Inch LCD EDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41H6JRS1C5L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000F4UN1M"}}
