I had the TV up and running in about 15 minuets after its arrival at my door. Netflix is much better than it is on my xbox and loads quickly even with my slower DSL connection. I have not tried the 3D settings yet, but 2D looks great. I also have it hooked up to my surround sound and so I have no idea what the TV audio actually sounds like. I'm sure it isn't any better than any other flat screen TV.Here are the settings I used for picture quality:Start in Movie mode and change these settings:Color Temperature:Red Gain: 84Green Gain: 90Blue Gain: 100Red Offset: 110Green Offset: 100Blue Offset: 100Advanced Picture:Color Enhancement: Rich ColorAdaptive Luma: StrongFilm Mode: OffSmart Dimming: OffAmbient Light Sensor: OffThe only other change I made was to increase the backlight from 55 to 65. This just causes a brighter or darker screen. These settings take care of the yellow tint that the TV starts with and makes pictures look great. If you want it darker or lighter you can cut the color temps in half or increase them by the same ratio in order to keep quality colors as well.", "Date": "January 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "VIZIO E420d-A0 - Best Vizio 3d 42\" Tv", "Author": "mb8873", "ReviewID": "R3OKVDS45NGDG8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow. I am totally blown away by this 500$ 3D Led flat screen Vizio tv. It has exceeded all my expectations. JD Power and Assoc calls Vizio the gold standard in flat screen affordable tv's and now I can totally see why. Vizio makes another 42 inch LCD 3d tv which also from what I have seen is a great set as well but I have to say this model is the better of the two. The LED which to me outshines the Lcd model and 2 million contrast ratio ( the other has 200,000) make this 120htz tv really pop. The color and clarity will really shock you too. I have seen alot of great tv's, my family owns all the hi end 2500$ tv's including a couple of 3d's and this tv can hang with them all. The 3D is so rich and clear and the black levels are the best out of any tv ive owned (my previous set was a sony 42\" Bravia 1080 60htz flat screen for 800$). I did alot of reading before I bought a new 3d tv and really didnt feel like spending a 1000$ to get what i wanted and I have to say I am one happy guy and so will you be. The one thing you hear alot of negative reviews on is usually the audio , not on this set it is outstanding. I purchased a soundbar when I ordered the tv because of the ongoing sound issues with flat screens but when i connected the tv the quality srs surround sound that came out of this 3.5 inch thick 30lb tv blew my mind. When i eventually hook up the sound bar it will only be that added bonus but the set does not require it as most models in its class absolutely do. I am watching green lantern in 3d as I write this review and i must say it was worth the research and waiting to purchase such an overacheiver!", "Date": "January 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "great product", "Author": "GeetarJake", "ReviewID": "R3MXQE1AKM7167", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The picture on this TV is amazingly good. 3d looks great, I've used it for watching blu rays, netflix, and playing ps3, and with a few little picture tweaks you can really get a great image. There's no motion blurring at all, and the contrast is just awesome.My ONLY complaint is that the manual says to use an 8M 1.0 pitch 20mm screw to install the set onto a wall mount, however, after several trips to the hardware store, multiple conversations with Vizio Support(who also gave me those same screw specs) and some trial and error, I discovered that it's actually supposed to be 1.25 pitch. That would have saved me a few bucks, and lots of time and looking like a jackass going to the local hardware store half a dozen times buying different screws.

Received Friday, May 31, 2013.On Amazon this TV seems to have great reviews so I purchased it a few days ago.  This was to go into a bedroom mainly for Netflix use.When I received it I immediately started to get it set up.  I hard-wired it to my router, plugged in an HDMI cable from my cable box to the TV, plugged in the power.  After the initial setup, I tried to use the Netflix app - no option for \"Yes, I have a Netflix Account\", just \"Unable to connect to the Netflix service - Try again or Exit\".I tried the YouTube app and it worked fine.I reset the TV to factory defaults (Menu > Help > Delete Memory (Factory Restore)), but this didn't help.  In fact I tried this twice over the next 12 hours.After a search of the problem it seems Vizio has a lot of problems with Netflix.  Even if your TV works fine now, a future update (that you have no control over) may bork Netflix or other services until a new patch is released.  This can be weeks or even months in some cases I found online.I called Vizio support this morning (Saturday, June 1, 2013) and the guy gave me 2 different and unrelated reasons Netflix won't work properly.  He had me factory reset the TV a third time and still no luck.  He said it was probably a problem with my router or that Netflix was down.  I told him both my Roku and PC can view Netflix just fine yesterday and this morning and that the TV could stream HD YouTube videos just fine.  Then he said it might be a bandwidth issue.  I said the last speed test I did showed 52 mb/s down and 6 mb/s up.  That couldn't be the problem.He then asked me to plug the TV directly into my modem and let it sit over the weekend.  What??  I said I use my internet connection for work and that wasn't an option, but I reminded him that it is wired (not wireless) into the router and it CAN connect to other online services.  He then told me to send it in to Vizio (on my dime) for warranty repair.No thanks.  I told him I would just return it to Amazon and get a different brand.  This was my first experience with Vizio.  I'll stick with Samsung, LG, and Panasonic.I called Amazon right after.  The tech at Amazon had me try a few things and eventually said its faulty and he set up a return.  UPS will be out to pick it up on Monday.  Amazon is awesome!All that said, this TV DOES have a nice picture out of the box.  Tweaking it using the settings that another reviewer posted here just makes it better.  The picture looks just as good my LG LCD and almost as good as my Panasonic plasma.If you are looking for a TV with the convenience of apps, look at another brand.  If you think this is a good price for an LCD and don't need the apps, this might be a good buy for you - again, the picture is great with an HD source.** UPDATE June 05, 2013 **I ordered a Samsung UN40EH5300 the day I setup the return for this Vizio.  I received the Samsung yesterday (arrived in one day with free shipping) and everything works great out of the box.  A couple of setting tweaks and the Samsung has an outstanding picture.  I will leave a review for the Samsung after I've had it for a while and follow up with any problems if I encounter them.", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing picture.

The 3D on this TV on the other hand is probably the worst I have ever seen. You pay an extra $20 for this version over the non 3D version and believe me you get what pay for. I also have a 47\" LG Cinema 3D LED TV as well and it is half the thickness of this one with much better 3D and I only paid $650 for that one at Walmart because it is not a smart TV. The apps on this TV are okay the Netflix and VUDU work great but the amazon instant video is worthless if you have prime because it is hard to find the free movies.  It also has M-go which is completely useless if you have an amazon or VUDU account. There about 80 other apps (music, movies, news, social, sports, and games) but I don't have a use for any of them on my TV.(if you are looking for a good smart TV go with LG or Samsung they are the best). if you are looking for a LED TV with great picture for a great price than I recommend this one; however, if you do not already own a 3D TV do no make this one your first one. Plus all video and audio settings must be adjusted for each input plus 3D mode and for any smart TV video apps.

Unboxing and setting up is easy enough.  Power on and follow the screens... the first thing you're prompted to do is connect the wifi.  It took 3 very smart friends, 2 hours, and 1 lengthy call to tech support to get it connected. It seems the TV only responds to super simple passwords... so we had to reset my wireless router back to factory defaults and configure from scratch to get the TV to accept the password.  More trouble than I've had from most devices.That said, Tech Support was very helpful and a pleasure to work with.  Once connected though, I find the built in apps are pretty much worthless.  The Amazon and Netflix apps are tedious to navigate.  To use the Hulu app, you need to subscribe to HuluPlus.  There's no Pandora, no YouTube.  There are a bunch of Yahoo apps that are a decade past their prime.  I don't recognize, or care about, any of the others.  Bottom line... I'll be hooking my laptop up via the HDMI and using that for web access, just like I did my non-smart TV.  So the Smart TV aspect of this box is worthless unless all you care about is streaming Amazon, Netflix or HuluPlus.. and you have the patience to click endlessly to navigate the interface. I have a USB wireless keyboard I'd like to use, but so far can't get it to work.  I think you're limited to using the remote for input.On the plus side... the image quality is awesome.  The styling is beautiful.  Sounds great.  Previews of some 3D movies are very promising... I think I'll love the 3D.  I did try the 2D to 3D function.. though I haven't figured out how to get it to work yet.  I'm thinking it will be more complicated, and less impressive, than it's worth to figure it out.I'd get this TV for the image quality and 3d alone.  The Smart functionality is just a small bonus.  I'm happy based on the price I paid.

Amazon price matched Dell's price of $508 so i got an Awesome price on an already inexpensive Tv.Pros: Great price, decent selection of apps, the remote has an Amazon instant video button(and a Netflix button). I tested the 3D function with Crysis 3 and was quite pleased. The 3D causes little to no eyestrain versus the active shutter type Tv's which can become very uncomfortable during a movie. The buttons make a very satisfying \"click\"(not a noise, you feel the button click) when pressed and have a very grippy rubberized finish(the remote itself is glossy plastic on the top, and matte plastic on the bottom.)Cons: Remote has very small buttons but can easily be used with one hand. For size reference, the remote is 5 3/4\" by 2\" or slightly skinnier but a little longer than an iPod touch. The apps are a little laggy. You have to wait a few seconds for the app bar to open, sometimes the apps freeze for a few seconds. The amazon instant app takes a long time to initially buffer(about a minute-vs 20 seconds on my computer), but it does not stutter at all while playing. I am running over Wifi, but all of my other devices are much faster when used in the same location as the Tv. The Tv has a yellow hue but Zachary's settings fixed that(they are a great starting point but i might tweak the settings a little). The glossy finish is a literal dust magnet, but now i have an incentive to clean more often.Even though the remote is tiny, it is still very usable but i wish the buttons were slightly taller(are wide and skinny. 4mm tall, 10 to 14 mm wide. The volume, channel, amazon, Netflix, and directional buttons are a little larger though.If you are still using Composite or component video, note that you can only have 1 type plugged in at a time since the jacks are shared between those two types.Finally, my Tv did have 1 stuck or dead pixel, but 1 in 2.7 million is a really small failure ratio, and it is only visible if you are within 2 feet of the screen.If you are on the fence about this, buy one, you won't regret it. The colors are rich and vibrant, the bezel is very slim(1/2\"), and the 3D works great. Why pay more for the same features?

The recent PBS Bocelli concert in Portofino was extremely enjoyable to watch. Wonderfully vivid detail.

I think this Vizio has great contrast and I like pretty much every channel that I subscribe to.  They all look good. Of course dvds look great too. They don't have to be blu rays. Blu Rays do look even more wonderful though.  I do want to mention that I bought another model for another room. It was the 40\" model with a different model number. It doesn't have 3d. I ended up taking it back because it didn't have the picture this model has. This set can be placed in a room with bright light and you can still see the details in the picture.

I purchased this TV mainly because I am in college and I had a pretty poor quality TV that didn't have HDMI capability. I am planning on purchasing a Playstation 4 which only outputs HDMI so an upgrade was necessary.The TV is beautiful. I didn't really know what 42 inches looks like, but it is definitely plenty big for my apartment. The few times I've used the 3D, I had good experiences. It can get a little blurry, however, so I'd give the 3D function a 7.5/10.I've never had a problem with the sound output and it definitely sounds good enough for me. I'd give it a 9/10.However, there is one big problem with my TV. It is especially noticeable when I am playing video games such as Grand Theft Auto or Fifa on PS3. Based on my research, it appears to be some sort of clouding/bleeding. In some areas of the TV, it is darker. It just doesn't look good. It is a big distraction when playing video games. Fortunately, I have a warranty and will get around to potentially getting a replacement.I will post back here when I get my replacement and see if my TV just shipped with it's own problems or if it's all models.Update:My TV was within the 90 day return policy and I have returned it for this Vizio 40 inch M series TV which I am much happier with. I think it has a better picture for sure and is thinner. I didn't use the 3D much because it wasn't super great, but I will miss it a little but the picture on my new TV is fantastic.

Turned off.The next day when I turn on the TV, I found that are several more apps being pushed to the TV, including Youtube and Skype. Youtube is easy to use, skype... totally unusable unless you buy the expensive Vizio webcam that is actually discontinued on VIZIO web site.I'm not a big 3D fan but I tested the 3D function with some youtube clips (search yt3d and you can find a bounch). It works ok. If you sit on the couch facing the TV, it feels like in movie theater. But if you stand in a bad angle you see double images.For the price I still think it's a good buy.

I've had one of these in my bedroom for some time, hooked up to an inexpensive sony 3d blueray/surround system.  In the bedroom the results were quite good.  We keep the intensity pretty low at night, but the few times we have bumped it up it seems very bright, I get almost direct sun near the TV in the morning and it overpowers that well.  Images are sharp and clear and when it works (see below) the 3d is really good.Since we have had it Netflix has done system upgrades a couple times and in two cases it took some time to see a firmware update on the TV to catch up.  it's always getting to the first Netflix screen that causes issues so I learned to simply move past it by returning to something previously viewed.  Works, but it's a bit quirky.The real issue with mine is that about 2 months after it I started using it with a couple HDMI devices, and then after a short time they quit working.  Since it was just sporadic use I didn't really notice, but then later I wanted to watch a blue ray and discovered that the HDMI port the sony was plugged into was also dead.  I am still using it as a TV and to watch Netflix in the bedroom, but there are no working HDMI inputs.  I've not had a piece of equipment fail in any of our systems (I have a couple large projector/theater rooms in the house and a couple large screen TV setups running with multiple device systems, so I think I know what I am doing.

First off, screen quality is good but not great.  Compared to a $400 Samsung 40\" 5000 series the picture quality was clearly better on the Samsung with much less adjustments needed.  That being said, with some adjustments the TV still looks good, just not great.  I had an older version of this same TV, E3D420VX, which unfortunately did not survive a recent move.  The only thing better about the older model was the remote, which had a full keyboard on the back and is much easier to use for the smart TV apps than the remote included with this TV.  Just like the old version though the user interface is somewhat sluggish in response and the remote has to be pointed directly at the TV to work.  The smart apps can also be a little sluggish or clunky to navigate, but I only ever use the amazon video app anyway and with my old qwerty remote I can search for stuff easily enough.  I definitely recommend either buying a universal remote that has a keypad or trying to find the one that came with the older Vizio model.  I've read some people have success with wireless USB keyboards but haven't tried that myself.3D on this unit is actually even a bit better than my old one.  I've got a few 3D digital movies and the depth seems just a touch better on this unit.  3D gaming has a ton of caveats.  I have an AMD 7950 so for 3D I'm limited to using an HDMI cable and its stuck at 24FPS.  That is noticeable for fast paced games that weren't designed for 3D.  But for games designed to support 3D, like Batman Arkum Asylum or Crysis 3, the 24 FPS limitation is significantly less noticeable.  And its simply freaking awesome.  I've used active shutter glasses in the past and noticed serious eye strain after more than 15 minutes of use.  With the passive tech from these glasses I experience no eye strain, none at all.  Some will point out you lose resolution, but honestly its hardly noticeable if even at all.  The immersion you get from the 3D totally outweighs the barely noticeable loss of resolution.Bottom line is that for games designed to support 3D, PC gaming with this TV is awesome (if you're video card is powerful enough).  I'd suggest for 1080p resolutions the 7950 or something in that class in bare minimum. For example I can run crysis 3 smooth as silk at high settings in 2D but if I want to turn on 3D I need to drop down to 1600x900 to stay smooth.  But I can run Batman Arkum Asylum at full settings @ 1080p in 3D and its smooth as a baby's butt.

I have had a 30in Vizio TV that has been a real gem for four years now so didn't hesitate to commit to Vizio again.  I'm glad I did.  The TV is just beautiful.  A very tiny (roughly 3/4\") trim surrounds the big, crisp, lovely screen and doesn't get in the way at all.  Easy to set up, out of the box to watching tv took all of 10 minutes to slap on the base and plug it in.

Out of the box the image is stunningly sharp if a little yellow.  I recommend using the settings from Zachary Dunklee in the reviews on this page for a good starting place.

I had a 26-inch VIZIO in my bedroom, and it had a great picture, but I often use closed captioning and the on-screen channel guide, and I simply couldn't read anything because the print was too small. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a second TV, but I needed something a lot bigger than a 26-inch, so I suspected that VIZIO was the way to go. It was definitely the right decision. The picture on this set is brighter and crisper than my SONY -- the quality is certainly as good as the SONY. The sound is better than the SONY. It weighs less than the 26-inch VIZIO, which is about 3 years old at this point. It was extremely easy to set up -- and I am NOT a technical person. The inconvenience of not having a QWERTY keyboard in order to do set-up is just that -- an inconvenience and nothing more because you won't need to do it again. The Netflix app is fantastic -- much easier to simply push a button than work your way through a Roku box procedure, which I have to do with my SONY. I had called VIZIO support for what turned out to be a problem with my cable box, and the woman at the support center was wonderful. She also registered my TV. Again, this is a second set, and my demands are few other than a great picture that allows me to read words and good sound; and the sound is much better than I would have ever expected. Because it was less than another $50 to upgrade to a 3-D \"smart\" TV, I did the upgrade, and it's well worth it, as I can access news from the internet and use the pre-installed Netflix and Amazon apps. There are 4 ports that allow me to hook up my cables from either the side or the back. I haven't tried watching anything in 3-D yet, so I can't comment on that, but the set did come with 2 pairs of glasses, and if I need extra glasses, I only need the cheap ones, not those expensive electronic glasses. I bought through the Amazon Warehouse -- just like I did with my SONY -- and buying \"like new\" meant that there was a VERY slight scraping on the original box! Quite frankly, with both of my TV Warehouse purchases, the boxes were in better condition than any box I've seen in a store! I wouldn't dream of buying a TV any other way, as the price is outstanding, and the service is great.Unless something goes terribly awry in the next few months (and I do expect that this TV should last me at least 5 years in order to maintain my 5-star rating), I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone. I've been a SONY advocate for more than 30 years, and the VIZIO is solid competition.", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing!!", "Author": "Luis Javier Mijares", "ReviewID": "R2KQHWAEG1ZJK0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my forst Vizio TV ever...

Having owned previous Vizio TVs I was a bit hesitant on purchasing this one. The early Vizio LCDs had poor picture quality and I was taking a risk on this one because I wanted to give 3D TV a shot and didn't want to spend too much money on it. This is on par with similar Samsung and Sony models that cost significantly more. I can play movies directly off a hard drive without any problems. The built in wifi and apps are excellent and the digital tuner works great with my Mohu leaf.I like the fact that it has passive 3D and the glasses don't cost much. The only thing I would change is having a QWERTY remote standard with it. Entering details during the initial set up was a drag when you have to select every letter using the arrow keys. Also a softer touch remote would be great. The buttons on this are a little stiff and noisy.Other than that minor flaw, I have to say that this is the best TV I've owned. So far only watched side-by-side 3D movies off a hard drive but will be getting a 3D Bluray player so that I can experience the true capabilities of this.I don't see the picture quality other reviewers are complaining about and the presets work fine for me.I have to say that Vizio really impressed me this time and I will not hesitate to purchase another TV through them.", "Date": "April 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Vizio TV", "Author": "Jeanne Alexandere", "ReviewID": "R3N1586R62VQE8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After twenty years with an \"old fashioned\" tv (I remember when there were only radios), I love our new vizio  Crisp color, high definition-you can't beat it.

I have not yet tested the 3D feature so can not comment about it.Comparing the prize + size + screen technology (LED) + Internet/Smart + 3D I think it is the best deal one could have...One thing which lack in this TV is the VGA port - It comes with limited ports (3HDMI and one Component).

Just take it back to your local Costco if you change your mind within 90 days.  This isn't a Costco ad but sounds like one! As to the televison we are very happy. We found the set-up of this TV to link our Amazon Prime account was quite easy. The internet access set up was as easy as selecting our wireless network on the set up screen and entering a couple of lines of information taken from our router label. We have viewed a Prime movie and it worked as expected. I don't have a wireless USB keyboard to test but the reviews lead me to believe the remote is the only input option.  The remote as an input device is clunky and somewhat tedious but it will eventually get the job done. We have older A/V equipment and the older TV we replaced had many more inputs/outputs.  It was a bit of a challenge to get all the goodies working together. I did have to buy some RCA jack splitters to allow the TV audio output to share an AUX input in to our home theater system with a turntable (no HDMI input option, that's how \"old\" my home theater is). I had to get the TV working in the home theater or we were stuck listening to Prime or web video through the TV speakers. Only my DVR had HDMI and that is a great system, one cable and you are done.  I jacked in my laptop using an HDMI cable and the TV displayed exactly as expected. The challenge on this TV is selecting the appropriate display settings.  This will take some study to understand and to adjust the settings to match our preferences.  The TV audio on it's own is so so, you can't expect much out the tiny speakers. Vizio knows most customers have home theater or will buy an accessory sound bar. Overall I love this, it replaces a 10year old Akai which weighed over 100 pounds and was working.  I dropped that off at Goodwill yesterday and the comment was \"that's what used to be called a TV\"! There is not much comparison to the old technology vs this new LED web enabled tech.

I was unaware when I bought this TV that Visio products are largely NOT DLNA compliant or certified yet. What this means to you as a customer is that you will be unable to stream video, pictures, or music from a local source on your home network via wireless. Samsung and Sony have done this for years and I guess I assumed since this was a wifi capable \"Smart\" TV, it would do it also. Now, if your looking for typical TV functionality, this TV may be just fine for you. But, why would you limit yourself if your going to make a fairly large investment in a TV that you would like to use for 5 years? For example, the reason Iphone and Android Smart phones are so popular, is the apps. Visio doesnt seem to think they are that important for TV's yet. I called and spoke to their management personally yesterday after trying to get PLEX or Twonky to work on a local network. Both Samsung and Sony not only support DLNA, but they also have their own way of allowing additional application integration.As I said, this TV might be great for you. My only advice about Visio is this is becoming an application centric world. As a consumer, you will be using more any more applications.

The 32\" just was a little to small. I was very happy with the picture of the 32\" and this is what drove me to buy the 42\". Even though the 32\" is not 3D, I thought that this gives me an opportunity to do a Vizio to Vizio comparison.First, I still love the picture for both of them. With adjustments mentioned and my fine tuning to my preference, the 42\" matched the 32\" in picture quality and clarity. I did not notice any bleed by the LED on both. The sound quality seemed comparable. The set up was easy for both and my Netflix and Amazon is easier to bring up on the 42\" than the 32\" with the dedicated buttons.So why did I give the 32\" a five star and the 42\" a four star...Motion blur. I don't know if it was on the 32\" and since it was a smaller TV, it was less noticable or not but it is noticable on the 42\". It is not something that drives me crazy or makes sports less enjoyable but it is there. I am not sure if there is anything I can adjust to make it less noticable or eliminate it. I am not a electronics whiz so I am hoping someone will post here something I can do to fix it. I would not consider it a deal breaker because of the positives including the price.

The Apps are nice, but the selection is REALLY limited; I basically only use Pandora, Accuweather, Netflix, maybe YouTube if I don't feel like whipping open the laptop, and the usual TV functions.Inputs are 2 HDMI, 1 component (RGB), Coax/RF/RG6 on the back, and one HDMI and a USB on the side (with an optical digital audio out).  If you own an older Wii, you will need a different cable to hook it up, there is no composite video jack (the yellow RCA jack). Same with the old-old-XBox, you'll need the component video cable.  Any newer system with HDMI is no issue.One pet-peeve:  The built-in TV speakers can be shut off through the menu, BUT will come back on when you turn the TV off and on again.  I need to get a hold of someone in tech support to try and fix that.  Also the digital audio out (optical) is ALWAYS ON when enabled through the menu (it can output PCM or Dolby), and muting the TV does NOT mute the digital audio, you have to mute the device receiving the audio.  Not ideal, but with the right universal remote, livable.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Quality is good OS is not!", "Author": "Sina", "ReviewID": "R38GWF4D1LT1G3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This TV has a good picture and sound quality so I have no complaints in this regard.

When I compared the audio, it was close enough for me to send the soundbar back.  If I need big sound, I bought a cheap little amplifier and run it through a set of old Bose speakers I had in storage.Very pleased except for two things, the LED backlighting isn't as uniform as I'd like and every so often I get vertical lines running along a fifth of the screen on the right.

Granted there aren't many cases I can compare this to since many of the other HDTVs I've seen have been equipped with sound bars or systems. I can say that the sound is better than the HDTV I had before this one.

Remember, in life you get what you pay for, while yes it says smart 120hz 3D TV, take it with a grain of salt.  This is still a great deal, but if you were to go toe to toe with a higher end TV (Samsung, Sony or Panasonic with true 120hz) you'll notice a slight difference, not large enough to justify the additional $2-300 spend.If you really want to experience the beauty of this picture and display, hook up a Blu-ray or find some true HD content on YouTube; it'll blow your mind how crisp this picture is.", "Date": "July 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unbeatable Price", "Author": "Lovestoshop777", "ReviewID": "RBBO39BTXNZ4G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, the 3D is amazing! I have a ps3, and ordered Avatar, Monsters Inc., and Ice Age Continental Drift in 3D with this TV. Wow! Avatar really is amazing on 3D. I need to purchase the active shutter glasses now. The regular theatre glasses that come with the TV are great, but the electronic glasses will fix the problem of having to be in front of the tv, which you would get with any 3D TV. One problem I did find, I put on the Blu Ray \"Rio\" movie, and you can see blur each time there is movement. This is disappointing, but the good thing is that it does not happen with all movies to where you notice it. I looked EVERYWHERE, and no place could compete with the price and features of this TV. I play Black Ops 2 on the ps3, and my Kill/Death ratio immediately improved. I used to use a 32\" Vizio, but this is much better than that one. I really loved the TV. I did not use any of the settings recommended by the other people. I preferred the Vivid setting with the sharpness lowered a little bit down to 10. Thats it.

Any help would be appreciated! also smart features work great comes equipped with YouTube which comes in awesome btw, I actually purchased the vizio remote control with a back keyboard for $12.99 highly recommend, you will not want to use the smart features without it and no set up needed, remote works right out of the box. I love the amazon app, scrolling through movie selections are a breeze!! Way better than selecting a movie through my ps3. Pandora is not equipped even though it is displayed in the product ad, you will have to use rhapsody and purchase a monthly sub but you do get a free 30 day trial. this television looks very sharp about half the weight and thickness of my last 42in vizio which is why I needed an upgrade after 5 years, very happy with my last vizio and they are a brand I trust! Selected the free 5-8 ship came 4 business days through ups in perfect condition. Set up was a breeze connected to wifi within seconds. Will be purchasing a couple new sets of glasses though the ones in the box are a little flimsy. My only legit negative comment is the sound don't expect movie theatre surround sound unless you purchase a sound box or home theatre system!

This Vizio is no where near as sharp as either my 3 year old Samsung LED/LCD TV or my 7 year old Sony LCD TV.  I've seen several posts with recommended picture settings in the reviews here but those didn't really make that much of a difference so I just went back to default (other than turning off the automatic dimming features as they totally suck on this TV.)  It's good enough for me to deal with in the bedroom because we don't watch TV in there a whole lot but overall I would say if you can afford it, buy a Samsung or a Sony and avoid Vizio.  The passive 3D glasses do work well though and I do like the fact that you don't have the flickering active 3D glasses like my Samsung (but I don't watch a whole lot of 3D so not a huge deal.)Overall, it's just an OK TV for the money.  I've contemplated sending it back and getting a 40\" Samsung but I'll probably just deal with this one.**Update**As others have said I now have to agree as well that the TV takes way too long to turn on.  It's usually 10-15 seconds before you get an actual image on your TV.

I will say that the internet sites I've tried work ok,though I've only tried Amazon,Face Book and a couple movie sites,(not a member of Netflix). On these sites I can watch high def movie previews,so maybe my cable provider (comcast) or the cable box I'm using just ain't cutting the mustard.

Amazon handled my complaints to my complete satisfaction.  About 2 weeks ago I started to have intermittent problems with the TV.  The TV was received in May 2013 and 2 weeks ago(end of August) it started to occasionally blink.  Blink lasted about 1 second and happened about every 2 seconds. Extremely annoying and impossible to watch.  It would stay like this until I changed channels.  Sometimes it requited changing 10 to 12 channels before it went  back to normal.  Happy with the product until this issue.  Not sure on how to proceed.  It appears that since I purchased a \"Like New\" product I may not be able to resolve this issue (guarantee times) on \"Like New\" items.  Hope these issues can be resolved.  My advise is too be cautious about buying refurbished, like new, or used.I live in a condo complex and no one in the is having this some problem, so it's not my cable signal.

However its only when this happens to only to HD content, when maximized on the TV you get the option to enable 3D(otherwise 3D its grayed out). So it works, but not like you would want it to. you have to always enable it which is annoying. There should have been a 3d button on the remote at less to enable 3d. Unless your using a player on your PC like the Nvidia 3d player.So is the 3d Great? well its OK not the best i have seen you have to sit the correct distance away from it to look good with no ghosting or crosstalk. well for most content i have tried. I do not have this problem at the theater when watch 3D movies.PC GamingGaming in 3D. Some how it hurt my head. I get a headache at times. Playing Crysis 3 and some other 3D person games and there is about 10 percent ghosting it almost like a burring effect. HATE IT!! However playing game like Street fighter X Tekken its fine no headaches whatsoever.Oh and Nvidia 3dTV does not support this TV so you have to do a small hack for it to work. Basically your override the TV driver with any passive 3d TV or monitor which Nvidia 3DTV supports for it to work. You can find the details onlinePlayStation 3it works well with the PS3 have not tested the 3d though.(No 3d Games to test it with)AppsApps works well but are not that fast. i say not that fast as my bro bought the Vision razer LED TV more expensive and the apps were Slow.ConclusionSo i will have changed my rating from a 3 to a 4 because its a great TV for the cost. however you have to spend allot of time figuring it out to make it work well. Good thing you can save configuration.old reviewI have had this TV for a couple of hours i am not yet impress with the Picture quality. I have read you have to modify the setting to get a good result, which I have done although the picture is good it does not look nearly as good as my two led 26inch PC monitors. that said it is OK.However I did not buy this TV for the big screen or 2D but for the 3D. The TV plays 3D from the Youtube app fine. However when you try to run a HD video or convert a Side By Side (SBS) 3D digital movie. Well the hold screen turns green. Well this sucks its the only reason i got this. And this feature does not work I do not know if there is a fix or firmware update as i have been searching the internet for a solution with no success.", "Date": "April 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "YOU MAY THINK YOU HAVE A GREAT TV, CHECK OUT MY REVIEW!", "Author": "Eddie", "ReviewID": "R3V2VG9UTCOLC1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought two of these TV's earlier this year.  I thought they were great as the picture looked good and everything.  Then I purchased three more units (I'm working on a special project that uses multiple TV's).  I set the new ones up and holy crap two of the TV's have super nice bright colors, and the third one has the colors of the original two that I bought earlier this year.I was puzzled and to see if the two super nice ones were just a fluke, I placed an old Insignia led TV next to all of them.  Set up a Samsung dvd player and you can tell right away that the cheaper Insignia had the same brightness as the two Vizios.  I am convinced the three other Vizios are defective.  The problem is unless you have the good Vizio next to yours comparing the quality, you will never know that you have a good one or a bad one.  For all the good reviews here, I bet many of those have the lesser quality.  And I played around with the picture settings but no use.  From the factory setting you can tell right away.The Samsung dvd player comes up on the screen with menu options when it is turned on.  You can tell day and night the difference in brightness.  The grey area on the lesser quality comes out like a grey color while the better ones show it as more of a blue color.  I am extremely frustrated with Vizio.  Do not buy this TV as you will never know which one you will get.  I will contact Vizio and let them know they have a crappy product!", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "WOW thanks Amazon for not putting this in secure packaging I appreciate it.", "Author": "Judy ward", "ReviewID": "R3UQ6WWYS8OQN2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I usually don't write reviews but this should be known. I have ordered a ton of stuff from Amazon but I have always been skeptical about ordering electronics. Well thanks for proving me right. The good thing is that I received this TV in all of 2 business days and I didn't pay extra for expedited shipping so I was really excited when I got home to see my TV yesterday. I inspect every package to see if it has been tampered with, I'm just that kind of person, and I saw a hole in the box. So I crossed my fingers and prayed that it was not on the screen side of the box and to my surprise it was.Long story short the LED lights were cracked I plugged it in and the spider web happily lit up on the screen. Maybe it's a sign since I hate spiders. So you all can guess how upset I was after I rushed home from work to play with my new toy only to be dissappointed in the end.I have ordered electronics from Best Buy and never have they shipped anything, especially a TV, in it's original packaging. They have always put the TV box inside another box with those air balloon thingys to make sure that it is secure. Shame on Amazon!!!On another note I'm returning the broken TV for a refund and possibly getting something thinner than this thing. Yes it's LED and a \"Smart TV\" and 3D but the crap is thick and doens't look sleek at all. It looks like an old plasma from 2005. Matter of fact my old Vizio plasma was thinner than this thing. It's not heavy just bulky to me and my friend even said it's as thick as his 5 year old Sony Bravia. I guess you get what you pay for.My review is based solely on how the package was shipped and the style of the tv. It never worked to begin with so I do not know what the picture looks like or if operating it was easy and user friendly. Amazon's customer service was great they sent me a return label via email. I went to the nearest UPS store, about 5 mins from my job, the same day and had it shipped back.

Since positive reviews re the picture quality are abundant, I will review other aspects of this TV that are quite a letdown.1. The remote is not user friendly. It is very small and the buttons are tiny, like on a crackberry.2. The Amazon Instant Video app is horrible, absolutely horrible. I bought this television specifically for the Amazon compatibility, so to have such a horrific app is a major letdown. I wish that I would have read a review about it.3. There is no access, NO access, to your Amazon Prime Watchlist through the app on the television. So, you have to go to the search box every time you want to find a show you are interested in.4. Using the search function requires scrolling through the letters of the alphabet and clicking enter-- a lot of scrolling and clicking with the already sucky small remote buttons. Once you get to a TV series that you want to watch, you have to click/scroll through an annoying menu. Additionally, visually the Amazon app is quite dissatisfying and unappealing. There is no pleasant aspect to using the Vizio Amazon app.5. If you love Yahoo and you have Yahoo accounts, this Vizio TV will be great for you. There are many Yahoo apps. I am not a Yahoo fan and I do not have Yahoo accounts. And I do not wish to create a Yahoo account for the crappy apps on this TV.6. Limited offering of apps. I was very disappointed to find how few apps are offered on this TV. I was expecting access to all of the great apps that are found on Roku. A previous roommate had Roku and I loved having TED on the TV. For me, it is a disappointment that Ted is not included. Also, no Pandora. There's some music app called Rhapsody-- I'm sure many people like this app, but I feel that I should have a few choices on which music app to use. There's an entire tiny remote tiny button dedicated to an app called M-GO, but the app is not up and running; there's a message that it is coming soon.The above 6 points would have led me to investigate a different brand of television. If the above 6 points are not a problem, this is an AWESOME television. It was easy to get started and hook up to wifi-- I had the TV functional within minutes of removing it from the box. And, the picture really is incredible, especially considering the comparative pricing.
