{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Pretty good quality for a very good price.", "Author": "AJ McLaughlin", "ReviewID": "R2DDU8D7W0NU0N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying that my television came promptly and in one piece, two days after ordering. I was very happy about that, and even happier that it wasn't busted up into fragments during shipping- so order with confidence.As for the television itself, the picture is pretty amazing. Some say you can't really tell the difference between 780 and 1080 with televisions of this size, but comparing it to my roommates television of the same size, mine looks clearer and crisper. No dead pixels so far and everything looks sharp in HD. It is also worth noting that the television turns on very quickly, without any beeping noises or space sounds.The sound quality is not bad at all. There is an option to simulate surround sound on the tv's speakers, which in my opinion, made it even better. The volume is good enough for me, and my bedroom is pretty large and cavernous. The TV also has enough HDMI ports for all my gadgets: cable box, XBOX, Wii, my laptop- they all fit.This is the only knock I have, and the reason it didn't receive 5 stars: When I went to attach the television stand to the bottom of the TV, the screws were absolutely obnoxious to get into the holes. They did not fit properly or easily and the screws were easily stripped. The end result is that, although it is firmly attached to the stand, it is wobbly and makes me pretty nervous about someone bumping it. If you plan to wall mount, don't worry about it- but I was unhappy with the way the stand was constructed.Still, a highly recommended purchase. The page doesn't say, but the tv comes with a 1-year limited warranty if you're concerned. I am not. I'm happy with my new TV!", "Date": "November 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "No customer service", "Author": "John P.

It was under warranty, so I called and the tech showed up the next day.  Great!  He orders 2 boards for it, they take a week.  Ok, fine.  He replaces parts, does not fix, and tells me it is the panel itself, which is no longer made and I have to get a replacement.  Hmmm. He forwards my case to On Corporation (the company that actually makes RCA tvs) and I wait.  Coming up on 2 weeks now, not a word.  I call the number given to me by the tech, answering machine.

Because of this, half-lit scenes in my favorite shows tended to become unreadable. It made watching suspense shows taxing, but I thought it was just a characteristic of HD. This unit proves that's not so. It has bright, clear colors, and even darkened rooms and caves have enough definition that I can follow the action. It also has clear enough sound that I can enjoy my favorite cable music channels.Several previous reviewers have given this unit bad rates because of their run-ins with customer service. I can't speak to that, because I've had nothing but good luck with this unit, and have had no need to contact customer service. Therefore I can say, with a certain level of comfort, that I approve of this television. It does everything I need a TV to do, and it does it well, without running up my electric bills. Definitely a good, inexpensive TV for families, businesses, and dorms.", "Date": "August 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "So far So good", "Author": "JOHN T.

Second one has one pixel stuck bright blue in the middle of the screen.The headphone jack on both produces a loud hum along with the sound - checked with multiple headphones. Does not affect the built-in speakers. Also does not affect line-out, but line-out volume is not controlled by the remote. I normally plug my amplifier in to the headphone jack so the remote can control the volume. Now I can't use the TV remote to adjust volume.Otherwise works as advertised and a good value for the price. 4 HDMI ports. Digital tuner is faster and better than other cheap TVs. Still trying to decide about returning the second one to try again, or living with it.

Oh it offers 4 HDMI inputs not 3 as listed.  The colors are super rich. Blacks are black.  The warm colors are warm.  You can adjust your colors to fit your liking. I like warm happy colors.  Cinema view/movie view is so nice and crisp.  The sound is surprising amazing.  I was thinking tin can, small little girl sounding TV.

Though shipped UPS in the original factory box alone, it came through with only minor box damage.The TV is excellent.  Great color and definition, and so easy to use.  I had it all assembled and operating in 15 minutes (You only have to use a single phillips screw driver to put the base onto the unit.... very easy to do).  Now that I have it, would I buy it again at $230?  I sure would, and I would recommend it to anyone.It has a lot of capability for use with DVD's, CDROMs and your computer, 4 HDMI inputs, as well as at least one of all the other inputs you might need.The remote works perfectly.  It has a 1 year warrantee with the RCA brand, but I still bought a 3 year Sq.-Trade for it for $29.(They cheat a bit: Though it says 3-year, it really only adds 2 years on top of the one you already have with RCA.) But, It is to little a cost for the extended warrantee to not use it didn't make sense.  I also bought a wall mount unit for it for $25 and it is perfect.  The 8 X 8 inch (200mm X 200mm) mounting makes it so easy to do and I love it; it can swing around, and the Amazon bought mounting had 756 reviews.... it was easier than they said to do it - do be sure to counter drill the 2 bolt holes in the wall stud so the 1/4\" lags don't split the old wood.  The pre-drill in the wall is the part that takes a little bit extra effort... otherwise it is so simple, all of it, and it works so well!

My only complaint is that the digital out of the TV is RCA type, not optical.

The inputs are side connected on a \"hump\" in the middle on the set (the actual conectors are about 12 inches from the edge so cables will be out of sight) -  the hump also has the 4 screw holes for 400 x 400 wall mount.This is not a set for critical viewing (as your primary set).The picture quality shows off a HDTV braodcast pretty well (good enough) with \"static\" imagines like letters, numbers, etc. showing good detail. Light source is CCFL (which is mainly entry level model) provides good brightness, but like ALL LCD's that do not have local dimming (available for top-of-the-line), the always-on CCFL (or LED) will pass light through the LCD panel and constant black levels will be more like dark gray. Again, this is a bedroom or guest room and not for critical viewing.  The most objectionable element is motion lag, which is very noticeable with moving images like sports (balls in motion).  I believe gamers have complained about this (they should have bought a plasma and not ANY LCD).  Channels like ESPN broadcast in 1080i should offset the motion lag a bit.Standard Definition (SD) images were fair - -  if the original broadcast is only fair, it gets worse when it is blown up to 46\".  Upscaling a SD 480i image to 1080P usually doesn't improve it despite the 1080 pixels  --  blowing up SD material to 46\" on upscaler & de-interlacing circuits in an HDTV that are not top-notch will produced an mediocre screen image.However, a high quality 480P image like a good DVD is displayed well, although clearly color saturation & details are noticeably worse when compared to a 720P, 1080i or 1080P source material.The sound is typical, with down-facing speakers.I have not adjusted the color yet using the old S&V; DVD Home Theater, but the colors are OK out-of-the box.  If you like \"pop\" (bright & saturated colors), select the \"Store\" setting.  The \"Eco\" setting may be too dim for many people and they'll think the image is deffective and try to return the set.The screen is medium gloss, not the flat/matte of some sets, but not high gloss - -  this apparently is important to some people who have sunny rooms, but if that's your situation, you can't do critical viewing in the daytime.Everything about the set is entry level -- owners manual that is a multi-fold pamphlet, cheap carbon batteries (not akaline) and a basic but fairly comprehensive remote control (of course, not back lit).  Buyers have asked about the control codes for RCA's -- the user phamplet shows (in small print) suggested codes for several satellite, FIOS and other service providers.  Otherwise, you can try the \"learn function\" of your multi-device controller if printed code doesn't work for you.The set is 49lbs (w/o glass/metal stand) and 63 lbs in shipping weight.  I was able to carry it for short distances using the grip holes in the sides; the \"box lid\" comes off after you remove the 2 plastic anchors so don't cut the box.HDTV sets have a failure rate of 3-8%, and if you're one of them, you will not be happy with the manufacturer as they don't have a repair network and new sets ready to replace the one you diagnose as broken, at least, not at the disposable price I paid.  After many weeks, you will be lucky to have a \"reburbished\" set sent to you as replacement (BMW doesn't give you a new car even if it's a lemon).The least expensive set I saw was a JVC model (also licensed & not built by JVC) for $4_5_0.  The JVC would probably be better, but I went cheap, and hope the RCA will last beyond 12 months and not be part of the 3-8% that fails.", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best 1080 TV I've seen since my mother's", "Author": "Briana", "ReviewID": "R1XIA0U1DMR8XJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading the ratings of this tv on walmart's website it was all negative and I couldn't understand why it's an RCA product they have been around for years!

I read a few reviews online and some had suggested trying to plug it in another outlet - sounds weird, but worked... eventually.  It still took THREE days of plugging & unplugging and waiting 5 minutes here and 20 minutes there but it did indeed work.  It has then happened at least two other times and the current episode has been over 7 days now.I tried calling for customer NO-service to send someone out for repair.  The only service number in RCA manual will direct you to A&E.; (Apparently, RCA no longer makes TVs and they are manufactured by On Corp US, Inc. and just licensing the name.)  I made an appt for the following Thu (today).  I found out yesterday when they called to confirm the time that Sears will be handling the call in my area because there is no local A&E.; The appt was ultimately cancelled due to a technician's illness at 1:01 this afternoon which happens but after me taking time off work to be here for the 1:00 to 5:00 window.  Best they can now do is Thu Oct 17 and or Thu Oct 24 - both of these days I will be our of town.  I have called Sears to see if there is anyway they can move me up since it was their fault the appt was rescheduled and not due to my inability to keep appt.  I was informed by Sears call center tech that they could not service my TV since I did not purchase it through Sears.  They said I had to go through A&E; for service even though Sears does have me set up for Oct 17th anyway in their system.  I called A&E; back and they said they could not service my TV because it has been turned over to Sears for repair.  I will reiterate that I followed the channels in the RCA booklet for repair and I did not seek outside service for this unit.  Six agonizing hours, conflicting reports on who is responsible for repair, a half-dozen customer service reps telling me they \"know how frustrating it is for your TV not to work\", and countless requests to speak with a supervisor, I have yet to speak with one at either company and have been put on A&E;'s wait list in case someone cancels on the one day of the week they are in my area.After reading reviews of this and other RCA/On Corp products online, I am not anticipating it being resolved in Oct either.  There is a history of missed/cancelled/dropped appts with these repair companies contracted by On Corp.  If my company operated with customer service like this, we would all be in the unemployment line.  I will ensure I have someone here on the 17th in the unlikely event someone shows up - just in case.

It was delivered a day earlier than originally estimated, and brought via private carrier. Several men got it off the truck and into our apartment; they even opened the box and went through a checklist to make sure that everything was in the box and that everything worked. Putting it together on the stand was really simple (we also bought a wall mount for it, but found out after buying the mount that there were no studs behind the wall where we wanted to put the tv...).The television itself is nice and large (great change from our box tv!) and clear. We're avid video game players and chose some of our prettier games to try it out: Skyrim, Halo 4, Arkham City, and Assassin's Creed 3 look just gorgeous on this screen. We also watch Blu rays on our PS3 and they look just like you'd expect it to look--nice and clear. It's so nice to watch blu rays and actually SEE the difference!The set up is simple and easy. The ONLY reason that I'm not quite giving it 5 stars is the sound. It works find, and has HUGE range, but the setup for it is a little odd. If you use the \"simulated surround sound\" setting you can't hear prominent sounds as well, but hear background noise much better (like you had surround sound--we'll just have to actually GET surround sound). The problem with this is that when playing video games for example, you can barely hear characters talking right in front of you, but you can hear the background noise REALLY well... We tried changing the equalizer around with this setting to see if we could help it, but to no avail... either we just can't work it, or it's not a great sound setting. Other than that, it's perfectly fine. If you remove that setting from the menu, the sound sounds perfectly normal.Overall great tv, great delivery, simple set up, and great price!", "Date": "December 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "RCA 37\" 1080 LCD TV", "Author": "Janet A.

So we may have to return it as adding a digital receiver would only serve to further confuse my already tech confused parents.As far as inputs go to component and composite jacks are \"shared\" not separate inputs and it only has 2 hdmi inputs.This would make for an excellent backup TV or one dedicated to a kids xbox but it's just too limited on inputs/outputs for anything more.At $298 I would rate this 3 stars but at $400 no way", "Date": "February 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "As Advertised", "Author": "elizabeth herboldsheimer", "ReviewID": "R281HLQ58FBREI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received merchandise w/Prime 2-day delivery.

Use a reasonable amount of care and a magnetic #1 Phillips, and it's not hard at all.  My only hitch was that the HDMI plugs are pretty tight, and I didn't get the cable plugged all the way in on the first try.I have an older 42\" Sony, and the picture on this thing beats it cold - sharp, deep blacks, bright colors.  RCA has always been known for vivid reds, and this is no different.  The sound doesn't totally suck, but it definitely isn't nearly as good as the picture (or the Sony).  I routed the Roku's component audio out through the Aux port on a Teac table radio - problem solved (except the part where I need two remotes).

On another note my 60 inch Panasonic 3D TV model number TC-P60ST30 is THE BEST TV I have ever owned hands down. 3D movies look incredible with the active shutter glasses. The black levels are just as dark as the black plastic around the edges. If the screen is all black you can't even tell the TV is on at all. The color quality is outstanding. If you are worried about burn in (video game people I'm talking to you) don't even worry. Burn is doesn't even exist on Panasonic TV's at all. I can guarantee this. My brother plays Xbox 360 on it every single day and sometimes he will leave the room and leave the TV on for over 4 hours straight lol. He does this on a daily basis also and the TV still runs flawlessly. No wonder Panasonic gets TV of the year from CNET year after year. I have never seen a better TV yet...
