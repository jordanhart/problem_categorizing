{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A great TV that's kind of dumb: PLEASE READ FOR SOLID REVIEW", "Author": "Brice S.", "ReviewID": "RCM0V51HGENPO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "UN46ES6100 (but this review could easily apply to the 40,50,55 and 60 inch models) PLEASE READ!Let me start off by stating that I am rating this pretty much solely on the picture quality, because the Smart Hub on this is completely junk. So why would I still give this TV 4 stars when the selling feature on this is the Smart Tv feature, because the TV itself is absolutely stunning when it comes to picture quality.I've accepted the fact that the Smart TV feature is garbage on this TV. Sadly Samsung is aware that they drop the ball big time on creating a good Smart TV. That being said though you probably won't find to many TV's that have a good Smart TV function and picture quality as good as this (except the Sony Bravia......but it will cost you big time). Between my friends and I we have tried almost all the new TV's that have come out, and to be honest none of the new Smart TV's have impressed me. LG comes pretty close with the whole package for a good price, but still (in my opinion) does not compare to this TV when it comes to picture quality.The apps are attached through the Smart Hub which means, yes, they also run slow. I run my streaming apps through my Blu-Ray player and it looks great. It's weird that an external source such as a Blu-ray player runs apps better that a tv that has apps and software built into it. Smart Hub is absolutely useless on this TV, everything from the browser to the apps are ridiculously slow. I give the Smart Hub feature a 1 out of 10. It works, but barely. This feature is not ready for prime time.Now, down to the nitty gritty. The reason this TV is still great is because I personally love the look of their Auto-Motion feature. Some say it looks \"soap opery\", but I love it. You can turn off Automotion easily and it still delivers in 120hz mode. This TV has a whooping 5,000,000:1 dynamic contrast that completely delivers. The picture quality is very crisp and colors are very vibrant (Actually to be honest, out of the box it's too vibrant. You will have to play around with it. Check the bottom of this post, I'll supply a professionally calibrated configuration to help some of you). HDTV looks great. Everything is so clear it does almsot seem like there is no screen dividing you from the movie. Blu-Rays on this is an experience all to itself. So in conclusion for picture I give this a 10 out of 10.Sound is decent on this. It's not bad. It does have it's moments with low end bass a little. Coarse my theory on sound on a TV like this is, if you bought this TV your probably like me and had some inkling that your future foretold a certain sound system......maybe a nice sound bar. So in conclusion for sound I give this 7 out of 10. Very passable sound for sure.Comparing a the UN46ES6100 to the UN46EH600 (Similar Samsung TV minus the Smart TV)Here is a valuble piece of information. If your looking for a Samsung TV with all the same qualification but no Smart TV feature, go with the UN46EH6000 (40,46,50,55,60). Although this TV does match up in every way, the picture quality is a little less (about half million in the dynamic contrast department, which actually isn't much when considering the naked eye) on the UN46EH6000, but you will save about 300 bucks. By the way, if you compare these two TV using Amazon they will tell you the match up, but after talking to Samsung they gave me the real specs. These TV's are comparable, but not the same. They would leave you to think the the Smart feature is the only difference. My personal opinion, get the UN46ES6100. In the long run you want the best picture quality. Right?In final conclusion, I really like this TV .....a lot (the UN46ES6100, bad on topic). If you read the other reviews the biggest beef is clearly with the Smart Hub, which to be honest is completely accurate. In fact this problem is not isolated to this model, it would seem that all the 2012 Samsung's that attempted the Smart Hub failed miserably. I bought this TV for $899 at Costco and to be honest I have not come across a TV yet that compares for the price. In fact this TV performs at the rate of most TV's that go for double the price. So if you buy this TV know that you will be disappointed in the Smart Hub feature but very surprised at the picture quality. Maybe the best you'll see for awhile. I give this TV a solid 8.5/10.....and I'm actually hard to please.Those calibrations that I promised:These calibrations were done professionally by the guys at lcdbuyingguide....(dotcom).

Here's some food for thought.I had my mind set on buying another Samsung model before I purchased this one, because out of all the manufacturers out there, Samsung does it right.  And that's not some clever sell tactic - that's the truth.  Go to any store, like Best Buy, and see for yourself.  I did, and was quite impressed with how well they outpreformed vs. LG's and other brand names.In doing this, I did all the research, just like you; refresh rate, LED vs. LCD vs. Plasma (and all the pros and cons that follow that argument), 3D or not 3d, SMART TV or not, etc.  The bottom line is, you already know what the specs are.  What you really want to know is how it will perform when you get it home.First of all, don't believe the naysayers who tell you that the sound on flat-panel TV's is substandard.  My living room is larger than average, and I have never turned the volume up to hear voices or have had difficulty hearing anything for that matter on this TV.  But even if you don't think the sound is up to par (work with me, here), you will be impressed with the picture quality.  When this TV is being used to it's maximum potential, there are rich, dark blacks, deep and acurate bright colors, crystal picture clarity and fluid motion, even in the fastest of action scenes  Even the most jaded of TV watchers (like my friend, who came over to help me out around the house yesterday) was impressed with it.  And he does not impress easily.  Even standard TV looks pretty good, although comparably speaking, why would you want to watch it when HD is so cool?  But I digress...The most impressive thing about this TV?  The price.  When I compare the price of this TV to others that boast the same features that cost more and offer less quality, it becomes clear why I think so much of this product.  If you want a great TV, but don't care about 3D, this is the set for you!  You'll be impressed, I promise!", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome product", "Author": "Lisa C.", "ReviewID": "R2ZUVJR62NJ8GG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just purchased this TV a week ago and could not be happier. Set up from wifi to all the apps is flawless and effotless. Purchased the companion Samsung sound bar with wireless woofer and just those 2 give theater quality sound.In response to the review below, Samsung told me the TV doesn't have the capability to install/recognize drivers/software from keyboards, but they have a remote on one side and a keyboard on the other side. I also read in another review they are releasing a wireless keyboard for the 2012 TV models here http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007IHEZQI/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnkPicture quality is outstanding, hooking up a laptop (must have HDMI port on laptop as noted) takes 2 seconds. It really isn't needed anyway since the TV is a full browser, online experience. Unless you have content, pictures/video on your laptop, then you can put them on a USB drive and plug that into the TV.This was our first flat panel, Smart TV, wireless TV, streaming content TV (both over age 50), so we are beginning users. We were a little intimidated by the price and the TV itself, but if you are new user, don't be!  The interface is very intuitive, set up was a breeze and the capabilities of this TV are mind blowing.Worth every penny and then some.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Overall Very Happy with Picture, Sound but not Smart Hub - TV Returned", "Author": "Bakken", "ReviewID": "RH04TXUSKNXAN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "EDIT: You can read my initial impressions review below, but in the end, the SmartHub was such a disappointment (buggy, crashy, web browser was simply awful) I returned the TV. Instead I got an EH6000 and a panasonic blu-ray with wifi (included Amazon VOD, but no browser).  For browser streaming, I'll just hook up my laptop via HDMI.  All of this saves me hundreds of dollars and gets me more happy than just the TV. I think smart TVs just aren't there yet. I did hook up a keyboard and mouse (both wired). Those worked just fine. That is how I was able to exercise the web browser more and find out how simply awful it is. Also, youtube never worked. It works perfectly fine on my new blu-ray (and of course on my laptop and smart phone via wifi). I will say that the picture on the EH6000 is slightly worse than the ES6100.  It's still good but the ES6100 was phenominal...especially with older or streaming content.  I think it processes those much better. I do have to update my firmware, the ES6100 would update its firmware via wifi, which was nice.  Maybe my picture will be the same after an update with my new TV.Stand & Mount:I am using the stand, not mount. I originally bought the 40\" version, which had stand that was for the 37\" and 40\".  The 46\" came with a stand that is suppose to fit 37\" - 46\".  I thought this was weird. I'm not sure if it's actually bigger but I think the 46\" TV is a little more stable than the 40\" was.  The stand looks OK, IMO. I'm glad they got rid of the shiny silver look. The black is much better.And by the way, nothing was wrong with the 40\", just with our seating arrangement, it was just a tad too small. The 46\" is perfect.And another by the way, if you read all the reviews here you will sort of notice that this TV would be 4.5-5 stars if it wasn't for the wall-mount issues. That is what has basically dragged it down to the 3-4 star range. Obviously, there's issues with other things but this seems to be the biggest disappointment. I definitely agree that if the mounting doesn't work out, it doesn't matter what feature the TV has.My Setup:I'm using a Moho Leaf HDTV antenna. That's it. I don't have cable. That was sort of the purpose of getting this TV. I wanted to use a combo of antenna, streaming and dvd/blu ray to get my fill of shows. Of course there's many ways to do this but I wanted something easy to interface with for me and my wife. So far things look promising.Software Update:Upon running the setup, there was an issue and the TV could not connect with the server for a firmware software update.  So I ran on v1001 for a while. Then I saw on Samsung's site that 1009 was available (April 19th).  So I had some experience prior to the update and after the update. The main thing I noticed was an improvement in youtube videos. Prior to the update, I could not get through a whole video without the picture freezing, sound continuing and then vice versa. It was not the buffer because the buffer bar was well ahead of this area. I would have to rewind a bit to sync everything up again. This was true on the 40\" I had and the 46\".  After v1009 this problem which used to occur 100% of the time not happens maybe 10-20% of the time. And now when it happens, it often sorts itself out after a bit.  Still annoying...esp since my phone over 3G plays youtube videos better than this tv over wifi. But I'm counting on it to eventually get sorted. I did not notice any other difference on the software upgrade. Prior to the upgrade, Hulu Plus was working fine as was the web browser.  Both are still good.Sound:Sound is great. We turned on Pandora and cranked up the volume to about 2/3. It was audible all through our 1st floor and even a bit on the 2nd floor of our house.  The quality and depth of the sound as very acceptable.  One note that someone said they don't get the Samsung start-up sound when they power the TV on.  I noticed a different experience between the 40\" and 46\".  The 40\" made that sound and showed the logo.  The 46\" just shows the boot logo with no sound.  I'm not sure why.  I sorta liked the sound, myself.Picture & Picture Adjustment:I do see a glare from lamps and lights in the room. I do have my TV pointed away from the window on-purpose. I think that would be sort of annoying to always see the windows or always have the windows closed. I mean, this is not a projector setup, it's an LCD TV. So I'll give a minor ding on that.The three main picture settings I've messed with thus far are the Auto Motion Plus, Brightness and Black Tone.  I go back and forth on the AMP setting. I find it distracting to be on 'Standard' when watching dramas. It makes things look fake, like everyone says soap opera or like British TV.  It think it looks like I'm looking through a window at live actors instead of watching a produced television show.  So I set it to clear but then I wonder if I'm dumbing down my nice TV just because my brain is so used to a certain look. I think I'd prefer Standard or Smooth for sports.  For the Brightness, I had to punch it down 10 points because people's faces were a bit glarey.  However, I watched a cop drama that was set at night and I could barely see what was happening.  It could have been that show's fault. I'm not sure.  I think I've settled on 40-45.  For Black Tone, I cranked it up to darker, which I thought was cool until I watched The Good Wife and an African American actor was in a black suit. He looked basically like a shadow.  That was definitely not acceptable.  So I've put it back to normal.Two extra notes here: I wonder where the sensor is for the Eco Setting which adjusts brightness for room lighting.  This feature seemed to work well on the 40\" but does not at all work on my 46\".  It goes dark right away.  It might be my placement as the TV is slightly tilted more and it a little taller.  So knowing where the sensor is would help me work that out.  At the moment, I've disabled that feature.Second point, when I watched the cop drama set at night, I was in the menu messing with the picture settings and holy cow it was so annoying. Any change in brightness on the program resulted in the menu dimming and lightening.  That was a result of what someone else said about the back-lighting auto adjusting to colors on the screen.  I would have thought that bringing the menu up would override this so I don't get such a strobe light affect.  It definitely did not and it was pretty bad.  Just a minor ding here since I don't plan to be in the menus that often while I'm actually trying to watch a show.SmartHub:Ok so I gave some feedback from the smarthub above in the software section. I would add a few things. I think the smarthub is responsive and snappy enough. I wondered a bit because if you get a larger TV, you get a dual core processor. Now that I've run the single core on the 40\" and 46\" I'd say that I don't think I'd care much for it to be faster. I eventually will be getting a keyboard/mouse combo. So I think navigation and text entry will be much better at that point. A couple of other reviews have said a logitech and a iomega keyboard/mouse have worked with the TV.So apps I've tried are web browser (streaming from abc.com, which went fairly well. there was a small hiccup during commercials when at full screen), Hulu Plus, Pandora, the exercise app, MLB for score updates, MTV app to watch a music video and the accuweather app (sort of clunky to find your city but an OK app). Oh and the channel app, not exactly sure what that does though.  All apps seem to work well but most are not all that useful to me just yet. Streaming from Hulu Plus was great. Streaming from Web Browser was good. I still need to sign up for Netflix to check that out.If there was anything I'd say about the smarthub is it would be nice if there were user-developed apps to run. That seems to be how you get really cool stuff like apps on Droid & iphones. If we have to count on Samsung or industry to create smart tv apps, it might all end up kinda lame or restricting. Also, I wish it supported Spotify. Well, maybe the better way to put that is I wish Spotify supported an app for this TV. err...which way is it?? I mean, it has a facebook app, they should go hand in hand since they are in bed together.UPDATE: I used the Browser more last night and this morning. I'm far far less impressed with it. There was an update last night and an update this morning. Last night I tried to go to Hulu.com and thedailyshow.com to stream some content. On Hulu it said it was unable to connect and that I needed to contact my internet service provider. The funny thing was the Hulu Plus app's trial content was streaming just fine.  Then on thedailyshow.com, I tried to bring up full episodes and videos. Sure enough, the commercials the precede the episode streamed in just fine but when the website tried to actually play the episode, it said it was unable to due to location. What does that mean?? What is this China? We block content?  Then this morning, I went to actual youtube.com to watch some news interviews (did not use the app since it still stutters). Playback from the website was fine except for the fact that the browser crashed...ohh...4 times in a 15 min interview. I was able to restart the session each time but then I had to fast forward to where I left off. It was pretty lame.  Why does samsung have to use a proprietary browser instead of maybe just Google Chrome or Firefox or the Android mobile browser?  You know, something from someone who actually knows that they are doing? Heck, I'd even take Internet Explorer (I can't believe I just said that).  The other interesting thing was that the update this morning changed the home page from MSN.com (with bing search) to simply google.com.  That was mighty odd! Saved me the hassle but really? I cannot believe Samsung didn't decide this as the right thing to do a long time ago in development?Remote & Remote App:I like the remote. I have the normal TV remote (no keyboard). I haven't heard much positive on that keyboard. It sounds like it's very slow. I did get a thing with the TV that said I can send in for a universal remote. I suppose I'll do that and see how it goes. In general, I'm cool with the remote that came with the TV. Having the 6100 series means I don't get the official Samsung app for android. I instead have the 'SamyGo Remote' app.  That's just the same thing as the TV remote (no keyboard). It does work but it seems like I have to manually enter the ip address each time I want to use it. I have to look up on the TV if it's changed (depending on what has turned on and off in my house) and then update the app.  It is responsive but I doubt I'll use it much. I had the understanding that I'd be able to control mouse and keyboard through my droid but that is definitely not the case. I'll ding the score a bit on that too. Seems like this should be possible with a 'smart' device.UPDATE: I found out last night that the SamyGo Remote app for android does allow text entry. There's two issue with it though...a carriage return doesn't \"enter\" the information you just typed on the TV. It literally does a carriage return on the phone screen. Therefore, you still have to move the mouse to \"Go\" or \"Enter\" on the screen. That's the second issue. The remote app can move the mouse on the screen but unlike the physical remote, holding down a direction does not accelerate the mouse pointer. Instead, you have to tap tap tap to increment it up and down. Therefore, the most efficient way to use the browser is to have both the physical remote and the remote app in your hands at the same time...which is of course, lame.Thus far, I am pleased with my purchase.  I really want to tweak it to get the most out of it but the manual is light on explanations.  Does anyone know a good resource that would actually explain the bazillion settings?  I feel like I'm maybe only getting like 85%-95% of what is possible out of this TV due to lack of literature.  That would be another minor ding on the score.", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV with wall mount limitations", "Author": "Lee", "ReviewID": "R38KDTAUJHPRYO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I thought this was a great TV and agree with other positive reviews regarding its picture quality, brightness, ease of WiFi setup, slim design, and smart TV features, all for a reasonable price. However, as other reviewers have also mentioned, it has important wall mount limitations. The power cord input to the back of the 46\" version of the TV is located so close to its VESA wall mount holes that if your wall mount has screen brackets that are more than 2\" wide, they will end up covering the TV's power input, making it impossible to plug in. I had an articulating wall mount (AVF Super Slim ZL8655-A Multi-Position Wall Mount) whose backplate accomodated my wall's studs that were 24\" apart. After attaching its screen brackets to the TV, I found that one of them covered half of the TV's power cord input. In addition, the power cord sticks out almost a full inch from the back of the TV; adding spacers to the bracket to compensate for this seemed impractical or impossible, so I ended up returning the TV. Great TV but very disappointed with this aspect of its design.

The size is just right for our room - we sit about six feet back from the set.We have a Samsung Bluray player, and the TV input automatically switches to that HDMI port when the player is turned on, which is convenient.The speakers inside the TV are decent for TV shows, but not for movies, in my opinion (deep bass is needed for the movies I watch).The TV does not ship with the universal remote (only a standard one), but there is a postcard with a code included to order the universal remote (for free) through the mail or online.  I filled out the request online, and the system said it would be 10 - 12 weeks before we received it.Unrelated to this specific TV, I don't like the Samsung streaming software (Allshare) which is available only for Windows (not Mac).  It was buggy on my Windows machine (refusing to ignore the standard media folders that I didn't want to stream), and didn't stream HD content smoothly over my wireless network, whereas our Apple TV gen 3 HD wireless streaming works great.

Not Smart Enough for Me!", "Author": "cyberlou_2000", "ReviewID": "R3J84GIQ29RC6O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had the set since Memorial Day and decided to add my comments that I didn't see elsewhere in these reviews.  I agree 100% with the other reviewers here on the picture quality of this set.  Best I've seen period!  My disappointments are mostly with the Smart TV features and the remote control provided to use them.  Here are my gripes in most-to-least order:1. The browser for this set completely sucks!  I haven't found a video on any site that I can watch without having issues that interrupt and stop it from playing.  What good is a browser on a TV set that is not designed for watching videos?!?!?  They give you an app to watch You Tube videos that works OK, at least until the video stops to load every few minutes!!2. Navigating the Smart TV features with the remote control provided is ridiculous!  Using the 4 small arrow keys on this narrow remote, with the Exit and Return buttons under the left and right arrows results in pressing the wrong button ALOT.  This may sound petty but it's a big deal when this happens all of the time and you constantly have to start over!!3. USB support is for thumb size drives only.  I have a 350GB portable drive with lots of MP3, AVI and MOV files on it that I would like to play on this set.  The set will not accommodate any drive with a cable that does not have it's own power supply.  Thumb drives are fairly cheap not so it's not a huge financial issue, just a disappointment!4. The remote control is too narrow to be comfortable or accurate! Thank goodness I don't have arthritis or large hands because, if I did, I would have had to return the set!  I have an older Samsung LCD set and the remote control is about 1/2\" wider. This is just the right size to fit in most hands and has buttons spaced far enough apart to let you press the right one every time! The one with this set causes me thumb cramps and frustration!  Oh, and it's a Universal remote.  After the comments above, why would I even consider using this with my other devices?!?!?5. The volume level varies widely between HD, SD and Non-SD channels.  My cable system give me these 3 types of channel formats for different stations. The volume on HD channels is much lower than SD channels, and they are much lower than Non-SD channels. I find myself adjusting the volume every time I go to another channel. Couldn't find a setting on this set to compensate for this.6. The USB port is not in a convenient spot.  Thank goodness I didn't want to wall mount this set!  The USB socket is recessed into the set and would not be accessible if flush mounted to a wall!!  To plug in a USB thumb drive, I need to swivel the set to one side and reach in 6-7\" to plug it in.  My older Samsung set has the port about 2\" in and it would be reachable if it were flush mounted to a wall.7. Lackluster array of apps & not enough related to TV viewing.  They don't even have a TV Guide app which is a no brainer to have on a TV set!  How Smart is that TV when it doesn't tell you what's on?!?!?My hope is that Samsung will upgrade the browser and provide a compatible all-in-one keyboard, mouse and navigation device so I don't have to use the narrow remote control that often!  They can always offer better apps and include a TV Guide app (Please!).", "Date": "June 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ce dimming is a deal killer", "Author": "Bob Loblaw", "ReviewID": "R29QNJY4C2LON5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this set (55\") based on good reviews and an impressive picture in the store. I was only interested in picture quality and a slim profile. The smart tv aspect of this model was very clunky and painfully slow, kind of like the old dialup days, but that was no big deal since i use a ps3 for online things like netflix. I thought the picture quality in general was good, but not as good as my five year old sony xbr lcd tv. It generally seemed washed out, and it had a pretty narrow viewing angle. But i could have been fine with all that-it is samsungs CE dimming \"feature\" that i could not take. I had never heard of it, and wish i had found a review that made mention of it. Basically, the set will automatically dim significantly when the scene changes to a dark scene. It is like putting sunglasses on when the screen goes to a primarily dark scene. I have no idea why it does this, and the killer is that THIS CANNOT BE TURNED OFF. There a lot of posts on avsforums about turning it off using the secret code to access the service menu, but this does not appear to work on newer sets because that area of the service menu is now locked and can only be accessed by using a samsung service remote. Ok, no problem i thought, i called samsung service and asked for a tech to come out to do this, and the guy barely spoke english, would not schedule an appointment without a serial number. When i told him it was wall mounted and could not read the serial number, he said they would not come out at all if the tv was wall mounted. At this point it just became simpler to return the set and pay a bit more for the far superior sony hx850. The sammy has a few drawbacks, but a auto darkening was just intolerable for my taste. And all those posts about tricks to get it to stop, or lessen-i tried them all. Only way to stop it was switch to movie mode, at which point the picture quality sucked even after numerous changes to the basic picture settings and advanced settings.", "Date": "October 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great with flaws!", "Author": "ifrit", "ReviewID": "R2GRP6VS5J741U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for about a month now. It is absolutely beautiful! The blacks on this samsung are so dark that the screen almost looks completely off. I have not seen any backlight bleeding from any angle. It is very impressive and a joy to watch on. Overall my experience is great with a few caveats. Here are a few points to take note of if you're considering this tv.First and most importantly is smart hub. In theory its convenient but in practice its nearly useless. The interface is slow and clunky. Navigation is laggy, and any kind of mouse/text input is absolutely awful. I don't have any other input method other than the remote, and the samsung remote app (more on that in a moment) but the interface is too slow anyway. It makes me just want to flip on a laptop and connect via hdmi. In short, If you are purchasing this TV because its a smart tv, don't. I don't use smart hub at all after trying it out a few times.The second problem is the screen itself. It is somewhere between a glossy and a fully matte screen. I have the tv opposite a window (couches below the window) in my living room and there is so much reflection that it is impossible to watch with the blinds open during the day; and still difficult to watch with the blinds closed on a bright day with light seeping through the edges. This tv performs exceptionally well in a dark environment but you will need to pay extra attention to your viewing environment to make sure you won't have direct reflection from a window. Cranking up backlight brightness doesn't help much, you will need to have your windows covered well. This is in stark contrast to my previous sony which was matte textured screen and had I had no problems viewing in the same bright room.The next qualm I have is with the adaptive brightness. There is an option in the settings menu to turn off dynamic contrast (which I would assume effects backlight), but the backlight still adjusts depending on content. This is probably the key to those inky blacks I mentioned above, and is usually not a problem. With movies, this is a great feature and the adjustments happen quickly enough to not distract and adds a lot of contrast. But while playing a game (devil may cry 4) there was a specific scene with rain and dark clouds where the backlight went to its lowest level. It was actually difficult to see what was going on, and as a result, difficult to play. This is the only time I ran into a problem. I suspect there will be more scenarios like this in the future, particularly with dark gaming, but the backlight auto adjustment is otherwise a great feature that unfortunately can't be turned off on the rare occasion you may want to.On the subject of gaming, yes you can. I have been playing slightly slower games of late, but I did notice just a slight amount of ghosting a few times during very fast panning screen panning. Otherwise its virtually nonexistant. The few times I noticed the ghosting, it was not strong enough to detract from gameplay experience.Power consumption is superb. I measured consumption at the wall with a kill-a-watt and it ranges from a low of 30 watts with dark images at min brightness to about 60, 70, or 80 watts with the backlight set at 8, 10, or 12 (out of 20). As mentioned above, the backlight dims itself during dark scenes which brings consumption down to as low as 30 watts. I wouldn't recommend the backlight above 12 because it didn't seem to make much of a difference beyond 12, even in bright rooms. I didn't test the consumption under brighter settings or while using smart hub (sorry!). Overall consumptions is great for a 55 inch, all thanks to the LEDs. For reference, my old 46 inch LCD measured a low of 110 watts with all settings down at the minimum up to 230 watts with a backlight set at max.The samsung remote app for android doesn't really add anything functionality wise except keyboard input. The problem is that it doesn't work with all apps on the tv. you can search youtube and other apps but it seems some don't pop the keyboard up on certain apps. Netflix is one such example, so in order to search, you need to scroll around an onscreen keyboard and hit enter for each letter. Its slow to the point of near uselessness, which is another reason I don't use smart hub.Some have mentioned that the speakers are weak. For the depth of the display, they are not bad. You can watch this tv in a large room and it fills the air well. They are not going to give stong lows but it will certainly do fine. If you can't afford the speaker set that you want along with the tv, then just buy this tv now and get your external speakers later. It won't satisfy an audiophile but the sound from the speakers on this tv will not leave you dissastified or distracted by the sound in the mean time.A couple of other plus points: the TV let's you save settings on a per input basis. So you could set game mode on your ps3 input and leave picture processing features on for your htpc, for example. It also looks really nice as many have pointed out. The bezel isn't as thin as the high end 8000 series but its reasonably small and beautiful. It will still impress!Overall, I'm very happy with the tv. Picture quality is great, especially while viewing in the dark. I have an htpc hooked up and if I want to watch youtube or netflix, I can do that via the htpc. If I were relying on smart hub to do those, the experience would not be the same. If you're looking for for a beautiful, high contrast, 2d, low power consumption tv for watching your movies, playing games, or even just watching tv, then I wholeheartedly recommend this!", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Gage", "ReviewID": "RY2FMTFCTLIBZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hey I received this model because my 2011 model had some defects.

However I couldn't find an easy way to remove channels from the auto selection. I'm sure the feature is there, I'll have to download a manual and read up on it. It shouldn't be that difficult. 1080i transmissions look amazingly lifelike, I suppose the only problem is that now I can see the wrinkles in actors/actresses faces :-)I went from a 27 Inch HDTV to a 46 Inch HDTV, and was fearful that the picture would look worse. Totally not the case, the picture looks amazing. Food advertisements are very yummy. I may put weight on as a result. One advert showed an actor diving off a cliff, made me feel like I was falling. I have yet to notice any blur so the 120Hz plus the 240hz software kludge seems to work well in practice. I don't game, so the refresh rate is just fine for me. I really wanted a native 240Hz TV but the prices are still out of sight. At just under $1,000 this is great value for money.The picture is very bright and crisp, which is what I wanted, we don't like watching TV in a dark room, so rejected plasma TV's.I like the fact it has the ability to hookup component or RCA devices, we don't have to replace other components like our DVD player straight away, but have spare HDMI ports for when we do.I am disappointed in the Smart Hub where you can watch Netflix, Pandora etc. It is painfully slow, seems to  always show 'loading' for 2-3 minutes between operations. I'll stick with my Roku box for smart functions. The slowness maybe due to my G wireless network, maybe if I upgrade to N band wireless sometime the performance will improve. My Roku box works fine using the same network, so I do believe the TV is mostly to blame. Here's hoping a firmware upgrade in the future fixes some of the smart feature performance problems.Update: 2012-07-16: The smart hub became more responsive as time wore on. I'm now thinking that the Samsung servers got overloaded, the smart hub is now quite responsive and actually quite useful.I discovered that Samsung make Android and Apple iOS apps to control the TV. The iPad app is very well executed, the iPad can act as a wireless keyboard/mouse and is very responsive. If you have an iPad or Android tablet, don't waste you money on a wireless keyboard/mouse.The iPad app also acts as a full function remote with all of the proprietary/model specific buttons. Now we have 3 remotes for the TV in the house :-)Using the web browser requires a wireless keyboard mouse, the process is too painful otherwise.I've ordered a WebCam for use with Skype.

In that department, they have hit it out of the ballpark.Here comes the \"Smart\" part. You think you are going to work it like an extension of a computer? You have got a surprise coming. Do not buy it for this feature. They extol the virtues of their smartness in their ad. Do not fall for it. In fact, frustration will result if you buy it for this reason.Ok, what is so dumb about it? Say, you have your laptop and you want to have it wirelessly communicate with the TV. Not possible. Yes, with AllShare it will present what is already on your hard drive. But streaming an internet content (a free movie) is not possible. You get YouTube, Smart Hub on your TV. Hulu, Netflix are also available on the TV. But the same movie that you can get free costs $4.95. No thanks. I am a cheapie. May be.. but heck, I spent the $1500 upfront to get this so called \"smart\" feature.

Samsung- what were you thinking? Anyone who has the wireless at home, has a computer as well. It is 100% sure. This means, they have a mouse. They have a keyboard. (makes sense?) Now, why not make them work wireless with your TV? Simple uh?  These are the simple things where innovators like Apple really shine. Make a product that others have not thought of. This is where you will stand out. Sorry Samsung, back to the design board and get it done right from the get-go. Think deeply as to what the customer wants. You have released a product that is \"also-ran\". Won't cut it in this day and age.Samsung sells their keyboard for $100. Their USB dongle for $50. Not in your life will you pay for such high proprietary product.  Then, for Skype, there is a separate camera. That will set you back another $100. You buy products on their smart hub as you go... they want your credit card # when you first set up.  This is along the fashion of iTunes.  Now they can nickel and dime you to death.  Nope, not me.

However, TV's aren't too difficult to set up so there should be no problem.SETUP:After you get it hooked up and running you can get into details about setting up the Smart functions by viewing the E-manual using the remote control.DISPLAY SETTINGS:I doubt if any of the 'preset' settings will satisfy most users.  Most of them seem to provide very 'saturated' colors.  But there are a LOT of settings which can be changed to match your requirements.  It shouldn't take long to find the ones that require 'tweaking'.SOUND SETTINGS:There are several settings for the sound.  I especially liked the 'CLEAR VOICE' setting for viewing older TV shows that always seem to have 'muffled' voices.WiFi SETUP:This was very simple even with my secure WiFi.  I just plugged my Logitech wireless mouse in and used the on screen keyboard to enter my 64 digit security code.  But if you do not have a keyboard or mouse to use it would be a real pain.OVERALL IMPRESSION when used with DISH HD satellite:PICTURE:Excellent picture after making adjustments.

I wouldn't even attempt to use the remote.I will admit I have not tried everything but general response and use seem acceptable.ONE COMMENT I saw on another review was that you cannot delete the 'apps' that you don't want.  I found that you can delete them, at least is you have a mouse.  Just click the RMB (like on a PC) while the pointer is on the ICON.  A menu pops up and DELETE is one of the options.Another use of the WiFi is to update the software/firmware, which is one of the options.REMOTE CONTROL:I don't think too much of the remote control.  There are too many buttons that you will seldom if ever use and few that -I- would use frequently.I would like to -one button- change the video mode from DYNAMIC to NORMAL.  This would make my bright sunlight to dark viewing switch simpler.  My other Samsung has this.Another -one button- I would like is a sound change from a show with a lot of talking to one with a lot of non-verbal sounds.This has probably the best picture I have seen on a LCD TV.  It's isn't 3D but on some of the shows that are in true HD it almost seems 3D.The sound quality exceeded my expectations and should satisfy all but those who want to be 'blasted' by the sound.A final 'PLUS'.

However, Samsung is apparently suffering from some significant quality control problems in its manufacturing, and potential buyers of this TV, and others in the Samsung lineup, should be very wary. If I had known six weeks ago what I know today, I would not have purchased a Samsung television.Samsung currently has a proposed settlement to a class action lawsuit covering TVs built prior to 2008 which have been notoriously problematic due to the use of defective capacitors in manufacturing (Samsung has a website at [...] to give their take on the settlement, though they have clearly not gone out of their way to make it easy to find).Unfortunately, this issue appears to be widespread in post-2008 TVs as well, apparently including my own, which I received a little over a month ago. For the first three weeks it was fairly reliable, but since then it generally falls into an on/off cycle with a period of about 10 seconds, making it completely unusable.To Samsung's credit, their outsourced local support vendor will come out to replace some components, including the entire bezel, which the vendor mentioned has been \"well known\" for causing problems due to static electricity buildup -- this on top of the capacitor problem. The new bezel will take 4-5 days for the vendor to receive from Samsung, so in the meantime, my TV is down for the count.The biggest concern is that even if the TV is repaired, further reliability problems will crop up down the road, when the TV is conveniently out of warranty. Again, at this time, Samsung's settlement covers TVs built only through 2008 even though a cursory web search turns up myriad complaints of the same issue with TVs of more recent vintage.If this TV were reliable, it would be a great buy.

I wish they still made these drives. I used USB thumb drives all the way from 8 GB to 64 GB, and all with no problem.Initially, I was only connected via my secure home wifi, and I was never successful at starting up MLB TV beyond 33% with that arrangement. I also had problems getting the Amazon Instant Video to work. I cured both by using a pair of AC powerline adapters -- one at the router, and one plugged in near the TV, and also downloading the latest software update for the TV. Downloading the update took much longer than I expected, but when I left it alone, it worked! In the meantime, I downloaded the software so I could install it via USB, but that was not neccessary. Just be patient with the online update.Even without full speed on the AC Powerline network connection, I was able to view my MLB TV with very reasonable resolution. I was also able to watch Amazon Instant Video, and watched a number of free Prime movies and TV shows.OK, great! I was able to do what I wanted, and I was able to use the browser as well. It is slow, but if you're sipping a cup of coffee while reading the local paper on-line, it's just fine. I was able to set up my important bookmarks and save them, so I can have a light browsing experience, but wouldn't use it for making purchases online or writing lengthy emails.I did use a wireless mouse, and a wired USB keyboard with the TV. The mouse is great, and I wish more functionality was available. (changing channels and volume would be a great start) The keyboard's usefulness is application dependent, and mostly not helpful. I've quit using it.I'm using a Logitech wireless mouse, and it's helpful to use in the Smart Hub screen, and for setting screen and audio characteristics when using the TV, and video off the USB hard drive. Next step is to get a wireless mouse/keyboard combo, so as to use only one USB port for both.I bought a refurbished Samsung Blu-Ray player to use with the TV for $50, and it's fine. You can almost do without the Blu-Ray player's remote, because most functionality is available on the TV remote, but it is needed to change captioning.Not having cable, the through-the-air TV reception was important. The tuner has worked well, picking up every available station that I could expect with my antenna. I made an improvement from my previous usage, by getting a signal splitter, and adding a second antenna aimed at an important TV station that was in a different direction that most of the local stations. Now I get them all without having to adjust the antenna.So, as I say, after a couple of weeks, I'm very happy with the TV, and can enjoy nearly every kind of entertainment I need from it.

Though its capacitor problem was handled twice by Samsung repair (at no charge), in December 2011 we learned the \"screen was failing.\" The picture took about a half hour to \"snap in,\" and during that time curtains of black and brown seemed to roll across the screen. Thing is, when the picture DID snap in, it was still absolutely fantastic. Still the best TV picture I'd ever had, after a series of many brands. So the news that it was failing was disappointing, as I feel a TV should last longer than 4 years. It took about 3-4 months, and the picture no longer snapped in, so watching it became more or less impossible -- doable in a pinch, but distracting! The tech said our cost for a repair would probably top $1K, and we opted to hunt for a new TV.So it must seem strange that I ended up with another Samsung, but the fact is -- for the money, it's hard to find a better picture! I looked at Sony, LG, Panasonic, Sharp, and some off-brands, and did not see ANY picture that dollar for dollar matched this one. So I switched from LCD to LED and jumped up a size to 55\" (it still doesn't hang off the sides of my stand, so why not?). For more or less the same money I spent 4 years ago on the 46\", I have a larger screen, a thinner and sleeker TV, with a great picture, better sound (I plan to stick with factory, for now, maybe add a sound bar later). It also recognized my wi-fi immediately (though I don't have a use for it right now - I stream with a Roku box, but I might transition). I don't hang my TVs on the wall, so I don't have an opinion on that aspect, and the stand had to be screwed in (the 46\" model did  not), which the agreeable delivery guys did for me. It was easier as a two-person job, so I appreciated the extra ten minutes of their time.After a couple weeks of use, I can say I love the TV. I'm still tinkering with the color and settings, but on an HD telecast it's great. I will say that when a news program shows tape or non-HD source material, those insets looks terrible... but that's normal with older media. There are more fine tuning settings than the previous TV. So far, everything has worked perfectly. The remote is about the same as the last one, fairly acceptable. If/when I use the Smart feature, I'll update my review. For all uses so far, the set has exceeded my expectations and the picture continues Samsung's streak quality-wise. I do hope there will not be some technical flaw, such as that other set's capacitor issue, and I hope it will give me more than 4 years of use. Delivery was fine, except the TV was promised on Good Friday and was said to be in town the day before, but a call to the freight company contradicted the tracking info and a new delivery appointment was made for the following Monday, a minor annoyance. Besides that, I am a happy owner and still a Samsung advocate.Added note: Chose this model over the lower-priced, lower series version because that one has only 2 HDMI ports. This model has 3, which I need for my set-up as it stands. Did note that my previous Samsung LCD had almost all its ports dead center of the rear panel, which allowed bundling the cords to make them mostly disappear behind the stand's stem. This star-shaped stand hides less, but it's irrelevant because the port panel is now behind the right-hand side of the TV (as you look at it), and slightly recessed so the HDMI ports plug in sideways - which would be great if there was more space for the stiff cables to curve naturally. This port placement also makes it nearly impossible to get every cord gathered up and centered to hide it behind the stem, especially if some of your existing cables are a little too short. There is a cord gathering hook you can attach using its adhesive backing, so you can determine where you want the cords gathered, but you may not be able to get them all wrangled (easily). The changing of the port panel location seems arbitrary, and in my case makes all the cords more visible when you enter my front door! That's not their fault, the cords have to go somewhere, but I preferred the previous placement. As others have mentioned, the different mounting options may cause a problem... in my case, it's why I never wanted to mount on the wall. Too likely to have to change mounting hardware and location with new models, and I'm vindicated in my paranoia. I much prefer a stand, though it does take up more floor space (but holds a lot of media) and of course the TV is set almost a foot from the wall and isn't as \"neat\" as it could be. For my situation, it works, but it may give you pause depending on your space.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung UN46ES6100 LED TV", "Author": "Shawn", "ReviewID": "R3RUPFJ72C6TMD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Picked this TV up a week ago from a local retailer because no one had parts in stock for my old Sony. I went to the store and watched TV's for a while and decided that his TV had the best picture out of the ones in my price range. After getting it home and unpacking it, the set up was simple as any TV should be. The WiFi set up after 30 seconds or so and the update was fast. I found that the best quality of picture and sound was the \"Movie\" setting. And yes, the fact that each HDMI remembers its picture settings is nice. Here's the disapointment.. I put in Harry Potter(BluRay) to test it out, and at the bottom of the screen are 4 \"blooms\" of light, one in each corner and two in the center. Now i've read that this can happen in LED's, how the LED's are so bright it can cause a \"bloom\" and bleed out into the colors and make them look not as bright or washed out. I never saw this on the showroom floor with any of the TVs there.. (Anyone know if this could be model or perhaps TV specific and it would just take getting a replacement TV?) I love the picture and the sound is as good as you'll get from dinky slim tv speakers(better then my SONY's). If you have a brighter room you will deal okay with the blooming issues if you run into it, if not, i'd suggest a plasma(yuck, first time i've said that). I noticed that in the day it isn't as noticeable but who in the heck watches movies with lights on? Anyways, I will update this when I have a new/replacement TV.

I took the two parts apart and inspected the base stand and found the four holes had not been tapped with threads. Just clean painted holes and the screws provided are not self tapping type.

Bottom line, if you have to do any typing at all with this TV then the Samsung interface, a slow-moving, hard-to-control arrow that moves across an onscreen keyboard, makes this a very tedious, time-consuming and frustrating chore.

I've now had this TV for a few days now and I love it.  Granted the processing is a little slow, but I have everything I need for this TV.I was debating on getting cable set up for this as well as an HDMI cable to hook up my desktop and/or laptop to this TV.  Turns out, I don't need to do any of that.  With their AllShare feature, as long as my desktop and/or laptop are turned on and connected to the network (using AllShare installed on each device), I can access each device from my computer.  On top of that, I have the internet (Netflix, Amazon Prime, Youtube, etc.) and any files I can copy over to a flash/USB drive or an external USB drive!  Plus, I can even use a wireless mouse to make maneuvering much faster.I was also debating/looking around for a nice speaker setup for this TV as I couldn't figure out how to hook up my 5.1 computer speakers to this TV (my speakers are actually pretty nice for my room).  The TV only has a single 3.5mm jack coming OUT for the audio while my computer's subwoofer/receiver has three 3.5mm jacks going INTO it (one for \"FRONT\", one for \"REAR\", and one for \"SUB\").  So what I did was simply use an extension cord with two male 3.5mm headphone jacks and connected 1 female to 2 male splitter to that jack coming from the TV.  I connected ANOTHER 1 female to 2 male splitter to the splitter above to have essentially THREE 3.5mm male plugs coming from my TV.  I then connected these to my computer's subwoofer, turned it on, and voila!  Surround sound on a budget!  I can also use more splitters to keep my computer plugged into it and they all work together (except when they're both plugged in, the sound is lowered slightly).  All in all, it's great sound!My only gripe with this TV (aside from the semi-slow processing speed) is that I wish the remote had a keyboard on it.  Makes entering username and passwords a tad frustrating (which you really only have to do once you set up the TV) as well as searching on the internet.Oh, and if this TV would accept a USB Bluetooth adapter so I could use my bluetooth keyboard, that would be awesome as well.  But that's not that important as I hardly use my keyboard on this TV anyway.I've also read SO many complaints about the color issue on this TV.  Maybe it's just me, but I don't seem to think this is an issue at all.  I just select \"Natural\" or \"Movie\", depending on what looks \"best\" to me and I'm good.  No need to tinker with the other settings.  Maybe when I get more \"advanced\", I will.  But, for now, I think this TV is awesome!  I don't even use a mount as I just set this on my table that happens to be against the wall and it's perfect!  Plugged this thing in after installing the TV's stand and it worked great!I also paid $1430 from Crutchfield.com, shipped for this on 11/23/12 (Black Friday).

But if you are interested in using it for watching Netflix, Hulu+ etc. move on because this TV isn't going to cut it.The main problem is that it can't connect wirelessly most of the time and when it does it can't stay connected.  No other device in my home has any trouble connecting or staying connected to my wireless router or the internet.  I've updated the firmware and the apps, changed routers and checked every setting all of which did little or nothing.  It also doesn't remember the security setting of routers it has connected to so you have to re-enter it everytime it disconnects.  At this point, I've given up on entering pass codes and fiddling with it every time I want to watch something on Netflix or Hulu+.Another problem is that when the TV is actually able to connect to the internet, a lot of time it still can't connect to Netflix because whatever portal Samsung has set up, of which all the data is funneled through for some reason, is down for one reason or another.  In the month and half I've owned the TV this has happened at least 4 times.  So even if you decide to connect the TV to the internet via a cable this is a problem your likely face when using Smart Hub.Even though I'm disappointed with the Smart Hub, I'll keep the TV due to the amazing picture quality.  My blue-ray player can connect to Netflix, Hulu or whatever anyways.

Having both TV's I will offer my thoughts between 2011 and 2012 models.Here goes: unpacked the TV, proceeded to hang it on the wall...and...it won't go on any of the two mounts I currently have mounted on the wall. Neither the ultraslim (samsung like) cable picture frame mount, nor an ultra slim wall mount made with steel plate and mounts etc. WHY YOU ASK? Well, Samsung changed the ES from the D ports, and made them come directly out the back, not tucked away, not streamlined, not anything. just like a cheap TV I suppose. this means when you connect an ethernet or coax antenna, you better be ready to dig a hole in your wall to make the tv flat. Yes, it sticks out and won't allow a ultra slim mount otherwise. seriously.  I CONSIDER THIS A STEP BACKWARDS. also note I didn't see near as many HDMI ports in the back. like 1, maybe 2 max. where did they go???? the un55d6050 had several and they were all slim lined and mounted to the current mounting system well.The Tv does come with a cool star mount for table mounting. and I do LOVE the new remote and smart hub. its much snappier and i have to say very nice. i use my android phone when searching the web (smart view app), and it works flawlessly. definitely awesome. the standard remote works well. the smart hub is much faster than the 2011 model. internet is quick. plan on getting a phone app if you use the internet browser. the only way it will work great with navigation.Picture compared to D series? Well, initially I hung the TV, and turned it on while installing a new RCA antenna. picture stunk. red people everywhere. colors were aweful and it was blury. played with settings for 4 days then considered maybe the antenna is the problem. yes it was. changed antennas and picture is indeed good again. very nice and sharp. whew. no idea why an antenna causes red colors.Smart hub water background is cool. and the thin bezel is a nice addition over the D series. the Wireless Built in worked flawlessly. great job. allshare works great as well. very handy.Picture isn't really an improvement over the 2011 model, but the other things i mentioned definitely are. One problem i noticed was Amazon instant video doesn't work on the browser. will not play movies. seriously its 2012. good grief. I blame Amazon but who knows.youtube works wonderfully though! not sure i would upgrade for the price difference. but i do like the new smart hub and remote much better. more responsive. quicker. no lag. don't use hulu or netflix so i cant comment.very happy with the TV, had a scare with the picture quality but got it right.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love this Smart TV", "Author": "bwalt", "ReviewID": "R3VH1AH7EUL75R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the Samsung 46 inch Smart TV (Samsung UN46ES6100) for a few months and absolutely love it.  The important \"wins\" for me from the tv include:- 3 HMDI ports- Crystal Clear picture- Pretty darn good sound out of the box (I have a large living room and feel no need for surround sound or even a sound bar, although I will probably get one anyways)- The last big win for me is the actual smart function, which I noticed a lot of viewers had negatives on.  Now I can only really talk about what I use it for - streaming amazon rented movies and free stuff through prime - but I use it all the time.  Hooking the tv up to my wireless was a breeze and connecting to my amazon account was also extremely easy.  In no time I had the options of 1000s of shows and movies at my finger-tips, and as long as your internet isn't completely awful - renting in HD from amazon is nice too.Overall - Love the TV - by no means am I an expert in home entertainment, but for your average person who enjoys watching tv and movies - There is nothing better for the money as long as you have high speed internet or wifi that you can connect your tv too (and have netflix or amazon prime)", "Date": "January 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great picture", "Author": "K.

I've only had this for about two weeks now but I am in love and I was in love with it from day one. wi-Fi very easy to hook up. I hear people complaining about how slow the web browser is but I can tell you mine is pretty dang fast..!! I think honestly it has to do a lot with how fast your Internet speed is .. picture quality unbelievable. the best I've seen on any HD TV ever!! The tv is very user friendly.. the menu options everything is laid out pretty simple.. the remote has a nice back light feature.. the TV itself is very very thin. I previously had a 40 inch HDTV . The one I just bought is a 46 inch. there is hardly a bezel around the edge of the TV itself. giving you the most picture size from the TV. honestly the 46 inch almost looks as big as a regular size 50 inch HDTV.. as for the apps and the Internet capabilities on this TV unbelievable in every way!!! it has picture-in-picture so you can still be watching your TV shows while surfing the Internet or looking at other apps. the Internet browser is truly a real Internet browser! and it seems like it does run Flash player! the Samsung App Store has a lot of other apps to download and a lot of them are free.. the only thing I don't really like about this tv is trying to type with the remote control in the Internet browser itself.. but this is very very easy to fix by just buying a wireless keyboard and mouse. USB style.Logitech  makes a K 400 model that  is compatible with this TV from what other reviewers have said.update I can Confirm that it DOES WORK WITH THIS TV!!. I do not believe any of the negative reviews that I've seen about this TV!!! Like the complaint about the TV base not being sturdy enough. which is absolutely not true in any way! the base is actually very easy to install if you're not completely stupid!! It's just one more thing that I love about this TV!!and the stand swivels.I am a very very very picky person when it comes to my TV or other electronics!!! another nice feature of this TV is most components that are connected to this TV can be turned off or turned on by just one button. the power button for the TV itself.. if the component you are using has some type of link feature. like sharp and Sony does or Samsung.. then you can even control more features with just the tv remote!! I have a Magnavox DVR HDD RECORDER HOOKED UP TO THIS TV.. So I can control my DVR with the TV remote now!! buy this TV it will probably be the last one you will buy for a very long time!! ALSO PS3 gameing is Amazing on this TV Just turn the TV to game mode in the settings and the picture Quality unbelievable no video lag at all zero lag I can't say enough good things about this TV!!! I ordered this TV through Amazon from the seller bits and pixels.. Great unbelievable customer service!!! a very nice lady named Beth help me with this TV purchase.. always email me when I had a question within like 20 minutes!! She personally made sure that the TV got to me in one piece!! very very fast shipping!! and unbelievable customer service !! she went above and beyond the call for me!!! thanks again Beth.!!

I bought this TV for 3 reasons; it's big, it's slim, and it's 'smart'. It delivers on the first 2, but not so much on the last one. The apps for the TV are all unpolished, some work horridly. I want to touch on a few things that have caused me to lower my rating of this TV, and anything unmentioned could be considered to work anywhere from OK to great:YouTube:YouTube doesn't even allow you to use a keyboard to search for videos. The input for it is extremely cumbersome, and playback is terrible. I was trying to watch a video today that would just not let me enjoy it. It would freeze every few minutes, but not due to buffering... it would either cut audio or video. I hoped it was simply a buffering issue, but I let it sit for over 10 minutes, and 20 seconds later into the video, the same thing occurred. Our internet is decently fast, and I am able to load the same video from any of our PCs as well as my phone and tablet with no issues. The playlist feature is broken, it doesn't even put the videos in order (I'm watching a video series on a video game, so kind of important that it be in order). There's tons missing from it.Browser:Extremely limited capability. I again have better luck from a smartphone loading a page. Trying to load a flash video (which is supposedly supported) of a live stream, it struggled at first but eventually started the stream. It crashed when I tried to make it fullscreen, and every time after, it would crash when simply trying to load the page.AllShare:IS A JOKE! I've never once gotten it to work. It sees my computer, but I can't find anything on it. Instead I use PS3 Media Server to accomplish the task of streaming from my PC to my TV. Big fail Samsung, this, among other things has made me lose faith in your products. At least TVs anyway. Though my Galaxy S3 is unable to control the TV through the AllShare app they offer because it supposedly doesn't contain Samsung framework, which is frankly a load of BS. I have yet another 3rd party app that does the job no problem.The TV has frozen on me multiple times to the point where I couldn't even turn it off. I had to either wait for it to shut itself down, or pull the plug. I've owned the TV for about 6 months, and I would say this has happened close to a dozen times. I was not doing anything other than trying to access or close out of the SmartTV functions.Overall, I would say that, as a TV, it does the job. It has a beautiful display and everything looks great on it - movies, games, and TV. But as far as the 'Smart' functions go, don't buy this for that. It's still too dumb to be worth it.", "Date": "April 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good TV, Lousy Smart apps", "Author": "Van E.

At the time I figured a big purchase would be better from a brick and mortar store in case I have to return it. When it arrived the first thing I noticed was the giant notice on the front of the box that says \"Do Not Return To Store\". I dont have a reason to return it, but was just trying to shop smart. (Not to dig too much on Sears but the blue ray player I bought at the same time wasnt in stock but they charged my card anyway and it took 4 phone calls and 3 months to get my money back)As for the UN46ES6100 46\" Smart TV itself, it has a remarkable picture once the settings are changed and the auto-lighting feature is turned off.  It's the kind of quality picture I was hoping for. Vibrant, clear, blacks are rich, and I havent noticed and light bleed or ghosting or anything like that.The \"smart tv\" features are poorly designed and it's a major hassle to use the remote to arrow across the on screen virtual keyboard when web browsing.  I bought a logitech K400 wireless keyboard w/touchpad and it works great - when Im in the smart hub or web browser - but that's it.  Once I launch any of the apps like Netflix the keyboard instantly stops working.  Samsung makes a their own expensive keyboard to work with their smart tv's but it doesnt work with the preinstalled apps either. This is a major downside because Samsung partners with Netflix and uses them as one of their biggest smart-tv features.They point their fingers at Netflix, and Netflix blames Samsung and neither company responds in a helpful manner.  Also the Netflix app is oversized and I can only see two movie thumbs at a time, trying to adjust the resolution of the tv once in side the app is useless, the tv picture options become all grayed out. Samsung approves these apps and uses them as a selling point but wont take any responsibility for them not working correctly. Netflix simply blames Samsung.  So, the smart tv apps are 90% worthless and but I do have a nice TV but cannot call it a good \"Smart\" Tv.I ended up working around these problems by connecting my Asus Gaming Laptop to the tv so I can watch netflix at the correct screen size and use the wireless keyboard/mouse. Thus the smart tv feature is utterly useless and disappointing.

Before I got it, I watched movies on a 27\" Samsung CRT (top-of-the-line picture quality for the era) and played Xbox 360 games on a 22\" Acer LCD. This, of course, blows both of those out of the water. I now use it full-time when I'm computing from the couch - great for casual surfing, but a little hard to read multiple paragraphs. The picture is amazing compared to both of my previous setups. I had issues with contrast on super-dark things (especially in games) on the Acer LCD and I haven't noticed it one bit on the Samsung. Black objects show up black instead of a weirdly-glowing gray.My minor gripes with it are the sound quality and the \"smart\" features. For sound, my old CRT TV was much better with an array of forward-facing speakers.  Front-facing speakers might take away from the sleek look of this TV. This TV has 2 downward-facing drivers. They're okay, I turn on the home theater speakers for anything serious. Stereo separation can still be heard from the couch, though.I tried using the Smart TV stuff, but found myself always putting down the slow-responding remote and switching back to the computer input. I had a dedicated network cable for the TV for a time, but then decided it would be better used for my printer. The features might replace the need for something like a Roku, but being able to switch quickly from media players like VLC for videos, Winamp for music, and watching videos off the web makes it so much easier to just do it from a PC. If you don't already have an extra computer, you might have to factor this into the price of your setup, though.The 1/8\" stereo in made a ground loop (humming) if my cable box was plugged in. I rarely watch actual TV, so I just left it unplugged for a while. I got an optical audio cable for my setup only to find that there's no optical-in on this TV.

I got a new standard 3.0 modem and it boosted my speed from 4 MBPS to 13 MBPS with TWC \"standard\". I think that helped, but there was still some buffering on HD U-Tube. Standard format in U-Tube was fine with no buffering and we watched a full old movie with no interruptions. I tested the same HD U-Tube program through my computer and connect it to the TV with no buffering at all so that is an alternative work around .

Both are 46\" screens. The old TV was getting a bit faded and the HDMI connector was becoming loose which caused video noise problems (even though I used component RGB). No surprisingly, the differences we striking. I also have a Samsung 58\" Plasma and Blue-Ray DVD player in the living room. So far, I judge the new bedroom TV to be superior to the plasma but I am using component connections for the plasma and, based on what I'm seeing with the HDMI (cable box) connection I thibnk I'll try that for the plasma too.Set up was relatively simple. WPS worked properly. Though the included owners guide is thorough, it is written by a non-English speaker and that makes it an exercise is encryption. Regardless, I got the TV to up what I assume was some kind of firmware (the on-screen message didn't define it) and add many Smart TV Apps. I also downloaded the ALLshare software to my PC. That was not a good experience and despite opting out of it, it added some kind of toolbar that overrode all my preferences for a home page in favor of some kind of (White Snake??)Search engine. That allowed me to use Allshare which, BTW, still is awful. Also, as many here have already said the pick and peck on-screen keyboard is a slow, frustrating means of character entry. That hasn't changed in years!!! I have not tried to program the remote so it operates my cable box but I was able to get my cable box remote to turn the TV on and off. I suspect this won't be a straight-forward process as my cable box isn't listed on their code list. I have a few wireless keyboard systems sitting around so I'll try to use one of them but I also know I have a better chance of winning the lottery than getting one to work with the TV. Samsung just doesn't get how angry many of its customers are about this. It needs to be addressed and done so it is backwardly compatible.

It has held up well to this use in the almost six months we've had it.I must admit the 'Smart TV' features are not all there, yet. They are very hard to access using the remote -- typing in searches, URLS, etc. is tedious. We've used these features only minimally. Even after upgrading our internet and wireless, the streaming video features are not reliable enough for group settings. I realize that this is not a flaw of the TV, but this is a reality for use in churches and similar group settings.We've have found that while playing material (video, music, slideshows) from a USB flash drive is very useful, the user interface for these leaves a little to be desired. FF and rewind in playing videos is non-intuitive. Setting up slideshows (of jpegs) is tedious, but workable. If you create your content on a Mac, be warned that the Mac leaves 'dot-files' (hidden files beginning with a dot, one for every content file you create) on your drive, and the TV whines about playing these. It ought to silently ignore these files. There are ways to remove these hidden files, it just adds another step in the creation process. When you play music (mp3) from your drive, the TV shows a large graphic of a CD spinning -- I guess that's better than a cassette tape graphic, but not by much.That last comment brings up one minor annoyance in using this TV in a church setting. It's really hard to get it to go to a black screen. There's always something on the screen, an error message, or some built-in graphic on the screen.With all the limitations of the Smart TV interface, we tend to plug in a notebook PC (note: you'll need an adapter like ViewHD Mini VGA to HDMI Converter) if you are using older PC with just VGA output) and run Powerpoint shows. This gives better control for only modest additional effort.Oh, and Samsung does offer a free iPhone app for controlling the TV via wifi. This is helpful when you want to control the TV from the sides or back of the room.", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best LED TV Yet!", "Author": "Barrett", "ReviewID": "R1KQQNGMIW4DVN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV on Black Friday expecting just an LED HDTV.

My first goal was to purchase a TV with a great picture that could tolerate a room with some light in it.  I did a HUGE amount of research, considered all brands and eliminated things down to either a Samsung LED or a Panasonic Plasma.  All of the reviews from Cnet and elsewhere seem to agree.  Of course you can always pay more, but I purchased this on from Amazon Black Friday during a short time when the price dropped to $1397, free shipping plus another $157 for four additional years of warranty from Square Deal.  I'm sure some paid more, likely some paid less, but I'm happy to share that I feel that is an outstanding value.  Again, do your own research but perhaps this will help you find peace is this is how you are leaning.Prior to purchasing, I read so many reviews that my wife felt I was likely to go crazy with information overload.  Thankfully, I survived and purchased with confidence.  I began the Samsung LED quest by looking at the 8000.  It's loaded with features and I chose to pass on some of those features to stay more simple and yet have the ability to use the built-in Wi-Fi, etc.  I have NOT gotten deep into using them at this time, but I will and I will add to this review 'if' something is noteworthy.  My expectations are not too high, thus it's likely that I'll get what I expected.The picture out of the box was indeed a bit too high in contrast for our eyes.  I changed too many items in the beginning and then hit 'reset' and started over slowly.  It was a piece of cake to make it superb.  You can change it constantly if you like to do that, but you can also get it 'right' and be happy.  I'm the latter.UPDATE on tuning the picture.  I am still looking for \"just right\" for all occasions.  I think I can get to that point but it can be frustrating if you let it get to you.UPDATE I have decided that, for ME, the matte finish was the thing that I had to adapt to more than anything.  That took about a week, plus more tweaking of the tuning of colors, etc., and now I think this is a GREAT looking, performing TV as I said from the start.  I don't see why 'some' say that the Smart part is not any good.  I have nothing to compare it to but I think it's superb.The Motion feature is quite interesting.  Some say a bit like a soap opera.  At this time, my wife and I like it but it can be disabled easily enough.I have no idea about how the Sound is since I have it hooked to a very high-end Bose system.  I'm sure there are other reviews that can help you with that one.Let me stop this now........I will return 'if' it is worthwhile to tell more.

Also to help those who are trying to make a  buying decision. Your comments encouraged me to consider the Samsung.  I am blown away at this work of technological genius.  For the first 2 1/2 hours I was giddy just watching it.  This is very out of character for me.  For goodness sakes I am almost 60 years old.  I have never been a material person.  It takes a lot for me to part with my hard earned money.  Would have never guessed so few dollars could give so much enjoyment.  Granted the Samsung is replacing a 1985 Toshiba 32 inch TV.  But my goodness the colors and the clarity from this set are amazing and this is with an antenna!  The colors seem better than real life.  Is that possible?  There were challenges trying to get the set to work.  I attached the antenna and the VCR (Yes, a VCR).  I tried a number of cabling arrangements to no avail.  Finally I called Samsung help line.  They said I did everything they knew of and they would have to have the next line of tech help call me in the next 24 - 48 hours.  Really, I just bought a new TV and I wanted to watch it!  When I tried to nail down a time, I was rebuffed.  I understand they might not be able to help me right away, but 24 - 48 hours?  Then the support person asked if from 2 - 5PM was OK.  It was 6:30 PM!  I asked her to have them call me ASAP.  She seemed not to know what that meant.  She also called me Johnny all the time.  She took my information and she should have known my name was Greg.  After I hung up, I continued to try to figure out what was going on.  Finally I hit the channel list button and hit enter.

This is great if you use a sound system with only 2.0, but lousy if you have a 5.1 or better sound system.  Since all my inputs are via HDMI (except internet reception) I can't use the capability of my sound system without external digital switching, which is expensive, cumbersome, and unreliable.  I didn't realize this limitation until I read the fine print in the manual.The internet capability of the TV seems good.  I don't use it much (yet), but I get good reception.  I guess it is not a computer and I didn't expect it to be.  The speakers are okay.  I have another Samsung which is mounted on a stand on a table and sounds better.

It is slim, elegant, has an excellent picture, and a variety of control functions that generally make it easy to set up the television. Samsung's on-line support has not yet been tested as of this writing but navigating the menus is pretty intuitive. The remote has large keys clearly identified and it was very easy to mate the television to the HDTV cable box. We have not yet cabled the TV to the A/V receiver so we don't know how easy that will be (with HDMI it is theoretically easy but we'll have to see). We have not yet tried to stream anything so I have no comment on the use of the SmartHub system.The quality of the HD image is remarkable - clear, bright, with accurate color and excellent resolution. Sporting events and programs specifically shot in HD are absolutely gorgeous. Our one complaint has been picture quality with programs or movies NOT shot in HD. Visually, the image is flattened and jumps around a bit. These effects make some programs look like they were shot with late 1970's hand-held video camera technology - they look like a soap opera.

In short, this 60\" TV looks great regardless of the source.  The physical size of the TV is almost same as my existing 52 inch LCD TV, and from the side, this one looks considerably thinner.I tried to set the picture mode just like my old TV, and found out that this LED TV is much brighter and tonal quality is very different.  I could achieve the same type of skin color that I am accustomed to, but I ended up using different combination of settings.  For other TV's, I started with \"Movie\" mode and tweaked finer settings.  For this one, I resorted back to \"Standard\" mode, as the \"Movie\" setting returned really pale skin tones.  Then I set the tone to \"Warm 1\" as default setting on standard was to blue-skewed.  I also brought down the background like from 11 to 9, and brightness to 42.  Otherwise, the dark portion becomes grey-ish.In any case, while this TV is incredible bright, the dark portions of the pictures are almost pitch black. Plus, there are a few options to tweak the dark colors.  I'd freeze the frame at a dark scene with heavy contrast, and tweak all the dark options.The motion control is a little more advanced, and now we can customize it for sporting events with lots of fast moving objects, as well as film based sources with different shutter speed. If you don't like what they call \"soap opera effect\", you can customize your options without sacrificing the settings you have for ball games.  I ended up setting it to \"custom\" mode 10 and 7 for Blu-ray and 10 and 8 for satellite, for example.  I played with scenes where the camera is panning, and pick the number with least jitters and acceptable \"soap opera effect\" (to which I am somewhat accustomed already).Smart TV part is OK, but I found myself resorting back to Apple TV when it comes to Internet based sources.  The web browser on this TV is a joke and I wouldn't spend time on it.  There is no way one can type in even \"1\" web address with this remote control.  Plus, the response time is very slow. Thank goodness for the 3rd HDMI input where my Apple TV is connected.The sound on this TV is just horrible.  I customized it to enhance mid range and the bass, but the speakers are just plain inadequate.  It's bare adequate for news broadcasting. So I tried to connect powered Bose speakers for everyday watching, but there was no head phone jack where I can control volumes though TV.  There is an output jack size of regular head phone on the back, but the volume is fixed at one level, and the TV remote does not control the volume.  Through provide optical audio output, I connected the TV to my main amplifier.  For movies and concerts, that is the only option.  But I know that the rest of my family wouldn't even think about turning on the amp just to watch TV.  That is why I always had a decent set powered speakers connected to flat panel TV's, but with this one, we just don't have that option.All in all, this is an amazing TV.  With good picture sources like HD satellite box, Apple TV, and especially Blu-ray, the pictures are just amazing, and at times I regret that I didn't go for a larger screen.  With non-HD pictures, well, you can see every flaw and it can be somewhat bothersome. Until every picture source becomes HD quality, and 3-D sources become more abundant, this 2-D TV would do.

Just buy LG.Here are my reasons:-I used to own a Samsung 60\" LCD 1080p that I purchased in 2010. I loved the tv, but it was damaged by an ex girlfriend. So I figured anther Samsung would be a good idea. I figured the picture on this tv would be even better since it was LED. Boy was I wrong. The colors suck and the picture is not very clear. I knew it as soon as I turned it on and saw a hd channel. Now, I regret returning it.-Netflix never works properly. Almost everytime I turn on Netflix, the tv makes me login now. Everytime I select something to watch, I get a message that says \"We're having trouble playing this title right now. Please try again later or select a different title\". I have to keep selecting it about 10 times in a row before I can get the title to play. The tv never did any of this when I first got it.-The speaker is horrible. My old Samsung LCD had better sound. The sound volume is to low. If you want it loud, you have to turn it up almost all the way. Then the speakers start to vibrate when its up loud. I even turned down the lowest frequency on the equalizer and it didn't help.-The biggest thing that makes me mad about this tv is the ghosting and clouding. Whenever the tv goes to a solid black screen, you can see white lines coming out of the corners and white clouds in different spots on the screen. When a dark/night scene in a movie or show comes on, you can see the white lines coming from the corners and the clouds.To sum things up, I would highly recommend that no one buys this tv.

Not a huge deal since my home made mount is ~3/8\" thick, but it does keep the TV another 1/4\" off the wall vs. how it should be mounted.  Second, the power cord placement SUCKS.  It sticks way too far out the back to mount the TV flush on the wall without putting a big hole right behind it.  Third, and it may not be bad for some, there is only one hdmi that mounts in the recess at a 90* angle on the back.  all the others come right out the back and not even in the recess.

I have broken this review into two sections.Subjective:Deep black helps with picture quality (lower cd/m2 for black=higher contrast ratio=better picture quality).  Color accuracy is also important with obtaining great picture quality.  In my opinion, the black level was not deep enough. Therefore, the picture did not pop for me.  The blacks looked gray, and the colors faded once I was off to the side (viewing angle).  I was watching a football game two weekend ago and notice that the grass/turf on the field was unnatural due to green being undersaturated.  When I was watching a blu-ray movie with an all-black screen, the backlight would shut off and was slow to come back on again.  Please read CNET review on this issue under the black level section on the Samsung 65ES6500.  When this TV was in my possession, I noticed some light showing on the edge of the TV screen (screen uniformity).  This is a common problem with most edge-lit LED LCD TVs. Motion was fine with sports and movies for the most part.  However, I saw some issues with motion when I watched ESPN/ESPNEWS. There is a lot of movement on this channel for any TV, but I do not think that it was a big deal since it handled most of the content that I watch on a normal basis. I also thought that the sound quality was better on the Samsung 55ES6100 than my Panasonic TC-P50ST50. I really like the apps/web browser on this TV.  However, picture quality is my number one priority when it comes to a TV.Measurements from Calibration:The color management system did not work.  Once I changed the color space from Auto to Custom to adjust the six colors, green was really undersaturated.  The Custom color space  showed dE (cie 94) greater than 3 with green, blue, and yellow.  The Auto color space showed dE (cie 94) greater than 3 with green and yellow. The Auto color space showed less than 1.5 dE (cie 94) with red, cyan, and magenta which is great. Blue was average with a dE (cie 94) of 2.3.  The viewing angle (10-15 degrees from center of the TV (viewing angle)) and screen uniformity were terrible(some light on the left/right edges of the screen).  The TV calibrated easily to D65(6500K) due to the 10-point white balance adjustments. The grayscale was incredible with a dE (cie 94) of 0.6. The average gamma measured 2.17 which is excellent.  The target for gamma is 2.22.  Contrast/backlight was set approximately to achieve 40 ftL.  The black level measured 0.095 cd/m2 (all-black screen).  The black level was set so that 0-15 IRE was clipped.  I was looking for 0.05 cd/m2 based on televisioninfo.com review for this TV.

My retailer even said that 'samsungs are their most popular selling brand' but they also said the 2012 models 'took a step backwards' & they had ALOT of people quite unhappy with this and a few other 2012 samsung models & many were bringing them back to exhange with 95% going with the LM series from LG & they also said the feedback was great & most all folks who exchanged the sammy for the LG were THRILLED THEY DID (Put me on the top of that list!). They did say Sony was awesome, which I already knew from having one, but they were very pricey so most opted for the LG when exchanging & yes, I was a bit surprised they said the other 5% or so went with a Panasonic, which i've heard both great and bad things about depending on the model....The Panasonic's I looked at were nice, but the LG was the clear winner for quality & price.Anyway, glad I exchanged as I LOVE my LG LM 7600 but again, if your dead set on a samsung, no prob.... the pic quality was good so just avoid this model & go with a much cheaper model that will give you the same pic quality for alot less money & alot less headaches...", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "The 180 with 120 is awesome", "Author": "Out of the Box Beth \"Finding Real Life\"", "ReviewID": "R3MEPJA7O9BZE8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My hubby is happiest of all : ) Maybe I'll get a turn to try some of the apps ; }", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "1", "Author": "Eduardo Meza", "ReviewID": "RHH7KB4HUCVML", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "producto de gran calidad y muy economico, lo que buscaba me gusto mucho llego e perfecto estado, seguire comprando excelente", "Date": "February 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "From box TV to this...", "Author": "badastro", "ReviewID": "R2UT9FW983V826", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Needless to say going from the dark ages of box TVs to the Samsung 46\" Smart TV is an indescribable experience.

We were one of the first to receive it and I, being somewhat conversant with computers, am simply amazed.The picture quality is superb and the sound is more than adequate for most applications, something for which flat screens are downgraded...not this one....and there is no LED bleeding what-so-ever.First, the TV recognized my wi-fi (Belkin) setup immediately.I attached my Iogear keyboard (@$35 on Amazon...which has a tracking ball, mouse, and scroll functions) to the TV. The TV notified me that some functions of the keyboard will not work. I changed the home page to Google on the Web option and initiated the pointer option. However, just about everything does work, only sometimes a little differently than on a computer. What doesn't work directly from the keyboard, does work from the TV remote...like calling up a querty keyboard so the querty keyboard on the Iogear works (a single click on the mouse on any input field). An enhanced remote will be available for no charge in 10-12 weeks.We now have a TV with the best picture I have ever seen and another full-fledged computer as well.We have access to just about everything on the Net, including our banking and bill pay accounts. However, there are somethings which will not work directly because you need a specific program not yet supported by Samsung; but you can even get around this by going to sites that have their own video players, etc....Hulu (Hulu Plus is a Samsung App.),Spreety,TVPC,World Wide Internet (@3000 channels), etc. etc. etc. That does not include the hundreds of applications with which Samsung provides you, most of them at no charge.It seems that there is nothing that this computer cannot do (Skype is included)except perhaps attaching a printer...and that may come with the HDMI ARC port, that a computer cannot do.Every day, I discover something new.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------I just ordered this WIFI TV before it actually was introduced on the market....something I never do....I am taking a chance, relying on Amazon's excellent return policy in case things do not work as advertised.I gave this item a four star rating only because I had to give it some rating in order to write this; and Samsung products usually achieve at least that rating.We were looking for a good 46 inch LCD, LED, NON 3-D TV with wireless WIFI built in and within our budget. We do a lot of streaming; but we consider 3-D in a home environment to be a fleeting fad. The reason for my writing this non-review is to provide the specifications for this TV, something Amazon has not done in its description.Here goes:FIRST the HYPEThis TV is no \"boob tube\"From its slim panel and ultra-thin bezel to its spider-leg pedestal stand, Samsung's UN46ES6100 tosses conventional TV thinking out the window. It offers a brilliant picture, but that's really only the beginning. This set has more on its mind, with a suite of Internet apps custom-built for TV use. Built-in Wi-Fi\u00ae connects effortlessly to your home's wireless network so you can surf the web or stream content from your computer, smartphone or tablet.A Smart TV with Smart ContentSamsung's latest Smart TVs give you new ways to access your favorite shows, movies, games and more, on the web and elsewhere. You'll find content providers like Netflix\u00ae, Hulu Plus(tm), ESPN ScoreCenter, and more. And a full web browser is included for convenient searching. And Samsung upgraded their AllShare(tm) networking feature so you can access your content from the cloud and even control other compatible devices.The right connections to be your digital entertainment hubTwo types of connections have become truly universal in recent years: HDMI and USB, and the UN46ES6100 has three of each. High-definition components like cable and satellite TV receivers look and sound their best via HDMI, and so do a growing number of digital cameras and camcorders. And the USB ports let you plug in a wide array of devices -- everything from a thumb drive to an optional webcam that's needed.NOW the FEATURES and the SPECS:45.9\" screen (measured diagonally)tuner receives over-the-air HDTV broadcasts (antenna required)QAM cable TV tuner (subscription required to receive cable channels contact your local service provider for details)LED edge back light for high picture contrast5,000,000:1 dynamic contrast ratioClear Motion Rate 240 blur reduction (120Hz refresh rate plus back light scanning)Internet-ready Smart TV -- plays Netflix\u00ae video and more (broadband service required; subscription required for Netflix service)built-in Wi-Fi\u00ae to link to a wireless networkBUILT-IN WEB BROWSER ...(let's see how that works)AllShare(tm) video and music streaming from a DLNA-compatible Windows\u00ae PC***Skype(tm)-compatible (requires Samsung camera -- sold separately)built-in stereo speakers (10 watts x 2)remote controlAnynet+ simplifies control of compatible Samsung components via the HDMI connection (HDMI-CEC)meets ENERGY STAR\u00ae requirementspicture settings memory for each video input-------------------------------------------------Connections and Dimensions:4 A/V inputs, including:1 component video (selectable component/composite)3 HDMI v1.4RF input for antenna/cable signalsoptical digital audio output (would have been nice to have analog as well)Ethernet port for a high-speed connection to a home network3 USB ports for connecting a camera or thumb drivedetachable swivel standwall-mountable (bracket not included)41-7/8\"W x 24-7/8\"H x 1-1/4\"D (27-5/8\"H x 11\"D on stand)weight: 32.4 lbs. with stand; 28.4 lbs. without standwarranty: 1 year parts & labor -- in-home service----------------------------------------------------------------If this TV delivers all that it claims, it might be the best deal on the market.
