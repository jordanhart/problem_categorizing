It fits perfectly on her nightstand and gives a great picture and sound. I haven't been able to find any wireless headphones that will connect with it yet (tried adding a bluetooth adaptor and also tried LED headphones), but I'll keep looking until I find some that work. She isn't able to use her arms much, so having wireless is important. Other than that, great product! She loves it and that is all that matters. Would recommend and am also thinking of purchasing one for my teenager's room.", "Date": "November 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "goo buy", "Author": "J.

The first unit shipped was defective, in that the DVDplayer would not read the discs. Coby support diagnosed a probable misalignment of the lens.  Sent it back for an exchange (Amazon's return policyis great, no cost to me) and the second unit works perfectly. Clear, crisp picture in both TV and DVD modes. Just right for our smallish RV. Light,easy to set up and move. The only thing which prevents me from rating it 5 stars is its somewhat slow response time to commands from the remote.", "Date": "July 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ciby 15\" LED HDTV/DVD Player", "Author": "K. \"K.\"", "ReviewID": "R2ILH5AZXW6DM8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hard to beat for the price.

It's 120 Volts so I had to purchase an inverter to produce the 120 Volts for it. Unfortunately the power supply in this TV isn't good enough to filter out the 60 cycle AC sine wave produced by the inverter so there is a noticeable hum in the sound output.

Because the only place I could mount it was about an arm's length away, I needed a small screen; and because I exercise in the basement near a noisy furnace, I needed a phone jack to better hear the dialog. I was aware of the TV's narrow viewing angle from other reviews, but because I planned to always view it from the same position, I figured that would not be a problem. I was wrong. The viewing angle is so narrow that the contrast varies from top to bottom, and, worse, the slight bobbing motion of my head while exercising caused the picture contrast to flicker with the movement. This might not be a problem for those who view the TV from farther away, but if you're going to do that, then why not get a larger TV?Another problem I encountered was a loud hiss when I plugged in my Skull Candy ear buds, but this turned out to be a problem with every TV I tried that had a phone jack (the ear buds are fine with my MP3 player). Eventually I discovered that my Sennheiser headphones masked the problem, so I use those now, but now I wonder about their frequency response. I didn't try the TV speakers.A third problem is the built-in DVD player: it's cheap, does not upconvert, and it always reverts to the beginning of the disc when you turn it off. Can you imagine how irritating this is when your daily viewing time is shorter than the movie you're watching? Who wants to see the same ads over and over again? To be fair, I suspect this is a problem with every cheap TV that has a built-in DVD player, and not just a problem with the Coby.Another problem I had was that I couldn't figure out how to adjust the picture width so it didn't stretch 4:3 movies to the full width of the screen. Maybe I missed something in the manual.The Coby was just too irritating to keep. I returned it and replaced it with a 19\" Vizio TV and a Sony DVD player that upconverts and resumes the movie right where I turned it off.

And let me tell you, it is not easy to find a small size flatscreen TV - there's none in a brick-and-mortar store and very few online, especially with the integral DVD player.  And you're not likely to find any of the big brands like Sony, etc.  So although I was a little hesitant to go with a brand I didn't know - I'm pleased with this and so far it's working fine.  You do have the typical issues with poorer viewing the greater the angle is, but I think that's with most flatscreens.  I mounted this on an inexpensive VideoSecu arm on the side of my kitchen cabinet so if I'm moving around, I can easily adjust the angle.  And it gave me back much-needed kitchen counter space that my old 9-inch standard TV took up.  The sound, however, is horrible - no two ways about it.  Until I found a solution, I couldn't even bear to have it on.  Found an easy solution in plugging in a pair of decent computer speakers into the headphone jack and voila - it is perfect...about a 300% improvement!  The DVD-restarting-from-the-beginning every time problem that other reviewers commented on is indeed true, but I don't find it a major detractant.  I'm just glad it has a player at all.  In summary, I recommend it highly for small spaces, just remember to add in the price of secondary speakers.", "Date": "February 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "sight and sound", "Author": "Barbara Schikore", "ReviewID": "R3L0W6JFGQX2AW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It is hard to see the screen from different angles.
