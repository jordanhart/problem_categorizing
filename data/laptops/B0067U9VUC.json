{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Chromebooks Go Production", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1U9O1XT0U6MV0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been testing the prototype Cr-48 since February.  I expected to just use the device for a few weeks and then go back to my desktop system.  But instead I changed a few of my habits and stayed with it ever since.  There is very little difference between the Cr-48 and the production Samsung.  Size is about the same, keyboard almost identical.  Cr-48 was coated with a rubbery material that you either like or hate.  Samsung is more traditional glossy plastic.Both machines have very bright and crisp displays in a wide format.  The screen itself is of the traditional non-glare type.  I can't imagine why anyone would want a screen with glare but I notice many new systems come that way.  I guess if you work in a totally dark room the glossy screens are fine.  The second version of the Chromebook from Acer is said to have a glossy screen for anyone that wants that.I'll second what others said that this machine is not for everyone.  If you a big user of Apple products and happy with their \"roadmap\" to the future, stay with them.  If you need all the specialized software that only runs on Windows, then you'd better stay there too.But... If you are tired of running virus scanners, clean-up utilities, disk defragmenters, firewalls, and tired of having to ask a relative or neighbor to get your machine working again (or worse having to pay someone to do it) then cloud-based computing may be for you.Chrome OS is a slimmed down (very) version of Linux that boots in 8 seconds and awakes from sleep almost instantly.  There is no desktop, so the graphical interface is the Chrome web browser which takes up the whole screen as soon as you log-on to the machine.  There are some \"hidden\" aspects to this OS, but you can only get to them by flipping a special switch for those who like to experiment, and the machine keeps track of the fact that you have done this.  Security experts know that no system is safe if you grant physical access to an attacker, but the Chrome notebook does everything it can to protect your locally stored information (even though there isn't much of that).  Each user must log into the machine and that causes his and only his files to become unencrypted for use.  Signing off causes those files to be encrypted again.  But very little data is stored on the machine anyway and the entire solid state \"disk\" is only 16 gig, so pack-rats need not apply.  The idea is that you store all your documents in the cloud (you are not limited to using Google products to do this of course).  While you *can* download files, typically you do so simply to turn around and upload them somewhere else.  You can display photos and play MP3 and MP4 files locally but that is about it (for now anyway).  In addition to the SSD space you can store local files on a USB stick or memory card (as used in cameras).  Theoretically files you store on the SSD drive will get erased automatically after a while (like a month, though I haven't seen this happen yet).  So if you feel you just HAVE to have some files to carry around with you, a 16G USB stick is probably advisable.If you want to let a friend use the machine, just sign off and they can use \"Guest mode\" and your stuff will be safe, no matter what they do.  Also anything they do will get erased when they are done.  If someone else will be using he machine regularly they can also sign in with a Google ID rather than using Guest mode and their files and yours will be kept isolated from one another.I'm not sure what it is I like about this keyboard as it mostly resembles other \"island keyboards\" but I bang pretty hard on the keys and they usually register without too many mistakes.  I don't feel that I am in danger of breaking the thing as is the case with many new notebooks or keyboards.  The mousepad as others have mentioned is HUGE.  I am not a big fan of mousepads so even with a notebooks I tend to carry a mouse with me.  I recently went visiting needed to use the mousepad for a while though and found it acceptable.  I'd say a cut below the Apple mouspads, but not by much.  Remember that most of what you get from a mousepad is done in software, not hardware.  When the Cr-48s came out there were lots of complaints about the mousepads being almost unusable, but with each new release of the OS things got better and I'm sure that will continue.With Chrome OS being a young product so far there is still room for improvement, but the improvements are coming fairly regularly and they are totally non-disruptive, downloading in the background and automatically activating the next time you boot.  Even that first boot after update doesn't seem to take longer as with some OSs.There are three \"Channels\" for updates: Stable, Beta, and Dev(eloper) depending on how risk averse you are.  There is also a USB stick based recovery procedure should your machine get \"hosed\" which can happen on the developer channel or when playing with the developer switch.Why is there a developers switch?  Well, security is a big goal of Chrome OS.  There are no virus scanners needed, but the OS does do a self-check during those 8 seconds it is booting up, and when your files are decrypted they are check for tampering as well.  The developers switch bypasses some of this paranoia, and also gives you access to additional parts of the file system that are normally off-limits.  In addition you are given access to a more complete set of Linux/Unix commands some of which could get you into trouble.  People have run other version of Linux, Windows and even the Apple OS on Chromebooks by flipping the developer switch, but then that is rather missing the point of a machine that is designed specifically for cloud-based computing.  On the other hand, if you have been keeping your stuff in the cloud, and happen to trash your system while on the road, getting it going again doesn't take too long or involve too many steps (and I suspect might eventually only entail pressing a reset button or something).Finally, on communications, WiFi set-up is as easy or easier than Windows or Apple machines I've used.  Previous connections are memorized by default.  All the protocols up to and including \"n\" \"just work\".  In a pinch you can tap into the 100M of free Verizon wireless 3G coverage.  In a real pinch they have various for-pay coverage after that.  I've tried it just long enough to know that it works.  On a trip I can imagine tapping into the \"unlimited\" plan for a day at a time between WiFi enabled hotels.Cons: (1) I wouldn't have minded a wired Internet option as well, but with notebooks getting thinner and thinner it would probably be hard to squeeze the connector in there.  So far the \"n\" version of WiFi maxes out my router's speed anyway.  (2) Only VGA connectivity to external monitors... else I might be tempted to use this as a desktop machine with a larger monitor.  If there is indeed a Samsung \"mini\" desktop system waiting in the wings that will probably be a better way to go anyway (and might well be significantly cheaper than a laptop). (3) There is a way to go for \"apps\" for this ecosystem.  there are advanced applications that demonstrate what *can* be done such as music composition, technical drawings, photo editing (and of course Google Docs which handles normal office needs) but almost everyone will run into situations that require a \"legacy\" system to handle.  For example, you currently have to use a special set-up on a Windows or Apple machine to print, unless you have one of the very new \"e-printers\" that have an e-mail address associated with them and support their own network connection.  If the Google \"roadmap\" holds steady I fully expect these issue to be addressed in the not too distant future.In the mean time, I'm sitting comfortably here on my couch with my Chromebook, and not tempted to sit at the desk where I have a \"more powerful\" system.  Come to think of it, I have more power in the cloud than I could ever afford at home.  With proper interfaces, everything I could need.", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing product!", "Author": "M G", "ReviewID": "R2A2S1JFYOWHHF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very happy with my Samsung Chromebook. I had been looking for a computer that was fast, easy to use and did not keep breaking down so when Google announced the Chromebook Pilot program I signed up and got the CR-48. I really liked my CR-48 and therefore bought the Samsung Chromebook with 3G at the Gilt flash sale. I've had it now for a few days and am very happy with it.The Samsung Chromebook is very light weight and portable; and I like its clean looks and solid finish. The keyboard is amazing and the trackpad is HUGE. It also feels a lot faster than the CR-48. The software on the CR-48 kept improving and getting better in the 6 months I had it and it feels like its gotten even better on the Samsung Series 5. There's now a file manager and a media player and it is super easy to upload photos to Picasa. And ofcourse it has Chrome which is fast.The setup was ridiculously simple. As soon as I logged in all my apps, bookmarks and settings came in and it felt like I was back on my old computer. In all I think I went from closed box to fully ready in a couple of minutes. This was truly amazing. All the other benefits of the CR-48: the fast boot, quick resume and built in 3G are all there in this Chromebook.I would recommend a Chromebook to anyone; but when people ask me if this is right for them this is what I say: it's great if you primarily use a laptop/ notebook for your personal stuff which, at least for me, is almost all web-based - gmail, facebook, amazon, youtube, google docs. For 'work' I use design software (Adobe CS5, Autocad, etc) that needs serious processing power and a large screen; and thus I use a high-end laptop, but that means it's  heavy and cumbersome. The Chromebook is my personal computer and it works perfectly for that purpose - we leave it lying around the house and pick it up whenever we need to do something that is not work related. It also helps that its battery life is phenomenal. When my parents (NOT tech-savvy) were over they also used the CR-48 a lot and it worked great for them. I plan to get a new Chromebook for them too. So if you want a notebook for personal use that works fast, is reliable and inexpensive, get this one.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung Chromebook: First Impressions", "Author": "Chipp Walters", "ReviewID": "RZ24R2X0VVZWD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "**UPDATE**I've removed a star from the previous 5 stars because I had to recently send my Chromebook back to Samsung when the battery quit working. It absolutely refused to take a charge. I suspect the battery is not the problem, but either a software or hardware glitch is responsible, and the Chromebook forum's recommended action to remove the battery can't work as this battery is embedded in this model.I hope this isn't symptomatic of a poor design standard from Samsung. I used to really like Samsung, but I've been having more and more problems with their products as of late. My father's three year old $3K+ 54-inch plasma screen went out and we ended up replacing it with a new Sharp LCD-- which cost much less than fixing the Samsung. Let's hope Samsung gets their product quality back up to where it once was.FWIW, I still very much enjoy using it and believe the concept to be excellent!--------------------------------------------------------------Recently, I purchased this Samsung Series 5 Arctic White 3G Model Chromebook. For those of you who don't know, Chromebook is a notebook computer which runs Google's Chrome OS and is for the most part just a Chrome browser in a notebook. I know, it sounds rather simple and not very exciting. But, knowing how much I depend on Google for business and after doing a bit of research, I became interested enough in it to purchase one and try it out. Here's what I now think of it after using it for three days.Early impressions are extremely positive. It has many of the features I really like of the iPad while also retaining much of the functionality I like in netbooks. I should mention, I run a virtual company and we pretty much run on Google Apps, including accessing email in Gmail, creating and editing documentation in Google Docs, and with most spreadsheet work done using Google Spreadsheet. We aso like Google Presentations as a collaborative tool for creating slide presentations. We use many online tools, including Basecamp, Freshbooks, Quicken Online, Dropbox, FogBugz among others. So, it's fair to say, we do a whole lot of computing already 'in the cloud.'The implementation of the Chrome browser is great. It looks and behaves exactly the same on Windows and MacOS, which was a bit of a surprise to me seeing how it's based on a Linux kernel. When I first logged in, the Chrome browser already had all my bookmarks and personal preferences setup as I had on my other Chrome installs (PC and Mac), which was a nice surprise. In fact, install should have been a snap, but a forced ChromeOS update hung a couple times, forcing me to hard restart, but it finally hooked up. I'm not sure, it may be an issue with my bandwidth, ISP, or even the Google Chrome update servers seeing I got mine as fast as possible, along with, I'm sure, MANY MANY others.The Samsung Chromebook is a bit larger than netbook computers, but smaller than most notebooks. The keyboard is easy to use. It's fairly light for a notebook but still weighs twice the iPad2. The Chromebook display is much higher resolution at 1280 x 800  vs the iPad's 1024 x 768 and the Chromebook has a whopping 2GB of memory versus the iPad2's wimpy 512MB (iPad 1 is only 256MB). Both iPad and Chromebook use solid state drives, with the iPad having three configurations to choose from: 16GB, 32GB and 64GB. This Chromebook only has 16GB, but does have an SSD slot along with a couple of USB ports where you can add more memory. Because the Chromebook focusses on connecting to the Internet and storage in the cloud, I don't see lack of local storage as a significant detractor.Chromebooks can be purchased from $349 to $499 (this one), the topend being a bit more expensive than one might expect. I think this price may come down as more of them are sold, still they are quite competitive when priced against current tablet models including iPad.The PositivesExtremely long battery life. No kidding. Reportedly it can run continuously for 8 hours. I've not had to recharge any more than once per day-- just like my cell phone and iPad. I also have Sony Vaio and MacBook Air laptops, and neither get even close to iPad or Chromebook in battery life.Instant on. And instant connection to wireless. My Chromebook takes 8 seconds to boot-- from a cold start. Closing the lid puts it to sleep and it resumes from sleep instantaneously, much like my AirBook. But unlike my AirBook and more like the iPad, the wireless connection seems to be instantly connected. I've set mine to force a password login from sleep mode, something I would encourage anyone to do who owns a Chromebook or iPad.3G so I can connect anywhere. Combined with extreme battery life, this is one of the most valuable features of this particular model. Furthermore, Verizon gives away free 100MB of transfer per month for the first two years of ownership. I used to think having a wifi hotspot was just as good, and I do have one of those as well, but my good friend convinced me otherwise after seeing him pull out his 3G iPad, check his email and put it away in 30 seconds. The darn wifi hotspot takes over two minutes just to boot, not to mention having to connect it to a laptop, iPad or iPhone. As such, I'd never use it to quickly check an email or Google an address.No auto-correction, it's replaced by good spellchecking. I find when I send emails on the iPad, I have to constantly check to see what iOS has automatically corrected and changed. I know I can turn it off, but sometimes it does come in handy, just not always. It's SO MUCH EASIER TO TYPE emails on a Chromebook than on an iPad-- and this is one of the reasons folks like my business partner, an extreme typist, may prefer a Chromebook over iPad as an Everday Portable Computing Device (EPCD).Large trackpad with MacOS type functionality. I do admit, I mostly prefer Apple's implementation of trackpads. Two-finger scrolling and a physical click directly on the trackpad help make it easy to use. Still, dragging and dropping is somewhat difficult, just like on my MacBook Air, which IMO is better done with two fingers on opposite hands. The feel of the trackpad is very smooth and works as well as on Mac devices.Keyboard modifications make it actually easier to use. There's no caps lock key, which surprisingly to me, is not missed at all-- in fact, it's better because I don't accidently hit it when typing. It is replaced by a search key which opens a new browser tab and highlights the URL field. If you really want CAPS LOCK back, you can choose to do so in Chromebook settings. Also, the mostly useless function keys on other keyboards are replaced by much more useful keys like: forward, backward, refresh, full screen, show next window, brightness and audio volume buttons. Much better.Printing is easy to setup and just works. I was able to easily setup my Epson wired and HP wireless printers to work with the wireless Google Cloud Printing. I was a bit concerned this would be an issue, but it turns out it just worked-- not as seamlessly as Apple's AirPrint, but easy nonetheless.Multi-user accounts make this a family computer. As I mentioned before, I'm all setup on Google Apps, and so is my wife and daughter. Because I don't need to worry about viruses on the Chromebook, or any files getting damaged or lost as they're stored in the cloud, I can easily lend my Chromebook to my wife and daughter for them to use. They each use their existing Gmail account sign on and then they're good to go. So, if my wife goes out of town, she can take the Chromebook with her to check emails, bank balances, etc. and it's more secure because of the 3G access (We all know those wireless access points are not always very trustworthy!).Lost or damaged Chromebooks aren't as expensive as one might first imagine. The first thing I think about after spilling Red Bull on my notebook keyboard and watching the screen fritz is \"what data have I lost?\" -- and this is the real expense of a lost, stolen or broken laptop. When all the data is stored in the cloud, that question pretty much goes away. Furthermore, the Chromebook is not as expensive as my MacBook Air or Vaio, so if something does happen to it, no data is lost and it's less expensive to replace with a new one which is up and running in no time at all. This is huge, and one reason I'd like to talk my Dad into using one, as sometimes he forgets which file he left on which computer or he downloads new Windows apps which 'promise' to speed up his computer, but instead install viruses, which I later have to remove.Economic model is great for small businesses. You can 'rent' a Chromebook for between $20-30 per month for employees, and Google will take over all help desk responsibilities. This is huge, and IMO, a real gamechanger. The business administrators can configure all employees Chromebooks from one central interface. And, if your Chromebook breaks it is immediately replaced free of cost. This is huge for small businesses who can now spend less on IT and more on productivity-- assuming you have no need for standard business apps like MS Office, which many, like us, have given up in favor of Google Apps. For those diehards who absolutely need to run MS Office, there are several HTML5 remote desktop computing solutions which allow Chromebooks to run remote virtual instances of Windows7 running Office and other Windows apps, but it seems counterproductive to the ease-of-use premise of Chromebook.Chromebook runs Flash with no problems-- along with several other web application frameworks. There are many web applications which try to replace desktop applications using Flash and Flex.For instance, Aviary.com has a bunch of really cool apps including their Phoenix image editor which mirrors much of what Photoshop can do-- and they all run in a browser using Flash. I've had no problems using these products including HTML5 apps which allow me to FTP into WordPress sites, and even edit directly the php and CSS files directly. Certainly, there are many more on the way. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for either iPad or Android.The NegativesA few keyboard issues. There is no delete key. There is a backspace key. For Mac users, this is probably no big problem as the Mac doesn't have one either. But for many of us Windows users the delete key is critical to our workflow. Hope this is fixed in newer versions. But Mac users will be disappointed with the undo,cut, copy and paste keyboard shortcuts. There is no Apple command key so you have to use the CTRL key as a modifier, which is quite a finger stretch for those trained on the easy Command-Z,X,C and V workflow.There is no Netflix. Yet. For those of you hooked on Netflix, it's rumored to be in the works, but currently there is no way to play Netflix. I suspect this is because the OS is based on Linux and for some reason, Netflix has some specific requirements which only run on MacOS and Windows and iOS.There are many applications which have no online counterparts. No decent 3D apps are available as web apps. And of course neither support for the real Photoshop and MS Office or my favorite programming language, LiveCode. We all have our 'gotta have' applications, and many of mine are just not available.No GoToMeeting or Skype. For me, these both are two of the biggest detractors right now for Chromebook. I depend on both these apps during the day, and both are supported on the iPad. Though, frankly, GTM on iPad is pretty bad-- you can't initiate a meeting nor can you do any sort of screen sharing. Google Voice does work on the Chromebook. While there are plenty of rumors, there's no word yet on when or if there will be an HTML5 or Flash version of Skype. There are some pretty decent chat clients. One isNo Network, No work. This is a common complaint for most reviewers of Chromebook. But, for me, it's not such a big deal. I only want to use my Chromebook when I need web access, so I purchased it with 3G built in. So, unless I'm flying somewhere, or way out in the country, web access shouldn't be much a problem-- and if I can't have Internet access, I doubt there's much I really want to do. Also, I don't think of my Chromebook as my only machine, only as possibly the one I may end up using the most.Final thoughtsFirst of all, I hope others see the value in owning a Google Chromebook. Because as more users buy them, more companies will have to take note and begin support for them.As products and operating systems become more and more complex, the simplicity of accessing and storing data on the cloud using only a browser is appealing to those who crave for a simpler and easier way to do things. This is an important step in lessening our collective dependency on older and more antiquated OS'es, which are providing less and less value to us as they become more and more complicated. Fact is, modern OS'es have been looking like the same animals, doing the same things, offering the same features. Apple's new OS named Lion now has many similar features as Windows 7, including the much needed ability to resize a window from any edge. But also, looking forward, Lion also adds some very interesting iOS features, such as implementation of fullscreen mode which does away with windows-- and acts more like a fullscreen BROWSER-- just like Chromebook already does! I expect if ChromeOS is successful, it will start to implement Android type features much like Lion has adopted iOS capabilities.I personally think Chromebook is excellent family based computer as well as perfect for many small businesses. And for myself, someone who owns a desktop PC, Mac and Windows laptop, and iPad, the Chromebook will be an interesting fit. It will be telling to see how much time I spend using it-- my guess is it will take over much of the space my iPad used to use. I enjoy the iPad because of it's instant on, super long battery life, and super fast and capable connectivity to the web-- all things make it a superb Everday Portable Computing Device. The Samsung Chromebook has all of this PLUS I can now view Flash, type emails without looking at the keys (instead of hunt-and-peck on iPad), and have an overall better browsing experience. We'll see.", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good First Try", "Author": "Chris Macias", "ReviewID": "R16QL4MBQRM04A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros:Battery Life- this outshines my Sony machine. With the sony I can last about 2.5-3 hours. on this machine I can get over eight hours, a huge plus!Cloud- it is very nice to have work synced up with my main Sony machine. This is of course if you are comfortable using Google's web applications. I would make sure not to utilize the cloud for any sensitive information.Boot-Up- almost instantaneous! Definitely nice to not have to wait on a desktop to load upCons:Keyboard layout- Some minor quips about  button placement. The top row of function keys have been replaced with web-centric keys, I never use them! I having been using Alt + Arrow keys to navigate and Ctrl + R to reload  on my Sony I still do this. There is no delete button, instead the power button takes up the position where the delete key resides on my Sony. I have to consciously adjust my typing since all i have to work with is a backspace button. The Caps Lock key has been replaced by a dedicated search key, I hardly used the Caps Lock key, so I have tendency to not use the search key as much as the designers had intended. Other notable missing keys that I had used often are: home, end, page up, and page down.Mousepad- I have been using both a Sony Laptop and Macbook Pro, both with multi-touch functionality. It is disappointing to to not see similar execution built into the over-sized touch pad.  Right clicking is a little awkward using two fingers to get the right click menu. However, Drag and Drop is made painful  by placing one finger down and using the other to drag the item around the screen, while keeping the other  one still in its place. Not very well executed, and can be uncomfortable.Data- 100MB for one month! Ridiculous with the amount of content on a single page, I would be surprised if you didn't hit the ceiling by the end of one week let alone a couple days. I checked my facebook page, logged into gmail, and updated my tweetdeck app, in a matter of 15-20 minutes i had used up 12MB of the 100MB allowance. The pricing on the data options are very unreasonable. 5G of data for one month will set you back fifty dollars! Of course this is the same treatment that smartphone users have to endure, an unfortunate consequence of an oligopoly .Google Music Beta- having been an early adopter of the chromebook, I would have thought that Google Music would be pre-installed or at least a definite  invite.Removable Media-  I tried plugging in my Western Digital 1 TB external to test out the file manager, that I had read about. After about 3 minutes of waiting, I gave up and unplugged the device. It was taking way to long to try to read the files.Lack of Apps- The Chrome Market has many apps, but very few great apps, while this is most likely due to the infancy of this platform, I find the lack of options a little diappointing.Notes:  The computer was designed with the sole purpose of consuming content on the Internet. It does not disappoint in this arena. However, I can not recommend the device as a laptop replacement, or content generator.  It is very convenient for traveling, being light weight and able to connect to either 3G or nearby wireless networks with ease. I would say this would be a suitable substitute for  smart phone web browsing allowing you to save battery life on your precious iOS or Android device.  I am satisfied with my purchase, and believe it is a good first attempt.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Soaring in the clouds !", "Author": "Gary Lai", "ReviewID": "R3QHOTDMR5CGR9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For people willing to evolve to cloud computing and with access to good WiFi or 3G most of the time, this is a great product. It is not going to totally replace a Windows or Mac computer for most people, but I find I can do 95% of my daily computing much faster and easier with my Chromebook. Before I bought it, I was ready to replace my 4-year old Windows laptop which is running like molasses now, and was not looking forward to spending days setting up a new Windows machine between migrating over all my files, uninstalling all the bloatware, setting up the antivirus and firewalls, installing all my programs, etc.. But now, with my Chromebook (which took less than 5 minutes to set up out of the box), I don't have to replace my old Windows laptop at all. I can just keep it in a drawer and pull it out for the two times a month I need to use it. If my Windows laptop ever totally dies I can replace it with a used or low-end cheap Windows laptop since my primary computer is now my Chromebook. This is saving me money and lots of time in the long run, and it's the reason why you would want a Chromebook and a Windows/Mac laptop at the same time.Now onto a review of the Chromebook itself - battery life is really 8 hours with normal use, as advertised, and it really does cold-boot in 8 seconds and resume from sleep in 1 second. Once you get used to this, everything else will seem like a throwback from the stone age. The screen is very bright and nice and the keyboard is a breeze to type on. Instead of  the cryptic F1 through F12 buttons you'll see on top of a Windows laptop keyboard, you have browser navigation buttons like Back, Forward, Refresh, Full Screen, which is very convenient. The trackpad takes some getting used to because it has multi-touch features and has no buttons (you physically press on the keyboard with one finger until it clicks for left click, or with two fingers for right click), but after a few days, I was proficient with it. It works fine with a mouse too. It feels super light and thin to carry. Many of the software issues reported in earlier reviews have now been fixed by Chrome OS updates which comes out automatically every 6 weeks. I haven't experienced even a single crash of the browser in 2 weeks of daily use. The build quality is very good in my opinion. In terms of web page loading performance, it's pretty fast - much faster than a comparably priced laptop. Hulu and other flash-based video is a bit jerky at 720, but if you turn it down to 480 it gets much better. Streaming video on Netflix works great, no jerkiness at all. Rhapsody/Napster and Amazon Cloud Player works great for listening to music, and of course, so does Google Music Beta.All the reviews that say you should just get a Windows netbook for the same price and run Chrome browser on it instead to get the same experience just don't get the whole Chromebook concept. Not only will you not get instant-on and 8 hours battery life out of a Windows netbook, but you'll have to deal with all the required maintenance of Windows. You can get a new Ultrabook or Macbook Air now for 2-3 times the price of a Chromebook that gives you (almost) instant-on and 8 hours battery life, but it'll still be running Windows or Mac OS with its endless time consuming updates, the background churning of the anti-virus/malware protection software, the battle with the bloatware. Despite all this maintenance, your Windows machine will just get slower and slower as time goes on, and if you lose it or damage it, you're going to be back to square one setting up a new machine.  On the other hand, a Chromebook requires zero maintenance, and over time it just gets faster and faster with OS updates that refresh the image. If you were to lose or accidentally destroy your Chromebook tomorrow, you can get a new one, turn it on, and literally be back exactly where you were in less than one minute. If you log onto a friend's Chromebook, it will be as if you're using your own since with your Google account login it will sync all your bookmarks, themes, and apps automatically no matter what machine you're using. This is revolutionary.Now, since most criticisms about a Chromebook revolve around what people think it cannot do, let me debunk some myths:- Printing: Yes, it can print. Google has a service called Google Cloud Print that works with web connected printers sold by HP, Epson, and Kodak. Basically you send the document directly over the web to your printer. Getting one of these printers will allow you to print directly from the Chromebook or a smartphone or a tablet (Android or Apple iOS). If you don't have one of these printers, you can still print from your Chromebook by sending the print job to a Windows or Mac machine instead, which will print it to any printer it is connected to.- Microsoft Office documents: Yes, you can work with Microsoft Office documents. Google Docs, a fully functional web-based word processing/spreadsheet/presentation productivity suite, can open Microsoft Word and Excel documents by converting them into Google Docs format, and then can save them back in Word or Excel format after you are finished editing if you want to. Also, Microsoft offers a free version of Office Web Apps and a free 25 GB cloud storage Skydrive account, which allows you access to versions of Word, Excel, and Powerpoint through the web browser.- Local Files: Yes, you can download files from the web onto your Chromebook. It has 16 GB storage and also has an SD card reader. So for example you can pop your SD card out of your camera onto your Chromebook and look at the pictures or upload them to Picasa or whatever cloud storage you use. You can connect to USB thumb drives or USB hard drives and manage the files on those. You can download an MS Word document to your Chromebook and upload them to Google Docs or Microsoft Office Skydrive for editing and sharing. It's a little more cumbersome to work with local files than on Windows, but it does work.- ZIP files: Yes, it opens Zip files with the latest version of the OS.- Working offline: Contrary to what is stated in many reviews, a Chromebook is not a brick when offline. You can read Gmail and compose new messages which sync when back online. You can view (but not edit) your Google Calendar and Google Docs documents, although Google is reportedly working on bringing offline editing back to Google Docs. In the meantime, there are free apps like Scratchpad which allow you to do light word processing offline and sync with Google Docs when back online. The media player can play MP3s and MP4 video files from local storage or an SD card. Lots of games work fine offline. You can read your Kindle books offline with the Kindle Cloud Reader. I'm sure there are many more apps on the Chrome Web Store that work offline I haven't discovered. In short, if you're on an airplane flight and there is no WiFi, your Chromebook can still keep you plenty occupied.And here's what a Chromebook cannot (at least I haven't figured out a way) that will cause you to dig out a Windows or Mac computer:- Java/Silverlight: No, the Chromebook currently does not support websites that require Java or Silverlight. However, it does support Javascript, which is what you're more likely to run into on a daily basis. Most people will not miss lack of Java or Silverlight support.- CD/DVD drives: Chrome OS currently does not support external CD or DVD drives. But seriously, CDs and DVDs will be going the way of 8-track tapes and vinyl in a few years.- Scanner: Chrome OS does not support use of scanners yet.- Bluetooth -  I think the Samsung Series 5 and Acer AC700 actually have Bluetooth radios, but the Chrome OS doesn't support it yet. It's supposedly coming soon.- Desktop applications: You can't install programs on the Chromebook. The locked down operating system is one of the key benefits of the OS (it provides the security against malware and makes the OS simple and light), but also it's primary drawback. Since you can't install any programs on the Chromebook, desktop applications like Microsoft Office, Skype, or video editing tools will not work. There are existing web applications that can replace many of these things and many more are coming out every day, but if you find that you simply cannot live without desktop applications and must use them all the time, then a Chromebook is not for you.Now, the question of a Chromebook vs. a tablet comes up in many reviews. I personally own a tablet (Asus Transformer) as well, that I'm very happy with, but I use it to consume media and do some light web surfing, or my kids use it to play games. When I want to be productive and create content, I use my Chromebook as it is much better for that. I even spent some time using my Asus Transformer with the snap-on keyboard dock, and trust me the Chromebook is much more functional for productivity. A tablet wants to be a tablet and not some kludgy tablet/netbook combo, since the main benefit of a tablet is its portability and form factor.If you are thinking about buying a Chromebook, I recommend that you spend a couple of weeks seeing if you can do nearly everything you want on a Windows or Mac laptop using just the Chrome browser and no desktop applications. When you want to write documents or spreadsheets, use Google Docs, Microsoft Office Web Apps, Evernote Web, or equivalent. Use Gmail or other webmail program rather than Outlook. Use Picasa or Flickr or equivalent for your storing and editing images instead of keeping them on your hard drive. Stream music rather than playing MP3s from your hard drive. Use Google Talk instead of Skype. If you find yourself completely paranoid about where your data is being stored and whether or not you can get to it in case of calamity, then a Chromebook is not for you (conspiracy theorists are not the target market). If you find yourself constantly exiting the browser to open up a desktop application, then the Chromebook is not for you. But otherwise, I think you'll find that the world has evolved to a state where this is not only possible but easy and liberating to live on the web, and the Chromebook is a great vehicle for navigating this new world. Thin clients are the cutting edge of the future (maybe a bit too early for many people).Final thoughts - some things I hope Google/Samsung/Acer improve for future hardware / software releases:- Bluetooth support- Offline Google Docs editing - right now Google Docs are available for viewing offline and there are workarounds for offline editing like Scratchpad, but full offline editing and sync capability with  Google Docs would fix all these issues.- Just a little faster: The only noticeable performance issue is jerkiness when playing flash video at high bit rate. This should be fixed.- Price: I think the optimal price point is $50 less than current MSRP, making the Acer AC700 Wifi model $299, the Samsung Series 5 WiFi about $379, and the highest end model Samsung Series 5 with WiFi+3G about $450. Google and the OEMs should not try to cheapen it anymore than that, but rather they should play up the value for that price point. I bought my Samsung Series 5 Chromebook used on eBay for much less than MSRP, and I think I probably be less enthusiastic about it if I paid top dollar.A Skype web app would be nice too since even though Google Talk/Hangouts is just as good, not as many people use those services, but since Skype is now in Microsoft's hands I am not holding my breath.", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Solid Laptop, Almost There", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R72UOK46KFLSO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, this laptop is definitely not for everyone. The Chromebook will appeal most to the minimalist-loving, cloud based consumer. If you love a very swift boot time, mainly use your web browser, and trust the cloud then a Chromebook is the perfect choice.Design:The Samsung Series 5 has a sleek design and even comes with a cool chrome icon. Despite having a plastic feel, the laptop is well worth the $500 in terms of hardware. It weighs 3.3 lbs so its not too heavy, but also not the lightest laptop.Chrome OS:Chrome is Chrome OS. If you use chrome as a browser then you already know how this OS looks and performs. One plus to the Chrome OS though is that there are no application bars on the bottom of your screen and the media player, downloads, and various web apps minimize and disappear when you move away from them. This gives the OS a clean, clutter-less feel. Where the Chromebook really shines is its boot time. The Samsung Series 5 automatically starts up when you open the lid and within seconds, takes you to the login screen. At times, it feels less than 8 seconds.Web Apps:I haven't used too many web apps but most of them are bookmarks. I think in order for Chrome OS to be commercially successful, the web apps need to become of better quality. Since I rarely use web apps and almost never use programs like photoshop or dreamweaver, this is not an issue for me, but for users that require more from the web will frown upon this.Performance:The Samsung Series 5 performs how any dual-core atom processor would. Websites run fine, youtube videos at 360-480p run fairly smoothly (full-screen might have a different performance), and hulu runs at an average quality. Even having 5-6 tabs open won't hinder the performance of the laptop so it's quite capable. The keyboard is comfortable and has many useful shortcut keys. The trackpad is good, but does not compare to the mac trackpad. It does not support too many multi-touch gestures and scrolling is not as definitive as the macs.Overall:The Chromebook is capable of all casual browsing tasks such as social networking, watching online videos, listening to music, and basic document creation. In terms of performance I would have given the laptop 3-3.5 stars because the Chromebook does not do anything out of the ordinary and the price is not amazing. Yet I decided to give it 4 stars because of the rolling updates. Since Google constantly updates the Chromebook, with time, the computer is bound to get better. If you believe in Google's vision of the web and that they will fully back Chrome OS in the future, order a Chromebook now, but if you want a traditional laptop with all the standard features, stick with a similar priced pc or a macbook.", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Simple and elegant internet access point", "Author": "Saul Goode", "ReviewID": "R197FNXYDDD9Y3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: Instant on, 9 hour battery life, requires absolutely no maintenance, nice hardware, multiple user supportCons: Is only a web browser, limited offline-capable HTML5 apps currentlyI really like my Chromebook.

I basically needed something small and efficient for writing emails while on the go.  I have an iPad, but that doesn't fit the bill.  Tablets are great for consuming content, but not for generating it.  I've found that I almost exclusively use my tablet while sitting on the couch or while lying in bed at home.  For travel, I need a laptop.  I think that's funny, since tablets are supposed to be super mobile and ending the reign of the PC.Anyway, here's a brief list of pros and cons:PROS:- Perfect size- Lightweight- Simple and clean design- Battery lasts foreverrrr.  24 hours+ after opening and I'm still on the initial charge.  18% remaining.  It's the first notebook I've had that I can walk away from and forget about while it's on and unplugged without constantly thinking about how I shouldn't do that and I need to go plug it in.- It barely generates heat and makes *no* noise (my previous laptops were all 17\" beasts which did a lot of both)- Chrome OS is fun to play with and easy to useCONS:- Like Apple's laptops, the track pad is so large that I often hit it with my palm while typing.  Though the roominess of it is nice, that part is slightly annoying- The screen is nice and bright, but the contrast is weak, so light colors can be hard to see.  Chrome OS's text selection background color is very light, so often it's hard to tell what you're selecting- I would have loved to see a back-lit keyboard.  I think they missed an opportunity here to set that as a standard feature on Chromebooks.- There is no \"delete\" key!!!- I wish I could drag a tab from one window to another.  If it's possible, I haven't figured it out yet.- It's not a very fast machine.  It's good for light to medium work, but nothing heavy.- Tabs seem to get stuck while loading or crash after loading more often than they do in Chrome on Windows.  This is not to say that it happens often - it just happens *more* often than Chrome on Windows.- I wish there was a way to tab through panels like I can tab through tabs- Google's cloud services are all separate and dispersed.  (Picasa, Music Beta, Google Docs, etc.)  When I want to save a photo, it'd be nice if Google had their own unified cloud file system I could save it to if I wanted.  Like Dropbox or something.  I'd pay for that.  Right now I have to save the picture to the machine's HDD, then upload it to Picasa.  It'd be nice to not have to ever hit the local storage.  I know Google intends to make it so that you can add other internet services as cloud file systems that you can save to, but one branded as Google's would feel safer/more natural/better integrated.SUMMARY:I'm pretty satisfied with this little device.  It does exactly what I wanted it to, and I enjoy being part of the initial set of users on products, especially if it's something Googley.  The software I expect will be enhanced over time, and whatever issues remain outside of that are outweighed for me by the fun and sense of convenience that I get from playing with this thing.  I imagine though that it's not yet for everyone.  If you spend a good amount of your time offline, or using things other than a web browser, or don't want to be annoyed by the roughness around the edges of a new OS, you should probably stick with a PC or Mac for now, and maybe take another look this way in 6 months to a year.

I run my life on Google, multiple GMail accounts, Calendar, Sync for my mobile phones, Chrome syncs all my computers bookmarks etc., I've been a Google Voice user since it was Grand Central and Google Music beta actually let me sync my over 500GB music collection to their servers.As for the hardware, I've tried every tablet, (I currently have a GalaxyTab, an iPad, and a Playbook) but for the same reason I prefer my BlackBerry Bold over my iPhone is I need a keyboard, and the keyboard on the Chromebook is pretty good.

Read This Before Deciding ...", "Author": "Consumer Advocate", "ReviewID": "R2W4CDEWUPU8UQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Having spent some time comparing the Samsung and Acer, I found the Acer much better in the following areas:1. The Acer has removable battery that doesn't require you to disassemble your computer. There are 3, 6, and 9-cell capacity batteries to choose from. A fully charged one can be swapped in in seconds, just like ordinary notebook computers. The Samsung has a sealed battery inside (see ifixit.com) that cannot be replaced by anyone but Samsung. I cannot find a replacement battery for it on Ebay.2. The 2 Gb RAM in the Acer is removable, whereas the memory in the Samsung is SOLDERED in. In the event that it fails, you'd need to take it to Samsung for repair. You can imagine how much it will cost (parts + labor + shipping cost) compared to replacing the RAM yourself, not to mention lost time waiting. Because of this, ifixit only rated this Samsung's repairability at 6 out of 10.3. The Acer has a much better webcam at 1.3 Megapixels. Acer puts this excellent webcam, which it calls Crystal Eye, in almost all of its notebooks. It has excellent resolution and color fidelity. Samsung just says it has a 1 megapixel webcam and there is no further information that can be found.4. The Acer has HDMI output so your Chromebook can be connected to a large screen TV for viewing. The HDMI interface carries both audio and video signals in digital format. The Samsung just has an analog VGA connector, which is for video only! You need to run another cable for audio. Give me a break! I cannot understand why Samsung would put in this archaic interface on an advanced notebook like this in 2011!5. The Acer has a better a display at 1366 X 768 resolution (true 16:9 aspect ratio), compared to Samsung's 1280 X 800.In addition, you can read all the reviews on the Internet and watch YouTube videos comparing the two. Most agree that the Acer is superior and at a lower price ($299 for Wi-Fi, or $399 for Wi-Fi + 3G). Nonetheless, very few pointed out the fact about the Samsung's non-user-serviceable battery and memory, or the superiority of Acer's HDMI connector over the Samsung's VGA connector.Update:For the technically inclined, you can get something very similar to the Chromebook by running the Chrome OS on a USB stick with your PC or Mac. Just search for \"chrome os lime\" on Google. It requires downloading the Chrome OS image and burning it onto the USB drive using an image writer. It's not difficult. The boot time is about 15 seconds and the entire computer runs really fast, not as good as a Chromebook, but pretty close, and it's free! You should also know that Chrome OS Lime is updated DAILY and its compatibility is very computer brand and model specific. Even with BIOS that has \"boot from USB\" capability, computers older than two or three years probably can't run. If you have Compaq CQ62-423NR, I can tell you that Lime works (sound, touchpad, Adobe Flash, Wi-Fi, webcam, etc.).If you want to easily track your interests on the Internet on a daily basis, I'd suggest yourversion.com. It will track each keyword that you specify, for example, \"chrome os\", and it will present the latest info about it in a list of websites. It's more convenient than Google search.

I have read reviews on here saying that people do not like it since it does not have a dvd/cdrom or because it is not like a laptop. I just want to say to those people, DUH! This Chromebook is strictly for going on the internet. If you like listening to cds or watching dvds on a laptop type of computer, then this is NOT the item for you. If you want to go on the internet, do research, or chat online, then this is the item for you.It is simple, sleek, lightweight, and something that you can easily toss into your bag for travel. I have the Wifi version, and I absolutely love it. I can use it at home, or I can go to the coffee shop around the corner and connect there without having to worry about someone stealing my info or having to worry about getting a virus from using an open Wifi connection.The keyboard is comfortable, and I haven't even noticed that the CAPS key has been replaced by a search key. If you want or need CAPS, then just hold down the shift key, its that simple. The mousepad is large, comfortable, and very easy to use. It is very sensitive, and the lightest touch will have the curson/arrow moving on the screen. It moves with the pad of your finger, or even with your knuckle.For those who like to play games on the internet, like pogo.com, there is a bit of a problem and that is that the Chromebook does not support Java, and I dont know if it ever will. That is the only downfall I have had with the Chromebook.I use this for hours while sitting in bed, or sitting on the couch and it is amazing how cool is stays. I had a laptop and it got so hot on my legs I couldnt stand it. Even sitting with a pillow on my lap, the heat from the laptop would go through the pillow and still bother my legs. So this Chromebook is wonderfully built, it gets a tiny bit warm, but nothing that is uncomfortable, and this is over the period of hours.The battery life is amazing, I only have to charge it every other day, if that often. Depending on how much I use it, it is absolutely amazing! I don't know how they did it, but this battery is what people wish for on their laptops. 8+ hours in a single charge? Its amazing!Now, for the speed of things on the Chromebook, I have been using my Chromebook for about 2 weeks now and it does searches fast, pages open faster than they do on my Dell desktop, and I think that is because there is no virus software that slows down this type of computer. On a desktop there are so many different programs running in the background that NEED to be running in the background, and it really messes up the speed of things. On any Chromebook there is no need for virus software, or any of that other junk, and it makes a world of difference.The start up time is also as fast as they say. Each time I turn it on, I time it, and its always 8 seconds, how cool is that?!?!Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who likes something that is portable, lightweight, and easily connects to the internet. If you do not need a big computer or a heavy laptop, then this would be the option for you. If you have kids heading off to college and you don't want them to have an expensive computer/laptop that someone might steal or they might lose, then this would be the perfect option for them. And if it does gets lost, all their info is stored online, not on the hard drive. Older people can connect to the internet with no problem, and this is also good for people who like lounging around their house. Do you ever want to be on the internet, but not stuck behind the desktop all day? Or want to enjoy the beautiful weather outside, but need to get some work done on the internet?

Additionally, one of the best perks offered is that since it's all on the cloud, you're less likely to lose work and the computer itself is less susceptible to viruses with its own system of handling malware.While the Chromebook may seem a horrible choice for those who require heavy-load applications like Microsoft Office and perhaps games and so on, if you need a quickly accessible tool for on-the-go work, the Chromebook is a nice option.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Chromebook Shines as a Cutting-Edge Road Warrior and Leanback Laptop", "Author": "John J. Blossom \"John Blossom\"", "ReviewID": "R3FYRJLY04VPXT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you're looking at a Chromebook seriously for purchasing, chances are you're a person who uses the Web for almost all of their computing needs already. You surf it, you listen to it, you watch videos on it, you chat on it, you probably read and write your email on it, you may even write and store your documents on it and keep your business' books on it. In other words, if you're wondering what it is that you really need a PC or Mac laptop for besides the Web, Chromebook's answer is, \"Good question.\" The Samsung Chromebook runs Google's brand-new Chrome OS operating system, which is an ultra-fast and light operating system that delivers everything that the Chrome browser does, plus just enough beyond that to get you connected to the wireless Web, your USB and SD card storage devices and, if you're so inclined, an external VGA monitor and USB keyboard and mouse. And that's it.Whoa, so, you mean, we're really not going to be able to use software from our PCs? Yep, that's the deal - though many of your favorite programs already have versions available in \"the cloud\" of Internet sites that provide software that works in your Web browser and stores your files in \"the cloud\" of computers chugging along in well-run data centers where they do things like backups regularly and take care of the equipment well. Compare that to the typical laptop users' experience with crashes that leave files in never-never land and you can see why many people are eager to leave the heavy lifting of computing to the pros out there on the Web.What you get for leaving the world of PCs and Macs behind is a computer that has little of the baggage associated with them, which means that the relatively light Chromebook can run lean, fast and efficiently where PCs and Macs would struggle. Configuring a Chromebook is ultra-simple; take it out of the box, turn it on, log in with a Google account (or make one for free), set up a connection to your wireless network or to the optional Verizon 3G wireless plan, and you're done. After that, when you turn it on it will take all of 8 seconds to get a login prompt and just a couple of seconds after that to get to being productive on the Web. Forever. That's right, instead of having a super-fast PC day one that turns to mush as soon as you start loading - and breaking - software and files, Chrome OS stays fresh as a daisy every day, getting automatic updates to its relatively small footprint on your machine. Should you lose or break your Chromebook and have to get a new one or borrow someone else's, no sweat - your new machine running Chrome OS will be just like your old one in seconds. That's a huge plus, also meaning that the ease of migration to newer units will keep hardware vendors competing to give you faster, better and cheaper units, since there aren't files or installed software to keep you invested in the hardware running Chrome OS.So what is this cloud machine like to use? The Samsung Series 5 Chromebook is a great machine physically. At 3.3 pounds, it's a light laptop, certainly heavier than today's tablet/pad computers but having the advantage of hands-free viewing and reading. I like tablets, but I don't think that you give up much of their convenience with a Chromebook, while getting the efficiency and productivity of a full-size keyboard and Web browser. Battery life is superb, enabling up to 8.5 hours of use in typical conditions. While it's not quite as heavy-duty as some popular high-end laptops, it has a really solid feel in spite of being a very light unit. The 12.1-inch display is very bright, providing a very crisp and readable display even in bright direct sunlight. The oversize touchpad is very nice, making it easy to use it from almost any hand angle. There is a built-in mike and a built in 1MB webcam also can take snapshots. There is a place to plug in a combo mike/headphone headset, so you can slide over your earbuds from your phone easily. You get two USB ports, one behind a cover which also protects a mini-VGA port, a very compact power supply for charging and plugged-in use, and another covered bay that conceals a SIM card for your carrier's optional 3G service. Also included in the box is a short cable that provides a standard VGA connector for the mini-VGA port, so that you can plug in a monitor or computer projector easily. No, not an HDMI port, though I understand the Acer unit will have one. A \"developers mode\" switch lets you get at the guts of the unit if you're so inclined to tweak it or to install a different operating system.Okay, so you've logged in to your Chromebook. What's it like to use it? Well, if you've used Google's Chrome web browser for PCs, Macs and other machines, then you're already doing pretty much everything that you can do on a Chromebook. Except for some icons in the upper right corner of the display  for time, network connection bars and battery life, what you see is the Web via Chrome. Unlike other Web  browsers, Chrome was built for this moment from its first debut. Each browser tab that you open is in effect a separate, secure program with no ability to mess up your disk or your other tabs. If something crashes in one browser tab, it won't affect content or software in other tabs. On a PC, this means that you have a browser that won't mess with your PC and runs very efficiently. Without a PC's baggage, it means that you have pretty much the safest and fastest way to create and consume Web content.Chrome provides easy access to \"Web applications,\" software that runs in a Web browser. For example, Google Docs, a Web site that enables you to create and store Web documents, is software that runs on any browser, including Chrome. For Chrome, key Google Web apps like Docs are being tweaked to enable their use when you're not connected to the Internet, and the latest version of Web standards for programming browser apps - HTML 5 - enables anyone to do likewise and many have made offline-capable Web apps already. One of the things that we can expect to see as the result of Chrome OS are more Web apps that take advantage of this capability. In the meantime, by default every newly opened browser tab in Chrome provides access to the Chrome Web Store, a Web site that makes it easy to find the thousands of Web apps that can make using a Chromebook a pleasant and productive experience.Popular Web apps in the Chrome Web Store include the Angry Birds game, which works very smoothly, Google Docs, the Evernote document creator, Aviary photo editing and specially designed versions of Sports Illustrated and The New York Times. Most of these are free apps, though some may require payment to access premium content and features. There are also many, many Web apps and highly functional or entertaining Web sites that aren't in the Chrome Web store that will work just fine in Chrome. This is, after all, the Web itself, with the Chrome Web Store playing the role of Web app showcasing. You can even use Microsoft's free Office Web Apps app to create and edit documents in a Web version of Word, Excel or Powerpoint.A Chromebook performs quite well, considering that its guts are based on an Intel Atom N570 dual core processor, a very good CPU but not a high-end unit. The Chromebook comes with 2GB of memory and 16GB of storage, which can be used to tuck away files downloaded from the Web or from your own media. In general this configuration works very well in everyday use. Since all Chrome OS does is run Chrome and a few simple hardware devices inside the Chromebook, most of its memory and processing power gets focused on the browser. What this means is that most browsing experiences are about the same as you'd expect to experience in a much more powerful laptop. Videos tend to chug a little bit at times, although an optional setting that makes use of the Chromebook's graphics processor more efficiently tends to make them run more smoothly. You can have lots and lots of tabs open in Chrome before you'll see any noticeable performance lag in most instances.The good news on performance is that we're in the very early days of high-power Web apps, with both Google and others working hard to improve their performance. New capabilities being readied for Chrome such as Native Client processing will enable more complex Web programs and graphics to run much more quickly. Chrome OS itself is being tweaked constantly, so that eight-second login is likely to get better, not worse, as time goes on. In the meantime, the relatively light processor driving Chrome OS on the Chromebook enables low power consumption with little heat, meaning super-long battery life and very little heat. The unit's cooling fan is very quiet and pushes out a whisper of heat, as opposed to the hairdryer-like blast coming out of many laptops.For those who have files that they want to use or to upload while using the Chromebook, the SD card bay and USB ports offer you the ability to take them with you. Using files on a Chromebook is not an ideal experience yet. When you pop in a USB drive or SD card, you get a pretty simple file manager interface, which can provide thumbnail previews of graphics files. There's a fairly limited range of file types that you can open and use on a Chromebook, since it relies on Web-based software, though most file types can be uploaded to services on the Web that can open then for use. A built-in media player can show photos or videos and play tunes, but it's not much to look at and the features are minimal. A nice plus for the file manager, though, is simplified uploading of photos and videos to the Picasaweb image sharing site. You can slide in your camera's SD card, choose or create a Picasaweb folder, and push them up to the Web quickly for private or public viewing.All of Chrome OS' pop-up windows appear as panes docked to the bottom of the browser display, unlike the PC version of Chrome, which allows for pop-up windows to appear and move anywhere on the display and even to move tabs in Chrome to new windows. This is kind of annoying at times, since it's less flexible, but for many functions it turns out to be quite practical. For example, if a Web site opened up a popup window of text or a form, you can minimize it to the bottom of the display and then pull it up quickly without having to wonder where it is.The other major \"oh, that's different\" aspect of the Chromebook is the keyboard and touchpad. Most of the keys on the Chromebook keyboard look the same, but you'll see many that just aren't there and some that are different. For example, instead of a Caps Lock key you'll see a Search key (you can set it to be Caps Lock instead if you want). There's no Delete key, though you can press Alt-Backspace to get the same effect. The top row of function keys have browser-specific functions mostly, plus keys for display brightness and sound control. Once you get used to how to use the Ctrl and Alt keys to get some of the typical extra keystrokes on a standard keyboard, it's basically the same as any other. For that tradeoff in total keys you get full-size keys that are easier to stroke on a very comfortable keyboard. That's something that most notebook computers of this size just cannot claim. If you plug in a standard keyboard, the Chromebook will adopt to its layout, though some of the PC-oriented function keys won't work.Probably the least developed feature on the Chromebook is its webcam. It works well enough for services like Gtalk and other Web-based video chat services, and you can use it to record YouTube videos, but that's about it. The camera itself is pretty decent, though, so probably the software available for it will make it more useful soon enough. Other minuses include a battery that cannot be removed without opening up the unit and non-upgradeable memory - you're stuck with 2GB, decent enough as that is. But for a unit at this price point, those aren't unusual compromises. The optional Verizon 3G mobile data plan for U.S. purchasers includes 100MB of data a month for two years. You can barely blow your nose on the Web with 100MB these days, but as a backup to wifi or a mobile phone equipped with a wifi hotspot, it's very cheap signal coverage insurance. Apparently you can slip in data SIM cards for other mobile carrier networks, but I haven't tried this yet.Missing from the unit altogether is support for Bluetooth devices. I don't consider that a hardship, especially since it's typically an extra drain on battery life, but some might consider that a minus. With the rise of Wi-Fi Direct communications, which work pretty much like Bluetooth but use standard wifi communications with virtually no setup hassle, I think that we'll be seeing less of Bluetooth devices in the future. Still in the wings is access to files on Android mobile devices, which connect to the Chromebook via a USB cable but don't yet allow file access.You can print pages and documents on the Chromebook via Google's Cloud Print service. When this is set up,you can sent print jobs to a printer connected to a PC set up for Cloud Printing services. Cloud Print can send print jobs directly to printers that use the ePrint wifi printing communications standard, but so far only a handful of HP printers set up for ePrint work with Cloud Print. I tried Cloud Print from my Chromebook through my PC's printer and it worked fine, though given the balky nature of router and wifi printer connections, I wouldn't bet my life on it working from afar.There are also versions of the Chromebook available to academic institutions and businesses at monthly service pricing, which includes an administrative console software package. Presumably the console feature will allow a not particularly techie central administrator to enable or disable features and logins remotely for their Chromebook users. Institutions may also be interested in PC desktop software emulators being readied for Chrome OS, giving you the ability to use PC software remotely via a Chrome browser window.The bottom line is that if you're using the Web for virtually everything already, have regular contact with good wifi and wireless data connections and you're looking to leave PCs behind (or never wanted one in the first place), a Chromebook may be right for you. You may think that you'll use it as a backup device, relying on your PC or Mac to do your everyday \"heavy lifting.\" And if you're using heavy duty software like professional video and photo editors, high-power document layouts and fonts or gotta-have-the-software services like Skype, then that may be the case. But if my own experience and the experience of other early Chrome OS adapters is any guide, you'll be finding every excuse you can to make your Chromebook your \"plan A\" machine. Its fast startup, near-zero virus hassles, ease of use, light form factor, amazing battery life and ease of use make it a real pleasure to use for all but the most software-heavy applications. Key offline apps for productivity are coming soon, as are better device interfaces, and Chrome OS in general is forcing Web apps to get better. Chromebooks are ready for a Web that's getting better and more powerful by the day. Best of all, Chromebooks are pretty future-proof. As the Chrome OS software gets better and as Web software gets better, its performance will get better, without a stitch or work or investment on your side. And when that inevitable moment comes when it's time to get the next shiny new Chrome-equipped machine, all you'll have to do to get there is to log in to it; say goodbye to all of the new-machine headaches that were part of the PC world.Is it a bit of a walk on the wild side to use a Chromebook? Yeah, sure. This is a machine with a brand-new operating system, after all, not to mention a whole new way of looking at how computers and the Web can work together. But in truth most of us are ahead of the PC and Mac world already. We're already on the Web almost all the time, using software reluctantly or out of necessity. So in a sense using a Chromebook is telling the computer world to get with the program and to support the Web the way that it was meant to be supported. But in the meantime, what you get is the Web, nothing but the Web (plus some files, if you must), anywhere, any time, the way that it was meant to be. My guess is that you'll be plenty happy almost all of the time with just that.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Avoid the Chromebook! - 6 month's experience and I totally regret my purchase.", "Author": "ozob", "ReviewID": "R3D4CRWUEPBMUY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you think tech support is frustrating with Windows, wait until you deal with Samsung, HP (for the cloud printer) and Google.The concept is great but this is NOT ready for the public.

Do you complain that an wireless tablet doesn't have an ethernet port? Of course not.Comparison:After switching to Apple products a few years ago, my standard of quality and ease of use changed greatly. This is no MacBook Pro/Air or even an iPad but it does have flash which was my wife's biggest complaint with our iPad/iPhones. At first the low framerate of flash video was horrible and it made watching videos choppy and unwatchable.

Granted, ctrl-alt-del is not necessary for Chrome OS, but she still wants to be able to delete text after the cursor.Another difficulty that I hope to find a work around for is I can't get the chromebook to access my external hard drive plugged into my router.

I know that there are keyboard combinations for these, but a long-term power user will find this frustrating (I know I do).  I don't miss the F-keys they removed, but they should not have eliminated the navigation keys. If you never use these keys, you will not miss them.Google has recently introduced a desktop-style interface on their Beta channel which I think is a step backward.

Keys that were normally hidden on other laptop keyboards like volume and screen brightness are front and center on the chromebook.  I highly suggest learning the other keyboard shortcuts, ctrl+alt+? to see them all displayed.The mouse was more disappointing, again I am very proficient with the trackpad on laptops and I have been troubled by the chromebook's oversized pad.  The pad is so large that I find it difficult to only rest my index finger and thumb on the pad.  I have to stretch or hold out my other three fingers so they don't touch the pad.  Whenever they do, watch out, the mouse pointer goes crazy!  Don't get me started on the twister style maneuver you have to perform to right click.Other Thoughts:I would compare the chromebook's performance with a netbook, the samsung chromebook beats the pants off the netbooks I have seen.  There are two things that I cannot do on my chromebook, play angrybirds HD and play youtube HD.  If you are ok with angrybirds SD and youtube 480p, this is your powerhouse.Conclusion:Over all, I really do like the chromeOS. I do wish there were a few more user options, like leave the system on with the lid closed or adjust the idle time to sleep (annoying when listening to music).Google promises offline doc apps and tighter google app integration coming this summer, so I have something to look forward to.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Did not meet expectations", "Author": "Daniel Genzink", "ReviewID": "R13K66QOVBUDR0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I love gmail, chrome, and everything google does. Knowing that I was purchasing a machine that focused completely around chrome, I'm just a tad letdown.Here are just some observations while using the product over the past week.Hardware: the size and weight is great. inputs and outputs are adequate. However, for a machine that \"gets better over time\" as google advertises, the hardware may be limiting. It's a solid casing, so there's no way to install a new battery or carry an extra one for backup. Also, it's a standard plug from the power cord to the computer (not magnetic), so that will ware out over time, especially if you're trying to get the most out of the battery by unplugging it when it's completely charged.Some people have mentioned that there is no caps lock key, but that's not a big deal. (who uses that anyway?) The only key I miss is the Delete key, for when I want to delete characters in-front of the cursor.streaming video: I watch mlb.tv and other live sports online and it works quite well.web browsing: I'll have 3 or 4 tabs open and 3 or 4 extensions running (google voice, google talk, scratch pad) and I'll get a notification that one of the extensions has crashed or I'll get that \"he's dead jim\" blue screen when a chrome web page crashes. This is happening about 2 or more times a day.File management: I plugged in a usb thumb drive with a bunch of different files and it only recognized pictures. So, I couldn't open up a word doc directly from the thumb drive; you have to go to google docs and then open it from there. I also can't find web app that will play avi video files from the thumb drive.Battery: as we all know, the battery life is great. When the battery is dead and you begin charging, it says it will take about 3 hours to charge. However, even when the computer is completely powered down, the final \"20 minutes\" takes a little over an hour, so it's about 3.5 hours for a charge. Because I watch a lot of video, I'm not sure how long it lasts for normal use, but right now it says the battery has 4% left and 2 hrs; this makes no sense.Processing power: If this is a machine that is supposed to get better over time, I believe the processing power will be the limiting factor. Having an HD sports program in the background while doing something else isn't the smoothest of operations. As apps become more advanced in the future and need more processing power, I'm not sure how the chromebook will hold up.That being said, if you want the portability, long battery life, and quick access to the web, this is a great machine.Let me know if you have any questions by leaving a comment.Thanks!Dan.", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER -- It is a SCAM!", "Author": "Richard Cappadona", "ReviewID": "R1U5FWHKPCAH8Z", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "THIS SELLER (\"CRAVING SAVINGS\") IS A SCAM!!!

It feels solid, not cheap.The screen is excellent - clear, matte and bright.The keyboard is also superb, and a pleasure to work on.The trackpad isn't as good - I found myself wanting to use a mouse, though I've not tested one yet with the Chromebook.The lack of Bluetooth functionality is a bit annoying, especially if you'd prefer to use a wireless mouse.The initial setup takes between 10 and 15 minutes, including setting up Verizon's free 100Mb per month. That process was clumsy and annoying, and I find the data prices to be slightly absurd. I already pay $35 a month for data on my iPad, and I feel like I should be able to share this data with my Chromebook.Once everything has been setup, the startup time is incredibly fast; less than 5 seconds the first time in after setup.Everything feels fast and effective, and it is odd not having a desktop but just a browser window.I use Chrome on all other platforms, so it feels very natural here. I use Google Docs a lot, having published 3 books using it as a collaborative tool. The Series 5 handles those online apps with ease.The Series 5 feels like a laptop, not a netbook. The form factor is just the right size to get some work done, as long as you have an internet connection (since the free 100mb a month doesn't really amount to much). I would use this over the iPad to get work done on the go, though the iPad is obviously a more versatile device. If I was traveling for a couple of days, I might bring the Series 5 instead of my 13\" Macbook Pro, though only if I didn't intend to get any \"heavy\" work done.All-in-all a solid start to the Chromebook line. If you're looking for a simple, uncomplicated device for web browsing and some light work (though increasingly more serious work can be done via Google docs), then you might want to think about a Chromebook and in particular, the Samsung Series 5. It's a solid device for a frequent traveler, as long as you're willing to pay the premium for Verizon's 3G internet.

First, I am a test pilot user and find the product refreshing and highly useful. But I just dont know why Google didnt go ahead and offer a tablet version and 2 or 3 netbook versions (a wifi and a 3g, which should be a 4g) instead of the 5 netbook versions? People want tablets! Besides, it would do what android tablets havent been able to do. Also, android and its marketplace are at a critical junction with the fragmentation that is occurring, sure to cause consternation both in the consumer and the developer world, as its lifespan continues.Most important for Chrome OS survivability is the fact that web and software developers will have to tailor and support their programs for Chrome, which will take a while but undeniably will happen, once the popularity of the OS and cloud computing usage in general increases, but first a price drop for these devices; Google must get them into the hands of everyone with a couple of extra dollars in their pockets and the desire to find a new OS (which there are many of), even if it means doing it at a loss (see: the kindle). Eventually Google is going to run into the classic \"guns versus butter\" quandary with all its operating systems out there. Ill place my money on its ONLY TRUE OPEN OS, the Chrome OS (android is by invite only until Google decides to release version's source code). Chrome is more than just a browser, any browsing on goggle labs will convince you of that! So why not capitalize on its unified design/operating concept and install it as an OS? This is what many people dont \"get about Chrome as an OS, the say \"I have chrome on my computer already\"...in a few years pretty much all of your operations will exist in/on the cloud.SOME GOOD:  All of the chromebooks weigh in at about 3lbs, or twice the wight of the ipad2, which is still very light. Also, battery life is pretty identical to the advertised specs.  Boot time is ridiculously fast, less than 10 secs from a dead sleep! Amazon's cloud player is integrated very, very nicely integrated. Most important Chrome OS function: you DONT have to pay for web applications as you do with iOS or Android OS (unless site owners wish to charge for content, that is).SOME BAD:  No HDMI but a VGA instead (yeah, I know, its 2011). No bluetooth, NO GPS, webcam issues, cant use USB drives...most of the issues (I did not list several others) can be patched through updates. However some are hardware and will need to be addressed next production run or model design.  I recommend any of the SAMSUNG chromebooks w/the dual core Atom n570 cpu.The cpu will cut down significantly on streaming video stuttering that the acer chromebook will see (only the acer wifi only version has the N570, but a smaller screen though; as of June 2011 pay the few extra dollars and get the Samsung 3g unit...  On a final note: I almost wish I hadnt bought my ipad2, but I got tired of waiting for the chromebook to release and needed a portable computing device(I dont use windows netbook/laptops or Mac's. I will however grudgingly settle for chrome on a netbook). I suppose now  I can now wait for chrome OS to be released on a tablet before letting go of the ipad; hopefully a Chrome OS tablet will come before xmas.", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Both and hardware and software needs more work", "Author": "Bhaumin Shah", "ReviewID": "R1B2SUSQ26ZZW3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Was not satisfied with the hardware as well as software:-Some of the keys did not work perfectly (h,m).

Fast \"cold\" startup, true. It's up and running in less than 10 seconds, as advertised. Wakes up/resumes instantly, true. Again, as advertised. Cloud connected, true. Awesome battery life, true. Slick design, true. So, why did I give a pitiful two-star rating you ask? Three main reasons:1. Price/Value2. Connectivity3. Utility1. In as neat as these devices are, for what they do and the features it offers, it's grossly overpriced. You can get the more functionality, MUCH better performance, many more features from a \"conventional\" laptop for just about the same price.2. Google's vision of cloud-connected devices falls apart if you are in a place where connectivity is not possible or simply unaffordable. In-flight or out in the boondocks, for instance. With this device no connection means you have a glorified brick in your hands.3. This is where I think all boils down to. What does this computer do (disregarding Google's marketing and hype)? It's an internet terminal ... and that's it. It will not edit your videos, it doesn't run Photoshop, it doesn't run any local games (or Steam, for that matter), you can't install any of your favorite content authoring software, can't play CDs/DVDs, doesn't have family censorship tools and let's not even talk about how utterly useless this device is for those in the software development field. And all that would be perfectly fine if point 1 and 2 above weren't there. If this machine were, say, $150 the tradeoffs would make perfect sense. You're trading usability/utility for an inexpensive device. But at current prices, it's simply not worth it. Too many alternatives, too many limitations. In essence you are paying a few hundred dollars for a Chrome web browser (which, by the way, can be FREELY downloaded and installed on just about ANY computer).My, so-called TL;DR: Neat machine, poor utility, poor value.", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great if you are always on.

The worst is the trackpad, and I'm not sure how much of this is software or hardware/driver but it is absolutely terrible.

I've bought  a number of Netbooks over the years and felt they were starting to be a nice device - so I had high hopes for this.But it feels heavier than I expected, there's no keyboard back-light, and the body, especially around the screen hinge is cheap snap-to plastic.

Even my $275 Acer netbooks had tap to click.And I can't imagine this holding up for 3 years with a junior high student.And Chrome OS is Chrome - there's not much more to it (file explorer).
