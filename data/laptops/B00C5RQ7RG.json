{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Buyer Beware - Toshiba Laptop Warranty Issues", "Author": "Rater McRaterson", "ReviewID": "R3MCCJDKDT96TQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is a general Toshiba policy review that applies to all Toshiba machines. As of this date, Toshiba will not cover the $25 shipping of their defective product to them on items in full warranty, unlike Lenovo and HP. You think you are buying a more reliable machine, but the more expensive Toshiba, like other brands, had a hardware failure within 3 months. The phone system is ridiculous. I have dealt with HP and Lenovo warranty and by far, Lenovo has been the easiest to deal with when you have a problem. (HP was not difficult, just not as much of a breeze as Lenovo (IBM). For these reasons, I would never buy another or recommend Toshiba. Even though the customer service of JD was excellent, I would still not recommend purchasing anything from Toshiba in the future. It is not the industry standard and even though I explained this, they would not waive the shipping charge. Apparently, they did not care and it was a common complaint. Feel free to share and let others know. An informed buyer is a powerful thing.  #Toshiba This machine is actually quite nice, it is a shame. I realize this is a review location for the machine and not the company, but it is best to know what you are getting into with a company regardless of how cool the machine is. If this doesn't bother you, then you will have no problems.", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$539.99", "Features": "Windows 8\nMobile Intel HD graphics with shared graphics memory\n15.6\" diagonal widescreen TruBrite TFT\nIntel Core i5-3230M Processor\nConfigured with 6GB DDR3 1600MHz (max 16GB)", "Name": "Toshiba Satellite L855 15.6\" Laptop Computer, Intel Core i5-3230, 6GB Memory, 640GB Hard Drive", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41B7oou86zL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00C5RQ7RG"}}
