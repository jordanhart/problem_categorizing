I had bought a costlier dell few days back but comparing Dell with this product, i definitely can say that this is better.System boots very quickly.System fan doesn't make much sound.The webcam is good.Depth of the sound output is good.The laptop looks pretty sturdy.Keyboard is very soft and this is one thing that i am not sure whether it will have a problem in future. I have been using Mac book and the key board in mac is solid but lenovo's key doesn't. May be it is good or bad.

Hansen", "ReviewID": "R1PTT5J2Z1C5TQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "A laptop out of the box should work. Everything should work. With this one, that was not the case.The WiFi on mine was not working out of the box. How can a laptop be shipped from the factory with bad WiFi driver? How does that happen? So, after some basic troubleshooting, I gave up on the wireless, connected via an ethernet cable, and got the new driver from Lenovo's website. That solved the problem, at least for now.Once WiFi was working, I installed all the updates for Windows 8, then applied the Windows 8.1 update. And, guess what? The WiFi stopped working. Applying the same formula as before, I got the 8.1 WiFi driver from Lenovo's website, and installed them with the expectation that this would resolve the issue. It did not. After installing the new drivers, I still have no WiFi. No amount of driver cleanup, WiFi profile deletions and \"Lenovo wireless driver\" uninstall would fix the issue.After reading through several pages of posts on Lenovo's support forum, I found the fix that worked for me: Download and installed the Windows 8.0 WiFi driver (and not the 8.1 driver). Once this driver was installed, the WiFi came to life.Considering the amount of traffic this particular topic on the support forum seems to be getting, how come Lenovo can't solve the issue? If the 8.1 driver is bad, why is it still listed on their website?", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Value!", "Author": "yankeelady", "ReviewID": "R3EK0M9VBHQSUH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good, sturdy laptop  for the price.

However, if you are looking for a computer to get the job done at home or at work and not break the bank, then this might be a good fit.One benefit that I liked was the keyboard. The keys are raised nicely and give a good response when I type. Also, I am notorious for bumping track pads when I type, and that has not happened as often with this device. It has a dedicated numpad section to the right, so that is nice if you are typing a bunch of numbers.It is also nice because it has an optical disk drive. Many of the less expensive computers I looked at did not have one to save space and money, which means I would need to buy a separate drive, and thus you become slightly less portable.It was fast enough to run my favorite game, Lord of the Rings Online, using DirectX 10 at high settings (my Asus can run it on ultra high and everything turned up, but it was also 3 times as expensive.)A drawback to it is that it contains Windows 8 and is not a touch screen. I have Windows 8 on a tablet and its fine, but without a touch screen I am not as big a fan. It is a little harder to navigate this way and the benefit of Windows 8 is lost on a nontouch screen.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Whiners", "Author": "thurman fionn", "ReviewID": "RHM5Q8DYT34SW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everyone says that windows 8 is bad and I agree with them but the review section is for the review of the product not the software it runs.

About a week after the amazon return policy expired the screen on my laptop stopped working. I take great care of my belongings - my last computer lasted nearly 8 years before it became ungodly slow.

I am using it now as a matter of fact, but I wanted to upgrade and let my daughter use the old one.  I got the other and the period key never worked well had to be pressed hard and several times, I thought it might just have to be cleaned or broken in, but it never worked.  I returned it.I bought another through lenovo and it worked ok for a month (g510) and then it just went to white screen one day.  So that is out for repair.  Not sure what is up with Lenovo's quality these days, but make sure when you buy you get full warranty and maybe even damage warranty to be on the safe side.That all being said, Lenovo's customer service is pretty good thus far.  They offered to take and fix both laptops.  The first one I just returned to Amazon (again great customer service), the second one I bought directly from Lenovo because they were the only one's selling it, and so they sent me a fedex return box and they paid for shipping.  I packed it up called Fed Ex and they picked up later the same day.  It has been delivered to Lenovo at this time, and I am waiting to hear back from the service department with respect to what is wrong with it and if and when it will be fixed.  I just hope they don't try to stick me with a bill, as the computer was only one month old, never dropped or manhandled in anyway and it has to be a motherboard or screen issue that was defective from the get go.

This particular computer is giving me many troubles. It is too complicated. To use the computer I must read a manual that comes with the computer if not I won't be able to use the computer. It is not fear. I really don't have the time to start reading manuals to work with a computer after more than 20 year using computers simply because Windows 8 now is too complicated trying to imitate Apple. The keyboard is not efficient. it is impossible to type quickly because it will miss letters. While I am using the computer  all kind of advertisements interrupt me even if I am in internet or not. Every window you want to open and use for first time you must give an email and password first. I am really getting sick and tired of using this computer.  I just want to know if I still have the chance to return the computer and change it back to a Window 7. Otherwise I will send the computer to change Windows 8 to 7.. the service will cost me $140.
