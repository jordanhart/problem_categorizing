It was easy to setup and configure and I must say this Dell Inspiron i7-2670qm 15R is an outstanding notebook for the price.  This machine has excellent performance. It's fast with a great display and keyboard w/number pad and includes features like HDMI, two USB 3.0, and eSATA connectors.  The i7 quad processor ranks about 89 on the highend cpu benchmark scale making this a great value since notebooks like this one can sale for upwards of $1,000.  If you are looking for a good laptop for under $600, this one's outstanding.", "Date": "August 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome if you upgrade the hard drive but...", "Author": "CyberChicken", "ReviewID": "R1NLSL4FFUTDJX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently purschased this laptop with the $590 deal and for that price I can tell you it was a great buy. I like to take my time when buying computer components because since I live in M\u00e9xico is not as ez as many of you to return an item if it comes dented, scratched or fails on the first days after purschase because at that time I'd probably back from the US (Amazon is the best thing ever I think)...so I was looking for a laptop that fulfills my high requirements since I am a programmer and a gamer to get the best performance for the best price, in this case it will be mainly for programming over gaming, so my first priority was processor because that is something you'll live with the rest of your laptop's life, then the RAM Memory which can be upgradable at anytime, graphics (HDMI port), screen size and the last thing I care about is hdd capacity (just use an external hdd for data).This laptop comes with i7 which means that you are getting 4 cores in contrast to the i5 that are 2 cores and that represents great performance in multitasking and hard processing in long runs even when you get faster frequencies with 2 cores, I recommend you to go to the cpubenchamarks page which can help you to have an overview and ranking performance of the cpu model you are looking for, when buying a laptop be careful of those advertisements deals of some AMD processors that are 3-4 cores that don't perform as Intels i3-i5 because sometimes the Intel performs better even with 2 cores.Now, RAM memory is upgradable to 8 GB and for starting with 6GB is good and you save a bit here to later buy 2x4GB sticks same brand because when I opened it I noticed it came with 2 different brands.So far the other features were good for me except for the hard drive, it is 500GB - 5400rpm which is a speedbump for the processor, so without awaiting to see how the HDD would perform and before I got the laptop I ordered a 128GB SSD (Samsung 830 series because of its reliability and rankings) and I know the big difference it would make. The performance before the SSD was really noticeable as expected after I installed it, the SSD was 2.5x faster that the HDD and now it easily boots in 13 - 16 seconds average, consider here that I installed a fresh instance of Windows 7 x64 Ultimate so no preinstalled Dell software that could slow down my boot time. The really bad news here are that if you want to upgrade the HDD for a SSD you'll need to literally dismantle your laptop in order to do that (I was not aware of that until the moment) so I took the risk in its brand new state and it wasn't so hard for me since I am an Engineer in Computer Systems but anyone can do it because it's pretty straightforward, all is just remove screws (during the procedure I highly recommend using antistatic wrist strap). Thanks to some tutorials I found in youtube I was able to do it with no problems but I sweated during the process (j/k) hoping I wouldn't break anything (plastics). At the end I did the system rating test and the graphics were the low ranked that determined the rating which I don't care much since I can run HD Videos, I think it has the Intel HD Graphics 3000 which is the most common, anyways If I want to play video games I just have to seat on my desktop with EVGA GTX 560 TI FTW.

I've noticed a few problems within the first two weeks.The Good:For the price. Decent processor, RAM, HD size and screen size.Seems well built.  Doesn't have the flimsy plastic feel where I'm afraid to carry it around.  The battery isn't anything to marvel at.  I ran max power settings running virtual machines for small projects.  Two and a half hours so far.  It's light (comparatively to the class of laptop; it's not a Mac Air)Intel Centrino Wireless N 1030 - The onboard wifi/bluetooth card is in serious need of software driver work.  After doing a bit of research I found that I was not the only person with the same wifi problems.  Recently Intel has provided an update (go to Intel website) which fixed most of the problems (i.e. consist disconnections to wifi).  Now I only have problems with connections to 802.11g network connections. 802.11n network connections don't seem to be a problem.Secondly, I spilled a e-cigarette liquid on the keyboard and tried to clean under the keys which were sticky (random keys were sticking). Bad idea. Laptop keyboards may not be meant for easy repair.  Luckily with Amazon Prime I had another keyboard shipped immediately.  Installation of the new keyboard took about 7 easy steps.  So no biggie.If you can get past the 802.11g driver problem this is a good purchase.  Luckily I have 802.11n networks available.Had I not had major problems with the wifi card I'd rate at 4 stars.", "Date": "February 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just ok", "Author": "C.

It's no huzzle and pretty fast setup.I hav'nt tested the speed yet, but comparing the systems speed of Dell Inspiron i15RN-5294BK with my office desktop Dell Optiflex Core i5-2400 3.1ghz 4GB, 250gb, which is a dual core 2nd gen it looks like that my new Inspiron Core i7-2670QM 2.2Ghz quad core 6GB RAM 500GB the Inspiron is faster than my desktop Optiflex 790.I got 5.8 WPI in my laptop while my Optiflex 790 in the office has only 5.1. I noticed later that WIN7 added Microsoft Signature on the power options and I was wandering how the systems speed appeared compared to power saver then I found an option to enable for High Performance. The system speed dramatically increases and I can compare now that this is more faster than the Dell desktop Core i5-2400 3.1ghz 4GB, 250gb.The Inspiron has Microsoft Essential Security antivirus with antispyware while the one in the office is Microsoft Forefront Client Security. I don't know if this has make a difference in terms of systems speed overall.Pros:I have not thoroughly benchmark the entire system but as far as the CPU Processor is concern, Intel\u00ae Core(tm) i7 2670QM was benchmark at ave. CPU mark @ 6780 while the Intel Core i5-2400 3.1ghz 2nd gen. is below at an ave. CPU mark of 6152. Bottom line, the entire system performance are affected based on mobo systems architecture design, graphics card, memory, HDD, etc.The keyboard with numeric pad are smooth to touch and easy to press. The mouse pad is smooth and I feel no hard surface unlike my older inspiron 1525 2.4ghz Core2duo is quite rough surface and need to press hard sometimes annoying.The temperature ave. at the exhaust is warm and the fan is quite.The sound is impressive and I heard the surround when I played the surround video movies. The video HD pictures is quite impressive and clear HD.I will post more later if I found something unusual. But so far it is an impressive piece. After knowing and enable the high performance power options, I can see clearly that this model is superior than the other model having closer range.Cons:1. I don't like the LAN, power, & USB 3.0 ports were located on the rear. I cannot turn the bottoms up 90deg. and lay the display lid on the bed in case I require unlike the HP DV5 pavilion which does not have any port on the rear.2. The socket of the audio out is very tight something not usual when I plug my Creative earphone which was formerly supplied by DELL & IPAD earphone.
