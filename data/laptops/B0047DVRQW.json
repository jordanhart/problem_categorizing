{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Entry Level Air - Great Extra Mac", "Author": "Steve H \"books911\"", "ReviewID": "R2HI8AQJVGVBBA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have a somewhat interesting take on the 11.6-inch MacBook Air.  I chose the 13-inch model for myself, but my father who is always on the go for business, chose this 11.6-inch model.  He wanted the extra portability, and I wanted the extra performance of the larger machine.Visually, the machines look different.  My 13-inch model does not look significantly different from the front or rear compared to a full featured MacBook Pro. In other words, on the 13-inch model, which I love, the footprint of the device is basically the same as a 13-inch MacBook Pro.  The difference is the slim side profile, and the two missing pounds.This 11-inch model is not only light and thin, but has a smaller footprint too.  It is striking to see.  It looks small, and it's gorgeous.  I do have some envy for the portability of this model compared to my own, which is light, but yet takes up just as much space so to say as a MacBook Pro.The drawbacks to this model and the reason I chose the 13-inch?  The processor included in this 11-inch machine is a fair bit slower.  Comparing some online benchmarks, this entry-level 11-inch model with the 1.4 GHZ Core 2 Duo brought in about 70 percent of the processing speed of the entry level 13-inch model.  While other parts of the machine are equally as fast, such as the graphics processor, solid state storage, and memory, the processor performance difference is not insignificant. You do feel a slight performance difference between the 13 and 11.The included storage on this model is 64 GB.  This will be plenty to store text documents and a moderately sized photo library.  However, you will not store much video on here.  However, the storage is solid state and fast, which enables fast startups and allows the machine to still feel snappy despite the slower processor.Apple specs the battery in this model at 5 hours, whereas the 13-inch model has a quoted 7 hours.  Apple is using a new battery testing procedure, which is said to more accurately predict real world battery life.  Nevertheless, the battery life edge does go to the 13-inch model.The display is no slouch despite its 11.6-inch size.  Indeed, its resolution is similar to the Mac Book Pro's 13-inch display, so there is no question that the display is gorgeous.iLife 11 is included and already installed on this device, so you will be able to take advantage of the latest iLife software right out of the box.  Two USB ports and a mini display port allow for expandability and compatibility with external devices.  Connect an external hard drive for expanded storage, or sync up your iPhone. No problem.  Indeed, believe it or not, this small 11.6-inch MacBook Air can drive the 27-inch Cinema Display that Apple sells.  That shows the impressive graphics performance this small machine offers.I was able to spend another hour today with the 11.6-inch model.  I am nearly beginning to question my decision to choose the 13-inch model.  The 13-inch asks you to take fewer sacrifices in terms of performance and storage.  However, this 11.6-inch is oh so portable.  Honestly, it's surprising when you see it in person.  This 11.6-inch is probably destined to be the \"cool,\" choice.Overall, it is clear to see there are several drawbacks to the 11-inch model.  Less storage, shorter battery life, and slower processor.  However, there are several benefits: a smaller footprint, lighter weight, and therefore easier portability.  Plus, there a cool factor that makes jaws drop when you pull this 11-inch model out of your bag.  Despite its diminutive size, it's a quality product.  Make no mistake about it, while it might be less powerful than other Mac notebooks, the 11-inch Air is no net-book.  The quality and performance far outshines any net-book.  This machine will serve your word processing, consumer photo editing, music listening, email writing, and web surfing needs without issue.  I might caution its use as one's sole computer only due to the limited onboard storage (64GB) and somewhat slower performance (1.4 GHZ Core 2 Duo Processor).  Highly recommend product for the correct application/use.", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic travel notebook", "Author": "G. Ware", "ReviewID": "R2CQO2Z9LUJPBP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a MacBook Pro 15 inch and love it for every day home use. But, I sometimes travel overseas and to lug the 15 inch all over due to size and weight is not ideal. Currently I have a Samsung NC10 Netbook with Windows XP, 2gb ram, 160gb hard drive and use that for travel. I like the netbook for travel as it is small and light and has built in camera for Skype when traveling. Overall, not a bad device except for one thing.....it is slow!!! Even after upgrading to 2gb ram on the netbook it is just plain slow and sometimes moving around is painful and frustrating. But, it was the best choice until now. I checked out the new MacBook Air and it is a thing of beauty, so I picked one up. I like the slightly larger screen size then the netbook, which at times seemed too small. I also like the larger keyboard on the Air compared to the netbook. But what I like most is the speed. With the core 2 dual core processor and flash storage, the Air is quick. I never feel frustrated. The Air is also lighter then the netbook which for the size screen and keyboard is amazing. So here are my pro's and con's.Pro's1. Quick- not a full speed notebook but for the size and weight this thing is great compared to netbooks.2. Light- 2.3lbs for 11.6 inch Air is fantastic.3. Keyboard- keyboard feels good.4. Mac OS X- enough said. If you have never tried it compared to XP or Win 7 then you don't know what you are missing.5. Storage- fast flash storage. More dependable compared to hard drive on mobile device.Con's1. Price- 1k for base 11.6 inch unit is not cheap by any means.2. Storage- the storage is fast and more dependable but its expensive and limited. The 64gb works for me as this is for travel and not my main notebook so I keep a lot of \"stuff\" off of it and just do internet, email, word docs etc.3. Upgrade- can't upgrade RAM if needed after purchase.Overall, I'm thrilled with my purchase. Yes its pricey but for the size, speed, quality and OS it is worth it in my mind. I probably wouldn't buy it for my only notebook but its a great travel notebook while my MacBook pro stays at home. My netbook did well for what it is but time to sell it as for me it is just too slow and XP is getting old as an OS.", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "FANTASTIC!! Pushing the Envelope of Personal Computing", "Author": "DocDenver", "ReviewID": "RCOO418DK7O0D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I hesitated a lot to buy this thing, costing as much as it does.I finally did, and LOVE it.I have been using PCs for years.  Have a PC at work, figured I'd just do the same at home.Bought a netbook - price was great - but the screen was small and it just never was easy to use.  Gave it to my neice.Bought a 17\" laptop with Vista - I actually thought Vista was OK, and I loved being able to make the screen resolution larger - so it was very easy on my 52 year old eyes.  But the thing was HEAVY.  So big and bulky I would often leave it home when going on a trip.  Also got real tired of having to run anti-virus software (and pay for it), and having glitches regularly with various types of software - adobe, the sync programs, etc.  In addition, if I was in bed and wanted to check something real quick, it took 30 seconds or so to boot up, and then had a glitch where the screen wouldn't turn on, so I'd have to put it to sleep and wake it up again.I bought an iPad, and the instant on was great, but after using the iPhone4 I didn't like the screen resolution.  In addition, it was quite heavy for holding up to read, did not have a keyboard, and couldn't play Flash videos.  Sold it.So finally bought this little guy, and it really fits the bill.  I thought the 11\" screen would be too small, but for some reason it seems much bigger.  I think it's because it is so easy to scroll up and down, back and forth using the touch pad.  (On the PC, the scroll never became \"unconscious\" - it often seemed to distract me just enough to find the proper place to push on the touchpad).  Maybe it's the resolution of the Air, maybe it's the fact that it is so small I can position it right where I want it to be.It jumps to life right away, I love that.  Easy to look stuff up, or send that one email, or whatever I want to do.  (I think I have a little ADHD, so when I turn on my computer and it takes 60 seconds to get ready, I often forget why I turned it on!).It downloads web pages much faster than my PC laptop or my PC desktop, and handles pictures much faster too.And the size makes it so I can just grab it and go, rather than having to make a conscious decision about \"should I bring the laptop?\"  It easy fits in my hand next to my notepad/binder and I hardly notice carrying it.IMHO, this is what a laptop was always supposed to be.  I LOVE it, LOVE it, LOVE it.  Thanks, Apple!!  Now I have to decide if I'm going to move everything from my home PC to Mac platform - and if so, should I use only this little guy?  (i.e. TurboTax, all those accumulated Word documents, etc)Oh, BTW, I did hook it up to my 24\" HP monitor, and it works great.  You can use two screens if you want (i.e. have the AIr open and the desktop monitor is an \"additional\" screen - or having them duplicates of each other, but the resolution is less than the desktop can handle.  It doesn't look quite as stunning as those iMac screens, but very close.And the final thing - the \"chicklet\" keys - very worried about getting used to them, the spacing seems a bit different than my other computer keyboards.  It did take a day or two, and I still make the occasional mistake, but overall I like them BETTER.  I can type faster on them for some reason -- ?less key travel?  Anyways, that turned out not to be an issue for me at all.I just think it's amazing to have this little slab of metal that I can pick up and take anywhere in my house, or anywhere in town, and have full computer access and use within seconds.  Right now I'm standing in the kitchen (it's sunny in here but not in the office) typing away.  I'm a happy camper!  (And now I have to make my lunch - can't afford to eat lunch out for a few months to pay for it, but it's worth it!)", "Date": "January 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "The future of the classic Laptop...", "Author": "Zarick Berger \"Zareck\"", "ReviewID": "R1JEU4U5KN2GD4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I mostly do film, video and photo and use a 2006 MacPro for editing and a recent MacBook Pro for writing. Two weeks ago, I got the 11' Macbook Air with a 64GB Flash Drive and 4GB of Ram to replace the MacBook on a few occasions. Or so I thought...Ergonomics:Ever since they replaced the 12' for the 13' in 2005, I was hoping for something smaller. In a interview, a 13' or 15' screen acts like a wall and it's size and weight keeps you from grabbing it easily. The 11' Macbook Air makes this possible again. Closed it feels more like a small binder then a computer. Open, it feels like a normal laptop but the screen is low enough, not to separate you from the person in front of you.The Screen:The resolution is very high, but this also makes everything a bit small for my eyes and the colors change a lot depending on the angle in which you view the screen. But, and this is big... the screen has a luminosity of 360 cd/m\u00b2. This means that you can go out on a sunny day and work without straining your eyes. This is head and shoulders above anything else on the market.The Battery:I would definitely wish for more then 5h, but this is probably the price to pay for a bright screen. I'm actually wondering how they got a battery into the casing.Processing Power:Office: Very fast. The Flash drive works wonders here. Absolutely no problems.Photo: The Air is just as fast as the new 13' Macbook Pro or the older but mach bigger MacPro. The mix between 4GB of ram and a fast flash drive lets Aperture work swiftly trough the 20MB files from the Canon 5D Mark2. Attention tough, it also seems that the 2GB version tends to joke on the amount of data.Video editing: I can perfectly edit and grade a ProRes 1080 24p file in Final Cut Pro with the MacBook Air. There are a few differences to the MacPro. It plays h.256 video files smoother then the MacPro with its older 7300 Graphic card. But the 4 processors of the MacPro are faster for video exports and transcoding. It's a tie...Connectivity:A 11' screen is rather small for video or sound editing, but when you add a keyboard with a mouse and an external HD, you can close the Air and use it with the full native resolution of the 30' screen. This is very cool. Same goes for TV. Just attach a HDMI cable to the Air's video port and you have a beautiful 1080p image on the big screen. As nice as this is, the Air hasn't been built for professional editing tough. You cant hook up 3 screens at once and when you have 16 TB of data to work with, you end up with a lot of external cables. But the new video port works wonders and the fact that you can close the computer and still use it, is very nice.Conclusion:Because of the flash drive, there actually is only a small performance difference between the new 13' MacBook Pro and the 11' MacBook Air. Compared to a 1e generation Intel MacPro it does a few things faster, like playing h.264 video files and a few things slower, like exporting and transcoding video files. Thanks to Moors Law, we got now a extremely silent, small and powerful computer at a very low price. The new Air isn't some crappy net-book that can barely run a text-editor, it's a computer that can hold it's own against a 1e generation Intel MacPro in a package that is about 200x smaller.The Macbook Air feels like a glimpse into the future. Who else has access to the cheap flash, the precision machining and the electronic know-how that is necessary to create such a slim, portable and capable computer at this price? Just a year ago, the 64Gb Flash option costed as much as this whole computer costs today. The luxury prototype of yesterday has turned into the most affordable laptop in Apple's lineup today.", "Date": "November 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "The MacBook Air 11.6 inch Laptop", "Author": "Tanner D. Silva", "ReviewID": "RDZGD8ERLZC73", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a student in high school, I depend on a computer daily to do assignments. My teachers distribute rubrics and have us turn in all of our projects online via a website. Many students use the 400+ school computers that the school provides, however, I used an iPad for three quarters of the school year. It worked good, but I always had the feeling that something was missing. I felt like I had to adapt my entire workflow based on the apps, which should never be the case for a daily-use device. The iPad 2 has nothing new to help with this issue, so I decided to sell my MacBook Pro 13\" to buy a MacBook Air 11.6\". As far as specifications go, the MacBook Air is a great upgrade from the iPad no matter how you look at it. The MacBook Air has a 1.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo (Dual Core), the original iPad has a 1GHz single core A4 chip (iPad 2 has a 1GHz dual core A5 chip). The MacBook Air also has a much better GPU with it's NVIDIA GeForce 320M graphics chip. It has a FaceTime camera, USB ports, MagSafe charger, and it runs OSX, which is far more sophisticated than iOS in every way. It is a phenomenal operating system. It also has a larger screen with a higher resolution, a full sized keyboard, and stereo speakers (you wont be rocking a party with these tiny speakers, but it is impressive sound considering how small this laptop is). Not to mention the fact that the MacBook Air can run Adobe Flash (even though it isn't installed out of the box). To me, this MacBook Air is really everything that I wanted the iPad to be. It is small, compact, silent, fast, and light. This laptop feels weightless when in my backpack, and leaves plenty of room for other items even in the smallest pouches. Apple also claims that this computer has \"instant on\", just like the iPad. Many people have misinterpreted this. The screen wont turn on instantly, rather, everything is up and ready to go right away. On my MacBook Pro 13\", the screen turned on very quickly, however, after the screen turned on, everything felt very slow for about 30 seconds. This is not the case on the MacBook Air. The screen turns on at about the same time, however, everything is all ready to go. There is absolutely no lag, thanks to the SSD. The SSD is also why the laptop feels much faster than the specs give it credit for. It is amazing; the laptop manages Pages, Keynote, iPhoto, and Safari flawlessly. It's speed is equal to my 3.06 GHz iMac in basic tasks (iPhoto, Pages, Safari, etc). The USB ports on the MacBook Air are on separate sides of the product. This is nice if you have very large cables that take up a lot of space, because you don't have to worry about covering up the other port. I'm sure this was unintentional, but it is very nice to have. There is no backlit keyboard, however, the brightness from the screen (50%) offers plenty of lighting for the keys. The lack of an optical drive has not been an issue for me at all. There is something about this computer that I have yet to figure out that makes it very very zippy. It is the perfect coffee-shop companion. It is ideal for people who are always on the go, travelers, and (maybe) college students. All in all, if you want more power and freedom (with the OS) out of your iPad, you will be very satisfied with the entry level MacBook air. The screen resolution is great; it makes you feel like you are working with a much bigger screen. Build quality, battery life, speed, and portability are all phenomenal. I highly recommend this Mac. If you are on the fence, I recommend heading over to a Best Buy or local Apple Store to get your hands on one. Simply, the specs do not give this laptop justice, and will perform perfectly for 90% of Mac users out there.", "Date": "March 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "The most practical Mac ever.", "Author": "Samuel Chell", "ReviewID": "R3JJ7BI146AIOC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the machine I didn't find on Amazon when they first started showing the 2nd ed. Mac Airs.  All I wanted was the most basic model, giving me a writer's dream--a machine for writing, a bit of e-mail, a bit of shopping on the internet.  Instead, I had to settle for Amazon's configuration of the new Air 11.6\", which doubled the memory and added significantly to the price.  At present, this Mac Air is the best deal you'll find, beating even Apple Store's Educator rates (esp. after factoring in tax).I've had the machine for over 2 weeks, and it makes the larger Mac Air (13\") screen seem like a heavy and hot monster by comparison.  Also, I totaled my first ed. Mac Air when I nicked the hinge, the Achilles' heel of the previous model.  Soon the internal circuitry was shorted out.  The problem has been fixed in the new Air, which employs a far more solid, more flexible hinge.  An additional USB port has been added, though don't be surprised if you discover a mere single USB port is adequate (a $7 Belkin hub never failed me).  As for the absence of a CD-Rom drive, I still can't recommend the Apple Superdrive as an add-on.  I continually experienced jammed CDs, and the lack of a mechanical ejector is a major negative.  Save yourself the money and headaches and get a portable Samsung burner instead (at almost half the price).As for the loss of the illuminated keyboard in the latest editions, it was largely a cosmetic feature, not bright enough to be practical during nighttime use. Besides the new hinge, the major improvement of the recent models is extended battery life.  With the previous Mac Air 13\" I was unable to get more than 90 minutes from a full charge (I run my screens bright); the present model more than doubles the battery life (even more so on the new 13\", which has more space for a large battery).This is the computer I would recommend for anyone who doesn't plan to use their personal machine for holding their entire media collection--audio, images, videos.  It's made for action--for business as much as pleasure.  As an Apple fan, I was motivated by all the hype to pick up an iPad.  Somewhat disappointing--at least in my case (and only time will tell if iPad devotees will continue to experience raised pulses at the announcement of yet another \"app.\"  The iPod Touch is cool and practical, and I'd miss it more than the ever-present ballpoint in my shirt pocket. The iPad, on the other hand, immediately struck me as surprisingly thick and heavy, especially compared to the new Kindle,  Despite the superior display, it's hard not to see it as a bloated Touch (without the cameras).Apple owners' needs will vary, but for me it finally comes down to:  1. an iMac for a base station; 2. the stripped-down Macbook Air 11.6\" as a productive satellite and traveling companion; and 3. a Touch for music and games for the grandkids.

This is my first Mac computer, and the transition from Windows has been painless. The hardware quality is top notch, and the software of Mac OS X 10.6.5 Snow Leopard is well executed. The portability of course is that of a netbook, but even better, due to the great construction and 2.3lb weight. The main reasons I bought this machine were: 1. Switching from Win 7 to Mac OS X; 2. Portability; 3. Perceived qualityPros:Small footprint, very portable.High quality of hardware and software.Large, multi touch trackpad is excellent.Keyboard is spacious and tactile.Applications open quickly due to SSD hard drive.Super quiet, barely gets warm when the processor really works.No finger smudges unless you touch the screen.Very nice screen.Unlike some reviewers, I think the speaker quality underneath the keyboard is good; users also can see/hear me well on Skype calls.Cons:I expected better battery life. On half brightness, with basic usage (email, surfing), I get about 5 hours. If watching videos/Neflix, basic usage, and editing photos in Photoshop, I get about 3.5 hours. Still better than my previous laptop, but I expected more life.The Core 2 Duo processor is definitely slower when pushed to the limits than today's current crop of Intel Core chips.For this price, I really expected 4GB of RAM.No SD card slot is unfortunate.Personally, I do not care about the omission of an optical drive. The 64GB HD is also sufficient for my needs. I also do not care that the keyboard isn't backlit as the previous generation was.If you're a heavy programmer, require plenty of processing power, and need tons of on-board storage,  I don't think this Air model would work. I'd stick with a MacBook Pro or a Windows 7 Intel Core i5/i7 machine. If you're a basic user and require some heavy usage (photo/video editing, webdesign, some program writing), I think this machine will meet your needs.

It's replacing a Netbook which I had doubled the ram and personally installed an Intel SSD drive. Despite these upgrades, the Netbook was still a boat-anchor. Having had two Netbooks and been for the most part disatisfied with their performances, I considered instead to go for it's bigger brethren, one with an i3 at a minimum. I live in Canada and despite living in one of the largest cities, I didn't have an array of options at my disposal. The best option for me since I do lot's of traveling and wanted something with a small footprint, and lightweight was this Macbook 11.I have a very fast and up to date PC desktop running Windows 7, which this Mac won't ever replace.

The screen is absolutely gorgeous. Really, there's nothing out there that can compete with it. The screen alone is almost worth the price of admission! The keyboard is nearly full size and it too is excellent. I'm new to the OS, so I can't really comment on it. I haven't spent enough time with the unit to be able to offer an opinion on the battery life.I've installed Adobe Flash and it plays video content without a hiccup. While I can't speak for anyone else, I can say that with multiple tabs open in Safari and video playback, that the system is certainly fast enough for me. The dual core 1.4Ghz cpu is certainly not cutting edge, but at the same time it isn't a slouch, easily blowing away the Atom cpu in the aforementioned boat anchor! With an SSD drive, GeFore 320 GPU and 2GB of ram, the apps open instantaneously! I wanted to get the unit with 4GB of ram, but no stores here had it in stock and I would have had to wait 5 to 7 business days for Apple to ship one to me. I didn't want to wait. Why Apple would decide to solder the RAM to the motherboard is beyond me! So far I'm not seeing the laptop suffer secondary to the lack of RAM.

Comparisons to cheap, limited netbooks or much larger and more powerful laptops are largely missing the point, and if either of those solutions are a better fit for you, then the Air isn't what your after. But if you place a premium on getting the most functionality out of the smallest form factor possible, then the 11 inch Air is the way to go. I wouldn't really consider the 13\" unless you had a very compelling reason for that extra screen space, as the 13\" MacBook starts to look more appealing then.What impresses me most about the MBA 11\" is how snappy and responsive it remains, even while running multiple instances of graphically intensive games, a browser, streaming music and working in Pages, though I did spring for the fastest processor and most memory available, since there's no way to upgrade later.

For the record, I am not anti-Apple.  I own a 17\" MacBook Pro which I cannot live without and a 27\" iMac that runs my home setup.  I have an Airport Extreme, Airport Express, and a Time Capsule running my home network and backups.  An iPod Touch is connected in my car for music management.  I don't care for iOS devices, so I have an Android phone, not an iPhone.  No iPad, I think it's too limited to be of any appeal.  But the iPad and this MacBook Air fit in one category: Appeal without value.See, the reason you see so many 5-star reviews is not because of value.  It's because of appeal.  Same with the iPad and iPad 2.  The reality is, these devices look appealing.  They go into areas that others have yet to broach (Samsung is the closest).  They deliver a form factor that people find quite convenient, with \"good enough\" power and function.  Backed with the strength of Apple's support outlets, you can't help but think that this, as well as the iPad, are \"magical\".  The reality hits you in the face: they have appeal.  They do NOT have value.  Unfortunately, so many people ignore the straight-up mathematics of it that they will never understand what I'm trying to say.  I'm going to set the iPad aside in my discussion, but know that it fits in the same general category, and everything I say here applies to it.If you've been living under a rock, the 11\" MacBook Air is one of the newer directions that Apple has set for its portables.  The form factor feels just right, the weight is near perfect, and it boasts the full OS X experience.From a hardware perspective things don't look so rosy.The backlit keyboard of the previous generation has been removed inexplicably.  The screen quality pales in comparison to the MacBook Pro (and I'm talking about general quality in real-world situations, NOT stated quality on a spec sheet).  The silver border almost makes the machine look cheap, especially since it doesn't feature a matte display like a similarly equipped Pro would.  The CPU, while \"good enough\", is just not a powerhouse in either configuration, and Apple, as always, forces you to opt for the 13\" model to even get a CPU that is capable of higher end computing - you know, things like Logic Studio Retail.  Given the thickness of the machine is identical in both the 11\" and 13\", it's frustrating that you cannot put a stronger processor in the 11\".  In theory, you should be able to throw a 2.2 in there without too much trouble, but then of course Apple would have to actually offer these things at a fair price.  There's also no Ethernet port (given how thin it is), no optical drive (which might be a plus for you), and no external media card reader.  For this latter option you're forced yet again to go for the 13\" Air.  If the idea is to go smaller and agile and wireless, you would think an SD card slot would be feasible.  There certainly is room for it on the right side.  I should also point out that you cannot upgrade the RAM on this by yourself since Apple saw fit to solder it to the board.  That means if you buy any model with 2GB RAM and regret it after your return window, you're SOL.  Unfortunately, as everyone knows, Apple charges a steep premium for its RAM upgrades over third party vendors.  This, in my opinion, makes the MacBook Air - both 11\" and 13\" - just not appealing options for anyone but the willfully oblivious.The 11\" actually comes in lots of different configurations:- Base model: 64GB SSD, 1.4GHz processor, 2GB RAM- Base model with more storage: 128GB SSD, 1.4GHz processor, 2GB RAM- Base model with storage and RAM: 128GB SSD, 1.4GHz processor, 4GB RAM- Higher end model with storage: 128GB SSD, 1.6GHz processor, 2GB RAM- \"Ultimate\": 128GB SSD, 1.6GHz processor, 4GB RAMThe local Apple Store will usually stock the base model with storage, rather than the \"Ultimate\", inexplicably.  Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that the \"Ultimate\" ends up being quite pricey - to the point of being almost the same price as the base model 13\" - yet at half the power and storage of that model.  Makes no sense, and therein lies my second complaint with the machine: its price.  If I boiled the Base model down to its core components, it's $799.  Period.  Apple wants $999 for that model.  At first, I didn't understand Apple's pricing methodology, but now I think I've figured it out.  They price based on the maximum component price at the time they design it, without taking into proper consideration the component price at the time they sell it.  For example, I know that right now I can go and buy a 64GB SSD for a little over $100.  In Apple's world, it's $200, because that's what the price was when they were designing the thing.  I can't fault them for that logic necessarily, but it lessens the value (there's that word again) of the MacBook Air in my opinion.  Better to select the Pro, where you can buy your own drive/RAM and save hundreds over Apple's configurations yet get superior performance and value.  What you lose is Apple's support of the drive/RAM, but most storage manufacturers offer decent warranties so you don't really have to worry about it that much.When you look at the 13\" MacBook Pro vs. either of the Airs, you start to shake your head at the sheer lunacy of things.  No matter what Air configuration you go with, you're overpaying compared to the Pro.  The only appeal (there's THAT word again) of the Air over the Pro is the form factor.  The \"instant on\" is negated when you install a SSD in the Pro.  The Pro can hold more RAM than the Air, allowing it to do more multitasking.  The Pro, equipped with 4GB RAM and a good SSD, can boot faster than either Air - proven in numerous videos.  The Pro will run pretty much whatever you throw at it, where the Air struggles on certain apps such as Final Cut and InDesign.  The Pro can have larger drives added at your leisure, the Air cannot.  The Pro can have its RAM upgraded, the Air cannot.  It's REALLY hard to justify a $1199 MacBook Air 11\" with only 2GB of RAM, when you can get a 13\" MacBook Pro for the same price with 4GB of RAM and a processor on its BASE model that is 5x superior to the strongest Air.And so I come to the part that people just don't understand: Value vs. appeal.  Value means, for the money I'm paying, is what I got worth it?  And I don't mean \"worth it to me\", I mean WORTH IT.  The answer here is no.  The 11\" MacBook Air is not a good value.  It is an appealing machine - great form factor, travels well, feels nice, good battery life.  But the value is not there.  A price point not exceeding $800 would have made the machine right on the top border of a good value.  If you ever plan to sell it, the resale value is not there.  People are not wanting to pay even $800 for it because they don't see it worth it for the lower end model; that's telling.  If you're one such person that is willing to pay for appeal...meaning you have no qualms about paying a clear premium for something because it appeals to you...then by all means the 11\" MacBook Air is fine.  But in this day and age when people should be considering true value and whether they're getting their money's worth out of a device, the Air falls flat at its current price point and hardware configuration.If you look at true value, the 13\" MacBook Pro is the best dollars-and-cents value Apple offers at this time of all of its hardware.  If you look at true appeal, and are willing to pay a premium for it and disregard true value, then yes, the 11\" MacBook Air wins of all of the devices.  Should you choose to lean that direction, if nothing else, get the \"Ultimate\".  It's still grossly underpowered.  But trust me, the alternative will leave you stuck with a machine that won't meet your long-term needs.", "Date": "June 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Macbook Air 11.6 is a great ultraportable", "Author": "bcrow87", "ReviewID": "R1ZSYXIJQK0HAR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Macbook Air 11.6 inch from Amazon two days ago.  I have spent approximately 10 hours playing around with it for the past day and a half.  I am writing this review on it and it is truly a thing of beauty and functionality. If you need an ultra-portable, and are thinking of buying one of these, stop thinking and just buy.  You will enjoy it immensely (this is coming from a windows and Linux user).Just to give you a frame of reference, my background is rather techie.  Up to this point, I have primarily used Windows products, and have used Linux more recently.  I have a home-built Windows 7 based PC that I use for my 3D design, gaming, and occasional office work. In this day and age, we all need some sort of mobile computing platform. I had an HP Touchsmart laptop (tx2-1025dx), and it was a noisy, hot little bugger! I was afraid it would just up and die on me one day when I need it most. I even applied new thermal paste (artic silver 5) on the CPU.  While that did lower the CPU temps by about 20C, the fan still ran very loud to the point it was: A: distracting and B: making me scratch my head as to why it was roaring while I was typing a paper and listening to music at the same time.The owner/user can't do anything about a poorly designed heat sink/fan unit (duh). One small fan and a rather puny copper heatsink setup covers the CPU, ATI graphics chip, and a few other heat producing components. Thus, being sick of it, I purchased the new HP dm1z with the new AMD E-350 GPU/north bridge/CPU on a die.  While this is an awesome technology and the laptop had awesome battery life, it also ran noisy.  Using CPUID HW monitor to see the temperatures, the temps would routinely come very close to the max for the chipset while doing pretty routine tasks. Windows 7 is just too heavy of an operating system for that machine and not optimized (and most smaller, underpowered windows laptops I would imagine, but I am just generalizing).  Even though the outer casing was relatively cool, the temps on the hardware were just too warm. Being on a tight budget I wanted something that would not fail after two years. After two days, I decided I was done dealing with any HP products. But enough of my rambling...what about Apple?I purchased an iPhone 4 from Verizon when my Palm Pre Plus died after eight months.  I was skeptical of using an apple product, considering their proprietary nature (and my love to fix my own computers), but love the phone hands down. Apple's ability to optimize the hardware and software for each-other is amazing.  I am very impressed. The MacBook Air 11.6 is absolutely no different. I use it around college for your generic office work use and the occasional streaming video (which is smooth btw).So here is probably what you have been waiting for: The Pro's and Con'sPro's-Vibrant Screen-Screen appears bigger than it actually is due to the high resolution.-Screen is very readable, even in bright lighting conditions!-Very high quality construction: No warping, solid, thin, feels like it will last as long as I want to keep it.-Trackpad is highly functional and a perfect fit for this laptop. Love the gestures.-Screen is solid, but I wouldn't try throwing it down a flight of stairs to test its durability.-Mac OS X Snow Leopard is a great operating system. Reminds me much about Linux (both based on UNIX at some point), which warms my heart. Definitely the best for optimizing battery life that I have seen. (Linux tends to have 1 to 2 hours of battery life less than windows on the same machine, but that's what you pay for for it being free and in no way optimized.)-I love how secure it is. I have heard the reason OSX is so secure is due to multiple redundant lines of code for a single action to make it a p.i.t.a for hackers to write viruses.-Battery life is outstanding for my uses. Here is a frame of reference; right now the battery meter shows: 73% and 5:35 hours of battery remaining. That is with Firefox 4 open, bluetooth off, Wireless on, and brightness on four dots. Running music gave me about an hour less of time. No biggie, for its size, I can't complain. That could also have been temporary, since it updates every few seconds.-Obviously, it is really light, fits just about anywhere.  It was either this or the iPad 2 and I am glad I went with this. It has more functionality.-Graphics performance is very good with streaming Flash videos from Hulu. In 360p, online video streamed without a hitch.  I could not say the same about the other mentioned ultra portables I have tried without them getting loud and hot.-It stays pretty cool. Up to this point, I do not believe anyone should worry about burning their lap or hand.-Fan is silent for most uses.  Video playback kicks the fan up a bit, but it is barely audible. No vacuum cleaner fans here. Coming from the other laptops I can definitely deal with it.-Apple, as a company, builds a very good product for a reasonable price. You won't get this level of hardware/software optimization/integration in a Windows or Linux PC. Let's just say Apple has never made outdated hardware look so good!-This thing boots in under ten seconds and shuts down even faster.  I haven't timed it yet, but I can definitely say it boots faster than my quad core 3ghz desktop running a solid state hard drive and windows 7. <--again with Apple's hardware/software optimization.-The ability to share my DVD drive on my Windows desktop over my wireless network. Can be useful at times.-Mac App store -- Pretty sweet, no need to pay more just to have a DVD copy, a fancy box, advertising, and some more useless paper that we almost always never read..and subsequently throw away, or preferably recycle. So far, I have downloaded Apple's Office suite (Pages, Numbers, Keynote). The price outbeat their educational discount on the Apple store for the DVD version. Cool huh? Definite Win.-Comes with a software and Mac OSX re-install usb drive. A win in my book. In this day and age with Microsoft keeping users from having software re-install discs and resorting to restoration partitions on the same boot hard drive to save you, it is refreshing to see Apple trusts their customers a bit more. If you don't have any backup discs or a backup USB from those partitions on a windows machine, and your hard drive fails, you are screwed. You'll just get to install the operating system to its factory configuration with all the bloatware. What if we want to do a fresh install without all the bloatware and associated headaches of removing them? At least Apple doesn't have bloatware. They focus on useability in their machines, not using them as a purely marketing platform. I can guarantee you, the Windows machines would be more expensive if they didn't have all that pre-installed software installed. Marketing pays for it all.-To help even further, MAC OSX has the Time Machine backup, which is an awesome and a useful program. Haven't done one yet, but I'll be sure to backup my computer soon.-Solid state hard drive-awesome! It won't fail suddenly like mechanical hard drives. Gives you warning to back your data up.Con's-Price is high, but you can't complain for this quality of hardware and software they provide.  Though, the user experience is the best I have dealt with thus far.-Apple charges for everything...but hey that's Apple..you definitely get what you pay for with them.-It can be dangerously easy to spend too much on the Mac App store. Buying keynote, pages, and numbers set be back 60 bucks in under 10 seconds.-Can't perform my own maintenance on it as easily as a Windows or Linux laptop, but hey I can't complain, this thing is designed to last. That pretty much makes my job easier. I tinker less, and get more useability. Awesome! The most common thing to replace is obviously the hard drive, but the SSD makes that pretty much a moot point with most SSD's averaging a five year life span or more at the current time. About 1.2 to 3 million hours Mean Time Between Failure.  Not sure what Apple's MTBF on their SSD is, but that's what I am seeing as an industry average.  Intel quotes their value low-end SSD's to about 1.2 million hours MTBF, or about five years. My Kingston 64gb has a 1.5 million hour MTBF. This obviously depends on usage.-So far, I haven't found a way to utilize the home or end function on the keyboard, or a delete function from the beginning of a sentence. Rather I have to go to the end and delete backwards from there. I am sure it is user error.

I have to defend it. I'm running CS5 and many other programs. It is a GREAT COMPUTER. I can imagine it as a primary computer.

It's a portfolio type case (think ipad) and It's a great addition. I simply love, love, love this computer. My next purchase will be to sell the 15\" MBP (in about 6 mo when it is time to replace) and replace it with an imac. Then the air will be my only laptop.

Though I own a Mac Pro, an iPad, and an iPhone, I'm really glad I added the MBA to my repertoire of Mac hardware.I use my iPad everyday for ebook and other e-reading, as well as web surfing, but the MBA is most useful to me for writing beyond my office desktop Mac. While I don't like the high price of Mac products (thus the reason for taking off one star), I just couldn't resist the design and style of the Air. When the 2008 MBA was released, I totally detested it. It was way overpriced and it didn't feel like a netbook. This is not the case with the 11\" Air.I chose it over the 13\" Air simply because I wanted a small computer, but not as small as the Dell models or other netbooks.At first typing on the Air felt a little uncomfortable, but after few days typing with it I got used to it. Also adding essential apps that I use on my desktop (Butler, Typinator, Hazel, ClipboardSharing, QuicKeys 4.0, etc.) has made my Air nearly perfect.The only frustration I have with owning both the Air and the iPad, though, is that they seem to overlap in some areas. It would be cool if Apple could combine the two enabling users to run both iOS and OS X.Anyway, I highly recommend the Air as a secondary Mac or if you're a student needing a computer to carry around with you. The base level Air, which is what I have, will not work well for heavy duty photography work or other media projects like long iMovie videos, but it's great for small projects or editing existing larger projects that you started on your desktop Mac. It definitely can replace a MacBook Pro unless you're using the latter for heavy duty work.And as the specs say, it is fast, especially when you raise the lid. It does have instant start-up, but you do have to wait a few seconds before the mouse cursor appears.The battery life is good as Apple claims, and the trackpad gestures are the best way to navigate programs. Overall, it's a great machine, and if you don't mind the price tag it will be a computer you keep around for quite some time.", "Date": "February 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Choice", "Author": "M. Kelley", "ReviewID": "R332Q5U552NJRX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I debated long and hard about whether to get this or the larger MacBook Air.  I am very happy with my choice of the 11.6 version.  It is light; the screen is easy to read and very bright, and everything else about it is perfect for my needs.  I especially love the keyboard feel and don't miss any of the features that the larger Air includes.  I've already got USB SD card adaptors, and am not a great maker of movies or editor of audio files, so additional capacity was never a need or a concern.My main concern was getting used to the Apple operating system after being a life long PC user.  I still have a PC at work running Windows XP and one at home with XP as well.  This MacBook makes them both seem clunky and basically obsolete!  It starts up nearly instantaneously, each program loads immediately after being clicked on, and the whole operating system (Snow Leopard in my case) is intuitive and easy to learn.For a newbie to Apple's OS, their prompts and on-line training videos are all that you really need.  My only criticism was that the directions about how to work the button-less mouse pad were buried way back in their \"getting started guide\" and I needed to call Apple when first booting up and signing onto the computer since I didn't know how to advance to the next steps.  (The mouse pad actually moves downward on the left hand bottom and right hand bottom corners when pushed hard enough, not just tapped, and that provides the button clicks you need).  But aside from that little embarrassment (and the need to find out all of the serial number and other information before I could talk to the Apple expert on the phone), everything else was smooth sailing.This is a fantastic product.  Well made, easy to use, and well worth the money.  I've had two Windows-based netbooks -- one with a 7 inch screen running XP and the other with a 10 inch screen running Windows 7 and neither worked the way I wanted.  Windows 7 Starter is a real disaster.  I sold both of those and this MacBook Air is my reward for sticking with the search until I found the perfect truly portable computer.  This is full sized in feel and look, but it's light, slim, and totes around as easily as any of the netbooks.  A perfect solution.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Truly Amazing", "Author": "S. Zhao", "ReviewID": "R1VWGMFULFZ2CS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So, I was a little skeptical when I first bought this computer but I had pulled the trigger on it, based on lust alone. Just look at it. It is gorgeous. However, I am a techie and specs have always mattered to me. Paying a thousand dollars for a computer without an i processor was seemingly outrageous. My last computer was a Dell Latitude e6410 with a Core i7 processor, 8gb of ddr3 ram, and a 128gb SSD. The Macbook air obliterates it.First, a disclaimer. I am a student and do not do any heavy design work. The most taxing thing I actually do is watch movies in 1080p, some photoshop and flash cs5, and a little fruity loops from time to time.For all intensive purposes, this computer is perfect for me. I am a business student and need to carry lots of heavy textbooks around. Therefore, carrying a five pound computer with a charger is not too comfortable. I can slip this in my bag and barely notice it. People do stop and gawk at it occasionally but I guess it comes with the territory. However, at the moment, I am listening to music in iTunes, reading an article in adobe acrobat, and checking email/facebook. There is no lag yet to be seen. Reading on this is much more pleasant than on any other computer i've ever used. I was considering an iPad for this reason (since I need to read lots of case studies) but i'm glad I opted for this. Zooming in, scrolling, and all functions needed to make reading bearable, are perfection. Also, people might think that the paltry 64gb of flash memory is ridiculous but I have embraced it as a manner of focusing myself on the basic functions of computing. I have a 2tb hard drive at home and a 23 in monitor so when I am on the road, I don't need more than what is preinstalled. If you do though, a 1tb WD My Passport is about a hundred dollars.Additionally, I have installed Windows 7 Ultimate through boot camp and it runs great. The setup was a bit of a hassle because the Windows support software (with all the MBA's drivers) was not downloading correctly. However, I just kept at it and eventually, it finished downloading. The one caveat of the windows experience on this is that the instanton feature is not as wuick in windows as it in in osx (but it's still faster than almost all windows laptops).Finally, the only slight disappointment I had with it is that the battery life is not great. I've not gotten more than 3 and a half hours (normal web browsing and some light Office work) yet in an age when the Toshiba R835 with an i5 can get 7-9 hours. Not a huge issue though.Overall, best computer I've ever owned.

Mac OSX takes a bit of getting used to coming from years of Windows usage.  The first few weeks I hated the machine.  Everything seems opposite from what you are used to.  But after a few weeks of swiping and tapping, I fell in love.  I've been using this as my primary computer rather than my secondary computer for awhile now.  I still don't get iPhoto though.  Photos as files are so simple in Windows to post anymore or locate.  Within iPhotos, it seems harder to batch upload to Facebook and harder to locate.  Of course there's a sync option with your FB account but I can never get that to work.  I love how iCloud syncs everything between my iPhone, iPad and Mac.  But it's buggy as well.

So when I had the money to buy another laptop I looked the macbook air and I didn't know whether the screen would be an issue. And the screen isn't. The screen is well too me its not small. This laptop is good enough for someone that just wants to do write, read, browse the internet; the laptop is great. The macbook air is fast. The machine has a full size keyboard. The keyboard feels just like a full size one.Coming from a Windows owner I knew how the macs worked and that is something that I really wanted was the interface of a mac. its truly simple and easy too use.

Returned it to APPLE for repair and found out it needed a update for Software. I currently work on a small island with BAD internet.Then it happened again about 2 weeks later after I shut it down. I tried to start it but it would start at all!! BLACK SCREEN NO NOISE or SOUND.  Called APPLE we did a reboot with the USB reboot that came with the Mac. When I run a systems check for software update it says I don't need a update but still the issue persists making me think this is not a software update issue. So again I rebooted the system.That solved the issue. I lost temporary files and work I had on it at the time.Then while in Thailand I shut it down and again i had the same problem it wouldn't start. So i repeated the process of rebooting it by using the USB reboot. No problem it came back and lost some of my work that wasn't saved yet.Ran into a guy in Bangkok who had the exact computer and he told me he had it for 3 weeks when his just shut off. He returned it APPLE after having no luck restarting and it had been only 2 months since he had it back and again it did the same thing to him again. He told me his was getting hot with the programs he was running.I love this little computer when it works,however i fear when it will shut down or not restart. I hope Mac fixes these issues cause for portability and ease of use this little things works great when it works but i fear during a presentation or building a project i will loose the work or the job based on these issues.Otherwise i think if you can get past these problems it will be a standard of future laptops for all and I still love this little thing. Great Battery life, fast processor, great graphics, keyboard is sized right and the price is acceptable.Because of the shut down, reboot and inability to restart this MAC at unknown times I can only give this LIL Mac 4 stars and not 5 Stars.", "Date": "May 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "NIce Product, Nice Shopping Platform", "Author": "Lei", "ReviewID": "R3JCJXVKS6UIWL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is so easy shop in Amazon.

I still marvel at how quickly it boots up and opens apps. Our company recently install a video chat system for our sales reps.  It's software based and works well, and it pushes the capability of my MBA.  Don't get me wrong - it still works great - but the processor gets very warm and the fan is on high when running the video app - along with the 5-7 programs I usually have open.  I of course could mitigate this by closing those programs... but I don't want to.  That's one reason why I bought the MBA in the first place.So if you're going to run a video program like ours, it tilts the buying decision a little bit more towards the MacBook Pro.  But I'd still buy the MBA, I love it that much.  And now the updated ones are out with the faster processor, which I'm sure helps a lot.Original review: This is about the 6th or 7th Mac I've bought in addition to various iPhones, Airports, etc., but I have to say this is the best Apple product yet.Although all of my immediate family members have had MacBooks for years, I never got one for my office, as we are mostly Windows-based there.  At home though, I've had a couple of iMacs over the past 5-6 years, which I love.About 8 months ago my Dell laptop was on its last legs, so I bought another one, this time with Windows 7.  Initially I was reasonably satisfied with Windows 7, as it is much more Mac-like than its predecessor.  But as the weeks and months rolled on I soon came to realize that for someone like myself, the Windows platform has become obsolete.Why?  I'm somewhat of a power user.  Running a publishing company, I usually have 6-8 programs open at once, e.g., Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Firefox, IM, Outlook, occasionally Photoshop and the like.  The Windows platform just chokes on this stuff, at least my Dell laptop did - just like the one before it.  There's just something about Windows that seems like there's so much running in the background all the time.After months of having the Dell seize up because it couldn't handle the load, waiting 10 minutes for reboots and watching that little spinning circle ad nauseam, I had almost had enough.  And then one day, 10 minutes before an important meeting where I was to give a presentation, I decided to restart the computer so it was \"fresh,\" and the dreaded \"Installing update 1 of 1\" came up and ground on and on.  I switched to a colleague's computer and made up my mind to make the move to a Mac.I looked at both the MacBook Pro and the MacBook Air (MBA).  It was a tough choice because the Pro has a more powerful processor and I need the power.  Or so I thought. On the other hand, I loved the idea of solid-state hard drive and the small size and weight of the MBA.  I chose the MBA.It turns out I was somewhat wrong about my need for power. Although I occasionally do some image and video editing, mostly I use word processing, spreadsheets and the like.  Because of the MBA's solid-state drive, the applications open almost instantly - literally about 1.5 seconds - and it reboots in less than 15.  I routinely have 5-8 apps open simultaneously with no degradation of performance.  It's really unbelievable, even compared to my iMac at home.  I did buy the extra 2 GB of RAM for a total of 4, and I'm sure that helps.  Even though I have the slower processor compared to the Pro, it seems faster from what I remember at the Apple store.  So I was confusing my need for power with what I really needed, which was the ability to get work done in many apps simultaneously and quickly, a distinction lost to me until I got the MBA.  This thing is really a dream to use; no waiting for anything, no hesitation... it just does what I want, when I want it.On a recent airline trip, I was in coach and the woman in front of me reclined her seat all the way.  Not a problem though... I was able to open the MBA fully.  I have the 11.6\" model.  Not only does the small screen size help, but the thinness of the unit also makes a difference, as does the feather-lightness; it's so easy to move around, when the person in the next seat wants to get by you for example.  When I get back to the office I plug it into a 22\" ViewSonic screen, and a mouse and keyboard, and it all works great.  So here are my pros and cons:Pros* Lightweight and small - fits in any briefcase* Boots up in less than 15 seconds* Applications snap open in just a few seconds, sometimes less* Uses the Mac OS, which compared to Windows, is a complete delight to use* It doesn't get warm or hot, and there's no fan so it runs absolutely silently* Has a \"cool\" factor that's undeniableCons* No optical drive - but has a cool OS feature that lets you use one wirelessly in another computer on your Wi-Fi network* No RGB jack - I had to buy a $30 adapter* Same thing for Ethernet - if you need it, you'll have to buy an adapter* Expensive, about 30% more than my DellI reluctantly list the cons, because believe me, they are completely outweighed by the pros, at least for the way I use it.  I suppose if you do heavy-duty video processing, need access to network databases at work or need an optical (DVD/CD) drive all the time, this wouldn't be the pick for you.  But if you're a business user like me, I recommend it 110%.  Otherwise, I'm sure the MacBook Pro would be an excellent choice.I love to see American companies create and produce products like this.

I've been trying it out at Best Buy and I liked it, but I bought mine of Amazon since it was cheaper.I have always used to Windows laptop and I wanted to see what was good about Macbooks.First thing I'm going to comment on is the design. The design is very sleek and thin. It can feel a little fragile on the hand, but it's really good in build. I found it difficult to open the macbook at first, but it got easier after awhile. Definitely looks very expensive ( Well, it kinda is) and most definitely a head turner. The silver is really nice and makes the apple logo really pop.I must say, running the macbook is very fast. While it takes a couple of minutes for Windows to set up, the macbook took like 20 seconds flat. Very fast and I appreciated that for someone who is quite impatient. When you close the macbook, it automatically turns to sleep and when you open it up again, it starts running in just seconds. No more waiting.I can't say much about the software as I had no experience with macs before to compare it with, but I think it has the same features as the other mac. For a windows user, it takes getting used to how the mac works, most especially when installing items and opening and closing applications. But overall, I love how quick the applications open up.The mac does have some major flaws though. It doesn't have a disc drive. Not that I used it all the time, but I would've appreciated it if it came with one. I guess they took that out in favor of the slim design. It also doesn't have a memory card slot. I can't upload photos from digital cameras without having to use a usb cable.Overall, I love the performance and design of the mac, but for its price, they could've atleast offered it with a disc drive and memory card slot", "Date": "April 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excelente equipo", "Author": "Alex Garc\u00eda \"alexeiiw\"", "ReviewID": "R2BDOGVP295MUH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excelente equipo, el empalme entre el hardware y el software es perfecto, no es una netbook es una notebook muy poderosa, la mobilidad es increible, no habia tenido experiencia con equipos mac y esta es mi primera compra y estoy muy satisfecho.Ademas soy usuario de Windows y Linux y me parece que el SO es perfecto, estan los programas y puedes decidir entre pagar o buscar uno gratis.Sin duda estos equipos estan orientados a hacer el uso mas sencillo para todos.Saludos,", "Date": "December 19, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,087.10", "Features": "Ships in Certified Frustration-Free Packaging\n1.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor\n2GB DDR3 RAM\n64GB Solid-State Hard Drive\n11.6-Inch Screen, GeForce\nApple Mac OS", "Name": "Apple MacBook Air MC505LL/A 11.6-Inch Laptop (OLD VERSION)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41eqsktcM7L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0047DVRQW"}}
