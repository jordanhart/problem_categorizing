I'm a high school student and I mostly use it for editing papers and surfing the web, so it serves its purpose. The size is great-small and light enough to easily carry around, while still big enough to have a good-sized screen. However, there is a rather thick plastic border around the screen, which is unfortunate as you lose about an inch of the screen.This computer comes with A LOT of bloatware-enough to slow it down considerably. If you can, reload windows as soon as you get it. This computer does not have a cd reader, so this may be difficult if you do not have an adapter.A problem Im having with this computer is that there are covers on the ports, and they are badly made. It is difficult to open them and they get in the way of my wires. They also look as though they'll crack off within a few months, if that.Also, this computer gets VERY hot, very fast. If you do buy this, keep in mind that you'll almost definitely have to get a cooling fan, as it gets extremely hot.The design is ok-not the best quality (mostly plastic) but ok. The cover can be switched for a different design or color. The screen resolution is not the greatest- it is average at best.I like this computer because it works pretty fast-6 GB RAM is unusual in a computer in this price range.All in all, this computer is ok. It was a good purchase for $350.00, although Im not sure what its going for now. If its being sold in the 500 dollar range, I would recommend doing research on other computers, as you can find better ones for the price. For the $350 range, this is probably the best thing youll find.", "Date": "September 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "bad experience, good performance", "Author": "Ilkan A.", "ReviewID": "RZPT2KVB59K8S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, I have used a lot of laptops professionally, dissassembled many laptops so many times.Fujitsu siemensAsus A6jcAsus G73jh A2Dell Lat\u00fdtude E6410Packard bell NAV05Acer 54seriesThese are my previous and current laptops. But only this one has stupidly placed hardwares and cheap palmrest (case) whose nails were broken in the first hdd replacement trial. Then while right corner nail which hold keybord was also damaged and keyboard is making noise during pressing top right corner letters.If you want to buy this and just use. Do not dissassemble to replace RAM or any of the hardwares, especially harddisk.This is my dissapointment.When you look at the performance, laptop is doing good job with W8 and 128 V300 SSD (yes, I broke the nails but managed to swap to SSD). Startup is around 6-8 seconds.WEICPU - 6.5RAM - 7.2VGA1 - 5.1VGA2 - 6.3HDD - 7.9If I don't destroy laptop physically, I am planning to use it for a long time due to its performance.Edit: Additions- Battery life seems good. Wifi is on, brightness is @max and couple of episodes are downloaded and watched during cycle. It lasts around 5 hours.- It comes with 1 month McAfee and Office 365 subscription.- CPU fan isn't starting working till CPU is overloaded since CPU is consuming only 17watts. Therefore it is very quite. Even the fan is working, it is working slower than usual.- I didn't see any heat issue. Only the section where fan sits is heating slightly but it is difficult to feel from keyboard.For these positive reasons, I have changed rate to 4 stars.", "Date": "August 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dell Inspiron 13z What I expected!!!", "Author": "Jonathan Garcia", "ReviewID": "R5FUD8VWTRDJX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "August 08, 2013Dell Inspiron 13z (Computer model: Inspiron 5323)July 15, 2013HARDWAREIn this range price: unbeatable.

Then I called Dell technical support and spent an hour on the phone call but finally did not figure it out again so I decided to return the laptop as anyone will do. After about one week, the seller said they tested the laptop and it worked well and they will deduct 15% of my refund. I sent several emails trying to explain the problem I met but that did not change anything.So my experience with this laptop is I expected it help me with my work but it did not do anything for me, I had to contact with different people trying to solve the problem within those weeks and finally I returned the laptop and lost 60 dollars.
