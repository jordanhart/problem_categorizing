(not sure if this review will be placed for this specific spec or for all MacBook Air 11\".)LAPTOP USE:mainly for work. checking email and managing contacts. viewing documents.i am also an amateur photographer so i will be doing some light photo work.huge gamer. see below for more details.DESIGN & CONSTRUCTION:there's not much to say regarding this. it's built like no other machine i've ever used. it's rock solid. i have read some reviews stating that they were concerned with the joint where the screen meets the keyboard area but it should not be of any concern. it feels great in your hands. i can find no flaws with the laptop itself. make sure you go to an Apple Store and play with it to see for yourself.OS:i am currently running both OS X 10.6.5 & Windows 7 Ultimate 64. it came installed with OS X 10.6.4. make sure you update this before you install anything.Apple states that you can only install Windows 7 through Boot Camp using a DVD player. after some research before i bought the laptop, i found this to not be true.by using an open-source program called rEFIt, you can install Windows 7 using a USB flash drive. you can also install Linux, if you wish. by using this program you can dual boot or even TRIPLE BOOT on your MacBook Air.if you would like to install Windows 7 using a USB flash drive, you can use a program by Microsoft called \"Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool\" to accomplish this. make sure your USB flash drive is at least 4GB for installation. YOU ALSO NEED A COPY OF WINDOWS THAT YOU PLAN ON INSTALLING HANDY.INSTALLING WINDOWS WITH A USB FLASH DRIVE...** UPDATE ADDED **** before you go and install Windows 7 on your shiny new MacBook make sure you've updated your OS X to 10.6.5 first! i was so excited to get Win7 on my MBA that i installed it first before upgrading. i had installed EVERYTHING. all my PC programs and had it set up perfectly. bad mistake. when i upgraded the patch it wiped my NTFS (Windows 7) partition and everything there. ugh. save yourself that headache and PLEASE UPDATE OS X to 10.6.5 FIRST!!!i have recently increased my Mac partition to allow for more room for my Mac needs. it is now at 48GB for Mac and 70GB for Windows. your needs may vary so give yourself ample space for both partitions. if at a later time you need to increase/decrease your partition sizes, you can do so easily by doing a FULL BACKUP WITH A SYSTEM IMAGE using Windows BACKUP or any other Backup program. remove your Windows partition ONLY AFTER doing the backup. go into Boot Camp Asst and create a new partition. connect your choice of Windows 7 installation, either USB OR DVD. do a RESTORE with the backup of the system image and backup files you made. VOILA... you have everything the way it is again. ***make sure you first go into OS X. click on Boot Camp, which you can find using the Finder feature or go into your Utilities folder. get to the second page. download the Windows support software for your Mac. you're going to need it later after you've installed Windows. save this on your other PC. hopefully you have a PC to run that Windows 7 USB/DVD Tool. just go through the steps it tells you and you should be done. now place the \"WindowsSupport\" folder you dl'ed through Boot Camp onto your flash drive. you should have 3.65GB used. i used Windows 7 Ultimate 64 so your size may be less.now you should already have installed rEFIt. if not, you should do so now. follow the instructions on their site. this gets installed through OS X, just in case you're wondering. after installation, make sure you reboot your MB Air at least twice. don't ask me why. it just takes at least twice before it gets fully working.as you're about to do your second reboot, plug in the flash drive you have Windows 7 installed. as your MBA loads up, you should get a screen with a few icons, which you may have noticed after your first reboot. just select your USB drive and VOILA! you should now be starting your Windows 7 installation. once you're done make sure you install the Boot Camp drivers in the \"WindowsSupport\" folder. Boot Camp 3.2 is out so make sure you update to that ONLY AFTER you've installed 3.1 first. you will not be allowed to install 3.2 without 3.1 installed.WINDOWS 7 GENERAL USAGE:Windows 7 Ultimate 64 runs smoothly on the MBA. i was very surprised. it boots up almost as quickly as my 3.4GHz desktop which has a SSD drive. considering the MBA only has 1.6GHz this thing can only be labled as a BEAST. i like to tinker with my computer a lot so i've removed many startup services and programs that i don't need and just eat up valuable resources. i will not go into details about it now but if you are curious just ask and i will comment back with some good info for you.i have installed Lightroom 3.3 and Photoshop CS5 and they run very nicely. it will definitely not give you the same experience as a 3.4GHz desktop but considering the size of this laptop, you should be pleased.Hulu & Youtube runs quite nicely. definitely not as smooth as my desktop but then again look at the size of this laptop.i personally have not installed Windows Office 2010 because i've opted to go with the free Libre Office program. it is still in beta stages but runs quite nicely without any major hiccups. i also have Firefox and Thunderbird installed. they both run well.WINDOWS 7 GAMING USAGE:i currently play Battlefield: Bad Company 2 and Black Ops. i installed both on the MBA. i was quite shocked that it ran pretty well. of course, you will most likely have to run at lowest settings but if you need to get your fix for blood and you're away from home then you can! let's be realistic though. you really don't want to be playing games on a 11' screen. to be honest, i had such a hard time seeing enemies that were far away in BFBC2.MAC USAGE:this is my first Mac. i was very hesitant booting up the MBA the first time. it's like that first day at high school... as a freshman. you thought you knew it all but now you're in a totally new environment. fear strikes in.don't fret. you're about to embark on a wonderful new adventure!i am beginning to love the Mac OS X. it's so stable and runs as smooth as a babies bootie on this laptop.i have Aperture 3, Final Cut Express 4, Lightroom 3.3, Photoshop CS5, Firefox, and Thunderbird installed on the Mac OS X. they all run very well. Final Cut Express will not be the same as a desktop experience most definitely but you can do some light work on your MBA. i also suggest you install a program called Onyx to remove any garbage files. also get Growl. a very nifty program for Mac's.** UPDATE ADDED **** a commenter had asked about doing a fresh install of the Mac OS X. i know what he meant immediately. most laptops come with some sort of BLOATWARE (garbage programs that slow your system down). Mac's are not plagued by this issue so you do not have to worry. since the storage on your MBA will be limited compared to other systems, every bit of free space is valuable. OS X contains files for use with X11, which is a X Window System implementation for running X11-based applications on Mac OS X. Based on the de facto-standard for X11, the open source XFree86 project, X11 for Mac OS X is compatible, fast and fully integrated with Mac OS X. It includes the full X11R6.6 technology including a window server, libraries and basic utilities such as xterm. if you have no idea what i just wrote, then you won't need this. :) i'm not sure if it's installed by default but since i had to do a fresh reinstall due to the OS X 10.6.5 Update patch wiping my Windows partition. there are also over 1GB worth of language support files within OS X and other Mac programs. you may want to do a fresh install due to these reasons but if X11 is not a concern of yours and only removing the language files then there is an easy solution. check below for more details under the \"RECOMMENDED MAC OS X PROGRAMS\". **RECOMMENDED MAC OS X PROGRAMS:after a few more weeks of use, i have been using OS X a lot more than i had first thought i would. due to these reasons, i have been researching for more OS X programs. here are my results. i will add more as i come across them.1. CleanMyMac: this program is A MUST HAVE. it does so much i can't even begin to tell you everything it does. basically, it cleans out all your garbage files, unnecessary junk, and language support that you won't need. i gained over 2GB worth of storage space from this program. THAT'S A LOT! considering i just got my MacBook so it wouldn't have any accumulated that many temp files. it goes to show you how many other files there are you don't need.2. Onyx 2.2.1: this is another MUST HAVE. it is a multifunction utility for Mac OS X. It allows you to verify the Startup Disk and the structure of its System files, to run miscellaneous tasks of system maintenance, to configure the hidden parameters of the Finder, Dock and of some of Apple's own applications, to delete caches, to remove a certain number of files and folders that may become cumbersome and more.3. KisMAC: it is an open-source and free sniffer/scanner application for Mac OS X. i've used this for when i'm out and need to get more WiFi info than is given through OS X. many of you probably won't need it but it's a nice program to have.4. WinClone: clones your Boot Camp partition. can be useful for many applications. (use with precaution, as it seems to be no longer developed. i suggest you google this application and see if it fits your needs.)5. Libre Office: an open-source Office platform program. it's the better version of Open Office, in my opinion. it's FREE so try it. it's also available for PC.6. Text Wrangler: 90% of you won't need this, but for the other 10% it can be very useful. this is the only free program that does this that i could find. A powerful and richly-featured tool for composing, modifying, and transforming text stored in plain-text files. It features flexible \"grep\" pattern-based search and replace, syntax coloring, and function navigation for C, C++, and Objective-C. Also includes integration with the UNIX command line via the \"edit\" tool, built-in support for opening and saving files to remote FTP servers, and a rich plug-in architecture.SUGGESTED PRODUCTS FOR YOUR MACBOOK AIR (which i am using. do a search on Amazon for these products.):elago Mobile Nano II USB 2.0 microSDHC Flash Memory Card Reader (Black)Western Digital My Passport Essential SE 1 TB USB 3.0 and USB 2.0 Ultra Portable External Hard Drive WDBACX0010BBK-NESNLogitech Wireless Performance Mouse MX for PC and MacSamsung USB 2.0 8x DVD Writer External Optical Drive for Mac and PC SE-S084D/TSBS (Gloss Black)Transcend P8 15-in-1 USB 2.0 Flash Memory Card Reader TS-RDP8K (Black)FINAL WORDS:i love the MacBook Air 11\". i do not regret purchasing it at all.i hope you have all found this review helpful. i am sorry to those who i have bored with my long rant. i hope i helped a few people decide on purchasing this laptop. if you have any questions, feel free to ask in the comments section.cheers!", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Marvelous Machine!  Really!", "Author": "vcponsardin", "ReviewID": "R15WTMNKG0DSAB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I should admit upfront that I am not a scientist or engineer. Nor am I a gamer or video editor. I am a scholar and writer, so my use of this machine is largely limited to word processing, Power Point presentations, web browsing, and watching streaming videos. Thus, my experience will very likely differ from those who'll be using this computer to run several large and sophisticated programs simultaneously. Given these parameters, I am simply thrilled with this addition to Apple's MacBook collection. I am a relatively recent convert to Apple products after nearly two decades on PCs. So my views might be positively colored somewhat by the enthusiasm of the newly converted. I have been using a MacBook Pro 13\" for the last year or so and I can safely say that this new MacBook Air 11\" is simply a charm and a wonderful companion to the larger computer. Mine is the fully maxed-out model, with the factory-installed 1.6 chip, 4GB ram and 128 flash. I bought it to use for travel to libraries and research centers, and to carry easily from home to school. While I've only had the machine for a short time, there is no doubt this will be instantly more useful than any PC or Apple I've owned before. I have now spent several hours running it through its paces and I am genuinely impressed.My first reaction was that it truly is as amazingly thin and sleek as it looks in the ads--almost disconcertingly so compared to my MacBook Pro. My first few times typing, I thought I might break it, it seemed so thin. But it's a toughie, no doubt about it. Light yet solid. Easily slips into my bag--hardly noticeable. It took almost no time at all to set up. The battery charged in less than an hour and, so far at least, seems to run almost as long as my Pro, though I do have to be especially careful to quit programs I'm not using to preserve and prolong power. I installed Office Suite 2011 in 15 minutes via the wireless network through the university. No need for a disk drive in this instance. Even more exciting, it easily networked wirelessly with my Pro and I was then able to operate its DVD drive as if it were part of the Air. Amazing. Assuming you have another MacBook, there really is no need for a DVD drive in this machine.Since I write for a living, having a comfortable keyboard is essential. I was delighted and surprised to see that the 11\" Air has a keyboard that measures exactly the same as my 13\" Pro--no difference whatsoever. And the overall feeling is quite good with just enough bounce and resistance--essential in my view for effective typing. Only thing lacking are the illuminated keys--a nice feature, but certainly not essential. I don't think I'll miss it. The backlit screen is physically smaller, of course. But there are more pixels per inch, so it is amazingly bright and crisp.  In fact, in a side-by-side comparison, this screen is every bit as brilliant as the screen on my Pro, and is certainly brighter and with greater high and low contrasts than the screen on the standard MacBook.  Again, I am quite delightfully surprised by how good this screen is, since I was expecting something less in such a small package.  Everything reads slightly smaller as a result, of course.  But I still have no trouble reading whatever's on the screen.  I imagine people with poor vision might have a slightly harder time reading their usual sites and documents. But I have no trouble--and my eyes are not perfect by any means. The improved track pad is a joy to use and genuinely intuitive. I am especially pleased to see the one finger \"tap to click\" option once again that you don't find on the older MacBooks--makes navigation that much faster and easier.Despite the processor being only 1.6GHz, the speed seems to be about the same as on my MacBook Pro. Here, I'm sure more sophisticated users and gamers will disagree. But I am able to run Youtube, Netflix, and Hulu videos flawlessly. No discernible lag, no annoying pixelating. It certainly boots up faster (that solid state storage makes a noticeable difference there) and many of my usual websites seem to load up just as fast if not faster than they do on my Pro. So I'm not sure I will notice any difference in CPU speed, given my rather mundane needs and uses.  But I'm glad I got the faster chip and larger RAM, nonetheless, given the ever-increasing demands of programs and the Internet.  These upgrades make normal usage a breeze and should extend the machine's viability a bit longer.Downsides? None yet--apart from minor issues like the lack of an SD slot, an Ethernet port (USB extension is available for purchase) and additional USB outlets. But I'm happy to sacrifice these things for the convenience of a light, ultrathin MacBook. No doubt this machine will now become my primary tool.Be aware that this maxed out edition (1.6/4GB/128Flash) must be factory installed through special order. As a result, it takes longer to arrive than most might expect. Certainly longer than the 1-3 business days Apple claims it takes to process the order. Mine took 18 days from the time I placed the order until it arrived from the Apple factory in China. Your experience may be different. But don't expect it to arrive within just a few days.In short, this is an excellent machine. Whether it is worth the price is up to you. But I'm more than happy with it. Obviously, I can't attest yet to its durability, but it feels solid and stout, and I expect it will get quite a bit of use.", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Lite powerhouse", "Author": "Brendon Allen", "ReviewID": "R2VPXPXJQOOC7Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a core i7 main 15\" MBP and I wanted a travel laptop.  I figured for big trips I would need the big boy to take the load.  I was wrong.  I bought the pimped out 11\" model and it has handled admirably.  I would like a 256 model as well but I think I will be able to find a bigger flash drive soon enough.  I have been amazed with the ease the 1.6ghz handled everything I threw at it and multitasked like a champ.  I would not do any video editing or encoding on this little guy but I don't really do that on the road anyway.  I think my 15\" MBP will be getting a lot of at home time these days.  if you have the money to pay the apple tax you will not be disappointed.", "Date": "December 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Ferrari Netbook", "Author": "David D.

It's everything my old powerbook was, but better.  Better screen, better keyboard, better battery life, and fast.

I'm a new teacher, so I thought I wanted something that would allow me to move around, carry files back and forth, and occasionally burn CDs.  I could not have been more disappointed.  I paid more for that computer than I paid for this fully upgraded 11.6in MBA, and from the moment I got it, it was plagued with problems.  Beyond that, getting any kind of support from Dell, especially while I was traveling abroad, was probably the worst customer service experience I ever had to endure.  Even after I did get it fixed, it continued having screen and overheat problems well into the space of time that the warranty ran out.  In addition, the fact that it was almost 5 lbs and 13 inches often led me to question whether it was worth dragging with me on a trip.  More and more, the answer to that question was simply no.Fast forward two years.  I was looking at an i3 11in Acer Aspire Timeline X.  Everything looked great, from the reduced price to the lower weight, to speed and new architecture of the system.  I was worried about some reports about the flex in the keyboard and poor customer service.  Still, I almost bought it, but the MBA caught my eye after reading a review of the Acer comparing the performance of the two systems.  I took a trip to Fukuoka (a city in Japan) to go to the Mac store there to have a look, and there was simply no going back.  The change in weight from 3.1lbs to 2.3lbs is huge, more than 20%.  Beyond that, the super fast boot times and ease of use are very difficult to ignore.  There was no bloatware like on the Acer and the build quality is simply unquestionable.  I've had a very good experience with the hinges, which are just the correct amount of stiffness to make them easy to use, yet stay where you want them.  It's so light and easy to take with me I never question if I should just throw it in my bag or not, of course it's coming!  Temps have been fine, even while gaming.  It gets pretty warm in some places during heavy use, but it's never gotten to the point it's really uncomfortable.  During normal web surfing and whatnot, heat is almost undetectable.  I don't know about customer service yet, since I haven't had to use it, but Apple is supposed to have the best service of it's kind.  Let's hope that's true if anything should come up.  I've never owned a Mac before, but switching was easy.  I joked with my friends I should bo buy a turtle-neck now and purchase a smugness adapter.I use this laptop for:  word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, Skyping from the comfort of my bed, listening to music, making iMovies, editing photos taken from my point and shoot, watching videos online, and light gaming.  This laptop runs both World of Warcraft and Starcraft for me just fine, though not at max settings (moderate settings, shadows and sunbeams disabled).  I also use it for reading and writing a lot of things to the internet.  Typing and using the multi-touch track pad is easy.  If weight, build quality, and ease of use are your primary concerns, I fully recommend this laptop.I do not recommend this laptop if you need a computational powerhouse.  Further, it needs an adapter for everything (including smugness).  This laptop could be troublesome if you need lots of USB ports, USB3, or an ethernet port.  Also, the adapter, which you must buy for wired ethernet, is not gigabit ethernet.  Further, there is no internal 3g wireless card so if you need that, it will be troublesome to carry that adapter around as well.  I use tethering with my android phone so this wasn't an issue for me.  Also, my Mac works great with my Sony Xperia Android phone, but your mileage may vary.  I was able to network it with my Windows 7 desktop, but it required watching some educational youtube videos as the process is definitely not intuitive.  If you need lots of disk space, obviously the flash member here isn't going to help you.  I've filled up half of this 120gb drive no problem with nothing but trimmed down versions of my music and photo collection.  Also, if you need something super inexpensive, obviously you shouldn't be looking at Macs.  I'm not saying I don't feel I got what I paid for, I feel I got that and more, but if you are on a $600 budget, this system isn't going to cut it for you.As none of the above was a problem for me, and the laptop's incredible speed and performance (mine boots in 11s) despite it's small size and sturdy construction make it get 5 stars from this user.", "Date": "January 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Exceeded my expectations!", "Author": "Simpleton Peck \"Electronics Junkie\"", "ReviewID": "R3VK26LI8R42K1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me fist start this review off by saying, I am not an apple fanboy by any means.  I own a couple ipods and that's about it.  This is actually my first mac computer I have ever owned.  Always been biased towards a windows based pc, but I must admit I think I've been converted.  I absolutely love the stability of the operating system and how easy things are to do on it now.  Older operating systems were a complete turn off for me about five years ago.  My next desktop will definitely be a mac.  Now onto my review.My intended use for this computer was basically surfing the web, word processing, light photo work, and a bit of video editing.  I can honestly say this little laptop handles all that and more like a champ.  I knew ahead of time upgrading anything on this computer wouldn't be possible so I went with the 1.6ghz processor and 4 gb of ram.  So glad I did!  I am able to run photoshop, office, and even adobe premiere (I know it's not the most stable editing software, lol), and final cut express without any issues whatsoever.  I have edited 720p footage without a hitch.  Is this the ideal computer to do video editing on? No, but you know what?  It handles it just fine.  The only thing I wish was faster on it would be the rendering but I just start it and walk away to go do something else.So what about startup time?  This laptop is seriously fast for its specs.  Waking up from sleep is instantaneous.  No joke.  Pop the lid open and you're ready to go.  From a cold boot I want to say only about 15 seconds.  Unbelievable.  I know the ssd hard drive has a lot to do with it, but you just can't complain with the results.  I think all manufacturers should switch over to these drives.  The speed absolutely outweighs the extra cost.Ascetically, this is an absolutely beautiful machine!  You will not find another laptop on the market this thin and light.  It's not much bigger than a netbook and offers so much more power.  You are paying for it though. By no means was this machine cheap.  The build quality is solid.  It doesn't feel cheap.  It feels very durable.  I guess time will tell.My only complaint would be the battery life.  I sure wish it was possible to get at least 6-8 hours out of it.  I am averaging about 4 hours.  Not bad, but definitely more would have been nicer.So there you have it.  I really hope this is helpful to potential buyers out there.  I did a lot of research before choosing this laptop and I can honestly say I am very satisfied with my purchase.

Also an iPad and several generations of iPod touches. But this 11\" MBA is fast becoming my favorite. This machine is fully loaded (4GB RAM, 128GB SSD, 1.6GHz) and motors along with the speed I'm used to in my 15\" MBP (also loaded).A few notes: Yes, there is not backlit keyboard. Not a big deal for me, but would have been nice. There is also no battery life indicator. Not a big deal but a feature I use much more than a backlit keyboard. Of course there is no SD card slot in the 11\" which is a bummer since that is something I could really use. The sound is tinny but I usually use an external speaker like the Altec Lansing iML237USB ORBIT Ultra Portable USB-Powered Speaker which I love (even if only mono. I also have the HP USB powered set and logitech's V20s).Something else I noticed is that this machine does not seem to work with the Apple IR remote.The tolerances for the USB connections are very tight. If you are used to the slop of most PCs, you will have to be a little more careful inserting connectors.The battery life seems as specified, and the bootup/wakeup speed is magical.I was working with this MBA along side a 15\" MBP and was surprised at just how small this wasn't. The wide screen is a significant piece of screen real estate. I moved my dock to the right, and turned on hiding. Works great. The only issue I have noticed thus far is when editing some webpages with fixed widths and columns, I have to use a horizontal scroll bar to move about the page.Over all, this MBA all but makes me forget my iPad.
