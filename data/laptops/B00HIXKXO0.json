This laptop is very heavy, the blu ray disc doesnt work, the wireless is not very stable. My recommendation is to avoid to buy this laptop!", "Date": "May 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Try the Samsung Laptop instead", "Author": "mary carson", "ReviewID": "R3T7YXKSDKCIFQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Blu - Ray disc player does not work; Toshiba recognizes the problem.  That's what they do, admit it does not work.Otherwise, it's ok, it's just ok.  It should be, shouldn't it?

TWO terabytes of storage?? Thats incredible. Quad Core with Intel A7 chip? Dream come true. TWENTY FOUR gb of RAM? pinch me please! All of these incredible things are enough to make most computer geeks drool. But what made me purchase this, vs similar priced, yet lesser equipped laptops, was being able to keep my beloved windows 7. Windows 8 sucks, and is extremely redundant, and unnecessary with a computer that does not have touch screen. Which I wouldn't want to have  anyway. I have had only a few issues switching over my data from my other Toshiba, which used a 1 TB external drive (Yea I now have  3 TB of storage, if you can believe that!) Anyway, long review short, If you have the buck$ and this model is still available, I recommend it. I have had it for 3 months now, and honestly, have not even come close to using this device to its full potential. Grab one while you can!!!", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "It so OK Laptop", "Author": "jwlee52 \"jwlee13\"", "ReviewID": "R2CQBQJNEV4MD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've upgraded it with a Samsung 840 EVO 1 terabyte SSD for the OS drive and this thing flies. If it would have came with one (maybe not 1tb) at the same price, I would have given it 5 stars. To max out to 32gb of ram from 16gb, the two open slots for memory are sensitive as to what memory you put in. I ended up talking to a Kingston representative to find out what specific part number would work. I returned the memory I bought because it wouldn't post and ordering the memory that he recommended. I will add to this review with a part number if it works. I did not see the Blue Ray player problem because I added Nero 12 Platinum and it worked right away. The battery does not last and a extended battery is not available. As you see, I make a laptop my own with minor modifications..Update: The memory addition, which makes the total 32GB, worked perfectly. This would not have happened if it wasn't for Kingston testing. The part number is KTT-S3CL/8G, which I purchased here on Amazon. The other Kingston memory would not post and ended up getting returned.", "Date": "May 17, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00HIXKXO0"}}
