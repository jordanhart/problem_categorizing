I have adjusted the cursor several times & now, even on the slowest setting, it's still \"loose\" & hard to control.  The sensitive keys have turned me back into a one-finger typist. I've been unable to fix this to my satisfaction.After only two months, the USB ports have become so loose they are unusable.  I am unable to charge my MP3 player, cell phone, & ereader or transfer media between them & the laptop. I've used several different cords; they all work with my five-year-old desktop, but none do with this nearly-new Toshiba.Before I proceed, I will say that I dislike Windows for too many reasons to list here. This Toshiba came with Windows 7, which, IMO, is even less impressive than Vista was.  Programs I use, like Windows Media, are not pre-installed & have to be dealt with separately.  The laptop comes with game demos, which I consider bloatware & had to uninstall.My biggest complaint is that something in the laptop's system is preventing me from installing Linux. I have tried installing several versions from both CDs I've burned & from free-with-Linux-magazines CDs with no success. I can't even install Ubuntu via wubi.I have tried to \"gift\" this to my sister, my boyfriend, & a nephew; they all refused to take it off my hands because of the problems I've had with it.I paid $349 for this drek; it was $349 too much.", "Date": "June 4, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B007JJJRB8"}}
