{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Gaming Powerhouse for a reasonable price.", "Author": "Bradley Proctor", "ReviewID": "R2SUKN1NJUJ2EQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I noticed some weak reviews for this product and am quite disgusted. I bought this unit from Best Buy and have so far been impressed. I typically am a desktop user, in fact, I normally custom build my own rigs. I was in the market for a laptop, and didn't want to frustrate myself with custom building one so I shopped around a lot. For the price, it will be difficult to beat this machine. The only laptops that will come close (Dell XPS, AlienWare, and MSI) would all likely cost and extra $500-$1000. Every game I have played so far (Portal 2, Skyrim, etc) have ran on ultra settings with extremely great frame rates. Now for the Pros and cons:Pros: Great heat displacement, it has two large exhaust ports on the backside of the machine. This keeps the heat off of the bottom and allows for \"lap-top\" computing. Processing speed is amazing. Cost is low, but shop around, I got it at Bust Buy for $200 cheaper (though the build is not exact to this model make your own decisions as to what you need). Back-lit key board is extremely neat. Large vibrant HD screen. Its not loaded down with a bunch of bloatware and demos. GTX 660M is a great GPU for most all (with the exception of the have to have the most expensive and overkill, melt your face GPU) users. Additional port for secondary HDD. Easy access for upgrades to HDD an memory. Ivy Bridge! This thing has blistering fast multi-app processing power!Cons (and the reason for 4 stars): The biggest drawback for me is the 1TB HDD, as it is slow (5400 RPM). For this reason alone Windows Experience Index rated it a 5.9. All other ratings were mid to upper 7's. Shame on you Asus. For $130 buy a 128GB SSD from Amazon and up your computing potential. Just use the 1TB as a slave. It is bulky, but to be expected as it is a gaming lappy. Good luck trying to find a case that fits it.Lastly the power brick is enormous and the battery is lucky to give you 1.5 hrs unplugged. Again, this is a gaming laptop so this is to be expected.Other thoughts: The pros highly out weigh the cons! For the price this Republic of Gamers laptop by Asus is a great investment.2 Year Update: I still use this laptop daily. Again it still runs almost all of my games on Ultra settings. Boot time is still about 9 seconds (Keeping in mind I did install a Solid State Drive). I use this laptop for audio editing as well. This is an important note as audio editing on my previous custom built PC and HP laptop was frustrating. Adding filters or even saving a file could take minutes. With this laptop, it is instantaneous. 2 years in and still the best computer purchase I have ever made!", "Date": "May 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent power, annoying audio bug.", "Author": "Greg Siegel", "ReviewID": "R11G1QA3D1S7MS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Everything you've read in the other reviews about its power is true. Portal 2, Skyrim, etc. all look beautiful on this laptop. The matte screen with full 1080p resolution is very nice and easy on the eye. The jet engine fans on the back of the laptop have allowed for hours of gaming without feeling like I could flip the laptop over and grill an egg.Now, some issues. One is that the space bar is not as responsive as I would like on a gaming keyboard. If I have my thumb too far over to one side, it will fail to register the press. This being the jump key in a lot of games, one can imagine the annoyance this has caused (I've run straight off of platforms like a dork).The major issue, however, is that the subwoofer will sometimes play when you have headphones in. For a while, every time I started a media source that had audio, I would have to pull out my headphones and reinsert. This is quite annoying when you are trying to play something in a crowded room, or when someone in your house is sleeping. I uninstalled the drivers and let windows install its own, but now it mutes the audio until I click mute then unmute again. I don't know what is going on with this audio chipset, but there appear to be some kinks to iron out.The audio issue is not a dealbreaker for me, as the laptop really is quite nice looking with excellent performance.I am hoping an update in the future will make my $1300 purchase perform as it should.", "Date": "August 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great machine for the money!", "Author": "technojunkie", "ReviewID": "R1KW78JOQCMYRC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm not a super gaming computer geek, but i know computers well and am an avid console gamer. I like playing fighting games like SFIV and the like and I also love first person shooters, action games, etc. Well so far I am VERY impressed with this behemouth of a machine! Not that street fighter is the most graphically intensive game, but i was coming from runing on my macbook pro under bootcamp with windows 7. Night and day difference. I can crank up all the settings including 8x antialiasing and the frame rate is stunning. no lag whatsoever. full screen full resolution all the bells and whistles enabled. Just Cause 2 i couldn't get the same with everything maxed out, but you probably would need a higher end machine to do that. With everything maxed out i was getting like 20fps but when i turned off the GPU water effect and toned down a couple other things i was getting a solid 60fps on the in game benchmark tests. Batman arkham asylum and the newer arkham city look positively stunning and smooooooth. The picture is great on this machine and the sound is quite good especially with the subwoofer. The power supply practically needs it own carrying case! Seriously this is the biggest brick i've ever seen on a notebook. The keyboard is very nice as is the track pad. the buttons on the trackpad have quite a bit of travel and feel kind of soft, but not mushy. The track pad also supports two finger rotation and pinch to zoom and 2 finger scrolling and 3 finger aero conrol of the windows 7 windows ala macbook (although it's nowhere near as smooth as the mac, but i didn't get this machine for smooth window navigation). I LOVE the rubberized feel of the plastic of the case. I also love that the machine doesn't come with 100 pieces of \"bloatware\"the 750gb hard drivecomes partitioned with about 300 (drive c) for OS and other programs and then a drive D (presumably for your gaming data) is about 400gb. There is still an open expansion bay for another hard drive I believe. Now remember, this is kind of the \"bottom of the line\" G75 with the 2gb graphics card (the 660) and the processors on the higher end units run a bit faster. So far the machine stays quite cool and it not even as noisey as my macbook pro (and not nearly as hot, you could make toast on my macbook when i was runing games in bootcamp). I don't know a lot about gaming machines but i've read that you can't just look at the graphics card or the processor but you have to look at everything together including how well the machine can cool itself because that can affect how well the gpu runs. I'm sure there are faster notebooks out there, but for 1500 bucks I am beside myself. I use an xbox 360 wireless controller and it works flawlessly, just make sure you download the 64bit driver from microsoft. For steam users, install it to the larger partition (the D drive). There is plenty of room on the 400gb partition. Even if every game you use is 10gb (which they usually are not) That's a lot of games with no external drive and you still have the C partition to store files on, plus you can always get another drive installed. I'm giving it 4 stars just to be conservative, but so far the only thing that's a bit off-putting is it's sheer size. it's much deeper than my 17 inch macbook and won't even fit (width-wise) into the sleeve of my 17inch backpack although it barely fits the length. I had to order an alienware backpack that accomodates the larger machines with the 17.3 screens. I travel A LOT and it is going to be really fantastic to have a complete gaming library with me wherever I go! Unless you're an uber-geek I would highly recommend this unit. Im sure it will do me for several years, but then again, technology is such that you're constantly kicking yourself for not waiting for the next better, faster, quieter, cooler, more power efficient thing to come along.Oh, by the way, the unit is lighter than it appears. Still heavy, but it is a desktop replacment, so that's just part and parcel...Hope this helps", "Date": "May 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Gaming Power at a Midrange Price", "Author": "Shef", "ReviewID": "R2X5A1CF4H5V8J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought my new Asus Laptop June 2 at a Best Buy.  The unit I received has slightly different specs than the one listed here however they are minimal.  The laptop I purchased has only 8gigs of RAM instead of 16 but has a 1TB Hard Drive.  Besides that it is the same machine.  However, I found it at Best Buy for 1299 instead of 1499 (which is rare because I never expect Best Buy to have the best price).  I ended up paying 1566 after 5% tax but that included two year comprehensive warranty, Microsoft office, and two years of antivirus which I couldn't pass up.  I went straight home to try it out and so far I am impressed.  The unit looks beautiful with the matte screen and the fingerprint resistant finish.  The resolution is stunning and the backlit keyboard is solid. (though the keys feel a bit cheap I am not at all concerned)As my main concern was graphics, the first thing I did was download Skyrim from Steam.  Booting up the game for the first time showed me how this unit is worth every penny.  Many reviews talk generally about the graphics of their system but at the end of the day, I want to be able to say how it handles specific games.  That being said, Skyrim looks FANTASTIC.  I played it on my xbox360 in HD and the performance on this laptop makes the 360 version look like its from the 90's.  The lighting effects, graphical details, and resolution are all amazing and the smooth framerate blew me away.  I couldn't believe how well it was rendering the dense foliage and textures without missing a beat.  I am confident this baby will run anything I throw at it for years to come.  I also noticed that getting my music onto ITunes was fast as well.  On my old computers, uploading hundreds of files into the program often caused it to crash and took hours.  I got all my music up in a matter of minutes.One thing I did notice was the vibrations of the DVD drive when it is reading a disk.  I didn't worry at all but you always prefer quiet disk drives.  As I don't plan on using much media from DVD/CD's the concern is minimal.  Also the sound quality is rich and there seems to be a built in sub woofer but the volume doesn't quite reach loud enough for my tastes.  However, I have external speakers whenever I really need great volume so this is another non issue for me.  I have yet to find any real cons to this system yet although I have only had it for a day.The computer runs very quiet and looks like a professional/nerdy mix of materials and design.  I would also like to emphasize that I did lots of research before arriving at this laptop.  I found that it had minimal negative reviews with many good ones that matched my graphical expectations and price point.  While some people may complain about the hefty size of the computer or the large AC adapter brick that accompanies the unit, you must remember that this is a desktop replacement gaming laptop and it serves its role admirably.  I would strongly recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a gaming powerhouse laptop without breaking the bank and is willing to sacrifice portability for power.**Update**I bought a SanDisk 120 GIG SSD on Amazon and went to Best Buy to let them install it.  The warrenty I purchased covered the instalation and migration of the OS to the SSD.  It took them three days to complete the job and I now have both hard drives in the machine: the 120SSD and the 1Terabyte 5400RMP-HHD.  I have to say it was a great idea to upgrade.  My computer boots in 20 seconds (as oppsed to about 60 before)I was able to load saves in Skyrim in five second as opposed to 10-15 seconds.  This is as fast as I have ever seen a computer run.  I store all OS related files and programs as well as games on the SSD and my music, docs, and movies on the HHD.  The people at best buy did remove the recovery partition, but I can take it back if something happens.  I highly reccomend doing a similar upgrade if you have an in store warrenty or if you know how to do it yourself.", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very nice powerful laptop with minor problems", "Author": "Sergey Antopolskiy", "ReviewID": "R2ZBOIBDLE8MS1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop from Amazon around a month ago. I planned to use it for analyzing my data in Matlab and gaming. Mainly as desktop replacement, but also for travels to conferences, collaborators, etc. I think I made the right choice, since up to now I am completely satisfied. Computer performance is extraordinary good, design is neat, keyboard is good.I experienced one unpleasant problem which I managed to solve. The computer every now and then (couple of times in an hour or so) makes a latency spike for about 1-2 sec, during which nothing works and if you happen to listen to music or watching a movie, it will make horrible screeching sound. I am pretty tolerant person, so I didn't care until this thing started to interfere with my League of Legend tournaments (2 sec lag in a wrong place equals to loosing a 45 min game). So I went online, and found this thread on the Republic of Gamers forum rog.asus.com/forum/showthread.php?14960-G75VW-random-audio-and-graphics-spike). It turns out that many people have this problem with G75. Someone on the forum reported that uninstalling McAfee antivirus worked for him. I tried and it worked for me too. I do not experience this problem anymore. But I have to warn you that some other people report that this solution doesn't work for them.There are other minor problems, which I want to report.1. When the computer came, the bottom rim of the screen was detached, that is, disconnected from the screen itself. I fixed it by gently pushing onto the rim, so the holders on the other side went inside the corpus where they belong.2. Sometimes, if I use a headset, the computer doesn't give audio output into earphones, but instead gives it to the speakers (sometimes both speakers and earphones at the same time). So I have to unplug headset and plug it in again. (RESOLVED)3. Touchpad works strange in double touch mode. It is supposed to implement mac-like scrolling with double touch, but it works only half of the time. I found that it works better if you touch it sort of ridiculously gentle, like almost to pressure at all. Well, anyway I don't use this function. (RESOLVED)Update-02/12/2013: Still very satisfied. Had no further problems, computer works very stable. Problem with headset has been solved in latest audio card patch. Touchpad scrolling works fine too, turns out I wasn't using it right: for bottom-up scrolling you are supposed to make double touch in vertical axis, but I was making in horizontal.Update-11/09/2013: Having the laptop over a year now. Never let me down (well, it crashed once when I connected it to a projector, but that was it). I started to notice though that speakers on some other laptops are far better than on this one, so if you're sensitive to this, you might consider something else. Same goes for the screen. If you plan to do some serious photo-editing, make sure you're comfortable with the screen. The screen is great actually, because it is matte. Not only it doesn't reflect much light, but also eyes do not tire so easy. But it does look a little more bleak compared to some glossy screens (e.g. the one of new macbooks).One of the great things about this laptop I've really appreciated when I got sick and lied in bed is that you can actually work with it on your laps or in bed. Unlike most laptops which get air from below, G75 draws air from the top and pushes it behind. It will never overheat and you can meliorate your fever suffering with some Skyrim play-through :) (good god this game is long.)", "Date": "July 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "nice machine", "Author": "Robert M. Matthews", "ReviewID": "R2PYSSYE8JVPWI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have only had this notebook for two days now and would like to focus this review on my first impressions and experiences with it.  I received it two days ago when I got home from work.  After charging the battery for a couple of hours I turned it on and it went through a process of setting up some things in Windows and I had to enter my wireless key.  Everything went smoothly.  I was surprised to see only five icons on the desktop-- Recycle Bin, Asus Vibe Fun Center (whatever that is)Asus Web Storage, eManual, and McAfee!  I suspected that there might be some anti-virus software lurking and sure enough, a one month free trial from McAfee which I had five days to activate!  Amazon didn't say anything about that.So, knowing I would need to have an anti-virus program, I went to the McAfee website to activate the temporary account and ended up buying a year's subscription online for around $70 and downloaded it.  Before it could download, McAfee had to first uninstall the free one month anti-virus trial program.  I guess if I opted out it would have been up to me to figure out how to uninstall it entirely before installing Norton.  Anyway, I bought it from them and everything seems OK.Now the first order of business was to create the four Recovery DVD's.  Using some HP DVD+R 4.7GB, the first DVD took 45 minutes to burn, the second and third 10 minutes each, and the fourth 7 minutes for a total of 72 minutes.  Had I checked the box \"Fully verify data when burning disc\" it would have been longer.After waiting through many Windows updates, the machine seemed to be functioning very well.  I downloaded Google Chrome and installed Adobe Lightroom 4 without any problems at all.  I noticed a previous reviewer had a blue screen due to playing a you tube music video, so I tried one from Little Richard and it worked perfectly.  If Richard can't give you a BSOD, nobody can!I was hesitant to get a 17 inch screen, thinking that it would be too small for gaming, but when you sit in front of this notebook it looks a lot larger than 17 inches!  I love it, and the matte finish is excellent, as is the illuminated keyboard (you can vary the intensity).  I feel very good about buying this notebook.  I originally ordered the model with the gtx 670 video card, but I had it backordered for ten days and nothing was happening, so I got this one.  I don't think it will matter much to me because I am more interested in photography than gaming, except when it comes to Thief.", "Date": "May 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "The machine runs like a dream", "Author": "Michael W.

I have not been much of a gamer so I cannot speak to that but I bought this laptop because of the reviews I have read over the years how the game machines are pretty close on par with workstations.I bought this to really focus on Corel Painter 12 to work on files that are pretty large and with higher resolution so that I might be able to produce limited edition gicles directly from the digital painting.  I am hoping this will be a step in the right direction.I am still in the process of installing programs onto the machine...but even this process seems to be lightning fast to my other computers.I read all the reviews so far so I wanted to add that my machine seems to work perfectly...no problems with the space bar and the feedback and comfort of the keyboard is great.I will add to this comment over the next few days as I begin to work in the programs I have.

Brailsford", "ReviewID": "R1UGHOAUCHZCGB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After doing a bit of research, reading the reviews, and comparing prices of other mid range and higher end systems out there, I decided on the ASUS G75VW-AH71 - the one with Windows 8, less Ram than the AS71, and a graphics card that was going to give me around 5 fps more on average - the NVidia GTX 670M.  The AS71 model is listed as coming with the 660M, and although there were some negative things about the 670M, the positives tipped the scales and I decided to fork out the extra $170.I got the laptop in the mail yesterday, and it is awesome.... except it has the 660M Video card.  I would not have paid an extra $170 for Windows 8 and half the RAM.  Especially when there are specials out there that let up upgrade 7 to 8 for as little as 15 bucks, and 8 gigs of ram is about $40.I've searched around, and can't find anything that says the 670M would show as a 660M in both device manager and through NVidia's online detection tool.  Everything out there says there are some issues with an updated driver, but those posts talk about the card being correctly detected as a 670M and not a 660M.I have contacted Amazon and we are working on an exchange.  I will update this review once I receive the exchange based on the video card and the exchange experience.  This is my first negative experience with a product ordered from Amazon - and although I'm not a frequent reviewer, I am a frequent buyer.Fingers Crossed I can update this to 5 stars!*********Update 11/16/12I received the replacement today via UPS.  Definitely a very fast turnaround time; however upon opening the machine, it's still got the 660M NVidia card.HOWEVERI called Amazon right away, and as with the previous call got a super helpful person on the line.  They offered another exchange and I brought up the possibility that the specs were not matching on the product page instead of that the laptop itself was wrong.  I will admit I was on hold off and on for a while, but the rep checked in with me regularly, and communicated really well about what was being done while he was away.  The customer service is definitely well beyond any company I have worked with as a consumer in the last 5 - 10 years.As I write this update, the product has the \"temporarily unavailable\" disclaimer due to the difference in product specs.  I was offered a full refund, but as I really DO like the laptop, and my only real concern was the price difference for a video card with less video RAM, and the additional $$ I spent to upgrade to 16 GB of system RAM, we worked out a deal that wasn't just to my satisfaction, it was well beyond my expectations.Thank You Amazon for making me feel like a valued customer without having to work for it.", "Date": "November 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Machine for the Price", "Author": "isbelldl", "ReviewID": "R1B8WUW7S28WB5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, a clarification. The specs listed are contradictory. The G75VW-AH71 as built is as follows:Intel Core i7-3630QM, 2.4GHzNvidia GeForce GTX 660M, 2GB17.3\" 1920x1080 @ 60HzWindows 8 x648GB, DDR3 RAM750GB Hard Drive (partitioned into 300GB C:, 400GB D:, 50GB restore/other)DVD DriveNow for my impressions:Overall, I'm happy with the computer. The screen is beautiful. The trackpad works well. I've been able to run Minecraft at max settings with 60+fps, & Mechwarrior Online at max settings around 25-30fps. The fans are quiet & effective. The case seems well built, & a large panel on the bottom provides easy access to the hard drive bays, 2 open RAM slots, & one of the fans. The other fan is accessible from a separate panel.The computer does have some minor issues, but nothing I can't deal with. They keyboard is mediocre. Not bad to type on, but not as good as the Vaio laptop I've used. Locating volume controls on fn+f10 through fn+f12 was a poor design choice. I would rather see them on fn+f2 through fn+f4, swapping places with keyboard brightness settings & the wireless switch. They're my most used fn command, & yet the hardest to reach. The home/pgup/pgdn/end layout is also a bit unintuitive to me. The one upside is a bump on the w key to help find wasd when gaming. The speakers are decent, but not great. The subwoofer receives a full range signal, & with the factory drivers may play even with headphones plugged in. Updated drivers will fix the headphones issue. Check the ROG forums for a link.In summary:Pros:- Good performance for price- Great screen- Stays cool & quiet- Seems well built- Easily accessible/upgradable RAM slots (2 of 4) & HDD bays- Raised bump on w key for wasd when gaming.- Decent trackpadCons:- Mediocre keyboard, not the greatest layout.- Mediocre speakers, must update drivers to work properly with headphonesI would buy this laptop again.Edit: Trackpad is much more responsive after turning off the delay in the PC Settings menu.

Charlemagne \"123\"", "ReviewID": "R3T5TX0ECY91OB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The ASUS G75VW is a great laptop - even if you aren't into gaming. The CPU and video card aren't the highest spec available, but they're 95% of the way there, allowing you to have a cooler running laptop and lower cost, while getting most of the performance the high end hardware have.The 1080p display is really good, my laptop had no dead pixels, the refresh rate is excellent, as is color reproduction. There have been several bad reviews about this laptop's display, but they appear to all come from the G75VW-BBK5 (a BestBuy specific model) which appears to use a different display than the other G75VW's. So buyer be warned when cross shopping.The 750 gig hard drive has multiple partitions, some users complain about it, or about the recovery partition being unusable. If you really must reclaim the space used by the recovery partition, please be aware that Microsoft's disk tool won't let you touch the recovery partition. There are multiple freeware software available that will let you delete it. This isn't ASUS's fault, it's just how MS deals with recovery disks.The keyboard has a chicklet style design. I was worried it would make it difficult to type on, but the keys are actually very nice to type with. The backlight on the keyboard is adjustable too.Some people have complained about the audio on the laptop - I haven't had any issue with it. The sound is quite nice, and as good as you can expect from small speakers in a small housing. Obviously you won't get full 7.1 surround sound that your $3000 home stereo would produce. The audio is clear, sharp, and even has decent base. I did note some audio break up at higher volume levels, but it's far from being an issue as the system is loud even at lower volume levels.The wireless card seems to work well. I have run it on mixed network as well as wireless-N only networks. Speeds have been good, no disconnects.The laptop has two big fan vents on the bottom. They not only push air out the back, but they're directly connected to the cpu/graphics card and cool them at the same time. They are big enough that they make virtually no sound when running (smaller fans will spin faster and make more buzzing sounds).The laptop has two hard drive bays. Only one is used for the AS71. They are accessible from the bottom of the laptop by removing a single screw. The laptop has full SATA3 specs. For $100, I purchased a 128gig SSD and placed it in the first slot. I then reinstalled Windows7. Boot up time is ten seconds for windows 7, and seven seconds for Fedora 17. The laptop is faster than my (first generation) i7 desktop which also has a SSD and 16 gig ram.With the above configuration, Windows Experience lists the laptop with:Processor: 7.6Graphics: 7.3Memory: 7.9Hard Disk: 7.9Max score is 7.9.The AS71 comes with all 4 ram slots used up - 4 gigs each, for a total of 16 gigs. This is supposedly the max amount of ram the laptop can use, but I've read on forums that users have been able to install 8 gig sticks of ram without issue (for a total of 32 gig).There are a few potential down sides to this laptop:1. The laptop is about 10 lbs, and the ac adapter is 2 lbs. While the display is 17.3\", the laptop itself is even larger than that. All of this makes the laptop bulky and difficult to transport. I don't think this is an issue for most as this is really a desktop replacement that can be portable when needed. I would not recommend it to someone who had to constantly move about.2. Battery life is just over 2 hours. Again, as with point #1, this is a desktop replacement, and shouldn't be directly compared with ultra mobile laptops that can get 10+ hours of life. The ultra mobile laptops wouldn't compare in performance to this either.3. The laptop lid is soft. I can press down on the lid and it gives. When opening the lid from the center, the top bezel will snap out of place (It doesn't look any different from normal) but I know it was out of place when I later shut the lid and a snapping sound is heard. The solution to this is to open the lid by grasping each top corner with your hands (instead of the center). The laptop is heavy enough that you can open the lid this way and it avoids bending the screen bezel.All in all, the only thing I would like to see is a firmer plastic (or metal) housing on the laptop. It's not to say that the laptop is flimsy or built poorly (It's designed quite nicely), I just don't like hardware that flexes, especially when it's by the display.There are a lot of pros, but you'll buy a laptop that best fits what you want to do with it. The only thing I'll mention as a pro is that most laptops that have a 3rd gen i7 laptop, 16 gigs of ram, 1080p display at 17.3\", will cost you upwards of $2000. My first choice wasn't ASUS (frankly at this price point, I was worried there would be extreme cost cutting that would result with a cheap laptop that wouldn't last), but after a lot of research, it was a toss up between this and the Samsung. Samsung's came with half the ram and so I opted to try the ASUS instead.

Whiffen", "ReviewID": "RIN6X9PHOOEHB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After owning an ASUS G75VW-AS71 for about 5 days, I am already extremely happy about my purchase.  After doing a lot of research before buying, this seemed to be an incredible deal and had the best specs out of all of the gaming laptops in the $1,200-$1,700 price range, as most of the \"higher end\" brands with the same load-out where at least $500 higher.  That is not saying there aren't any flaws, but most are cosmetic, or are very easy to live with.Pro's:- Great screen.  The anti-glare finish is very nice and does it's job very well.  I've seen many that were advertised to be didn't do a very good job.  Looks better while gaming than it does when there is a high contrast background (mostly white; office and the internet are the worst), but, at least for me, doesn't degrade the experience.- This rig is seriously fast.  Even with the stock 7200rpm drive it only takes about 15 seconds to boot to the login screen.  I have been playing sever very graphics heavy games on it and I have been impressed with its performance.  Company of Heroes runs flawless with all graphics settings maxed out.  I had a desktop with a mid-high end graphics card built in 2009 (3 years after the game came out) and it couldn't run the game on Med. settings when there where a lot of units on the screen.  Planetside 2 runs very well also.  Although it can't run on ultra settings without being a little jumpy, the game still looks great on med. with a few select options turned up to high.(somewhere in the 60-70fps range)- The cooling system is great.  I haven't tried to clean the filters yet, but it seems to be pretty easy and a very nice feature.  The fact that when cleaned on a regular basis, dust wont choke out the fans and heatsinks makes for a longer lifespan.  I have had many laptops that died because of degraded ventilation (granted 2 of them where 4-5 yr. old macbooks). The CPU and GPU have not gone above 36c even after 3+ hrs. of gaming.Con's:- There are at least 2 weak points on the casing. 1 is the optical drive bay; The body bends a little if you pick it up at that point.  It seems like a design flaw and isn't a huge deal once you know about it, to not pick it up at that spot.  2 is opening it up.  If you open it from the center the screen (probably just the casing) bows.  Again, not a problem once you know to open it from the corners.  Also, the screen is huge, once you think about it, it makes sense to spread the pressure points.- There is no physical copy of Win. 7 of a restore disk.  When i tried to restore onto a SSD, the ASUS backup and the widows backup didn't install cleanly. A Win. 7 disk included would have made this much easier.  (it does come with a disk of all ASUS drivers needed for a fresh install though)- It's heavy. This isn't necessarily a Con, but more of a reality with a gaming laptop of any brand, but in this day and age weight it a big selling point.- The Touchpad is in a slightly awkward spot.  While a touchpad is not ideal for gaming, it is what this laptop is made for, right? For general use it's fine, but while playing any game it seems very awkward. Instead of being on the left, with how the keyboard is laid out it would be better it it was to the right side, perhaps below the arrow keys and Num pad.  Again, not a big deal, more of a annoyance.Overall this is a great machine and a great buy.  The Pro's overwhelmingly outweigh the Con's.  I had been looking at a few different alienware setups and a bottom of the line origin, when I saw this ASUS it was almost a no brainer for the price difference and the better specs.  I have owned many ASUS products in the past, and while the warranty this machine has is great, if you're planning on getting it to be you primary machine for work, it does take some time to get you're product returned after repair/replacement.  That said, if speedy warranty work is what you need, look at purchasing from a reputable store with their own service contracts.", "Date": "January 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Everything it promised for me!", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R34DKU8XWD7QN0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This thing is a BEAST!

The processor, gfx card, and memory are the strengths of this computer, and contribute to its speedyness. The hard drive in this model, is the limiting factor. It is not a SSD and as such, it takes longer to boot-up and load games than my desktop does (which has an SSD in it). It is a 750gb hdd, which is not small, but not terribly big either. It will be just fine for me, however, if I need to expand with a second hard drive or even an SSD, there are easy access panels beneath the laptop which should make for an easy upgrade with a 2nd hard drive. I typically leave my laptop plugged in where ever I go, so I have not really used it only on battery power yet, and cannot comment on that.

I can run most games on max settings with max AA and not see any dip in framerate.Aesthetics - This laptops looks large and in-charge. It is power hungry, and shows it.Cons:Wifi - Wifi is intermittent on the RoG line of laptops. You can confirm this on the ASUS forums. Losing connectivity multiple times over the course of a day is annoying (especially when gaming).Graphics on battery power - This machine is HORRIBLE when forced to run on battery power. Although I don't plan on using it on batter often, it is a pain to struggle through a game in what looks like a slideshow.Backlit keyboard - Light bleeds through the keys. This looks cheap.Windows 8 - Ok. I have nothing bad to say about Windows 8. I actually like it. BUT - OEMs no longer include stickers on the bottom of machines so that you have access to your key. Good luck on installing Windows on a new hard drive without pirating a CD. ASUS was no help, nor was Microsoft.ASUS Software - The ASUS software would not install on my new ssd (thus new Windows install). I contacted ASUS and was alerted that I MUST be using the original HD for this to function.Overall a good laptop, but the shortcomings were not something I could not workaround.

I bought this one because it had way more power than the Best Buy edition, which was cheaper.  However, for 250 dollars more, you get 16 GB of the fasted RAM available for this laptop (1600 Mhz), a faster harddrive, and a FULL HD screen along with much better warranty offers from Asus and Square Trade if you want an extended warranty.  (I got one because my G50Vt-X1's graphics card died after only three years, and had problems long before it died from overheating.)  This laptop allows you to access the fan housing in order to clean out accumulated dust without voiding the warranty.  That is crucial to protecting the graphics card from overheating.  The dual fan assembly was a major reason I bought this laptop.That being said, it is equipped with a pathetic Atheros wireless network card that has an effective range of about 5 feet tops.  After wasting countless hours \"configuring\" Windows to recognize wireless networks all around me, I finally just unplugged it and carried it to the room with the transmitter and set it down about 3 feet from it -- instant internet access!  No more problems.  If you plan to use an ethernet cable, this laptop will probably be ok, but it cannot connect to wireless networks more than 5 feet away, so keep that in mind before buying.  It is a hardware issue, as many have compained about the Atheros nic card's lack of range.For gaming it does fine, which is what I bought it for.  I am still amazed that the intake air vents are on the bottom of the \"laptop\" since this guarrantees a constant inflow of lint and dust, or no air inflow at all.  When will they learn?I don't recommend carrying it around, as the weight is significant and just lifting it can damage the CD drive on the left side, which bends when I pick up the laptop.  I put it on a cooling fan platform just so I would not need to grip the laptop when moving it around.  I think this is really the first laptop that is truly a desktop replacement, as it is nearly as big as a desktop itself.  The screen is great!  I really do like it and I like that it can be connected to an even larger screen if need be.I think my sons will enjoy playing games on this laptop, and I do recommend the laminated skin they are offering since the rubber surface is not easy to clean once there is an oily fingerprint on it.  (I think they knew that).  I also recommend a wireless bluetooth mouse instead of using the trackpad, but I do like the positive click of the pad buttons.  The backlit keyboard is a great idea for late night usage when others are asleep.So, for the money, I think this is a pretty good deal.  I am giving it a 4 because of the weak wireless card that will make it difficult or impossible to connect to the internet unless you have your own transmitter nearby.  Since I do not plan to use it for internet surfing, this is not an issue for me, but might be a serious issue for others.UPDATE:  After taking my laptop to the public library, I set it up as far as possible from the wireless transmitter, and it did detect the network and connected to it, but the signal strength was poor.  As I moved it toward the router, it improved, but never reached full signal strength.  It did work fine at the library, but then there were no walls involved.  I think this network card will only work with routers close by, but it does seem to work.  It is not nearly as good as my G50vt-x1 wireless network card, which I am using to write this from home.

Wanted a powerful machine to run gaming (e.g. Mass Effect, Assassin's Creed series) + heavy photo processing. The machine is great - unlike other laptops (even the Alienware), the fans are positioned properly so it doesn't overheat even after many hours of gaming. Can run all the games on mostly high full graphics (the games do stutter a bit on really busy scenes) -- turning down heavy anti-aliasing and super high shadows take care of any slowdowns.The only drawbacks are: - The HDD maxes out at 750GB (at least when I bought it in 2012) -- way too small for such a powerhorse (my Alienware laptop had 2TB). HDD options should be increased. - The built-in speakers are really crappy. Yes, I do have external speakers, but for those times when I'm moving around, the internal speakers are really tinny. Yes, I know they're internal, but expected them to be a bit better. - No dedicated/hard button for volume control. With so much multimedia available, it's very useful to have dedicated hard buttons for volume control. The only way to control volume is either through the volume icon in Windwos or by using Fn+F10/F11, quite a cumbersome method.Note that the laptop is HUGE -- I have not yet found a laptop bag that can fit it.

When I first turned it on I noticed that the fans had a grinding sound.  When moving the computer a few ways I noticed that it would do this when I sat it on a table.  This was caused by the fans not sitting properly.  My fix was to remove the bottom, and very carefully pull the fans out (bottom of the computer facing upwards).  Just lifting them like that helped to get them to sit right and the noise to vanish.  I noticed online that a good amount of people had this issue, and I had wished someone would have said what I just said now.  Hopefully this helps you.The only other issue I've had from time to time is that when I have a headset plugged in it doesn't always feed directly to the headset.  I can still sometimes hear whatever is making sound through the speakers.  The plus side is that the speakers are awesome.  To fix this I just unplugged and plugged in the headphones a few times.  Never took more then 5 tries.GREAT COMPUTER.  If you can afford it I would strongly recommend it.  I did extensive research, and this was by far the best.

Whenever I play Diablo 3 on the switchable ATI card on HP Envy17, it will result in certain thermal shut down, with or without the aid of a cooling pad.  The Asus G75vw, does not.  Heck, I don't even need a cooling pad for it.  Granted, it may have to do with the poor programing of the game, as when I played Elder Scolls: Skyrim, it rarely shut down (w/cooling pad).  But still...2.  Whenever the switchable ATI card on Envy17 is being used in multimedia/gaming, it sounds like a hair-dryer (low setting).  The Asus?  Quiet as always.3.  After using the Envy 17 for a while (ATI), the left side gets alarming hot.  I guess that is where the GPU resides.  The Asus?  Cool to the touch.4.  The HP Envy 17 has a good screen, but glossy.  Very reflective.  Asus uses matte screen.  Although colors are not as vibrant as HP, but in the long run, easy on the eye and reduce eye strain.5.  It may be thicker than the HP Envy 17, but due to its wedge shape, front thin, and gradually gets fatter towards the rare, it is actually not that much thicker.  It is certainly slimmer than its older cousins, the G74/G73 series.6.  Finally, it has 3x USB 3.0 ports + Display port + VGA (useful for occasional work).7.  The track-pad is greatly improved and responsive, unlike that of the Envy17, which is un-usable.The Bad:1.  How the heck do I replace the wireless module?  The default Athero chip only supports 2.4Ghz wireless N band, not the 5Ghz band.  Which is lame.  I need it to stream HD contents and sync large files with my WHS server.  I want to replace it with an Intel one that does.  But it appears Asus moved it to the top, beneath the keyboard now (I assume).  This, will make DIY like me cringe.  Without a service manual, I don't want to open it in fear that I may break something in the process.  Bad design.  Anybody got a manual?2.  Still using a tray loading optical drive.  Come on Asus, I would much prefer you omit the optical drive.  Or at least do what HP Envy 17 does:  slot loading.  It will strengthen the overall laptop chasis as well.3.  No switchable graphics?  Where is Nvidia Optimus?  Mine is not the 3D version, so it should be able to.  Wasted the great built-in intel 4000 series graphics.  Also, it will greatly reduce its battery life.  On my HP Envy 17, I could get over 7 hours surfing in power saving mode using extended battery.4.  After cleaning install on an SSD, I can not seem to get the hot keys working.  I install the proper keyboard filter/ATKACPI/hotkey drivers.  Why won't it work?  Annoying.  I must have missed something.5.  The audio output via headphone is problematic.  I use external speakers.  I often have to disconnect it and reconnect it to enable the sound output to go to the headphone port, not the internal speakers.  A software bug, Asus?Overall, I am still very happy with this laptop.  I love its matte and muted design.  Very serious looking, not flashy like that of MSI GT70, its closet competitor.Update:Now that I have had it for over a month now, still love it.1.  The hotkeys work now.  I guess I have to press the Fn key + the corresponding keys.2.  Finally found on the web how to open the system up to swap the wireless module.  Since I will upgrade it with an intel 6300, I will have to wire the 3rd antenna under the LCD bezel too.  Looking forward to it.3.  The sound issue is increasing annoying.  Very annoying.  Will there be a fix for it?  I think I will contact Asus Support.Update 2:1.  I finally replace the stock wireless module with an Intel 6235 one.  Well worth taking it apart, I would say.  Also, Asus placed the screw specs next to the holes was very helpful.  Kudos to Asus.2.  I finally solved the audio issue:  update to newest firmware seemed to have fixed it.  But I bought a used Creative USB sound card and it sounded much better and worked beautifully.  Since the laptop will be sitting on the desk as a desktop replacement, it worked out fine.Still love it.  No problem, quiet, and works fine.

Though when in a quiet situation this can be obnoxious and disturbing to others around you. this is really the only complaint I have, WTF ASUS.)EVERYTHING ELSE RUNS SMOOTH WITHOUT PROBLEMS FOR ME. I use it for everything that I used my desktop for and get comparable performance, perfectly acceptable consider I can now carry my work around with me! I can edit HD video (Sony Vegas, After Effects, Premier Pro all run fine on this for me), I can edit photos (Photoshop), 3DS Max. You name it, it runs decent on this thing without heat issues.THE SCREEN IS BRIGHT AND SURPRISINGLY COLOR ACCURATE. This is a big plus for me. I really love the brightness and color of this screen! WHITE IS WHITE, daylight is no problem. Matte finish is nice.I like the materials the laptop is made of. I really like the design (though I could do without the Gaming Republic insignia all over). It isn't over-the-top like the MSI. It's all black/dark grey and nicely refined.The GTX 670m is decent, though I wish it were a 680m. Hopefully ASUS continues with this line and comes out with the 780m soon! It can't play Crysis 3 on ultra-extreme but it's good enough for me.I've had friends with new alienwares who experience many problems. This ASUS is well built and full of great hardware that has yet to fail me.

I ordered it with win 8 but I put win 7 on via a USB stick.  First problem I had to solve is that the bios is not updated and will not recognize USB 3.0 devices properly.  You can get the bios update from asus website and there is a easy flash utility (usually escape or del key as computer is starting will get you into the bios setup).Next problem was that the touchpad software driver from asus is incomplete.  You will notice that it is difficult to do 2 finger scrolling as you have to hold fingers to pad for a sec.  The solution is to disable the smart touch feature in the ps2/mouse pointing device settings when you open the settings from the touchpad taskbar icon.Next, the touchpad software will not allow you to 2 finger tap to open new links, etc which is a bummer if you are used to websurfing like that.  The solution is to go into registry editor and find the key under currentuser->software->synaptic-> and in one of the subfolders there will be the keys for 2fingertap and 3fingertap which you can change the value to 2 or 4 to make the action open a new link in a tab or see the properties window like a right click.Otherwise the laptop is fast.  I definitely recommend taking off the win 8, it is an embarrassment from microsoft.

Spacey and you have lots of shortcuts!-Trackpad. Requires some tweaking, mostly with the \"asus smart detector.\" Make the detection circle as big as possible/custom. If you need even more responsiveness check it off. With the right adjustments, the trackpad can come close to an apple. It doesn't have the apple 2 finger right click, but I like the quick minimize function. The apple 2 finger scrolling works best with the \"asus smart detector\" turned off.-Good Price.-Runs cool.Bad:-Speakers are HORRIBLE. I thought people were being too picky when commenting about the bad sound. I concur that the sound is crap. Totally different class from the ipads/apple sound system. Don't expect anything close to the macs. You'll get better sound on dells. The company states that these are \"hd premium speakers\" Don't believe it, more like 50 cent crap, and tweaking them don't do much. With that said, you can still watch youtube videos. With music, movies, and games, you better hook up your own speakers or headphones.-Scrolling is very jerky. If you want smooth mac scrolling you need to download third party software, and even then.. However, there is a free extension for google chrome that's pretty good. But, for all other applications your eyes may hurt, if you're used to apple.-Screen. Viewing angle is small and not as clear as I expected. But, for the budget price, it's good enough.Overall:May not be as clean as the Macs, but it costs $1000.00+ less!

The keyboard lights would light up and attempt to fully power up but it would shut off after a few seconds. The screen wouldn't turn on. What really pissed me off is that you have to pay out of pocket to ship your product to a service center. If I pay $1500 for an FN laptop, the company should ship you a no shipping cost box.

The pixels on the screen are very noticeable, i have tried to tweek all the contrast ratio and resolution changes, even at the highest 1920 x 1080 resolution, the screen looks like looking though a \"bug screen\" that you use to keep bugs out of your room.The pixels are less noticeable on dark images, however, especially on white backgrounds such as web most web pages, and visual studio, the perfectly square pixels are very noticeable.

Even if you have warranty, it is very inconvienent to have to post it back to Asus and not be able to use it. Don't buy this if you are going to use it for buisness or study. It could cost you a lot. The cost of a large parcel for a 5kg item is expensive and it adds extra cost. This whole experience has been very costly for me. I have a 5 year old Compaq Presario, that I'm forced to use and its still working, but Asus died after 2 days. It's pathetic.Look at all the topics on the Asus ROG forum and other reviews complaining about the sound. I discovered that myself. When you plug the headphones in, the speaker keeps working when you don't want it to. Asus hasn't done a thing about this.A lot of people check out the negative reviews before they buy something and I hope this negative review will cost Asus thousands of dollars in lost buisness, that is the least they deserve.
