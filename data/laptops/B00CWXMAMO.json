I am still working on loading downloads to the hard drive, so I haven't been able to do a lot of different things on it, yet.  Everything I have done is working great and really like it.  Still doing adjustments like I want and they are all working fine.  This is all I can say at this time.  I like it....", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Will Never Buy A Sony Computer Again", "Author": "Michael W. Walton \"Deaf Guy\"", "ReviewID": "R256Y76KSJ4PJ4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Back in summer of 2012, I bought our daughter a Vaio laptop similar to this one.  It's been working great for her so we decided to get this one for ourselves.  I tried finding this one again but couldn't.  We only paid $700 for hers, but because we couldn't find it and found this one, we actually ended up paying more for it ($1,000).  We'll never get one ever again.First, there's a lot of junk ware on it.  For example, the only way to dim the screen is to make sure that the Vaio Care junk ware is running.  If you disable it, you actually cannot control the dimming of the screen any more.  This is really outrageous when you think about it.Second, this Vaio Care junk just eats up resources and constantly pops on prompts and alerts, which is terribly aggravating.Third, even after installing all of the latest Windows 7 updates, I notice that this one actually runs slower than my daughter's.  Both of them have 8 GB of RAM, but web surfing and so on seems to take longer.Fourth, and one of the more aggravating things about ours, the mousepad on the laptop does not work well.  Whenever you slide your finger around to move the cursor, and then you stop, when you remove your finger, the cursor jerks and moves away from where you originally positioned it.  It seems like a defect.  Also, the entire mousepad is slightly loose so that when you're moving your finger over it, you can feel the entire pad shifting around ever so slightly in its casing.The only two things we do like about it are the built-in webcam and the keyboard that lights up, making it easier to type in low light.  After the good things we liked about our daughter's laptop, this one was a really big letdown.Update - I truly and sincerely regret purchasing this laptop.  It's slow and when I browse the internet it's like I'm doing so with a 56k modem, even though I have broadband.  It's a joke and i'll probably someday give it to my son and buy an Alienware.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00CWXMAMO"}}
