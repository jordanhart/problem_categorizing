I don't see the need in them. But when Microsoft announced the Surface Pro I thought maybe in the future I'd be willing to change my laptop for a full PC capable tablet. Well, that future is now.I'd been toying the idea of a Vaio Duo, second gen. That thing is a piece of beauty. But a very pricey one. Then they introduced the Flip, which is more laptop than the Duo and came in more accessible models. From the moment I saw one at a Sony Store I knew I'd be getting one.On to the specs. I've been using Intel i5 and 4GB of memory, and it has held up pretty good until now, but you have to adjust for the changing times and now 8GB is just barely O.K. and an i5 is not as fast as these times has gotten us used to. Also, I want to use this as a tablet as much as a laptop. I want to be able to run with this turned on and keep the hard drive intact. And the only way to do that is with no hard at all. Solid state is pretty expensive, and 256 GB is not that much, but I decided I could do with just space for the files being used in the present and have everything else archived in the external HDD I've already got. Also, the trend is to have everything in the Cloud now, anyway.Flipping the screen at first seems a little awkward; you don't want to break anything. After a while you get used to it. Just like it is with Windows 8. An active pen was included and it is both great and necessary: your finger doesn't have all the functions of a mouse.So far, no complaints, just raw awesomeness. I sure hope Sony is making PCs again by the time I need another.Some tips:- A screen protector from ArmorSuit for the Vaio Duo 13 fits very well after a few modifications.- The Vaio Slipcase 13 is O.K. for carrying it but it does come in a little too tight.- Buy it refurbished and save a buck. I did so from PcBase USA and haven't had any kind of trouble. The notebook came as if it was directly from Sony. I'd recommend them a thousand times.", "Date": "May 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Super Fast & Lightweight ( Love this new baby! )", "Author": "Speedster99", "ReviewID": "R1RK0POOC7OHCS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This one is by far one of the fastest laptops I have ever owned. I bought mine from Best Buy but paid more for it. The SSD does magic. It's very light and I like the Tablet and PC mode. It's very handy to \"flip\" it to tablet mode. Get it?
