Fix Included here", "Author": "Willy B.", "ReviewID": "R2W2PYOFT8NXUL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop for my Sister who is fairly computer illiterate, however I thought with a little time she would be able to figure it out. In addition, I wanted to check it out for myself being it is a new concept and being the nerdy IT guy in the family, I just had to fiddle with it. I like it! It does take some getting used to as others have mentioned (Touchpad is a learning curve, but nothing a usb mouse can't fix if your struggling). The laptop basically is a tablet that is much easier and faster to navigate and use(If your used to a PC). I chose the solid state drive because I thought the less moving parts the better and quieter. I haven't much time on it yet to give a really in depth review however I did come across a big problem with it after just one week that I wanted to share with everyone. The keyboard just stopped working out of the blue one day! Actually what occurred was the keys changed characters and you would get another letter when striking any key (ex. L would produce an R?)which unfortunately rendered the laptop completely useless. I could not troubleshoot it on my own even for a minute with this kind of problem. So I opted to reach out to Acer customer service via their on-line support chat. The support tech was nice however it seemed to me I just knew a little more about laptops than he did. Long story short, I had to put my 2 cents into the conversation in order for him to agree to offer something other than sending it back for repair. I was able to get them to provide a step by step re-load of the Chrome operating system which did fix the laptop! I have included those steps here in case anyone runs into a similar problem and does not want to send theirs back for repair. (See below:)Additionally I have found that the laptop consistently loses the wifi connection and I have to restablish a connection often. I have had some issues with my wireless routers recently as well so this may be a mute point but I thought it was worth mentioning. All in all I like it so far and even though we've had some breaks along the way, they were fixable ones. It is working fine now and I would still reccommend the laptop for web surfing, FB, music & video streaming etc.Here are the re-install steps from Acer support:** One caveat is that I believe these steps below are specific to the solid state drive version and not a SATA drive version so please beware of your version beforehand!The following steps outline how you reinstall Chrome OS by erasing the stateful partition:1. Turn off your Chromebook.2. Press and hold the esc key and refresh (F3) key and then press the power key to turn on the Chromebook.3. The Chromebook will boot to Developer Mode.  Press the ctrl key and the d key to turn off OS verification.4. When prompted to turn OS verification off, press the enter key.5. The Chromebook restarts.6. At the OS verification is OFF screen, do not press the Spacebar.  The recovery process will start automatically after approximately 15 seconds.7. The Chromebook begins erasing the stateful partition.  This process takes about 5 minutes.  A progress bar appears at the top of the screen.8. The Chromebook restarts and prompts to re-enable verification.  Press the spacebar key.9. Press the enter key to confirm you wish to turn OS verification on.10. OS verification is back on and Chromebook reboots automatically.11. The \"Welcome!\" screen will be displayed and you can complete the OOBE.", "Date": "August 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Delightful and versatile computer for a great price---this is the right Chromebook to buy", "Author": "R. Tupelo Schneck", "ReviewID": "R2HDKI0OUIXYBE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update, December 2013: at this point, almost all users should get the Acer C720 Chromebook instead of any of the C710 models.Update: the Acer C710-2833 is being replaced by the Acer C710-2834.  Go there for the $199 machine sold by Amazon!  (If the shipping delay on the 2834 is too long, and the cost of the 2833 is over $199 at Amazon, note that Best Buy and Newegg still have the 2833 for $199.)Thank goodness---Amazon is finally offering the Acer C7 directly at the canonical $199 price!  I'm moving my big Acer C7 review (with the appropriate new information for the changed hard drive) from its original home at Acer C7 C710-2847 Chromebook.Executive summary: $199 is a great price.  Chrome OS is quite an interesting and enjoyable computing environment which serves a wide range of needs (close to all of my family's computer use for sure).  The Acer C7's performance is noticeably better than that of the $249 Samsung ARM Chromebook for certain things, notably 720p video and Flash games.  Plus, the Acer can be opened up and upgraded, unlike the Samsung.  Along with \"cheaper\" those are basically the only areas in which the Acer beats the Samsung, but those made my decision for me.  The major flaws of the Acer C7 are the tiny hard-to-use cursor keys, and the downright horrible speakers; the major flaws of Chrome OS, for me, are local network file access and limited supported media formats.  Those are significant problems, but for $199 they are not showstoppers.I'm quite fond of my Acer C7 Chromebook.  The overwhelming feature is the price.  $199!Chrome OS offers a zero-maintenance solution to having a second computer around for family members who essentially only need a web browser anyway.  I've come to really enjoy using it.  I enjoy knowing that I will never need to provide much tech support for it.A potential buyer of the Acer C7 might also be considering the $249 Samsung ARM Chromebook.  I think the Samsung Chromebook is substantially more beautiful, has no fan, and has a much better keyboard and speaker.  However, it is underpowered.  At Best Buy I was able to try them side by side.  The Acer was able to handle 720p video from YouTube almost (though not quite) perfectly; on the Samsung dropped frames were much more noticeable.  I also tried a Flash game, Bloons Tower Defense 5, which I've noticed is surprisingly stressful for my older laptops.  It runs fine on the Acer C7, but is very choppy on the Samsung.  Finally, it is easy (if potentially warranty-breaking) to expand the RAM on the Acer C7 up to 16GB (!), and even to replace the hard drive (probably not necessary for most users).  The Samsung ARM Chromebook is essentially impossible to upgrade.  That, for me, was the clincher.The Acer C7, though not actually ugly, is not a particularly pretty machine.  The plastic around the display has a particularly cheap look-and-feel.  The hinge at least feels strong.  The display itself is reasonably nice, with a decent viewing angle.  It's glossy.I do not like the keyboard.  I think overall it's not a great keyboard (especially compared to the Samsung ARM Chromebook which has a lovely pleasant-to-use keyboard).  The really awful thing is the cursor keys, which are startlingly small and also scrunched up with the page up and down keys.  It is really, really unpleasant to use the cursor keys on this keyboard.  There are other oddities, if not real problems.  The Enter key is oddly shaped for no apparent reason other than gratuitous ugliness.  The keyboard has a Fn key, the only purpose of which is to have a Wifi-Disable keypress Fn-F11 (did anyone really need that?) and to send function keys over Chrome Remote Desktop (I suppose someone might need that---but I regret having a whole key for it in prime territory).  This keyboard puts extra Chrome OS Search keys down with the Control and Alt keys, which is unusual in Chrome OS devices, but it does work to my benefit as it sends Command to Macs over Chrome Remote Desktop.  In case it helps anyone, right-Control also sends Command.I like the Chrome OS keys for back, forward, refresh, full screen, and next window.The touchpad is quite a bit more resistant to clicking than I would like.  I use tap-to-click instead, but there's no tap-only variant of click-and-drag.  (I want the 3-finger drag from Apple.)I often use this Chromebook attached to an external display (and keyboard and mouse... think of it as a desktop replacement!).  When I first posted this review I mentioned some issues with this configuration.  A Chrome OS update in mid-February 2013 fully resolved these issues for me.  The OS auto-update feature is delightful, by the way, automatic and non-intrusive.With an external Mac keyboard, Command sends Control, which is great for someone whose hands are used to Mac key shortcuts.The absolute worst thing about the Acer C7 is the speakers.  They are bad.  Really, really, bad.  They're quiet and tinny and I can hardly stand to listen to them.  I'm no audiophile, either---I think almost anyone who uses this machine will cringe a little bit at the sound quality.  Was this really necessary to hit this price point?  Be prepared to use headphones or external speakers.  (And not Bluetooth external speakers... I'm told they are not supported in Chrome OS at all, and this machine doesn't have Bluetooth anyway.)The fan is audible.  Not awful, but this is no silent machine.This newer Acer C7 C710-2833 has a 16GB SSD instead of the old 320GB spinning hard drive.  This is a good thing---many users will see more benefits from a small fast silent SSD than from a big slow noisy hard drive!  Some thoughts in case you're worried about little disk space: As far as I can tell the only filesystem access you get is your Downloads folder.  Which the OS is allowed to clear at will to free up space!  Chrome OS was designed for minimal local storage, and frankly I don't see how much more space will ever be that useful.  I suppose there's the \"load it up with movies before the car trip\" argument.  But in general I think most users will benefit more from a silent, fast, tiny SSD for normal use; you can bring your movies on an external hard drive.I wish it had USB 3.0.  Oh well.  (Another point in favor of the Samsung ARM Chromebook, there.)On to software.  You can use the Web.  You can get a terminal with Control-Alt-T and use ssh (but no real local shell).  Chrome Remote Desktop is entirely usable.  Google Cloud Print seems to work fine, for those of us who have an always-on computer around anyway.  Offline Gmail and Google Docs are great if you sometimes lack internet access.  Flash games work fine.  Google Hangouts has a dumb name but is a fantastic videoconferencing product (the camera and microphone are fine).While I'm on Chrome Remote Desktop: You'll want to right-click the app icon to get it to \"open as window\", because if it opens as a tab Chrome itself will consume keypresses like control-N and control-W instead of sending them to the remote host.One thing that is lacking is the ability is access network file storage.  We have an always-on computer filled with video and audio and I'd like to be able to access those files conveniently.  What I've done that's workable is started an FTP server on that machine.  But it's not a great interface, and each file has to be downloaded before playing, rather than being streamed.  \"Sneakernet\" via USB drive works fine too of course.  I think there is pay software, like TVersity, that will set up a media server for you with a nice HTTP interface, but I haven't tried it.  And I wish this was built in.Media playing is a mixed bag.  This is irritating... why can't every computer just come with a player as nearly universal as VLC?  I haven't had trouble with audio; it seems to play my various mp3, m4a, flac, and wav files just fine.  Video is trickier.  It seems to play mp4 files happily.  It will play some avi files, but not others.  Wmv files don't work.  For the somewhat technically proficient: you can convert to Chromebook-playable MP4 using various products, like Handbrake or VLC, or the command-line tool ffmpeg: \"ffmpeg -i file.avi -c copy file.mp4\", \"ffmpeg -i file.avi -qscale 5 -strict -2 file.mp4\", and \"ffmpeg -i file.wmv -qscale 2 file.mp4\" are three simple sets of options I've found useful.  Frankly having to learn about ffmpeg is, again, irritating; this should just work.You can enter Developer Mode using a particular keystroke during bootup.  This gives you a root shell which potentially allows all kinds of fun.  It also wipes all storage in your \"stateful partition\", so don't do this after filling up your hard drive with things you want (generally unlikely).  The wiping also happens on leaving Developer Mode.  Developer Mode also makes Netflix stop working.  After playing with this for a bit I decided I didn't really need it.  I like that it's there... the principle of the device being unlocked is pleasing to me.  But in the end the clean, minimal, just-works built-in Chrome OS is essentially what I want from this machine.Conclusion: At higher prices Chrome OS is an oddball.  At $199 Chrome OS is a remarkable new paradigm in computing.  It's pleasant to use, and for $199, the various hardware and software flaws aren't bad enough to give me much pause.  In fact, for $199, if you're at all tempted, you might as well buy it and see for yourself.  A reason to pause would be to consider the $249 Samsung ARM Chromebook, which has significantly better aesthetics and might be a better choice for some people.  For me, the Acer C7's better performance for 720p video and Flash gaming, plus the ability to upgrade memory and hard drive, makes it the winner.", "Date": "August 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect For A Secondary Computer", "Author": "Jacob", "ReviewID": "R1VBTNEMJDAE9A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Acer Chromebook is great as an alternate computer.

In only a couple of weeks, it has become mostly a dust-catcher. Every time it goes to sleep or I wander awa for 10 minutes it loses the internet connection and it cannot be reconnected unless it is powered down and re-started. Now I know it isn't a hardware problem, because I now find out Chrome has had this problem for a couple of years now, whether Acer or not. I'm pretty angry. It may be inexpensive, but $200 is significant money to me. This is supposed to be a simple-to-use option. After going to the kitchen for a cup of coffee I've often lost the connection. Sigh. Turn it off, turn it back on. So frustrating. I've spent considerable time on the net trying to find a fix (which even if it had worked I should not have to do) and tried everything that I found suggested. No luck. People who are not techies should be able to use this and Google should have addressed it by now. Of course, not everyone has the issue.

It turns on automatically when you open the lid and within 6 to 8 seconds your at the desktop.  It also came with 100gb free storage on google drive for 2 years, so that is a big bonus.  I like how since it has a Solid state drive i can carry it around and pick it up and set it down without worrying about messing up a hard drive. The Chrome operating system is sooo simple to use as well, unlike my Surface RT, I absolutely hate the windows RT operating system.  I was slightly worried about the fan always running and being loud but i have only noticed it when Chrome was doing a system update.  I was also worried that it was going to feel really cheap and flex alot as the CNET review mentions, but I personally dont think it feels cheap at all.If i had to say anything negative about it, it would be the lack of an optical drive, but Its not that big of a deal as i rarely need one.

I needed something for my girlfriend to use at home, stat. Picked this up with low expectations, and it's been a relatively great little piece of tech. I waited until this SSD version became available - no need for an hdd on this device. We already used chrome apps and sync, so it was a pretty smooth transition. Being Mac users, I thought we'd miss many apps and all the nice UI points we're used to. In practice, I only miss my mac keyboard, 1password, and textexpander. There are things that the chromebook isn't made for; like adobe creative suite; video editing, any document work that isn't google docs friendly, and coding (although you can run a shell in chrome and code in the cloud).But the biggest surprise was how well this little guy handles the most common internet activities. It performs great for time on social networks, email, banking, writing, blogging, watching videos (this unit handles Netflix out of the box), and plugging into the TV via hdmi and watching videos (easier than the mac). It's biggest downsides for us are no skype (google hangouts are better anyway, but when your friends or clients are on skype, it's a pain), no GoTo Meeting (or any java apps), no dropbox (web viewer can cut it for some stuff), and the lack of some apps we've become accustomed to (Keynote, Tweetbot, Evernote app, etc.).All in all it's amazing that you get a fully usable laptop for 80-99% of what you need for so little.

Before I bought this, I had an iMac, an iPod touch, and a basic cell phone. I wanted something that I could browse the internet with and do a bit of word processing on that I could take anywhere but didn't want to spend much, so I decided to get this instead of a tablet since I already have a tablet-like device (my iPod touch) and wanted something that was more for media creation than consumption. While this is definitely not a replacement for a computer, if you already have a desktop and just want something that lets you take a full-size browser with you and will allow you to efficiently type via its keyboard (a major feature tablets are missing), then this is definitely a device you should consider getting.Like I said before, this is NOT a replacement for a Mac or Windows computer since there are essentially only five apps: Chrome (obviously), a notepad, a file browser, a calculator, and a webcam camera app. There are a couple more standalone apps you can download, but the majority of \"apps\" are just links to webpages, so they are not really worth downloading since you can just bookmark pages that you visit frequently. While the Chrome OS is very streamlined and well thought-out, know that there are many things you will not be able to do on it. That being said, Chrome OS runs very smoothly even when you have a lot of Chrome tabs open and I never experienced any slowdowns, even before I upgraded the RAM to 6 GB by adding a 4 GB RAM module to its empty RAM slot (which hopefully didn't void the warranty in the process since I had to remove the seal above the one screw that holds the entire bottom panel on). I really enjoy browsing the web on this and it is super easy to transfer files between this and a computer when you put them on an SD card in the card slot, but the battery life on this is pretty disappointing. Even at a full charge with the brightness turned down, you will ONLY get around three hours of battery life, which is very meager for a brand new device that should be capable of holding a decent charge (right now, for instance, I have  2 hours and 28 minutes of battery left even though it still has a 68% charge). The build quality of this machine is decent and it feels pretty solid, although it is certainly not as well-built as a MacBook Air that costs $800 more.Overall, if you want a small and portable web browser with a physical keyboard, this device would be a great option for you. I do feel slightly uncomfortable that Google has so much of my personal information, such as all my bookmarks and extensions (I do not sync my history, tabs, or passwords with my computer), but it's not like they wouldn't have most of this information anyway, and there are workarounds for giving them less of your personal data, such as just typing on one Google Doc and transferring your text to Word after you finish working on something on your Chromebook. While there are certainly things you cannot do on this, there are workarounds for most things you would want to do, such as uploading all your music to Google Play (free for  up to 20,000 songs) as a way to access your iTunes library, among others you will figure out as you become more familiar with the Chrome OS ecosystem. If you're in the market for this or a tablet and already have a smartphone, I would recommend this, for while it doesn't have many apps, it gives you a more traditional and productive computing experience than a consumption-oriented and most likely more expensive tablet.Update 1: The computer now has a dead pixel near the top center of the screen which is not noticeable most of the time but is still incredibly annoying. I checked Acer's policy on dead pixels and just like Apple and I would assume the industry as a whole, a few dead pixels are, to them, acceptable and not grounds for repair, so I will just have to live with it for as long as I keep the computer.Update 2: The computer's fan now runs constantly after it initially warms up. The Chromebook Central group on Google recommended that I remove some of the RAM so I removed the original 2 GB module but it is still running constantly now (I even tried using it with just its original 2GB of RAM again and it still runs constantly), which makes it impractical to use in class or in other quiet environments where there is no background noise.

Like any device, there is a learning curve and I am still learning about the capabilities of my chromebook.  So far, I have found nothing to dislike.  OK, one thing I dislike it that the battery lasts only 3 hours tops.  Other than that, I have hooked this up to my TV and watch Netflix with the hdmi cable, I have downloaded pictures with my flashdrive.  Use Pixir app to edit photos.  I can't figure out why anyone gives the chromebook one star unless they didn't read up on this first to see what it can and can't do.  It does everything I want it to do so I love it. It has a cool adjustable (yet blulky) plug so you can adjust it depending on what angle to plug it in. My advice is to understand what it is you want from your \"computer\", do some research and if you decide a chromebook is for you, then it is perfect. If there is something I can't figure out, I just youtube my question and I can usually find easy short videos (such as turning on the mirror screen to watch Nexflix on my tv).  Start up takes seconds! I bypassed paying $50.00 more for the Samsung because I didn't need bluetooth, the one extra port wasn't needed and I wanted a glossy screen (the Samsung is matt).

You can put a full blown Linux OS which I have & (I even ran windows only programs my self using a program called wine).Now you have to do a little (a very small) tinkering to do it but it really isn't that hard, just follow the instructions here:[...]you can also just google ChrUbuntu and it will come up. Now i understand that ppl don't want to have to go through the trouble of installing chrubuntu which is why I am speaking to ppl who can. I never even used Linux before installing it on my Chromebook. I choose to learn because of budget & simplicity. just make a recovery on +4gb flash drive on your Chromebook before trying using this method:[...]If you mess anything up while doing Linux or even if you weren't messing with it but it messed up, this will fix almost everything by doing a full reset & installing a fresh OS on your Chromebook. just turn off your CB(chromebook), press & hold esc + f3(refresh button) & a screen will come up & then you just insert your flash drive that you formatted for recovery & within a few seconds it start the reset. you will hear the fan get louder than normal, which is what always happens so no worry.now for the things I've done using ChrUbuntu are:downloaded torrents,use Microsoft office, use Bluetooth!,watch any movie i got from the piratebay no matter what format using the program VLC, read different format eBooks, print any document via USB CABLE not the WEB!,stream videos to my ps3 using a server program. so this CB can do anything a windows pc can & even better using LINUX. IT can even run windows itself (although not recommended because of the low end processor), or any windows program you can think that you want using WINE (recommend) I've tested for myself using Microsoft Office & using Mine-craft.i even plan on buying 2gb of ram & a bigger solid-state drive 64gb instead of the 16gb that come with this. I used an external HDD for downloads from the piratebay. now with those upgrades i can put a good big number of Linux programs on it . all downloads i put in the external drive since HDD's are much cheaper for storage but SSD is better for performance.SO far I've had no problems with my CB. never died on me like others have stated & I've done more to my CB than them with installing Linux. so even if any problems occur you can always just pop in the flash drive & you'll be alright .Now since i usually browse for school i prefer to use ChromeOS most of the time & when I need a full os i just boot into Linux. I actually love ChromeOS, its very simple & elegant. No nonsense,no distractions installing anti-virus, maintenance etc. If you can install Linux, then I highly recommend this Chromebook for something that isn't expensive but can get any job done", "Date": "September 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Review after 8 months", "Author": "R.

I actually set up a couple printers for her and it works great. The internet is FAST.  I have a $800 Samsung tablet/laptop and the Chromebook is so much faster. I have even asked her if she wants to trade but she won't.  Her internet goes faster than any laptop we have at home. The only thing I had to look up was that there isn't a \"right click\" function on it like Windows.  I went to the help area on Google and got the answer right away.  So easy. I like to edit pictures and make photo books of the kids and trips so I have a program I like a lot and figured there wasn't anyway I could do it on the Chromebook.  I tried it out one day, since my computer is so slow.  I looked in the Google store.  Found one that was free and tried it.  It was very easy to figure out and edited the pictures quickly.  I store my photos on 1 TB portable hard drive and the Chromebook had no problem reading it.  I seem to be the \"go to\" person at home if any of the kids have questions about anything on the computer because my husband doesn't like to deal with computers (still won't set up voice mail on his phone).

Both arrived on time, and in pristine condition.You do not get the free storage if you get a refurbished chromebook.  cloud storage is reasonable to purchase.  you can use the chromebook just fine without the storage, and if you already have a google phone, you can use the same storage account.  There are many free apps.The Samsung has a SD slot, that is very useful.  Both the acer and the chromebook have all the needed port's to plug in accessories, like keyboards, big monitor, or external hard drives.  they do not have disc drives, so you cant use accessories like the Wacom graphics tablet, and pen because you can't add drivers.  you need an app.the chromebook does not require antivirus.  You can easily reset the chrombook back to factory settings.Im hoping I can use the remote feature to help my friend use her new Samsung chromebook.  she is intimidated by computers, so this feature is important to me.the acer has some features that are useable offline, however it is designed to be used while using a high speed internet connection.both machines are super fast.The chromebook would make a nice first computer, or a supplemental computer, but would not replace a personal computer entirely.

Rather, Chromebooks are internet based computers that focus on running apps in Google's cloud through the Chrome web browser.  Therefore, it's a very different device from a laptop or a netbook, where you are downloading applications to use locally -- that isn't the case here.  Although some applications can be used in offline mode, the overwhelming majority of functionality requires that you be connected to the internet -- that's the purpose and design of the device.  So, if you're looking to use Adobe Photoshop, for example, you won't be doing that on this device.  Similarly, if you want the fully-blown local versions of Miscrosoft Office software, you also won't be doing that here (although you *can* create, edit and share MS Office documents through the browser using Microsoft Skydrive (skydrive.live.com), somthing which it seems not very many people are aware of).So, what do you do with it, then?  Well, pretty much everything else you can do with the internet.  Browsing the web, using email, viewing streamed media and music, creating using cloud-based tools like skydrive (mentioned above), Goggle's own Google Drive and so on.  You can also use many, many applications that have been adapted for use in the Google Chrome browser, and are available on the Chrome Web Store (almost all of them are free).A key hurdle for many in using a machine like this is adapting to having almost everything stored in the cloud, and accessed via streaming from the cloud, and not locally.  Your music, pictures, movies, even documents and spreadsheets and so on that you create -- all is stored in the cloud.  While this means that you require internet access to access them, it also means that you don't have to worry about losing things due to hardware failure, or having to manually back up your machine to an external drive -- it's all up in the cloud to begin with.  This is obviously a shift in thinking and practice away from what most people are accustomed to when it comes to laptop computing, and some people likely will have a hard time making that shift.In general I would say that this is a great machine for anyone who (1) already uses a lot of cloud based services and apps, (2) is a moderate to heavy consumer of various Google services and apps already or (3) wants something in the space between where laptops and tablets currently are.  I would say that it isn't a great machine for people who (1) like a lot of locally stored and accessed content and applications and dislike being required to be connected to the net to access these, (2) are not at least moderate users of Google's services and apps and have no interest in becoming so or (3) are satisfied either with tablet computing or with a bigger, more fully functioning laptop.  Many negative reviews that are not hardware-failure related seem to come from the type of product being a poor fit for what the person was looking for, so it pays to understand what the machine is before deciding to buy it.  For someone like me, who has been exclusively using streaming for my music (and movies) for years, who very extensively uses several Google applications daily, and who prefers to have a keyboard, the device is fantastic.  For people who have different use profiles, the device may be less useful.Finally, this specific Chromebook, from the hardware perspective, is quite good.  It's lightweight without feeling terribly cheap.  The keyboard is very well sized and comfortable to use.  The screen is sharp and bright for its size.

So far, she LOVES it.  It's a great little computer.  It's not a typical laptop, so those considering buying it should really understand what they are getting before purchasing it.  Most of the limitations are software based, not hardware based.Things to consider before buying it:1) It's running Chrome OS.  It's not Windows or Mac OS.  Don't get me wrong, it's a great OS, but it has its limitations.2) It's got minimal internal storage.3) It's designed for cloud based functions.So, the person who would want this is someone who wants something light, quick, for web-based browsing and activities but is looking for more than a tablet.Getting past that, it's fantastic overall.PROs:1) It's fast.  It's got a quick processor, 2GB ram, and a Solid State Drive.  All that adds up to it working really fast.  Boots in a matter of seconds, logs in quickly.  In fact, almost every app loads very quick and is quite responsive.2) It's quiet.  Being that it has a SSD, you don't have the typical noise that you hear from a typical hard drive.3) It's lightweight.4) Battery life so far has been fantastic.  With the lack of Optical drive or traditional hard-drive, it uses less power at idle, so the battery life is much longer than typical laptops I've used.5) HD screen is really nice and clear.6) It has a good collection of apps and add-ons that give it additional functionality.7) It has HDMI, VGA out, 3 USB ports.  Has a Webcam & microphone for webchatting.8) Comes with 100GB of Cloud storage (this also comes as a con...which I will discuss in that section).CONs:1) Only 16GB storage...but that's not 16GB that you can use for apps, etc.  It's 16GB total...including the OS.  Even though Chrome is light-weight, it takes some space on it.2) It comes with 100GB of Cloud storage.  This is great, BUT...it's only free for 2 years.  After that, you're paying for it or your stuff is \"stuck\"...and what I mean by that is that while you can access it, you won't be able to modify it (delete, move or add new material).  You can buy more than 100GB for a fee.3) It needs the internet to do almost anything on it.  The apps are run in the cloud, so even simple functions are not functional without internet.  I did not subtract a star for this because anyone buying this should understand the device's limitations before buying it.  Buying a Cloud based device and then slamming it because you need the internet would be like buying a cell phone and being upset that you need to have cellular service to use it.All in all, it's great.  Truthfully, someone could buy this, format the drive and install a version of linux like Ubuntu, Opensuse, or Manjaro and have a great little full-function laptop for cheap, being that many Linux OSes can be installed on about 8 GB of space.For now, my daughter love it and thinks it's great for what she wants, and that makes me happy with my purchase", "Date": "October 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "It Really is a Lifestyle", "Author": "Joseph N.

I can only imagine that Google is a huge company, and that their chromebooks are only a very small portion of their portfolio, and by some estimates, it is not taking off at the rate that they were expecting.  This week, flash support has mostly stopped working.  There are some instances that it does, but the problem is actually get worse over time rather than getting better.  I do love the idea that you can't download software and that you have to deal with most of your programs online.  I hadn't had any issues with this, until the OS starts having issues and glitches about running programs online.  I am sure there is some dispute about paying to update programs that are being used online, but this makes WeVideo, an online video editing software almost unusable, and it has direct sponsorship and support from Google as it is even mentioned on YouTube.  This is a huge red flag in terms of what Google is willing to support with their hardware, when they own the online component that you are supposed to be connecting to.  I realize that this is a relative budget item, but I can't help but feel abandoned by not developing it as an alternative other OS computers, and keeping it as a fun second computer because they are crippling it as a primary computer.  I will update when and if the issue is resolved, but I can tell you right now that just in terms of me trusting the company going forward, it has greatly given me reservations, and has made me delete a star from what was a 5 star review.  I still see the potential here of the design, but the execution and support of their product from Google in the past week or so has driven me to come back on here and amend my review.Original Review:I love my chromebook.  I have to say that this computer is pretty amazing.  I had a Apple Macbook Pro for a while for school, and recently lost it, and had to find a replacement computer within my budget.  I had heard about the Chrome OS and how there was no software that was stored locally on the computer and I have to say that I was curious before the need to get a new computer came up.  When time came to put down my money, I took a risk and I'm very glad that I did.Part of enjoying this computer is knowing and understanding what it is that this computer is.  This is not a netbook.  Yes it is slightly smaller than my old laptop, but a much better build and more comfortable to type than what I have seen of netbooks.  It is very sturdy, and the keys are well placed, with the exception of the arrow keys, which are considerably smaller and placed obnoxiously close to the page up and down keys.  The speakers are also not very good, and placed underneath the laptop which means that sounds often come out a bit muffled.  Not a huge deal for me because I generally work with my headphones in, but something I would want fixed on future models.  The computer works great, but what really is the selling point or reason to not buy is the Chrome OS.A lot of people have commented the tagline of the easy and fast turn on, as there is virtually no boot time.  While this is very true, I think that it is worth mentioning that most basic functions work faster on this computer.  Most computers that I have had in the past have so much software in the local memory that they get bogged down for casual use.  That is why many people opt to have a second computer in the first place.  If you absolutely need those programs for work, then this is a great piece of tech for that, but I would go so far as to say that it can or will in the very near future be able to replace your bigger and more expensive computers.  Most PC's cost are much larger because they have to pay for licenses and such for the Windows OS, and don't even get me started on Apple and the amount that you have to pay for their brand.  I know a lot of people that swear by Apple because of how inclusive their products are and how they read one another, but I have to say that Google is quickly using that model and taking a step into the future.I am a film maker and photographer by trade.  I rely on the power of computer imaging software and have spent a fortune in the past on making sure I had the latest software.  Now I have a machine that has no software allowed.  I read a lot of complaints that Chrome OS doesn't support or run one type of media or another, and while that is true and a bit of a hassle if you are trying to convert all of your old files, what you quickly come to realize is that when you had another brand, you had to pay for patches to run this type of file or another.  By committing to Google, you are very much so simplifying your life and your media content.  Google Docs pretty much covers every type of office document that you could ask for and makes them available to others.  Online editing software exists, and while it is not to the same level as some software, it is getting better, and taking the vast amounts of storage typically required and allowing me to store it on a cloud and allowing much faster computers to work on the actual editing until it is time for me to receive it.  This keeps my computer from getting bogged down or slowing down.  There are a lot of programs that you might have to abandon in the switch, but it is still very manageable with many alternatives to staples.  Skype is replaced by the Google alternative, but not as many people are on that as they are Skype.  The problem with many of these downloads is that they would eat up CPU, and going through Google programs really has kept my computer running great a year after purchase.  Within a couple of years, if given the right support, Chrome OS will be every bit as desirable for every use as the others, and at a fraction of the cost.Couple of questions that I have received since this review has been up.  No, there is no disc drive.  It has a rather thin frame, though I have read in other reviews that it does support an external disc drive, I have had no experience with that because I am not really sure what it is that you would use it for.  It doesn't play movies or CD's, and it doesn't have much of a hard drive, as the only local storage is really only for file storage such as documents to work offline.  I was initially tempted to get an older model with a larger hard drive, but when I saw how little I actually access the hard drive, I am really glad that I went with the solid state drive, because it is utterly silent.  I can't even hear the fan.  No, overheating has not been a problem, and it does get a little warm, that is a few degrees warmer than when turned off, but it has never gotten hot.There are three usb ports, an hdmi port to go to a tv, an internet cable port, headphone jack, a place for a power cord, as well as a mount to hook it to a monitor.  It also comes with a sd card slot in the front.  I really appreciate that Google was able to oversee the build of these machines and make them to their specifications.  The machine itself would probably not be fast at all with another OS, but works perfectly as is.  The next generation was recently announced with greater RAM and processor, but the price has yet to be announced.  It might be worth a look if they are the same price, but if not, this model works nicely.UpdateI have received a couple of questions regarding which model to purchase, comparing this to the Samsung Chromebook.  It is hard for me to directly compare the two, considering that I didn't buy both models, but I would go with the Acer model for a couple of different reasons.  The specs for the two computers' insides are virtually the same.  The other is not faster, no matter what any user on here will tell you.  This model is fifty dollars cheaper based upon Google's price, which I have seen remain pretty consistent across all sellers with only a couple of dollars up or down.  The big advantage to the Acer model is that you can open it up, though you would forgo the warranty in the process, to add ram and the like.  Also, there is an extra USB port on the Acer model, and to be honest, I really don't like the way that all the hook ups are to the back of the computer on the other model.  When I was testing both models in the store, I really couldn't tell the difference in the make of the keyboard.  The only real advantage I would give to the Samsung model is better speakers, but then again, for fifty dollars, you can buy a nice pair of speakers to plug into the Acer model.", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "The right choice for me", "Author": "Meandering", "ReviewID": "R2IA53FKB7VYLW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been struggling to make a decision onto my next device that would be replacing my laptop, it really wasn't about the pricing, more about something that is the most suitable.
