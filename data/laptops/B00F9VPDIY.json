{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Lots of hardware for the money", "Author": "KB", "ReviewID": "R1OC6KXPN5YL2O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The i3 processor with it's hyper-threading technology combined with Windows 8.1 makes this machine really fast. The HD 4000 graphics can stream a HD movie from Netflix to a 55\" TV , at the same time surf the web or run programs with blazing speed. Touchpad can be a little crazy at times but I think it's more to do with Windows 8.1 learning curve than the PC hardware. I can't believe people are paying $100 bucks more for a Acer Aspire with less hardware just because it comes with Windows 7 on it. Windows 8.1 comes with a Desk Top screen that looks and works just like Windows 7, which I use as my main screen and when I hit the start button on the bottom left it takes me to the NEW start screen with the live tiles. Just think of the NEW start screen as the old start button on steroids, everything is in there stretched out over 2 long screen(top/bottom). Windows 8.1 is not that bad and it's much faster. This is a great PC and has the hardware to stay with me into the future. Amazon is the BEST place to shop for computers or anything else for that matter. And when it comes to shipping, NOBODY does it better. I order this Friday afternoon on Prime next day and receive it Saturday before lunch for a extra $13. You can not beat that.Update Charms Bar, if you don't like the Charms Bar go to Control Panel/Mouse/Edge Action and uncheck Right EdgeAction and hit Apply. It still shows from time to time but for the most part it's gone. Thank you Amazon", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice computer for the money!", "Author": "Richard L. Shearn", "ReviewID": "R3VNQ0NLJUFE3O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned an Acer Aspire 7741-7870 for the last four years, and enjoyed it very much until a coffee spill created some issues with the keyboard. Hence I went shopping for another computer. I'm a 67 year old retired guy, and as such I am very frugle as to where and how I spend my money. I do my homework and read all the reviews. I chose Acer four years ago because I considered it the biggest bang for my buck and I wasn't disappointed then and I'm certainly not now.  This new computer was nicer than I expected in looks and performance. The old 7741 had a 17.3\" screen so I definitely wanted another. With this computer I got a better chip set, CPU and bigger hard drive. After hearing so many folks complain about Windows 8, I was a little leary at first. As soon as I received my computer (from Amazon one day earlier than the scheduled date) and got it running, I uploaded the free Windows 8.1 and was off and running. It took me only two days to adjust to windows 8 and I haven't looked back since. As for the complaints about a touchy touch pad, I use a wireless mouse and rarely use the touch pad, so I have it turned off. I also haven't had any issues with pop-ups as one reviewer claimed. The speed is great and It also has better speaker sound than my old 7741. I really like the better keyboard, and the sleek look and design is better than I expected.  It also has USB 3.0, Ethernet, and Bluetooth.  Overall, If you're looking for a basic computer that doesn't have a lot of frills that you don't need, but has more than the money would suggest, and can handle basic duties and movies with ease, then give this one a look. A nice \"Bang for the Buck\" indeed.", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "I LOVE THIS LAPTOP!", "Author": "Deborah", "ReviewID": "RVKXV08UX01Q9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this laptop.
