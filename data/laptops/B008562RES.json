{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent battery life, power and size for the price.", "Author": "Alana", "ReviewID": "R1BLSMDEBPSWAX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "**Initial Ruminations**I only had a few, meagre requirements when purchasing a new laptop/netbook...It must be:1) Compact and lightweight2) Excellent battery life3) Powerful enough for photo/graphic editing, and programming IDE's4) Low costThe line between netbooks and laptops is quite blurred these days. The only real difference between a netbook and a laptop is usually if it has an optical media device (such as a DVD burner/drive). I never use optical media these days so that is not an issue for me.This net/lap/ultra book blurs the line completely; call it what you like. I would consider it to be a laptop since it has 4 gigs of ram (upgradeable to 8). Maybe it is really a lower end ultrabook.Regardless,there are not too many laptops/netbooks that fit my needs as specified above! In order to get a small, powerful laptop you generally have to pay out the wazoo for an ultrabook. Not any more, the Sony Vaio E2-1800 fits the bill perfectly!**Stock Windows Benchmark**I took a snip of the Windows Experience Index:[...]Most bloatware was disabled when I ran this. I am currently trying to unlock the BIOS which could help the processor speed if I can overclock it a bit. I would like to upgrade to 8 gigs of RAM but it will probably be bottle necked by the CPU.I should mention I have the Canadian version of this - it is for all intents and purposes identical but it has a slightly larger battery (for up to 7.5 hours of use) and larger hard drive.**Real-life Usage/Features**I can run jdownloader, browse the web with many tabs open, run photoshop, watch a movie with no lag at all.**Look and Feel**The tactile feel of the keyboard soft and quiet, feels well built overall.Another plus is the \"gesture\" touch pad... I don't need to use the touchpad mouse buttons at all.The white colour is a glossy, sparkly white on the outside. The screen bezel is glossy black. The screen is glossy. The keyboard, touch pad and keys are silvery white with chrome accents. The sides and bottom are black.**Integrated Peripherals**The webcam seems to be a generic quality laptop cam, but with HD resolutions. With the bundled software the picture rez goes to 2560x2048 and has a digital zoom. The video goes to 1280 x 1024.It's got a bunch of software features for the webcam including the \"Gesture Control\": if you use Media Gallery you can wave your hand in the air to change songs, pause adjust volume and what not, kind of like a remote. This works poorly in the dark even when your hand is visible. Seems mostly gimmicky but it's kind of a neat idea. It also comes bundled with lots of (optional) cloud software to organize your media, and the camera has various \"face-tracking\" abilities (Sony calls it an \"Exmor Sensor\" camera) along with plenty of ways to use this (ie. making an avatar move with your facial movements). I don't know if these features are common to most webcams, as I don't know much about them. The actual picture in low-light mode is quite good compared to my past laptops.**Speaker Quality**For a netbook / laptop the sound is what you would expect, no bass, however it goes much louder than other laptops I have had. Quote from Sony \"xLoud technology enhances speaker volume without sacrificing quality.\". I am sure if you left it cranked up it would affect the battery life quite a bit. It's nice to have the option of loud sound though, in case you want to watch a movie or stream music for friends.**Conclusion**This little 'book packs a punch in a small package. It may be even better if I can unlock the BIOS and give it more juice. However, even at stock it is a light weight solution, packs a bit of oomph without sacrificing battery life, so if this is what you are looking for don't hesitate to try it out!", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "A terrific laptop", "Author": "Dustin Farahnak", "ReviewID": "R31PJIXKD61B1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There's a lot to love about this little bugger.First of all, it's light and small.  It's just large enough to be comfortable to type on.I'm a big fan of AMD, a company local to me where several of friends work, but I admit their chips are not at quite at level Intel's are for raw performance.  This is not the most powerful laptop, but it is snappy for web surfing and decodes h.264 basically instantly.  For Netflix, web surfing, document editing, and other every day uses, this laptop is up to the task.For games, I found the framerates surprisingly pretty good for Dead Space, but it struggled with La Noire.  Skyrim on medium settings was playable.Battery life is excellent.  It's been on for five hours now.Keyboards are a matter of personal taste.  I prefer the old Thinkpad keyboards, but this island style is more attractive and has a nice feel.  I can type around 80% as fast on this laptop as I can on my desktop.There isn't too much bloatware installed... Sony is better about this than most, but I removed the Office trial, Kapersky, and Windows \"Essentials\".  It didn't make much difference in performance.The screen is small but gorgeous; the fit and finish is as good as any laptop I've ever had.  I glanced at how to disassemble it and it plainly would be an enormous pain, like most laptops these days.There is no optical drive.  No blu ray, no DVD, no CD.  If you have access to a computer with such a drive, you can easily make isos and mount them for use on this computer, but I download everything these days.  I think a laptop is better without the extra parts.I strongly advise replacing the hard drive in this laptop with an SSD.  The boot times and program loading with this setup are incredibly fast.  This makes a bigger difference to most users than a more powerful processor would.This is an outstanding laptop at a reasonable price.  I paired it with Case Logic QNS-111 11.6-Inch EVA Molded Netbook Sleeve (Black), which fits the laptop well and provides a lot of protection.", "Date": "August 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "I am really satisfied with this purchase, including shipping!", "Author": "Young", "ReviewID": "R2OAJCDG1FR946", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am really satisfied with this purchase.First of all, shipping was very quick are accurate.(MA)Secondly, the design and performance of it are pretty reasonable considering the price at less than $500.Of course, even though the CPU from AMD is less powerful than those of Inter, it is still enough to enjoy it as a second laptop orjust for academic or casual purposes.Lastly, but significantly, its design is very good.

You would definitely need to plug in an additional keyboard.- Keyboard buttons are kind of loud- Computer can get hot quicklyOverall, I'm pretty satisfied. No major objections...just will take time to adjust to a smaller computer. If you can get this computer for under $400, I think it's a great purchase! But don't break the bank on this one.

Vaio Care tells me my PC battery is in excellent condition but whenever I unplug it from the AC adapter charge the battery only last an hour or an hour and a half. This morning, the mouse pad and mouse stopped responding to command. I had to hard shut it down three times which prompted the pc to display this action at start up.

Got it in Seamfoam white and I'm loving it. For the price this VAIO is a good deal the 1.7 GHZ is far from being \"super\" snappy but it does the job, close the lid for a while come back and open it and it resumes quickly, or use the integrated WEB button to power up your computer faster and access the web in about a minute. I guess this does the job for students who want a simple laptop for word processing, surf the web, and use Skype or any other VOIP service. Far form being the best, but not a bad option for the average user.PS: the trackpad can be a little tricky, personally I would have preferred the traditional trackpad with two separate buttons, but don't know why Sony has opted to go with a MAC-like kind of trackpad.

I'm a Computer Scientist turned IT Professional, and I know my way around the computer... BUYER BEWARE IF YOU DO NOT.  Here's why...When I got this computer, I simply took the old HDD out and put a brand new SSD Samsung 830 128gb laptop upgrade kit in.  I improved to 8GB Kingston HyperX 1600MHz SODIMM 204-pin RAM.  I bought a slim external DVD writer.  I used my own install disk to install Windows 7 Ultimate x64 on the brand new SSD.  Finally, I used another computer to download all the drivers available at Sony.com and put them on a DVD.  BUT...FACT:  Sony does not offer USB3.0 drivers for this computer on their website.  When I called and asked them why, I was told they are a standard part of the Windows 7 installation (FALSE!).  I was then told by another representative there are incompatibilities with Windows 7 Ultimate that don't exist in Windows 7 Professional that came with it (FALSE!).  Then I was told I needed to reformat my computer with the installation disks I should have made for it if I wanted any support.  Basically, the only way I could get the drivers were by copying C:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM32\\DRIVERSTORE\\  from the HDD that came with the computer onto DVD and adding the USB3.0 drivers by right-clicking in DEVICE MANAGER on the yellow exclamation points and directing them to scan my copied DRIVERSTORE directory for the drivers.FACT: I have a burnt-out pixel in the top-right of my screen.  Sony claims in-writing, on their website, that their manufacturing process allows for a certain number of burnt-out or \"stuck\" pixels, and it is normal for them.  I have owned (AND SOLD BECAUSE OF IT) 3 Sony PlayStation Portables and 1 Sony VGN-Z590 laptop because they had at least 1 burnt-out or \"stuck\" pixel on the screen.  I am the Coordinator of Technical Services for a large corporation, and have purchased over 10 Sharp LCD TVs, Panasonic TVs, dozens of Dell Laptops, 2 ASUS Laptops, dozens of ViewSonic monitors, and none of them have ever had a burnt pixel.  Sony is notorious for this across all lines of their products, and they even admit in-writing this is acceptable to them.  Just search the web \"Sony Burnt Pixel\" and look for yourself.FACT:  Sony installs a Trojan Horse ISBMgr.exe program.  I wanted to use the VGA port to output to some ancient monitors I was selling...  I thought the SONY HOTKEY UTILITY would simply install the Fn-button functionality so when I press Fn+F7, the monitor would instantly switch from onboard to external VGA.  When I installed the SONY HOTKEY UTILITY, it installed a program called ISBMgr.exe without warning or acknowledgment.  It detected my genuine Sony battery it came with as not-genuine, and instantly placed my computer into HIBERNATION MODE every time my computer turned on, giving a warning message my battery was not genuine.  It did not remove when I uninstalled the SONY HOTKEY UTILITY, and I had to edit the registry with REGEDIT to remove all instances of ISBMgr.exe from loading.  ALSO, the SONY HOTKEY UTILITY does nothing for the laptop except show an icon in your System Tray when you push CAPS LOCK, SCROLL LOCK, or NUM LOCK.  Totally useless, as there are already LED lights on the laptop that show this.  It does not add Fn-button functionality.FACT:  I have read many reports about the black edition of this Netbook maintaining a large gap between the trackpad and keyboard assembly.  I cannot advise anybody to buy anything but the white edition of this laptop as a result.Overall, I don't know if I will send this laptop back, because I may get another with even more burnt-out pixels.  It's not very noticeable, because the resolution is 1366x768 pixels, however I DO NOTICE IT, and it is NOT ACCEPTABLE in the modern market to me.In summation, gave this 4/5 stars because it has Bluetooth, which other Netbooks lack.  I can upgrade both the RAM and HDD without voiding the warranty (unlike the similar ASUS).  But I took off 1-star because to get great results with this Netbook, you REALLY must know what you're doing, it has 1 BURNT PIXEL, and Sony's solution to any problem is \"Format your PC with the recovery media\".Let me know what you think!", "Date": "August 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Light and capable", "Author": "JazzDing \"Jazzy\"", "ReviewID": "R3K2W4GLOWPJBI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I don't really need a laptop much.

I had a Dell Inspiron before this that ended up having to replace the motherboard twice so I really just needed a little PC to get the job done and wasn't looking to spend much.I purchased my laptop directly from the Sony website for $400.Keep in mind- while this computer is in that realm of the crossover netbook/notebook I really wasn't going in to this expecting much from a $400 machine.So I got it. My first issue was Windows 8 - while this isn't an issue with Sony or the computer itself, I found myself longing for Windows 7. I was a little flustered because I watch a lot of Netflix/Hulu and the computer has awful viewing angles. Something to keep in mind if you are really into that. It played videos nicely, however without much buffering.I ended up downloading the free Netflix and Hulu plus app from the Windows marketplace or whatever they're calling it. The marketplace left a lot to be desired and the apps as well left a lot to be desired. I found myself going to a browser to watch Netflix rather than use the app. Again, not really a big deal and not a gripe with the machine itself.Looking at the battery life - I found that if I was ever going to use it outside of my room, the charger needed to come with. Again, I don't do battery intensive activities and was disappointed in the lack of battery life that the machine has. After about 45 minutes - it would get hot and need to be plugged in. I also found that the keyboard was really too small for my liking. I really prefer the island style chiclet keys but as someone that has very small hands - I felt extremely cramped typing on this keyboard making writing essays for college a daunting task. As someone that types 100+ wpm, I would say I could type maybe 60 wpm on this keyboard.The mousepad also was a bit bothersome. It somewhat resembles the MacBook keyboard but after using the computer for about a week, the bottom left side where you would press to left click got jammed and would continue to get jammed often... As someone that left clicks normally, I really don't think is how it should be responding.So for the computer itself and all the above mentioned shortcomings, it has the potential to be a 3, so I will give it 3 stars. The reason I give it 1 is the screen issue.I took my computer on a little road trip and kept it in a sleeve the whole time. Somehow when we got home, I opened the computer to find a cracked screen. This is somewhat ridiculous considering that it was in the sleeve the whole time, was never dropped and sat on top of everything else in the backseat of my car - literally not having any reason to crack. But that's besides the point.So because I had only had the computer about 3 months at this point - I wanted to get the screen replaced. Sony wanted $250, which I was definitely not going to pay considering I only spent $400 on the machine and to replace it myself would be around $70. So for the time being I would use a VGA cable and hook it up my husbands monitor. Something happened and instead of connecting like it should, you had to power cycle it anytime you wanted to see the image on the external monitor. Without a screen, having to power cycle a device using the power button can cause a computer to crash. What I didn't expect was it to crash within 3 days.So now I paid $400 for a computer I used for 3 months and I can't even turn around and sell because my hard drive has personal info on it.Long story short, I bit the bullet and just bought a MacBook and it is well worth the money - will never be going back to PC.", "Date": "September 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "great pc for the prize", "Author": "dp", "ReviewID": "R1J2E7L5V5VEKE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Iam a student and  been looking for a compact pc, potent, light weight, and had a great prize.....it was not an easy task, but I finally was able to come across this Sony Vaio and believe me it is worth every penny expend, I highly recommend buying it.", "Date": "October 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not As Described by Seller", "Author": "Nita", "ReviewID": "R385Q2AJ81H6YW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The specs on the website said it had high resolution screen even an HD graphic card.

I tried many times using the vaio care recovery tools and I didnt get no where. I contacted the online support who entered the netbook thru Remote Access.At first I was impressed Sony CS was instantly in my new Netbook. After a little bit, I noticed the CS was only doing the same exact things I had done and the things I had mentioned during our conversation. WHICH I GUESS THEY DIDNT READ.They said to send it in and it was due to hardware failure. Two problems with this. Its Friday and I need this for a Family Emergency/Vacation. Since this netbook DOES NOT come with a recovery disk, further driving down the stars.So not wanting to quit on this new gear, I pulled out a SSD from another PC and uploaded Windows 7 from a Install disk I had from updating. After I registered my Windows and downloaded all the updates, I started working on the Sony Vaio support software.BEWARE: If you recover this way and use the sony support software from the web you will have problems. Do not install the Sony Applications. They add Agent/Trojans that say this Sony Vaio Battery isnt a Sony Vaio battery. Hot Key Fix download is the culprit.After a while I was still having trouble with the USB 3.0 driver. I contacted Sony Chat and they said for me to hold on while, while they reviewed my previous session. I had explained I switched out the HD drive for an SSD and the USB ports are all working. THERE WAS NO HARDWARE FAILURE.The CS \"Seth\" came back and said the same thing. \"Just send it in,\" he said.I explained that I need this for the family emergency/vacation and sending in a laptop for a driver is unacceptable.During this time he said he would review the previous chat once again to see if he could get anymore info.I asked that he use his REMOTE ACCESS TOOL once again. He declined and said once again. \"SEND IT IN\"For a driver. No thank you.VAIO CARE BRINGS THIS PRODUCT DOWN TO 1 Star. No real support even with a warranty.I would explain to others how I was able to fix it, but I rather Sony lose money from lack of sales.Original: There are alot of pros to this netbook like the other reviewer stated. I only received it this morning and after updating Windows 7, I only score a 3.9 for processor speed. Disappointing as the new Acer Aspire One AO725-0899 has a older AMD CPU that gets a 5.2 on WEI, AMD c_series_dual_core_c_60 Processor 1GHz (1MB Cache).The screen surprisingly looks sharper on the ACER than this Sony???The only reason I went with this netbook was because its for my wife...... ;-)The benefit over the Acer are the 2 Ram slots, bigger Hard Drive, and longer battery power.They both have pretty much the same I/O's. This is a new processor that was released June 05, 2012  so I may be complaining about nothing that a future update may be able to handle.If I could give it 3.5 stars I would. I will rate higher if it gets fixed.Tip: This netbook is set to start with only one Processor.
