For that, it has worked very well.However: it won't print through Google Cloud Print, even though the printer in question works perfectly through Google Cloud Print from other devices.  I spent hours on the phone with Google Ninjas about this, and they finally said they didn't know why it wouldn't work, but I'd just have to print from somewhere else.I've only had the Chromebook for just over 2 months.  In that time, I have been prompted to do 3 restarts for system updates.  Every time, the whole system has crashed and required me to do a full system recovery (reinstall Chrome OS).  I have never downloaded any files to the harddrive.  The machine also seems to occasionally work very slowly and I can hear it chugging away when I am engaged in minimal bandwidth activity like editing a document on Google Drive.I discussed this with the Google Chrome Ninjas and they felt this was clearly a hardware issue, likely a failing SSD drive.  I had a very difficult time using the Samsung online support site, but when I finally was able to contact a representative, they had me send it back (I had to pay for packaging).  They told me if they can't fix the problem, the best they'll do for me is give me a refurbished device even though I have only had the machine for 2 months, it's still under warranty, and I've had nothing but problems from the very beginning.Samsung received my Chromebook a week ago, but they do not have any updates.  They will only give me the number to a 3rd party repair company who tells me that any Chromebook is on hold indefinitely because they need parts from Samsung.  Samsung \"executive\" customer service says they need to put in a query as to if parts have been requested and have no information for me at this time, but call back later.  Total run-around from a company who gave me a defective model to begin with.I am a huge Google fan, and the Chromebook seems to be designed very well; but Google should get out of business with Samsung.  Do not buy THIS Chromebook.  I can't speak to the other models - hopefully they have better hardware and better customer service.", "Date": "October 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just Keeps Getting Better", "Author": "hdtravel", "ReviewID": "RAQVZ7Q56IPVW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Here we have a nice incremental update to the Google Chromebook.

I won't cover that here except to say it's pretty nifty if you know what you want and that happens to be a secure environment for working online in \"the cloud\" (but still like to have the capability of occasional local music, videos, and such for casual viewing).  My main focus in this review is on the hardware and that is because the Samsung Series 5 550 is, currently, about the best of the lot for the price and especially so if you can find a good, used item at a lower price.  At $579, I think it's not a great value, but at around 300-350 it becomes a better deal.The 550 is well made, looks very nice, and has the best performance of any of the ChromeBooks available at the moment (excluding the new Google Pixel model which is still an unknown to me at this point[Update the Google Pixel is at least twice as fast - but also twice the cost. But it is sweet!]).  I have several of the first Acer models which I got for around $200 and I have been very happy with them.  But occasionally, they lack sufficient power (streaming HD videos, for example).  So when I had a chance to pick up one of these used at around $330, I went for it (and glad I did!).The screen is about the same, Acer's are a little better, but the color is good.  Contrast ratio is average (i.e. poor!).  Viewing angles are poor/average as usual, unfortunately, but on a small screen like this, you can get by.  The screen is quite fine for web browsing, email and such, but not so fine for movies (acceptable but not good at all if you're used to better quality displays). The speakers, however, are better than average for a small laptop like this and actually good enough for casual movie watching.  Of course, you can always use external speakers for even better sound. (Update: Speakers have pretty good stereo separation and quality when listening to music.  Not much bass or power, but a nice clean sound. Better than average.)You get the usual 2 USB 2.0 ports, an SD card slot (as others have noted, the card sticks out a bit, not a deal killer, but something to be aware of).  You get Ethernet, DisplayPort, an 3.5 mm audio out (headphones level) and so on.  Nothing special except for the 4 GB RAM which is double what you get on most ChromeBooks and a welcome bonus. Very decent keyboard and touchpad. (Update: Keyboard and touchpad are very nice, much better than average.  Two fingered scrolling is very smooth.)As I use more of these devices, I've come to really appreciate the Google sync up that automatically syncs my setup and info over multiple devices.  And, of course, the instant on/off convenience of the ChromeOS.  Acer's low cost models are still the best value, in my opinion, but if you specifically need the higher performance (many will not), this is your only choice. (And this is definitely a nicer looking rig.)All in all, a very decent unit, and the fastest CPU currently available in a ChromeBook.  (Update: Except for this: Super Google Chromebook Pixel (WIFI) Touch Screen 12.85\" 2560x1700 3:2 LCD i5-3427U 4GB DDR3 32GB SSD 3.4lbs Ultraportable)  I enjoy using it very much.(Update: Super battery life with no drain. Came back after several weeks and still had a full 90% battery which was where it was when I turned it off.  Not a small thing in my opinion.

I ordered myself one as soon as he went back to school with the Chromebook.I was pleased at how after turning it on, selecting our WiFi network and password that we were ready to roll! My kids can log right into their school's account. My 10 year old son has his own school gmail email address and password and can log into my Chromebook with it and work on his schoolwork. All his school administrated settings are saved (giving him a safe web experience at home) and he can access his google docs files, e-mail his teacher, and get his school homework assignments.With google docs and cloud based services like picmonkey, animoto, edmoto, slide rocket, prezi's, google docs, etc...we really can use this computer for almost everything. My kids can have easy access to a computer we can afford! Instead of one expensive Macbook Pro for a family of 5 to share, we can instead have several Chromebooks we can all use for school, work, and fun. No waiting in line for your turn to do homework. I set up bookmark folders in the Chrome web browser tool bar with all the kids \"approved\" websites, and no matter which Chromebook they are on, they can access \"their\" stuff. I am a fan.

The Chromebook is really for people who aren't afraid to let go of native applications and that's a step that I think many people probably aren't ready to take.  However, I really believe that the inability to install native applications is one of the greatest features about the chromebook.  Once you get a netbook and start installing a bunch of applications it's going to slow down fast and you quickly lose all of the convenience of a small, speedy, laptop.  The Chromebook makes sure that you aren't even tempted to make a mistake like that, because if you're getting a netbook it should be to have fast access to the internet, not to run a million programs on a slow processor.Plus with the Remote Desktop App by Google, you can leave your PC at home, and use your Chromebook just like a PC with access to all of its applications.  I've accessed my old PC remotely to upload files to the internet that I need access to, free up memory by removing unused programs, and written substantial amounts of code.I will concede that not having an optical drive is a bit annoying, but between Google Play and Amazon Instant Video it's really not that much of a setback and the other features like instant Google Drive backup make this laptop well worth the purchase.Fast access to the internet with a web-optimized interface, Google did a great job creating a true netbook, rather than a glorified mini-laptop", "Date": "August 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "I just...don't like this", "Author": "AnitaBath", "ReviewID": "R3KI1TYA5XY5HR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I read a lot of reviews before buying this, and I've had it for about 6 or 7 months now and have put off reviewing it. I knew the main thing that I would be using this for would be for internet browsing, so it seemed like a good bet. I knew that I would occasionally be needing to use it for other things, but since the bulk of it was for the internet I thought it would make up for it. Plus, it's so lightweight and fast! How can you beat that?Even though I primarily use it for the internet browser, the 1% of the time that I don't is just a huge, frustrating pain. I could go into excruciating detail, but I feel like if I want to do anything other than browse websites, I have to spend a ton of time finding the necessary work around to be able to do it. I bought this laptop and had to buy a new printer so that I could use Google Cloud print. Obnoxious, but I knew what I was getting myself into in that regard. The printer only shows up about half the time, but that's an entirely different story. If I want to print anything, I can't just print it from the browser. I have to first save it to my computer and then print, so I have to routinely clean out my files and get rid of unnecessary pdfs that I don't need anymore.The thing that spurred me to write my review was that I needed to scan a simple document. Normally you could just plug the printer/scanner into the computer and be done with it, but not now. I had to go into the back, innerworkings of my printer and go through the IP address. From there I could webscan, but it won't let me save the file. Why not? Because it doesn't work with Chrome. There's no workaround for this that I've been able to find. You can't download an IE or Firefox app. While you could argue that it's not Chrome's fault, there are tons of websites that I've found that have problems with Chrome, and you're just kind of screwed when that happens. I'm in school and there's a quiz site that has problems only with Chrome, so the instructor just told us to use a different browser if that were the case, but that doesn't exactly work for me.If this isn't your primary computer and you're ONLY using it as a lightweight, fast internet browser it's good. But even on those rare occasions when you might be needing it for a simple task that you take for granted, it's a huge pain. It took me a while to even find a good, reliable document app, and even then I still routinely have trouble. One time I was writing a paper in the web app and the app decided it needed to update right as I needed to print my paper. It wouldn't let me print without first saving the file, but it wouldn't let me save the file until I updated and then I would lose everything.Maybe I just didn't know what I was getting myself into, but I did look into it before I took the leap from regular laptop to Chromebook. I could just be guilty of not knowing exactly what that entails, but mostly I think that I just didn't expect the few times I needed it to function normally for simple tasks outside of web browsing to be so frustrating.EDIT: Ran into another problem with the word app. You know how some documents you get through email frequently have protection enabled, and it's just a simple fix of saying that you want to edit the document and enable editing? Well, in the word web app, that's not possible. It has to be opened in the actual version of Microsoft word to enable editing....except there's no way to do that on a Chromebook.Also, I've found out I can't use Skype! It's not supported. I have a friend who is having trouble setting up a Google account so we couldn't use Google Hangout, and every other option for video chatting is just through a Facebook app. Except that since Facebook uses Skype for video chats, I haven't found a way to video chat through Facebook either. So Google Hangouts is the only option available for video chats.EDIT 2: I don't mean for this review to sound overly negative or like it's a horrible device. Maybe I'm guilty of not looking into every detail of it before my purchase, but I did look at a lot of the main features of it. My purpose in this review is less to try and prove that this is some horrible product (it's not - I'm just definitely immensely frustrated with it at times), but more to compile all of the bullet points that were easy to miss or brush under the rug when I was researching it in hopes that someone else doesn't encounter some of the surprises that I did.

ChromeOS seems well and good, and I would probably be able to spend my holidays and family reunions doing something other than virus scanning and malware removal in a world filled with ChromeBooks.I also stripped the Chrubuntu down to what's essentially a lightweight Lubuntu installation. The only GUI apps I use are Chrome, Gimp, Inkscape, Audacity, and Skype. Everything else is either in the cloud or in the terminal. The installation process was idiosyncratic, but straightforward enough, with no major problems on my first attempt.I won't dwell on performance. The specs speak for themselves. I have absolutely no complaints. I open dozens of browser tabs and image editing windows without giving a second thought to performance. The battery life is excellent. If you're a gamer or something, it probably falls short. I would be the last to know.But there are several things about this product that aren't easily captured by 'the specs'. I believe they justify the modest premium one pays for this relative to models with similar specifications.* KeyboardThis keyboard is practically a Happy Hacking keyboard adapted to a laptop. The 'shift', 'ctrl', and 'alt' keys are huge. It's much easier to program on this laptop than on my previous laptop. The keys at the top are actually useful for day-to-day browsing, which is nice.* TouchpadThe touchpad is very spacious, spacious enough that I am just as happy with it as with a wireless mouse. I had disciplined myself to using the touchpad on my previous laptop, but always felt a bit cramped. After adjusting the sensitivity and palm detection to my liking, and getting used to the simple gestures and lack of traditional buttons, I'm very happy with it.* Matte screenMy previous laptop's screen was prohibitively glossy. With this one, I don't struggle to see the screen when I'm in a room with windows.* AestheticsI do a lot of my work remotely, at coffee shops and other wi-fi hotspots. With the longer battery life and nearly instant booting, I can sit right down and get to work without worrying about booting it up or plugging it in. I think clients also perceive it as more professional and serious looking than my previous laptop, and that makes a bit of a difference in my line of work.And honestly, it's nice to have a laptop which makes the statement that I selected a computer which is simple and lean, yet well-built.* NegativesThe battery life is solid, but a couple hours short of what's advertised. This may be due to my abusing the computer's resources with programming tasks it wasn't really intended for.

People who want to store their documents, music or video library on the machine, or run any non-web application including Skype, MS Office, LibreOffice, games, etc... will be disappointed. This takes some thought, as while I thought using web-based applications was fine, I had forgotten all about Skype. It's not that Google doesn't have a free web-based alternative, it has one called Google Video Chat. The annoying part is that whoever I chat with has to have me in one of their circles and I have to have them in mine. This wouldn't be bad if as many people were on Google+ as there are on Facebook, but right now I've got quite a few friends who I have to get them to do a lot of stuff starting with getting a gmail account just to be able to video chat with them.Also related to this not being a laptop is that the screen, while bigger than most tablets and my Acer netbook, is still tough on the eyes and I find I need to use the CTRL+'+' netbook trick to enlarge the font often.Of course, for a machine like this, the disadvantages are made up for by and sometimes caused by the advantages. This chromebook is incredibly light and thin. It boots up fast, giving it the tablet type computer \"always-on\" feel. This makes it great as a second computer for when another family member is using the main one. It's easy to check your email without having to wait for the long boot up time if you chose a laptop instead, and unlike a tablet or a phone, you can type back a reply very easily with the keyboard. And since I can not download and run applications, I was pleasantly forced to become acquainted with Google's web-based services. The fact that it doesn't run downloaded executables also means I don't have to worry about viruses.A little nitpick could be the lack of a delete key, I miss it. That would be a small part of the star I took off keeping this from being a 5-star review. The majority of that missing star would be the concept itself.

I received it from Amazon exactly on time. It came in kind of an ugly box, but that means nothing. The speakers are the best I have ever had on a laptop. It's a little getting used to, NOT worrying about charging the battery each hour. This thing can last the day through with lite to medium usage. Another amazing fact is Not Once have I had the desire to connect a mouse. With all my previous laptops, and especially netbooks, I could not function at all without a mouse. This thing is simply fantastic. I look forward to sitting in a Barnes N Noble Cafe and being maybe the only one working on a Chromebook. If I see anyone else using it, then will give him or her a high 5. I already have my large Chrome sticker on the lid, so it's easy to see.Most of all, this is not an Apple or Windows machine at all. Once I'm in the Chrome browser in a few seconds, the online world is whatever I want it to be! No more Apple Logo staring at me squarely as I surf and trying to download annoying updates to every program like iTunes. And no more Windows flags to install updates and restart. No worrying about anti-virus programs. That's huge. I can be online reading email or whatever in about the same time I can pick up my Nexus 7 tablet to do the same thing.I'm typing this whole review on the Chromebook this very moment and the keys are so easy and inviting to keep pressing away. I'm glad that the Function keys were totally removed. To me, that was something back in the 90's on business machines. That top row of keys on the Chromebook were replaced with practical, one-press, buttons. I like how Chromebook looks to look more different by having a search button in place of the Caps key. Although, just press 'Shift-Search' and the all caps button is activated. Hit it again, and it goes away. After all, I don't like ALL my words to be in Caps. I spent a couple days learning the keyboard shortcuts. Hint: 'Control-Alt-Question' mark keys are still a big help.My wife has to use some Windows exclusive desktop apps and she sees no need for this machine.

When I graduated, I bought my first laptop.  It served me well for 4 years, but this year now beginning graduate school, I decided I wanted something new.  My laptop was still functioning but needs to be plugged in (no battery life) and sometimes acts up in ways that make me think it could suddenly drop dead.  I began researching the Chromebook and had a strong feeling that it was the right choice for me and bought one almost impulsively.  I haven't regretted the purchase once.  I am in my first couple weeks of grad school and find the Chromebook to be perfect for a student.  It has a quick start-up time and is fast.  I like the keyboard.  It has a long battery life (6+ hours) so I can unplug and grab it off my desk and head to class without even bringing my cord along.  Now that I've entered the passwords once, the Wifi connects quickly on its own when I open up either in the classroom or at home.  The internet is fast, and I love the simplicity of having everything on my Google drive which I can access anywhere and also feel like my files are secure.  I don't have to remember to save when I'm typing a document - it is constantly auto-saving.  There are still some things I am learning about it that are different than on my laptop/Microsoft software, but it hasn't been a real problem.  I still have my laptop but never feel the need to use it except for watching a DVD now & then - although already I do a lot of my TV watching online with Hulu, Crackle, & Amazon Instant Video -- all of which work well on the Chromebook (at first I had trouble playing Amazon videos but the wrinkles must have gotten ironed out because now it's totally fine.)  I will say that this is not the best choice for photo & video editing - I even found going through my photo files to organize/delete to be a bit of a pain.  But this is not a big deal for me personally - and isn't what Chromebook advertises as it's best feature anyway.  If the main thing you use your computer for is on the Internet, you are willing to use Google Docs for word documents, powerpoints & spreadsheets, and you like the idea of storing your files in \"the cloud\" on Google Drive - you won't have ANY complaints about the Chromebook.

The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it's just a little to pricey.  I wish Samsung would drop the price of the 3g and WiFi only models by $100 - that would be the sweet spot.  As a matter of fact the Chromebook (3G) with all the accessories cost almost as much as our Dell Inspiron R15 notebook that is fully loaded (less high end video).  A Chromebook is not a complete replacement for a Windows or Mac, but it comes pretty close these days.  For me, I simply cannot find a photo DAM that is online that meets my needs, but that's another story.  First, it takes a little getting use to using a Chromebook, but it grows on you quickly.  Press the power button and it is on and you are ready for business.  Second, it's really quiet.  My Windows notebook would at random times spin up the fans to cool the system down which produced a lot of noise and heat.  Third, it doesn't put off much heat, but I still recommend a notebook pad.  Fourth, the battery just keeps on putting out power.  Some other things I like about ChromeOS is it simply works.  No fussing with patches and antivirus.  No having to deal with locking the system down to keep the kids from doing things they shouldn't.  No real software to install.  It is what it is and it just works.

You can't download anything on this device, moreover you can't do much with this device unless you have an internet connection. The Chromebook is designed for optimal surfing for those who don't like tablets, touching screens, and prefer a keyboard to type on than a glass surface.Because everything about this device's software is online, there are no programmes that need to be updated, no patches that need to be downloaded, no upgrades, no nothing. It's straight up internet. Opening it up, it starts automatically, in a moment you see the Chrome logo, then the log-in page (you need a Gmail account and a live internet connection), then once logged in the Chrome browser opens and you're online. Total time from lifting the lid to browsing the web - 7 seconds. Maybe even less.That's basically what sold me on this device. The incredibly fast boot time from cold machine to browsing the net. My Vaio laptop takes around 5/6 minutes to fully load up Windows 7 and the multitude of programs that need to start up with the machine. Then there are updates that need to be downloaded and installed and the machine re-started... it's a hassle. This isn't that bad if I'm going to be using it for a while but if I just want to do a couple of things - check mail/weather/cinema listings/whatever - and then log off, it's annoying. With Chromebook you're on and off in under a minute.But it's no laptop substitute entirely - as you can't download anything, that means no iTunes. Anything downloadable is off the table. The plus side is no virus can download onto your Chromebook either. It's basically virus-proof. Also if I need to use Microsoft Word, Excel or Powerpoint, I use my laptop rather than Google Drive. Drive has versions of those programs which are excellent to use but the format is not as universal as the Microsoft Office package so formatting docs is usually necessary on my laptop.The keyboard is regular size and easy to use and the touchpad is larger than a laptop's and just as sensitive. It streams Youtube HD perfectly with no blips. The desktop is very spare and looks similar to Windows 7. On the bottom left are tabs for Chrome web browser, Gmail, Drive, YouTube, Google search, and Apps. The bottom right shows the time, battery life, internet strength and profile pic. The background can be whatever you like. And that's it. Spare but functional.Battery life is 6 hours though I've yet to test this beyond 3 hours so far. It's really light and half the size of my Vaio. As a concept, it's brilliant. Store everything online and throw out all updates and patches. Log in, start surfing straight away, turn off, pick up whenever. It's so easy. All that other stuff about maintaining a PC are taken out of the equation with Chromebook - you never have to defrag your hard-drive, do a disk cleanup, worry about malware or firewalls, buy anti-virus software, have your browsing interrupted with notices about updates being installed and your system needing to be rebooted. Chromebook looks and operates almost exactly like a laptop without the annoyances a usual laptop/desktop PC has because everything is kept in the Cloud, online. This also means that in concept it remains as fast to boot up in 3 years as it was when you first bought it. With all the extra software and data build-up over the years, my Vaio laptop went from 2/3 mins boot-time to double that in 3 years. With Chromebook, the boot-time should be 7 seconds - forever.Besides downloads, Microsoft Office, and the occasional game, I barely use my Vaio at all. The Chromebook isn't a replacement for a laptop yet it basically has done just that! It's wonderfully easy to use, really fast, light but durable, and is a perfect portal to the internet.

That's me.  I have more devices than I know what to do with.  I got this about a month ago.  I held off reviewing it so that I could see how it fit into my daily life.  Since its arrival it has been my most used gadget.  I choose to use it at home more than I use my macbook airs, or my iPad 2, or my Galaxy Note 10.1.  This is not a gaming computer.  At least not for me.For me it is an internet device.  I love it that I can shut it, and then reopen it later with out there being a lag to get back online.  It does a better job with connecting to wifi than my macbook airs.  Battery life is good.  Having Verizon 3G built in has made it convenient for use away from home.  I have a Sprint MiFi that I can use with any laptop.  That just seems like a total pain though to just opening this thing up and using the built in aircard.  Connecting to Verizon away from home does take a minute sometimes.  Still faster than connecting my aircard.Verizon customer service has been the biggest drag of this thing.  I have spent a total of about 2 hours on the phone with them.  I am confident I have the issues regarding account and billing completed with them, so that is in the past.  I opted for the 3 gb per month plan.  Probably more than I need.With web apps you can do almost anything with this computer.  For me though, I will use this mostly for browsing the internet.  I consider this to be a perfect extra device.In the month that I have had it, I have used it more than all my other devices combined, with the exception of my Galaxy S3.Pros: Awesome keyboard, non-glare screen, battery life, instant on, fast wifi connection, built in 3g, faster chrome than on macbook air, search button.Cons:  No bluetooth.

But, for web browsing the Chromebook is much preferred.Jean mostly web browsed, emailed, etc using a dual-core HP running Windows 7 and mostly Google applications - email, chrome browser, docs, etc. She transitioned to the Chromebook without a hiccup.The Chromebook is light, quiet (no fan noise) and very portable, cool (sets on lap without burning legs), fast, easily maintained with no worries about virsus, maleware, updates, maintenance, slow-downs with age, etc. Just exactly what she needs to be self sufficient (no help from me - ever. She finds that very liberating).The matte screen is sharp, bright and beautiful. It is easily usable outdoors. Videos look great on it.Sound is good and music sounds good on it. The volume could be a little greater but otherwise it sounds very good.The keyboard is very good and is preferred over my Asus.The matte touchpad is large, very responsive and easy to use. Again better than my Asus which is no slouch.The case doesn't show finger prints and is easy to clean. Browsing is top-notch and very fast and smooth. We have found no limitations to our browsing experience compared with our Windows 7 machines. In fact for browsing the Chromebook is better because it starts instantly (we don't turn it off) and there is no waiting around for it to \"wake up\".Hers has no problem with Wifi staying connected. It has been connected for 3 days now with no disconnects.I recommend this for anyone who is sick of the virsus's, maintenance problems, update aggravation of Windows 7, etc and who uses google applications such as Gmail, Chrome browser, etc.  If you like the idea of the Chromebook but don't use Google applications I recommend that you sign up for a Gmail account and try Google for awhile. If you like their applications then you are a canidate for the Chromebook. I actually prefer the Chromebook over a tablet when portability is not the ultimate goal.Update- After 20 days Chromebook developed the dreaded disconnect problem. A work around is to shutdown and cold start. Amazon will replace it but I don't have much hope that will fix it. At this point I don't recommend it at all. I would wait for the 3rd generation since neither Google nor Samsung seems able to fix the problem.Update #2 - Discovered wife's Chromebook disconnects only (when it sleeps) while on battery power. It does not ever disconnect while plugged in or while it is being used. When it disconnects either a cold start or a manual wireless reconnect fixes the problem until it disconnects again. Based on this information the problem is easily worked around in our situation. We just plug it in when not using it. Because of this flaw we dropped the rating by one star.

It's not for graphic designers, it's not for music producers, it's not for hardcore gamers (yet!). The Chromebook was built for people who surf the internet, listen to and watch streaming media, type documents, play casual games; it was built with the typical computer user in mind. Why pay $450 for a low end laptop, full of bloatware and an OS that sucks up half the battery life? Chromebooks remove the bloated and resource hungry OS and programs that people don't use and in return you get speed, efficiency and battery life.

Normally with my other toshiba laptop I can make it through a class maybe a class and a half and the battery is low. It's small too, not too small mind you. There is still plenty of room to type and rest your hands, they skimped on a number key to save space. This isnt really a big deal. They did get rid of the delete key, however backspace works just as well as i'm concerned. The touch pad is very big as well, I'm not used to having soo much space available. At times my hands do bump it and it scrolls about but that's seldom. Having access to google marketplace is nice I can get all sorts of apps that are also on my phone and tablet. The space on the chromebook is limited at 16gigs, however the google drive makes up for it with storage on the cloud. I dump alot on there and pull it out as needed or easily send it to my canon printer via wifi. Makes it very handy.It also has a card reader on the side and since it's so thin and compact I can haul it around with me to photo shoots to back up my data as needed. Just as the commercials state, this computer does seem to stay like new. I've become spoiled by the 3-5 second bootup time. I barely use my desktop anymore unless I need to do something serious photo editing. I also enjoy how it syncs seemlessly to google. Everything from my tablet to phone stay up to date and in sync with each other, I don't have to worry about looking for a file or a picture, it's always there at my fingertips. If you just need a computer for school and to connect to the net then this is the right choice for you. If you are wary about \"the cloud\", no cd drive, or expect a something to keep up with your 7 core desktop then it would be best to look elsewhere.

So much so, that I blinded myself to a lot of the negative feedback on the web regarding lack of regular apps. I figured that 90% of the time I spend on a computer is on the internet, so who cares if occasionally there is some friction regarding desktop applications, right?Well it turns out that there are still some basic issues Google needs to work out with ChromeOS.1) Bluetooth - The chromebook 550 doesn't have native bluetooth hardware, but with a bluetooth dongle the chromebook should be able to pair to all sorts of bluetooth devices.  Unfortunately, at the time of this writing (Dec. 2012), Chrome OS only supports bluetooth for a mouse and wireless keyboard.  No audio for bluetooth speakers, no voice / headset capabilities.  For me, this is a major FAIL as the chromebook was marketed as bluetooth compatible.  Again, I'm aware it doesn't come with the native hardware, but it should work with a bluetooth dongle, and this criticism is equally true for the ARM chromebook as well that does come with the native bluetooth hardware - no audio streaming capabilities.2) Dual Display - As of the time of this writing, the chromebook doesn't support dual monitor setups... Also a major disappointment when I first tried to set this up.3) Although it was clearly advertised - and this is entirely my own fault - not having standard windows apps is more of a pain in the ass than you might imagine.  I can't connect my scanner to the laptop (something I didn't think about at the time of purchase)... Supposedly there is some google cloud printing that will work with might work with my printer, but I can almost guarantee that printing is not as simple as clicking 'print' in the top left corner of the screen as I am accustomed to.  Google Docs, while fine for READING office documents, is not quite as functional at WRITING office documents.The spreadsheet - while ok - is nowhere near as good as Excel.  Once you've learned Office, (and you still use it in the context of work, or because other people send Office docs), it really isn't worth it to relearn all of the shortcuts and tools of the google versions of Office.  This may seem like griping, but are all manners of formulas, filters, etc. in Excel that I use that I would have to relearn in Google Docs... not worth it for the time being.The other area where the standard apps are needed is for general media.  For music, no spotify, no sonos, pandora works (because its web accessible), but no bluetooth to transmit to hardware.  The display port is some strange format that requires special adapter cables to connect to HDMI / DVI /  VGA displays... Not sure why they didn't just make this with a standard display port in the first place, and again as I mentioned - no dual display mode.Many review are correct to point out that this is basically a laptop with the chrome web browser only.  That's basically the experience you get on the chromebook. On a positive note, it does feel like a web browser on steroids though.  You won't notice the under-powered Celeron processor b/c there is no background Windows bloat.  Side by side with a newer i7 laptop, I haven't noticed any actual performance differences surfing the web - and I generally tend to browse with 15+ tabs open at a time.Booting in 10 seconds is great.  I can see why many people claim in reviews that it has become their go-to laptop.  It's addictive to not have to wait to get on the internet, but the novelty wears off once you realize all of the limitations of the chromebook.Side by side with a $600 laptop, it's still very difficult to justify the purchase.For only $150 more, I can get a dual core 3rd gen i5 CPU.  6gb of ram.  500 gb hard drive (I'll give the chromebook the advantage of an SSD, but still the windows laptop has 500gb of local storage that you'd otherwise have to pay extra  for online), BLUETOOTH, dual display capabilities, the ability to use just about any program / application I feel like, AND I can still use the chrome web browser with 15+ tabs open, and store whatever I like in the cloud if I feel inclined to do so.  The only drawback I can think of to the slightly more expensive windows laptop is the boot-time, and maybe the added possibility of getting malware.I plan to return my chromebook in the near future.  All this being said, I would take a look at a chromebook again in a couple of years.  In subsequent OS releases - which are released every 6 weeks or so, and transmitted via internet - they plan to add bluetooth & dual monitor capabilities (though I'm not willing to twiddle my thumbs and wait).  I also think the google app store will fill out a bit with time.After filling in the glaring oversights, google still needs to focus on some kind of windows emulator that can interface with printers / scanners / cameras / mobile phones and other hardware.Also a real competitor to microsoft office is needed.  The Google Docs are not quite there yet, though they are ok for very basic work like taking notes during a web browsing session.  If they can nail hardware and an Office suite, they could really have a platform that people would develop software for.Until all of these gaps fill in though, its just not worth all of the work-arounds necessary to make the chromebook a serviceable laptop.  And it's hard to justify this as a '2nd' computer, when I can get a significantly improved '2nd' computer for only $150 more.Not recommended at this time.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great purchase", "Author": "Isaac Privitera", "ReviewID": "R35KKZSLI1C87S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this primarily as a travel laptop but I find myself using it all the time, more so than my far more expensive macbook.

I use it mostly around the house on my lap while sitting on the sofa or at the kitchen table. I also have an iPad 3 with Zagg keyboard but find this Chromebook, while half a pound heavier, easier to use because of its full size keyboard and ease with which it is used on the lap. I find using the iPad (or other full sized tablets) as a pure tablet is much less comfortable because of having to hold its considerable weight all the time and my Nexus 7 tablet, while a great device, is just too small for general web surfing and document writing purposes. When going out I usually take the Nexus 7 simply because of its much smaller size and weight.I find the screen and touchpad on this Series 5 550 to be nicer than on the newer 11.6 inch Chromebook I played with at the store. I like the less-wide aspect ratio of the screen (more vertical pixels) and larger \"glass\" touchpad and the scrolling speed is a bit better. So even though it is half a pound heavier I am glad I purchased this over the newer smaller Chromebook given the minor premium I ended up paying. (Again I was really impressed with how pristine the \"like new\" condition was.)Having played with Mac Book Airs in the store several times, I would say the screen, keyboard, and touchpad on this Series 5 550 is very much the equal in build quality and usability. I find using the touchpad for scrolling (two fingers) is excellent and actually preferable to sliding a finger on the screen of a tablet. I rarely use the touchpad click buttons preferring the one and two finger taps and tap and hold which work very well.It would have been nice to have a backlit keyboard but not critical for me. While the auto screen brightness works well, I find the extremely wide range of brightness adjustment and dedicated control keys a nice touch. Battery life has been excellent, easily achieving 6 hours with normal usage in well lit environments and over 7 hours with reading in dimly lit ones. The CPU fan hardly ever runs (and is very quiet when it does) and the bottom of the unit barely gets warm (and seems cooler than the fanless smaller 11.6 inch Chromebook felt like in the store).Reading books on this Chromebook using Kindle Cloud Reader Chrome app in two-page mode works really well for me. In general I have found web apps or Chrome apps for all the casual work I need to do. Serious work gets done on a Windows desktop machine.As many reviewers have noted, you really need to understand how you want to use a laptop to be satisfied with using Chrome OS.

I love the concept of having everything in the cloud.  And now that I stopped my insurance job to work full time on our own company, I have no need for an operating system like windows or mac for one of my computers.  I say this because, even though I do 95% of my work in the cloud, there are a few things that work much better on a regular operating system.  That is why I bought this and a mac mini at the same time after both our computers broke.  I can do most of my day-to-day activities on the Chromebook: google docs, online CRM system, emails, youtube, surfing.  Also, it is so light weight and I love how quick it boots.  Even though it may only save you a couple minutes compared to another laptop on boot up, it makes a huge difference between whether you will use it often.  We perform at events and I use this laptop for people to enter their email address for our newsletter.Likes:Quick boot up, great keyboard, seems quick, hopefully will never get laggy (as they claim),sound is good, very portable which makes you tend to be more useful with it.  I was able to get the google cloud print to work even with my older (3 yrs) printer.  Although, I have not found out how to only print part of a document, it only lets me print the whole thing.Issues:Wish the screen was a tad bigger (may 13-14 inches), but I was still willing to sacrifice for the portability and the functionality.Web pages seem to have loading errors more often than when I use Chrome browser on other computers.  I know this happens on all browsers, but it seems that youtube, for instance displays \"not available\" quite often.  This is probably my biggest complaint.You need to be aware of some things the Chromebook can't do.  Of course, most people know that it doesn't allow you to load programs on it.  But, think of this: I was listing an item for sale on craigslist and wanted to load photos.  It does let you click \"upload images\" just like any other comp, but then allows you to search through your google docs to find the image.  You can also use the \"downloads\" folder.  I tried doing this and half of the time, after the image loaded, it did not display.  This made it very ineffective at this task and way better for me to use my mac.  There are so many little things like that to consider.Overall, I like this comp.  My hope is for everything to be completely in the cloud within 5 years, but for now, it is an excellent 2nd computer that can do 95% of the tasks I do, but has the added bonus of being quick, less expensive, and more portable than the alternative notebooks.Printing: If you need to scan documents to computer and do not have one of the newer \"cloud printers,\" you will not be able to get your scans to the cloud.  But, many of the newer printers have a \"scan to cloud\" feature, which eliminates the need to even mess with the computer when you are scanning._______UPDATE 1-29-14:  Now that I have had this laptop for over a year, I wanted to update my review.  Things are still performing well.  Have not noticed a slow down (which was my hope due to almost everything being stored in the cloud).  I love how they keep improving apps that allow you to do almost everything on a Chromebook.  For instance, we do business on the road (touring musicians) and occasionally I get a old-school person who sends me a pdf that needs to be signed.  Since we don't travel with a printer, it was often inconvenient to: find a printer, print out the pdf, sign the paper, scan paper with my phone app back to Google drive, send pdf in email.  Now, when you click a pdf attachment at the bottom of an email, an option appears that says \"open with\"...choose \"PDF Zen viewer and editor.\"  It allows you to type text onto even non-editable pdfs.  And to sign your name, you can use the \"draw\" feature.\"  It is a bit sloppy signing with a mouse, but gets the job done without a printer. (Remember, you cannot connect a printer directly to a Chromebook because it will not load the drivers).  A few issues:  Battery only lasts appx. 2 hours!  This hasn't been a huge issue, since I am usually working from a desk with outlet.  But this could be a major issue for some people.On a related issue (not directly dealing with the laptop hardware...we use this laptop for email newletter signups at events.  Since we don't always have internet, we use the \"Offline\" Google docs and sync it once we have an internet connection.  Big issue: you can edit a basic (similar to Word) Google doc offline, but you cannot \"edit\" a Google spreadsheet offline (you can only \"view\" at this time.  So, if you have no internet and want to collect email addresses/info at an event on a Chromebook, you cannot use an organized \"Google Spreadsheet,\" only regular doc.  This can be remedied by buying a wireless hotspot (use freedompop.com for a free device and free monthly service (only deposit).  This will get you minimal data, but enough to allow people to use signup sheets at events.  Also very handy if you use Square for credit card processing and need a data connection (in a location that doesn't have good wifi, and/or your ipad is wifi only.  Square uses very little data, so you can get away with having this FREE data from freedompop.com.

I open up the box, plug it in, and got to a screen that detected no wireless networks, and which would not let me change either the keyboard or the language.  The only thing that \"worked\" was I could move the pointer arrow around.After an hour and a half with Samsung techs, repeating the story over and over, I was told that I could send my brand new completely defective Chromebook in for repair.  They would not, under any circumstances, simply do an exchange.  Since I'm not excited about working with a repaired machine when I paid for a brand new one, I told them I would rather just return it to Amazon for a refund.Anyway, a good bit of my Saturday has now been chewed up with dealing with an expensive item that was dead on arrival.  In addition I get to wait Monday for the UPS guy to come so that it can be returned to Amazon.  Meanwhile, I'm off to look for other computing options to meet the needs I had hoped to meet by purchasing this product.***UPDATE:  OK, I figured out the problem -- which was remarkably simple.  I didn't understand how the touchpad was supposed to work.  That said, you'd think somebody at Samsung could have talked me through it rather than jump to the conclusion that I should send the machine in for repairs.  Now that I've gotten the machine on and running, I've attached a wireless mouse, which is much easier to use than the touchpad.As for the machine itself.  The smaller-ish keyboard takes some getting used to.  It's not as lightning fast as I'd been led to believe, but it's certainly functional.  We'll see how it goes.  The attraction for me was to have a solid connection to the internet that avoids virus problems.UPDATE2:  I've now had the machine for a few weeks, and I have to say I've gotten terribly fond of it.  It's nice and light, and it turns out that 95% of my laptop activity is online.  So I use it far more than my old laptop, which was getting sluggish, likely due to virus problems.

This Is not so much a review of Google Chrome as it is of the computer it self.This is a light weight, sleek looking computer with a bright clear screen in a really good looking case. The keyboard is very good and overall it is a very operational device.When looking at Windows computers in this price range, it looks amazing.  The question, why can't entry level Windows computers look like this?  Why do you have to spend in excess of $1000.00 to get a computer that is this light weight?SSD drives are dirt cheap these days and you do not need the fastest SSD on the planet, after all I am talking about entry level Windows PC's.  There aren't any exotic metals being used in this device.Congratulations to Samsung on providing a good looking device and Congratulations to Google on producing an operating system that doesn't need an 8 core processor to run fast.Well done.Regarding Chrome, this is not an operating system for power PC or Mac users.  It is, however an excellent operating system for people that browse the web, keep pictures in facebook or other on line sites, need occasionally to open word docs, and use email.  Essentially it is an alternative to a tablet.  I have several tablets in my house, one for my son, one in the kitchen and one in the family room and one that I use on airplanes to watch movies.  The wife doesn't like the touch \"keyboard\" of the tablets, neither does my oldest daughter.  My son loves his Nexus 7, my middle one is very comfortable with either the computer or tablet.  Personally I like the tablet for some things (quick look up of web sites, quick check of email, listening to Pandora etc.) and a more conventional lap top for others (typing email, business communication's, composing documents, etc.).  I can't stand typing on a tablet or phone.  There are, of course, applications that are Windows specific that this PC can not run.  These are very specific.  For word processing there is Google Docs that while not as full featured as MS Word, it covers most of what people use a word processor for and is free.Chrome fits the group of people that wants a lightweight computer platform with a real keyboard that is not tied to M$ or Apple.Wait until stocks are replenished. I see this computer selling for around $1,000.00 on Amazon now.  That is more than twice the retail price.  The smaller brother to this device is back in stock for around $249.00.The price gouging is testament as to how good this device is.

So moving to a Chromebook is a significant change in your mindset about how you do things on your computer. I did a lot of research on my computer before I went ahead and purchased the Samsung Series 5-550 Chromebook, it was not just an impulse buy.The Chromebook does much better if you have a  Internet connection, but with how most of us operate in today's world and the way I use a computer so do a Mac or Windows based machine. However, I can do the basic things that I want to get done offline and the the Web Apps with offline capbaabilities are increasing all the time.I am not a heavy Video Editor (I make a few 5-10 minute YouTube type videos a month), I don't do programming, my use is mostly social media, blogging, writing articles, checking emails, watching a few videos/movies , not the high end stuff that some people do. If I were, I would not recommend the Chromebook for those who need specialty software or have certain higher-end needs.Personally, I was doing 80 to 90% of my stuff online before I purchased the Chromebook 550 and over the course of the month that I have had it have gone to using it 100% of the time and put my MacBookPro in the storage.A couple of things to really think about though.- If you presently have an iPhone - managing it with a Chromebook doesn't work well - you cannot download iTunes (or any other software) to manage your phone - I went out and got an HTC Incredible2  to replace my iPhone 4S and it integrates wonderfully with the Chromebook.- If you need the advanced features of Word/Pages/Excel/Powerpoint/Keynote, while Google Docs does a good job at those things, it is not as advanced as those programs and that needs to be considered. Google Docs/Drive can do most of this sort of work to somewhere around the intermediate user level, but lacks some advanced functionality.- Printing from the Chromebook can be a challenging. Since they do not download printer/scanner drivers, you have to use Google's Cloud Print, which can be a pain in the butt to get working correctly, especially with legacy (older) printers.The Chromebook does what I want and does required a mindset change, even in how I used a computer and how to get it to do what you want - might/will be different from how you do it on a Mac or Windows computer. Chromebooks are not the same thing and you have to approach how you use it differently.The Chromebook 550 does everything that I need a computer to do right now and I love how it works for me and was worth the extra $200 or so that I paid for it over the Acer or Samsung ARM Series 3 Chromebooks, with extra RAM and a few other features, that I preferred over those models.However, in my opinion a Chromebook computer is not for everyone and you need to do your research to see if a Chromebook style computer would be right for you. For me the advantage that the 550 Chromebook has brought to my workflow, far outweighs the disadvantages it has. It just works the way I do.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "very good product", "Author": "vility", "ReviewID": "RJP3U8DXQJVTL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very pleased with the long battery life, the auto updating which allows for an \"always current\" computer, the smooth workingoperation.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "very good product", "Author": "vility", "ReviewID": "RJP3U8DXQJVTL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very pleased with the long battery life, the auto updating which allows for an \"always current\" computer, the smooth workingoperation.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Chromebook with Chrome OS", "Author": "Audio Technician", "ReviewID": "R13XG6QTHLFS3S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "These laptops are quick.

My company has converted over to google docs for business. Most of the employees are creating google documents due to the workgroup features on these types of documents.  So I'd recently become a big enough supporter of google docs to want and give the chromebook a shot.I purchased the 3G Samsung 5 550 and it's a pretty good machine.  The battery life is good (6-7 hours), the laptop is responsive and most of what I need can run out of the chromebook.  I do have a couple of issues/comments if you are thinking about switching to a chromebook.1.  Processor.  The celeron processor doesn't really cut it.  Although it's responsive pulling up web pages and editing google word documents working with google spreadsheets is too slow.  I think they need to roll out a better processor fit for this type system.  At least an I3 in my opinion.2.  Apps:  Although you might think you can live with apps running out of chrome (web based) there were several missing components I wish were included.  These include the ability to connect to CIFS shares locally and app selection.  I was hoping to run local movies stored on my home NAS but no luck so far.  I also think they should run a small repo for some apps if the user wants to have them added such as GIMP, VLC, LibreOffice.  That probably goes against the way this was setup but that type of solution would solve some of the deficiencies of trying to live off chrome apps.  Also netflix is running at low resolution for some reason even though the screen should support 720 HD.3.  Pricing:  Considering that I could get a ultrabook for a similar price with a better processor and drive storage I think the pricing should either be lower or the processor upgraded to an I3.4.  3G:  This is probably just an issue with my service area.  But I've had no luck activating my 3G service with verizon.  Although we have verizon coverage in my service area the activation process has hung every time I've tried the activation process.Overall I'm happy with the chromebook despite my comments.

They mostly use browser-based applications and therefore the Chromebook does not impose any limitations. Our own children are heavy users of the family Chromebook. Their school district adopted Google Docs which makes these devices perfect for them. My husband even uses Spark View (from the Chrome web store) to RDP into his Windows machine at the university which works very well (note: you need to install an RDP redirector on the remote server - hence, RDP use is not trivial to setup even though it works well).The Series 5 Chromebooks were nice but these new Series 550 Chromebooks are a significant upgrade: Netflix and Flash applications now work without any lag or dropped frames whatsoever. Everything just feels snappy. Moreover, the touchpad is much better in the Series 550 Chromebook compared to last year's version.

When pages did load, they would often load in the basic HTML format (single column, no graphics, etc.).  Instead of pictures, just little picture placeholder icons would appear.  I heard about WiFi connection problem with Chromebooks and Chromeboxes (I have both and had problems with both)  but I thought they had been fixed.  I was going crazy searching the Internet for possible causes and solutions.  My DSL speedtest results showed normal speeds, but pages were still loading at speeds that weren't even as fast as one expect from dial-up modems!  I did a factory reset on my Chromebook, but that didn't help.  I was about to do a clean install of the Chrome OS, but I really didn't want to go through that hassle.  So I tried purchasing another router.It turns out that my 7 year old ATT 2Wire HomePortal 1000 modem router was beginning to fail.  I bought and installed a new ATT modem/router two weeks ago and all these connection problems have been solved.  My internet speeds are all back to normal, pages load completely and quickly and I'm very happy now.  I think the problem was that my old router only operated in 802.11b/g, whereas this new router operates in 802.11 b/g/n.  The Chromebook and Chromebox operate or are compatible with 802.11 a/b/g/n.  Or maybe my old modem/router was just dying.Anyway, I hope this review helps other people and saves them from all the frustration I had to go through.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "great product..but do your research before you commit!", "Author": "jay seidel", "ReviewID": "R1FR3GGZ6RFOTF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "chromebook provides a wonderful light and eficient laptop experience. does not run windows but almost everything i do on my laptop was internet based anyway. email, schoolwork, blackboard, facebook. the only issue i had was with voice-over powerpiont presentations...google docs doesn't support those files. all else was very good, with smooth clean interface and operation", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is my new favorite go to device", "Author": "T.

I purchased a DisplayPort to HDMI male to male cable so I could access movies and TV shows from my Chromebook on my new LG TV. (For instance, some Hulu content is only available on the web.) Video worked fine but the only audio was from the Chromebook speakers.  I figured the cable was bad and ordered another one but same thing no change.  I called Samsung tech support, which if you're wondering, took 10 minutes to speak to an agent but said agent was efficient, polite and helpful, eventually being the one to let me know that audio is currently not supported.  The agent told me they were aware of the problem and intended to fix it ASAP.  When I inquired about the definition of ASAP I was told within 2 months.If you like Google Chrome you'll like this computer.  Any other issues seem to be covered under other reviews several of which are very good.  But I didn't see this problem mentioned by anyone else hence my review.  The only other thing I would complain about is the display could be more crisp.  It's fine but could be better. I'll sacrifice some crispness for the speed this machine has.  I very much like everything else about this computer.  I pick it up constantly to \"Google\" something, check mail, or text something with Google Voice.Update 10/03/2012I contacted Google Chrome Support after comments from two other users saying they were having no such issues.  Google suggested the problem with sound was a hardware problem and to contact Samsung.  I ended up requesting a replacement from Amazon.  When it arrived, still no sound.  I returned that unit and contacted Samsung again and they indeed confirmed that the DisplayPort supports video only.  If you want sound, you need to connect a sound cable from the headphone jack to external speakers.  Fortunately for me, my home theater receiver has a headphone jack.

After connecting though, I would go to a webpage, and one minute it would work, the next it wouldn't.  It seemed to keep dropping the connection - odd since my other laptops weren't doing that; but ok - so I wired it right in with a cable... same deal.I went through the manual that came with my laptop, I couldn't find any support numbers whatsoever.  Very lame.  I just kept messing with it, and eventually it seemed to drop the connection less.  However, there was always a big delay in loading web pages - this is the ONE thing this computer should be great at right?  I put it beside my very old laptop (on the same internet connection) it was loading pages twice as fast.I'm not sure if there is a design flaw, or I just got a bad one, but since I couldn't find a support number, I guess I won't know - I'm sending it back.Very disappointed.

The experience was OK, but did have flaws. Late spring, Google changed the game and updated Chrome OS to be a welcome competitor in the OS world. I have since upgraded to this new Samsung. Major differences are a slightly trendier appearance and much better audio. Flash video plays back flawlessly. In the last three months I have converted our small business all to Chromebooks and Chromeboxs. We even use RDP for our Quickbooks and love the experience even more using a web RDP connector. There is almost nothing we can't do that a normal computer does. My co-workers embraced the challenges the first day or two in no longer being on Windows, but we have since overcome all of them (we were already a strong Google Apps company).One note I would like to add (and is confirmed in other reviews here) is the two lovers of this machine. Techies love it for the simplicity it is. I find it better to pickup for web use then my tablets (We have Ipad, Nexus 7, and 2 Kindle Fires in my family). I no longer need anything stronger then this. It is my number one device with my tablet becoming the secondary one.The surprising plus of this unit is how easy it is for less technical people (like my parents). This is actually the PERFECT computer (or a chromebox if you prefer a desktop feel) for anyone embarrassed to keep asking a family member or friend for help with your virus loaded or problematic computer. You will honestly not have an issue with this and take control of your own technology.PROS-ITS EASY!!!-Will last longer on battery then traditional laptop (but wish it lasted as long as the first gen Samsung)-Everything you do is either on the web or will be there in the next year anyway. This simplifies all the web things you do into a much easier format then any browser can do alone on a Mac or Windows PC.CONS-Good internet needed (yes there is offline support, but still).-You will either need new compatible printer or plan on using an old computer as the \"bridge\" between your chromebook and your printer (will need to just stay on in the corner of the room).In Summary:This is a technical game changer.

Also, you're going to have the highest quality web-browsing experience with it, it really does load web-pages faster and you can stream quicker (compared to my macbook pro and dell inspiron).You're pretty much limited to stuff that be done in a web browser. 90 percent of the stuff u do might be through a browser but what about the other 10 percent? It gets annoying switching to a computer just to use skype or some other software that isn't an app or can't be used thru google docs (obviously it's not meant for real gaming). Not being able to use skype is only real problem. - Not having to deal with software updates is a benefit for me, I could never stand it when my windows computer would randomly shut down for an update, although, I never thought of having to install anti-virus software as much of a hassle (I just use the free version of AVG). - Some of the short keys will take some getting used too, its very different from the keyboard that you're probably used to (there's no caps lock button on the keyboard plus some other buttons, you've got to use a combination of 2 different buttons to put the keyboard into caps), plus it doesn't use the conventional start menu system and I h.It's very good at picking up wifi, it can make connections that higher-end laptops can't do and it can attain a much higher download speed then other computers using the same connection (i've tested this against my mac plus the HP envy).You can copy/paste music right off of an Ipod (also off of other devices that normally need software installed first)!! the files names will be random digits/letters but when you transfer it to a different ipod it will read it as the real names.Update 5/24/13: all of the problems/cons below have been fixed - it no longer randomly crashes ever and it lets you know current power levels pretty accuratelyMore Cons: - randomly freezes and browser crashes (usually happens when I go days without powering it off) - it's really hard to know when the battery is going to die (it doesn't last for 9 hours - maybe if you're on the lowest brightness level) but every laptop seems to have this problem.That's it.", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "The honest -  good and bad", "Author": "Press", "ReviewID": "R1CV09ISYV8CQO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Here it is.

Finally, I had time to download another operating system for it on my girlfriend's computer and try to reboot my chromebook. It kept telling me that I was in developer mode and it wasn't verifying the operating system, but it wouldn't tell me how to get out of developer mode. I called Samsung's help and they were NO help. I did everything they told me to do and it still doesn't work. I've \"recovered\" my system (and lost all my papers and personal information on the device) multiple times now and it still won't work.
