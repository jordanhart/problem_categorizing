{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The most beautiful laptop you can buy; a few shortcomings", "Author": "CAF", "ReviewID": "R3PJ7AYBL94DJ8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, this thing is gorgeous.  It truly makes the prototype computer in the category, the MacAir, look frumpy. The feel of the laptop is first rate too; the computer feels very solid and perfect to the touch. Asus did a great job packaging the UX31: it's really nicely boxed with an attractive and functional sleeve, as well as a matching pouch for accessories.  I don't plan on using mine as a presentation laptop, but a direct mini HDMI and VGA port adapter are included.  Two USB ports, one of them USB 3.0, are available.  I think a USB 3.0 port is far more useful at this point than a Thunderbolt connector except in a very few cases (1. You have a Thunderbolt jack on your monitor,  2. You have one of the rare and very overpriced Thunderbolt connectivity external hard drives).The screen is sensational.  If your UX31 is closed, people can't help but notice the sleek design. If it's open, they'll be wowed by the screen.  The 1600 x 900 resolution is class leading, and the brightness is as well.  It's one of the few laptops you can use outside if you want.  Some have complained about the off angle viewing being sub-par.  In normal usage this is not an issue. How often do you use your laptop while looking at the screen from 45 degrees off to the side?  If you are buying a laptop to watch movies with a group of friends, this is probably the wrong computer for you.  But then, any laptop is probably the wrong computer for you.Like all computers with a solid state drive, boot up is amazingly fast.  Also like all thin SSD laptops, storage space is limited compared to a traditional hard drive.  This should be taken into consideration if this is intended as your sole computer.  I bought the 128 GB model, and will use my desktop as the primary storage site for data, photos, videos long term.  I think the UX31 will have enough space for my mobile needs, especially since I'm storing most of my music in the cloud with Google Music these days.Battery life, even with the screen brightness cranked up, is quite good. Charging is also fast with the well designed AC adapter. Unfortunately, in keeping with Asus tradition, the charging pin is small and feels inadequate compared to the rest of the device. The charging light on the plug that attaches to the computer will occasionally blink back and forth between red and green with the slightest of touches, indicating a so-so connection. It gets the job done, but should be better.The touchpad on my unit was initially overly touchy and somewhat erratic, as others have reported.  Asus responded promptly with an update, however, and that has resulted in good functionality for me.  I think most people would not think anything of it, pro or con, compared to other laptops.The facial recognition hardly worked at all when I first got my computer, but Asus has also promptly updated the drivers for that.  Since the update, it works most of the time.  It's a little gimmicky, but I've been having fun with logging on using facial recognition mode instead of a password (you can always use a password instead, of course).I think the biggest potential drawback to the UX31 is the keyboard. It is low profile, as necessitated by the overall design, and the keys can take some adjusting to.  I have found it fine for my purposes, but it could be better. If I was using my laptop primarily for intensive keyboard sessions like typing a PhD dissertation, or the like, I don't think I would recommend this laptop. For most general users, though, I think adaptation to the keyboard will occur fairly quickly. If you're not sure, you should try a test run, but keep in mind that it may take a day or two to totally get used to it.  I find that's true with most mobile keyboards I use.Overall, I love this laptop. The outstanding design and build, stellar screen, and excellent performance greatly outweigh it's shortcomings.  Especially for someone who wants to primarily run Win7, this is THE thin laptop to get right now.  Even Mac users will be seriously reconsidering their commitment to OS X; we have three Macbooks and an HP laptop in the family. My wife uses a Macbook, and has been jealously eyeing my UX31 since it's arrival. I am kind of glad they're in short supply right now--I really like having the coolest laptop in the house.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Zenbook beautiful but poor quality control", "Author": "NYC outlaw", "ReviewID": "R3FNX3WCBPJK0U", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been waiting forever for Windows laptops to finally catch up with the form factor/design of the Macbook Air. This time Intel and its partners deliver!I've owned a Macbook Air for the last 2 years and I definitely prefer this laptop to that Macbook Air (to be fair I don't have the current generation Macbook Air).The Asus Zenbook which looks like a macbook air Clone online does not look like a clone of the mac air except for the form factor.  The brushed metal look is definitely classier in person than it looks online. As far as performance goes -- so far it's been great. The instant on actually works (finally Microsoft!), the audio BLOWS away the audio on macs and is wonderful. The laptop does not seem to heat up while on my lap or on the sofa -- but I've only had it for 2 days.My only criticism of the laptop is the keyboard and mouse. The keyboard is not backlit and is definitely not as nice to type on as the Macbook air. The trackpad was initially somewhat unresponsive, but when I called asus they suggested that i download new drivers from the asus website and voila the trackpad is working great now.EDIT: GT's review is accurate in that Asus shipped these with different components some better than others. I was lucky enough to get the ADATA SSD but had the Syntellic trackpad.I had to ship my laptop to asus a few times regarding trackpad, and eventually I simply asked them to replace the trackpad with the elantech pad and everything has been better since. The customer support was pretty good and the repair time was great. BUt it really should've have been shipped to me in the condition it is in now. 1 year later -- this is a better product today than it was when I bought it.", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Poor Keyboard and Touchpad downfall of Zenbook", "Author": "H. Izadi", "ReviewID": "R35GFFK5YKK29L", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Review title says it all. The poor keyboard and touchpad killed what would have otherwise been a lovely machine. As it is though, I simply can not do any work on this machine.Keyboard: I am a heavy typer and even after almost 2 hours of typing (i.e. trying to get used to the keyboard) I was still consistently missing keys here and there. By missing, I don't mean I wasn't pressing the key. I would press the key and nothing would register. The number of errors in typing I would make compared to normal increased significantly.Touchpad: I updated the BIOS and drivers for the touchpad (as well as a host of other updates including one for the wireless). The touchpad model I had was the Sentelic (there are 2, the sentelic and elantech), and the driver update I used was the most recent version 9.1.7.7, which on their download website is dated Oct 15, 2011.The driver update did help somewhat, turning what was a horrendously unusable trackpad to a subpar jittery trackpad. And in order to get the to that point, I had to turn off 'gestures' in the trackpad control panel--which means no trackpad scrolling. With all these adjustments, the trackpad still would occasionally jump from place to place, making mundane tasks nerve-racking.Franky, I simply could not do any productive work on the Zenbook. I really wanted to like this machine, but what is the point if you are constantly missing keystrokes and can't even highlight a piece of text without worrying that your cursor is going to end up on the opposite side of the screen.My overall rating was poor for the above reasons. Even though it is a nicely styled, fast machine with high res display, the cons far outweighed the pros for me.The 'Zenbook' did not give me peace of mind.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Truly Great Ultrabook", "Author": "Mark Lorenz \"kewl!o\"", "ReviewID": "R2NV53EOK2T1YO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ultrabooks are the new Intel-configured \"standard\" to compete with the Apple MacBook Air.  I had been watching this space for a few months, anxious to replace my elderly XP Windows mini-tower.  I finally bit when I saw all that Asus is offering for $1,099. I had a number of must-haves and like-to-haves.Must:Minimum of 1600x900 screen resolution.  Asus is the only one I know of at this time that offers > 1366x768.  And the screen is 450 nits (meaning it is very clear and easy to read).Solid state drive with at least 128GB.i5 or better processorFast wakeup from sleep.  The UX31 is amazingly fast.  Wakes up about as fast as my iPad!  Unbelievable.> 6 hours of battery life.  This will definitely vary based on what you're doing (e.g. watching a movie will drain the battery in < 4 hours). I am a professional software developer, so I do some heavy-duty processing at times and I usually get around 5.5 hours before the UX31 warns me that I've reached 10%.Bluetooth.  I'd recommend a BT mouse in addition to the trackpad. The pad isn't bad, but if you're doing a lot of typing you will occasionally move the cursor unintentionally.< $1200.  Intel said that Ultrabooks should be < $1000, but the only ones that are so far are poor in some quality and performance areas (I won't name names, but don't confuse Asus and Acer).4GB+ of memory.Like to have:Nice looking.  The UX31 is very beautiful inside and out - even the bottom! Yet is very solidly built.Quiet.  This system is very quiet and doesn't get hot.  The venting is in front of the speaker behind the keyboard and out the bottom.Lightweight.  The UX31 is < 3 lbs.What's not so good?  All systems have drawbacks - here's my list for the UX31:- The keyboard isn't as good as I'd like.  It's not bad, but you definitely have to type more deliberately than a \"regular\" keyboard.- The battery isn't user-changeable.  You have to send it to Asus to service.Bottom line: I did all the research across all the companies (you should see my spreadsheet :P ) and the UX31 is the hands-down winner for this category of system.---As a side note, if you really want more than this, my larger laptop choice is the Dell XPS 15z. It is really a MacBook Pro competitor and costs a lot more than the UX31.I'd recommend the Plugable USB docking station and the Build laptop and accessories cases to go along with the UX31.  All purchasable on Amazon of course!And by the way, the UX31 is in short supply.  Don't give up - just keep looking.

Even though the laptop is very thin I barely notice since its materials give it a  sturdy feel.- The keyboard is solid. Before ordering this laptop I was a bit worried since I had read that the keys were pretty  shallow and didn't have a lot of travel. Granted, this is less of an issue for me since I tend to type heavily,  so this may be more of an issue if you type lightly.- The screen is beautiful and the large resolution really make a world of difference. The large resolution makes it  a lot easier for me to get work done. There can be a bit of a shallow viewing angle and if I'm showing someone  something on my screen I'll often have to adjust the angle. It's not too much work.- The speed. I opted for the i5 instead of the i7 and I'm plenty happy with the speed. The SSD is quick and the  laptop really does seem to boot almost instantly. I'm a software engineer and I often use this machine for work.  It has no trouble running visual studio, hosting a sql server, and playing whatever media I want to listen to  while getting work done. This is great for doing work on the go.- The speakers are a really nice unexpected bonus. I can't imagine needing a louder laptop than this one is capable  of going. Since I'm on the go quite a bit I generally find myself using headphones anyway.- Nice included accessories are also a bonus. The sleeve that come with this is nice enough for me not to shop  around for a new one. It has a magnetic flap that keeps everything secure.- Battery life is great. 7 hours is generous if you're actually doing stuff, but close to 6 with moderate  brightness/usage is no problem.The bad:- As I'm sure many have mentioned the trackpad can be a bit quirky. The multi-touch gestures work well, but I don't  find myself using them much. I find that I accidentally right click quite a bit, and when browsing the web it's  easily to accidentally zoom in and out by doing the multi-touch gesture.- The only other issue I can't fault Asus for since I obviously read the specs before buying it, but it'd be nice  to have another USB slot. If I'm using a USB mouse, and wired internet (which requires an included USB adapter),  I can't pop in a flash drive without unplugging the mouse. I'm not complaining as this is easily fixable by a hub  or bluetooth mouse, but it is something to keep in mind.All in all I am very happy with this purchase. The SSD is makes a world of difference. If you're really picky about touchy trackpads, I'd recommend trying one of these out in a store before buying it. I am not sure about how much more battery life the i7 eats up, or what use cases would require you to need the small amount of extra power, but unless you're someone that wants the best/fastest around just because, I can't see a reason not to go with this in favor of the more expensive model.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "I so much wanted this to work", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R33SVOHFU2TX8X", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I just got my zenbook today, and I'm typing this review with it.  I so badly wanted this to work--I love the form factor, I love the battery life, and I love the speed.  Here is why I couldn't give it more than two stars.1)  I am a fast typist, that has used many different types of keyboards--bluetooth, laptop, notebook, netbook.  This is the only keyboard I have ever had a complaint about  It's not just about hitting the keys hard.  You have to hit them in the middle of the key or it *may not* register.  I'm not really a super picky person, but this keyboard really doesn't cut it.  what a shame.  One of the most important aspects of a computer is the keyboard input.  And I've never really had a complaint about any other keyboard I've used.2)  The sound was unbalanced, much louder on the left.  I checked the windows balance settings, and they are even.  I used different types of media and checked all software settings, I even called asus tech support.  They said return it to Amazon because an rma will take 15 days.3)  The trackpad generally worked well, but sometimes it would freeze, and not work.  I tried updating drivers, but nothing seemed to help.  It is terrible to be browsing the web, and have the trackpad freeze for 1-2 seconds.I did not install any additional software, I just started using the computer out of the box, and experienced the above problems.  For over $1k, I expect a much better quality-controlled product.  i'm really disappointed because this is exactly the kind of computer I need, but unfortunately the zenbook won't work for me.

I looked at a number of different models and was honestly a little apprehensive about purchasing the Zenbook given its comparatively high price and the many negative reviews.I can honestly say that I am 100% pleased with the Zenbook after having used it for three weeks now. I don't know whether the other reviewers on here are simply too picky, but I have very few complaints about this extraordinary machine. (Plus, it's design and aesthetic is spectacular - it looks even better in person than in the pictures.)To begin I'll address what seem to be the common complaints:1) The touchpad: The only problem I've encountered with it is the fact that if you're typing and haven't used the touchpad in a few minutes, it takes a split-second to respond when you go to use it again. Sure, it might be slightly annoying, but it's hardly a dealbreaker. This \"problem\" is so inconsequential that I haven't even bothered to update the driver like many have advised.2) The keyboard: I do an ENORMOUS amount of typing for work and am extremely picky when it comes to keyboards. After reading all the poor reviews about the Zenbook's keyboard I fully resigned myself to the fact that I might have to return this computer if the keyboard sucked. However, it doesn't. I've found the keyboard not just to be 100% functional, but actually quite spectacular. I thoroughly enjoy typing on it any don't seem to have any of the problems with missed keystrokes that previous reviewers have mentioned.3) Wireless connection: Some have complained about dropped connections, a problem that I have not encountered even once in three weeks of daily use.4) Battery life: I seem to average about 7 hours per charge with general web surfing and word processing. That only drops to about 6.5 hours when I do more CPU intense image processing and such. So I'm completely satisfied with the battery performance.I'm not a person who is easily impressed by the newest technology. Especially after reading all the negative reviews, I was quite leery about purchasing the Zenbook. Despite my initial critical view and suspicion, I have to admit that it has not just lived up to my high expectations, but likely surpassed them. I understand that many of the issues with the keyboard/touchpad likely boil down to personal preference - not everyone will like the Zenbook, but I am thoroughly satisfied with it.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Everything great....but Keyboard", "Author": "ktchi", "ReviewID": "R1MKFGHADFP5IQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've had the asus ux31 for a few days now and I've decide to return it.

So the wifi would hiccup and lose connection every couple minutes...which can be really aggravating. But, after installing the new driver update I have not had a single issue since. I tested this by leaving pandora on for a couple hours, and it did not stutter or hiccup but rather was working just fine.By contrast, and much to my surprise, the trackpad worked with gestures like zoom and two-finger scrolling just fine. It is actually really nice and large. You can adjust various things to suit your liking and I see no issue with it.The keyboard was something I was certainly worried about before purchasing the laptop. I followed reviews about all the ultrabooks religiously and after numerous complaints about it, I was iffy about the laptop as a whole. Yes, I will admit the keys are a bit shallow, but no problem with missed keystrokes. Before this laptop I owned an asus eee pc and I certainly had to adjust to that laptop. This one is no difference.The power button is where the delete button usually is and this is going to take getting used to. But, like the mac trackpad two-finger scrolling in the opposite direction...its just a new layout to adjust to. Lastly, the viewing angles are only so-so, but, the screen has beautiful resolution that makes up for it.Overall, if you are on the fence about this laptop get it. It is light, gorgeous, robust, and seriously fast. Boot times are top-notch; the cpu is fast; the gpu is not bad for games either (played skyrim for about 19 hours with no problems or complaints!).

It's a beautiful piece of hardware.  Much has been made of the distinction between the two flavors of SSD.  I have a slightly different perspective on it.  I'm coming from years of using notebooks with rotating media.  I have spent way too much of my life waiting for Microsoft Windows to take agonizing minutes -- trillions of operations at today's clock speeds -- just to boot up.  I pulled a Sandisk SSD on my Zenbook, and my machine cold boots in maybe 15 seconds or so.  Even better, the notebook can sleep for well over a week.  So the normal use case for this machine is to just put it to sleep, e.g. by closing the lid.  When I open it up, bam!  The unlock prompt is waiting.  So for me, even with the \"slow\" SSD, living with this notebook is fundamentally different and light years better than a traditional notebook!Nothing is ever quite perfect, though, so here are a few observations:  The keyboard seems very high quality.  However, it does require noticeably more force than most keyboards to actuate, and I find I get missed keystrokes, and sometimes I slip off the intended key while pushing on the smooth metal.  I pulled the Elantech touchpad with my Zenbook.  It is a little finicky, but in general it's just fine.  It is extremely sensitive, so that sometimes I wind up clicking on things when my intent was merely to scroll or move the pointer.  The only real 'bug' I've noticed is that, sometimes when I try to two-finger scroll, it keeps popping back to the beginning/top of the page.  I think the biggest, albeit minor complaint for me is the screen.  It's hard to say exactly, but while my screen appears razor-sharp, its color seems to be a little \"washed out\".  The cartoon colors in graphics all look fine, but I've noticed in photographs that the colors seem less distinct and vivid than on other computers I have.

Of course my Asus is considerably cheaper than the Air - $1,000 for the Asus, about $1,500 for the Air when I bought it.The Zenbook's keyboard takes some getting used to. Some have complained about the keyboard, but it wasn't a difficult adjustment for me.The touchpad so far isn't even the same league with the Air's. But I've only been using the Asus for a couple of days, so maybe I need to learn more about it and add my personal tweaks. I use a mouse mostly, so the touchpad is not a big issue.I find it harder to read on the Asus screen than on the Air. Maybe it has something to do with screen resolution. But I should be able to make the adjustment. I just need to remember to Windex my eyeballs every morning.The front corners of the Zenbook feel sharp. I guess this would be a plausible explanation for slashed wrists at a hospital emergency room.Glad it has at least one USB3 port (there's a second USB2 port), a Micro-HDMI port (which the Air lacks).Oh, the sound system. It's fantastic. I hate laptops with feeble audio. The Zenbook's audio (Bang & Olufsen) is actually loud enough to be practical.For those who insist on a Windows operating system, the Asus UX31E might be an ideal, extremely thin, light and practical laptop.", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "A good laptop; but not perfect", "Author": "Jason Tien", "ReviewID": "R3HQEDWSYAX511", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just got my laptop yesterday, so these are just some initial thoughts.The good things:First, it's biggest draw is the fact that it's light and that it performs. It's much lighter than I thought (feels lighter than a macbook air, although I know they're supposed to be the same weight). And it's much faster than I thought. I bought the slower CPU because I didn't think it was worth an extra $400 for an extra 100MHz of clock speed; and I was right. This processor actually is faster than some of my desktop computers that have chips benchmarked to go much faster than the i5 2557M. It even handles processor intensive programs like Photoshop reasonably well -- good enough to work on the road if need be. And even though I think I got the \"slower\" SSD, it doesn't seem to noticeably impact performance.Second, the screen is beautiful. I wondered whether to get the smaller UX21 screen with less resolution, but the resolution on the UX31 is breathtaking.Third, I have no problem with the keyboard. It does drop keys once in a while, but you feel it when it drops keys. And I have no problem with the touchpad. I think the multitouch might be patent infringement, but we'll let the courts decide that.Fourth, I like the idea of their accidental damage warranty. I haven't damaged the laptop yet, so I don't know if they'll honor it, but on paper it sounds great.With that said, it is missing a few features that would make it more convenient:First, you can't lock the laptop with a laptop chain. Given -- I rarely bother do to that. But I'd like the option to. I mean, how hard is it to cut a small hole in the chassis for the laptop lock?Second, the keyboard is missing keys. I don't mind the low profile of the keys or the fact that it's backlit (i touchtype, so I can find the keys as long as I feel the 'F' and 'J'), but it's missing the 'home' and 'end' keys. Which I use often. And the delete key is next to the power button; I'm constant afraid I'm going to accidently turn off the computer.Lastly, the laptop lid (where the monitor is) needs a bit less give. If I bounce the laptop on my knees while the screen is open, the lid falls backwards. It doesn't fall very far because it can only open to a 120 degree angle or so. But there should be more friction holding the screen in place.Other than that, I'm pleased.", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "looks great, but in the end it fails", "Author": "Jesse D Schoch", "ReviewID": "R2T9CANTMLI3NH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is a thing of beauty, but laptops need a few key things to really work well and these things depend on how you use it.  I touch type, and I need a keyboard that does not miss keystrokes.  there is nothing more frustrating in the world than to have to shift focus to making sure you are doing something differently, especially like typing.  I've almost never met a keyboard I didn't like, but this one has my fingers in spasms and convulsions.  the thing is it sounds like you are typing but the keystroke can make a noise, but not register.  this is especially apparent on the larger keys like the enter button, but it seemed to happen randomly throughout the keyboard on various words.  writing any code, especially javascript with all it's {}[]()'s was a nightmare.  I think if you touch type you should really go look at one in the store and pull up a flash typing game to test how accurate your typing was.  I gave it a day or two and really wanted to love it, because the screen is great with a nice pixel density.The trackpad, while not great isn't that bad.  I got the elan one, and the sandisk ssd.  I didn't notice any slowness on the ssd.I had a few other nitpicks like the lack of 5Ghz in wifi, the placement of the delete key right next to the power button, and the lack of backlight.The only other issue I had was with the thinness of the front, it just seemed to be pushed away with my wrists while in bed.  The corners are also a bit sharp and uncomfortable.I ended up returning the ux31 and getting 25% off a series 9 at the microsoft store, and I bought it for the keyboard but the device is very nice in every other way, it also has a matte screen, it's lighter, and it has a backlight for the keyboard.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Terrible Support from ASUS", "Author": "TommyT", "ReviewID": "R2F7ZB5RVP3CJZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After completing the setup on my brand new zenbook, I noticed the camera would occasionally \"disappear\" and for no reason it would \"reappear\".

Can't say much about the Sandisk SSD Performance issue, but I scored 3.300 PCMark 7 marks, so I guess this should be about right.BUT: What a flawed keyboard / touchpad. Asus! Seriously, what were you guys thinking???@ Keyboard: In short: Horrible typing! Keys are waaay too far away from each other.- Fairly often the keys don't react properly although you've pressed themArrow keys are waaay too small (yeah, great design, Asus! Have you thought about functionality?).- No dedicated page up/page down button (same as above: design first, then functionality).I doubt that I'll get used to this. I'll try my best within the next week but will probably send it back.@ Touchpad: OMFG! Asus, what the hell were you guys thinking? I read lots of reviews before buying this laptop and thought \"c'mon, it can't be that be that bad\". But when I actually started to use it I couldn't believe what I found. Asus just shouldn't have tried to imitate the Apple Touchpad. Of course I can use a mouse while working on my desk, but this touchpad will annoy me whenever I'm traveling.- The touchpad is just waaay too big. You cannot write a text without deleting sentences because you accidently mark text with your palm while typing and erasing everything you've typed. This was improved a bit with the latest driver (they increased the \"dead zone\", but it still happens waay too often.- When you tap the touchpad to perform a left-click the delay is just aweful. I presume that because of all this swipe-gesture-interpretation-intelligence integrated into the touchpad hardware it just takes a while to interpret the tap as a click. I don't see how this can be fixed with a driver update.- Why on earth did Asus decide to build in a touchpad that has no left/right mouse button that can be \"felt\" with your finger, i.e. by separating it from the capacitive area? Because the \"border\" between the two buttons is just printed on the touchpad itself you cannot \"feel\" the buttons and therefore quite often perform a leftclick instead of a rightclick, a rightclick instead of a leftclick, or move the mouse instead of clicking.- Due to the fact that the touchpad, including the two \"buttons\" (which are no real buttons but just printed on the touchpad itself), is just one big area with just one \"clicking\" switch underneath there's another annoying flaw: When you perform drag and drop and want to release the left mouse button by lifting your finger from the area that is supposed to be the left mouse button, the switch below doesn't recognize this. Why? Well, even the tiny weight of your other finger (on the touchpad itself) is enough to prevent the switch underneath from releasing. Funny, huh?In short: Don't buy this laptop if you intend to type on the keyboard or use the touchpad. If you don't, well, I'm sure you'll like it... ;)", "Date": "September 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great ultrabook, worth much more than the sale price", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "RYS9MUEOQKISA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this ultrabook as a replacement for my laptop back in January.

Grenier \"randyg\"", "ReviewID": "R37HKPX2J3K9UB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my UX31 for about a week, and I'm so far having a very positive experience.  I'm surprised about the trackpad complaints.  Mine works very well.  It's big, precise, and has a nice click surface.  As I learn the extended gestures, they turn out to very useful (not just fancy gestures for their own sake).I understand the complaints about the keyboard which has a light touch and takes a bit of getting used to.  However, after some use, I think more keyboards should be like this.  Just type a little softer.  Remember how hard you had to press the keys on the old manual typewriters?  Maybe this is the keyboard of the future.  (I think ASUS has made improvements to the trackpad and keyboard, and if it was Apple people would think these were brilliant innovations.)This computer has a fantastic screen.  It's not just the specs (1600 X 900 resolution, 450 nits), but it is just plain pleasant on the eyes.  There are a number of ways to modify screen settings.  Besides the Control Panel, there is an Intel Graphics application and an ASUS application named Splendid.  For simplicity and convenience, you can just press fn + C and it will scroll through various color presets--very similar to preset colors on an HDTV. These include Normal, Gamma Correction, Vivid, Theater, and Soft.  Pretty cool!And like the screen presets, you can also scroll through various power presets with hot key combination fn + space bar. Power presets include High Performance, Entertainment, Quiet Office and Battery Saving modes.  Again, these are convenience pre-sets, and you can access more detailed power settings via the control panel or an icon in the system tray.  (I have mine set for High Performance when it's plugged in and Battery Saving when it's not.)The claims about the UX31's performance are not exaggerated.  Mine powers up in fewer than 15 seconds, and the 2-second resume from sleep is for real.  Everything is very snappy even though I have Norton 360 running in the background monitoring every file and process.A negative for me is that it only came with 128 gigabytes of storage. After installing my required applications, I'm only left with 69 gigabytes of free space.  I like the speed and durability of a solid state drive and I definitely make use of cloud storage, but not having the space available is an inconvenience. Another negative is that the face recognition software doesn't work very well. I'll give it time to \"learn\" and see how it goes.The ASUS engineers really put a lot into the design of the Zenbook.  I really like my new Ultrabook, and I will keep an eye on other ASUS products.UPDATE 12/2012Got to admit, the keyboard is irritating. I think that it's the large track pad.  Thumbs and the inside of the hands keep hitting the trackpad causing havoc in the application.  It's simple to remedy by keeping the thumb sides of your hands turned a little upward, but because I use other computers for work, I'm inconsistent.  Slight pain. No other problems.I installed Windows 8.  Of course, this computer doesn't have a touch screen, but it still works pretty well with the mouse.  Takes a little practice.  No problems with Windows 8 upgrade except that ASUS isn't yet providing any updates to it's utilities to make them Windows 8 apps.  You have to run them on the Windows 7 desktop.  I guess there's no profit in making older models current.I've been watching movies in HD on the 13 inch screen.  Very good quality. I've watched some very fast-paced action movies, and everything was perfectly smooth.  Sound quality is also good, but I prefer to plug in a headset.

As for the Asus updates, it does sound like they rushed this unit out the door. On the Asus site there are 27 updates available. Everything from trackpad to bios. I have no clue which ones to download,[Any tips?] so I only did the ones that were in the popup from Asus when the computer is first used. One was the track pad update and this has helped somewhat, but there are others on the Asus site. Now the pad is too sensitive. Attempted scrolling often becomes an unintentional tap. I see no provision for any adjustment of pad sensitivity. Adding a mouse does not help when I use it on my lap.  The screen is very sharp, but my last netbook, [Asus S-101] had a matt screen. I miss the matt screen a lot. This screen is like a mirror and detracts from the viewing experience. To use this laptop on a desk is fine.

WiFi performance is fine, but I did go into the advanced settings in Power 4 Gear and change the wireless card setting to full power. It had a desktop display gadget for P 4 gear, but I somehow lost it and can't find a way to retrieve it. I miss it because sometimes it goes into battery saving mode for no reason.

It is extremely thin and light for it's power and the screen is pretty nice and crisp when viewed straight on. For angled view the screen can appear to have blacked out portions.When I first got this I had some kind of error that caused the computer to not boot and give a very scary warning. But after letting it rest and restarting a couple of times I have never had this problem again. The touch pad is also sometimes not very responsive and sometimes in the beginining it actually stopped altogether. Both the criticle boot error and the touch pad problem seemed to go away with updates installed.The sound for this computer is fantastic for the size of the frame. There is virtually no distortion and the lows and highs are easily distinguishable. Of course it always helps to connect to a larger set of good quality speakers but for the size the sound from the built in speakers is fantastic. Better then most full size laptops and even some HDTVs!!!The power cord connector seems very loose and the light on the connector has a hard time indicating that it is charging. There is a connector to get the video out to a VGA but you have to use a supplied mini VGA adaptor. There is also a mini HDMI port. There are two USB ports: A 2.0 on the left and a 3.0 on the right.The headphone jack also serves as a microphone input jack. I am not sure how that works for a headset with mic but most headset mic combinations are USB anyway.This Ultrabook comes with the 13.3 inch screen, COREi5, and a 128 GB SSD. I highly recomend the 13.3 inch screen over anything else. The size difference is huge while not adding to the overall size of the actuall computer. Plus the 11 inch screen only has one USB port. I have read that the COREi7 doesn't add that much speed. If you can afford it I would also recommend going with the 256 GB SSD for added storage unless you have a large external drive or cloud service.

This happens with or without an external mouse - and when I am careful to touch only the keys.  I have also noticed that the battery life isn't what I expected.  If you want a nice looking computer to impress your friends in the coffee shop, and plan to use it only for checking e-mail or surfing the web, this one's for you.  If you plan to use it for serious work, you might want to consider something else.", "Date": "January 20, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Intel Core i5 Processor
