{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great workhouse computer for business", "Author": "Eagle Vision", "ReviewID": "R2U2CYQ7HMACBQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Dell Latitude line of notebooks are well built business machines.  The Latitudes and XPS lines are a tier higher than the entry-level Inspiron Series.The case is constructed of metal with plastic trim along the LCD monitor.  There are 4 USB ports which allow for a variety of peripherals to be attached such as portable hard drives.  There is a headphone and microphone jack and an outlet for a monitor.  The keyboard is comfortable to the touch.  In addition to the mousepad, there is a pointing stick with 2 buttons below the space key, allowing for either to control the cursor.  The 'spill proof' keyboard is one of the biggest assets (I have only spilled a drink on it once, where I just wiped off the keyboard without a problem in function).The WIFI capabilities is reliable and easy to set up.  The hard drive is quiet, as is the optical drive.  The strike zone hard drive is resistant to light drops.Performance of the notebook is excellent with the Dual Core processors.  This notebook easily handles virus scanning, working on a MS Office document, internet browser and listening to music without any problem.  The integrated graphics allows for basic games like Tiger Woods Golf, Mafia, NHL Hockey, the Godfather, for example.Battery life is very good for the 6 cell (about 4 hours).One of the greatest attractions that I have for this line of notebooks is the lack of 'bloatware' - unnecessary programs that are installed into your computer (trial programs, multiple internet service providers, advertisements, etc).Overall, with a spill resistant keyboard and drop zone hard drive, this notebook will take the daily knocks of the regular commuter.  This is no Panasonic Toughbook but it will survive your daily use.VERDICTHighly recommend this notebook.", "Date": "December 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Bargain Notebook", "Author": "M. DiStasio \"Hack\"", "ReviewID": "R2WQFC6R9GQ6AU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the D620 for my daughter in college when her 2 yr old HP notebook died due to an overheating problem (long story).  After verifying that the D620 worked properly by connecting to the internet and installing XP SP 3, I moved over one of the RAM chips (for a total of 1.5 GB) and the harddrive from the HP.  I then installed Windows 7 and recovered her data files (I didn't really expect a college student to use the flash drives that I gave her for backups). Finally, I installed software including Office 7.  Throughout the process the D620 performed flawlessly.  I tested it by running DVDs, Office apps and videos over the internet (after I set up a wireless connection).  This is one fine notebook, very fast and with a good display.  Its only \"short comings\" are obvious from the specs, i.e., no web cam, no media slots and no DVD burner.  But these are clearly minor issues given the price.", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "glad I did this", "Author": "nan", "ReviewID": "R1OR47RK6XSH0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I didn't have a lot of money to spend on a computer and all of the chain stores that I had gone into to buy a computer did not have the service or the selection that I wanted.

Otherwise, the laptop booted up as if it had just come out of the store.  The sellers dont garuntee the batteries, so I bought an extra one for it, but, come to find out, the battery the laptop came with is fine. Now I have two.  I also upgraded the laptops ram to 4gig.  Probly didnt need to, for what Ill use the laptop for, but the ram was cheap so there was no reason not to.  As far as how the computer works, its great.  Was nice and clean, and everything comes up fast. Im no computer expert, so I cant list a whole bunch of technical details for you, but I like the laptop very much.  Its everything it was advertised to be, attractive, and works very well for everything I use it for.UPDATE: Nearly two years after purchase, this laptop is still working wonderfully for me.

I guess I was just so happy using it that I forgot. Was shopping for a cheap (but high quality) 2nd laptop and immediately thought of the dell 410 and 620. I own and use both. The 410 is lighter; the 620 has more features. In this case I am looking for more features, so the Dell 620 is a better choice. Also the 410 uses IDE disks which are getting harder to find; the 620 uses SATA, so disks are cheap and easy to find.So I started shopping on Amazon and noticed so many poor reviews. I can't image why. If you buy a used laptop, expect to replace the battery almost immediately and the hard drive sometime. They're givens and should be figured into the cost. In the case of the machine I bought in 2011, I'm still using both the hard disk and the battery that came with it. Thinking it is about time to replace the battery, but think I will try reconditioning it once more. Replacing a battery for a new laptop after two years is not unreasonable. Using a battery from a reconditioned computer for two years is awesome.One of the reasons I like the Dell 410 and 620 so much is that it is easy to buy extra hard disks (I put different operating systems on them) and slip them in and out. No need to jeopardize my work configuration in order to try something new. Just slip in an extra drive, copy the cloned backup image to it and experiment to my hearts content. If everything goes sideways I just slip my main work disk back in and pick up where I left off. Wanna play around with kali linux, mint, or the latest version of something else? Just slip in an extra disk and you're good to go.I'd happily purchase a reconditioned dell 620 (or 410) from any highly rated Amazon vendor. Check it out as soon as you get it to ensure you get the benefit of any warranty. Have fun.
