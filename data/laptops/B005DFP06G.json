The battery indicator said it was experiencing \"temporary battery failure\" which after some google searching I found out basically meant the battery was done for good. The Dell support was BRUTAL. Got the run around, everyone tried to sell me an additional service plan when all I wanted was to get a new battery under the original warranty.However, I will say Amazon was AMAZING about the return. I printed off a label, threw it back in the box, and sent it back no charge. They refunded me the full amount with no questions!", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005DFP06G"}}
