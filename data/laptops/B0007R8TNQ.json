{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Works Splendidly.", "Author": "Gary Peterson", "ReviewID": "R1JZBONCJ3FTX0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have an iMac in my office and I like it very much. So, when it came time for buying a home computer, I got the same iMac, but got the version with the larger screen and more memory at the advice of my wife. Well, we've blown two hard drives on the home iMac (covered under warranty, except for the lost files) and I'm rather annoyed. Nevertheless, I really like it as a computer. Alas, my wife likes it too and she's constantly working on eBay things. Too much so, in my opinion. I've been constantly on her for working at the computer all the time and blocking my usage. As a solution, she gave me an iBook G4 for Christmas (1907).I really like this little iBook. It's been completely trouble free, and in that respect is better than either of my iMacs. It's fast and my enjoyment of working on it greatly increased after I purchased a Mighty Mouse to go with it. I'm a college professor and I give about 12 classroom lectures per week. I also give visiting lectures (about 2 per month) all over Southern California. I store my PowerPoint presentations in the computer and it works out very well. I simply walk into a classroom or hall, plug in the equipment and I'm ready to go. Everything works real well, as long as I'm the one setting it up. When others have set it up, I've had a couple problems which they then blame on Apple equipment. There's an \"Apple Phobia\" that's widely prevelant. That's nonsense. It's their own ineptitude that's the problem. This is a real nifty computer and works splendidly for my purposes.Gary Peterson", "Date": "February 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "The original netbook!", "Author": "Margaret Picky", "ReviewID": "RHTIDMKA3KH81", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had a 12\" iBook G4 since 2005 and it's still my favorite notebook for browsing the internet, writing letters, and even reading pdf's. It's very lightweight and I consider the screen the perfect size. It's held up very well. One of the keys has a hairline crack and one of the rubber feet on the bottom fell off but I clean it every month or so and it still looks almost new.My only criticism is that it gets a little warm so I keep it on top of a clipboard when holding it in my lap. No viruses, no crashes, no worries.When netbooks started becoming popular a couple of years ago, I had to laugh because I already have a lightweight, handy netbook. In fact, I'm using it right now to write this review. Given a choice between a new Asus or Dell netbook or a used iBook G4 for the same price, I would take the G4 without thinking about it for a second.", "Date": "March 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Misleading advertizing", "Author": "W.
