{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Powerful, light-weight, Ubuntu-ready", "Author": "Evan", "ReviewID": "R15BWAEX8MVKVF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this laptop for two days so far and it's a pleasure to use as well as gorgeous to look at!It cold boots in six seconds and wakes up from suspend-to-RAM in two; the IPS screen is excellent and the i5 CPU, 4 GB RAM, and SSD give the system incredible speed. There are some downsides: I'm still getting used to the trackpad (no distinct buttons - a first for me), and it isn't quite as thin as the marketing pictures would suggest (though the listed product dimensions are accurate), but I think this laptop is a great deal for $800.After it arrived, I booted into Windows 8 to make sure all the hardware was working. After specifically testing the function keys and the speed of restarts, I updated to the latest BIOS, disabled UEFI Secure Boot, and then installed Ubuntu 13.04 Desktop 64-bit from a USB flash drive. Another reviewer lamented the space lost to the pre-existing partitions (I found boot, efi, Windows recovery, Windows OS, and factory recovery), but I opted to let Ubuntu have the entire disk (minus a couple hundred MB for two boot partitions). After formatting, it gave me 117.3 GB total, with 4.5 GB used by the OS after installing.Once I was running Ubuntu 13.04, almost all of the top-row function keys (e.g. sleep, keyboard backlight adjust, screen brightness adjust) worked out-of-the-box. The exceptions are that wireless enable/disable doesn't always seem to work and I haven't had a chance to test the video output selector. The screen auto brightness doesn't work, nor do the function keys attached to C, V, and Space (in the factory configuration those last three were attached to software bundled by Asus within Windows, so I suspect that I could configure apps in Ubuntu to respond in a similar fashion, but I have not tested this).The Bluetooth, USB-to-Ethernet (using the included adapter), web cam, built-in mic, and SD card reader components have all also been tested and they all work well without any configuration.If you're looking for a sleek, portable, Ubuntu-ready laptop which doesn't sacrifice power or break the bank, I would recommend giving this laptop a chance.== 2013-11-02: Edited review to add comments after almost five months of use ==This has continued to be a fantastic mobile computer for me. The performance of this laptop, coupled with its slim and lightweight nature, make this a very easy and plentifully capable computer to take with me on trips or to meetings.It's not perfect: I've gotten more used to the touchpad, but it will still sometimes 'tap' when I'm typing on the keyboard and my palm brushes the surface of the touchpad. I think this is due to the touchpad driver in Ubuntu, and while I've tried a couple of workarounds I've not been happy with the results and have reverted back to the 'stock' Ubuntu driver configuration.I have not yet tried Ubuntu 13.10, though I'm looking forward to giving it a spin after any \"early adopter\" bugs are found and fixed. :-)As I said in my original review, if you're interested in a Ubuntu laptop I think you'll find this is a great option!", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beautiful piece of kit with a couple caveats...", "Author": "Imran K.", "ReviewID": "R218PEYW3V1AG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Slim, solidly built machine. Uni-body construction. Fewer ports built in, but a VGA and Ethernet dongles are included in their own matching case. #1 feature: the MATTE Full HD screen. Feels like I'm working on 15\"+ screen. I thought it would make texts too fine to read comfortably, but the default setting for text is set at 125% at full HD and is very easy on the eyes. And yes, its matte, not glossy (THANK YOU ASUS!!!). Check out notebookcheck.net review of this and other machines.As mentioned, there's a couple caveats to owning this puppy. If you video chat a lot, either invest in an add-on digital camera as the built in camera on this harks back to the 90' cell phone camera - 0.3 MP and painfully slow. I can't put it any other way: the camera sucks. Its deliberate, as the thinness of the lid at that point limits the camera. If you cannot live with this nor be bothered to buy a separate digi-cam, this ain't your fix. Look elsewhere.The other concern is more important. Though its listed as a 128 Gig SSD, only 66 Gigs are actually useable, as the rest are defined for Windows, backup, etc. I haven't had time to investigate all the software that comes along with it from ASUS. While I abhor bloatware, the few programmes that I did check out so far are essential add-ons for the full Win 8 experience, such as the ASUS Touchpad software for example. Some others may choose to reduce these partitions for more usable room but I don't need to go there just yet. having a flash drive or cloud adds lots of extra storage for files, which is what I'm planning on doing anyway. I know that 2 gig out of the 4 total are permanently on the board, so that the RAM can be upgraded in future. I'm not yet sure about the SSD, though it would seem highly unlikely that it cannot be upgraded.While others cannot overlook the poor excuse of a digi-cam in 21st century, nor the actual 66 gigs of useable space on the SSD out of the gates, for my intents and purposes, it fits the bill, which is why I'd give it 4.5 stars (if I could...).", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Looks like a great product but will cause you many a head-ache in the long term", "Author": "Reviewer", "ReviewID": "RP9K7I8Z5Q7YD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "At face value, this ultrabook is an incredible deal; powerful processor w/ intel hd 4000 graphics, great build, an amazing screen resolution and from a historically fantastic company.  However, after a year of ownership, I cannot recommend it.I'll place this here to save some timeTL:DR - Power adapter failed after 4 months, not covered by warranty.  Hard drive fails (bootsector failures) after 13 months -  return to ASUS in California for repair (lost all data).  Returned within 1.5 weeks functioning.  1.5 months after, hard drive fails again.  Can't even reset with factory reset.I've been using ASUS as an avid gamer and computer builder since the early 2000s. Before the began producing their own netbooks and laptops, ASUS was known among the computer hardcore as one of the premiere producers of hardware components.  I learned over the years to seek out their products because of the incredible build quality. As the old adage goes, they don't build things like they used to.I eagerly awaited the release of this gen zenbook, and was one of the first to purchase it in DC at a local computer super store.  The machine performance has been fantastic, but since the computer has been running for a full year, hardware is now starting to fail, and in epic fashion.I first began to received BSOD about 3 months ago.  Having been a Windows user for quick some time, I'm not usually worried when the occasional BSOD occurs.  However, they began to become more frequent, occurred anywhere from 1-2 hours after power-up to 2-10 minutes after power-up.  I'm a pretty experienced user, as well as a programmer, so I'm not uncomfortable diagnosing computer problems.  I had a separate linux partition, and attempted to use some linux utilities and even resorted to systemrescuecd to diganose the problems.  Turned out that the hard drive had completely failed, with boot records that weren't recoverable.I contacted ASUS support, was told it was past the warranty period, and that I would be informed about how much it would cost after I shipped it to California.  To give credit to ASUS service, they actually repaired the computer without charging me, and it was returned to me within 2 weeks.  I have since had the recently repaired ASUS for just over a month, and the hard drive has failed again.This computer is used for school, browsing, and programming.  I'm an undergrad student and the unreliability I've experienced with this computer has been a really eye-opening experience regarding the quality of product that ASUS is producing right now.

Comparing spec for spec your getting much more for your money with this machine compared to the MacBook Air. The screen is really something you have to see to believe. The difference between a TN panel (the standard) and this IPS panel is amazing. This screen is so bright and being 1080p gives a super high pixels per inch. It literally boots completely into Windows in around 10 seconds. I did find the SSD to be a little small, but if you delete the recovery partition on it, you get much more space to play with (around 20GB). It isn't a big deal. You can always create a USB rediscovery drive in Windows if you'd like. That gives me around 110GB total, which is also much more than what you get with the Surface Pro (89GB total).The build quality is also very good. I previously owned a Asus UL30VT, which was considered and ultra-portable computer in 2010. However the build quality was very poor. Many panels creaked and moved, over time some parts just fell off.This is not the case with this machine. The core of it is what feels like a solid piece of aluminum. And the screen and bezel also is put together very nicely.Over all it looks and feels like a very solid, premium quality notebook. I would say that 799$ (what I paid) was cheap for this computer.The verdict: If you want a computer that's super thin, has an awesome display, is super fast... Look no further.UPDATEThe micro HDMI port has given out after only 3 days of use. I purchased an adapter to use it on a desktop monitor or my TV. However it just gave out. It appears to not have been soldered onto the motherboard correctly, because if I wiggle it up and down, it starts to work. This is very frustrating and was one of the main features of the computer for me. I may be returning it. I have owned Asus machines before, and I can tell you that little stuff like this always quits working on them. Still a great buy for the price on here.

Price, design and -- after a series of updates to the trackpad -- overall usability. It's an Air imposter, but a very good one with a nicer display. On its own, I'd rate it 4 to 4.5 stars.Here's the rub: It's made by a company called ASUS, and I have NEVER had worse support. You can roll your dice (as I did) but if you come up \"snake eyes\" you're screwed (and, yes, I did).Here's my story:The laptop SSD hard drive died and windows no longer booted. Recovery options didn't work. It just blue-screened. The good news: It was 3 weeks before my warranty expired. I called customer service, opened an RMA, and after going through a series of calls and emails to provide proof of coverage, I sent the device to ASUS. I am in Mexico working for several months working, so it cost me $100 to ship it. Far enough. So far, so good.Here's where everything starts to go wrong: I receive an email from technical repair center with a bill, and claim my device is out of warranty. OK, I thought, it's just a mix up. I reply to the email and call customer service on the phone for good measure. I am assured I am good to go.About a week or so later I get an email from the repair center, saying the device is out of warranty. I reply that it was in warranty when it broke -- and when I opened the RMA. I call customer service again, give them the low-down, and again am assured it will be expedited. I watch for status update on the RMA. It stays on \"hold.\"I go through the customer service drill two more times... and only after 45 minutes into the second time does the agent tell me that customer actually cannot DO anything to help me. I was getting the run-around. I have to work with the REPAIR CENTER, he tells me, which has no phone support. Email support has response times of 7-8 days.I send another email to \"John Lu\" at the repair center, outlining the events up to this point, including dates, and why my laptop is in warranty.Meanwhile, I had planned for one our visitors to deliver the laptop back to Mexico to avoid another $100 shipping shipping charge. The first visitor comes and leaves. The second visitor was arriving 10 days later.John Lu responds a week later: 'Sorry for the mixup! The laptop is in warranty. But, you need to get a Warranty RMA.'I call customer service again, probably my 10th call, and confirm the RMA is a warranty RMA. Days go by. The next guest comes and goes. The RMA status remains \"hold.\"Seven weeks after opening the RMA -- and a month after having my laptop in their possession -- ASUS has done nothing. I am actually much worse off than before. I can't get it fixed, because they have it, and if they DO return it, I have to pay to have it shipped back to Mexico.I've opened a complain with the BBB, and considering the massive number of hours of spent on this, I am considering a small claim against the company (which will likely require flying back to the States to file).SO: If you're feeling lucky -- by all means this is a great laptop. However, if something goes wrong, and you end up in some customer service cul de sac like me, you're gonna wish you'd bought a Mac Air.UPDATE: My laptop was finally fixed!

It would seem to have inherent design/manufacture problems to do with its power management system and the motherboard.What is more concerning is that ASUS does not provide an acceptable level of 'ASUS owned' technical/service backup for their products. In California, the product has to go back to a small independent service company in LA which doesn't seem to get too much support and backing from ASUS. The same is true in Australia - only a handful of small companies providing service for the whole of the country.I bought mine on Amazon in 2011 for around $1500 (mine is the 256GB SSHD) - it's motherboard died just outside the warranty period. That cost $600 to replace from the LA service agent. Within a few months it developed a fault which causes it to not be able to go into sleep mode and be 're-awakened', without the battery being run down; recharged then re-booted. I've read in forums this is a common problem which ASUS just doesn't want to know about.

That link is here: [...]I am using the most recent version and it is now working as expected. The Elantouch driver is also more configurable.Other thoughts: For some reason, this computer (vanilla Windows 8) only displays programs that are set to run at boot in the Task Manger's Startup tab. If they are disabled it won't show them, as it does on my desktop (which is running WIndows 8 Pro, so that may be the difference). I also ran into a problem where, when using Ninite.com to install Steam and Skype, both programs somehow became set to run at boot but were not present at all in the Startup tab and did not have \"start with Windows\" set in their preferences.

The laptop arrived in a slick black box with a sleeve and little accessory bag.  The form factor and size are great and I was able to dual-boot Win 7 and Linux Mint with no problems.  Mint runs great out of the box except the power profile needs some tweaking when running on battery.I use this laptop for travel and field-work and I was really impressed with how rugged the laptop was and how light and easy to clean the metal finish is.  The display has great colors and the SSD is really fast.  The video processing lets me run Steam and other games.  I didn't love the touchpad which is too large and I was always hitting it with my palm while typing.  (Both Windows and Linux have settings to disable the touchpad while typing but neither seems to work.)  That was the only negative I had, and I thought I had found the perfect laptop for me.HOWEVER after nine months I started having a problem with the internal cable connection between the base and the screen which caused the monitor to flicker off for seconds at a time until I adjusted the screen angle.  Obtaining an RMA was no problem and they supplied a FedEx label to ship it to the return center at no charge.  Great so far...But then I didn't hear anything for three weeks.  Finally I get an e-mail confirming the repair was covered under warranty but they wouldn't perform it because it required replacing the monitor and the monitor also had \"non-warranty\" damage on it.  They included a picture of the monitor with a \"scratch\" in the corner that I had never noticed and could barely see in the picture.  Was it even there when I shipped it out?  And how does that invalidate my warranty?!  The e-mail also stated that because of the non-warranty damage they wouldn't even return the laptop unless I paid within two days for return shipping and handling...otherwise my laptop would be \"scrapped\".  They instead gave me the option to pay over $200 for the \"non-warranty\" repair and then they would complete the warranty repairs.I gave into extortion and paid for the monitor.  I received it back in another month, not in the original ASUS black box I had shipped it in, but wrapped in a cut-up piece of cardboard with no padding!  I opened up the laptop that I always kept meticulously clean to find greasy fingerprints and FOOD CRUMBS all over it.  Apparently they replaced the screen because the new one is dim and has a weird yellow-tint to the display...but they didn't fix the cable problem and the display still flickers out!  Worse still, they decided to \"update\" the BIOS for some reason to a version that doesn't allow me to disable Secureboot so I can't re-install linux.I've been trying for two months now to get resolution from ASUS service about this but they are always \"investigating\" the issue and when I called yesterday they decided my laptop was now outside the warranty period and I would have to call some other service number....which connects to an operator who only seems to speak Chinese.

I thought this notebook with exceed my expectations and blow me out of the water like their other products do.Zenbook at first glance is sleek, beautiful, and elegant. The specifications seem to be top-tier as well, especially for its price range. I have had this unit since August of 2013, and after a few short months of owning it I have already had a slew of problems.The first (minor) problem about the unit was when I first purchased it. There is a slight bleed around the border of the display right out of the package. I googled this problem and it seems to be a big occurrence with not just the UX31A, but a lot of other ASUS notebooks as well. Okay, I could deal with that, no problem.The second problem was a bit more annoying. One day, going about my business I just turned on the unit, and specific keys on the keyboard STOPPED working all together. I could not press a slew of keys -- 'A, Z, X, C, L, ;' and some function keys. I contacted ASUS customer service about the problem, and being that I encountered this problem only within two months of owning the unit, I thought it would be an easy replacement; however, I was totally wrong. I would've had to send the unit in, pay shipping, wait 7-14 business days, and hope that it was fixable. This situation was not ideal as it was the middle of midterm season in pharmacy school. Again, I googled this problem and it was prevalent in these units. I ended up finding a way to repair it myself without having to send it in. And the problem seems to stem from a poorly manufactured internal unit.The third problem was bleeding in the display, again. Although this time around, it was right smack dab in the middle of the screen about 3 inches wide. This was especially noticeable on a dark or black background, and not so much on lighter backgrounds. This made viewing powerpoints or movies very annoying -- reminded me of old school plasma TV screens. Yet again, I googled this problem and while not as prevalent as the other two problems stated above, it was still documented by frustrated consumers like myself. Through researching this, it seems like the light bleeding of the display and the eventual one in the middle is the result of the display being a bit too fragile. This problem was only fixable through their repair center, which is few and far between, so most likely you will have to ship it in and get it back over a month later.Setting up the RMA with ASUS customer service took 4 days, packaging the unit to make sure it is in line with their warranty took 1 day, shipping the package to them takes 3-5 days (~$40 with insurance), waiting for them to repair it takes 7-14 WORKING days, and then having them ship it back to you will take another 5-7 days.Summary: The unit is poorly built, problems will eventually come. ASUS Customer Service was below average at best, their representatives are nice, but the system they have in place to problem solve is very, very poor. Even if I get the unit back fixed, I anticipate that I will run into more problems within the next few months.

This causes a giant mark right in the center of the screen which is VERY noticeable when viewing dark scenes.Another issue is the annoying touchpad.  It will frequently move your mouse around to random locations.

Bought this computer as a replacement for an original HP Envy 15 that I've had for 3 years. The two things I was looking for primarily were 1) battery life and 2) speed. My last PC had unbelievable spec, the hardware is competitive even now. However, it overheated like you wouldn't believe, and the battery whittled down from the 2 hours at purchase all the way down to 0 (I literally removed it as it just added to the weight).Here are my thoughts on this product, the Asus Zenbook Prime UX31a.PROS:Battery (5-6 hours reliably, a little more if you're frugal)Looks (I regularly receive compliments for this guy's pure attractiveness)Screen (It is gorgeous. I searched long and hard for ultrabooks with a full (1920x1080) resolution, this was one of the very few)Boot Times (The SSD has been outstanding, restart times are usually around 10-12 seconds)Price: (I bought it for $800, which I think was tremendous value)CONS:Touchpad (finicky, update helped, but swipe from the left Windows 8 functions are frustrating)Ports (requires a micro-USB, which is annoying, but a $8 cable purchase remedied that. Only 2 USB's as well)Limited Storage & Graphics (128 gb memory, and no integrated graphics card)I know quite a bit about computers and electronics. In the end, if you're truly looking for an ultrabook, this is a great buy. Its significantly cheaper than a MacBook Air or a Samsung Series 9, just as good looking, and compromises in few ways. The MacBook does have a big win in terms of battery life, but in the end the Asus more than makes up for it with the beautiful LED 1080p screen (essentially equivalent to Apple's \"retina display\").If you are concerned about storage, along with the computer I bought a 2 TB portable external hard disk for $120. It's almost as small as a deck of cards, and I use that for supplementary storage. It's been a great decision, there's no need for base memory past 128 gb. I've had no performance issues either, the i5 has been more than sufficient for me. If anything, I learned from my last PC that upgrading the spec only serves to cause your machine to overheat and ruins the battery.I have done little to no gaming on this machine, so I cannot speak to that, and considering a lack of integrated graphics hardware (past Intel basic stuff), this wouldn't get my vote for serious gamers.If you're a college student, or just someone looking for a portable, great looking computer that will honestly satisfy your needs, this is the one for you.One bad note: when I first received this model, the computer I received was defective and dead. It couldn't boot past the BIOS. I called Asus and they informed me that the hard disk was likely disconnected inside the model and I would have to send it in.
