Also the Java that was installed on my system had errors in it.  I had to call my computer service company to help me get things to where they should have been from the get go.  I did not use Dell service, because I wanted someone with a clear speaking voice to help me.  I use PlumChoice and they are techs from this country and they speak clearly and are very knowledgeable.
