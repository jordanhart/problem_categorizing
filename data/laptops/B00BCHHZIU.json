But Acers are starting to rise in price so when I came across this, I gave it a long look and then bought it.  Screen is sharp and clear but a bit marginal if you're into HD. The OD is dual layer super multi, but won't manage blu ray. Speakers are the best I've heard on a laptop. Keyboard is okay. I'd say really good if the right shift key weren't abbreviated in order to accommodate the number pad. The negatives? One. Not nearly enough USB ports. I've got a Belkin USB 2.0 4-Port Ultra-Mini Hubfor USB2 but not 3 so I'll be putting more money in it eventually. Still, it's very good computer at a very reasonable price and what else can you ask for?5/27/2013 I just discovered another plus. Win 8 forces you (at the moment) to hover your mouse near the upper right of your screen in order to bring up what replaces the start menu. This Asus X55A computer has an upgraded touch-pad that allows you to swipe solving a vexing irritant (Hovering to find controls). I now raise my rating to 4.8 because 1 USB 2.0 and one v3.0 are simply not enough unless you have hubs or a fancy external monitor with additional ports. For this \"frugal\" shopper, that's a serious negative.", "Date": "May 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "cheap, multi-purpose, but a bit heavy", "Author": "ibanker", "ReviewID": "R3T2PR86QMHRDG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just bought a unit of this today for the function that its has to offer and for it's price.  it's got a built-in nvida card that allows me to play my online games smoothly and watch movies seamlessly.  it's a bit heavy to be honest, but I won't complain about it because it has a 15+ inch display plus a good hardware spec to carry me through out the day.", "Date": "April 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Easy and basic PC", "Author": "dede", "ReviewID": "R8ATI3LYTZOEM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great little PC it was the best price for me.

It's thin, light, and has a great battery life. It has had no problems running anything yet, except Knights of the Old Republic 2, but that's because the game is old and I need to find some sort of compatibility fix. I have had no problems running the 3D modelling software known as Blender. It's also very pretty. The keys are responsive and the entire mouse pad clicks which makes it very easy to drag and drop stuff and use internet (a laptop first).No disk drive though. That means it's borderline impossible to fix the true problem with this thing. Windows 8. The OS is such a terrible mess. I shouldn't have to use a search function to open notepad or calculator. The start button was kind of essential. I tried installing Ubunutu and Windows 7, but due to changes in how Windows 8 boots, Ubuntu can't work. Windows 7 can get some of the way, but you have to make a custom install image because it doesn't natively have USB 3 drivers, so your usb install stick won't work after the first install reboot.So, as I said above, the hardware is fantastic. The OS is crap. If I had known that it would be almost impossible to remove Windows 8 I would not have bought this computer.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Windows 8!!!!", "Author": "Brian J.

The second was one HP which lasted for 6-7 years and it was in perfect condition. Then I decided to say good bye to my HP and buy this (JUNK) laptop from ASUS. It was working fine for the first couple of months, then it started showing problems. It constantly froze, and i thought this is normal as because laptop does freezes at time. Then again, i do not use my laptop to play games or any other exhausting things. I just use it to write paper, edit pictures and to watch movies at time and yes to listen to music when i m doing my work. So i only used my laptop 2-3 hours a day sometimes 5 hours when i was editing but that is only few time a month.  It had been just about 5 months since i purchased my laptop and a day came when my laptop would freeze 3 or 4 times a day and the only way it would respond was by turning off the power manually ( lost my work) . Then i send the product back to Asus, and they send the product back. The problem was not fixed, the problem actually became worst. I had to re send the laptop to Asus and i just received it today, i opened the laptop 2 hours ago and it froze. I dont know what to tell you, this is the first product i bought from Asus and i m having problem.If i had known few things about Asus's service quality i would have never purchased any Asus product. My wife gave me a ASUS transformer Pad yesterday and today i m going to tell her to return it. There is no customer service in ASUS, they just want you to buy the product they sell and even if it is a junk, they want you to have it. I say, buy any other brand besides Asus.Firstly, if anything happens to the computer ( even when its ASUS's fault, you as a consumer will have to pay for shipping), ASUS only pays for one way shipping which means you are spending almost $20 just to have them fix your laptop. It is wasting money. They do not pay for the shipping. Secondly, they will not exchange the product for a newer one even when the problem is not fixed when you send the product to ASUS. Recently I had to pay $20 the first time i sent laptop and the second time ASUS sent me a fedex lable but i had to pack it in a box which cost $25 (this was required by Fedex as i was shipping laptop). I did not have laptop for couple of days, which means i could not do my work on time. I should have been smart and bought Apple, sony, Dell or HP, because their customer service is standard. I give two thumbs down for ASUS. I m never going to buy their product and i tell my friends and my family not to buy anything from Asus.Hope this helps..", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "ehhh.. built in microphone is terrible", "Author": "K.

If there was no background noise, they could not hear me speak.The screen was also temperamental and sometimes would flicker or not be able to be seen upon login. I returned it.

My siblings and I purchased this for my mom last year for Christmas.  It has yet to be functional.  Main problem was Windows 8, which is NOT user friendly when converting from Windows 7.
