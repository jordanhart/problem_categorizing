{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great laptop for the price!", "Author": "david", "ReviewID": "RGOAO5PBU93OW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great little computer for the price. I've looked at many brands, including HP & Dell, and as/of this review, no-one came close to matching it on a price-per-spec basis.Dose it have a disk-drive? No, but it doesn't say that it dose in its list of features. Disk-drive are on there way out and in the future, we'll see more and more pc's without them. You can buy an external-drive pretty inexpensive these days if you need one to install old software or games. Will it get finger prints on it? Yes, but it's a TOUCHSCREEN!One benefit with this pc is that it's a 4th gen i3. Which is more power efficient than a 3rd gen i3 and gives a modest speed boost of about 7% CPU without the added heat or battery drain. Where this laptop shines however is in its 4400 graphics, which is about twice as much GPU over the 3rd gen HD model, better for things like gaming and photoshop.Looks nice. Good build quality. Has a usb 3.0 port. 6 gigs of ram. A 750 GB Hard-drive. And a Touchscreen. Over-all a good little laptop. A big win for the price!", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poor Quality", "Author": "Shadow Queen", "ReviewID": "R3QKRNYF5WLOO9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The power cord jack broke after 5 months and still under warranty.  Acer customer service said that 1) I had to ship it back at my expense 2) if it was covered they would repair the computer but wipe all of my data and 3) if it wasn't covered it would be $260 and they would still wipe out my data.  Wow!  What a way to honor a warranty.  I had it repaired at a local repair shop for $40.  As soon as I said I had an Acer they said 'you don't even have to tell us the problem-all of them have it'.  And they didn't erase my data.  Do not buy this product.  A company is only as good as its commitment to its customers.", "Date": "May 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great but missing an Optical Drive", "Author": "Anna M.

If you need one then i would still recommend this laptop but with an external cd drive or to install one because it still has the bay.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Computer", "Author": "Joshua", "ReviewID": "RN7ZE3H6EW8DX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Light weight, touch screen, I3 - 4th Generation Processor, extended keyboard all for the price of a value laptop.

Some complained about the screen, I love it , it is very clear.  This laptop was  worth the money, some people complain because their is no internal optical drive, well if they new how to read, it says that THERE IS NOT ONE. I knew it and that is fine with me, I have an external drive that is better than what comes in computers.  Windows 8.1 is new to me, It did not take me long to figure it out, I like it, and the more I use it the more I like it. you can't go wrong with this laptop, the touch screen is nice, but I use the mouse most of the time. Just watch videos on how to use windows 8.1 and that will help people like myself a lot. Windows 7 is much more user friendly. The only thing that stinks about this laptop is the speakers, they are underneath and very small, I recomend wearing headphones if you watch videos and play games.  FOR THE MONEY THIS PRODUCT DESERVES 5 STARS EASY.", "Date": "May 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Im very happy", "Author": "Fabricio Piccini", "ReviewID": "RAIJ4CY9IC3HX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "if you wanna a good pc with good features for a low price, this is the machine. but dont do it like me and forget to verify if the pc has a optical drive. because, this one, dont have any. but the features are clear, im the dumb who forgot to check.", "Date": "May 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great for the $$", "Author": "David W.

I was hoping to find a touchscreen and a 4th Gen Intel processor in this price range, and this computer was the only one that I found. I found that it was accurately advertised. It is very light for a 15.6\" laptop, and the touchscreen is responsive. 10-key is handy if you use the manual keyboard. Windows 8 takes a bit to get used to, but it is worth it.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "i don't like it", "Author": "Fortunato Beronilla", "ReviewID": "R6WN1VOAEQA8D", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It is my first time to use a laptop with touch screen and I am frustrated with this purchase because there is no manual to read instruction so it takes time for me  to learn and explore. The resolution is not great compared to lower price Toshiba with the same  gig for hard drive and RAM.  I have used Toshiba and HP Pavilion which I prefer more than, after trying Acer.
