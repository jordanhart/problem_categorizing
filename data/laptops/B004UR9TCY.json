Lenovo makes excellent machines.Pros:  Thinkpad Build Quality, Keyboard, HD IPS display, Battery life, Docking station, All day battery sliceCons:  Price for a tricked out modelI purchased the i7 model and then added an after market Intel OEM 300 GB SSD.  This thing flys.  Windows Experience Index is a 6 due to graphics but processor, memory and hard disk (SSD) all score in the mid-7's.  I had heard great things about the IPS display and without a doubt, this is the best computer screen I have ever had.  The resolution could be higher but with my vision it is certainly acceptable.  The viewing angles are fantastic and the screen is bright.As the previous reviewer mentioned, the X220 has a 7 mm drive rather than the standard 9.5 mm.  Intel's 320 series SSD's with models ending in 301 are 7 mm high and come in sizes up to 600 GB.  I used Acronis to clone the hard disk to the SSD, swapped the drives and was up and running in about 2 hours, 1.95 hours of that for the cloning process.I was torn between buying this, a MacBook Air or the Lenovo X1.  The other two may look better but in terms of pure performance, tremendous battery life and the IPS Display the X220 wins out IMO.  Build quality is fantastic.  It may look like the X200 or X201 that came before it but it is a proven succesful design with plenty of power under the hood.  I have absolutely no regrets with this purchase, the X220 is a great machine.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Hard Drive Size Issue!!!", "Author": "DFWScout", "ReviewID": "R34LD576ANTMTJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased my X220 from an individual locally.I think it is necessary to post this as a warning.I really like this laptop.

It is really well built and a great business notebook with docking and performance. The power to weight ratio is really there and it is a breeze to travel with especially since it has great battery life. However I really do not like the touch pad.

Dana", "ReviewID": "R2RKRWHZBBO22K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a Samsung Netbook with the Atom processor that was driving me nuts how slow it was. A good computer for $350, but too slow for my needs doing mostly internet browsing, the processor was always maxed out. This Thinkpad is so fast, much faster then my other 3 computers including a Dell, another older Thinkpad 400 and a HP desktop.For example, to load CNN.com on my old Samsung, it took about 7 seconds, this takes about 1 second. I have Comcast wireless with 50Mbps speed and I get 45Mbps download on this. The dual core processor is very fast for all tasks. The Thinkpad came loaded with Windows 7 Professional, since Im a new to Windows 7 (use Xp on other 3 computers) it has been a learning curve, but I am starting to like it. I found many ways to make it look and feel more like my XP so I am getting more comfortable.Back to the Thinkpad, there are some that criticize the trackpad. I found I had to customize it to stretch out the edge that it uses for detecting movement, that helped a lot as otherwise, I was finding errant selections to happen. It took me an hour or so to play around with the choices, but now it works great and is as good as any laptops pad. The keyboard is amazing also. I really like the light that you can turn on that illuminates the keyboard for working at night in low lights.As for battery, it probably does get about 7-9 hours, but I have the backlit contrast turned all the way up which reduces mine to about 6 hours, anything better then 4 I consider good anyways. As for the screen, it is amazing, so much better then my old netbook. The sound could be better, but I like the volume and on-off buttons on the keyboard that are dedicated to the sound. My old Netbook was a bit lighter, but this is still a notebook weight, but with a full laptop speed (minus a DVD drive), and more, believe me this is a screaming fast machine, amazaing is all I can say.I had some issues with my Symantec Internet Security not fully working, found out that I had to run Internet Explorer 9 in 32 bit mode, not 64, not an issue at all and a call to Symantec took me 2 minutes to change that. The PG UP and PG DN are at the top right, I like them on the lower right of the keyboard so I remapped two keys that are at the lower bottom to move forward and back on web pages, to now be the Pg UP and PG DN keys, it was a freeware program and I love now. The delete key is also in the upper right, but it is a double sized key so I like it now that I am used to it. When I am working and want to put it in sleep mode, I just press the on-off button and it goes right into sleep mode, pressing it again later, it comes back on within 5 seconds, then about 10 seconds more to reconnect to my wireless, very nice.If you want a Netbook sized and weight computer that is more powerful then most laptops and desktops, this is the computer. I did a ton of research and even though this is much more expensive, consider you are getting a full computer with a dual core processor. I ended up getting the 4Gb model and bought another 4Gb (8 total) from Crucial that took me less then 3 minutes to install. If you can afford the higher price, buy this, you won't be sorry as I am extatic about this little lightening fast computer.", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great machine if it works -- AWFUL Customer SUPPORT", "Author": "Paul L.

I had a minor problem easily resolved, by Lenovo support, but when I casually asked them to confirm my three-year warranty beginning in April 2012 when I purchased the laptop, their answer astonished and enraged me. Ocean Reef Electronics is not a Lenovo Business Partner so Lenovo will not honor the warranty - at all. When I confronted Ocean Reef Electronics about this problem, here's what they responded. And, since I found out only now, four months after buying the laptop, that Lenovo won't honor the warranty, I can't even buy one from Square Deal because you have to buy it within 90 days of purchasing the laptop. I am SOL.

This is well build, feels robust, fast and very light.However, I am very disappointed by the mouse pad. I was eager to play with the multi-touch. My girl friend has a MacBook Pro and her touch pad is just amazing with the multi-touch.Unfortunately, the multi-touch on the Lenovo is just garbage... For example with the 2 fingers scrolling, it is not responsive, doesn't do anything when I move slowly or scroll directly to the top/bottom of the page when I move just a little too fast. This is just unusable to me... This just amazes me to see Lenovo putting such an unfinished feature on the market... Thankfully I do not mind using the track point but I am very disappointed...

This is an amazing little laptop, so much power is so little space. If you like a big screen you'll hate it but I've had it for 6 months and while I mostly use it on trips I have no complaints. I bought the extended battery for really long trips in additional to having the standard battery for the shorter times away from the house. While many people complained about the touch pad and even I worried about it in the beginning I've gotten used to it and now adore it. Some of my pros and cons will depend on what specs you purchase but they will include my favorites even if they don't apply to your purchase.pros (there are too many to name...)- a usb 3.0 port- always on power usb capabilities- plenty of ports- textured touch pad- many different options for using the touch pad- thumb print reader- integrated mic and camera- plenty of space for wrists and curved/small form factor allows for comfortable resting space on whatever surface underneath- even though it's a small laptop the keyboard is still very manageable, granted I have small hands, I don't think someone with large hands could use it but I don't have any trouble- like all ThinkPads it's very sturdy, I actually dropped the thing not long after I got it (even though I've never once dropped a laptop) and while I did get a tiny split in the corner no internal damage was done- the little over screen light is convenient when you need to plug something in or see something while you are on a plane and trying not to disturb those around youcons- as all Lenovos are...the FN key is where the ctrl key should be, grr, I've gotten used to it but it's different from almost every keyboard in the world- it does have a very small screen but if you shell out the money for the nicer display it's worth it- should have gone all out and bought the SSD, I've heard it's completely amazing with this laptop; I'm more than happy with the hard drive in it but it would have been cool- some of my capabilities like the powered usb port was not enabled when I bought it, I figured all that would be on by default but I had to go into the bios and turn it on, no big deal just confused me- if you purchase the extended battery it doubles the weight of the little laptop- honestly...I know it's in the logo but why not option out the touch stick?So as you can tell, my cons are pretty silly and either opinionated or preference.

I've already tendered my return and have another with the standard display coming. Not only is the gorilla glass screen NOT touch-enabled (yes, this is a tablet! odd since the sales guy was so specific about the two vs. five finger thing) but the pen is extremely slick and very difficult to use -- you can't select anything long enough to drag, move, right click or, often, select. The damn pen tip keeps moving! I compared the pen \"feel\"  to my old x61 with the standard (touch) screen ... no problems with the pen, tracks and holds well. Finger is the bomb, selects anything.

I've owned over a dozen Thinkpads over the years. I use a T420 as my work machine, and this was going to be a game/movie/kid-safe machine. It has exactly the same CPU, memory and graphics as my T420, and the exact same keyboard and controls, which I really liked.However, this is the little machine that couldn't. I noticed right away that the screen was significantly dimmer than my T420, even with all the power settings maxed out. If I put the X220 on maximum brightness (15), it is the same as the T420 on level 11 or 12, in other words much dimmer and washed out. Same for the volume. Max volume (50) on the X220 is the same as around 30 on the T420. To be fair, the T420 has much larger speakers.But the real problem is the graphics. The X220, even with the second-generation I5 Core chip, just can't handle HD graphics. I tried it with Netflix, YouTube, and even Quicktime, and it stutters and chokes on all three. Even worse, when I play a child's game (nothing fancy), the four CPU's go to 90%, the fan shoots to high, and *really* hot air comes flying out of the vent.In short, this puppy really needs a graphics card. I had hoped that the Intel 3000 would be an improvement over the old 2000, but apparently not.Again, I really hated to send this guy back, but for almost $1000, I expected a machine that could zip through a Spongebob video without breaking a sweat.
