{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best budget notebook I've owned", "Author": "M. Bucci", "ReviewID": "R2T3VWX6UKOBZE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Having owned HP/Compaq notebooks for business (G6, CQ61, CQ62, NX series) for over seven years, I took the plunge out of HP into Lenovo and am very happy I did. Firstly, this notebook is a \"budget\" notebook, not a ThinkPad or Macbook Air, and should be compared with other budgets in its price range. It is ultra thin and very light. The 14-inch screen and the near-centered trackpad are best for my uses. Heat dissipation is excellent (no, it will not burn your legs while resting on your lap) and the unit is very quite. The keys are contoured to fit the fingers and require little pressure. The unit lacks a DVD drive but this is a direction taken by manufacturers to reduce weight and cost, and prepares the user for \"Cloud\" computing.Aesthetically, upon receiving the unit, I immediately compared it to my Macbook Pro of 2009: sleek, slim and thin but at (what seemed) half the weight. The screen detail and color fidelity are very good for a budget model. The sound quality is satisfactory (as in most notebooks), and whatever narrowness in frequency range exists, it is partially compensated for by a \"Dolby Advanced Audio\" 10-band equalizer. The single USB 3.0 port speeds data to and from my HP Pocket drive (with USB 3.0) at blazing speeds (unit has two USB 2.0 ports also); wireless sensitivity is above average; trackpad fluidity is close to a Macbook's (smooth!); 4GB of installed memory can be expanded to 8GB; and the HDMI port and 500GB hard drive are essential assets. (Note: A 500GB hard drive model will have 400GB available due to Lenovo using disk space as a \"recovery partition\".)I did not order a discontinued Lenovo Win 7 unit but leaped into Win 8 in December 2012 - \"culture shock!!!\" But . . . this is the future for the PC world and even we \"old timers\" must grow with the times. Win 8 is a \"work-in-progress\" for sure, and in order to adjust at a more relaxed pace to this OS, as well as get up-to-speed and \"productive\", I suggest downloading \"Classic Start Menu\" or \"Start 8\". These utilities will bring back the \"Start\" button and menu familiar to users of Win 7, Vista, XP, etc., but remove none of the features of Win 8.All in all, this Lenovo unit is well worth the money. Again, this is a budget notebook and is not a ThinkPad or Macbook Air, but to me it is top of the line of any budget notebook I've owned.Smooth, sleek, fast, compact, light . . . and very cool!", "Date": "January 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Great Inexpensive Laptop", "Author": "Roberttoo235", "ReviewID": "R25TKMRNC1OSPC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this computer for 2 weeks now. In that time I have come to realize just how sweet this little thing is. Obviously it is not a powerhouse for video editing or gaming, but for the normal online activities it is very good. I do keep the power setting on high, which seems to improve the speed of my web surfing. Windows 8 seemed daunting for the first couple hours, but it is so easy to customize and it boots up at such fantastic speeds. If you just need a competent little laptop that is inexpensive and has a great keyboard, but it now.", "Date": "February 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good little computer", "Author": "Rae \"Amateur Vagrant\"", "ReviewID": "R3BMNVX01FVU83", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good little computer. It's very slim and light. However, the graphics aren't great: everything has a bluish tint. Also, the mouse pad is just ridiculous. Most anywhere you click it, a menu pops up. You have to be very intentional about clicking it very near the bottom if you want to click and highlight text, for example. I would totally recommend this computer for any day-to-day activities, but I would also recommend getting a mouse. I haven't been using a mouse (I'll get one over the weekend), and frankly it's driving me quite nuts. But everything else is great--fast processor, lots of RAM, lots of memory...Windows 8 is fun, no complaints!", "Date": "April 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's ok, not fast, battery life is poor", "Author": "Mitchell Wells", "ReviewID": "RB1BB738FQIQ1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It is light weight and screen size is nice, but resolution is not fantastic. I would say the most annoying thing is the poor battery life, as I was hoping technology had improved.

I think it is a great compromise between cost and performance and a decent first laptop for any child or teenager (as long as they don't have hard-core gaming ambitions). The Radeon chip will be just fine for things like Minecraft. The GPU will use some of the RAM, but there is enough left to run 2 or 3 applications at the same time without swapping. Plenty of storage on the 500GB disk.So, overall a good purchase, but don't expect any miracles. It is in line with other $400 laptops in the marketplace today.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not what I expected", "Author": "Daniel Lachapelle", "ReviewID": "R2IIAWTYIM3ZTK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Probably my mistake, I thought this was basically the same as the S4 so I expected a touch screen but it is not. Starting from this disappointment did lead me not to appreciate the unit as much as I should. We had difficulty using it for Skype with bad image quality and echo with the sound.It is very light though and I love how portable it is. For the use we are making, the battery life is better than expected. The quality of the display is also disappointing, with fade colours and limited angle of view.", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00AM019DU"}}
