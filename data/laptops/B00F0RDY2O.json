{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Black plastic. Solid internals. Can run Linux beautifully!", "Author": "Brendan A. MacWade", "ReviewID": "RY3ZQ5ODAM4PX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The new ASUS X200CA with the Pentium \"Ivy Bridge\" processor is a great little performer. Costs were cut to be sure. It is black plastic. The battery is not replaceable. It a budget notebook rather than an entry level ultrabook. However, with a replaceable 2.5\" / 7mm high hard drive, it is no netbook, either. For those who want pretty good computing power on the cheap, it's a fine choice. Also, it's a great choice for anyone who ants to give Linux a spin without breaking the bank.So, it is plastic, but it's also light - just three pounds. The keyboard took only 15 minutes to master coming from the larger MacBook 13\". This is, essentially, a disposable laptop. It's something you use for 2-4 years and then resell or recycle. Battery life is a consistent 3-3.5 hours when fully charged, and with the brightness turned down a bit, and the device is not streaming video. The display is an LED lit 1366x768. Not nearly the best of what's available today, but it does support full 1080p resolution. The speakers are front firing, which is impressive at this price point. But like any laptop, headphones will provide the best possible audio quality.The screen is plastic, but seems scratch resistant. The touchscreen is very good - sensitive and responsive. Even if you install a Linux distribution, the touchscreen will still provide some functionality. I love the built in SD card reader. No more tethering my camera to my laptop to process and file photos.The last thing I need to get used to is the fan and heat vent on the left edge of the keyboard. It is easy to clean, says ASUS (with one of those Staples spray can dusters). The fan is no louder than the Apple fan. But it's right behind the vent, and it gets warm quickly. So I'm figuring out how to keep a better typing position and keep my left hand or from fingers away from the vent opening.This laptop makes the case that like tablets and phones, laptops are gadgets you use for two years and then move on to the next one. A lot of people use their MacBooks for two years, but I've had mine for nearly 5 years and it is built to last. The ASUS has a 64 bit Ivy Bridge processor. That's the latest and one of the best. It could go four years, but you'd have to take extra special care of it. Separate bag. No spills. No food. Go easy. This thing has what you need on the inside, but you need to be gentle with it.I have oily hands. The keyboard keys, thankfully, are oil and fingerprint proof. Unfortunately, the rest of the device isn't.. You might want to consider the metal finish version if you don't like fingerprints (the Q200). Fortunately, the laptop looks like new with a few circular wipes of a dry cloth or moist sponge. I do like the textured plastic and the wedge shape of the device. Just have to limit how much I touch that plastic. Stick to the keys and and a mouse (the cool ASUS blue ray optical mouse is a fine accessory for this).I trust ASUS. They make great monitors, components, and tablets. But clearly going from a MacBook to this is a step down in luxury. Sort of like going from a BMW to a Mazda. But Mazdas are still a lot of fun. If you want to get into Linux computing, this might be your perfect first vehicle to give it a spin.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Battery does not last 5 hours", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R36P29QODBJ1I4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "****Edit.  Down to one star.  Battery won't charge over 88% and just stops charging....saying 'plugged in not charging'.  At 88% it said I had three hours, got on the plane and it died in 35 minutes.  Oh and Windows 8 still is all bad.So  I will start with the negative.  I got this notebook this past weekend for a trip to Chicago for work.  I usually lug around a 15lb Dell laptop and just didn't want to this time.  The battery barely makes it three (3) hours, I actually chatted with Asus support yesterday and they confirmed that is normal.  Yet it says 5 hours in the description.  I am going to return it when I get home and try the ASUS VivoBook X202E-DH31T 11.6-Inch Touch Laptop.I can also hear the hard drive at times like it's working really hard to just browse the web.Dislike Windows 8, but that has nothing to do with the notebook.Positives:Screen is great when I watched a movie, very clear.  A little glare.Touchscreen is nice too, very responsive.Keyboard takes some getting used to so small, but once used to the size it's good.So much nicer to carry for work than my giant Dell", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good computer for the money", "Author": "Solitude Seeker", "ReviewID": "R156B8J6MVUT51", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm really very happy with this computer except for the battery life.  After reading many reviews of the ASUS notebook computers that detailed the pitiful battery life, I went with this one, hoping the stated 5 hour battery life would really be four.  It is not -- I get about 3 hours from the battery.  Considering the ASUS netbook I owned 5 years ago had a 7-8 hour battery life, I find this really pitiful.The computer works medium-fast running Win 8.1 with Classic Shell to mimic Windows 7.  I'm just not ready to learn the \"Metro\" side of it yet.  The touch screen is fairly sensitive, but not as good as my Acer android tablet.The main problem I have, besides the battery life, is the inability to register the computer with ASUS.  When I try to register, I get the message my password isn't correct, but when I click on \"forgot password\" the window that pops up is too short for me see the CAPTCHA code, so I can't get past it.  Tech support was less than useless as the only solution was for me to register under a different e-mail address, which is not acceptable to me.  I'd attempted to reach ASUS through e-mail, but the e-mail address bounces.", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great value for the price", "Author": "Carlos", "ReviewID": "RCO56GII7Q7BJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this on sale last year close to the holidays and, after a few minor tweaks, am very pleased.Was on a very tight budget after losing my job at the time and bought it to replace a 2006 Macbook Pro(2.16ghz dualcore, 4gb, ATI x1600) that finally gave up (overheating issues). it's surpassed my expectations so much that I dropped my initial plan of using this for a while then buying a more powerful laptop when money allowed.The good* It's speedy and boot up is ridiculous, even without an SSD hard drive you're up in seconds as if you had one and everything is very snappy.  Even months later with the drives filled with tons of stuff I have no speed complaints.* Everything I throw at it runs well: multitasking, web (many tabs and flash heavy sites), work, video and, to my surprise, games (Source engine games like CS: Source run great, and Warframe [a modern graphically demanding game] runs surprisingly well [40+fps] on low settings + lighting/bloom/mid textures.  Some, like Natural Selection 2, are just unplayable even on low).* The touch screen works perfectly, but I find myself using it less and less after fixing the touchpad (more below). I sometimes use it on the start menu and all the time for the picture password.* Asus USB Charger Plus which supposedly turbocharges iPhones/pads.* SmartAudio for the system wide equalizer [you will want it to lower the bass and boost the treble on the built in speakers or else music sounds deep/drowned as well as to get more bass when using headphones.  Thankfully, there are separate settings for speakers and headphones and the system will smartly switch on plugging/unplugging headhphones, Even volume level, just like my old Mac. neat]* Fantastic travel and tactile feel of the keyboard and perhaps the best placement of home/end, PageUp/PageDown I've ever seen [on the left/right and Up/Down arrow keys used while holding the Fn key.  Just makes so much sense.  I have to hunt for the End key on my work Dell when I want to go to end of line.]* The screen is really bright and colorful.* Feels great/looks great2mo+ Update:I've started using this machine with VMware Workstation 10 to script and code in CentOS 6.4 and the latest version of a certain fruit based OS.  Not sure what the 1 star reviewers are doing, but I'm still impressed this little processor packs such a punch.  I'm giving the virtual machines 2GB of ram, access to both CPU cores, and storing files on their own partitions.  Animations are slightly choppy in the VM, of course, because of no driver support, and disk access is a little bit slower, but everything's rendered well and fairly responsive for a 1.8ghz dual core.  I wanted native-type speed and now boot directly into said fruit based OS from an external usb.  Even without graphics acceleration it runs so smooth you wouldn't believe you weren't on an all aluminum and glass machine.The bad* The camera frame rate is really low.  Like old school 2megapixel low, while the resolution is decent.* The stock Asus touchpad driver this comes with has a pretty, apple-like UI, but is absolute garbage.  A ton of misclicks and cursor jittering, especially when navigating the start menu.  Without fail, u will open the photo app or the store, etc.  Pretty annoying.  Worse is there is no real way to tweak sensitivity or fine tune behavior in the default control panel and it seems there is a conflict between the 32 bit and 64 bit drivers that run simultaneously. (I found that renaming the 32 bit driver folder to avoid it starting up helped a ton with the misclicks while navigating the start menu, but not enough)* The screen is glossy.  Feels great to the touch, but sometimes depending on where I am the ceiling light or my own reflection can be distracting.  But that's a problem with all glossy screens* Battery life is more like 3 hours, but then again I have a lot of things running on it.* Matte keys and grey labeling makes them hard to see when working in the dark.* The touchpad is two to maybe three times more firm to click than say, an apple touchpad.  Like the apple pad, it's hinged at the top so pushing there is much harder than the middle, which is harder than the bottom.  You get used to it though and then those other pads feel way too squishy.* The screen color temperature varies a quite bit depending on the vertical angle u look at it.  I can go from about 4300k to 5000k in like an inch and a half of tilt.  More noticeable than my old mac.Recommendations if you're sticking with Windows 81. Install system-wide malware blockingsee winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.htm for instructions or just get the list is at winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.txt. It goes in C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts and will provide you stress free browsing in all apps including IE, which doesn't really have a suitable malware blocking extension.2. and the biggest recommendation, install better touchpad driversI've tried a few different ones and you're best bet is: elan_touchpad-11.14.5.2(www.station-drivers.com).exe  Not only does the control panel have more options, you can enable even more hidden options in the registry under Computer\\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Elantech\\SmartPad.  Misclicks... gone.. Jittering gone.  I can now rest my thumb on the bottom right to click and use my index finger to move. I like the apple touchpad experience and here is how I've tweaked mine.. impossible with the stock Asus driversAnywhere I click or tap is a left click, even the bottom rightTwo finger click or tap is a right clickTwo finger reverse \"natural\" panning/scrollThree finger click or tap is a middle clickThree finger swipes left/right to go forward/backThree finger swipe up opens My ComputerThree finger swipe down does ctrl alt tab, one finger swipe/click to select an appand of course you have your standard pinch zoom, one finger swipe from edge to open Charms bar etc.Minor quirksThe experience isn't completely perfect though.  Very rarely when switching from speaker to headphones and vice versa, the speaker balance goes out of whack and will be 60/40 or 75/25 and I'll be wondering why one side sounds louder.  I have to open SmartAudio to set it back to 50/50.  Also, the touchpad will stop responding for some reason.  It can be recovered by clicking down on it once or twice somewhere in the middle-left region.  Again, these happen so infrequently, and could just be my machine, that I have not bothered to try to figure out why they happen as it's a quick fix and back to whatever I was doing.", "Date": "May 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Low cost laptop for work, that's all", "Author": "bjh", "ReviewID": "R2SF5SAK99VWQV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just got it two days ago.I guess because I don't have any expectation for this one at this price, so its performance is  better than I expected.I got a heavier i7 laptop at home and I need a lighter work horse for daily lab work, so I choose this one.Pro: cheap, OK for office/internet.Con: you cannot expect a very great performance.
