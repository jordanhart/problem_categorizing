{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Gaming!", "Author": "Trajan", "ReviewID": "RQQ7XCMB7XQYS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop after careful research online.  I was looking at an Alienware but there was no way I was going to get the specs this ASUS ROG has for anywhere near the price.  I have been playing Guild Wars 2(GW2) on it and the ROG G750 screams; I was fighting a world boss and their were easily over 60 people fighting it, my game graphics were set to high setting and I experienced zero lag spikes (it could easily handle the ultra settings, but I just don't like to push my graphic cards more than I need to).  On Warcraft I set my graphics to ultra to bring down the FPS some it was running on high setting with 170FPS.  The ROG 750 runs super cool I have done some serious gaming and tried to push it to get it to heat up but the most I have been able to do is get the edge of the keyboard up by the monitor luke-warm and the exhaust about the same, the portion by the touch-pad where your palms rest stayed almost chilly ( I am running a laptop cooler under it but i'm not sure its needed).  The only thing I didn't really like is the windows 8.1 OS, 8.1 is app based like a smartphone and made mostly for a touch screen. there is no traditional start button or menu like other Windows OS, this was easily fixed by downloading a program called \"Classic-shell\" it added a more traditional Windows start menu and start button, this made the 8.1 OS more tolerable. The ROG750 being a gaming laptop is larger and heavier than a regular laptop (which I don't mind because I love the 17.3-inch screen), the style is really nice the exterior seems to have a black rubberized Mat finish on it-Hurray for no fingerprints! the keyboard is led backlit it's only a white light but I really dont need all the colored lights it's competitors offer, it has a rather large touchpad with is kind of odd because most gamers I know would disable it and use a mouse (which I did). overall the 750 is fast, runs really cool, seems really durable and it's stylish. If you want a great gaming laptop at a fair price you might seriously consider the ROG 750JS.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "An absolute champ", "Author": "Anthony", "ReviewID": "R1IB7W5GHJT2AF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop boasts unrivaled performance, and at a price point this high it better be. ASUS 100% delivers on this and gives the user an amazing experience. The 3.4gHz Intel i7 and the NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX 870M provides absolutely stellar gaming performance. I've had zero problem running all my games (Team Fortress 2, Saints Row 4, Skyrim) on maximum settings. I've even been able to mod Skyrim to the point that it looks like this [...]Thanks to the 16gb of memory, this machine also performs really well in editing programs, which are able to actually utilize the full 16gb of memory as opposed to most gamesIt is truly amazing what this machine is capable of.PROS:* Stellar gaming performance on ULTRA settings* Fast, and I mean FAST booting and program launching for anything installed on the 256gb SSD* Mass storage (on a still fast) 1TB HDD* Versatility in both gaming and editing* Large HD, anti-glare screenCONS:* HEAVY. This is a 10 lb laptop, while 10 lbs might not be the worst burden to bare, it will feel immensely heavy the first week or so you have it if you recently owned a laptop weighing 5 lbs or less* Short battery life* Uncomfortable at times (more on that later)A LITTLE MORE DETAIL:This laptop also comes with some very useful features, such as the Asus GPU Tweak program, offering an optional 5% GPU overclock when the laptop is plugged in.**Note, In order to play a game like Skyrim modded as heavily as mine and have a decent fps, you 100% MUST have the laptop plugged in with GPU Tweak activated**The GeForce Experience program also makes optimizing your games a flash as Nvidia automatically can apply the best settings for you, as well as offering features such as ShadowPlay and live streaming straight to Twitch.tv, making recording and streaming games incredibly easy.As for the uncomfortablility of the product, you will most likely only experience this if you use a laptop, well, on your lap. For me at least, the edge of the laptop pushes a bit into my left wrist while I have my hands on the keyboard, which is tolerable but a bit annoying. A tiny padding there resolves the issue. Another uncomfortablility factor, heat. If you're running an intensive game and have this on your lap, the area near the back vents get VERY HOT and can be quite uncomfortable. However for the most part this cooling solution is incredibly efficient and keeps you and your delicate components cool.SUMMARY:This laptop will provide excellent gaming/editing performance, as would be expected for a laptop this price. One thing to note, this laptop might not be for you. In fact, a laptop at all might not be the solution for you. If you do not plan on taking your computer anywhere that often then you absolutely, ABSOLUTELY build your own computer. I can 100% guarantee you can build a better gaming computer yourself for $2000. HOWEVER, if portability and an ultimate gaming experience is a must for you, then I have no higher recommendation than this laptop", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent Work/Gaming Computer", "Author": "Justin Little", "ReviewID": "R3IOY7NZIDNXWS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Main usage of this product:Animating/rendering in Maya 2014. Video editing. Gaming.Pros:1) Performance - With a nice sized SSD, dedicated GTX 870M with overclocking, seperate CPU and GPU dual rear-vented fans, and the i7 with plenty of memory, this machine is a beast. I've used it to animate and render in Autodesk Maya 2014 with no overheating or performance problems. Same goes for gaming. It runs any game in high/ultra setting that I throw at it with ease (ie, Skyrim, World of Warcraft, Farcry 3, just to name a few).2) Cooling - This computer has the absolute best cooling I've ever seen in a laptop. The CPU and GPU have their own rear-blowing fan that does a great job at keeping it cool. It will get slightly warm after a few hours of use, but only if you're really testing out the hardware (ie, rendering in Maya, running Skyrim with mods in the highest possible setting), even then, it's the most heat efficient laptop I've used.3) The list of pros could go on and on and on. Pretty much every aspect of this laptop feels great for a Game developer/video editor/gamer like myself.Cons:1) Battery Life - Let's admit it, you won't be buying this laptop for the battery efficiency.2) Heavy - at 9.9 pounds, it's one hefty mobile computer.3) Finding a backpack/computer case that fits it - At first, I bought a 17.3 inch case that didn't quite fit the dimensions. Make sure you find one that fits. (Dimensions ((WxHxD)) - 16.1 x 2.0 x 12.5\" / 40.9 x 5.1 x 31.8 cm)4) Windows 8.1 - Though I recently read that Microsoft is planning on releasing a patch in the future that will make this OS feel a bit more like Windows 7. This is good since the computer doesn't have a touch screen, and Windows 8.1 is pretty annoying.Overall, I'd recommend this product to anyone that's looking for a powerful laptop that can easily support the high-spec demands of gamers, gaming development, and video editing professionals alike.", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "so far...awesomeness", "Author": "Carl D.

After purchasing this sucker, every game I had problems with were no longer problematic. This BEAST blew them out of the water. WoW on MAX settings. Elder Scrolls Online at MAX settings. Start up time is under 10 seconds. I mean i could just keep going on and on. ITS AWESOME!-Here's the nitty gritty.Three things that I wouldnt say i dislike but is an inconvenience.(1) The over 1TB of Harddrive space is partitioned into 2x 500g drives and 2x 100g drives. So when you install larger games you have to choose a different drive than your C drive as most of its space is taken up with initial program files and the OS itself.(2) Screen is 17.3\" however DO NOT USE THIS MEASUREMENT for buying a carrying case. Once you add in the stylish designs that border the screen; the computer ends up being a large 18\"+ size computer. I had to purchase an 18\" carrying bag before it would fit. (And even then it was a tight fit...)(3)  Windows 8... Not sure who's idea it was to start incorporating a Mobile Phone based OS on PCs, but they should be fired. Takes about a week of use before you get used to the cool little options Windows 8 has to offer. Also takes about a week before you remember how to get to programs and files because they are located in a vastly different location then the previous OS. But this is just the OS, if you don't like it, buy Windows 7 and install it...  I got used to it, now I love Windows 8.Like I said those 3 \"complaints\" weren't really complaints and this computer is amazing.

I use it for video editing and so far it's been awesome.  I plan on maxing out the RAM to 32g soon.  Love the idea of having something I can keep updating for years to come.  For video editing I needed a few things which this computer came with: i7 processor, 7200 RPM Hard Drive, at least a TB, at least 2g graphic card and at least 16g of RAM.  This had it all with extras.  Again I can add larger hard drives over time which I'll eventually replace the spinning drives with TB's SSD's. Waiting on the price to go down some more.  Having the Thunderbolt and all 3.0 USB's was huge.  I transfer a lot of data at times and this has made my life so much nicer.  The price was a little stiff but for what you get and being able to keep updating for years to come was worth it.  I haven't ran into an issue other than having to order a large carrying bag for this.  It's impossible to locate one locally so you probably will have to order one and make sure it's for a 18\" because of the thickness this one will not fit 17\" ones.", "Date": "May 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "I do love it but, in an imperfect world, there are always caveats...", "Author": "audiamondag", "ReviewID": "RFT3LJTX701D0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered mine on Saturday, May 3, 2014 and received it Wednesday, May 7, 2014 via Amazon Prime.  I've found little that is not to like. I'm in agreement with all the praise in many other reviews. Finding it featured recently by \"Maximum PC\" magazine helped my buy decision.Five comments so far:1) Having to buy a Windows 8.1 laptop without a touch screen is a major disappointment for me. I haven't been able to find any 17.3\" laptop with a touch screen. I'd rate this machine 6 out of 5 if it had a touch screen.2) My wrist hairs are getting caught in the joint where the top meets the base/sides.  I've had many laptops and this is the first one with that problem.3) I've got a Solid State Drive on my desktop and I am totally hooked on SSDs.  This machine reboots and loads programs FAST.4) The touch pad is the best I've used.  It has a good control panel with lots of configuribility. You can have it optionally disable when a mouse is attached.5) ASUS has not installed a bunch of junkware that I had to uninstall.  Thank you ASUS.  I've got four ASUS HD monitors, a router and now this laptop. All seem to be of top rate quality and have had no problems so far.

I am amazed at the quality and design of this laptop. It boots in seconds, and opens applications in the blink of an eye. It's very sturdy, and the screen looks great. The backlit keyboard is very handy for working in dark environments. It would be an excellent laptop for gaming, but my primary uses are video editing and audio recording. I need to do multi-camera editing, and my old laptop simply could not keep up. With this computer, video editing is smooth and easy. Rendering is much faster, too. I have been dabbling in game development, and found that my old laptop would overheat and shut down within 15 minutes of using the Unreal UDK. Needless to say, this laptop is able to run game development software flawlessly. In fact, I rarely hear the fan. It's amazingly cool and quiet. It comes with software to overclock the GPU, but I haven't had a need for that yet.

They will not tell me if I have to pay shipping or not, I guess that's the crackerjack surprise I'll get at the UPS store.What is really pissing me off is that they will not extend the warranty for the time they have the unit.  If they keep it for a month its just a month of warranty gone.  Their 'reason' given was that customers would just fake issues to keep sending in products to extend the warranty.Think about that for a minute.

With the OS on the SSD, it boots in less than 5 seconds and will do a complete restart in less than 8 seconds.I just upgraded the memory to 32GB, and it only took me about 45 seconds to insert the 2 additional 8 GB memory modules.  There are 2 dimms available for adding additional memory directly under the back cover.  Remove one screw and take the back off and it takes about 30 seconds to insert the 2 additional memory modules.  I used Patriot Viper for an additional 16GB.  It cost me about $180.00 at Amazon or Fry's Electronics.I purchased this laptop to replace an ASUS G73JH laptop I purchased several years ago and I couldn't be happier!!  This laptop screams with speed and it didn't really need the additional 16GB of memory, I just thought I'd put it out there in the event I needed it at some point.Great laptop and I couldn't be happier with it.  This is undoubtedly the best laptop I've ever owned and it has functioned flawlessly since I purchased it last week.  I highly recommend the G750JS since it has the 1TB HDD @ 7200 RPM and the 256GB SSD.  I had $600 in credits from my Chase Sapphire card and it dropped the price down to just over $1400 with a Square Trade 4 year extended warranty.The NVidia GTX870M Graphics card is incredible and I have already tried out the Thunderbolt connections, external Blu-Ray writer (ASUS) connected via the USB3.0 (4 ports), the speed is incredible.

As usual, ordering, shipping and delivery using Amazon Prime was a great experience.  BUT, when I unpacked and fired up this laptop, i was literally swamped with MALWARE.  I immediately thought it was due to ASUS loading up all this junk.  After an hour and a half of uninstalling malware only to find that it was reinstalled on reboot, I decided to call ASUS support.Paul from ASUS listened to me gripe and boy did I.  Then he asked me to tell him what \"malware\" I was seeing, and upon my reading the list to him, he stated that ASUS does not install any of these programs.  He asked if I had bought a NEW or USED laptop and I told him that Amazon (I purchased directly through Amazon, not a 3rd party) sold me a NEW laptop.  He questioned that since the laptop had all this malware on it and now I do to.Amazon, I'm going to reach out to you and allow you to defend yourself here because I have had nothing but great experiences using Prime and purchasing from you.  BUT, if I find that you sold me a USED laptop while stating NEW, I will file with the FCC against you.  I paid a LOT of money for this laptop and don't like being swindled if that is the case.Now, about the laptop...THIS THING ROCKS!  I play World of Tanks, which is a very intensive MMO.  I had a crummy HP with built in video card and was only able to get up to 15 FPS on minimum settings.  I just played at MAXIMUM settings, which render gorgeous graphics at 80 FPS...a truly seamless gaming experience.  The sound from this thing is great as well and the display is awesome and clear.  I have a cooling pad coming tomorrow and I know I'll need it since this thing does put out some serious heat...the back fans seem to be handling it fine, but I don't want to take any chances. When I was playing the game it was blowing very hot air...now it's very cool...so you know that graphics card is the culprit as expected.This thing is also a brick...I mean, it's very heavy, but I don't care as I'm not going to tote it around.

I have seen many cheap and funny looking  power buttons but this beats them all....I wonder why ASUS would use Hyndai Electronics RAM?And another thing that got my attention is that when my camera was detected with skype was recognized as: USB2.0HD UVC WebCam", "Date": "May 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Dead Pixels on a 1750 dollar gaming computer", "Author": "eric mcgraw", "ReviewID": "R140BGEFUABVM5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The machine was to replace another ASUS ROG which has been a stellar performer for over five years. I like the brand. Except for the major issue which I believe was caused by poor shipping/boxing of the item and the incompetence of the mail handling company I think its great. Fast boot up, crisp graphics. Needless to say, I was very disappointed to get this machine from Amazon. Not at first mind you, but after I started loading software. I loaded Word and noted that against the white background there was a \"j\" of dead pixels I failed to note earlier against the black/grey ASUS factory installed wallpaper. After dropping 1750 USD on this baby there is no way I am going to settle for a machine with dead pixels from jump street. I sent Amazon an email and they sent me not one but two (2) of these exact machines. The one I accepted had dead pixels in different spots and a loose connection from the board to the screen which caused the image to flicker. I believe this happened because these were poorly packed to prevent shock.After emailing my concerns about the first one Amazon sent me two replacement machines instead of the one I asked for. To be clear I accepted delivery on only one.  This one had with the least damage to its outer shipping box. This was after I had to re-box and ship at my own expense the initial defective unit.I think these morons at UPS don't realize that they can't sling these packages around the truck like a canned ham. At the final tally two out of the three boxes were damaged on arrival. Note to self. Do not mail order delicate electronics with this company. Amazon does not know how to box a computer and it has cost me a lot of time and treasure due to their (and UPS's) incompetence.The return process for Amazon is a pain. There is nobody available to fix a problem (like stopping a duplicate shipment) and its been a hassle to ship these back to them without prepaid postage. Allegedly, I will get reimbursed in the end. I sent one computer back already and it should have arrived yesterday. However I am not getting credit for it to my account. I recommend that since Amazon can't pack laptops worth a @#$% and UPS flings them around like Frisbees go to an electronics store.  There you can complain to a person if you are presented a broken computer and not have to wait for days for a replacement. Using Amazon you can drive your butt down to the city UPS store and pick up your item late at night. Its simple UPS, a lot of people work till 5 and yet you want to deliver to a residence at 1. The driver wants to be back at the barn by 6:30 or 7pm. Yeah its like the cable guy. UPS is never there when you are available to receive a package you have to sign for. I got an idea, how about sending the expensive residential deliveries out later dimwits? This business model and customer service leaves a lot to be desired!
