As an IT guy with nearly 10 years of experience, this little guy is well worth the investment.  What I like most are the keys.  I normally type 60+ wpm but the way that the keys are designed, it seems like its 70+.  Very ergonomic.  Battery life is great and with the amount of RAM the performance is exceptional.  Very slick look!  Highly recommended.", "Date": "June 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "The hinges are  PROBLEM!", "Author": "Marva V. Curtis", "ReviewID": "R17T2V4TN375E5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The price was so right! I bought this computer recently and it is a work horse, I love all of the things it can do. My problem is the design of the screen, it cannot open all the way which drives me nuts. The screen stands vertical, not good. Frequent pushing on the screen will damage the machine eventually, other laptops that I own, open like a book, not this one, it barely opens half way. Other than that it would have been just what I needed so I'm returning it.", "Date": "June 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "It does its job", "Author": "Giselle Bobo Morales \"Proud Mommy\"", "ReviewID": "R1CGIHTTTXSUS1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i purchased this from best buy back in may 2009, it's nothing special but if you need a laptop that will do its job, this is one i'd recommend. it's just hard to keep it clean since the keyboard is of a glossy finish. i use it daily and definitely enjoy it!", "Date": "October 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Decent laptop, but if you have any issues, you're on your own - would not recommend.", "Author": "N. Vermont", "ReviewID": "R1GVKZYUJI6VM4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Bought two of these at the same time.  Didn't move them around much; his was mostly used to read the newspaper in the morning, check email, and watch an occasional movie, and mine was used to check email and fiddle around with Photoshop here and there.  We also both use Skype once in awhile; the camera quality wasn't good, but it did the job.  Both worked well for awhile - the keyboard is easy to type on, the harmon/kardon speakers are a nice touch, and no complaints in general.  Just over a year in, his camera stopped working; technical support said they couldn't do anything about it and were generally unhelpful.  About a year and a half in, my computer's screen started flickering/flashing once every ten seconds or so.  If turned off for a day or two, it would be fine again for awhile.  Again, technical support was completely unhelpful.  But this is the reason I would not buy a Toshiba product again: my power cord died two weeks ago, and his died one week ago.  They died within a week of each other!  We have no pets who could chew wires, don't move the laptops around much, and shut the power on the power strip at night / when we're not around.  I called Toshiba's technical AND customer support and asked if they would replace these, as they seem to be lemons.  Both were polite enough, but refused to help in any way, and could not offer anything- no replacements, no discounts, nothing.  I will absolutely not shell out $140 for two new power cords when these two died after two years; my last power cord lasted almost seven years.  I know generic replacements are available for pretty cheap, but it was more the principle that incensed me.  So much for standing behind your products.  I would not recommend the laptops and would not recommend Toshiba products unless you buy with the knowledge that you are on your own once your warranty expires.", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "the window", "Author": "cynthia cravens", "ReviewID": "R2IA9G0HWUFVD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "it is not the window it said it was in it and the windows that is in it is not a genuine windows and i am not happy i was happy with it when i got it but that keep on pooping up", "Date": "May 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great deal!", "Author": "Texas Santa", "ReviewID": "R3J6VP53M99GH3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent endless hours looking for the best rated laptop for college.
