The ultrabook is very thin although little heavy (due to glass screen). Connected to my existing router in a snap and after about 30 mins of Windows 8 update it worked flawlessly. The display is crisp though not full HD. The battery life is quite good and I am able to get about 4.5 hours consistently.  The touchscreen is very responsive and very user friendly once you get used to it. The performance is very good. I purchased external DVD-RW add on for a small price. Overall an excellent laptop!Update 11/21: I recently updated from Windows 8 to 8.1 and like it much better. The touch screen is even more responsive with the upgrade and boot up time is really quick. So far no issues after using it for about 4 months, I use it everyday for about 4-6 hours. I recently upgraded my router to Netgear-750 which supports 802.11n. I am unable to get this laptop to connect using 5Ghz/801.11n but it is not a major issue.", "Date": "August 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Keyboard is horrible", "Author": "Joseph Barrett", "ReviewID": "R1UH8DJG9E2713", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The feel and functionality of this keyboard is awful.

The design is very beautiful. this laptop is thin and light. You can bring it everywhere, sometime I carry it on the bed. The system is strong. you can run games and every normal programs.

I recommend it for school use and surfing the web since it is very light making it portable.", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing ultrabook for the price.", "Author": "R. RAMIREZ \"all-around IT dude\"", "ReviewID": "R39M1KWVXC3454", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am an information technology professional who relies on ASUS products. This ultrabook runs smoothly, boots up super fast, it has a responsive touch screen and is very light. I had a big and bulky Toshiba Qosmio desktop replacement laptop that weighed about 19 pounds. I gave it to my sister and decided to upgrade to a current laptop. The ASUS VivoBook V500 seemed like the obvious choice for me.Windows 8 runs super fast on the machine. The 15\" HD screen is super sharp and easy on the eyes. The chiclet keyboard is very comfortable for typing.If you are looking for a nice ultrabook, I recommend you this one.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "DOA - New one on the way! - Will Update later", "Author": "David Hahn", "ReviewID": "RZQ9ZS0U9GM8M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "UPDATE 3:  ASUS took 3 weeks to get me a replacement laptop.  The replacement laptop is fine, I am just disappointed with the service after the sale.UPDATE 2:  ASUS service is SLOOOOWWWW.  The paid for the shipping (ground) 5 days to ship to Calif. service depot, 6 days in repair, 5-6 days to get it back to me (Expected delivery date is 10/9/2013).  If speedy service after the sale is important to you, I would look elsewhere.  I wish I would have purchased a different brand now.  I purchased the laptop on 9/19, by the time it will get here it will be almost a month since I purchased it and I have not even got to use it.UPDATE:  Between ASUS and AMAZON the situation is being resolved.  ASUS is going to replace the laptop, hopefully this was an isolated incident!Item crashed when you press the up arrow. Space bar is unresponsive, the 2 and q keys stick.  Amazons return policy sucks.  As I am a full time student I am now without a computer and must rely on the computer lab at the school to complete my homework.  The experience has been a total fail.  Will never buy an electronic item from AMAZON unless something is done to win me back. Dealing with the manufacturer to rectify the problem since AMAZON was absolutely no help.", "Date": "September 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Design is nice, but built with faulty wireless card making this useless for remote work access", "Author": "michael a ell", "ReviewID": "R3IKTEV8AA4M12", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "ASUS is a great brand.  Have used a variety of their products for years.  I love everything about this but the wireless card.  It constantly drops the signal, causing me to lose emails, downloads and other web based information. I've tried about 12 different wireless networks too.  Always the same. I'll be surprised if this actually posts the first time without copying the paragraph, then logging back in and posting it. I've only had this for about 70 days.

I've owned this laptop for a week and love it.  First, this is no small laptop.  The 15.6 inch screen makes for a wide laptop, but, it is thin enough and light enough to make it easily portable.  I was a little concerned about this laptop's lack of cd/dvd drive.  Many laptops in this price range are leaving these drives out, so it just takes some getting used to.  Many software developers give you the option to download via digital distribution, so I don't think this will be an issue.  Plus, USB flash drives are very cheap (32 gigs for $20), so if you have trouble transferring files within a network, there's a cheap solution.  As far as the OS is concerned, Windows 8 seems like a good, stable operating system. I still don't like not having a start menu, but I found a few workarounds to give me my old start menu back.  As for the keyboard, I suppose the negative reviewers received faulty keyboards, but mine seems fine.  My only complaint regarding the keyboard is that the keys aren't crisp, and the keyboard is not backlit.  I'm not too bothered by this, considering the price.  Typing is fast and responsive.  Overall, this seems like a solid laptop, especially for the price.  Only time will tell regarding it's durability and reliability, but I've owned plenty of Asus products and have high expectations.", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great laptop, great price", "Author": "Kevin", "ReviewID": "R18ZBN626OV0BG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My son wanted a laptop with windows 8 which I feel is a better experience with a touch screen.  The I5 processor is very fast.  Start-up time is fabulous and the computer arrived in almost perfect condition.  Things i don't like about the laptop is the sound (it's a little tinny) and I can't get used to the keyboard as it just doesn't feel right.  Overall I am very satisfied.

Casual, web browsing, email, facebook, etc. Not a gaming rig by any means, but for someone who isn't planning on using it for anything resource intensive, this system was great for the price. Solid construction, good battery life, and a very responsive touch screen. Bloatware isn't terrible, so if you know anything about windows, you can pretty quickly go through and uninstall the things that aren't needed. Screen resolution was good, and weight of the laptop feels light for a laptop of this size. Would recommend for non power users.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great laptop and easy to upgrade", "Author": "John S", "ReviewID": "RG79QK7RH9MBF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop replaced my Dell XPS 15 which had a first generation Intel core I7 cpu. The Dell lasted me 3 years before the charger over heated and fried the motherboard. Lucky for me my SSD hard drive survived. I received this laptop and booted it up to verify operation, then I swapped out was the supplied hard drive with the Kingston SSD that was in my Dell. I also upgraded the 2GB memory with a 4GB Crucial SODIMM. For extra storage I added a Crucial M500 120GB mSATA Internal Solid State Drive CT120M500SSD3 into the empty MSATA slot. Keep in mind that this slot was meant for a mini or half size SSD, so in order to make it fit, I had to remove the standoff off of the motherboard. This took a little bit of effort since the standoff is encased in plastic. Keep in mind that this will void your warranty and I only recommend doing this if you know what you are doing. Their was no way to secure this SSD, but it was a tight enough fit so I wasn't worried. Another option if you chose would be to just get a min SSD like this one 128GB mSATA Mini Half SATAIII After I made these upgrades I wiped the main drive and re installed Win 8. Later I also upgraded the wifi to a Bigfoot Networks KillerN-1202 Notebook Wireless Card. Keep in mind that the supplied wifi card doesn't support 5ghz networks and that was a feature that I wanted. Overall this laptop is very well made and very easy to add upgrades to. I like that it stays much cooler then my old Dell XPS and, for $500 not counting my upgrades you can't beat it.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Simply Awesome", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R1M60TJOFXDCH3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed a new laptop for school. I just started university and I am taking all my courses online, I had an old laptop that I installed the customer preview edition of windows 8 and I loved it so much, it was only the beta version which I downloaded from Microsoft for fee but I loved it. My only problem was my old laptop is some 6 yrs old and was not touch screen... so with that being said, with the touch screen, windows 8, super fast boot (10 sec) simply awesome.Just a caution: If you have not used windows 8 before, It will take some time for the newbie to get used to it.

I have had the computer for 6 months and the Keyboard is lifting up so you cant hit the keys, I bought another keyboard just to use the computer. The mouse pad is so sensitive that if you even just brush it, the mouse will click somewhere else. I have not used the actual attached keyboard and mouse for 4 months because the keyboard lifted up. When I try to type I always brush the mouse pad and all the windows 8 screen start popping up or I am clicking into a different window, you cannot deactivate the mouse pad to only allow clicking the right and left mouse buttons.
