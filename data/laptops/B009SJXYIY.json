The speed of the processor is amazing. I also love the addition of a Blue-Ray player with a graphics card to match.  Great for gaming and watching videos on Netflix and YouTube.  Totally worth the extra money.  Highly recommend and I couldn't be happier.  The only thing it didn't have was Microsoft office which I needed for my college coursework, but I easily downloaded that on the computer and had to pay like $75 for the really good version.", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$2,099.99", "Features": "Intel Core i7 3720QM 2.6 GHz\n16 GB DDR3\n1000 GB 5200 rpm Hard Drive\n17.3-Inch Screen, NVIDIA GeForce GTX675M\nWindows 8 Professional, 6-hour battery life", "Name": "CybertronPC Boss NB3172A 17.3-Inch Laptop", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41wkbIMKK1L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009SJXYIY"}}
