{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent computer, almost no compromises.", "Author": "Joerg von Loebenstein", "ReviewID": "R2TVTT6S75YR3P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a sturdy, fast, dependable, neat professional computer with very few compromises.I get 4 solid hours of battery life while working with large files in graphics programs and connected to the internet all the time. This is how I measure battery life. Measurements with dim brightness and doing almost nothing are nonsense to me.The keyboard layout, tactile feel, touchpad and peripheral ports are all well laid out, strong and functional. Every component works great. The computer creates almost no noise and very little heat after you update the BIOS.Strongest characteristic is that I have used it intensively for 3 months and it has never crashed. The outside appearance is still top notch, thanks to the great quality metal finish all over, with no cheap plastic that starts scratching or disassembling after a few weeks.People tend to look at it and ask the brand name and model, because its clean aesthetics stand out in a world of laptops full of snazzy motives and funny useless gadgets and gizmos.I only have 3 complaints:- The trackpoint falls off. Not sure if I should glue it in place and shut up.- The 1600x900 display is outdated and there is no better display option. It lacks contrast and brightness compared to today's mainstream laptop displays. My eyes suffered initially but I got used to it. Pickier users wouldn't tolerate it and return the computer.- The speakers are cheap garbage. Even my Blackberry sounds better and louder :). Anyway I frequently use headphones, so I tend to forget about this issue.", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great buy", "Author": "Kristopher A.
