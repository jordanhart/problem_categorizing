This is our 4th Acer.  He is not a techie so he loves that all the processes are comfortable to operate and easy to learn new.  We both love Windows 7 and it is hard to find.  Not interested in Windows 8.  As we all know how much of an improvement Window 7 is from Vista you can't even compare the two. The 17.3 screen is larger than his last.  The clarity of the screen is awesome on Acer for the price", "Date": "May 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Bought it for the mother-in-law and it is working out well", "Author": "Wild Blue Yonder \"Dr. Zulu\"", "ReviewID": "R1UXLTRBJMNUFH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had it shipped to my place and did some tailoring to make the desktop look as much like the XP2003 version that the Acer was replacing.In general I was impressed working with this machine. Windows 7 is not as bad as I thought it was going to be and the OS made it easy to navigate. The Acer seems to be robust, the built-in video cam is high quality and overall seems like a responsive machine with the caveat that I was doing simple things.I liked the feel of the keyboard. I disabled the pad and bought a wifi mouse since my mother-in-law has not had pad experience and I thought keeping things as they were was best policy. Next time we visit, I will ask her if she would like to try the pad and turn it on for a trial run if she says yes.", "Date": "May 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "DVD player", "Author": "Delano W Bolter", "ReviewID": "R210F7KH66FE4F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The DVD player  does not operate properly as the manual button is nonfunctional, it will open only by going to computer and using eject plus it will not recognize a blank disc in order to create a backup.etc.", "Date": "May 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "5 Star in my Book", "Author": "Sandra McKinnon", "ReviewID": "R3UVOHXIKHL1WH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I liked the price, the size of the screen, Acer appears to be a very reliable brand,  It arrived just a few days after I ordered it and I am very pleased with the purchase,", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "not real thrilled with labtop purchase", "Author": "Miranda Brink", "ReviewID": "R1O69CSL190R7R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Wanted windows 7.

After receiving a Toshiba which I did not like the feel of the keys, with windows 8 which i despised, this laptop after returning the Toshiba, was like returning to an old friend.  The keys feel much better on this laptop, and even though it has a newer version of windows 7, can figure out what doesn't load and work the same as on old laptop.  When it comes time to get another laptop, will spend 3 times the money and buy a mac if windows does not come out with a more user friendly program by then..", "Date": "June 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Our previous computer developed a fatal problem, we had to bid farewell to it.
