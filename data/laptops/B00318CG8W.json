I've had it less than a week, so we'll see how it holds up.FastNo problems with stuck-on pixels.Nice keyboard.  The DV4 has a full sized keyboard with full sized arrow keys.  It actually has LEDs next to the Caps Lock and Num Lock keys.  The num lock feature almost made me re-install the OS because I didn't realize it was on, and I couldn't log in.  I had just used the windows easy transfer, and rebooted, and I was unable to log in.  Lessons learned here:  make sure you make a password reset disk, and make sure you make a second account just in case your first one gets locked out for some reason.  Also burn your DVDs for system restore.LED backlight for battery conservation.Looks cool.  The volume control and WiFi on/off switch above the keyboard are more of a proximity sensor, and are cool.Comes with windows  7 home premium.Wireless works well.Cons:The far right corner is dim, about a square centimeter area right in the corner.  If I move my head to look directly at it, it's not very dim.  You might not even notice unless you move the task bar like I do.The screen is glossy.  All laptops have glossy screens except for a few Dell business laptops.  HP might have one too that you can special order.The hard drive is a little noisy (but I believe any noise is too much), and a little warm.  The fan spins constantly, but you can turn it off in the BIOS (it still cycles when it needs to).Other:The touchpad seems like it has a lot of friction at first, but it got better, and if I use the tip of my finger with light pressure it glides just fine.  The touchpad screen scroll feature works well.  Has a button to turn off the touchpad if you don't want to use it.", "Date": "February 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "I like this laptop!", "Author": "Happy Customer", "ReviewID": "R3JM9UNK98UAX3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this laptop for 1 week and have had no problems. I don't find it to be any hotter than my Toshiba Satellite. The Toshiba fan vents on the side, but the battery compartment was hot from the start. The Hp vents on the bottom left rear corner, but the battery area stays relatively cool - so all in all it is about the same as the Toshiba for heat levels. My CPU usage stays in the 3% to 19% for all of the activities I have done so far (I use the \"gadget\" that came with the Desktop features to monitor the CPU usage). The keyboard has a nice firm touch to it and the touchpad is fine, just different - it is a smooth metal surface. The one thing that I have discovered (which is why I only gave it 4 stars) is that the internal wireless adapter - Atheros AR9285 802.11b/g/n WiFi Adapter - caps out at a speed of 150 Mbps. I went online to the Atheros website and read the specs, because I thought something was wrong with it initially - I was expecting a higher speed than that. I had purchased an inexpensive wireless N adapter from Amazon, for the Toshiba, that caps @ 270 Mbps and runs perfectly. I am thinking of using it with this HP, even though it is bulky, because I can see a download speed difference with large graphics. The speakers sound fine, far better than my Toshiba that stuttered everytime the fan turned on. I wish it had come with a longer life battery and a USB port in the rear. I am planning on replacing the battery with a 12 cell. I use a vendor on Ebay and have had good luck with their batteries - prices are great. The DVD drive is a little noisy so that's a minus. I really like the dedicated scroll \"bar\" on the side of the touchpad. I did not realize when I was first configuring the Hp that there is a button to turn on the touchpad. Mine arrived with the touchpad turned off as the default and it took me several minutes to figure out why I could not manipulate the touchpad. Operator error clearly. So far, so good. I got this laptop for $649 after the $50 rebate that is not eligible through Amazon, unfortunately. So for $649, I am very pleased.", "Date": "February 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Power, Performance, Style.", "Author": "K.

For my price range, there was no computer that even came close to the \"H.P. DV4 2160us\", and i mean no computer. Whether I'm blazing around the Internet, watching or burning DVDs, labeling the DVDs there's power a plenty and it runs cooler than most. A really pleasant surprise was how well the laptop speakers sound. The new Intel processor is noticeably faster than there previous version. All in all, if your looking for a notebook, that does it all, and looks great doing it with a easy to use keyboard, look no further. I highly recommend this model.

For price, features and performance, this is a good deal.  I found this at a local office store on sale for $650 after a $50 mail in rebate.Pro's:*\"N\" wireless -awesome speed!  I am registering 150 mbps vs. 50mbps on my old \"G\"*14\" screen*i5 processor*4 gb memory*320 hdd*hd output*built in, removable remote control for the dvd player.windows 7 - it is amazingly stable.  Not a single crash since I bought this laptop 6 weeks ago!*volume control uses a cool touch sensitive slide*mute and antenna buttons are also cool and touch sensitive*great plaid dark brown, almost black look*removable cd/dvd drive reduces the weight of the computer.  Also, may allow for easy blue ray upgrade?Con's:*battery life is fair at best.  Maybe 2 hours with a full charge.*unit is a little thicker than some of the more cooler looking thin laptops.*Cooling vent is on the bottom. This deserves some explanation.  First, I looked at this feature before buying and in my opinion, the new laptops with the newer \"i\" processors seem to run cooler than older models.  Also, there is a vent on the top of the computer directly above the bottom vent, to the left where the base and screen are hinged.  You can only see the top vent when the unit is open.  It seems that when the laptop is on a pillow for example and blocking the bottom vent, the top vent takes over releasing the heat but not quite as well as the bottom when not blocked.  At least it seems that way to me.*the unit does run a bit warm when using on a pillow and I am careful to monitor the temperature since my last computer dies this way.*hp should have put the vents on the side!My brother bought a Dell just 2 months before I bought this and he got a pre-i5 processor and g wireless.  In comparison, the hp is much better in performance and price.Highly recommended.", "Date": "March 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice Laptop", "Author": "daviddlg", "ReviewID": "RRPRQBKIIYR2J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great value for a acceptable performance laptop, the only flaw I can tell is the battery, it is fully discharged after 110 minutes.", "Date": "July 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "3 week review", "Author": "Amber", "ReviewID": "R3C0LI69ZXHRO5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought two of these laptop off amazon in june '10. One for myself and one for my sister.Pros:1.The laptop is quite fast, and handles all the loads of regular work as well as mid level programming and software development with ease.2. The build quality seems very solid and gives an overall good feel.3.The preinstalled overhead softwares are not too much, thus are easily managed( removed)4. the battery life is also quite decent, without WIFI, i get about 3 hrs+Cons:1. The most annoying is that it is very glossy, thus during usage, a lot finerprints etc are left on it2. The volume and the wifi button are touch sensitive buttons, but it  doesnt always work smothely.3. Graphics card is sorely missed on this laptop.4. The touchpad top is very close to the space bar, thus i hit it quite ofter while typing fast.(could be due to my typing style though)Overall review:buy it any day if you like a normal sized, good quality laptop. But if you work outdoors or have a lot of dirt etc around, i would avoid it coz of its very glossy finish.Overall its terrific value for money, anyday..", "Date": "July 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good with minor flaws", "Author": "Timothy Ryan Leek", "ReviewID": "RCF0BFA2QJJOS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "OK, I bought this laptop to replace a Vista 64, Core2Duo laptop made by Gateway.  This laptop is beautiful and has the latest line of Intel processors in it, the \"I\" series with Turbo Boost technology, which is why i wanted to upgrade.  While the laptop seems to be quite fast, I do have a few negatives:1. Not enough USB ports (there are only 2).  My older Gateway, which is the same physical size, had 4.2. BLOATWARE GALORE!! HP's bloatware is rediculous.  I highly recommend reformatting the hard drive immediately when you get it and choosing HP's installation of minimum software.  When you reinstall Windows using the recovery partition, you can select this option which only loads the basic software, not all the junk that is preloaded at the factory.3. Hard Drive issue: I got a black screen on startup asking me to scan the hard disk drive for errors (check disk-chkdsk for those who know Windows).  This usually occurs when their are problems with the hard disk drive-bad sectors, etc.  I'm now a little concerned about the state of the hard drive, something you shouldn't experience with a week old computer.4. FINGER PRINT MAGNET!!!  While the laptop is beautiful, the thing is a total finger print magnet.  I have to keep a roll of anti-static moist wipes next to the thing because it picks up every little touch.  Trust me, when I bought this I thought people were over reacting when I saw comments about the computer being a finger print magnet, but it is very true.  You will not be able to keep it clean.5. The Windows Experience Index fell short of my expectations.  This is due to the RAM (memory operations per second), the Graphics (desktop performance for Windows Aero), and the gaming graphics (3D business and gaming graphics performance).  The total Windows Experience Rating on this machine is 4.7.  My home PC running a Core2Duo (E8400) is 5.9.  I'm sure this rating is because the laptop lacks a good graphics card such as my Radeon HD4850 thats in my home PC.  So, long story short, this laptop is not designed for gaming or high-end graphics work like video editing, etc.  I do have Photoshop on it which runs quite well, but don't buy this machine if you want to do high end graphics stuff.Other than those few things, I'm overall happy with my purchase.", "Date": "May 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "good laptop", "Author": "McP \"M\"", "ReviewID": "R3I19GZKL8BXMZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop because I really need one mid size laptop. This laptop is not very big, 14.1 inches, and it is easy to handle. I thought the screen was to little, but now I think it is enough. The laptop has a Intel Core i5 processor, and I think that's enough to any software I have to use. It comes with the windows 7 64-bit OS, and I like it. Sometimes I think it goes a little slow for being an Intel Core i5, but probably is just the way it is. The other features are good enough for me, 4GB RAM, 1066 Mhz bus speed, the remote control (it is a nice touch). The bay is extractable and that good also. The only thing that I do not like is that the laptop does not have a video card (Nvidia or ATI), but any way I think is a very good deal for the price. I have had some troubles with the laptop. Once, the computer didn't turn off, I closed the lid and put it in my backpack, but it did not hibernate. So when I take it out, it was really hot, I called HP and they solved the problem quickly. The other thing is the SPLASHTOP software, I think it does not work properly. It used to instantly appeared when I used to turn it on, but I was not able to connect the computer to the wireless, so I told that to HP and they download and install the old BIOS archive through the internet, and the SPLASHTOP software no longer appears when I turn the laptop on. When I talked to HP, I do not know if the knew what is SPLASHTOP, probably they know, but I didn't have it clear, and I think they didn't have a clue of why it was not working properly. The other thing is the touchpad, sometimes the pointer moves really slowly, no matter how fast I sweep my finger. Some other times the scroll bar does not function properly. I don't why this happens, but I have an old HP and the touch pad is really good. The texture of the touch pad in this laptop is not rough, and just like any other plastic part in the laptop, and I think that bad too, sometimes I think I am touching the touch pad, but I am not. Anyway I think it is very good laptop for the price (it has very good features [processor and bus speed are the most important for me]).ADDENDUM: The keyboard is really bad. The letter or symbol wrote in each key, turns brown with the use. And there is no way to turn it white again.", "Date": "March 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "LAN card busted after few months...", "Author": "Jure", "ReviewID": "R2Z5Z8IXDRKERI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The LAN card went bad after a few months.  Downloads are as slow as 56k modem downloads, uploads are lightning fast. That isn't the problem really, but the problem is how HP Customer Service is handling this issue.  The online reps told me to install the \"HP Care Advisor\" and said that should help analyze the issue.  He offered no other help or explanation.I took my laptop to 2 different HP service centers and at both centers they're telling me that my LAN card is OK but that this is a problem with the operating system.  I re-installed Windows 7 two times, with all updates.  I fresh-installed Vista back onto the computer + updates and STILL the problem remains.  Downloads are super slow, while my uploads are super fast (normal speed).I took my computer to ANOTHER, private service shop, and the tech told me the LAN card was bad.

Navigating is always snappy and i have not had any problems with the processor or memory. However, Since windows 7 is a memory hog i have elected to upgrade the system to 8GB DDR3. It now runs flawlessly and i can not complain about the performance. I bought this laptop off of craigslist for 250 dollars which i think was an ok deal. I could have bought a  brand new computer for that much but i wouldnt be getting an i5 for that price.... My only major complaints are as follows:the original software that comes on the machine is intrusive. I recommend a complete boot and nuke of the hard drive and reinstall windows and the drivers to your liking. Also, the speakers are plenty loud, however, the keys like to rattle uncontrollably to the point to where you can no longer hear the sound... You can only hear the rattling keys... I find my self trying to cover the rattling keys with my hand to control keep them from vibrating but they still do it... The battery doesn't last worth a flip. With the screen brightness turned all the way down, just doing normal browsing on the internet, the battery might last an hour before it starts crying. That might be because its a few years old and needs a new battery but you would think it would last longer... LSecondly, the fan on this thing is really loud, and the heat it puts off gets pretty dang hot. If you leave it on your lap or bed it could possibly overheat depending on the sleep mode you have it on. it can burn your legs too so don't put it on your legs... Lastly, the screen is never 100% viewable. I find my self moving it up and down trying to find the best viewing angle only to find that I am disappointed at my self for even trying, knowing that it will never happen.i love that it has HDMI because i constantly stream movies onto my 50\" HDTV and the quality is TOP NOTCH. It seriously looks like i popped a DVD in so that is definitely a pluspros: fast, HDMI with HD quality, upgradable, plenty of places to plug stuff in, SD reader, cheap, lots of connectors, will handle high quality games \"but not all on extreme graphics\", looks pretty, not too heavycons: keys rattle and vibrate and are almost as loud as the sound coming out of the speakers, dvd drive kind of slow, heat coming out of bottom corner is hot and placement is bad, HP software sucks needing windows reinstall, battery doesn't last very long, screen is not 100% viewable,all in all i would recommend this computer but would not pay more than 350 dollars for it since it is 3 or 4 years old. Despite all my cons, i would buy this computer again because i know it will last a long time, and is fast enough to not worry about it being outdated too soon.", "Date": "July 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hot and heavy, but it does the job", "Author": "RedSchorsch", "ReviewID": "R28DJWDG078U41", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this computer because it fit my price range, had the new (at the time) i5 processor, windows 7, it looked nice, and the screen size and keyboard were what I was looking for. It is nice to type on, I can type on this computer better than any other computer I own, but the keys are slick and grime up very easily. Same goes for the slick feel of the entire computer. You can clean it off but your hands always leave it marked up and slimy feeling. The touchpad looks nice but I often find myself having to click the lock/unlock button on it to get it to respond properly (occasionally glitches on me).All of those problems are tolerable, they aren't pleasing but I can live with them considering I have never had one issue with how the computer actually performs. In fact, it boots up fast, can run games (a friend of mine put Diablo II on here because his computer couldn't run it), nice screen resolution, picks up wifi better than most laptops I've used, and Windows 7 is a great software (hardware?).What I absolutely hate about this computer are four things: the weight, the horrible battery life, the heat-sensitive volume sensor above the keyboard, and the heat that it puts out. I'll start with the heat issue. This computer will make you sweat in a 65 degree room. I watched a movie on netflix with this computer and put it on my 1.5\" thick wooden coffee table; you could feel the heat from the computer THROUGH THE TABLE. I took my sock off and touched my foot under the table and the heat was there under the table. That's how hot this thing is. The battery claims 4.5hr life, but if I charge it fully and then unplug it, the battery dies within an hour of full use (writing a paper, for example). This Thanksgiving I charged the computer fully, it was off and closed, and then I unplugged it and took it on my flight back to Utah (from Seattle). When I got to the airport, without turning on my computer, it was dead. Flat out dead. No use. Complete crap of a battery. As for weight, it says that it is between five and six pounds. Maybe, but if feels more like 10. And last but not least, the volume control must be some very old touch/heat-sensitive technology because there is nothing \"sensitive\" about it. I have had countless instances where I have tried to turn a video or song up just a tiny bit, and the volume control doesn't read it, so I keep trying and eventually the volume just maxes out. This happens well after I finished touching the controls. I don't understand, but it sucks.Overall, the flaws above aren't enough to keep me from re-buying this computer, but they are enough to irritate the crap out of me. I would recommend this to other people simply because I think these issues might just be isolated to me. Aside from the flaws, this computer has been a workhorse for me and I'm extremely happy about its production.

I debated between this computer and the dv4-2167sb, which were similarly priced.  It basically came down to whether I wanted a fingerprint reader or a better processor (Intel Core i3 vs. i5).  In the end, I chose this computer with the more powerful processor, and I haven't regretted the decision at all.This is my 3rd HP laptop, and definitely my favorite.  I like the look of the Digital Plaid design, and I honestly don't even notice the smaller (14.1\" vs. 15.5\") display.  This has the best speakers of any laptop I've seen; I actually have to turn it down sometimes.  This system also stays noticeably cooler than my older dv5. I was surprised to hear about the issues with noise some reviewers mention, as mine is as quiet as a mouse.  I was also very glad that HP didn't put all those annoying Quick Start buttons above the keyboard on this model.  They might work for some people, but I was always accidentally sweeping them on my dv5 and waiting for Quick Play to open, just so I could close it back down, really bugged me.This laptop also features the Smart Bay, which allows you to lighten up the laptop by 8 ounces by removing the optical drive.  I gotta say:  I'm middle-aged, and not a perfect physical specimen, but this laptop is no back breaker.  I carry mine with me all the time, and  I've never been tempted to removed the drive.  Somehow, the wear and tear on the drive doesn't seem worth saving a half-pound.I'm not really into all the advanced specs, I only know about whether it does what I want it to quickly and consistently.  The Windows Experience Index on this laptop is a 4.5, which is a considerable improvement from the 3.4 rating on my dv5 model.  For everyday web surfing, uploading photos and video, and Windows Office, this computer does a great job.", "Date": "May 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great laptop", "Author": "Nakita", "ReviewID": "R35N6CUL1HSXM9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i thought this was a great little laptop. it was fast and had all the ports i needed. the best thing about it was the weight. light but yet sturdy.

This is a problem since you can lose data if pc goes to sleep while you make a coffee or restroom break and you haven't saved your work before getting up not to mention the annoyance factor of the whole rebooting process which is why I was so excited about getting a new PC running windows 7 that I wouldn't have to reboot constantly. Thanks HP, Microsoft finally gets there act together and you go and screw it up. It's been like this since day one. I use this pc for personal use and school online which means i'm on it all the time and it's a huge inconvenience to have to send it back in. I can't give an accurate review of battery life since I had to go into my settings and shut off all battery saving options. Maybe if HP would spend a little more on components and assembly and a little less on pre-installing worthless proprietary media vendor software...", "Date": "September 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent laptop, very eficient", "Author": "V.

Again, I hear continuous noise during shut-down which is similar to that occurring during start-up and it emits similar mild noise when I open or save files from / to hard disc. This is not even one year after purchase and naturally, I started wondering how a quality (?) product can start behaving abnormally within a few months.I contacted HP tech support (1 800 474 6836) who operates from all over India (cities of Mumbai, Hyderabad, Kolkata etc.) for last few days and each time, a different technical assistant would handle the complaint when I would explain and repeat the same thing to them. Each technical person would suggest different opinions and ask to try out a service pack and/or trouble shoot different options sometimes for more than an hour but were unable to make any conclusion when it is simple and clear from the very noise that it is purely a mechanical problem and not related to vista operating system or any driver software. Some of them promised to replace the hard disc but, seemed to be extremely cautious and each time they would request me to do more repeated troubleshooting.More interestingly, HP technical assistants from Kolkata seemed to respond under a dubbed name as when I asked last name of one of them, he replied that they would not expose their names to customers !!!However, this is not the practice for HP technical assistants from Hyderabad or Mumbai !!!Exasperated, I filed a complaint at HP site [...] where they allow customers to fill in a complaint form when there is no provision for US customers (or any US state)! However, I entered my details clubbing all information in different form fields. I got a complaint identification number and was notified that it had been recorded and would be forwarded to the relevant department.However, I do not have any status update from HP as yet as to redress of my complaint !!!Unfortunately, I did not check and investigate reputation of HP - after sales support before laptop purchase. There are numerous complaints and posts about HP products and especially about its apathy to prompt service... some of the posts indicate that to tackle customer complaints, HP employees write favorable reviews about HP and its products over internet !!!I came to know that a number of customers filed law suit in China against HP and verdict went in customers' favor and HP had to comply with court order.Please read following posts before buying any HP product because of awful and atrocious service of this company !!!The last link gives a comparative analysis of HP with other reputed brands in the market (HP finishes last !!!).[...]Hope this information is useful !", "Date": "March 20, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Intel Core i5-430M processor (2.26GHz with Turbo Boost Technology up to 2.53 GHz)\n4GB DDR3 System Memory (2 DIMM) (expandable to 8 GB)\n320GB (7200RPM) Hard Drive (SATA), LightScribe SuperMulti 8X DVD\u00b1R/RW with Double Layer Support\nGenuine Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit, * Up to 4.25 Hours of Battery Life\n14.1\" Diagonal WXGA HD HP BrightView Widescreen Display (1280 x 800), Intel HD Graphics with up to 1696MB Total Available Graphics Memory", "Name": "HP Pavilion DV4-2160US 14.1-Inch Laptop (Digital Plaid)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41PwAsT%2BTHL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00318CG8W"}}
