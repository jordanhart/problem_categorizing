{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This Dell Inspiron has everything you will need from a laptop", "Author": "Christopher J. Cowen", "ReviewID": "RFQNQ77APFBHN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Dell Inspiron (i17RV-8183BLK) 17.3-Inch Laptop is a great laptop for only $449 dollars. I was in the market for a great laptop and this one definitely fits the bill. This laptop is lightweight and thinner than previous versions of the Dell Inspiron. Once you boot up this device you will notice right away the sharp images this laptop can display. The screen is large (17.3\") and will allow you to do anything you could do on a desktop. The screen displays at 900p (1600 x 900 ) HD. This laptop is filled with many more great features. I have listed a few that I felt were important for you to know before making a purchase. They are as follows:\u2022 Processor: 1.9 GHz Pentium 2127U\u2022 Display: LCD 17.3\" HD Plus WLED AUO\u2022 Memory (RAM): 4GB, DDR3L, 1 DIMM, 1600MHz\u2022 Storage (hard drive): 500GB 5400 rpm HDD (More than enough space)\u2022 Optical Drive: DVDRW +/- 8X TSSTAgain I think you will love this laptop like I do and I would definitely recommend it.Thank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have", "Date": "February 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice!", "Author": "John B. Goode \"JBG\"", "ReviewID": "R21X4TR6HPEZRF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Yes, I have actually purchased this laptop. It was used to replace an IBM 14.1\" with XP.Presentation: Very nice. It's relatively thin, big and a bit heavy compared with a MacBook but then the price is a lot better too. I love the carbon-fiber-like dimpled finish and the color. It actually feels like Dell spent some money on the design rather than handing it off to the engineers for the finish.OS: The biggie. I got the Windows 8.1, which is somewhat of an admission that MS screwed up. I've already used Win 8 on my Android phone but still getting used to it on a laptop. Makes more sense on a small mobile device. Everything I want to do, I'm still using the work around to get back to the old style. Just because it's different doesn't mean it's good and why fix something that isn't broken.Speed: Of course, this is much faster than my old IBM, I love the speed, and I love the price, which is even less than I paid for my IBM when new all those years ago. I've got 4GB of RAM but may upgrade later. The laptop is still new so doesn't have a lot of programs hogging and clogging up processing power. And start up and shut down is so fast it's amazing.Functions: The specs are all posted above so I won't list them here. The only port that I miss is for my old VGA monitor but it has an HDMI port so I just need to get a converter. My printer has wifi and it only took a few seconds for this to connect wirelessly.Overall: I love this laptop. It's fast, looks sharp and the price is great.", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "give yourself a nice gift (not this)", "Author": "Christian De Freitas", "ReviewID": "R2DMFK3CW7FEDQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I do not own this laptop, but my GF and a coworker have thisto begin, its a big laptop, very nice. oddly it doesnt have a VGA port, but only HDMI, 4 usb ports 3 on 1 side and 1 next to the optical drive.its not slow but its not the fastest, right in the middle.i recommend http://amzn.to/1ejUtt7 this laptop to them, but they preffer dell. if you have never used windows 8 get ready to learn something new, the harddisk is in UEFI format so reinstalling windows 7 is a PITAit has a 2nd gen cpu, and with that price range i would have got a 4th gen core i3 like http://amzn.to/1ejUtt7 or http://amzn.to/1fXsxf9.my recomendation is get yourself another 80 dollars and get at least a core i3 4th gen processor laptop.", "Date": "April 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Laptop is as advertised.", "Author": "Satisfied Buyer", "ReviewID": "R2UZIZY1U6GTF2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Unit comes preloaded with Windows 8 (which I detest) and software that wasn't ordered or needed. I was looking for laptop with a a 17\" screen and this filled the requirement. The Intel processor is an Intel 2127U dual core and comes with 4gb DDR3 RAM. It is minimal at best and the unit can only be upgraded to 8gb of RAM. Typical Dell product with limited upgrades.

Getting used to WIN8.1 took only a few days.My one negative is that it's really snooty about connecting to my other PCs on the network with different OSes via WIFI, though it's OK with the one using Ethernet and XP. I still haven't figured out how to get it to talk to my WIN7 WIFI laptop. Fortunately the laptop talks to the XP machine OK, so I can connect to the new LT through the WN7 laptop and the XP desktop for now.It connected to the Xfinity TC8305C modem/router and Internet without a problem.", "Date": "May 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent Computer", "Author": "Luther H.
