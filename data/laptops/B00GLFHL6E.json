I am happy I bought it!", "Author": "Holly Hood", "ReviewID": "RZUVS4Y7WGWCT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research on computers and tablets the other day and I knew one thing. I wanted a computer that was also a tablet. I am an author and I do a lot of writing and I wanted something easy to transport anywhere I wanted. Most tablets do not run windows and the few that do are not that lovely in my opinion. I almost bought a surface, but thankfully I went to Best Buy and saw one in person first. It was too small and flimsy for my liking.I never even saw this one on here when I was looking, when we went to Best Buy and saw this I was sold. It is the same size as most laptops. It has a really large screen and best part it has an amazing keyboard. Not those flat thin ones, it is perfect for someone like me who needs a good one for typing.I love just about everything about it. Especially the touch feature. I love how I can just detach the keyboard and go wherever I want. It has everything I could possibly need and want.The only thing I think I would say I wish was better would be the sound. The speakers are not that loud. But it's not that big of a deal. But if you are looking for a great sound system this is not it. I haven't really fiddled with the settings too much but as far as I know the sound is not that loud.I think it is a great buy and I love it.", "Date": "February 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good product", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"totribet\"", "ReviewID": "R6M5I87IWKABH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just bought this yesterday and am still getting to know it.  But so far I am very pleased with it overall.  It seems to perform great.  Easily accessible.  I like the flexibility of being able to use it as a tablet or a laptop.  It reattaches to the keyboard easily and I haven't really had any problems navigating around it.  I'm really enjoying it and I feel that it was a good purchase.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent for the price", "Author": "David Rogacki", "ReviewID": "R4OGO9IKASVKR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best deal for a tablet /laptop combo computer I could find as far as memory and price combo.

I must say that the windows 8 is neat but is complicated without a start menu, and plainly no start menu is just stupid for a windows operating system. The keyboard on this Toshiba laptop is pretty stiff, you really have to push down to get the keys to work which I've never experienced on other laptops. While this laptop/tablet is a powerhouse, I recommend looking into a laptop with at least 8 gigs of ram instead of 4.", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "No Auto-rotate", "Author": "David Crawford", "ReviewID": "R1CRPCQ1XTKNXE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this device for its price and specs. It is powerful for $500. However, it performs misserably. It freezes or opens wrong apps on a regular basis. And most importantly, there is no auto rotate function for the screen. This is a bery basic function that even the cheapest Andtoid tablets have. The video driver for tjis tablet does not have the auto rotate function, and there are no updated frivers with the function. A horrible oversite by the designers of this device. I am returning it ASAP.", "Date": "February 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "so upset", "Author": "amber", "ReviewID": "R21QFJZ8529O16", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was realy loving my new toshiba 2 in 1 click notebookTablet until iwoke up today on the 3/10 /2014 I bought this babby from amazon on feb the 6th last month  and it was working ood but one time when I restarted it the other day it had these weard looking squigly lines before it went back in to windows I should have known then there was some thing wrong but I egnord it and  I use to fix and bild computers for a liveing till my eye site got to bad to do it any more any ways I pushed the power button on the side of the screen and it wouldn't come on so I called toshiba tec support and the sweet girl sayed she would stepp me through to get itup again she told me to turn it over and remove the batter I had already giveing her the modle number and serial #on the bottem u would think they would have some sort of info on the computers they sale guess not I told her it was 2 in 1 click tablet  the new one and there is no battery door on the bottem or the removeablt tablet screen so she said it wouldhave to be sebt in for repair to there center and said to back up all my files on I told her that would be possable if the hard drive was abble to take out but there is no door for the hard drive eather she asked if when I opend it did see 3tabs closetothelatch relise I said noit is anew 2 in1 notebook tablet the new notebooks are not made with any plastic at all she didn't even know what one looked like so toshiba is suppose to send me a box and labbles so I can send it in for repair I had another toshiba the heard drive went out under warnety long ago that they replaced the hard drive on 7years ago and it is still going strong I gave t to my son it has wimax service so he can go any where and has internet wish they still made them but they don't so I'll be wating for my new notebook to get repaired last time isent one to them got itback good as new in only 4 days hope that's all it takes this time then will repost and give it a better rateing I hope", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$463.00", "Features": "AMD Dual-Core A4-1200 Accelerated Processor 1.0 GHz with AMD Radeon HD 8180 graphics\n13.3\" LED-backlit high-definition widescreen 10-point touch-screen display\n500GB Serial ATA hard drive (5400 rpm), 4GB DDR3L memory, No Optical drive included\nBuilt-in 0.9MP high-definition camera with microphone, Built-in high-speed wireless LAN (802.11b/g/n), Bluetooth 4.0 interface\nMicrosoft Windows 8 64-bit, Weighs 4.8 lbs. and measures just 1\" thin", "Name": "Toshiba - Satellite Click 2-in-1 13.3\" Touch-Screen Laptop - 4GB Memory - 500GB Hard Drive - Ultimate Silver", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418BWzRljOL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00GLFHL6E"}}
