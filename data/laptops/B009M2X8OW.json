{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Worth the $$$", "Author": "Thinkblue", "ReviewID": "R2YLFZOJN2MFHK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Build:First of all, the build quality on this machine is EXCELLENT. Having never owned any asus product, I'm seriously impressed at the build quality on this thing. Even though I only paid $899, this feels like a $1500+ machine. The aluminum finish is fantastic and feels really good. I will say it's a bit of a fingerprint magnet, but that's nothing a quick wipe with a cloth won't fix. Also, since Amazon doesn't disclose this, the ASUS logo on the front lid is BACKLIT. Some reviewers have knocked on the weight a bit, but for everything you're getting, it's a non issue. Unless you weigh about 30lbs, I don't see how you could knock on the weight.Keyboard:The keyboard is great. I very much enjoy the feel of the keys and the response is excellent. Even for someone with big hands like me, I have no trouble typing at full speed. Also, this keyboard is BACKLIT for those of you not sure, and it looks great in the dark. You can also adjust the level of brightness as you see fit.Touchpad:Wasn't too happy with this at first but I've grown to like it. I'm a big fan of the pinch to zoom and all the other features it comes with. Yes, sometimes you might not get the exact response you want or you'll accidentally zoom in on something, but the touchpad is great. No regrets and no serious complaints.Performance:Initial boot up takes a bit, but even with all of the bloatware ASUS puts on this thing, it's pretty fast. The i7 along with the 6GB of RAM really makes navigating through all programs a breeze and I've no freeze ups or noticeable lag. I plan on installing an SSD sometime in the near future and doing a clean install but for the average user, there shouldn't be any performance issues.Graphics:As some reviewers have previously mentioned, you are using dual cards for graphics. The laptop uses the Intel 4000 for non extensive actions and the NVIDIA for heavy graphic tasks such as gaming. I don't really plan on gaming at all so this is perfect for me. But from what I've read, gaming shouldn't be an issue.Display & Sound:The display is AMAZING. Videos, websites, programs......everything looks excellent. Hands down the best display I've used on a Windows machine. I would highly recommend pushing for 1080p if possible. The sound quality for a laptop is amazing. It's loud and clear. I've just started doing insanity workouts and using this and the sound and look of everything is amazing. No complaints at all. I haven't used the included speaker, but I'll get around to it. Webcam is also nice and clear and video chatting is no issue. Other party can hear me loud and clear with no echo.Overall, I am completely satisfied with my purchase.", "Date": "September 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Everything you could need in a laptop", "Author": "cjl73", "ReviewID": "RL804G7J7FKV6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I asked a few questions about this laptop from other reviewers but could not get an answer... to anyone who needs to know, it does indeed have a backlit keyboard.

I ordered in hope that it would have a backlit keyboard, and I got lucky.I will update this review with more info if I find anything worth remarking on - the specs speak for themselves, and of course there is a ton of nonsense bloatware, but that's easily dealt with.I highly recommend this machine to anyone who wants something that looks good and you can be proud to own.", "Date": "August 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Details you're going to Want to Know before Buying", "Author": "Glen R. Goodwin", "ReviewID": "R2RXSG9GDKQATU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Received it yesterday, great turn around time by Amazon.  That said, I have the following gripes with this laptop already.1). I bought this laptop hopefully to build a Hardware Specification equivalent of a Macbook Pro without paying the Apple Hardware Tax and without having to use MACOS.2). Window 8 Sucks.  Hated it immediately. I would have bought the Windows 7 version of this Laptop, except it is slightly different and has less base memory.  So I bought the Windows 8 version and just installed my own copy of Windows 7.3). The UEFI is locked to Windows 8.  I removed the hard drive and replaced it with a SSD.  The Boot process would not hand-off to Windows 7 during the setup process when using UEFI and mounting Windows 7 install as a CD.  If I toggled the \"Launch CSM\" setting in the BIOS to \"Enabled\" this worked fine, but without UEFI.  Less exciting but still very usable.  (CSM means Compatibility Support Module and it's a UEFI setting for backwards compatibility with older BIOS devices.)4). The only 16gb memory I was able to get to work to upgrade this machine to 16gb was Kingston ValueRAM 8GB 1600MHz DDR3 (PC3-12800) Non-ECC CL11 SODIMM Notebook Memory (KVR16S11/8).  I tried three other sets of 16gb DIMMs without any of them working before I found the Kingston.  Thanks to the person in the comments who suggested it.5). The upgrade plate is on the bottom toward the front and merely requires removing the one center front screw.  This involves prying up the plastic foot thing in the center and unscrewing.  Easy access to the HDD, the Memory and the NIC from there.6). The laptop was both heavier and thicker than I expected.  This is not a fault of what is reported, but a fault of my expectations.  Temper your own expectations to match.7). As others have noted here and elsewhere, the trackpad gets in the way of typing sometimes.  It's very easy to click things with you wrist while typing.  I personally think this is true of many laptops due to my own typing style, so YMMV.8). Once I got Win7 installed on the SSD, this laptop screams.  Really loved how fast it boots.  Haven't installed much yet though, so we will see.9). If I could not have gotten Win7 working I would have RMA'd this faster than you can say... well, just about anything.10). If you are looking for Windows 7 x64 Drivers, you will not find them on the Asus website under the N56VJ model.  You need to look under the N56VZ model and use those drivers.  The N56VJ and the N56VZ are basically the same computer with slightly different specs.  All the drivers are common and seem to work just fine. Drivers can be found there.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice laptop for the price", "Author": "HHC", "ReviewID": "R2AY04T08EHQUR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received this laptop about four days ago and still in the process of removing and loading software.  Started with the standard operating procedure, Windows updates and removing McAfee (this requires a special removal tool from the McAfee website to do a clean uninstall).  Had trouble with the wireless connection crashing and had to call Asus customer support who directed my to their website to download a new driver for the Atheros AR9485-EG wireless adaptor.  Seems to have taken care of the problem from what I can tell.  1920 x 1080 resolution is nice - most models with that resolution are $1,200 or more....  750 GB and 6 GB ram - great specs. Having some problem with the spacebar.  I type about 70 w/minute and it doesn't respond as well as I am used to unless I hit it dead center and pretty firm.  Other people reported a similar problem after researching this issue in forums.  I will wait for a few days and if needed have Asus install a new keyboard under warranty.  Sound/speakers are OK - not great and for movies I would recommend external speakers.  This model has the separate numeric keyboard off to the side (good for working on spreadsheets) which makes the model a bit larger and likely heavier.Ran down the battery yesterday and got over 4 hours out of it - no games but lots of installing and downloading.  Good buy for the price and is has everything once could ask for for a desktop laptop.Update - I had to return the first laptop because I did not want to go through the hassle of getting the keyboard repaired - Amazon exchanged it with no problem (same model) and the keyboard on the replacement laptop works great.  The first one didn't have the backlighting (or maybe it was a driver problem) this one works without any hitches.", "Date": "August 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Much much better than I expected. Screen and sound are amazing!", "Author": "Misha", "ReviewID": "R1E6GWKRX0T5O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good:-The best screen on any Windows machine released so far!-The sound quality is amazing!-Premium quality overall!-It is really fast!-Very nice soft back-lid keyboard!Bad:-This machine is relatively bulky for 15.6 inch laptop.-Quality control issues. My first machine was defective (crack under monitor). I had to replace it.Conclusion:Perfect home multimedia center. At this price level there is no competitors at all! There are no other 15.6 inch laptops with the same specification and the same screen and sound quality under 1000$.I expected it to be a good machine but it is much better than I expected!!!!!!!Update:After listening to music on this laptop for a month I realized that with this laptop you probably dont need any external speakers. The sound quality is just that good.Update:I have been taking this laptop to my work to use it with DELL 2408WFP UltraSharp 24-Inch Monitor. Usually most external monitors beat any laptop monitor. And this Dell is relatively expensive and accurate monitor. Monitor on ASUS laptop represents colors much more accurately than external Dell monitor!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Update: After 6 month of using this beautful machine I think that it has the best screen on any electronic device I saw. Colors on this machine are bette then on iPad 3, my panasonic 42 inch plasma, my HTC sensation and any other electronic monitor I have look at in my life. Defenitely there are some professional monitors for 1000 dollars that might have better colors, but for a notebook I colors on this screen are probably unbeatable. When Apple presented iPad 3 they wanted to make a big deal with its screen. In real life iPad 3 has very high resolution but just good colors, nothing exeptional. Screen on this laptop is trully exaptional.", "Date": "August 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Near perfect specs at a cost", "Author": "Burdened", "ReviewID": "R37YFK50Z5LPOF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, the price of this laptop:As you can tell on the price cut for this product, it normally is priced at the level of apple products. The price for the item is very much a profitable deal considering the graphics card placement and the keyboard.Second, the Graphics card:Utilizing a dual card schema, the laptop uses an Intel 4000 for less difficult work in order to preserve battery power. When graphics extensive actions are done, such as gaming, the Nvidia GT takes over. On top of this, the graphics cards sync rather well. Graphically, gaming is no issue.Third, the processor:Nothing to be said here. Top of the line i7 quad-core.Fourth, the keyboard:Not included in the description is that it IS in fact backlit. Major plus.Fifth, the touchpad:I can offer no real feedback for it considering I always connect a wireless mouse on laptops.Sixth, miscellaneous features:Six pounds. Though seemingly heavy, with all of these specs inside the machine, nothing can be done to change that. The color and build of the laptop itself is what is expected of ASUS: sleek and easy on the eyes. Face recognition software comes with the laptop, though personal utilization of it is limited. Another point to note is that the laptop comes with speakers, though I personally have had little success with it. But, the built-in sound system is crisp and clear.", "Date": "August 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "So far so good", "Author": "Neural", "ReviewID": "RKSJTWZ7I2AEO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I spent a lot of time searching for this machine. Well, okay, I spent 5 hours one night waiting for my paycheck to clear. I investigated a lot of different machines, including the higher-end Asus gamer rigs, and I settled on this one. Including tax I spent about $450 less than I would have on one of those boxes, and I'm happy with my purchase so far. So let's get into the review.The good:The screen is really good, but it's not as good as my Vaio from several years ago. Basically the viewing angle is great left-to-right, but the vertical viewing angle leaves a bit to be desired. It's still better than my last laptop, a Toshiba Satellite. This one has about 20 degrees of vertical tolerance, and the matte finish helps a lot with sunlight, so it's at least a step-up from my last machine. Cautious thumb-up on the screen, it's within my tolerance zone, and when you view it at the correct angle it looks fantastic.Performance is very respectable. Diablo 3 runs full detail with everything on high in 1280x768. LA Noire runs about 50 frames in the same resolution on performance detail (though you have to hack it to overcome the hardcoded 30fps limit), about 30 frames with detail on max.The build quality is impressive. The unit feels very solid, and I'm impressed that it comes with 1 year of accidental damage protection. Amazon tried to upsell me a year, and I almost bought it because I didn't realize that it already came with the unit. My friend tells me the Amazon policy kicks in after the manufacturer policy, so it still might be worth it if you want to play it safe, but I'm confident I won't drop my laptop, so I'm going to gamble for a year. I don't mind the island keyboard at all, and I haven't had any problems with the spacebar like other reviewers reported.The audio is great. I don't expect much from onboard speakers, so to say I'm impressed is an understatement. Clean, crisp separation of the left and right channels, you'd almost think it was magic, provided you are right on top of the machine. In my experience laptop speakers fade out over time, though, so I wouldn't make my purchase based on that. It's just an added bonus.The bad:The home, pgup, pgdn, and end keys are in a crappy spot. That will take a lot of getting used to.The unit isn't raised on the bottom, so you have to keep it on a flat surface at all times. I'm using my old broken laptop for the time being as a surface.6GB ram? Really? I think Asus did that just to make you buy a more expensive machine. The 8GB models cost a lot more. I'll be popping my own ram in before too long.Occasionally the swap-monster eats my mouse movements. So far this hasn't happened in games, but it's concerning. I'm planning to upgrade to an SSD (or maybe 2 SSDs) before too long. I'll update the review when I do that.The air runs pretty damn hot when I play games. For now it's not a problem. The bottom of the unit feels only slightly warm. Over time this will mean I will need to dust out the unit to prevent it from overheating, and the problem with that plan is that the intake for the fan is far, far away from the vent. So I'm thinking I'm probably going to have to take it apart from time to time to get the dust out, instead of using my standard strategy of just blowing out the fan. In fact if past experience is any indication, I might just replace the fan. Laptop manufacturers tend to cheap out on them.The trackpad is not quite as bad as people say it is, but give up on pressing the corners. But hell, I knew it sucked going in, and I usually plug in a mouse anyway. I'd recommend getting yourself a bluetooth mouse and disabling the thing. Still, given all the terrible reviews on it, it's surprisingly usable. I haven't had a problem with multi-touch.I will update this review as the machine ages.Update, ~1.5 weeks:1. The trackpad really is as bad as everyone says. I take back anything good I had to say about it. Get a bluetooth mouse for sure.2. There is definitely a problem with video playback and audio glitches with the software that ships with the unit. I would recommend this computer, so far, to an intermediate to advanced user. The problem seems to be related to McCafee. I couldn't swear on it, but after I got rid of it the glitches seemed to go away. Bottom line is that I recommend reinstalling the entire operating system, and wiping the disk.3. My computer crashed over Thanksgiving. I think it was my fault but I'll never have proof. The machine comes with a C: and a D: partition. I married the partitions, and the next time I booted the machine, I couldn't boot windows. Long story short I had to reinstall. So far the machine is a lot better than the factory installation, so I would recommend wiping the machine for advanced users and the adventurous.This is a nice little machine if you (are, or) have a really good friend who is a nerd. After having to reinstall I am waiting for the other shoe to drop. I will update again as new information is available :).Update 2 weeks:I'm downing my rating to 4 for a few reasons.1. It's a damn good screen, and has a nice finish, but the leds are too bright at the top and bottom edges.2. As someone pointed out in the comments, the battery life is pretty standard for Windows machines -- bad. About 3 hours with a brand new battery. I have access to power most of the time so it's not a big deal for me. For some others it probably will be.3. Having run for a few days after my own clean install, it shows how crappy the factory software install was. Definitely reformat if you can lay hands on a Windows 7 home premium 64bit disk (your license key that ships with the unit works with any Win7 HP64 disk).4. The trackpad is even worse than a lot of people say... it's above the bezel a little in spots on my unit.But after a reinstall it runs super-smooth with very decent graphics performance as well, which was my main objective. I'm not sorry I didn't get the ROG laptup instead, so overall I'm still pretty positive about the purchase.Hard drive hasn't gone bad on me or anything, but seeing as that's a common problem I may get an SSD sooner rather than later. I kinda knew that going in as well. To some others in the comments: I considered Samsung but IIRC the units I saw had ATI cards. After my linux experiences I insist on NVidia for now. The card in this one is pretty decent, but I'm sure it will be out of date in about 2 years or so. It's not top of the line or anything, but it will play XCom and Skyrim in high detail, especially after the reinstall.", "Date": "November 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic power, nice details everywhere, good screen, nice sound, really good keyboard", "Author": "xlayn", "ReviewID": "RBMP2DS4MVPC1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "TLDR:more than you'll ever need CPU, enough ram and enough room for future upgrades up to 16GB, beautiful screen, nice keyboard, looks and feels like a expensive machine, worth the money, the only so-so component is the HDD, perform a clean install of windows 8A more extensive review:previous experience with other ASUS products:I also own a ASUS UL20FT ultra portable core i3 machine that I loveXonar DG for the deskop (love the sound it comes from it)Keyboard:This model includes an iluminated keyboard, this is a sweet detail and makes the laptop feel luxury, I love how it looks, Tron-ish if you wanna call it that way.The feel of the keyboard is also really great, for comparisson I also work with a Lenovo laptop, those laptops always get good reviews for their keyboards, but in my opinnion the keyboard on this machine has a little bit more of \"clic\" that I can't just but love.Something I don't like that much is the included numeric keyboard as it keys are a bit smaller than the standard ones, also as a side effect of it the layout of keys is a bit different than other ones, not a showstopper but it will take me a little bit of time to get used to.Screen:The screen is plain beautiful, beautiful colors, good view angles, really bright, I tilted the display as my machine sites under my main desktop and the colors are still good.WARNING WARNING WARNING BUTTTTTTTTT..... my laptop came with a dead pixel just in te middle of everything, a red one ..... it kindda bothers me but I'll keep it as I have already configured and swapped the hard disk for an SSD plus I'm outside US right now so returning the machine is way to expensive; and you have to be an ultra pixel peper to notice itIf you buy it in a brick and mortar store you may want to go to display settings set the blank screen saver and check the screen not to have any.Power comsumption:It's amazing how much efficiency we are getting from modern machines, I've see the machine running around 30watts for \"everyday tasks\" and top around 68 during the windows performance assesment, if should never go beyond 75 watts.For a extreme horsepower cpu, good video card, really nice sound system and kickass screen this is really good, for reference my desktop Q6600 with an ATI6870 can top 450watts while gamming.Windows index scorewith the Swapped SSD7.8 for memory, cpu and hard disk, 5.9 for desktop graphics and 6.5 for gamming graphics.Noise and heatHave not notice noise from the fan not even under installation or windows performance index running, never felt any part of it hot, maybe just warm under stress, core temp applications states 51c at 21c weather for \"Everyday task\" and around 65 under stress, for reference my ultra low voltage i3 at 1.3 keeps in that range most of the time.This is a silent machine, period.\"Luxury\" details:-Asus lit logo in the back-Whole keyboard surface is aluminum (or metal not sure)-The lasser etching like waves around the power and instant on buttons camuflage the speakers, it took me a while to notice were the sound were comming from.-Lit keyboard-Big trackpad-really nice sound: love it-Silent-Metal covered LidWebCam:I read somewhere in the included material that the webcam on the machine was a good low light performer and I can't but assure that's the case, it's not only able to couple with low light but also harsh light situtions, the other day I did a skype conference and I were able to notice this (room with poor light and harsh ligh in the background in another room), this is just sweet and something I did not expected.HDD:The included 5400rpm HDD will top on my experience around 60mb/s transferences through network while felling slughlish for other tasks.One of the first tasks you will have to perform in this machine if you decide not to do a clean install is remove McAfee antivirus as it's a showstopper, you will need to uninstall it and after that download an utility from McAfee website to complete uninstall.I've had experience with McAfee with several machines and it's the best not to have it, you can use instead Microsoft Security essentials.CPU horsepower:My most powerful machine prior to this one was my desktop with a Q6600 overclocked to 3ghz cpu; I always tough it was a waste of power for the standard day to day tasks but it started to show it's age on tasks like virtualization (for example hyperv will not work because a processor extension missing).This new cpu it's a total new experience, benchmark wise it's twice fast my overclocked Q6600 but under some tasks it's even faster, for example in running virtual machines, this probably to other extensions and refinement on the existing ones.Speakers and sound:The laptop includes an external speaker for bass that I find useless.The included speakers in the laptop are just great, loud, clear, you'll start enjoying running some music in the background.I have not go to the details about the specific chipset being used on this laptop for sound but I loved the sound it produced on both the speakers and my Sony V6 headphones.For reference I think is as good (minus a bit of volume) than my ipod externally amplified though an Fio e7 on my Sony V6.The only thing you'll find lacking is powerfull bass from the laptop speakers but if you keep it real you can't have that without a good subwoffer.other OS:Just tried windows 8, but in the asus website you can get the drivers for the laptop to work with windows 7Windows 8 Clean installations notes:-3 mins took the clean installation from a usb3 ADATA memory SWEEEEET-windows update will install the drivers for everything with the exception of the following drivers you should install from asus website (google: Asus N56V download)  -ATK this is the keyboard utilities  -Trackpad gestures (or something like that), you'll need to install this to be able to disable the trackpad if you prefer to work with a mouse as the trackpad is really sensitive  -if you decide to go this way you will later need to go to the windows device manager and click on update driver for the ps2 mouse this will make windows 8 recognize the trackpad as such, if not you will not be able to disable the trackpad in case you need it  -Bluetooth utility: windows can set it but the driver from asus makes it more stable, so far not a single problem with my bluetooth logitech mouseMust do upgrades:-swapping the included HDD for a SSD is a must, this is a really powerful machine and the included HDD is a botttleneck, I did install twice windows 8 on the machine, one on the included hard disk and one on a Intel X25m 120gb SSD, the install on the standard HDD were fast (around 10 min) but on the SSD it took close to 3 min, not a direct indicator of the system speed but you can get an idea.I'll update it later with:-Gamming-Wireless performance-Battery duration-Trackpad use-Some photos of the ports and layoutFeel free to make any question.", "Date": "March 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not happy at all......", "Author": "Watchlover", "ReviewID": "RV78O1JM3NCE1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop 3 weeks ago.  Upon arrival I noticed that it was making vey unusual sounds while playing videos, listening to music, etc....  I contacted ASUS Customer Support and they asked that I reinstall the audio and video drivers.  I did this and again it was still having problems.  They then provided me with an RMA number and it was sent in to the ASUS Repair Center.  I received the laptop back yesterday and it was noted in the return service form that they replaced the motherboard and the audio board as they were defective.

I did a restore to try and remedy the problems and it kept doing this so I decided that this laptop was indeed a lemon and needed to be returned.  I have now packaged it up and sent it back to Amazon for a full refund as my 30 day window to return it is quickly approaching.

So far, I'm very glad I went with this machine. It's solidly built, looks great (even my mac-obsessed friends had to conceded it looked beautiful), and runs very well. The laptop is very solidly built throughout and feels like it could take some damage.A few things that set this computer above the rest is the full 1080p display (a must for me, I can't handle how big and terrible things look on the usual 720 rigs), and the excellent Asus warranty (free accidental damage protection for a year is a huge plus). The island style keyboard is backlit and very easy to type on, and the trackpad is incredibly responsive. The best trackpad I've used that wasn't on a mac. Though they did place it a little too close to the keyboard so it's sometimes easy to accidently bump/click when typing.Another thing not mentioned in the specs, but the battery life is great. Turn off the backlighting on the keyboard, turn the screen brightness all the way down, and make sure you're using the integrated graphics rather than the discrete and you can easily pull over 4 hours of web surfing/document creation out of this before needing to plug in. Video playback will push you closer to the 3 hour mark, which is still very respectable for this powerful of a machine.The chasis itself is slightly thicker than what it looks like online (the black part under the silver is part of the chasis, don't be fooled by strategic lighting/design.

A quick jog thru the nVidia control panel (namely the 3D settings) and I was able to switch the games to use the nVidia 630M.  Minecraft, running at maximum video settings, now runs smoothly at 50-75FPS.Cold start boot time - 30 secondsWakeup time - instant onBattery life - 5 hours (stock settings would get better battery life, but I needs my graphics beauty)This laptop doesn't feel that heavy, and it is only marginally thicker than an ultrabook.  The multitouch trackpad is quite usable and not as annoying as I thought it was going to be.  The left and right buttons actually click, which I wasn't expecting.  If you don't like the multitouch input, you can turn off each touch type selectively (that way you can keep the two finger scrolling enabled).In the images for this laptop, there is a very nice dotted pattern running the top of the keyboard section of the laptop.  I thought maybe these were vent holes, but they're just painted black dots.Now, my one problem with this laptop - The Q key doesn't work at all.  Asus support wasted no time replying to the support ticket I sent over the weekend and came back with three different actions I could attempt to resolve it.  Then they provided a detailed explanation for how to RMA the laptop if I cannot repair it myself.  This is ... annoying ... as the idea of buying an Amazon Prime laptop was to have it in two days; instead, we're facing having it for a few days then shipping it back for who knows how long before its return.If it weren't for that pesky Q key, I'd have given this laptop 5 stars.  If repairs go smoothly I will adjust my rating up, but let's just hope Asus support is fast :)A warning for people who have never used high definition displays - Things get tiny.  Menus, text, toolbars, etc all get tiny.  You can adjust font/proportional settings to make things bigger, but this isn't a perfect science and websites, in particular, start getting messed up due to poor web designs.  Google Chrome also seems to have a bug where if you set the display to 150% normal it won't maximize to the whole screen no matter what you do.  Really annoying.  So!  If you have bad eye sight and/or difficulty reading small text, I might suggest you consider a laptop with a resolution smaller than 1920x1080.  You can purchase this laptop and change its resolution, but it really is built to run full HD (and it starts whining at you if you go smaller than a few steps down), and you pay more for the FHD which you might wind up not using.", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "One of the best I ever used..", "Author": "Sandeep", "ReviewID": "R1T2PQC83IV63B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me tell you a small story..before buying asus n56vm laptop on 11/28/2012 ,I bought 15\" Mac book pro without retina for $1800..second day I was facing hardware problem with 15\" Mac book pro model.so returned it..

I was in the market for a new and powerful laptop as my main home computer, but didn't have a huge budget. The N56 series were well reviewed, and the N56VZ was what I was looking for, but after some research I decided to get a N56VJ because it was a little cheaper and came direct from Amazon, not from a another seller.I've had this very nice machine for a couple of weeks. It's a gorgeous laptop and the fit and finish is pretty good. It's not put together like a $1500 or $2000 laptop, but there aren't any really noticeable rough edges to the assembly.The lighted keyboard is very good, and I'm glad to have a numeric keypad for some tasks.The large trackpad works well with Windows 8 gestures. I didn't think that I would use that much but two finger scrolling on web pages, pinch to zoom in some circumstances, and other gesture features (like showing the desktop with a 3 finger downward swipe) are nice. The clickpad seems a little hard to click, but I never use that anyway. I prefer tapping on a touchpad, two finger tap as a right click.The 8GB RAM seemed adequate but since I'm occasionally planning to run some heavy calculations on this, I decided to go to 16GB recently. I did so with crucial.com part number CT3665748, guaranteed for the N56VJ and that went perfectly, no issues.  I was concerned because of many reported issues with 16GB on the N56VZ in the past year or so, but at least that particular Crucial part is okay on the N56VJ.For those who are thinking about adding Linux, I installed Ubuntu 12.10 Secure Remix 64 bit successfully alongside Win 8. I haven't managed to turn Secure Boot back on successfully (no Secure Boot error message, but Ubuntu hangs indefinitely with Secure Boot enabled), but dual boot works fine with Secure Boot left off.I haven't done a lot with heavy graphics yet so I can't comment on the lesser 635M video card vs. the 650M that's evidently in the N56VZ.One big negative point about this (which I think at least is the same for the N56VZ) is that the power adapter is ENORMOUS. It's a 120 watt power supply, 19V @ 6.3A but still, it seems huge and heavy for a laptop power brick in 2013. This is a physically large and not featherweight laptop, but the huge brick adds an extra awkwardness to portable operation. I have tested it with a physically much smaller 19V@4.75A/90W supply I had with the right connector, and that is going well so far. But I need to drain the battery and use it while charging to see what happens there. It's not yet clear how often I will need to use this computer out of my house or apartment, so the big power brick might not be an issue at all.Anyway, the N56VJ-DH71 seems like a very nice machine for the price.", "Date": "January 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "better than expected in all categories", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1NRB58SGUOTYQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After doing research for some days I purchased this machine yesterday.

The screen is impressive, antiglare matte finish, very sharp and pleasing colors and more than enough brightness (I run it at 80% most of the time. The Keyboard is also very nice with its backlight keys. The speed of the system is impressive especially if you add an SSD like I did. I was able to get 4.5 hours of batt easyly with light use, just be sure to turn off keyboard light and turn down the brightness to 40% or less and you can get a bit more out of it. Im not a gamer so haven't tried any games but the gt635 should do fine according to the reviews online.In all a very pleasing purchase for me, I am an IT pro and wanted a machine that could handle 16gb and had power for running multiple virtual machines etc. but also had a nice display and backlit keyboard so this model fit the bill and allowed me to save some money. I cant understand why there have been so many complaints about the touchpad I feel fine with it but miss some of the capabilities I had with my previous Synaptics touchpad on my acer laptop such as the \"glide\" effect.

I emailed Asus about warranty repair (because you're not supposed to return a defective product unless it's DOA). Anyway, first email said I needed to mail it back to Asus in California but it didn't include a shipping label. I tried to reply to the email (it's not as easy as hitting reply bec you have to use their website to reply) but it was down that day - servers were busy. The second day, same thing. So I tried an online agent. I waited over 2 hours but none came online. Same thing the third day, servers busy and no online agent. Fourth day, I got to email them, response was the next day.I researched online and found a repair center near me. I emailed them again to see if I can just walk it in. They said that's not possible for this unit because only the CA center has all the necessary parts and equipment. As I was filling out the email to ask this question I called them and asked a phone agent. That phone agent said, after checking with his supervisor, that it was OK to walk the unit in for repair! I didn't know who to believe at this point so I emailed them back. Their response was, here's their phone number - call them and ask yourself.Needless to say, I already wasted enough time with the email/ phone shenanigans and returned the defective unit to Amazon. I received the replacement unit from Amazon within two days with no issues!Second unit arrived and it looks like it's a refurbished unit. Oh well.It now works great, no dead pixels, fully functional keyboard, and fast boot up.The only two problem I've really had was the wireless card and graphics card, The internet kept dropping and I would have to disconnect then reconnect to get it going again. The driver said it was up to date but a quick check on Intel's website said otherwise. I downloaded the driver update and BOOM. Problem fixed.Now, the graphics card is a new thing for me. I set it so that the Nvidia would be the primary but when I run the Benchmark on the JustCause2 game, it says the Intel 4000 card is being used. I can't seem to switch it from that.

I may be a bit biased since I've only had bad experiences with computers. But I love this laptop. I read a few reviews complaining about the trackpad placement and how some people end up deleting long stretches of text, but I have yet to deal with this. I think it's more out of how you have your hands placed and your own personal habits and whatnot because I have yet to actually deal with this problem. I do have the issue with zooming in on pages when I don't mean to but only because I'll touch the trackpad in a certain way by accident.Windows 8 was a tad confusing at first because I have literally never ever dealt with it, my old laptop was windows 7 of course, and it's almost completely different. But I am starting to grow fond of it, the apps thing is pretty cool in some ways. I was particularly excited because there's one that reads .cbr files and I download a lot of comic books, so they have a good variety of things to mess around with. I haven't had anything major happen yet, there's updates all the time. Nothing too bad, sometimes when my computer is on too long or something, some of the trackpad shortcuts? or whatever they're called, will not work. Or it might just be when I've had too many things running at once and it just lags. But usually if I just restart or leave it alone for a bit it's fine. Not a big deal since there's other ways to do the same things.I play a lot of video games, but nothing too major, and I've always just dealt with the lags and glitches and freezing my other laptops have thrown at me, but this one has literally never done any of that. I've set it up to high settings and everything and I have yet dealt with anything bad except ONE time and that was when I was downloading a major big file that was connected to the game that I was still playing it and it was barely even really noticeable. It's so nice to finally be able to play video games normally. Though I am definitely going to invest in a mouse in the near future because it's just more convenient to play any games that way.I love the island keys, it's so nice to type on. The computer is super super quiet, I haven't had any problem with it heating up too badly except once when I was playing a game for a few hours and I was in bed and the fan was kinda covered, so that was my bad. The backlit keys are awesome. The black cover for the lid is definitely a fingerprint magent as someone else stated, but I plan to get stickers and stuff. The Asus logo lights up too. There's TONS of space. I've transferred a lot of my music, videos and pictures and games from my old laptop (which was on the brink of being COMPLETELY full) onto this one and I still have so much space left over I have no idea what I'm going to do with it.Overall I'm very happy with this purchase and glad it all worked out!! I was weary because a lot of reviewers complained about certain things, but there's always going to be someone who gets a lemon regardless of what the product is.

I bought this for work (programming, data analysis, Adobe Illustrator) and it gets the job done. A beautiful screen with a great 1920x1080 resolution, which can actually display a nice chunk of a webpage, unlike the standard 1366x768. The i7 processor is incredibly fast and rivals the desktop that I built for computational work just a few years ago. The battery life is not great, but this is normal for a laptop with this much power. The extra video card (GT-630M) seems fine. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Ubuntu works pretty great out of the box with this hardware; you definitely need Bumblebee drivers to manage the 630M or it will suck up too much power.Now the negative: ASUS really dropped the ball on build quality. Lots of people are reporting the same problems. I had three:1) Stuck F10 key2) Rattling sound from one of the speakers during movies and music. Not enough to be obvious but enough to be slightly annoying.3) Touch pad sticks up a bit above the bezel.It just feels like shoddy workmanship. The speaker thing is especially annoying since the body of the laptop has an advertisement for the manufacturer of the speakers (Bang and Olufsen) etched permanently onto it. Even Microsoft is satisfied with a peel-away sticker!Even worse is that ASUS is really unhelpful. Tech support gave me an RMA, but I still had to package up the laptop and mail it to them, which costs $20 (including insurance; no way am I dropping a $1000 laptop in the mail without it). I very clearly described the 3 problems, both over the phone and on the form. It came back with only one thing fixed (the F10 key) and the other two problems exactly the same. It wasn't clear if they tried to fix it and failed, or just didn't try.I call again, and they want me to send it back again. No way am I going through that process again after you mess up the first time! At least they offered to pay for shipping the second time, although only after I requested it.Amazon was incredibly helpful with all of this. They offered either a full refund, or a free replacement. They even offered to send the replacement before receiving the old one, so that I wouldn't have to go without it for even a day. I think they've had enough complaints from enough people that they've stopped listing this item now.In the end I kept the original laptop.

And it was a weak point until I installed the SSD... even with Windows 8, things loaded pretty slowly, and certain programs did not run very well. Although to be fair, the slowness could also be related to the massive amount of bloatware that comes preinstalled (thanks Asus!). But my oh my, trying to install this SSD was one of the most annoying things I've ever tried to do with a computer.The actual physical installation of the new drive is a breeze, and I commend Asus for making it so accessible. But trying to reinstall windows on it is an exercise in frustration. Since Asus does not give you a Windows 8 disk, you either have to create/use a USB installation drive or burn your own disk. Which would be fine had Microsoft not made it so ridiculously difficult to do so without already having an installation disk! There's no way to legitimately download a windows 8 ISO for free from microsoft without a retail or upgrade product key, as far as I know. Fortunately for me, my school offers an upgrade to Windows 8 Pro for dirt cheap, so I was able to use the windows 8 setup utility for upgrade keys (not the Upgrade Assistant) in order to get a Windows 8 ISO (I tried using the product key I had for the preinstalled OEM Windows 8, but it did not work. You might have better luck, though). But even with that in hand, there are a few pitfalls along the way, like configuring the BIOS so it will recognize the drive, making sure the USB drive is formatted to FAT32 and not NTFS like the official Microsoft USB tool does, getting the product key of the installation to match the one locked into the BIOS, and so on.I'm not sure who I'm more annoyed at: Asus for not giving me a Windows disk with the computer, or Microsoft for making it so onerous to obtain a legitimate copy of the OS I already bought (indirectly) without spending more money. I don't understand why there's no way to download Windows 8 with an OEM key (I get the point of a OEM key, but still...). I understand that piracy is always a concern, but somebody always breaks through the safeguards anyway, and there are already tons of ways to get your hands on a windows 8 ISO from sources other than Microsoft. So it seems silly to fight piracy in such a way that makes it harder for your customers to use your software.As for Windows 8 itself, it's hit and miss. There are a few new changes that are really nice (new task manager, ability to pause file transfer processes, shortcuts with the windows key), while there are a few changes that are really silly, like the removal of the Start button (and the fact that Microsoft completely ripped it out of the code in order to force everyone to use their new interface). The new Start Screen is okay, though I don't understand how it's better than the Windows 7 Start menu. I don't really like hot corners or the charms bar, as I find them popping up when I don't want them to quite frequently. And I don't really get the point of desktop apps, especially since they run in fullscreen mode. Why would I want to launch a full-screen weather app when I could just quickly check the widget I have in the lower lefthand corner of my Windows 7 machine?So in summary, great hardware minus the drive, which was a lot more annoying to fix than I thought it was going to be.", "Date": "March 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Really Asus ?", "Author": "C.

Whil it is simple to open is is constantly popping open and hanging down. The plastic clip disign is poor. My only other complaint is not unoque to ASUS. All new laptops now have the (microsoft mandated) UEFI boot hardware circut, which stinks when you want to boot from an alternative USB drive, or even the CD/DVD. The UEFI Bios no longer automaticly rolls over to the next bootable device if the 1 boot devide fails. You have to go into the Bios and make (for example) the DVD/CD the primary boot device if you want to boot from it.Eventhough this Laptop is not identified as an Ultrabook, it has all the required Intel hardware (eg. Centrino chipset),  I did get Intel's free WiDi software working, for wirelessly broadcasting the entire Laptop's screen, mouse cursor, and Audio to my 62\" Panasonic TV.

The mini sub adds *a little* more depth to your sound but don't expect earth shattering bass from it, or much of a sound quality enhancement at all.

One of the things I love about the screen is that it's viewable for a lot of angles, so if you want to show someone something on the screen you don't have to tilt it at just the right angle or stick your tongue out or have them get right behind you to see it.The build has been really durable and solid. The laptop bag it travels in is a barely padded messenger style bag and it's been sufficient.After 9 months of use for an average of 5 hours a day, it still charges well, the hinges are still in good shape and the display is still beautiful. If I buy him another laptop as a present, it will probably be another one in this same line.", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome laptop!", "Author": "Robert Shaw", "ReviewID": "R26WW8I9NQCWF1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The specs on these babies are awesome for its price.

Its weight isn't too little, but compared to my dell inspiron 17 inch laptop, this is a piece of cake to carry around.The only down side of have to this computer is its spotty wifi at times.

Backlit keyboard is a plus. The only gripe I have is that the trackpad buttons are not separate from the trackpad itself. This makes it cumbersome to use the buttons, as you cannot for instance, rest a finger on the button as you move the mouse around. Also, if you lightly tap over the right mouse area (without actually depressing the button), it will be interpreted as a left click, which is also strange. Having the mouse move slightly when I go to press a mouse button is also annoying.

I thought I'd just write a short review on it.The good: Screen and sound quality are excellent.  I underestimated how nice a 1080p screen would look.  I mostly use my earphones when I'm listening to music or whatever, but the speakers are really quite impressive for a laptop.  Performance is great.  I was coming off a 3 year old Gateway Windows Vista laptop, so I've been really happy with how fast this is.  Battery life is great.  Keyboard is great.  It is surprisingly lightweight.  Intel core i7 is top of the line, Nvidia Geforce GT635M is probably mid-range or less for gaming.The bad: Wifi has a tendency to drop in and out (though I may need to just download a new driver).  Touchpad is quite weak, but is irrelevant if you use a mouse like me.  I had a big issue when I downloaded the latest Nvidia driver.  It apparently did not work with Windows 8 and I had to refresh the PC to factory default settings.  Luckily I was able to keep all my files.  Speaking of Windows 8, it's not that I don't like it, but it's not all that special.  I can tell it is really meant for tablets and not laptops.  The solution to that is to use desktop mode all the time.Bottom line: 4 out of 5 stars.  I didn't give 5 out of 5 because the issues I've had thus far have been mildly frustrating, but for the most part it is an impressive laptop.  I hope it lasts me for a good three years (maybe that's too hopeful the way technology advances these days).  If it does I will definitely buy ASUS products in the future and recommend ASUS products to anyone I know.", "Date": "May 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Yowser!!!

I do not notice anything used. 2 bags were open, but the contents looked untouched. As for the computer, well I got worried when I read some reviews. I purchased before reading the bad reviews. I trusted the brand and Amazon since I never had a problem with either. So far everything is great. Computer is very fast and I was able to run secondlife on ultra, the highest setting. My previous computers could not run it past the low settings, so this is a huge improvement. The sound is way better than I imagined it would be. Couple of minor complaints. The touch pad does work, but like others said, it is really in the way. Its easy to touch it while you type and suddenly you are typing somewhere else. But I noticed there is a way to turn it off and I will. I also noticed some popping noises, quiet, but noticeable from the speakers when I switch between some functons. But I just updated the drivers and I havent noticed it agan yet. Keeping my fingers crossed. I'm hoping I will be able to upgrade this review to 5 stars. I will review again if anything changes. But so far I am quite pleased. [EDIT 5/23/2013] Been a few weeks now and still no major problem. Just the popping noises from the speakers which may be normal.
