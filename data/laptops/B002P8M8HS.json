I was shopping on black Friday, have heard great things about Toshiba laptops, and they had this one for 499.00 so I said what the heck and got it!  I also ordered a wireless router.  A few days later the box came and I could not be happier.  The best thing about is the the display.  It is very sharp, bright, and clear.  The keyboard is nice as well.  I can't stand the touchpad, but I think that's a common problem with all laptops.  I immediately went out and bought a wireless mouse to use with it.  The sound is not great either, but again, I think that's common with laptops. It seems pretty sturdy, and runs cool.  It does not get hot, and the fan doesn't even run when the ambient temp is around 65 degrees.  Setting up the wireless network was a breeze, and when I started up the laptop, it found the signal immediately, and never loses it.  The computer is very fast and I have not had one problem.  Very satisfied..and wow what a great price I got--this is a well equipped laptop.", "Date": "December 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Wish it had an HDMI output", "Author": "D.

It has not disappointed me and at the price ($499) for the specs (4g ram/500g HD)it has been the a great machine.One plus with this machine is that it came with very little \"bloatware\"- Norton trial, Microsoft Office 2007 trial, and some games. So, if you buy this machine at a \"Box Store\" don't let them con you into optimization for an extra $50-$100, you can do recovery disks and bloatware removal on your own.The only downside is I really wish it had an HDMI output for streaming movies to my flat screen from places like Amazon, but the VGA or USB output will have to suffice.No HDMI is only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, other machines in this range offer it and hope Toshiba will soon.", "Date": "December 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent!

I got one of these on Black Friday for my son, and just ordered another for myself. I love Win 7! There is very little preloaded crap to remove and it is super fast. Having the numeric keypad on the side and an amazing screen add to its sheer awesomeness.  The touchpad is ultra cool.  I must agree with other reviewers that the sound is lacking, but I did not purchase the laptop to be my primary music player so I still gave it 5 stars. I was shocked when I first closed the laptop, being used to ones that latch. This one doesn't latch and the tension hinge (which keeps it closed in lieu of a latch) wants to slam shut in the last few inches, whereas those that latch have to be pushed all the way closed.  It survived that rough close and my 1st Toshiba, four months old and running great for my college student, survived a 3 foot drop onto carpet.

West", "ReviewID": "R39JPYG42JK3RF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this machine 2 weeks ago to replace an old personal eMachines laptop, I use an IBM Thinkpad for work. This computer stacks up nicely compared to all the other laptops I've used. First, the screen is very bright and vivid. I love the number pad, it's great not having to hunt and peck for the numbers across the top of the keys. Without a doubt, the memory and RAM are great at this price point. Unfortunately, I didn't get the great deal some others did, but even at $579, it's still a good value. I've already loaded up my iTunes and other applications and it runs smoothly and quickly. It was a breeze to set up.The only draw back is the touch pad, as others have mentioned. When I bought it, I'd read some reviews that pointed to the frustrations this thing caused, but I figured people were just being picky. They weren't - it stinks. First it's a bit hard to see, but that's not such a big deal. The real issue is the application. I've gone in and adjusted the settings every which way possible, I can't get it to function as I want. I ultimately turned off the tapping function (way too sensitive at every setting) and I'm still not happy. I find myself using the pad and it randomly adjusts the zoom level of the screen. I've no doubt that this issue can be resolved with some setting, but I can't find it.To summarize, the touchpad is bad enough to take away 1 star, but the pros far outweigh this con, especially if you use an external mouse. Do your research, you probably won't find a machine with this much to offer at a similar price point.", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "love my new fast laptop", "Author": "S.

I like the desktop wallpaper option that allows you to make it a slideshow of as many pics as you want in different time intervals. this computer boots in mere seconds which is awesome compared to some computers that take up to 10 minutes in some cases like my moms dell desktop which is so underpowered its crazy. she bought it on a home shopping network channel. trust me thats a bad idea on buying computers. anyway my computer is very fast and i like windows 7. its also HD so you can watch movies online or HD youtube videos that are available in HD actually in HD. only one complaint. when watching a streaming movie on DIVX it does have an issue with not completely stretching all the way to full screen on DIVX windowed mode when connected to a widescreen television. at least the one tv that i tried it on. thats not a huge complaint though as I dont usually use this computer for movie watching connected to a tv. I will be using it as my mobile internet laptop for work and elsewhere on the go. I also will be upgrading this computer to 8 gigs of ram although it really doesnt need it as it really is a fast computer but hey its going to get even faster. I love that it can be upgraded to 8 gigs.UPDATE: its only been two or 3 weeks now but now my internal speakers do not work. I redownloaded the sound driver from toshiba but they still do not work. the headphone jack works and external speakers will work to but it sucks that the internal speakers that are on this computer decided to stop working so quickly.

Actually Battery life is very acurately estimated!  This is a true exception to the rule with laptops I have used in the past.  They will state x number of hours of battery life on a charge and normally last about half of that time.  This Toshiba states 2 hours and twenty five minutes, but it actually lasts that long!!

Jones \"fly guy\"", "ReviewID": "R3SZFF61V6B3OC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After months of contemplating to purchase a new laptop to replace my old Dell latitude D600 I finally pulled the trigger. I purchased this one 3 days before Thanksgiving from Amazon. The initial purchase price was $579.99. Before it even arrived I went back to review my purchase the day after Thanksgiving and the price was now $499.99! Being a bit peeved that I just paid $80.00 more for the exact same laptop 3 days earlier I wrote and requested a refund of the difference. Amazon wrote me back and tried to make me feel guilty by saying they don't have a price guarantee but since it was just 3 days that they would go ahead and refund the difference, which they did and of which I really appreciated. The first laptop arrived and died over night! I contacted Toshiba to try and figure out why Windows would not start and was instructed to send it back. I contacted Amazon and they immediately sent a replacement.So far this laptop has been working flawlessly.  The Windows 7 is lightning fast compared to XP. It boots right up from a cold start and shuts down fast. The wireless antenna picks up connections from all over the neighborhood. Connecting to my wireless service was a snap. The battery that came with the machine was a bit weak. It didn't seem to last very long so I purchased a 9 hour battery direct from Toshiba which holds a charge for a long time. The 9 hour battery is rather big and bulky but it beats dragging around a cord. The only thing I am not too thrilled about is the speakers. They seem rather puny, I can hardly hear them. Overall, this machine and Windows 7 is a huge upgrade for me. If it lasts half as lond as the Dell did I will be happy.I would like to add that my experience with Amazon has been outstanding with this purchase.

I bought a laptop from them this summer, and within 3 months, it stopped powering on.  Per Toshiba's warranty, you MUST send it in to their \"repair depot\".

The \"repair depot\" has diagnosed the problem 3 times so far, and each time it waits on a part for an average of 2-3 weeks.

It was good for maybe a year, but as of late it's been crashing non-stop and depleting itself of battery in less than an hour. Its main issue is video. If you're thinking of watching HD youtube or just simply anything of finer quality, don't even THINK about getting this product. It freezes, turns black, and reboots with a green screen over the thing you intended to watch with a warning message. This flaw has been present since the laptop was fresh out of the packaging. Even if the video is not HD, or played on WMP, it will has a significant amount of lag and force you to watch things at 50%.If you like making videos yourself, don't get this product. I have Sony Vegas 8.0 installed on it, and it won't get as far as an 8 second render time before flashing a message that the system doesn't have enough memory and crashes. This is when I have 223 GB free of an 287 GB drive.There are also technical things that have been disappointing. One of the USB ports has stopped responding. The sound quality is tinny, and barely audible at its highest volume without headphones. The paint on the left click has completely worn off and looks hideous, and both clickers and touchpad have gone completely disoriented in the past to where you couldn't use them. The battery will only last you a little less than two years. The glossy screen also causes bad glaring.Its redeeming quality is that it gets the basic job done, which is writing and looking at stuff of the internet. Its gaming capacity is poor, and its video capacity is even poorer. If you're someone dependent on digital media like me you're better off tossing this thing out a window.

It died January 2010.Our second was purchased July 2006 and was lightly used as my home computer until Jan 2010, when it became my husband's work computer (needed XP).  It is still doing quite well, especially considering it's over 4 years old.This being our third Toshiba, we were expecting it to be reliable and of good quality and are not disappointed.  It has given no problems during the 9 months we've used it.  The only downside is the speakers - they are so quite!  I have googled solutions and work-arounds to amp them up, but they remain noticably quieter than we prefer.  We are fairly quiet people and would set a computer in one corner of a room and play I-tunes, which would softly permeate the first floor of our house.  On this computer - sounds are barely audible in one room.  I sometimes watch a movie while going to sleep (alone in a quiet room) and will often catch myself 'turning up' the sound - after it had already been set as loud as possible.  Next laptop will have Harmon Kardon speakers.Although sound is important, this factor has been the only downside of this laptop.  I really enjoy using Windows 7, having a ton of memory and having a super fast start-up/shut-down.  The laptop's durability surprised me recently when we were puppy-sitting, puppy accidentally popped off 3 key tiles.  I figured they were ruined, but after studying them for a second, all 3 perfectly snapped right back on.We made a great decision in buying this laptop and hope we are able to use it for many more years.", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great for all-in-one Laptop, but don't count on the speakers", "Author": "L.

I bought another not because of any major problems with the old one, but simply to have Windows 7 on a nice, new machine. Toshiba does a great job in the mid-range laptop market. It's lighter than I expected, came with an expanded keyboard and a wide screen perfect for movie watching. While the Satellite handles video well, comes with a built-in microphone and webcam--sound is a major issue. If you like to use your laptop as a music player, definitely invest in some speakers because the ones in the machine are inaudible from a different room or with even the slightest background noise. Aside from the sound issue (common to many laptops), I found nothing to fault in the Satellite. Windows 7 is a definite improvement over XP and the screen is capable of high-resolution video. Battery life is shortened due to the size of the screen and computing power. I can go over two hours without a charge, more in economy mode.

Got the HDD failure warning late one night, the next morning the laptop died.  No chance for data backup so the next option is expensive data recovery.  I expect the HDD to last longer.

I decided on a laptop (and in particular this laptop) for several reasons. The first reason was the freedom a laptop offers. This beats both the desktop and the all in one.The second reason was the ability to connect it to my television. Again this beats both the desktop and the all in one. Just so you know, my wife doesn't consider a desktop to be suitable d\u00e9cor for the living room.These positives outweighed the negatives. For one thing with a laptop, all your eggs are in a basket that could be dropped or forgotten on the subway. Also, if the LCD screen goes bad you're likely to drop some serious cash on replacing it.The biggest negative I feel toward laptops is the keyboard and touchpad. The laptops I occasionally use at work have scrunched up keys, and no number keypad. Also, the touchpads need to have their itches scratched in just the right way or they don't move the cursor the way you want them to.In deed, the first step in choosing this Toshiba was going to the big box store and practicing typing on all the models with number keypads. I made the least number of typing errors with the Toshiba. After that, I looked at the features and the price. After that, I read through the reviews and finally, I decided to buy it from Amazon.After using this laptop for nearly a month, I'd have to say the more I use it, the more I love it. I do have minor annoyances with the touchpad. Probably every laptop has this issue and I guess I could mess around with the sensitivity and such, but it's not such a big deal to me.  It's really cool to watch a movie instantly on my laptop or hook up a VGA cable and watch it on my flat screen TV.The last little nick I want to mention is the fact that when I first got online with this laptop, I noticed it slowed down and eventually stopped working. I shut down the computer and immediately saw the problem. There were 10 Windows updates! I could not (and dared not) stop the installation process. The first 4 updates took nearly an hour to install; the rest took about 20 minutes. I couldn't use my computer for nearly an hour and half. It's a bummer when you have a new toy and Mr. Softy doesn't let you play with it.I struggled with the decision to give this laptop 4 stars instead of 5. I truly love this machine, and I highly recommend it. The minor annoyances of the touchpad and a batch of updates for Windows are certainly not unique to this machine, none the less, they do detract from an otherwise stellar machine.", "Date": "March 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "very good laptop", "Author": "F.

Young \"Zachy Boy\"", "ReviewID": "R25R6GT5M707X0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Good laptop, good features. Runs fast, nothing to complain about. The only issue with this laptop was the hard drive prematurely failing. Within 1 year, the pc started displaying bizarre behavior, much like random slow downs for extended periods of time among other uncommon events. After talking to technical support about this laptop behavior, they recommended I do a full reformat with the recovery discs. Having used recovery discs to do a full reformat and reinstall of Windows 7, the computer again behaved properly. Some short months after this fresh complete reformat, Windows started to display a message in the system icon area regarding hard drive failure probability. I thought this was an insignificant event and thought it was just Windows being over zealous with reporting errors and failures.After receiving these hard drive error messages for a short time, I decided to use Windows built in error checking tool and used the recover bad sectors and fix system errors options. Still having error messages pop up regarding hard drive failure, I decided to do use the error checking tool a few more times over the next month or so as this was all I could think of.Starting up the laptop one day, it suddenly does not want to boot into Windows. It displays an error message after posting, but before completing the first Windows animation. The laptop no longer boots into windows at all after these events. In the error message, it displays options to discover exactly what was wrong with the pc, I go through the process and among the mumbo jumbo as some say, the conclusion it states as the root of the problem is a Bad Hard Drive Disk.After doing this test multiple times and getting exactly the same message and conclusion. I decided to contact Toshiba again. At first contact, they decided to move my issue up to their Case Manager as they call them. They said I would receive a call back within 3 business days. Four business days roll by and I call them back, after discussing the issue with them they decide to tell me that they don't know what caused it, it could have been my fault, and they chose not to do anything about it, even after me politely discussing them what option I might have. Not even me sending it in to them so they can diagnose it at the least, nothing whatsoever.The hard drive failed within 21 months from the date of purchase, I bought this for my parents and all it does is sit on a table not being used all that much.The most disappointing thing about this encounter with Toshiba is the fact that not only did they refuse to offer any possible diagnosing whatsoever, but back around 1990, Toshiba Corp was sued in a lawsuit involving $2 Billion dollars regarding their knowledge of selling faulty equipment, which involves laptops as well. This information was put in the news by the New York Times as well as others. From my experience with them, they were very unsympathetic.The hard drive it came with was a Toshiba brand hard drive 500GB, I had replaced it with a smaller 250GB Western Digital model as that was one of the cheapest I could find at Best Buy. This unnecessary repair had cost me $60 out of my pocket for a defect Toshiba refuses to even consider offering any help whatsoever. I now understand why Toshiba was sued for $2 Billion dollars, I wouldn't expect them to care for their customers anymore after that kind of loss.
