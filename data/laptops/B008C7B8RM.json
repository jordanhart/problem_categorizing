Now, generally I'm a mac guy, but I wanted to start playing pc games in my free time and traded to this. Games Like the new Tomb Raider, and Bioshock Infinite look unreal. I didn't even know laptops could produce graphics so powerful. Of course the 256 ssd drive is nice too!

I received it, and while updating it, the motherboard ended up getting fried by a failed BIOS flash.Well, they had no replacement 4545s' in stock, nor a replacement motherboard for it.  Instead, I was offered a 8570W as a replacement\\upgrade.I could not be happier.  I have had this laptop for a few days now, and it is spectacular.  It is nearly as powerful as my desktop that I built for $2200 in 2010, but uses maybe 1/5 the power.  Of course, the GPU isn't quite on par, but I am happy that it even has a standalone GPU, rather than just a CPU\\GPU combo like most non-gaming laptops.", "Date": "September 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop", "Author": "Ken N", "ReviewID": "RO79ASW8H6UO7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Early versions of the laptop had issues with the motherboard and/or video card. Laptop would reboot on its own 5+ times per day when I first got it. HP sent out a tech and took a few visits but eventually they replaced most of the parts for free due to the onsite warranty and since then it has been rock solid.", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "terrible, terrible support", "Author": "Roger M. Cooke", "ReviewID": "R17E9Q84D70P3G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had very bad experience with the computer and with HP support. After 4 months I began receiving warnings that the hard drive had a serious malfunction. It was never dropped or mishandled. HP product support immediately sent me a new hard drive - blank. they promise to send the windows 7 OS. With my technical people at my work I tried to mirror the HD to keep my software. Nothing worked. Of course a blank HD without software is worse than useless. The software on my laptop is LATEX, MATLAB. MAPLE, PHOTSHOP, etc etc. It takes days or weeks to re install it all.  HP technical support blithely informed me that hard drives were supposed to fail. I asked for the manager. He was very sorry that I was having problems and advised me to go on line and purchase mirroring software and try to mirror my HD. If you want to pay top money for this kind of performance and support, purchase from HP", "Date": "February 7, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "HP COMMERCIAL SPECIALTY B8V82UT#ABA 8570W I7 3610Q", "Name": "HP EliteBook 8570w B8V82UT 15.6\" LED Notebook - Intel - Core i7 i7-3610QM 2.3GHz - Gunmetal", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EK2hKphbL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008C7B8RM"}}
