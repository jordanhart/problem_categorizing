{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Well built gaming laptop", "Author": "Rogerdon", "ReviewID": "R2XQJ2876B0C0A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my Aorus for three months now and overall I'm really happy with my purchase. I'll cover some highlights and ignore the Windows operating system, just a necessary evil here.Portability: Not what I was needing this laptop for and I wouldn't expect anyone to think they'll be toting this behemoth around with them often. It's built really solidly and with that you get a good amount of weight. My reference for portability is my Macbook Air and these two laptops feel like opposites on the portability scale. This should compare more to grabbing your desktop to take over to your friends house for gaming parties and in that comparison this laptop is extremely portable. It's also a good bit lighter than competing 17\" laptops available so comparing to my Macbook Air isn't fair.Touch Pad: The touch pad is one of the low points for me. Again my reference here is my Macbook Air which has a fantastic touch pad that offers nearly no friction and is easy to click. The glass touchpad isn't smooth at all, it's very difficult to slide your finger across it and clicking it takes too much effort. I seldom use it as I imagine most users will also opt for a gaming mouse to accompany it.Keyboard: The keyboard is fantastic, everything is well laid out and macro keys are thrown in as a nice bonus. I couldn't imagine there is a better keyboard available on a laptop, it's really that good.Temperature and Noise: The fans do their job without being too distracting. When under full load running Everquest Landmark the fans keep the laptop cool and noise is as you'd expect from fans running.Performance: Everquest Landmark is still in Beta and not optimized for the SLI configuration. I still get a solid 30fps with normal settings. I'm expecting once the game goes live and SOE offers SLI optimization I can run at full graphics quality with no problems.17\" Screen: The 1080 screen just doesn't impress. I don't think it's necessarily bad it's just not up to par with the high rez screens we're expecting now. The good thing is that it's easier to run games at this rez so it's not an unnecessary load but don't expect to be wowed by the screen.Overall I'm happy with my purchase and I recommend this to anyone looking for a gaming laptop.", "Date": "May 24, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$2,099.00", "Features": "Intel Core i7-4700HQ 2.4 GHz\n16.0 GB DDR3\n1024.0 GB 5400.0 rpm Hard Drive, 256 GB Solid-State Drive\n17.3-Inch Screen\nWindows 8.1", "Name": "Aorus X7-CF1 17.3-Inch Laptop", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41v17XhPsuL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00ISKS49S"}}
