{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Mighty Mouse of a Laptop", "Author": "DGG \"DGG\"", "ReviewID": "R2HETUXSPN5RCZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My IdeaPad (Lenovo) Y450 is a little mighty mouse.  It is officially a Lenovo IdeaPad 41892AU model.I'm still amazed that Lenovo (and other manufacturers) can pack such a complete computer package into such a small laptop shell for such a reasonable price.  I'm not a laptop expert but here is my take on this little beauty.Mine came with Vista Home (I transferred/upgraded free to Win 7) and a variety of other software titles including the usual 90 day trial stuff from Norton and Microsoft Office.  It has a very good 14 inch backlight HD LED display screen, a nice keyboard touch and layout, tons of connections (for a mouse), good sound for a laptop, and the capability to run any software available today.Mine came with 4GB of 204-Pin DDR# SODIMM RAM, the max for any 32 bit operating system.  The motherboard has a 2.1Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo processory #T6500 with a bus speed of 800MHz and 2M gate.  In other words it cooks right along.  It has a dual layer DVD, Dolby Home Theater premium audio system which is nice for movies, etc.It has this face recognition password system which allows you to sign onto the system by just sitting in front of it.  That save a few steps and provides good security.  The tiny camera is located at the top of the lid.It's physique is thin and light, 1.4\" and a little over 4 pounds.About the comments of the touchpad being sensitive I have found in my experience that any laptop touchpad is twitchy.  That is why I use a $10 wireless mouse, and find things go much easier.In summ, I think this laptop offers a great bang for the buck and I would recommend it for someone looking for a good general use computer/laptop at a decent price.", "Date": "March 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop for a general use not for Gaming.", "Author": "N.

A very nice 14 inch screen with hd 720p. So now I can watch the slingbox on hd. I read the previos review from other webside about heating proablem but it never heat to me maybe they fix the proablem since the laptop come out last year.And some pepole complain about wifi connection but the lenovo fix the proablem the new order computer come with all fix problems. If you by this computer last year I hear that you have to go on lenovo webside and download the softer.Sow far I am verry verry happy with this computer. I wish the buttons were with lights like apple mac pro. The rest it's a good computer but if you are into the gamer online you better look for some other computer with the better video card.Soon I will post a video review on a [...]", "Date": "February 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not bad, but could have been better", "Author": "peoplebites \"peoplebites\"", "ReviewID": "R3GYPK1TIIVE9C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is an older laptop, launched originally in 2009. The device is fine for a budget laptop, with excellent speakers (probably the best I have ever used/s in a laptop).Battery becomes unusable after 3 years. The power cable connector is giving a bit of trouble too. The components used aren't the most reliable...I guess.However, for regular use (non-gaming), this laptop is just fine.", "Date": "January 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unreliable & bad quality.", "Author": "K.

Bought it around 2+ years back and the motherboard died on the first week; lenovo did not give another system, but replaced the motherboard. After 6 months, the wireless adapter stopped working; after 18 months, the battery died. Now the DVD drive is making sounds and does not work with CDs.Pros: the system has very good speakers. Yet to find another laptop with better audio.", "Date": "June 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Aweful product.", "Author": "Newbie", "ReviewID": "R1H6ARG7QVHEIW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Buying this is like buying a lotto.After half a year, this junk simply fell apart:  A couple of keys quit working, plug gets loose.  Then, hard disk fell.  Now the cooling is shot.  It gets really hot.  And the hinge broke.  The nasty warranty rep is scolding me like it is my fault.Dont buy ever from them again!PS. I have bought a few others from them and without any glitch so far.  But you happen to get a junk, you are screwed.  I think they have a real problem with quality control.  They should not have let this junk out of the door.", "Date": "December 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Over-heating and broken wi-fi.", "Author": "J. Guo", "ReviewID": "R2FFM7WNL67YI4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Ever since I purchased this laptop in August 2009 there has been a problem with the heat sink and fan. It would randomly shut down (and I mean suddenly the machines dies) and therefore losing lal my work. I sent it to warrenty and they said the heat sink was the problem so did the appropriate replacement. Soon after, it would still become very hot and this time loud as hell. 2 years later, the wi-fi went out and I cannot even watch ore than 10 minutes of Netflix on this thing without it shutting down on me. I have purchased a wi-fi adaptor to compensate and waiting for the harddrive to die so I can justify purchasing something else. I had a Toshiba for 5 years throughout college and it never gave me any issues. Oh, and on top of that, if you order a Lenovo via their website, you will likely have to wait for weeks or months before they can ship one out to you.Other than that, I like the white keyboard, patterened outer case, and the touch volume control.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Terribly Sharp Edge", "Author": "Kuppahallil Phaneesh", "ReviewID": "R2JMYNCHVMI58I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The edge where you rest your palm is so sharp that it almost cut my hand on my first day of use.

As I type this review, accidental near-brushes of my fingers over the touchpad make the cursor jump back up to the middle of other sentences and I am constantly reshifting. I can't figure out why it jumps back and forth all the time, in text and in web pages.
