Before this I had the HP T2z which is the predecessor of the TM2 series. I've had it for a couple weeks now and thought I'd share my opinion.Pros:- FN keys are first laptop functions then F keys: I love this feature. I very rarely use function keys but I do use the volume / brightness / WLAN keys a lot. This new keyboard layout makes the function keys laptop functions by default. You have to hit the FN key to use F11, for example. But the wireless on/off is a touch away.- Screen flips both ways: the T2z could only rotate one way. This goes both.- Long lasting battery: with the wireless off and the screen half bright I've gotten 6+ hours out of the battery.- Light: nice to have the weight down. Who wants to carry extra pounds?Cons:- No home, end, pg dn, pg up keys: The new keyboard has it's downside... I use the home end keys a lot, or used to at least. Since we're talking about the keyboard, I don't like the feeling. It's got that clakety-clak feeling of the old keyboards. You feel like you have to be rough with it for the keys to work. It's not very sensitive either.- Fingerprint reader on side of screen: this is a horrible design flaw IMHO. Is your screen ever in EXACTLY the same angle? Well think of trying to do a straight line on a tilted screen. Or better yet, think of trying that 4-5 times to get a proper reading.- Eraser in onenote: I love the new pen with an eraser. However, Onenote doesn't like to recognize it as an eraser. Not HPs fault I guess, but I bought the tablet to use with onenote.- Touchpad: it's got the new touchpad that had the built in buttons like a mac. Not to keen on it.- No DVD drive: this could be a pro or a con. Depends on how you see it. I very rarely use my drive, but for that 10% of the time, it is VERY necessary. However, it's weight and battery for something I use only rarely.So, there you have it. Would I buy another one? Most definitely. I love my touchpad PC.", "Date": "November 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "HP TouchSmart tm2-2150", "Author": "Rahmad24", "ReviewID": "R2634WGZVYWK9P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TouchSmart tm2-2150us to replace my old Sony Vaio.Pros:- 500GB storage- 4GB memory, 2GB each slot (expandable to 8GB)- Intel i3 1.33 GHz (Works fine for image editing)- Convertible screen (iPad killer)- Sensitive Touch Screen- Pen digitizer- Unique design- Nice speaker outputCons:- a bit heavy (~4.1 lbs)- reflective display (need to set maximum brightness if you use it outdoor)- no optical driveSo far, this laptop meet my expectation as a portable and tablet PC.

I really vacillated between getting an iPad and the HP.  The tm2t beats the Apple hands down. Fingerprint-securtiy logon, I/O-phone jack, RJ45 for ethernet, HDMI-out, VGA-out, 3 USB's, an SD-MS/Pro-MMC-XD-card slot plus a security-lock port.  The intel-i5 plus 4Gb runs superbly and doesn't kill the battery as an i7 does. It boots quickly, runs fast, tough-as-nails and stays cool -- is a blast to use. The screen is beautiful--very easy on the eyes.  The 180\u00b0swivel/fold back touchscreen is an awesome feature. Built-in webcam and great little speakers (Dolby Advanced Sound) round out the features.As another reviewer noted, the *finger* sensitivity varies, I find it has to be \"awakened\".  But once you have its attention, it performs flawlessly.  But the tm2 also comes with a pen mouse which is *very* accurate.  You don't even need to physically touch the screen--it responds when the pen gets within an inch of the surface.  Battery life is great--I get 6 to 8 hours easily with screen at 2/3 bright (which is all you need unless you're outside).  Everything is faster with this beauty--even downloads seem 3x faster. I would recommend Win-7 Pro, but you can upgrade anytime.  Just don't forget to order an external DVD/Blu-Ray R/W unit.", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very happy!!!", "Author": "i8a4re777", "ReviewID": "R1B452SK8174I4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this computer for my wife to use while she is going to college.  We both could not be happier.  She enjoys the ease of use and the fact of how light it is for her to carry.  It was just like the company put in their ad that it was unopened and new.  Very easy to get things started on it, easy to connect to our home wireless network and the use of the light pen is wonderful.  We are very satisfied with the product and look forward to ordering from this company again in the future.", "Date": "February 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "it is a little piece of heaven", "Author": "amberstar", "ReviewID": "RMN6GXIEGP4AX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is the best laptop i have ever owned..it is wonderful and portable, and i can even take my math notes on it..people may think it is a disadvantage it does not come with a dvd drive but you can get one for a great price here on amazon..this was a great investment", "Date": "April 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R350YYICZD2JJR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop because my other laptop doesnt work all the time.

I was waiting to see if they would make one with a larger touch screen then decided that a larger one would not be pratical. I am very pleased with this purchase.  If you want the ability to hand write things and draw or make graphs I would recommend this computer. It is a very good computer. Lightweight and just large enough to do alot of things.

Works both with Windows and with a quick-boot ROM-based OS that gives you the minimum browser and such.

In some motels it would work but in most it wouldn't, both the Windows and quick-boot modes.  I've tried to configure it every which way with no success. It finds the network fine, shows good signal strength, but fails to connect to it.

The touch screen is incredibly laggy and unresponsive, often actions must be repeated 2-4 times. The stylus is much better, but no picnic either. The fingerprint reader is a joke.

I had been looking for a tablet PC to use in classroom teaching as well as for personal computing, and after some search decided on the HP. The HP screen has limited, ipad style touch sensitivity which I did not need anyway (and prefered to not use and have to wipe the screen every so often). It is, however, a great tablet. It is fast enough with 4 gig ram and its bright screen has beautiful color and contrast. The stylus, or pen, comes with a tether that attaches it to the machine's body (a must have) and works fine. Coupled with Microsoft OneNote my initial goals for classroom teaching were realized without much effort to learn and implement basic operations (I had never before used either a tablet PC or the OneNote). This is the kind of product that quickly gets the nod of approval. Other than the nice Argento design which gives the machine distinctive nice looks, its battery life has so far performed to specifications and is the best among laptop batteries I have used before, except possibly for the one in my MAC. The only drawbacks for me are: (a) the keyboard which is missing some useful buttons like Home, End, PgUp/PdDn and has hard to work with insert/delete, and (b) the HP software that came bundled with the laptop, most of which has to remain idle and slows some operations, not to mention that a lot of it seems to be best suited for use by children. Now that HP is terminating its consumer PC products unit it is not clear what will happen with regard to updates, support etc in case someobody does use these. If it were not for these drawbacks then my rating for this machine would have been five stars. I do not have any regrets so far and would recommend this computer to those who need a tablet computer with a convnient physical keyboard and solid, traditional computing features rather than an ipad. In particular, I have found my computer quite useful for classroom teaching as well as for professional powerpoint, pdf or other types of presentations in a room with a projector properly wired for PC connection.", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "I love this thing!", "Author": "Gregor", "ReviewID": "R1S6LC5BM8UR9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:> Very responsive styluse.  You can even hold it over the screen and it acts like a hovering mouse to provide pop-up information on most applications and web-sites.> Excellent picture quality.  One of the main reasons I bought this was to show off photos.> Runs Photoshop, WAMP, Chrome, and Microsoft software as fast or faster than my desktop.> The VGA and HDMI ports both work fine (in contrast to the ASUS touch screen netbook I used to own.)Cons:> There is a feature that rotates the screen 180 degrees when you switch from laptop to tablet mode.  HP thinks I want to use it with the battery at the top, which does give it a nice tilt when placed on a desk.  However, I find it more comfortable to hold with the battery at the bottom.  So when I switch to tablet mode I have to hit the rotate button twice.  It's just an annoyance, but you would think HP would have made this feature configurable.> Touch detection goes to sleep after just a minute and you have to hold the stylus or your finger on the screen for a few seconds to wake it up.  However, I found a work around on an Internet forum; go to the device manager and turn off the USB power shutdown feature.I was burglarized in February and lost a 17\" laptop, which was too heavy to take anywhere, and touch screen netbook, which was too weak to run most applications.  The HP TMP2 replaced them both.  It's powerful enough to be my primary computer, light enough to carry around, and has the great tablet feature I love to use when sitting around the living room or showing photos to my friends and family.It is hard to believe HP stopped making this.", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "NICE AN FUNCTIONAL", "Author": "A.
