So glad I did.  The screen is large; the HD is clear and bright; the camera/microphone is great for Skyping with my family.  I'm even getting accustomed to Windows 8.1.  I just love the feel of the keyboard.  I could go on and on.  But I won't.  It's great and glad we popped for it.", "Date": "May 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice laptop", "Author": "Stephen Dunklee \"bookgeek\"", "ReviewID": "R1L4CVBYI4EOX0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Played the Wildstar beta for over 4 hours sunday and the laptop didn't even get warm. while two asus computers an s53sv i7 2670-qm with gt540m graphics, and an Asus g75vw ROG both got hot enough to make toast. Not dissing the asus computers they are real powerhouses. I was very impressed It played the new game smoothly at the same settings as the other computers.", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "samsung 8.1", "Author": "LINNEY", "ReviewID": "RKHHWZK3V3Q9K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great price for this computer, first time using windows 8.1 and I like the apps and you can use the window 7 desktop as well.

No, its not ideal, and I prefer to game on my FX-6300 with 760GTX4GB, but I can play my favorite basic games on here without lag, like any SOURCE games, Starcraft 2, Dawn of War, ect...Now, the gentleman here asked how to increase the performance of this laptop. I made a couple of modifications...  - Add 4GB more RAM, cost me 34 dollars for another stick of 4GB DDR3 1600...its great that this computer comes with a single stick and an empty bank, this helps greatly because 512MB is reserved for video, now youll have 7.5GB system ram.  -Replace the hard drive...I cant even begin to tell you how much faster this laptop is with the SAMSUNG 120GB SSD That I purchased for 70 dollars to replace the 500GB 5200 hard drive it comes with. Toss a 64 or 128 GB SD card in the slot up front if you need more storage. 128GB is more than enough for me to have my OS with all my favorite apps, a few games, all my software, and 50 Gigs of free space for swap and messing around.  - Change BIOS settings to regular BIOS boot instead of UEFI, and install a FRESH copy of Windows 7 (we all \"have\" copies if your competent)So all in all I paid ~480 dollars for a laptop that hasan a6-5200k next gen quad core AMD processor with Radeon 8400 APU8GB DDR3 1600128GB Samsung EVO Solid State Hard DriveWindows 717.3'' LED Backlight 1600x900 Display with HDMI outputAn actual DVD Burner (useless, but a feature non the less)USB 3.0Need I say more?Boots in 15 seconds.R()X()R JEWS", "Date": "May 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Toshiba 17.3 \"", "Author": "Karen", "ReviewID": "RTIKHOEYQCY9O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love my new Toshiba laptopIt arrive 1.5 days after I ordered it!
