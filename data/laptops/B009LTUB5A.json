I've had it for several months and the only complaint is windows 8 - which isn't dell's fault. It's high powered, doesn't have any hang time when surfing the web, using photoshop, among other programs being open at the same time. It runs cool (which seems to be a first for me), and is a great computer i7 - can't go wrong.I've had no issues with it whatsoever. Years ago I had trouble with installing hardware into a Dell. Either I had a bad machine back then or they've gotten better. Everything runs smoothly.

Has less features than similar machines in it's price range - it lacks an SSD for the OS drive, doesn't have a back lit keyboard, and the keyboard lacks a numpad and feels cheap.The wireless on this model shuts itself off frequently, you either have to toggle airplane mode to get it back, or simply update the drivers (not the Dell provided ones), and then go in and shut off the ability for the system to put the card to sleep to save power.The screen is a bit too flexible; opening the screen from the sides will have you worrying about snapping the screen in half. I'm sure it's fine, but it does worry me often.This was my second choice in laptops, my first choice had more features for the same price, however Dell provides great self support for drivers so I can swap the OS for Win 7, or Linux and not have to spend days searching for drivers. This support, and the 1 TB drive are far more valuable to me than the missing features.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very fast and convenient", "Author": "MasterReviewer05", "ReviewID": "RVQZ7WYWFMK25", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use this computer for pretty much everything.

Either way tho it shouldnt be happening. I tried sending it back but Amazon doesnt give full refunds for laptops that have been opened and used (tell me again how I'm supposed to know a laptop works w/o turning it on?). The dell customer service sucks too. Honestly the computer isnt the worse but I'd recomend getting a sony or samsung at an actual store, not online. And your honestly fine w/o upgrading to Windows 8. It isn't that amazing. Just go with 7 and upgrade later, save a 100$.
