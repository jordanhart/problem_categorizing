While I am happy with the condition of the laptop (it arrived as advertised and in original packaging), the 13z's design is definitely inferior to the 14z.  It is not just the screen size:  the 13z uses a Alps touchpad for which the responsiveness is very poor.  Scrolling through a website is painful because the touchpad does not respond immediately -- unfortunately, I found that others have this complaint only after I made the purchase.  The USB ports also seem flaky -- sometimes my wireless keyboard is not detected, but works in another port.  Were I able to do it again, I would spend a little extra to get another 14z or something else entirely.", "Date": "March 1, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00CIBWV8I"}}
