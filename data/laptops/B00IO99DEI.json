It's just the right size for backpack or briefcase. I love the touch screen for easy navigation. I like to use an external mouse and it has plenty of USB ports that I can use for mouse plus I can charge my iphone at the same time.This system is super quick and takes less than a minute to power up or to shut down at the end of the session. I love the battery as it will hold a charge for several hours so I don't feel chained to a plug.The only downside are the fingerprints left from using the touchscreen, but the pros outweighs the cons. I got some pre-moistened individually packaged screen wipes and they come right off.It was worth the little extra I paid to get the touch screen.", "Date": "June 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worst Computer.", "Author": "Orthodoxy", "ReviewID": "R1DT83U2PO1B9S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have returned this computer.  The troubles I had with it are too numerous to mention.  It froze up on me quite often, would not scan photos, & I could not import my music downloads from Amazon Cloud Player (the last straw!)  Neither could my email be forwarded from Yahoo.  Plus, it's backed up by Microsoft.  I had to call tech support twice just to get registered!  Bottom line--just don't buy it!", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00IO99DEI"}}
