because of the move to the new Intel processor, \"Ivy Bridge.\" The 2.9GHz Intel Core i7 dual-core processor just makes this MacBook Pro fly. And it runs much cooler than its predecessors. I had my laptop running while on my lap for a couple hours and the bottom case was barely warm. Fan noise was not noticeable whatsoever. To be honest, I don't even know if the fan was operating or not, it was that quiet.The aluminum  unibody case has remained pretty much unchanged for several years. In fact, my previous MacBook Pro, a 2.4GHz Intel Core 2 Duo with 4GB of RAM has the identical case that this new laptop has... it is designated as Model No: A1278 if you look at the bottom of the laptop case.What Apple threw into the mix, which made my decision of which new Apple laptop to purchase more difficult, was the addition of the Retina Display MacBook. Initially I was tormented with making the correct decision of which computer to purchase. After I weighed the differences and factored in the cost, it became clear to me that for my use, the 13\" MacBook Pro was the way to go rather than an Air or Retina Display MacBook Pro. Here are my reasons...-The Retina Display MacBook lacks an optical drive. For me, that was a critical feature as I am a Mobile DJ and still rip a lot of CD's to my computer. I did not want to have to carry around an external optical drive so having the internal optical drive on the new MacBook Pro was key.-The Retina Display MacBook does not have an Ethernet port. Again, this won't affect all people, but for me it was an essential feature that I use all the time. I wasn't ready to give up my dedicated ethernet connectivity port.-The Retina Display MacBook was priced out of my comfort zone. It's a phenomenal computer but I just could not justify the price.-The Air doesn't offer the disk space that I need nor the right combination of ports.Honestly, the display on the 13.3\" MacBook Pro is gorgeous. I can see where a photographer might enjoy the Retina Display, but for me, the 1280x800 resolution of the screen on this laptop is perfect. The display is bright, very bright, sharp and has excellent viewing from side to side. I'm a little conflicted with the glossy screen, but I think I have grudgingly accepted it for the most part. In most situations I find it nicer than a glare-free screen. For some situations however, it is not the best because of the reflections on the screen of surrounding lights and such. You must remember that while reducing glare on a screen might make it easier to view in certain situations by reducing reflections of light and surroundings, by its nature the anti-glare will reduce sharpness of the screen image. By having the glossy screen you have an amazingly bright, clear and sharp image that is just beautiful to view.I had also considered getting an early 2012 refurbished MacBook Pro. That was my second-best option. But for the small difference in price, I would not have gotten USB 3.0 ports and that was important to me, as well as getting Thunderbolt. Admittedly, there are not yet many peripherals that utilize Thunderbolt or USB 3.0 but that is certainly going to change quite rapidly. USB 3.0 is 10 times faster than USB 2.0 and offers throughput of up to 5Gbps.  Thunderbolt is even faster and allows daisy-chaining of monitors and other devices. This new MacBook Pro also has an upgraded facetime camera. It is now 720p HD and that's pretty awesome.Firewire 800 is still included on this MacBook Pro. Undoubtedly, Firewire is getting towards the end of its lifespan but many videographers are still using video cameras that use Firewire and I also have external hard drives using firewire, so this is still useful for me.The newly added Tunderbolt port is also useable as a mini-display port and you can easily obtain adapters to enable you to hook up to DVI, VAG and HDMI. I do miss not having a dedicated HDMI port, but at least it is possible to get an adapter to fill that need.The Lion and soon to be released Mountain Lion operating system has garnered a lot of comments both positive and negative. Personally I have not experienced any issues with Lion. The integration with iCloud is fantastic and allows me to keep my contacts, address book, bookmarks all in sync across all my devices (iMac, iPhone, iPod Touch and another MacBook Pro.)The iLife suite of applicatons included with the computer are excellent. iPhoto, iMovie and GarageBand are tightly integrated and work well. There is room for improvement, to be sure, but I use iPhoto and iMovie all the time and it is an amazingly capable duo.If you're considering a MacBook Pro for the first time and are coming from the PC world, welcome. You will have a little adjusting to do but it's really easy and you will probably be impressed with how straightforward the operating system is. It just works. I can't even think of when I had a crash or freeze.I've not yet reached the 7-hours mark for  battery life, but still, I've been getting at least 5 hours plus so no complaints.If you are considering the new MacBook Pro and you're already a Mac user then you will welcome the addition of a much faster processor, the addition of Thunderbolt and USB 3.0.I am really liking my new MacBook Pro and with 8GB of RAM, and the new i7 Processor running at 2.9GHZ (turbo-boost to 3.6GHz) you will be very happy with the performance.Regarding the 8GB RAM memory maximum for this MacBook Pro, it is interesting to note that Crucial sells a 16GB RAM kit for this particular model. Despite this, Apple does not acknowledge that the computer will accept 16GB of RAM. I called Apple Technical Support to ask about this and I was told that even though the computer may accept 16GB of RAM and seem to run without any problems with 16GB of RAM, the full amount of RAM may not actually be used by the MacBook Pro. It's kind of hard to say what the implications are of adding 16GB of RAM when Apple says the maximum is 8GB for this model. What will happen though is if you have any issues with the computer and Apple discovers that you've put 16GB of RAM in it, you could be denied service under the warranty. So I guess I'd be happy with 8GB of RAM until this issue gets more clarification, either by benchmark tests that show an improvement in performance or a firmware update or some acknowledgment from Apple approving the option of 16GB of RAM. I\"d like to think that if Apple wanted to make as much money as possible that they would offer this computer with an 16GB option. Since they don't, there must be a technical reason why.I've been using a protective case for my MacBook Pro and I recommend it. It's priced very fairly, comes in a variety of colors and has worked really well for me. It even lets the Apple Logo shine through the case. Here is a link to the Red color version of the case. RED iPearl mCover\u00ae Hard Shell Case for A1278 Aluminum Unibody MacBook Pro 13-inch (RED color)UPDATE: July 1, 2012 - I've been reading reports online about the fact that the new Retina Display MacBook Pro has pushed the graphics handling capabilities of the computer to the max. This has resulted in some problems that are only just beginning to manifest themselves, such as sluggish screen draw in some situations, slow frame rates in other situations and image retention issues.In other words, by pushing the limits, as Apple frequently does (and I'm not suggesting that that's a bad thing) early adopters are paying the price. So I'm feeling even better about choosing this particular model rather than spending significantly more for the Retina Display MacBook Pro and having to deal with the first generation issues.UPDATE: July 5, 2012 - Note to PC users considering the switch to a Mac. Don't be intimidated to switch. Mac OSX is a fantastic operating system and not difficult to learn at all. But there are definitely some subtle differences between the PC and Mac user interface and experience. I would strongly suggest getting a good book such as Switching to the Mac: The Missing Manual, Lion Edition. It's an excellent overview of what you'll need to know regarding the Mac experience and the Lion operating system. I use both Windows 7 and Mac OSX and own both a PC laptop and Mac laptop and desktop machines. I consider Macs to be my primary computer because of my familiarity with them and their ease of use. However, a helpful book will ease your transition and eliminate the guesswork.UPDATE: August 24, 2012 - I've upgraded my OS to Mountain Lion, 10.8, and have been running it for about 2 weeks. I have not noticed any issues and the upgrade went very smoothly. Some of the new features are great. I particularly like the dictation feature that lets you speak while in any application that accepts text input and the MBP will automatically and accurately convert your speech to text. The new way that messages are handled is very similar to IOS and I like it. Some users are reporting less battery life but I have not noticed any degradation in battery life on my comptuer.", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Loving it!", "Author": "Spencer Atherton", "ReviewID": "R3H4T4E7OE0ZDA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is not my first Mac computer, and certainly will not be my last. Before I begin, I will say that I am not like a good percentage of the people that will end up writing a review on this computer - I am not an Apple fanboy. I have owned many PC computers as well, and like them too. I currently own a Lenovo laptop as well as my new MacBook Pro, and each have their own strengths and weaknesses.To start with the strengths:1. OSX Lion is a great performer..extremely fast and reliable. I have it installed on my iMac desktop computer as well and love it. Not to mention this comes with a free upgrade to Mountain Lion, which is very nice.2. Screen looks great. Even though it is not the Retina display you can get on the 15.4 inch model, the screen is fantastic. Very bright and crystal clear with excellent color.3. Quietest laptop I have ever owned. Keeps quiet even when the computer is under a heavy load.4. First computer I have owned with USB 3.0. I bought an external hard drive when I purchased this laptop as well so I could utilize the USB 3.0. I got the hard drive yesterday and transferred all of my files from my old laptop to the new hard drive so I could put them on my MacBook. It took about 1/5th of the time it did with USB 2.0.5. My Lenovo laptop does not have an illuminated keyboard, so the keyboard on this laptop is a big plus in my opinion. Excellent for people that like to work or surf the web while their significant other is sleeping.6. The trackpad - can't even compare it to any trackpad I have seen on any other laptop computer.7. Excellent battery life while being a very fast performer. It definitely has the best of both worlds. I average about 6 hours on a charge. My Lenovo (with similar graphics, processor, etc. and same use) only lasts about 4 or 5 hours on a full charge.8. Typical Apple simplistic styling. I love the look of the Apple products. Simple and clean.9. Many, many more...but those are the most notable ones to me.Now, for the weaknesses.1. The only thing I dislike about this laptop are the rubber pads found on the bottom of the computer for grip. They may get softer and more sticky as time goes by, but right now they are far from that. The pads on the bottom of my Lenovo are definitely much better and don't allow the computer to slide around while I am using the computer on a glass topped desk.2. Price - it's a bit pricey for the performance you get, but the added perks of Mac OSX and the durability and support of Apple products makes up for it. For the same price, you can get a PC with more memory, larger hard drive, better graphics, and a faster processor, but then you remember you're running Windows 7, which isn't nearly as well built as Mac OSX.In conclusion - this is a great laptop. Although it is a little pricey, it is well worth the extra money. So far, the only issue I have with it (rubber pads) is a very small problem that does not change how this laptop performs in any way.If you are thinking about getting a MacBook Pro laptop but do not want to spend a huge amount of money for one, this is definitely the way to go. It may be considered the \"base model\" MacBook Pro, but it still an excellent computer. The size and battery life of this computer makes it excellent for people that need a laptop that is very mobile. Between work and college classes, I needed a lightweight yet durable computer and this definitely fits that criteria.9.5/10", "Date": "June 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "macbook air 13inch vs macbook pro 13inch", "Author": "intrimitido", "ReviewID": "RVJ43DY1SH9JK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this review is about my personal honest experience, i am not a computer wizard.like most of you, i had a hard time thinking which one to buy, an air or a pro. what i did is purchased the two and see which one will better suit my needs and send back the one that I won't like. so I went at my local best buy and did so. after using both products for 14days, here are my thoughts.the macbook air looks very beautiful on the outside. it's so thin and light and can be used anywhere like a tablet. to sum things up, the MB air is more of a fashion statement than a work horse. is it faster than a pro? yes only by 10-15secs during start up. the audio quality sounds thin but loud. the pro has a deeper sound. air has higher resolution but the fonts are small. what I hate about it is the screen display color. macbook pro by far has more vivid colors and if you love to watch netflix and hd videos like me, the pro is a better choice. i like the design of the air but i'm sorry to say that it is more like a toy than a real life laptop. if you have a main computer, the air is a very good addition but if you only need an all in one computer like me to take with you, store data, watch videos, do picture and video editing and plan to use for a very long time, then the macbook pro is a better choice and for me is more sturdy. one reviewer says that the air has better screen display but I don't agree with that because i am an amateur photographer and im pretty sure i know which has the better display. in the long run you will be needing that dvd drive, the storage and ram that you can customize, the ethernet and ports that are already built in and most of all the screen display. the macbook pro still looks stunningly beautiful and is a more capable laptop. even the keyboard is better to type on. the air is super light weight but the pro still is light. we still need to use our muscles sometimes. battery life are identical 5-6 hrs.I got more from my money on the pro and it is a better choice for me that's why I kept it and sent the air back for a refund. again this is just my personal honest opinion.", "Date": "March 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Surprisingly unimpressive compared with new MacBook Air", "Author": "Farb Dannon", "ReviewID": "R2688UMHBW3YHE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased the newly updated 13\" MacBook Pro and the newly updated 13\" MacBook Air the day they were announced at WWDC and released for sale in June 2012. (My 13\" MacBook Pro is the 2.9 GHz i7 model, and my MacBook Air is factory upgraded to a 2.0 GHz i7 processor and 8GB RAM.)After using the two machines side-by-side for a couple weeks now, I can say that the MacBook Air outperforms the MacBook Pro in almost every task and in terms of overall speed and performance. Compared with the newly refreshed and updated Air, the new MacBook Pro is frankly a significant disappointment, and I've pretty much stopped using it altogether in favor of the faster Air. Despite the Air's slower CPU clock speed, it performs faster than the Pro in actual tasks due to the performance boost afforded by it's SSD hard drive. The SSD drive on the MacBook Air makes an enormous difference in everything from casual web browsing to video editing.If you're debating which 13\" MacBook to buy, the 13\" MacBook Air or the 13\" MacBook Pro, here's a side-by-side comparison...Speed and Performance: Advantage MacBook AirApart from the hard drives and port configurations, the technology inside the machines is virtually identical in both the newly refreshed MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. Both Pros and Airs come with either i5 or i7 Intel \"Ivy Bridge\" processors, Intel HD Graphics 4000, USB 3.0, and lightning-fast Thunderbolt ports. While the MacBook Air models are at a disadvantage to the MacBook Pro models in terms of CPU clock speeds, any performance disadvantage from the processor speed is more than made up for by the lightning fast performance of the Air's SSD hard drive, which Apple markets as \"Flash\" storage. In everyday tasks from gaming to web browsing to watching Flash movies and editing video, the MacBook Air is faster significantly faster in virtually every task. The Air boots up in less than 12 seconds while the Pro takes upwards of one minute.Screen: Advantage MacBook AirIf you've never used a MacBook Air, much less the new Retina display 15\" MacBook Pro, then you won't notice just how outdated the MacBook pro's screen is. However, once you get used to the super high resolution 1440 x 900 LED display on the MacBook Air, the 1280 x 800 back-lit LED display on the MacBook Pro looks downright grainy and primitive. Simply put, once you get used to a higher resolution display, the 1280 x 800 display on the 13\" MacBook Pro just isn't acceptable. Even for simple tasks like email or word processing where you wouldn't think the resolution would matter, the graphics look grainy and pixelated, which just isn't acceptable for a pro-level laptop in 2012.Upgradability: Advantage MacBook ProThe Pro's only major advantage over the Air comes in terms of the flexibility of its hardware, ease of repair, and upgradability. With only a screw driver and about 10 minutes of your time, you can add more memory to the Pro, replace the hard drive, and even add a second hard drive in place of the optical disc drive. The Air, on the other hand, is stuck in the configuration you purchase it in except that you can opt to replace the SSD \"Flash\" hard drive with a higher capacity SSD drive.Design, Weight, Portability, Battery Life, and Form Factor: Advantage MacBook AirThe MacBook Air is the most beautiful computer ever produced by man, and the MacBook Pro looks like it's older, pudgy relative. The Air's aluminum case is impeccably designed, almost tailored to accommodate the necessary internal components, while maintaining practical ergonomics. It's an incredibly thin, svelte, sexy little notebook. The MacBook Air's aluminum case seems sturdy and durable, and its mechanics are very similar to the time-test unibody construction of the MacBook Pro. The MacBook Pro, on the other hand, is a bit of a dinosaur in its bulky circa 2006 unibody. The Pro is heavier than a half gallon of milk at 4.5 lbs, while the MacBook Air weighs in at less than 2.9 lbs. Battery life is roughly even on both machines at anywhere from 4 to 7 hours depending on workload and settings.Summary Judgement: Buy the MacBook Air (or opt for the new 15\" Retina display MacBook Pro)Simply put, the guts of the MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro are basically the same, but the Air's SSD hard drive gives it a tremendously significant boost in performance. Sadly, the MacBook Pro's 5400-rpm hard drive leaves the machine unable to capitalize on the newest, most expensive Intel \"Ivy Bridge\" i5 and i7 processors that you're paying a $300 premium for in the newly updated Pros. If you are going to buy a Pro, invest the extra money and get it upgraded with a SSD hard drive and get an extra external hard drive if you need additional cheap storage space for multimedia files. When you also consider the superior display, lighter weight, increased portability, and lower price of the MacBook Air, it's hard to find a reason to justify purchasing the current 13\" MacBook Pro, which to me looks like a dinosaur rapidly headed for extinction.Specs on the models compared:13\" MacBook Air (mid 2012) factory upgraded to the 2.0 GHz dual core i7 processor and factory upgraded to 8 GB RAM (1600MHz DDR3L SDRAM) with standard 256 GB SSD (\"Flash\") hard drive13\" MacBook Pro (mid 2012) with 2.9 GHz dual core i7 processor, 8 GB RAM (1600MHz DDR3L SDRAM), and 750GB Serial ATA Drive @ 5400 rpmBoth feature Intel HD 4000 Graphics, 3.0 USB, Thunderbolt, 802.11n, etc.", "Date": "June 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Simply the best computer I've ever used... with one possibly irrelevant issue", "Author": "Elizabeth A. Schauble \"Azunai\"", "ReviewID": "R3BX8E2I17GA4P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used to be a die hard windows fan. I was always bashing OSx for the usual things (too expensive, too dumb, et cetera, et cetera), and I never really gave it a chance. Windows 7 was my OS of choice from the day it came out, and I used it on many different computers with (or at least what I thought then) good results. It's certainly not a bad OS but...This past holiday season, I got an Asus tablet PC. I wanted to love it, I really did. I gave it a five star review here on Amazon, and I tried my very hardest to use it to it's fullest potential. It was working fine for a while, until I tried the Windows 8 beta. It was all down-hill from there. Viruses, problems (beyond those that should be in a beta, and a general ugliness drove me absolutely insane, and I decided to move away from Windows, at least temporarily. I bought a Chromebook, and while I absolutely love it and highly recommend it, I wanted more out a computer than it offered.So, nearly on a whim, I bought a Mac. I have never made a better tech decision. Literally everything about it is better than any computer I've ever used, from the operating system to the hardware.People typically say that the real reason they love Macs and other Apple products is because of the build quality. While the build quality on this computer is INSANELY good (I feel bad hauling it around with me; I feel like it should be in an art museum), I really think it's the software that makes this a standout computer and computing experience. I've had absolutely zero backround in OSx up until now, and already I am easily finding my way around this computer. Granted, I've had a good backround in Linux and OSx is similar, but the fact that I'm easily navigating a brand new operating system after only one day is quite the contrast from Windows, now that I can look at it objectively. OSx Lion is wonderful. The multi-touch gestures and the multi-touch mouse itself are immensely helpful, and it's because of features like these that make it clear to me that it's almost necessary for a company to make the hardware for a product if they're making the software as well. Everything works extremely well together.Like I said, the included apps put Windows to shame. With the exception of Outlook (which I personally hate, but my Mom has a Mac and can't stand the contacts App and uses Outlook), I can't think of a single, rational person who would pick Windows software over Apple software when it comes to things like media, photo/video editing, and email. To be perfectly honest, it's ridiculous how well all this stuff works. I downloaded the iWorks office suite (which is not free, though significantly cheaper than Microsoft Office), and they also work like a charm. I really don't create a whole lot of spreadsheets or slide shows so I can't guarantee a qualified opinion on Numbers (Excel) or Keynote (PowerPoint), but the Pages app is lightyears ahead of Microsoft Word. I also downloaded Logic Pro 9 (an music synthesizer/recording studio app) after having used it with friends a few months back, and have spent hours digging into another fantastic piece of Mac Software, and I can say for a fact that it is truly unparalleled in the Windows world.The actual hardware internals of the computer are amazing. The new Ivy Bridge processors whip through anything I can throw at them, and the 8 gb of fast (1600 mhz) ram makes multi-tasking a breeze. The nVidia graphics card, while not a show-stopper, is completely adequate for some heavy-duty video editing in something like Final Cut or Photo Shop (though I haven't used Photo Shop in about a year now, so I'm not COMPLETELY sure about the latter of the two statements), or gaming (whether you dual-boot or pick one of the games from the increasingly impressive OSx catalogue). The speakers, while not mind-blowing, are much better than what I'm used to from integrated laptop speakers, and the screen, even though I opted for the non-HD screen, is very good; colors are bright and saturated, the pixel density is more than satisfactory, and the viewing angles are some of the best I've ever seen. Battery life is as good as advertised, and the computer starts and runs much more quickly than I'm used to, especially considering that this computer doesn't have flash storage.I haven't run into a single thing I would change about this computer up to this point. I love the software, I love the hardware, and I love my decision. If you're in the market for an exceptional, powerful notebook, look no further. I can't recommend this computer highly enough.Edit: While the great things that I mentioned about OSx are all still completely viable and even after several weeks (months, perhaps?) of heavy usage I haven't experienced any problems. Mountain Lion is a great update and even though I don't own an iPhone or an iPad (I'm more of an android guy), I still like almost all of the additions it brings to OSx.However, I have since installed Windows. Bootcamp is a marvelous program, and in about 20 minutes I had Windows 7 working great on my computer. All the drivers were installed and performance was great. Once I actually started playing games though, several design flaw were suddenly extremely apparent to me, and they were apparent in a very bad way.I'm not sure if Windows is just a more demanding operating system or if a fan driver was left out of my Bootcamp install, but the cooling of this computer when doing ANYTHING intensive under Windows is absolutely atrocious. The unibody design is gorgeous. It's revolutionary, it's stylish, it's classy, and it has major practical issues. The vents are hidden under the hinges of the screen, and anything but the most perfect of screen angles will block off much of the fans output. Even with the fans blowing full blast at nearly all times while running Windows, the computer gets extremely hot during usage. I use a laptop as a literal \"lap\" top computer frequently. This works fine under OSx; it's impossible under Windows. The bottom of the computer gets painfully hot during heavy usage (to the point where I literally can't touch it for more than a few seconds), and the metal area (ironically) around the \"wasd\" keys gets extremely hot as well. I've had the computer completely overheat three times only in the past two weeks. Since I only play online games, this isn't a real issue, but I can't imagine what would happen were someone actually doing something important on a Windows partition and have the computer overheat and shut down. Even with good ventilation (meaning smooth granite surfaces and a laptop stand specifically designed to enhance ventilation), there is no avoiding an extremely hot computer and constantly whirring fans.Long story short, I'm very glad they improved the fan design in the Retina Display Macbooks, because it is, frankly, very, very poor here.I'm conflicted on whether I should change my overall rating of the computer though. Even though Macs are equipped (through Bootcamp) to run Windows, they weren't designed to do so, and I certainly haven't had a single issue while running (the far superior) OSx. Considering the fact that I should be basing my opinion of the product on its own merits and not on those of a competing product, I don't think I will change my overall scoring. I do think it is prudent to add, however, that cooling while running Windows 7 is terrible. If you NEED Windows, stick with a Windows computer. They will most likely handle Windows better than this one will.", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Used item being sold as new", "Author": "sinclairvoyant", "ReviewID": "R2XQ1JNF39YUKH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I just want to issue a warning to people who purchase this product trying to save a bit over Apple prices.

Let me start off by saying that I was highly reluctant to spend so much money on a laptop. I've always been a Windows guy so I've known that you can buy laptops with equivalent specs to Macs for a good deal cheaper. Though after comparing different laptops I was not able to find one that had  a satisfactory build quality. The closest I could find were laptops made by Asus, but even then I read of too many build quality issues that made me uneasy. Ultrabooks made by other companies had good quality, but by then they cost just as much as the MacBook but with lower specs.  So I decided to take the plunge with this MacBook after demoing it in a Apple Store. Here are the things that made me confident with my purchase:Build Quality - Seriously, you can't beat a unibody construction. While other laptops creak when you pick them up due to the various plastic components screwed together, the Macbook feels firm. The only thing that initially concerned me was that the lid would slightly creak when you closed it. Running waxed dental floss through the hinges solved this.Trackpad and Keyboard- This extra large trackpad is heavenly to use. Having the whole trackpad function as a giant button is a lot more comfortable to use. Plus two finger clicking as a replacement for the right click button is surprisingly intuitive. The keyboard keys are well spaced and the led backlighting is very cool.Power System - I regularly get around 6 hours from the battery, which I am more than satisfied with. The magsafe plugin system is more handy than I thought it would be, and there is a neat led battery indicator on the side of the notebook that makes checking the battery level with the computer off easy.OS X - Mine initially came with Lion, but after upgrading to Mountain Lion I am even more satisfied. Everything runs fast and animations are fluid. I love the multi touch features, which again is something I initially didn't think I would really need. It took me a little time to get used to using finder after being accustomed to windows explorer, but I am confident now in my ability to navigate through files just as quickly as in Windows.Dual Booting - I have a few engineering programs that only run on Windows so I decided to install Windows 7 through bootcamp.  Because it boots natively from the hard drive, it runs just as smoothly as any other Windows laptop. Remember folks, this computer doesn't have any magical internal components. The Intel Chipset is the same used in any other laptop and thus Windows runs just the same with the proper drivers installed.Chipset - The Intel Core i5 runs very fast with minimal heat. The Intel Graphics 4000 is more than adequate for most applications.I could even run Portal 2 on maximum graphics settings and play 1080p video without it breaking a sweat. The fan almost never revs up to an audible level. This is in part to the aluminum body being a giant heat sink. So yes, the laptop body can get warm at times. But it is never uncomfortably warm when I use it on my lap. Ill probably upgrade the RAM and the harddrive to an SSD in the future, but for now they are fine.So all in all I am very happy with my purchase. I am officially a Mac convert and will use this laptop for a very long time.Also, all the Windows \"gamers\" who are trashing Macs need to gain some perspective. Yes, I can get a Core i7 laptop with a dedicated graphics card for a lot cheaper than the MacBook. But I decided to spend the extra money to get a better engineered laptop with some nifty extra features.", "Date": "July 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "DON'T BUY THIS, IT'S NOT A NEW ITEM!

Added an iMac about 2 years later. Then, switched back to primarily PC for work on a HP Envy 14. I also took some time to build a sweet gaming PC rig. And now, after selling the iMac (not really used since college), the gaming PC and the HP Envy 14, I have hopped back onto this MacBook Pro 13 inch.I'm very glad to be back on an Apple product. Having used PCs exclusively for the last 2 years, I can identify a few specific reasons why I wanted to get back to Mac.1) Mouse mechanics - there is really nothing in the PC market that compares to the Mac trackpad. The closest alternative to its smooth, accurate and conveniently place functionality is the Lenovo ThinkPad's red nipple. Since I work often where having to pull out a separate mouse would be inconvenient, this was an important point for me.2) Battery life - even new, the HP Envy only hits 3 hours or so on a full charge. I can squeeze close to 6 hours out of the MBP. Trips on the road make the doubled battery life very useful.3) Lion productivity features - I remember having to use a second monitor on my PC setups just for the real estate. i can honestly say that I am fine without that now when able to swipe between desktops with 3 finger motions on this trackpad. Having a second monitor anyway is a bonus now that lets me just keep iTunes or Outlook open on the side.4) Speed - Lion and the upgrades I've added to this MBP (listed above) have made this computer incredibly fast. I can crunch through 500,000 row Excel spreadsheets, update my iPhone firmware, and watch a 720p YouTube without any noticeable hitches. Startup takes less than 10 seconds, waking from start is instantaneous (so awesome and useful!), install speeds are zippy.5) Prettiness - beautiful work machines can inspire better and more creative work. It does more than just make me want to use the MBP more - it's a constant reminder of how careful planning, bold design choices, good engineering, and hard work make inspirational products.Clearly I'm a fan. Still, I'm going to deduct a star for three reasons:1) Price - it's expensive for the components inside. The price essentially values the Lion OS X and integrated software/hardware at something like $200 over similar Windows systems.2) Fragile aesthetics - the aluminum frame scratches a little too easily and the glossy screen picks up fingerprints/oil. I'm babying the hell out of this MBP, which means taking off my aircraft aluminum watch before using it and wiping its screen down about once every other day.3) Glossy screen - screen glare makes working in sunlight basically impossible.", "Date": "July 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Counterfiet product", "Author": "MARIANO MUSSI", "ReviewID": "RC3RCV89ECK1V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was dissapointed by Amazon.

And at first I was thinking I was going to get something like a i7 with dedicated Gpu windows computer. But I am glad I didn't!FOR ALL WINDOWS FANS, first of all I want to share that I do not hate windows since I game on my windows desktop that I built myself.But my experience with windows laptops has not been the best. Always had miscellaneous problems with video drivers, screen, touch pad you name it! But I thought to myself that hey! at least I have really good spec laptop. Wrong! once I switched to mac all those things seemed unacceptable! I have now noticed that apple really take their time making their laptops and quality is there as well! Now here are some of my reviews of the specs.Cpu- although its a dual core it has more than enough speed for everyday useGpu- although its a integrated gpu it has more than enough everyday power for regular use. (unless your a gamer, or need the dedicated gpu for high demanding work) , which a lot of us do not need for college.Hard drive - this is the one thing I am considering upgrading for the 5400 rpm speed to a 7200 rpm hard drive since it is a cheap but effective upgrade for boot times and opening apps.Ram - this I am not even considering upgrading since this ram is fast and 4GB is more than enough for everyday use. The only reason I would upgrade is if I would be running many apps at the same time.Screen - although some people might complain about low res which I think is ridiculous. I will also say it is much better than I expected! Since the contrast of colors makes it seem so crisp! I would go as far as saying the colors and contrast is better than some pc laptops with higher res screens.Cooling design- I also think this is better since MB's do not has fans under and on the sides where when you have it on your lap it will suck in a considering of dust. The mac-book's cooling system is made in a way where you can actually consider it a LAP top.Other things like DVD-RW drive was my deal breaker to get the non-retina pro since I need it.Also the network plug is a plus since if you do not have reliable wifi it will come in handy!Back-lit keyboard which also was a must and is am glad to say it is very good.Speakers- are the one thing I miss from my windows laptop. Since these are loud enough if there are no loud obstructions near you, but do not let throw you off because they are fine for moderate noises for example: at starbucks.Touchpad- this is the most profound thing that makes any other touchpad inferior and make it feel way ahead of it's time! Makes web browsing a breeze and switching either from windows, to desktop or anything a breeze!This laptop is light enough to carry in your backpack the whole day. Has a nice aluminum finish, but I considered getting a sleeve and case to ensure I would not damage or scratch it.If you need the extra performance I would strongly urge you to get a 15\" MBP since they have the added dedicated Gpu, i7 Cpu, and better speakers.If you need a windows operating system for a app then I would urge you to partition your hard drive for both os systems since you will still use mac os much much much more!All in all many people (like me) think they need a high spec laptop for school which is not true!

My previous MacBook allowed replacement of the internal battery in 10 seconds, with no tools.2)  OS 10.8 is definitely \"dumbed down\" as compared with 10.6.  10.8 now has \"Windows like\" hidden files (this can be disabled).3)  \"Bounce\" has been removed from the Apple Mail program.  \"Bounce\" is a great tool to let people know you don't want any further e-mails from them.

Though friendly, Apple Care was far from truly helpful. I looked up online and found that this is a persisting and common problem with Macs. Apple refuses to admit that there is a problem and maintains that even though there are thousands of bloggers with their own angry stories. Macs are sold and marketed as a business and school laptop... but it fails miserably since it cannot be relied upon for a business transaction or a online test (my sister bought the same one and has the same problems... she prays every time she takes an online exam it doesnt disconnect).

It's ideal for FaceTime chats and VoIP applications.The FaceTime camera in the top bezel supports full 720p HD.While the battery life is rated at 7 hours, my time averages about 5 hours, but it recharges very quickly.I'm a fan of Extended Warranties like the well-known AppleCare, which allows you to take your computer to your nearest Apple store and let the Geniuses take care of the rest. I opted for the SquareTrade 3-Year Computer Accidental Protection Warranty ($1500-2000) which also support \"accidents\" like drops and spills that are NOT covered by AppleCare. Unlike AppleCare, though, it's a mail-in service with a 5-day guaranty.All of that's great, but to really soup it up, I upgraded the RAM to 16 GB with something like the Corsair Vengeance Laptop Memory Kit 16 GB (2x8 GB) DDR3 1600MHz CL10 PC3 12800 (CMSX16GX3M2A1600C10). That's a quick upgrade that even a novice can do in under 30 minutes. You'll need a small phillips screw driver and a nylon pry tool. If you're going to do any upgrades such as RAM or hard drive, I recommend the NewerTech 11 Piece Computer ToolKit. It contains all the various screw drivers (phillips and torx) needed for Apple devices and 2 nylon pry tools.Another upgrade that's a little more difficult is upgrading the hard drive to either a larger drive like the Western Digital 1 TB Scorpio Blue SATA II 5400 RPM 8 MB Cache 2.5-Inch Bulk/OEM Notebook Hard Drive - WD10JPVT or an SSD flash drive like the Crucial 256 GB m4 2.5-Inch Solid State Drive SATA 6Gb/s CT256M4SSD2.Both of those upgrades shouldn't void the warranty according to the FTC's Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act of 1975, though the upgraded components would be covered by its manufacturer's warranty and not Apple.I use a lot of virtual machines and photo and video editing software, so I went all-out, though, and used the OWC Data Doubler Optical drive to SATA Hard Drive/SSD Converter to replace the SuperDrive with the stock hard drive, installed 16 GB RAM, and a 256 GB SSD. NOTE: These modifications are NOT covered by AppleCare, and I wouldn't recommend going that far unless you're comfortable with more advanced computer issues.That said, this laptop is screaming and wicked-fast.

I could not believe they did not consider the battery as defective so I went to the Apple store myself and asked for a manager.  He explained to me the battery expansion is \"normal\".  Apple doesn't cover battery expansion under any circumstances not even under their Apple Care.  The battery is simply considered \"consumable\" and NOT covered.I asked the manager if he feels comfortable with me posting the picture of the MacBook Air on the internet with the description that Apple doesn't consider the product defective.  His reply astonished me, looking down at me behind his thick glasses he said: \"Make sure you have your facts straight before you smear! They will contact you.\"  He didn't specify who are \"they\" but from the tone of his voice and his 6'5\" posture it indicated something between the SWAT team and a bunch of LAWYERS.Here is my take on all of this, the business model Apple pushes right now is to get some cheap junk from China, hire a bunch of cheerleaders straight out of high school, call them geniuses, and bully everybody who complains about their product.

It does everything I need, its fast, and its user friendly. If I ever run into a problem, I generally find my answer in the Apple support forums. They're extremely helpful. As far as insurance its costly, I wouldn't go with anyone besides Applecare or Best Buy's geek squad. Other cheaper options available on other sites are not trustworthy to me, plus they make you ship your computer out of the country and you are usually left without for weeks. No thank you. Bottom line, if you can afford it, get a Mac! If not, HPs are an awesome option as well, but consider lifespan and what type of user you are. Do your research!UPDATE:Still enjoying my Macbook Pro...considered trading for a newer model Macbook Air or Macbook pro w/retina. But after spending hours in the stores testing them out and reading reviews, I realized that although this model is older, it performs just as well as the newer models. The newer models are faster with downloading, but not a huge difference. I realized I would have to sacrifice features available on this model for thinness and faster downloading. Not worth the extra money I would have to spend and I'm comfortable knowing I could upgrade my 4GB ram to 8GB and my i5 to i7 whenever I want, if need be.

I want to like you. I really do. And you're making it so hard.The 13-inch MacBook Pro, back when it was simply called the MacBook, was a truly envy-inducing laptop. Debuting in the fall of 2008, it turned heads at coffee shops. It was the 15-inch Retina Display MacBook Pro of its time. No, it was better: it was the return, in a way, of the MacBook family to the more portable space once occupied by the 12-inch PowerBook G4.I digress because the looks of the 13-inch MacBook Pro haven't changed at all, really, since that fall. They haven't changed since last year, either. The 2012 MacBook Pro has newer third-gen Intel Core i5 and i7 processors, USB 3.0 ports, and better integrated graphics. That's it. The weight, the size, the battery life, and even the price remain the same. This is more of a spec bump than a new product. While the new 13-inch MacBook Pro is a little bit better than last year's 2011 model, the landscape for laptops is changing faster than ever.Windows laptops with similar components to the $1,199 13-inch Pro cost around $700. While the 13-inch Air has seen a price reduction, the Pro's continued status quo is all the more frustrating. Yes, the 13-inch Pro can be easily upgraded with more RAM or a larger hard drive or solid-state drive (SSD), and it has an optical drive and more ports, but it lacks the type of upgrades you'd expect on the higher, \"Pro\" end: no discrete graphics, no quad-core processor options, and no screen higher-res than 1,280x800 pixels.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Priced high and overheats A LOT", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1Q7S9U943Q6E", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Sleek and nice looking computer, however for the same price you could get a even more powerful computer.

Yes it is bigger, requires a little more time to startup but I believe that the keyboard and actually having a real working computer make up for those two things.  You use the pad on the computer instead of on the screen on the iPad but they seem to work exactly the same.  Try typing on an iPad and then on one of these computers.  No comparison.  Until screens are developed enough on iPads to allow for quick data entry they will never be more than a viewing machine.

I started getting the Graphic card problem when Opening and Operating iPhoto and graphic intensive programs (Final Cut Pro, Final Cut x etc)...first it was a glitch, like a tv going bad which turned to a blue screen, now it just goes straight grey, and won't restart or run a Disk Utility.I am saddened by the fact this is the disgusting results I am getting after years of buying APPLE Mac Book Pros.In total this is my 3rd, having bought my first MBP, back in 2003 (whatever they called it then anyway) and that suffered the same problem too.As I only took the regular 1 year Warranty on this model, and not the extended Apple care, I am asking AMAZON to intervene here, or for APPLE themselves to intervene here. It's plain disgusting to be having repeat problems after continuing to support this brand for almost a decade.", "Date": "August 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "MacBook pro was a waste of time and money", "Author": "Cedric", "ReviewID": "RGAIHUTL5GJZH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought my MacBook pro on february 25 2013 and I thought it was the greatest. It was fast, and it was \"different\". I fell in love with my machine, and it was pampered. Then only FOUR months later, my great MacBook pro FAILED. My 500 GB hard drive went \"bad\" according to APPLE. I'm so disgusted that I wasted my money on this product. I guess other users may have a different experience, but I'm livid that i had this experience!.I've used PC's all my life, and I have never had a single PC go on me this quickly - FOUR MONTHS!!!. My PC's have lasted for at least 3 years of heavy use before I encountered any problems with them.I never liked APPLE, and this incident  reaffirms my thoughts of the company. They are nothing more than a consumer hype company. Don't waste your money purchasing a Mac. Don't buy into the hype. Just get an ordinary PC that can do the dam job for a lot less money.Sadly, I'm still paying my credit card on this paper weight of a Mac.", "Date": "March 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "My Apple is now a Lemon", "Author": "Califrisco", "ReviewID": "RT5TOAAK7JTIQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This system had problems that started small: high pitched whine of the fans signaled a high CPU. Then the system would many times not power down without a forced power-off. The problems only got worse: reformatted the system hard drive to try and fix the system and then it lost total ability to connect to the Internet.Thank goodness that I bought Applecare before the included warranty expired. So I brought it into the local Apple Store for repair. This was a mistake.After 14 days, and two separate trips, and even a phone call to support in between the first and second repair, I'm still not sure that they got it right. First they replaced the logic board and the second time the memory. In the last 4 days after the second repair the system froze with a tick-tick-tick sound until forced powered off.There was a large 4-day gap in the second repair when, after two unanswered calls to the store, the Store employee who finally answered my return call to them (which stated that they needed a call with my go-ahead) did not inform the original Apple store employee that I had authorized the go ahead, so the system sat not being repaired for 4 days until they called me again asking for the same authorization.Now I am wondering if the hard drive is bad and caused the OS corruption and not the RAM. I bet they didn't check this.I now believe that I cannot trust this system, nor the repair techs at the Apple Store that I took it into.I now want a replacement system, refurbished or new, since I've lost trust in this system now and have spent countless hours restoring from my backups. If this had been a work system, I would have been down for 14+ days.I loved my older MacBook Book Pro 15\" and it only needed a new logic board after 3+ years. This one was to be my dream replacement system and I am in no way confident that this will last 1/2 as long.Needless to day, I am really very disappointed in Apple. Poor customer service has really wrecked this experience for me. The only reason I am giving it above a 1 star is that when it works, the system is pretty awesome: fast, beautiful screen and physically perfectly sized.UPDATE 2/4/13: More problems surfaced since my last review. Video is now officially glitchy (white/random rectangles dancing across the screen before the screen goes black) and has joined a new problem: a 3-Beep (pause) 3-Beep (pause) repetition that occurs when coming out of sleep mode. This beep will not stop until the system is hard-powered down. Apparently, this has to do with a memory issue--like the RAM that they replaced at the Apple Store.I now have an escalation going with an Apple Care Senior Adviser, apparently higher than your standard Apple Care tech, who promised to fix this given the myriad of problems. At this rate, they will probably replace everything within the unibody shell before they simply give me even a refurbished replacement system.Update 2/28/13: after now weeks of remote analysis and reporting, and essentially nothing being fixed, I've now been authorized to mail in the system for repair (with promises that Apple will not let me be stuck with a non-working system). At this point, it is so unstable that I cannot even do a backup without the screen shuddering and then the system locking up completely. I'm resigned that the hard drive will need full replacement as well as the RAM, and that I will essentially need to rebuild the system (again) from the backups. I'm hearing 4-5 business days and NO promises of a new/rebuilt system at all.

I tried for couple of days but nothing improved. So i took it to an Apple store & the Technician said that the Graphic card is defective. He quoted that \"The Fonts look horrible\". He recommended me to return, since it was less than 30 days. So i returned it & got another one, to my  dismay the other one was even worst than the earlier one. I needed to go to the Apple store again, but the problem is not solved. I think Apple has some serious problems in the Mac Book Pro. I am using computers more than 20 years.

I have been wanting to switch from PCs to Mac/Apple for a LONG, LONG time because I HATE Bill Gates (but that's a separate issue!) with a PASSION and I absolutely despise Microsoft and Windows-based computers. Until I got this MacBook Pro, ALL the computers I've had were PCs going all the way back to Windows 3.1 in the early 90's. But, no matter what kind of computer I've had (whether laptops, desktops or netbooks) and regardless of the brand (whether HP, Acer, Toshiba, Dell, Gateway, or some generic brand), and no matter what Windows operating system it used (whether Windows 3.1, Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 2000, Windows NT, Windows XP or Windows Vista), I had nothing but problems with the PCs from day one, with constant screen freezing, computer crashes, incredible slowness, viruses, spyware/malware/adware (despite anti-virus protection and anti-spyware/malware/adware software) and other hassles, while, most, if not every Apple user I spoke to said how much easier and user-friendly that Mac was -- and my own experiences using Apple/Macintosh computers all through school from elementary school through high school, was further confirmation. However, although I'd been wanting to switch to Mac for the past several years, I hesitated because of the price. I couldn't really afford it, and although I mentioned to my family how much I wanted to switch from PC to Mac, I didn't want to ask them (since they usually give major electronic items like computers as their main Christmas gift) to spend $1,200+ for a MacBook instead of the $500 -$600 max that they'd otherwise spend on a PC computer bought at Black Friday \"door-buster\" sales. So for at least 3-4 years I kept using the same crappy Windows laptop, while looking long and hard and comparing different Macintosh models and dreaming of someday being able to switch -- which finally happened this past Black Friday, when Best Buy had a sale for the 13 inch MacBook Pro for under $1,000 (okay it was $999, but still under $1,000!) which my family got me for Christmas. I am so glad they did, because I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my MacBook Pro!I am also VERY glad that my family got me THIS model, and NOT the Retina version, because the non-Retina MacBook Pro is the ONLY Apple/Mac product available now that still comes with an internal optical drive (although internal disc drives are not really a necessity with desktop models [like the Mac Mini or the iMac computers] that remain stationary and do not need to be carried around everywhere). Personally, I would MUCH rather have THIS MacBook Pro, and  I think its RIDICULOUS that the Retina version does not include an internal optical drive! Having no internal Blu-Ray in ANY of its products is bad enough but, especially, given the price-tag for MacBooks, lacking even a basic CD/DVD drive is ridiculous. Just because the greedy concept of \"planned obsolecence\" deems it necessary, does NOT mean that some of us are going to suddenly stop using and abandon/dispose of our dozens (if not hundreds!) of DVDs, CDs, cassette tapes and vinyl records, and just jump up to blindly embrace a disc-less and virtual future!I mean, although I only have probably about a half dozen or so Blu-Rays, I have HUNDREDS of CDs & DVDs (I lost count somewhere around 100, and wasn't 1/4 or even 1/8 of the way through the collection!) including both commercially-produced CDs & DVDs of music, movies & TV shows, as well as home-burned CDs and DVDs. I also have a few dozen vinyl records, and what seems like several hundred VHS videotapes, and audio-cassettes (either commercially-produced or purchased as blanks & painstakingly recorded personally) bought & collected, nearly all of which I still watch or listen to at one time or another. Many of us are not able to just jump like a jackrabbit from one latest technological craze to the next, from vinyl records and 8-tracks, to cassette tapes, to CDs and now to mp3s & iTunes, and from Betamax to VHS, to laser-discs to DVDs, to HD-DVDs, to Blu-Rays, and now to online video streaming. More importantly, not all of us are willing (or able to afford!) to suddenly replace our collections of music, movies and TV shows, recorded in a certain format, just because the technology has arbitrarily changed, often necessitating the re-purchase of that media in the new format. Which is why, even though I now DO have an mp3 player (which just got recently in the past year or two), an Apple TV (which I got from my brother this past Christmas) and a Sony television set with online streaming, I also still have & use not only a DVD player/recorder, but also a VCR, a 200 disc CD changer, a stereo with AM/FM radio & dual-cassette tape deck, and even a record player (a NEW Sony PS-LX250H Automatic Belt-Drive Turntable that I got a year or so ago) for vinyl LPs. Because its all videos or music which I enjoy watching or listening to, but yet, for the most part, I still don't like enough to waste money paying yet again to download it from iTunes (or other online streaming). Although it would probably be cheaper overall to just convert the music and videos to digital format on my own, it would probably take a lifetime to transfer everything -- and I'm not going to spend money to buy equipment to convert them to a format (like mp3) especially when, in a few years, it will likely just be deemed obsolete anyway!Which is another reason why I \u2661 my MacBook Pro! I LOVE that it includes an internal CD/DVD drive (and best of all, UNLIKE all my previous PC laptops, its NOT a bulky CD/DVD drawer, but rather just a sleek thin slot on one edge of the laptop). I'm almost always using my computer's CD/DVD drive to see movie or TV show DVDs or listen to CDs, and in my opinion having to carry additional components, like an external DVD drive totally defeats the purpose of even having a laptop (being a virtual replacement/equivalent to a desktop computer and yet also being portable enough to use it just holding it in one's hands while mobile!). Furthermore, its not like there's nothing available for those who want portable computing devices without optical drives. There ARE already more than enough options for them. They're called netbooks, iPads, iPad Minis, tablets, some kinds of Kindles, MacBook Airs, and even to a lesser degree, iPhones, smartphones and iPods -- and its one thing to make those without any disc drives because they are SUPPOSED to be ultra-portable, and CD/DVD drives would take up too much space & weight to keep them small and lightweight. But regular laptops are different, and what's the point of even having a laptop if a user is going to be bogged down having to lug around a bunch of other external peripherals like CD/DVD or Blu-Ray drives (as well as discs they want to play)  external hard drives & USB \"thumb\" jump storage drives, along with the requisite power cords/battery chargers................they may as well get a stationary desktop computer! UGH!!!! :\\In any case, the now-rare (since Apple have discontinued the internal optical drives in the 15 inch & 17 inch MacBooks and are planning to phase them out in the 13 inch ones) internal CD/DVD drive, is just one of the MANY things that I LOVE about my  Apple 13.3-Inch MacBook Pro. Even with only 4GB of RAM memory (though I'm considering buying a 16 GB of RAM memory \"upgrade\" from Crucial.com in the near future) this MacBook is LIGHTNING-FAST compared to any of the Windows computers I've ever had. Not only is it much faster, but Mac is far easier to use. For example, with every single one of the crappy Windows computers I've ever had, the screen/system would be freezing AT LEAST once or twice a day, if not more -- whereas in just the 4 or so months since Christmas that I've had this MacBook, I've only had like 1 incident of minor (far easier to handle than when the Windows PCs would freeze!) screen freezing, and even that was only when I was installing/updating some software so, in my opinion, the freezing was understandable -- and when I called Tech Support, Apple handled it so efficiently, that as soon as I spoke to them and did what they suggested, the computer was immediately unfrozen and I've had NO more problems since (though I don't even consider that particular incident a \"problem\")I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my MacBook Pro! The differences between this laptop and ANY & ALL of the Windows-based PCs I've had for the past 20+ years, is literally like NIGHT & DAY!Not only are Apple products much sleeker, and elegant-looking, but after experiencing first-hand how much faster and easier Mac OS is compared to Windows, I will NEVER, EVER buy a Windows-based PC or device again if I can help it! If only Bill Gates would spend more time trying to fix his bug-ridden, virus-plagued crap Windows PCs, and less time getting in bed with Monsanto & Merck and trying to pollute the planet and destroy mankind..........maybe then he'd be able to manufacture a quality product that, like Apple, is not vulnerable to every single virus and bug! There's a saying I heard from Apple users who said, \"Once you go Mac, you never go back!\", and its so true!

I am a resident of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and a customer of amazon for some time now. I have never had any problems with anything from the company but on the 29th of August I ordered a Mac-book Pro 13 inch Computer, it was to be delivered on the 4th of September. According to the tracking number it was delivered to the address that I use in the US for this purpose. On the 26th of September, after trying a number of avenues, I contacted Amazon telling them of my problem, so as to get some advice on how to track it down.I was incredibly but pleasantly surprised when I was offered a refund or replacement, where I come from this would never happen for an Item of this value.I did take a replacement and was willing to pay for expedited shipping when I was told that the company would do this for me at no extra cost, I am happy to say I received my mac-Book on the 1st Of October. I  am forever grateful to this company since a mac-book of this type costs approximately $12000.00 Trinidad and Tobago dollars and I have been saving for this for some time now.  I would like to say that Amazon has a customer for life since in reality it was no fault of their own the item went missing. Thank you Amazon and your wonderful staff( I think they all deserve a pay raise ;).Now on to the Mac-Book, while I never had a laptop PC before, I have had the use of quite a few, I am a practical person but if form can match function I would be satisfied. The Mac-Book is an amazing piece of hardware engineering, its beautiful to look at and exudes class, the screen is amazingly clear and crisp and the trackpad is heavenly to use. While there can be more USB ports, I suppose as a laptop there wouldn't be too many accessories attached since it may as well be a desktop. Another problem is that with extended use it becomes hot not overly so but it is quite noticeable. I am yet to fully explore the operating system and the programs on the computer but from the use that I did have, it is quite user friendly and  has exceeded my expectations.The one problem I do have is that there are some windows programs that have been the mainstay of the tasks that I usually have to perform. On the other hand the windows OS can be installed on the machine thereby giving the best of both worlds.

The laptop been a great educational tool (better then the iPads) and I can recommend it over any other Windows laptop. I am splitting this review into two parts, the laptop and the operating system.Laptop:The laptop is expensive; but you should consider it because of the stability and dependancy. The laptop is extremely quiet; even while I am typing this review I can hardly hear the fans going. Someone I know recently got a Dell laptop and the fans were so loud that it practically vibrated off the counter. Also, it hardly ever crashes. I did encounter a glitch that caused it to shut down without notice when I first started using it, but a month has passed and I have not seen it happen again. Along with the amazing durability is incredible speed. My Toshiba laptop will take three minutes to fully boot up and another five minutes to launch Chrome or Word. It's not an old laptop either; I received it roughly two years ago to replace my broken netbook. In comparison, Macbook Pro takes at most 30 seconds to boot and most applications will open instantly or within 10 seconds (with the exception of the Adobe software). The battery life is average, it will last almost 7.5 hours on normal settings. The graphics card supports split-screen (something my Dell could never do) and is able to render models with high-polygon count. It's a high-priced but worthy laptop.The operating system:What really kills Windows is the Mountain Lion OS, which is on the Macbook Pro by default. The UI (user interface) can be customized in almost every way; from repositioning the dock to changing the color of the menus. The \"multiple desktop\" function allows you create more than one desktop, allowing you to spread programs out. A simple swipe across the trackpad and you can switch between desktops easily. Applications are easily found by activating Launchpad, an iPad style grid. The UI is simple enough for most people to learn and includes a lot of bells and whistles for those who want full potential. Keyboard shortcuts are another handy thing that Windows lacks a lot of, by entering a key combination you can access Spotlight (Mac's version of the Windows start button), empty the trash, create new folders, even hide applications! Mountain Lion also offers voice recognition, by entering a key combination (FN x2 by default) the Siri mic will appear and you can speak whatever you want to be typed. Windows 7 has something like this,but  all I remember it doing was asking \"What was that?\". Along with easily access to these features you get various functions that Windows does not have. Airdrop is a mode that allows you to send to anybody on the LAN (Local Area Network). It has came in handy multiple times when I am in class and need to send a file to somebody. Dashboard is a special screen that has things like a translator, calculator, and sticky notes on it for easy access.Overall, Macbook is something you must get. Macbook can dual-boot both Windows 7 and Mountain Lion, so you can have both on one laptop if you must. The durability of the laptop will make it worth the money.", "Date": "October 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE LOVE LOVE!", "Author": "rolltide714", "ReviewID": "RB65C60F84XA2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being a tech savvy, APPLE - product loving person, I'm glad I finally got the MacBook Pro!

Mainly bought a 15.4\" MacBook Pro as my older 13\" felt cramped for working with audio projects and using an external monitor often was getting tiring. With most storage products shifting to USB 3.0, I felt it was perfect timing to shop.Key highlight of owning a Mac is the iLife suite, iPhoto is still the leader of being a great photo album/management tool with some consumer friendly editing features, iMovie is the benchmark of easy to use video editing software and GarageBand went from being an audio recording platform for everyday users to adding more teaching lessons since '09. Out of the box you have a very nice ready to go creative machine.Hardware features:--15.4\" screen(non-high res) is still great, I prefer 16:10 displays over the squished 16:9 displays. While I'm not a fan of glossy screens the way Apple designed the glossy cover over the screen it keeps the backlight from bleeding vs makers who put a glossy coating onto the screen panel itself. Viewing angle on glossy vs non-glossy MacBook Pros is better than most notebooks on the market.--Processor, I know my review at this point is already \"old\" with Haswell(4th generation Core i) based computers reaching the market, Ivy Bridge(3rd Generation Core i) Quadcore easily crunches through encoding/decoding vs dual-core.--Graphics processor, this is the only reason you'll want a 15\" MacBook Pro/Retina MacBook Pro is the nVidia graphics as it can handle running software which are GPU dependent(animation, editing software and gaming). I can admit if you plan to do light gaming, consider using Boot Camp to run Windows 7 as you're able to use the newest/better nVidia graphics drivers--Apple only updates graphics drivers with software updates or new OS releases so performance can vary.--Bluetooth, in an era where most computers have this optional, Apple has always made this standard on their notebooks since 2004. Often I use this to sync my phone contacts/calendars/to do lists.--USB 3.0, this was my 2nd excuse to get a new Mac. Backups and transfering large projects via USB 3.0 is much faster than past Macs with USB 2.0.--Thunderbolt, at the moment you're either seeing PCIe expansion solutions for audio/video professionals or RAID storage products. With USB 3.0 being cheaper, I'm starting to worry this will fall into Firewire territory of only select groups of owners actually use it. Beyond highspeed, most users will use this for a 2nd monitor.--Firewire 800, looks like this could be the last Mac with it built-in based on the direction Apple is shifting towards. I use audio interfaces with Firewire so this is important. Older Mac owners may also still use FW400/800 external hard drives.--DVDRW Drive, some of us still use/need the drive and wasting bag space to carry one isn't ideal.Overall this is the only option for an aftermarket upgradable portable Mac. I didn't bother making notes on the memory/HDD as I cloned the HDD to a WD Black 750GB and installed 16GB of memory. Since everybody has different work/lifestyle requirements, sooner or later you'll feel the stock 4GB of memory isn't enough.", "Date": "August 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mac 13.3 is a good buy", "Author": "Joe", "ReviewID": "RK93ZCF8GY1T1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great laptop.

The exterior is absolutely gorgeous. The backlit keyboard is a great feature not to mention the key spacing makes typing so natural and easy. I also like how the rear apple logo stays lit while the laptop is on. When connected to Wi-Fi the Internet runs blazing fast and the screen quality is bright and crisp. Even after comparing this model with the MacBooks with retina display the little difference I saw didn't seem worth paying several hundred dollars more. 500GB is plenty of hard drive space for my needs and later on I might upgrade to 8GB of DDR3 memory but for now I'm very happy with its performance. I know some PC fans are hesitant to switch to a different operating system but honestly it's very easy to get used to especially if you've owned other Apple products in the past (i.e. iPhones, iPods etc...) The one and only thing I would change to match that of the PC laptops is on a MacBook tapping the touch pad does not serve as a \"click\" on a program. That's definitely a minor complaint so don't let my nit-pickyness discourage you. Sure MacBooks are a little pricey but take my word for it the investment is well worth it. These computers last on average 5-6 years which is way better than paying a little less and buying a PC laptop that is likely to break in a year.

I wanted the familiar Windows OS with the hardware the MBP had to offer, but initially ran into a few problems. I'll post the problems and their solutions that I discovered in case anyone else runs into similar problems.1. After installing the drivers for Windows, my webcam didn't work. It said that the drivers were not installed yet even after I downloaded the most recent driver package from Apple.Solution: it turned out to be pretty simple. My previous laptop had software preinstalled that controlled the webcam and added effects to it, and I erroneously thought that since my MBP didnt have this program that the webcam wasn't working. After installing the drivers my webcam actually worked fine with Facebook chat.2. The MBP got REALLY hot when running windows 7. This couldnt be good for the computer components, but also posed a fire risk.Solution: while on windows I installed a program called MacFan (just google it) that after typing in a few commands in the command prompt allowed me to turn up the fan speed indefinitely to significantly cool off the laptop. While in windows the fans aren't correctly utilized according to CPU usage so you'll have to do this process upon each startup. Just search on YouTube \"how to install macfan\" for thorough instructions.3. Videos on youtube while in windows do not expand fully to the screen, instead leaving black bars on the bottom and right sides.Still haven't solved this. I'd expect adjusting the screen resolution would have an effect but I haven't tried this yet.4. The battery life decreased from 7 hours to about 2.5 hours while on Windows.This couldn't be solved either. It's just how windows works on the Mac. The only solution is to turn the brightness down, etc.5. When I click an icon on the taskbar, its title flashes over it. (not the biggest deal but its annoying)Updated my Nvidia drivers from their website and it solved minor graphics problems.As for my actual review of the MacBook Pro, I am very satisfied. I run both windows 7 and mountain lion on it through bootcamp (helpful detailed instructions can be found on YouTube). That way I have the ability to run all my old games and programs on windows while having the Mac side to use for top notch picture and video editing, plus the App Store. I've always preferred the relative simplicity of Microsoft office 2007 for windows, so I use that.After adjusting trackpad and click settings on the windows side, navigation is easy and fluid. The separated keyboard buttons took some adjusting to but that's not any issue. The screen is bright, clear, and rich while the backlit keyboard helps for typing in dark environments.It's about 2 pounds lighter than my previous laptop and significantly thinner, and what I'd consider to be portable. Ill be using it at college next year and will report back on just how portable it is.Graphics, processing, and RAM are all lightning fast and should be useful in intensive software that ill be using. The only problem I've noticed is that after partitioning the hard drive, startup takes a little longer (around 22 seconds total).The power cord is portable and extendable, while its nice to still have the optical drive, Ethernet port, and card slot. Only having 2 USB ports so close in proximity is a minor issue with larger thumb drives, etc. but I may just purchase a separate hub.All in all, you won't regret buying this. The higher cost will pay off well in a long computer life.

I was surprised to discover that this machine can do gaming also, it runs League of Legends and Team Fortress 2 at 60 FPS on the native 1280x800 resolution. OS X is really great at letting you multi-task with ease. I would recommend increasing the ram in order to increase performance on your machine. I installed a 16GB ram kit from Crucial and I noticed an immediate increase in performance. The backlit keyboard is amazing to type on. I have typed for hours and have yet to feel fatigued. The MacBook Pro is a great product which can meet the needs of the average consumer. For those wondering whether to get the MacBook Air or the Pro I would recommend buying the Pro. The MacBook Pro (non-retina) is easily customizable, just buy a SSD and ram and you will have a blazing fast machine in your hands.

We had saved all of the packaging just in case there was an issue and we boxed everything up the way it was when we received it. UPS came , slapped on the label gave us a tracking slip and off it went. In the meantime, Amazon sent out the replacement which we received in a matter of a few days.

It's not upgradable either, but chances are if you're buying a Mac you won't be doing that anyway.The i7 processor on Apple's lightweight OS X is impressively fast for a laptop, and 8GB of RAM is more than enough for most uses. Mine had a 640GB hard drive and an optical drive that worked well enough.It's expensive, yes, but Macbooks are impressive systems even for this price. They're made from aluminum instead of plastic and are solidly built, and very compact. The i7 processor coupled with Nvidia's mobile graphics card is powerful enough to game on, BUT...the real deal-breaker for me with this Mac was its cooling. In favor of a sleek \"unibody\" design, Apple neglected to install proper cooling for the CPU or the graphics, with the only exhaust vent being behind the hinge of the laptop, and no intake vents anywhere. Fifteen minutes of Minecraft would easily get the CPU chip hot enough to boil water, and sometimes it would just crash. The lack of vents on the bottom makes chill mats/cooling pads a fruitless effort. The aluminum body absorbs some of the heat, but this is actually a bad thing, because it can easily get too hot to keep on your lap, and touching the bottom with bare skin could even cause minor burns.So I sold mine off.

Which is terrible if your moving 34Mb raw audio files. Once i figured out how everything works (about a week) i found that working on a Mac is just waaaaaaay faster and more productive than working on windows. From the DAW perspective, Mac doesn't support VST format...so thats kind of an issue. Your plugins have to be AU format and theres not many of them out there. Sucks. But...this computer comes with iLife or whatever its called. Basically Garageband, and some photo and video editing software (dont care). Garagebands not bad. Its like a super dumbed down version of Logic, which is Mac only anyway, so probably a good place to start. It comes with pretty much everything you'll need to start recording. Got a guitar, and that rocksmith game? well, macbook pro recognizes that cable and you can record directly into your usb port into garageband. pretty cool. No driver install necessary...like on a windows computer, where you would need ASIO4ALL or something.

The iMac is still functioning for the kids and still works great after 8 years. The issue is we can no longer upgrade to the newest version of OSX thus we don't get the benefits of the new features. The new MBP offers great portability and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to purchase a new laptop in 18 months. Something we did often when we purchased Windows based laptops.Apple OSX is simple to use and has a more enjoyable and intuitive interface than the new Windows 8. I'm not saying it's for everyone but it's a great solution if you want a simple to use device that you know won't be at the end of it's life cycle in a couple of years.Pros-Great functionality-Integration with iCloud and many of the apps you use on an iPad and iPhone.-Log battery life even with wifi on and streaming movies via netflix-Very durable unibody case-Still has an optic drive-Mag Safe power cord is a nice touch-Intel i5 processor works very well-The chicklet keyboard is AWESOME!-The single best function is the backlit keyboard. There is nothing worse than trying to work on a plane and not being able to see the keys without an overhead light that blinds you.-The track pad is incredible. I'm a person that will not use a laptop without a mouse. I just don't like trackpad's because they never work right. That is until now. I can easily use the Apple Track Pad without any issues and now I don't even travel with a mouse. My bag just got a little lighter.

Just because the processor is a 64bit architecture and can efficiently utilize the RAM. I wouldn't by the factory RAM just because it's expensive. Amazon has a nice selection of RAM from various suppliers that will work.

Now my daughter discovers that none of her peers are using FCP X because it is too costly, too restrictive, too difficult to learn, and they are going back to PCs and using  Avid and Adobe!In a few months my daughter has an assignment to North Africa. She is taking the old Samsung netbook with her, and leaving the Macbook Pro (as she says, selling for parts) behind in Istanbul.If you are the type of urbanite who has access to an Apple store and/or can call Apple care toll free, maybe a MBP is for you.

The ones that overheated and died an early death. Also based on my past excellent experience with mac computers I did not purchase an extended warranty. My MacBook Pro died about a month ago and I almost did not get another one. Unfortunately I had become a mac addict because when a Mac works it works very well. My Windows based computers were always crashing, usually about every three months. The worst a Mac ever did to me was freeze up.My new Macbook Pro arrived yesterday. I normally DO NOT write a review until after I have used an item and on a computer I wait 3 months. I am breaking that rule today because there has been some IMPORTANT CHANGES that I feel people need to know about especially those folks like me who have had a bad experience with this line of macs.This Macbook Pro RUNS FAR COOLER than any mac I have ever owned EVEN WHEN THEY WERE NEW. This might be because of the new i5 processor. It might be because Apple re-engineered them and cured whatever it was that caused the problem. I don't know. All I know is that even my longest lasting macs always ran fairly warm and that 2010 model ran hot all the time. In my opinion this should make these new macs run far longer than the old ones especially if you get the solid state drive( I did not).This Macbook Pro has my other Macs beat on speed even when they were new.I will update this review and report any problems I come across. If you see no updates it's good news. One thing is for sure. With this Mac I am purchasing the extended warranty through Squaretrade. Apples warranty is too expensive and only runs 3 years. At one time they offered 5 years. The Squaretrade warranty goes up to 4 years and is about $50 cheaper.", "Date": "October 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Apple Machine For Great Price", "Author": "EJ", "ReviewID": "RVRIMFIO84A3B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I searched many websites and only Amazon had low price for this Apple Machine.

I still have to use my two other windows machines to get most of my work done because, as much of a pleasure as the Mac is to use, it's not worth re-purchasing of a ton of software. One thing I am still happy about is the price I paid at Amazon. I had been watching the prices for six months and a brick and mortar store (rhymes with Test Fry) put it on sale the week of Thanksgiving. Amazon's prices can change by the minute and for about two hours, the price dropped as low as it had ever been and matched the Test Fry price. Even though I can't use it for work much, I am still glad I made the purchase. The best features to me are the multiple desktops, the swipe gestures, and the seamless way they work together. Also, the way it works with Apple TV is nothing short of amazing. The more Apple products you have, the more it sense it makes to acquire more. And lets face it, reading these reviews isn't really going to sway you on the product, only on where you purchase it. And with my Amazon Prime membership (the best $79 I've spent in years) buying it here was a no-brainer. $3.99 got it here overnight. Any repairs are going to have to be made by Apple anyway and who wants to deal with a pretentious \"Apple Genius\". I prefer \"Google Genius\". Oh, and a Book Book is worth the price.

However, after having several other Apple devices over the years and enjoying the lack of errors and problems with the devices and the OS's, I gave it more consideration as I approached buying my very first laptop (after having over 20 years experience on desktop PC's).  I saved about $300 buying it on Amazon rather than elsewhere (no sales tax, big discount and $3.99 overnight shipping with Prime). The machine is brand new and it came installed with the Mountain Lion OS.The screen is excellent, it boots up fast. USB 3.0 is very fast. The trackpad works far better than I had anticipated. The gestures are amazing. The OS is very different than Windows, but is not hard to navigate. I store my regular 'Work in Process' documents on Dropbox, so those were a cinch to pull over. I still have to migrate my pictures and music to the machine. All of my bookmarks in Safari that I created over the years on the iPad pulled over seamlessly. The integration with my other Apple products via iCloud is outstanding.Everything from the box, the instructions, initial setup, downloading and installing software, the navigation of the OS....it all has a consistent and polished look.  Before i bought this I felt like I was getting the 'low end' laptop from Apple. After using it for a few days I am in awe of the performance and design. The screen is the perfect size and everything pops on it. It is very thin and quiet! I haven't heard a fan yet. This is money well spent. Thanks!Update 1: I upgraded my RAM to 8 gigs and this laptop is blazing fast!!! I can't believe it had the impact that it does. If this machine continued to run just like it does now, I won't need to upgrade for years to come.

First of all, the trackpad on the Macbook Pro is easy to use and after you learn all the gestures to use the trackpad you will see that this is a great way to use you computer.

My aging PC was misbehaving all the time -- cursor jumping, skipping to a new page without my initiating it, losing my work... so many times I would whisper to it, Mac...Mac...Mac...and finally I decided to do it.I love my iPhone, and because I was used to that, learning the Mac was very easy. The icons are the same and the way it operates is very similar. It is designed to be user-friendly. I was fully able to use it comfortably within an hour.I chose the 13.3 inch laptop because I thought that was a good size for me, and I chose the 8 gigabyte memory and more powerful processor because I think as programs and operating systems that need more power and memory come along, it will be adaptable and consequently will last longer. Another deciding factor in which version to buy was going to the Apple website and seeing what the 4 gig model with the less powerful processor would cost with double the memory. Their price turned for that out to be the same as the Amazon price for the one with the more powerful processor and the 8 gig memory.  I chose the one without retina display, and having seen both side by side at the local Mac store, I am really happier with the non-retina display model. I think the picture is actually sharper, in spite of what they say about the retina display.I am a writer and take some online classes, and it works beautifully for both. I can do my work and store it on the iCloud. It has an excellent sound system and will play CDs. That's another reason I chose this model rather than the Mac Air, which has no slot for CDs.Some things I don't like about it are lack of a way to delete the words or letters in front of the cursor instead of just the words or letters behind it, and not being able to play Cubis on it. (Cubis has never made a Mac version.) The things I love about it far outweigh this.The battery lasts for about 7 or 8 hours of continuous work and recharges quickly.

Soft touch, anodized aluminum with laser cut precision and no flaws. I love the little rubber seam that runs all the way around the edge of the screen that protects the screen from being scratched by the palm pads of the inner side. The keys are durable, and only start to wear out (become shiny) after about 1,000,000 hours of continuous use. I have another 2008 Black MacBook That has seen the most lengthy writing sessions with much sweating upon, and the keys still feel as good as new. I don't like the fact that the Screen is a fingerprint and dust magnet, but I fix that by wiping the screen down as a thing I do every Saturday Morning. The paint indicators on the side of the MacBook indicating which port is which has slowly become rubbed out from abrasion, but I know what port is now, so its ok. I wish I still had the paint in case I needed to sell it. The fan exhaust is located right under the screen hinge, and since it is easily covered, the laptop easily heats up. The trackpad is as smooth as velvet. I wish it was a entire button, so the trackpad wouldnt have to bend down when you press it at the top, but I've gotten used to the old way of thinking and using my thumb as a button-presser.Software:I can't say muchI love Macintosh. Grew up with it from OS 8I love how seamless and flawless it is. I can't wait for Mavericks, and I know it'll be a bestseller.I really love the fact that Mac has an app store with its constantly growing database, and great games.I wish iLife came hooked up to your account as soon as you enter your apple id with icloud so you can update it as part of your app collection, but since it doesnt cost that much, its coolHardware:Apple always has bleeding edge performance and I love their support of everything out thereMy Mac rarely ever lags, and even when it does, (unless the fan is blocked), the fan is almost unnoticeable. I've heard that they fixed the problem with the new Retina Display MacBook Pro though with the adjusted frequency fans. I really want to try that out for my self.I also love the super fast Ivy Bridge 2.6 Ghz processor with Great battery life.They only fact that I wish they had done was refresh the ENTIRE Mac lineup along with the MacBook Air's when they changed the processors to Haswell.Overall:I love this product.I love appleJust wish they continued the color variety.I dont know how much effort it would take to make an anodized black macbook pro, macbook air, and a iMac, but if they did, I know that if they did, people would trip over each other just to get their hands on one of themI know I would.So until that happens, I'm sticking with this.", "Date": "August 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "So Far, So Good", "Author": "Judy T", "ReviewID": "R2TXT4IAQ22JO3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the MacBook Pro MD103LL/A on 7-30-13 and received it from Amazon (through DataVision) on 8-2-13.I've had this computer now for one week and love it.I also bought the AppleCare Protection Plan for this computer from Amazon on 7-30-13.I received that on 8-8-13, registered for this plan, and look forward to using it if the need should arise.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great and fast", "Author": "Nicky Rus", "ReviewID": "R37630LCJ92KIE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Highly recommended, insanely fast and great computer, doing heavy multi-taking and office work etc all at once and it just runs and processes flawlessly, the battery life is extremely great as well.", "Date": "August 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Apple MacBook Pro MD101LL/A", "Author": "worldunix", "ReviewID": "R1IZ48TWWDJ5R8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this for my Kid for CollegeShe love itreplaced her older one that i now use :-)Get one you wont go wrong", "Date": "August 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great computer", "Author": "Hannan", "ReviewID": "RQSWJJI0K7GFU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great computer, very happy with this purchase.Mac runs just the way you'd expect it to.No problems at all.Highly recommended!", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mac Book Pro 13\" Great Brand and Great price!", "Author": "SuperClear", "ReviewID": "R75V6THAM2CG9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Mac Book Pro 13\" is a perfect Laptop if you want use it for your home.

The problem for me has been all with memory (ram) even with the ram maxed out on both computers I every once in a while have it lock up while editing photos (professional photographer) at first I thought aperture 3 was the problem, I switched over to Lightroom and there was a noticeable improvement but the problem remains. I have brought both in for service a number of times.- there was an issue with the seal on the monitor which caused dust to get under the screen- there was a problem with the screen refusing to wake from sleep modeEvery time apple handles the problem & fixes it for free. Apple products generally work out the small issues on their own, you only get problems when it's something big. Fortunately apples customer service is great.While I had my MacBook in for service I used my husbands HP laptop (similar specs) and there were many more quirks so overall I'm still happy with my purchase - apple still beats out windows/bios systems hands down but I would be lying if I said I wasn't concerned about the seemingly obvious decrease in quality over the years. I buy a new Mac every 2-3 years for work. With the needs of a professional photographer I generally need to keep up with the best specs. I've never had a pc live longer than that.

From 1988 to 2010 I was a graphic arts professional, electronically based on Macintosh computers, and a consultant to other such professionals in helping them deal with computers in their business. But when Apple walked away from supporting older software, some of which CANNOT be updated, by discontinuing Rosetta when they introduced their Lion operating system, I decided I would no longer purchase, support or recommend a Mac.Unfortunately my wife's 2009 MacBook Air developed a hardware problem that didn't seem worth repairing. I couldn't talk her out of another Mac, and very I'm sorry for that. This mac has been a problem since we got it. Even though it uses an I7 Intel processor, it is no faster and may be slower than the system it replaced. Startup times are incredibly long: over two minutes. This has to be because of software bloat from what I would argue is the worst MacOS since the original 128k mac introduced in 1984 (which I owned).Perhaps if you've never owned a computer, none of this would bother you, but if you come from an older mac or from the Windows side, the clunkiness and sloth will drive you nuts. In addition, of course, since pre-intel software is no longer supported, about 1/3 of my wife's programs were trashed. Some we could replace (the Office suite for $150 we didn't need because the version we had served her needs, but won't run on the new mac), while others have never and will never be updated. Fortunately we do have other older macs (Snow Leopard or earlier capable) so we can kludge.Recently however, this Macbook loses the ability to print to our network laser printer, a HP Color Laser Jet. The computer says it can't find the printer, even though it printed to it 10 minutes before, and other computers on the ethernet, both mac and windows, can also print to it. Given the way print spooling works the only reliable way to reestablish printing capability has been to trash the print que and create a new one. Sometimes this is possible through Bonjour (the Apple print protocol) or more likely it must be done via direct ip addressing, which in our local LAN with an address of 192.168.x.x, the computer thinks our printer is in Boise, Idaho! How stupid is that?By the way, when the print que is deleted to fix the printer, everything in that que is lost. Not a problem unless we were printing many pages from different web addresses which were sent to printer while we went on without keeping track. Rebuilding such a que is a pain.If you already have a Lion-based Mac, then getting this computer will not surprise you and you will probably find it very nice because you don't know any better. If you have an older mac, or a windows system, I strongly suggest you go to windows or stay there.

And mine had broke but I sent it in under warranty-no problems. So My sister and I again got new matching laptops-Toshiba Satellite. Under a year, The Corner where I open the laptop broke and Costumer service sucked. I called, emailed, and searched way to long just find where to send it. And I sent it in and got it back. Within like 4 months mine had broke again (out of warranty now) And I was done. My sisters same laptop broke about the month later for the same reason. I couldn't even open or close it. That defeated the whole point of a laptop. So I was done. I have wanted a Macbook for a while. And after me and my sisters multiple laptop problems I was willing to pay a lot to try Mac. I also thought it would be good now that I started College. I heard nothing but good things about Macs. I have been to the Apple Store for problems with my iPhone charging cord and it gets fixed, no problems, great service. And the warranty starts over when you get a new cord. I love that! And since I have a iPhone I get emails from Apple. I got a email for the Back to School Sale. I got educational pricing and Got this Macbook Pro 13.3 inch For $999. And Plus this promotion I got a $100 gift Card to the App Store. I thought that was the best offer I could get. So Me and My twin ordered it from the store. The gift card and the laptop came separately. And One thing I like was that when the gift card came, it did have a return address but it didn't say Apple so when people saw it they wouldn't steal the gift card. But You can tell that it was from Apple. When I opened the box for the Macbook, besides it having the charger for it, it had a extension to add to it. I didn't read anywhere that that was included but it is! I have been using the Macbook Pro for about 3 weeks now and I absolutely love it! I was new to the Mac system and It was pretty easy to use. The touchpad I was lost but I looked at videos on Youtube to figure out how to use the shortcuts and things. The software is fast. Laptop is comfortable, portable, and somewhat lightweight. Before I got the Back to School Promotion, I was thinking of getting the new macbook Air. But I wanted the Pro for the CD/DVD player. And since the educational pricing was $999 for the Pro, the original price of the Air, I decided on the Pro. I am using my Pro typing this. You can get the educational pricing all year long I saw. I did not know this when I bought it but that didn't change my mind that I wanted to get it anyway. I love how easy it is to use. Also I LOVE the feature of the light up keyboard. I use my computer for typing things and when I don't want to get up to turn on the light because I am focused or because I am to lazy, I can just turn the brightness up. I can close my laptop and when I open it, I type in my password and I am in within 1 second. My other laptops took like 2 minutes just to wake up. The battery Life on this laptop is AMAZING. Use like for 7 hours compared to the 2-3 hours of my other ones. I recommend this laptop for anyone! I will update later if any problems arise. ( I don't think any problems will arise)I do want to recommend that to save the battery, let the battery charge to 100% then unplugg it and let it totally die. Then Plug it back in.

With such a machine, any audiophile or media person is practically assured of having a self-contained portable audio workstation, one that will record LPs, cassette tapes, FM broadcasts with a simple line (in my case, from an Onkyo receiver) to the \"Audio In\" of the machine, nothing else required.  Moreover, the presence of the two ports permits near-flawless capturing of any of the sounds emitted from a website or from the computer by attaching a simple patch cord between the two ports (I use an inexpensive splitter at the \"Audio Out\" port for monitoring purposes.  Finally, the built-in optical drive obviates the need to drag along an external drive, which can prove clumsy at best (taking up extra space on the desk) and mal-functioning at worst (I've never had a problem with an internal SuperDrive, but the external Apple Drives have failed with astonishing regularity, requiring all sorts of ingenious tricks to remove a stuck CD and often suffering damage in the process of removal).By contrast with this machine, the new iMac (and most of the other Macbooks) offers neither an optical drive nor an \"audio in\" port. Moreover, with the lack of an internal optical drive, I've forfeited two of the machine's USB ports--one to an interface; the other, to a burner--while attempting, with sporadic success, to import decent audio into the computer.  (At least, I've learned to purchase only external optical drives that have an eject button and a slide-out tray.  None of the non-Apple optical drives has presented so much as a single problem--and each has cost me under $50).I was among the first to purchase the unloved, scorned-upon Macbook Air back in 2008.  The first model had some costly problems (that problematic hinge!), but Apple withstood the flak (especially about the absence of an optical drive) and by 2010 came to market with not one but two Macbook Airs--an 11\" and  13\".  The criticism has waned, and now I'd be the first to recommend an Air for truly portable computing.  Unfortunately, what was once regarded as an aberration, then a curiosity, and finally a respected member of the Apple family, has now, it would appear, become the \"prototype\" for all Apple models.  I would expect the machine you're looking at to be the last Apple machine to come with the 3 features mentioned above.This may be a transitional time in Apple's history, one leading, moreover, to another consumer computing revolution and to a roaring comeback in Apple's stock price.  If people increasingly find CDs useless--even in their music collections--and if makers of ancillary products begin to show more products that might benefit from the added speed of US 3.0 and Thunderbolt (which is close to being all that remains of Apple connectivity apart from \"the Cloud\"), Apple could win big--really big.  But in the meantime, consumers who purchase, for example, a new iMac can only be left scratching their heads about how to make use of all those super-fast ports (USB 3 and Thunderbolt) on the back of their new machines, however ahead of the curve they may be.  At this point, the iMac has become less about practicality than bragging rights (\"look guys, mine has a Fusion Drive--just take my word for it\").", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Rating product", "Author": "Monica Ardon", "ReviewID": "RJFRJI8AZFI8S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i consider rating the product because it's not a simple thing to buy online and in different conditions fromother stores....i took an aim and it was great. the computer is in excellent shape and its new!!!! good review from me!!!!", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Apple MacBook Pro", "Author": "Daniel Ramirez \"danramirez\"", "ReviewID": "R3BOX3XEQEXKEY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Es mi 3ra laptop y defininitavemente son las mejores a nivel mundial.

Boot time is super fast, around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute. Apps launch super fast, and the 500GB HDD is more than sufficient. I usually use my Mac for school work and internet browsing, so the entry-level 13\" MacBook Pro is already more than what I expected from a computer I would typically use it for. Macs hardly ever get viruses, and they are completely incompatible with existing Microsoft Windows Viruses. Furthermore, Mac OS X Mountain Lion's Gate keeper prevents the user from downloading malware and trojans, which keep your data safe and your computer running at optimum speed. The keys on the keyboard are evenly spaced and are back-lit, which make it easy to use at night and for speed writing (Typing?). Overall, the screen resolution, though non-retina, is sufficient for normal web browsing and work. I still don't get why retina displays are standard on most new iOS devices, but are only available on the MacBook Pro with Retina Display (Total cheapskate!). The thunderbolt port is awesome! It's 10gbps transfer speeds surpass even the super-fast USB 3.0 (Which also comes with the MBP). US 3.0 comes with the MBP and has transfer rates of up to 5gbps. Other ports include FireWire 800, Gigabit Ethernet, MagSafe port, Microphone jack. SDHC card reader and an optical drive for burning and reading discs.The glass track pad is large enough for Apple's highly acclaimed multi-touch gestures for scrolling through web pages with two fingers, zooming in on certain parts of certain apps by double tapping with two fingers, accessing launchpad by pinching with five fingers and using mission control by swiping up with four fingers.You can also buy one of Apple's magic mice, which connect to your Mac using Bluetooth, and also allows you to use certain multi-touch gestures such as zoom and scroll.For Windows users switching to a Mac, you can also enable right clicking (known to apple as secondary click) in the system preferences> Mouse and enabling right clicking.The unique to apple aluminium uni-body is a real beauty. It makes the MBP very durable and protects it from scratches, though you shouldn't go launching it against a wall for the sake of trying it.For Windows users who are used to using Microsoft Office, you can buy a license for the latest Microsoft Office software for Mac (Currently 2011) at any of apple's retail stores, Apple Authorised resellers, any store that sells Microsoft Office for Mac or downloading the software directly from Microsoft's website.*Users without an optical drive can skip the installation of Microsoft Office and head to the next section*To install the software, simply insert the disc provided in the package into the optical drive and open and install all the files.Enter your code printed on the back of your CD sleeve when prompted.Done! Enjoy using Microsoft Office!*For those without an optical drive (MBP with Retina Display and MB air), read this. Users with and optical drive can skip this section*To download Microsoft Office, go to Microsoft's website and download the trial version. When prompted, enter your code printed on the back of your CD sleeve to unlock the full potential of Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac.The Mac app store and iTunes store are phenomenal. The Mac app store is your one-stop shop for Mac software, though you can also download software online at your own risk. There are currently around 10,000 apps on the App store (and counting...), and billions of songs available for download fro the iTunes store. iTunes is also you default (And also your only) media player besides DVD player, or any other media players you may come across on the internet. iTunes is one of the better media players available on the market with it's simple to use User Interface. Users switching from a PC will definitely prefer iTunes to Microsoft's Windows media player.Overall, the high price of the MacBook Pro may convince users to buy a cheaper Windows PC instead. But remember, you are paying a high premium for a product with better build quality and high quality software, which is a joy to work with, considering that you can finally work in peace without having to worry about the millions of Windows viruses out in the wild attacking countless careless and oblivious PC users.

The macbook pro is really responsive. If you've used an iPhone (or any touch screen device) you can use a mac's track pad no problem. I used to hate using track pads on PC's because they were always so small, I don't mind using the mac's track pad but would consider buying the magic mouse just because I'd rather use a mouse and the glass touch pad makes me nervous, I'm halfway afraid I'll break it. At the apple store I had the guy change the track pad so you don't have to click it, I can just tap it to open an app.The graphics are pretty good for someone who doesn't game a lot, if you're used to a lower end PC's graphics you'll be impressed by these graphics, although before I bought the mac I had a netbook and I was impressed by it's graphics too. If you haven't played with a mac in person, be sure to check one out somewhere if graphics are your tipping point. The screen is really nice, very clear and bright. The mac installed Microsoft office for mac with no problems. The only thing I would say that I don't like about the mac is that you cannot download more than one app at a time and it takes forever to download apps. I had to install Mountain Lion and it took a good two hours. I've noticed that if you close your open windows the app download time is less. The mac does get hot when it's charging, and when it's not it's still pretty hot (and I mean hot not warm.) Be sure to have good air flow where ever you put it. I have a fan blowing toward mine and it's been cool all morning even with the charger in. If you're going to let a little one play with it make sure you set it on a desk so it doesn't heat up your baby's lap. I've read that the mac becomes cooler as it gets more broken in, but I have no proof of that yet. I would recommend to a friend if they can afford it, if not an iPad or an iPod touch really isn't too far off. Also if you're a netbook user like I was the macbook will seem kind of heavy, but I'm sure after carrying it to and from your destinations (school, work) it will seem lighter.  One more thing, this mac does NOT come with restore disks and I am not sure if you can make them direct from the mac like you can with newer PC's, also the charging cables are made of the same cheap material as the iPhone/iPod touch cables. In my experience with the iPhone, the charging cable became very frayed and I could see the wires and aluminum in the cord. WIth a seven hour battery life I would recommend keeping the charger in one spot at home and making sure your battery is full before you leave home, or buy a second cable for use at work or school. Maybe that will save the life of the cord and keep it from being frayed from too much movement. This mac does come with an extender cable and I'm using mine right now hoping the cable will stay nice for the many years I plan on using this mac. The part where the charger connects to a mac is a magnet and a strong one at that, be sure to keep your credit cards and cell phones away from it so it doesn't erase the data. I did read that in the fine print of the mac booklet. I might have read it incorrectly, but better safe than sorry right?Hope this helps!P.S. the camera DOES NOT look hot it does on TV! It's very pixely, I don't know if you can change the quality of the camera, BUT just a heads up. It may be because the room I use it in has poor lighting, but it could also be that the camera just isn't that good. What you see on TV is probably pre-recorded using a real camera.

Apple makes a fine product but, I have had very bad luck with them, and they are simply over priced.  For me, If this computer ran fast, stable and efficiently, it would have been worth the cost.  However, this has not been my experience so I am returning this product.I first purchased my macbook off of amazon and it ran glitchy out of the box.  The trackpad was erratic and unstable and programs crashed out of the box.  I contacted apple who gave me the typical line \"well, you have to buy it directly from us to be sure it is good\".  So I sent back my macbook and went through all the trouble of getting a return.  I purchased a new macbook at the inflated apple cost and got my second computer.  I soon realized that I was having more problems that were related to the operating system.  For one thing, I bought this computer to edit movies.  iMovie was a laughably bad program which was non-intuitive and hard to learn.  I shelled out the money to buy Adobe Premier which is an awesome program that I was able to figure out without seeking help.  Unfortunately, this particular program runs very glitchy on a mac.... but wait, I thought these computers were supposed to run these type of programs better than a PC.On top of that there is a massive learning curve when you are switching over from a PC to a Mac.  I don't care was Apple says, Macs are NOT more intuitive then PC's... especially when organizing files.  I ended up spending hours on the phone with apple care to learn how to perform system functions that should be intuitive enough to figure out on my own.  Now, don't get me wrong... this is NOT apple's fault.  Macs are different from PC's and they take time to learn.  However, what IS apple's fault is that they only give you a 14day return window when you order a 1500+ product from them.  This is insulting and unacceptable and is the main reason why I am sending back my second Macbook.  If I was given a more appropriate return window, I likely would have stuck with it but apple is twisting my arm to return it while I can still get my money back.So in the end, here is my final point.  Apple makes a fine product.  However, it has been my experience that shelling out the big bucks for this product DOES NOT GUARANTEE that you are going to escape the headaches of dealing with a PC.  My experience was that I had spent three times as much for buy a product that included the same headaches as a PC if not more.  Keep this in mind when you are purchasing one.  In the end, I think it is better to buy this product from amazon because they actually have a BETTER return policy than Apple themselves.", "Date": "May 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not happy", "Author": "Tina Shuemake", "ReviewID": "REA39C19IG9SB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After one week the main board fried - I guess this happens, but not often.

It downloaded them all in about a hour or so while dowloding other apps lisining to internet radio seting up email ect. I have setteld into it know and it is working very well. I use it to do the average persone may do and maybe a bit more. I love the backlit keybord and suprisingly doesnt drain the battery that much and remains around apples 7 or so hours.

So I want to join the chorus of praise for these excellent machines, dictating this review from my 11\" inch MacBook Air, my constant companion. Of course everything I do on my Air is shared with my MacBook Pro \"portable desktop\" as well as my iPod Touch, perhaps the most important thing about the Apple system.

Hunt \"Enjoying\"", "ReviewID": "R1DNRUOVUA4NJM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've owned a bunch of Macs over the last four years, switching over after 20 or so years of PCs. Initially, I loved my 13\" Macbook Pro and vowed never to go back to PCs. With my new 15\" Macbook Pro, I still won't go back to PCs and in general I really like my Mac, but I no longer love it. I have the new 2012 edition with 750 MB hard drive and 8 GB of RAM. It's quite fast but doesn't seem any where near as fast as it should be based on its rated speed. RAM should not be an issue with 8 GB but it regularly runs out and I have to use 3rd party software to free up RAM, whether I'm editing photos in iPhoto or Aperture or running Final Cut Pro X. It seems that Apple should by now have figured out how to cycle RAM in a way that constantly frees up older allocations and keeps space open for applications being used currently. Seriously.Most egregiously, I'm really pissed off with how computer makers consistently lie about battery life. The 2012 MacBook, as with the few generations before it, advertises a 7 or so hour life under normal use. I find this unconscionably off the mark. My Macs have NEVER lasted more than three hours on one charge under even light usage (Word, web, etc.), and generally last about 2 hours new. This is so far from seven hours I don't know how it's legal to advertise seven hours.Conclusion: I like my Mac (and I really like my Mac desktop), but I expect a lot more from Apple nowadays. Three stars out of five. And I'd appreciate any tips (beyond the obvious) for increasing battery life or managing RAM.Update 10/6: I forgot to add that it gets REALLY hot, to the point where I can't hold it on my lap. This is far hotter than any previous MacBook or Air that I have had has gotten. Even the palmrest gets really hot. This is a major defect that I can't believe Apple allowed.Update 10/20: I've changed this review to two stars because this new allegedly lightning fast MacBook is simply not fast. In fact, it's pretty damn slow and gets hung a lot. It's also started crashing entirely, which has never happened in any of my prior Macs.

I called Apple support, and after working with a Tier One advisor who was not very informed, I was escalated to a Tier Two advisor.This is my second experience in 20 years with Tier Two Apple support. The first in the 90s, the second in 2013. Both experiences are the best tech support I have ever experienced, by far. In this example, my router's firmware was old and needed updating. The advisor tried several things, then had me look at the router. He helped me update my router's firmware, even though my router is not an Apple product! Because that's what it would take to resolve my problem.I am not experiencing internet problems anymore. Apple has successfully turned a situation around from regretfully wanting to return my computer to being completely satisfied.I give 4 stars instead of 5 because of my experiences at the Apple Store and with the Tier One advisor. If they had taken me seriously, I would have been able to resolve the problem sooner.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I really want to give a good review. I had a mac in the 90s, back when only graphic artists and schools had them. It lasted for years, easy to upgrade.I cheaped out after that and bought several PC laptops, none of which lasted over 4 years. So, I decided to spend the dough and go back to a mac.I cannot maintain a wireless connection. Sometimes, it goes out every 3 minutes. Sometimes, if I'm lucky, I get as much as 20. Doing the research I, admittedly, should have done before purchase, I find that thousands of people are having the same problem.I have purchased a cheap wireless adapter, rather than do what the Apple store advised, which was to buy a new router (none of the other computers in my household have any problems). Hopefully, bypassing the mac's wireless capabilities will do the trick.But, that is pretty pathetic for an $1,100 machine, right? Plus, Apple seems to be in denial over the issue. They should at least be honest with their customers. Their own support forums are overflowing with people reporting this problem:[...][...][...][...][...][...]Like I said, I am far from a mac hater. I was really excited to receive this laptop, and I wish I could give it a good review. But wireless connectivity is mission critical. Sorry, Apple, this is a fail.

Clements", "ReviewID": "R1HPZO17IKV9J2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Let me preface this by saying I am a long time mac user. I've owned an iMac, Mac Mini, and now this MacBook Pro. All of which I have had great success with. However, apple isn't what it used to be. I've heard large production houses are slowly moving away from mac, but couldn't understand why. Now I know.First off, let me say that initial impressions of this were good, great look and feel, gorgeous display especially when calibrated, decent sounding speakers, and acceptable performance for 4gb RAM, a hard drive, and a dual core. It pretty much ends there.Over the corse of owning this computer (15 months), it has been to the apple store for repair 4 times, all relating to the main hard drive bay, the hard drive has been replaced twice, the cable once. I got tired of all of this shenanigans and decided to upgrade the thing myself. Bad move. While the hard drive and ram are considered \"user replaceable\" by apple, (they include guides on their website) replacing the hard drive is somewhat of a grey area and from what I was told if you break anything they will void your warranty and apple care. Replacing the optical drive is a huge no-no. I made the mistake of making it obvious that I had. I have a 64gb ssd in the hard drive bay, and moved the hard drive to the optical drive bay (who uses those anyway?). This was after my second visit to the apple store where the sata cable and hard drive had been replaced. This was working fine for almost a year, until roughly a week ago when I started to have the same issue I had before I went to the apple store, a grey screen with a circle and a x through it, indicating no boot drive. Turns out, the connection keeps cutting out. Go to the apple store, and it just works fine that day. That very night, I have the problem again. Take it to the apple store next day, stock and ready to go and I am informed that because I removed \"non-user-replacable\" parts, my $200 apple care was void. He then proceeded to tell me they couldn't even replace the data cable if we paid for it out of pocket, and that anything that would happen in the future I would have to pay for.$1400 on a laptop and they can't even support they crap they manufacture? I understand I replaced things I shouldn't have, but is all the crap really necessary? I returned it to stock and the issue wasn't even with the optical drive, but the hard drive. This is like buying a computer and a monitor and because you made an upgrade to the computer, the company saying they can't service the monitor. Complete crap. The fact that a company like this is riding on their reputation to carry them through everything and have to sue samsung to keep from going under is sad. The customer service for him to have the audacity to say it to my face that because I chose to upgrade something I own, they can no longer service it even if I pay for it has pushed me over the edge and I have listed every apple product I own on craigslist. Will be officially switching to PC, and never be buying from or recommending Apple to anyone again. No one should have to put up with this after spending that much money on a computer. They know they are a big company and that they don't have to care for anyone, just sell a cardboard box for several thousand dollars and refuse a refund. I can't believe after 10 years of mac use I'm saying this, but I really can't wait until the day Apple goes under.

Complete folly!  The bad experience started at the Apple Store.  I was told they could transfer data for me if I brought in my XPS.  \"For how long?,\" I asked.  \"Several days.\"  \"Not acceptable.  I have work to do.  What if I brought the two folders I want to transfer on an external drive?\"  \"Fine.\"  So I went home, updated the folders and came back.  \"Oh, we can only transfer from another computer, not from a drive.\"  So I purchased the computer and went home to set up and transfer data myself; I've never had any problems doing this in the past.  I get home again and go to archive and print-out my email receipt (which I need for an expense account).  The pdf would not open because of special Apple character sets and was just lines of splotches.  I went back a third time to the store to get a receipt.  The next day I opened the box and proceeded to set up.  After about an hour trying to work out how to assemble the two-piece power chord (no instructions) I got stuck on the data transfer stage; it could not recognize any connection to another computer or hard drive or flash drive.  I just decided I hated it and returned it for refund.  I remembered all my previous bad experiences with Apple: how terrible ITunes is, Apple library terminals on which it was impossible to back-page or scroll, and several lecturers I've seen humiliated because they brought their slide-show on an Apple, so could not connect to a digital projector (which apparently requires a mythical object called a \"dongle\" which no human has ever seen).  I have nothing good to say about Windows, but at least I've learned since the PC was invented to use its various iterations, and it can send emails, text, pdfs to other computers and be hooked up to a projector.  I will never try another Apple product.  I don't want to spend hundreds of hours in Apple University learning its counter-intuitive products.  Think of this: they're a tech company and they can't send an email!", "Date": "October 27, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,199.00", "Features": "2.5 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5 processor\n4 GB
