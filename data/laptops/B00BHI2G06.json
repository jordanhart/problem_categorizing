For the price it is a great sized screen and fast machine.  I mostly got this to check email, basic graphics editing, skype, word processing, and web browsing.At this time haven't had any issues.  The only thing keeping me from a five star rating is it is still pretty heavy for portability.

We took it to a computer repair place and when then tried to fix it they had to uninstall windows 8 and when they tried to reinstall the operating system it wouldn't install. I'm so fed up with this computer and gateway they put us on hold for ever and they just don't want to cooperate.

After only 2 months, it stopped working (I came to the conclusion that it's a faulty hard drive, after my own research). Gateway support sucks BIG TIME, all they can do is annoying you with their constant \"don't worry miss, we will help you with this issue\", but in the end, all they do is telling you to send in your laptop. Horrible I have to say, and after talking to three customer service reps, and many \"don't worry\" statements, I was really fed up.I bought this laptop for my daughter who is being home schooled and who's doing online classes, and since we're traveling a lot, losing her laptop after only 2 months was just unbelievable. We were on our way to Europe, so we had to send in the laptop to Texas, from Canada, and now we are not able to get the repaired laptop until we get back home. I can't blame Gateway for us traveling for several months of course, but the fact that their products are faulty is just a big turn off, and what was bad for me, that I only found out that Gateway = Acer, after the laptop failed, was even worse. If I had known this before, I would have never bought this laptop, because I had two Acer laptops before, and both of them died within a short time, and unfortunately, since we're traveling all over the world, we were out of warranty.So do yourself a favor, go buy yourself another laptop, and save yourself the headaches with this brand.", "Date": "July 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "gateway laptop", "Author": "ed vitkovich", "ReviewID": "R1TARW6CVCEFFD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Its working great but as promised it did not come with a 750 gig hard drive it has a 500gig and I was not happy about that.", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "I would love it if I didn't have to use Windows 8", "Author": "Regina P.", "ReviewID": "R3H7FZNAD1HKZ5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This laptop has been handy and reliable so far. For less than $400, including the 2 year extended warranty, I believe I got a fair deal. My use is pretty simple - a few websites to maintain, QuickBooks, Microsoft Office, internet, and email.
