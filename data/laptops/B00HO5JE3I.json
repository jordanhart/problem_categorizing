{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Best Blend of UltraBook and Multimedia Systems in One", "Author": "Matthew K. Morgan", "ReviewID": "R3HG4K7Q8NH3N8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At first glance the Asus VivoBook V551LA-DS17T appears to be a nice touch-screen UltraBook-class computer, but it is a few steps beyond a typical UltraBook. Combining features of UltraBook systems and multimedia/entertainment workstations, this computer is what new systems ought to be. There are a couple of design decisions I would change and it's by no means a high-end gaming rig, but Asus got the important things right.There are two things that set this system apart from a normal UltraBook. First is the inclusion of a slimline CD/DVD R/W drive. I have seen no other UltraBooks out there that include one, so finding one in this system was a very pleasant surprise. Carrying an external CD/DVD drive around can be inconvenient (especially when traveling) so having a built-in drive is a huge plus. Asus managed to include this drive in the system while still keeping the system to roughly an inch thick. The other differentiating factor that makes this system different than other UltraBooks I have seen (and not in a positive way) is the weight. This is a particularly heavy system and will make toting it around a chore.I booted up the system and configured it for use and immediately went about looking for the utility for making recovery/restore DVD media. After searching the file system and the installed program list with no success I finally resorted to calling technical support. I spoke to a charming young lady who was exceptionally helpful and got me on my way to creating a recovery USB drive. So, from that experience I can say that technical support is courteous and helpful. However, I never did figure out how to make DVD media, but at least I can restore the system now should I have a need to do so.After power-on for the first time it performed a bunch of hands-off updates and when it finished and finally allowed interaction with the OS it was loaded with Windows 8.1; it wasn't obvious if the initial OS install was 8 or 8.1 but that is irrelevant - 8.1 is what is there when the user can finally begin exploring the system. I spent a little time digging through the list of installed applications and was pleased to see that Asus did not load this system up with excessive bloatware. There are several applications I do not need and I intend to remove them - MS Office and McAfee protection services being among them - but at least what is there is not unreasonable. Interestingly, most new systems I have used have come with 1-2 years of internet security protection, but this system comes with just 30 days.One design decision that really surprised me is that this system does not include a solid-state drive (SSD). I understand the reason - it drives up cost - but to me having an SSD in this system would make it even faster and make the battery last longer. This is by no means a deal-breaker but bootup times are slower as a result.Asus makes a big deal about the touch screen on this system and touts it as more sensitive than most other touch screens. Asus' claims appear to be well-founded as the other touch screen systems available to me are nowhere near as responsive. After spending a couple of hours working with this system I unplugged my trackball and I don't think I will need it again for this particular system. If you are buying this system for the ability to use the touch screen, you will be pleased.Battery life so far is excellent. I charged the system up completely and spent a good three hours using it for web surfing and typing up documents and the battery still maintains more than half of its charge. I plan to load up my development environment and see how the battery holds up under load, and I expect that to make the battery drain faster, but for typical use (surfing the web, writing document and watching online videos) the battery seems to be very much in the game.The graphics system is provided by the Intel chipset and it is acceptable for most uses. It's not high end graphics but it's not terrible either. Serious gamers will not appreciate this system whereas most casual gamers and people using the system for more business-types of functions will be more than satisfied. As an experiment I had my teenage son load up Minecraft (an online game that uses 1st-person perspective) and test the graphics. He noticed that while the game played well enough it is not quite as smooth as a system that has a dedicated graphics card.Wi-Fi connection speed seems to be about average with other wireless-n devices on the network.One thing that really startled me is the quality of the sound system. Asus says that this is the best configuration for embedded sound available and I found the sound quality coming from the embedded speakers to be more than acceptable. The speakers are on the bottom of the unit and are visible via two inch-long slits in the case. In spite of the small aperture, the output is very good, better than one would expect.With the slimline DVD and the decent sound quality, paired with the i7 processor and 8GB RAM this system is well-suited for multimedia tasks such as video production and music creation. It has the horsepower to handle the renders and so far has performed well while working on either audio or video composition. As I mentioned above I expect these types of activities to take more battery than less strenuous tasks but I have not spent enough time with these types of applications on this system yet to determine just how much they will impact battery life.The touch pad is a bit better than average and is placed well. One issue I have with most laptops is that I tend to tap the touch pad while typing and on occasion I can highlight and delete a whole section of text unintentionally. So far this has not been a problem with this system and I think it has a lot to do with the way the touch pad is positioned relative to the open space on the keyboard. Asus includes a very nice utility (accessible by a special key on the keyboard) that makes turning the touch pad on and off very simple, so it's easy to eliminate any issue with it if it's \"in the way\" while typing.The power adapter is odd and I am not sure I like it. The shape requires a little planning as it is a square block pressed against the wall when it is plugged in. Most adapters typically have the brick in the middle. So, plugging this adapter in when working in a cramped space could potentially pose a challenge. Another observation - the adapter gets rather warm.I do not like the way the hard drive is partitioned right out of the box. It appears that the drive was simply chopped into two roughly equal partitions, the D: drive labeled as \"data\". I would rather have one large drive, instead of two smaller ones. This is a personal preference though and I am sure most will be indifferent.I decided to toss in a Linux LiveCD and boot it up to see how well supported the touch screen is with a current distribution. The system refused to boot from it initially; to get it to boot I had to turn off Secure Boot in the BIOS after which I was able to boot up from the DVD. My distribution of choice for this experiment was Mint 16 with the Cinnamon Desktop. I found that there is basic support in place for the screen, though only as a standard pointing device (a lot like using a Wacom tablet) and not as a swipe and gesture interface. There are other distributions out now that are geared more towards tablets; I will try one of those and see how well it works out. That said, the fact that the desktop at least recognizes the screen as a pointing device and properly responds to it is a good thing.A few other technical details: The system has 3 USB ports (two of them USB 3.0 and one of them USB 2.0), an HDMI port, an Ethernet port (which is not a given anymore when it comes to notebook computers), an audio out and a SD card reader. Given a choice I would have liked to have a VGA or DVI port to put the display on a second screen but that's not something I have seen on the most recent systems.Asus has put together a very nice UltraBook-like system in this notebook. It's a nice workhorse for most uses and the touch screen is absolutely wonderful. The system's a bit hefty though and might prove to be cumbersome for those on the go, and the graphics system is not at serious gaming level, but the system is a solid performer and provides the best features of an UltraBook and a multimedia workstations in one place.", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Another ASUS quality notebook you can rely on", "Author": "Y. Kim \"Zelium\"", "ReviewID": "R3DKXEDJG9S0FS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ever since I have interested in assembling my own computers, Asus has been big name for me. I always chose their motherboards for any self-assembled desktop computer for me and my friend.  That legacy continued to notebook computers and I have recommended the notebooks from them to many friends and have not had a complaint from them.  I have that much belief in their product and they proved it once again with the ASUS VivoBook V551LA-DS71T.  I have been using the VivoBook V551LA-DS71T for about a month now and want to share my experience with you.First of all, I would not categorize the VivoBook V551LA-DS71T as an ultrabook.  My own definition of ultrabook is a notebook computer that weigh less than 3 pounds.  The VivoBook V551LA-DS71T is 5.3 pounds and that is way heavier than my ultrabook standard.  But the VivoBook V551LA-DS71T is a very slim notebook and compared with other 15.6 notebooks on the market, it is (ultra) light.  And it did come with DVD/CD recordable drive and this was quite exceptional for (ultra) slim notebooks.  I liked to have an optical drive without adding much depth to the notebook and this could be the clincher for some people.I have used the VivoBook V551LA-DS71T for popular applications like web browers and Microsoft Office products.  It just worked flawlessly with super fast response.  I did not run CPU-hungry applications like video encoding tools, 3D modeling software or any commercial simulation software that I do at work yet.  I bet the VivoBook V551LA-DS71T is more than enough for the day-to-day applications and i7 CPU will shine once you run serious applications.  I ran the database management system like MySQL with pretty decent size data and did not notice any speed degradation compared with the octa-core Xeon CPU desktop I use at work.  And for the graphics, if the system can run 1080p video without any frame skipping or stuttering, I would be happy and the VivoBook V551LA-DS71T played 1080p full HD videos very well.The one thing that the VivoBook V551LA-DS71T impressed me was that it was super cool (I mean, temperature) during the operations.  From my experiences, slim notebooks like this could get easily hot and you would feel heat on a palm rest, around the keyboard or the bottom part.  However, the VivoBook V551LA-DS71T was running very cool and I did not feel much heat while I was running 1080p HD video for an hour or two.  And the sound coming out from the VivoBook V551LA-DS71T was also very good.  They advertise the sound system as 'SonicMaster' and I can cleary feel the difference by comparing side by side with my other notebooks including Macbook Pro and Lenovo ThinkPad.  Specially, the bass sound was very rich and the ambience was top-notch.I am not a fan of a touch screen. If it is a tablet, I would be OK, but for the notebook computers, I just hate to leave fingerprints on the display.  I even clean the display as frequent as possible with the cleaning cloth came with the VivoBook V551LA-DS71T.  But I tried it for the testing purpose and the sensitivity was very good.  Since the VivoBook V551LA-DS71T came with Windows 8.1 (not 8 on the product description), touch screen might give you better experience to use.  But, I am not crazy about Windows 8.1 either, so I have not touched the screen after the initial test and will not try it ever.The trackpad offered some gestures and I liked the size of it.  However, two thumbs scrolling was not very smooth like the one provided on a Macbook.  Windows 8.1 sets right/left swipe to switch apps or to bring up recently used apps by default, so if you are like me who hates unwanted app popping up, you should disable it in the touchpad property.  It really bothered me and my wife and I found that other people near me had similar problems. This was not Asus' fault so I do not blame them.My gripes for the VivoBook V551LA-DS71T were all screen related.  First, the resolution of 1366*768 for a 15.6 inch display is just too low.  I felt like I was living in a big house with a one-car garage.  I wanted to see more information on this nice, big and glossy display. 1600*900 would not be a bad idea for this size and it was my preference, so your experience might be different from me.  My other gripe was that the display had too much reflection.  I knew that the reflection was a common issue for all glossy display, however, the VivoBook V551LA-DS71T had more reflection than other notebooks I have.  If you put the VivoBook V551LA-DS71T on a desk and see it from 5 foot or further, you might end up seeing your face better than the contents on the display.And the VivoBook V551LA-DS71T did not come with a backlit keyboard.  But I was OK with the touch of the keys and the layout.  Having a separate numeric keys has been always a blessing for my work.Overall, the VivoBook V551LA-DS71T is a great notebook computer with Asus quality.  8gb main memory is plenty and 750gb hard drive space is good enough.  Slim and sleek design, fantastic temperature control and awesome sound, all built inside of 1 inch thickness silver aluminium housing.  If you are looking for a notebook with big display, optical drive built-in, and powerful yet cool (no-heat), this must be it.", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Ultrabook Plus", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"epiamy\"", "ReviewID": "RATH0KJKUTQJE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Asus VivoBook V551LA-DS17T is a touch-screen UltraBook that has some multimedia functionality. First, it actually has a CD/DVD drive (read/write), which is relatively unique for UltraBooks, although there is not a huge increase in base width compared to other UltraBooks. The more powerful UltraBook rig did actually run Elder Scrolls Online and Lord of the Rings although performance was a little sluggish. It performed better than expected.It also ran a full version of ArcGIS, but again, performance wasn't fantastic. It certainly will do in a pinch.Because of the upped specs and included drive, it is slightly heavier than most UltraBooks (1.5# heavier) but lighter than most multimedia machines (~2#). The touch screen is sensitive, but not more so than my Acer,, at least not that I've noticed. It came pre-loaded with 8.1 (which was nice - the last 8 to 8.1 conversion took a much longer time than expected!) which has been updated again. The touchpad is easy to use and smooth.When gaming, the bottom did get hot, but not unreasonably so. Battery life is good, especially for light use of Office products. It has 2 USB 3.0 and 1 USB 2.0 hub and of course, an SD reader. There is only a small amount of \"bloatware\" installed and it comes off easily.Overall, if you're looking for a midrange machine with an included DVD/CD read/write drive, this is a solid contender. It will do many heavy lifting tasks (albeit slowly) but is better suited for a casual user who wants more power for some multimedia tasks.", "Date": "May 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Don't buy this computer.", "Author": "Jason Brown", "ReviewID": "R2MFZ3IPSPHE0F", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this computer a few weeks ago. It looks amazing - clean lines, sharp. This is the first time that I have spent $700 on a new laptop. I wanted to splurg. I was so excited. I use the Num Pad a lot and Asus is one of the few that offer it.BAD IDEA. This computer is VERY slow to open documents, load websites (on a 50 Mbps wired connection) and seems clunky despite boasting a Intel Core i7 4500U 1.8 GHz processor. My HP from 5 years ago is lightning fast with a Pentium dual core E5800 @ 3.2 GHz.The space bar doesn't work unless you bang on it.I admittedly use the bottom right portion, so you could argue it's my fault. It's a spacebar. It should work wherever I push it.The touchscreen is useless in terms of function and the mousepad is erratic at best.Your money would be better spent buying another product. I am going to try and return it, to which I am sure I will be hit with an outrageous restocking fee because I actually used the computer before returning it. How do companies expect you to test something without actually using it?The speakers are amazing, the screen is clean and clear. Battery life was solid. Didn't have any issues with Wi-Fi or bluetooth. It looks awesome, but that's as far as it goes. If there weren't so many issues with the keypad and mouse I would just deal with the slow processing speeds. Stay away. Didn't give it 1 star because it's got solid features, the bad just outweigh the good.", "Date": "May 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Absolutely wonderful", "Author": "Carol Toscano", "ReviewID": "R1L4JNDGVIQRPI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I review this as an ordinary user and not a technical specialist.The Asus VivoBook V551LA-DS17T is a superior class touch-screen computer, with a good amount of multimedia capability and the most amazing touch screen sensitivity I've used. Honestly, I've not experienced a touch screen like this one. I absolutely LOVE the touch screen.The setup was very minimal and pretty much ready to go just about as soon as I removed the packaging. I was very happy to have such a slim, sleek computer come configured with an internal cd/dvd drive (my HP needs a separate drive and I find it annoying, in general). I didn't take out a ruler but this laptop is very thin, under an inch, I'd say. And the screen quality while viewing media is the best I've ever seen and the sound quality is also superior to other systems I've had. The physical design of this is really quite nice.This comes pre-installed with Windows 8 and I'm still in the learning stages with it but getting better each day. Not an overload of bloatware but there is some, so FYI. Also, initial boot up seems slower than other systems but not to the point where it makes me angry. The battery life is exceptional - I had it on continuously for nearly 8 hours before it really went down. Comes with 30 days of internet security but that's fine since I have my own.The touch pad is responsive and comfortable to use but I find myself using the touch screen more than the touch pad, in general. The touch pad is extremely sensitive so I need to be careful not to inadvertently delete work I'm doing. But, it's just a matter of becoming accustomed to the sensitivity and I think it will be fine.Additionally, the system is configured with an SD card reader (something I use a lot), two USB 3.0s and one USB 2.0, Ethernet (which I never use anymore), an HDMI port, and webcam camera.I don't particularly like the power cord with its big, awkward square adapter. I try to use the system on battery most of the time to avoid having to deal with the awkwardness of this but it is what it is. While the actual system didn't get too hot during long periods of use, the power adapter did become a bit warm after a while.The only other downside to this is the weight, which is a bit heavy (over 5 lbs). Better for use at home than for dragging around. But really, for the overall quality, this is insignificant (to me at least) in the bigger picture. This might matter to people who are looking for a lightweight system, though.I'm exceptionally impressed by the Asus VivoBook and can recommend it unconditionally.
