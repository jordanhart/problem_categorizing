It packs a 3rd generation core i5 processor and the speed is great.PROS1. Cheap and really affordable considering what it is packed with.2. Very light and easy to carry around.3. Really fast to set up and boot4. Does not heat up even when I run high end 3D programs like solidworks. good cooling system.5. Good battery life of up to 5 hours under power saver mode. CONS1. It has a really cheap feel and the keyboard keys are a bit smaller than the usual keyboard keys especially the enter key.2. It froze on the second day of usage and I had to do a hard reset.3. All the USB ports are on one side of the laptop and really close to each other. So if you have an usual sized flash drive, you could only use two ports because there might be no space for the third.Well, If you are looking for a nice laptop for good performance but not will to spend too much, This is it!", "Date": "August 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "So far, so good.", "Author": "Brent M. Sallee \"Brent Sallee\"", "ReviewID": "R289KLYG03R4HW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm not quite sure why there are two reviews giving a one-star and three-star review for minor issues. This laptop, at $560, is very nice. Others brands have laptops with these specs for over $700 easy. It's lightweight, quiet, and quick. Granted, there are some design flaws: USB ports mashed together on the left hand side, keyboard slightly smaller than usual with sometimes sticky keys, touchpad without mouse buttons (would have liked mouse buttons). However, the functionality of the computer is great - it's quick, it's cool (doesn't heat up to 100+ degrees like some I've used), it's chic (simple design, but nice), lightweight, and the sound isn't too bad either. You're not gonna want this computer if you want to do hardcore gaming on it, but it's wonderful for students and general use. The keyboard comes with a full number pad on the right, which deviates the keyboard slightly to the left. I wish they would have left the number pad off and just made the standard keyboard bigger, but these are minor problems. Compared to other computers I've spent over $900 on, it's good. I wouldn't say it feels cheap, like others have mentioned. I like it so far. If anything goes wrong, I will definitely report back here.", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Outstanding Semi-Budget Laptop", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2P8Y6LP9LDKN6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent laptop for those on a $500-$600 budget.  It features a brand new 3rd generation \"Ivy Bridge\" Intel Core i5 processor.  Nothing slow about it.  In general, the laptop looks and feels like a more expensive piece of hardware.  Very thin, sleek look.  Light as a feather.  Because of the relatively thin bezel encasing the display, it sort of feels bigger than it actually is.  Keyboard is very nice and sturdy, easy to get used to for fast typing.  Trackpad looks and feels like a Macbook.  All in all, it is one hell of a nice laptop.  This can be purchased at Office Depot in store if you're interested in checking it out before you buy it.

I was so surprised of the thinness of this product and the specs that it has given (3rd gen 1.7 ghz i5) at a very competative price (got it for $499).PROS:-Very Thin for a 15.6 inch Laptop.-Has 3rd Gen i5 Intel Chip.-Surprisingly small power block/lightweight cord.-Screen has Great Colors (Not saturated like others).-Minimalistic Style (You have an option to change its appearance easily).-Heat and Noise transfer to hand are so Minimal (you just can't put a gel cover over the keyboard as they design the airflow  to go thru the \"Keyboard's outlines\" passing thru the left side where the fan outputs the airflow).-LIGHTWEIGHT compared to other 15.6 inch Laptops (Because the Structure/body is made of Hard Plastic.. which... also made the price of this item affordable).-HD Webcam is cool.-Suprisingly light and small Power Block to charge the Laptop.CONS:-Laptop Body is Made of Hard Plastic which makes the Hardware looks and feels cheaply (which made the price of this item lower).-TrackPad was good but not Great.-Dongle for Ethernet/VGA Monitor Port (which I understand to make the design slimmer).-A bit slower albeit it has a 6gb of RAM in a i5 Chipset 1.7 ghx turbo boost to 2.6 (which I easily fix by putting 2 X 8gb which equals to 16gb total making it more Responsive)-a LOT OF BLOATWARE (some useful; some not).-Keyboard is crampy so you may sometimes accidentally hit the TrackPad (but with a little practice; its duable).-Sound coming from the speakers feels too much Treble (but it is louder than my VAIO E and the Dolby Surround Works which is tweakable by the way).I GAVE IT A 5 STAR BECAUSE..-The Price (which some of the suspected Cons outweighs the Pros of this Laptop).-The thinness and lightweight.-It serves the purpose of why a purchase this item which is an affordable; on the go, lightweight computer without me worrying about the value of this item if ever it gets stolen (Not using this for any financial transactions which I use my home computer to do that. Only for Web Surfing/ some emails and some Picture editing).HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR people who would want an affordable, thin lightweight 2nd Laptop on the go with the Internal Performance of a highly Spec. Computer.

Only thing is that the mouse pad is a bit annoying to use because it doesn't have buttons on the bottom of the pad. The computer runs fast and smoothly.

I also wanted Windows 7, since all my other computers use it. I found that the Acer Aspire V5-571-6869 fitted what I was looking for. Amazon had considerable choice available--new once, though they tended to be costly, and used and refurbished. I chose to go with refurbished by he manufacturer with a 3-month warranty, and there chose to explore not the cheapest available but the next one. I am really glad I did--the seller was knowledgable, had clearly checked out each of his computers thoroughly, had gotten rid of bloatware and installed reputable free software, and was eager to be helpful--for example, he sent it in to arrive in two days without adding to the cost, and was willing to take calls if help was needed with any problem or set-up.

Unfortunately it is a bad one.Here is what happened. I have been using a Kensington lock for the last five years for my previous laptop. After I bought this laptop, I started using the lock for the new laptop. I could feel that the lock slot didn't fit the lock in the first few times I used it. And then when I used it the last time a week back, it got stuck and I am not able to pull it out ever since.I used the same combination for the last five years and my colleague have several of the same locks and we use them over the years without any issues until this thing came up. I talked to Amazon and they asked to talk to Acer first, which intended to blame the lock. But I am pretty sure it is the problem with the design of the lock slot. Otherwise, I would have problem with my previous laptop and my colleague would also have problems as we switch laptops all the time.Anyway, Acer doesn't want to be responsible for this issue and I will see if Amazon will eventually stand behind the product they sell.Besides the lock slot issue, the laptop is a bit slow even with a 3rd generation i5 and 6 GB of RAM. It got frozen a few times already within three weeks of usage.The thing I dislike most about the laptop is its keyboard, which is very sticky and so awkward to use. I thought I could get used to it after a while but I still can not after three weeks. One of my co-workers complained about the keyboard when he just tried to type one sentence. \"I hate it\" was his original word.The viewing angle of the laptop is also so narrow and I have to change the screen from time to time to have a clearer view.I will have to return it to Amazon and hope they can give me full refund as the purchase was made less than a month ago.Some pros:  light and thin with a decent price tag.", "Date": "August 22, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00811VCMK"}}
