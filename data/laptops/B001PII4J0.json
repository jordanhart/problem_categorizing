{"Reviews": [{"Title": "great computer if portability matters", "Author": "citizen insane", "ReviewID": "RPFIXZWHJE1AZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've always been a fan of ultraportable computers, and I've owned a few, which include a Motion LS800 tablet, Raon Everun, Vaio TX, Vaio TZ, and an Asus 1000H.  So, my review is based upon my experience with those machines.  The Vaio P, in my opinion, is the ideal combination of portability and functionality, if typing is an integral part of your computing needs.  I bought 2 of them (one for me, one for the wife) as soon as they were announced on the Sony website, and have been using it for about 2 weeks.PRO'S:(1) SCREEN RESOLUTION: One issue that I have always had with any ultraportable (outside of the Vaio TX and TZ) has been low screen resolution (e.g. 1028 x 680), which has always lead to lots of scrolling and/or zooming-out.  The resolution on the Vaio P is, in one word, incredible.  EVERY webpage is viewable in its entirety on the screen, as is EVERY document I need to read or edit.  The downside is that text ends up being VERY small on the screen, but still legible to me (I type documents in 10-pt Times New Roman font).  However, there is a personalization option available that allows you to make text/icons 125% larger than normal, which makes things much easier to see.  My wife wears glasses and has trouble reading the text at normal settings, so she uses that mode and it works well for her.(2) PORTABILITY: Okay, let's not kid ourselves here.  This thing will NOT fit in your shirt/pants pocket (unless you're wearing very baggy cargo pants), but it will fit in a purse or any small satchel.  Weight is negligible, even with the extended-life battery attached.  Portability is a big thing for me in my profession (medical student, MD in a few months), and this machine can easily fit in the pocket of my white coat when I'm on the move.(3) THE KEYBOARD: I type extensively as part of my profession, and having a usable keyboard is a component that has always been missing from any computer that I could carry on my person.  My Motion tablet and Everun were useful for reading on-the-go, but essentially useless for typing anything beyond a short phrase.  My Vaio TX/TZ have great keyboards (I've typed thousands of pages on them), but the machines themselves are too large to carry on me at all times.Let me also take this opportunity to point out that, in comparison to the Asus 1000H, the Vaio P is not just another crappy netbook.  The keyboard on the 1000H, for many reasons, is a low-quality component that definitely shows with heavy use.  Any typing mistakes made with the Vaio P are genuinely my own keystroke mistakes, which was not the case with the Asus (90% of the time, it was just the junky keyboard causing mistakes).  The right-shift key on the Vaio P is truncated, but its placement to the left of the arrow keys makes it a much more natural motion to hit, and something that you can become accustomed to without causing you to alter your typing accuracy on a normal-sized keyboard, which was really just impossible with the 1000H (that had the right shift key placed to the right of the arrow keys).(4) FUNCTIONALITY: It is a fully-functional PC, capable of running any program you might need to run, given that you're not trying to use this as a gaming PC.  I have installed Windows 7 on my Vaio P, which has made it much more efficient at running multiple programs simultaneously, as well as improving stability.  I would highly recommend this upgrade for anyone purchasing this machine.CONS:(1) VISTA: This machine should have come standard with XP.  Vista boot time is horrendously slow, even from hibernation, and installing Windows 7 does not fix this problem.  My other ultraportables running XP were able to return from hibernation in about 20-60 seconds.  The Vaio P takes probably 2-3 minutes.  Maybe I'm a little impatient, but I want my computer to be ON when I turn it on.  The integrated instant-on technology is not terribly useful to me because I generally need to use programs other than Media player or Firefox when I fire my machine up.(2) NOT USER-UPGRADEABLE: As I understand it, the RAM is soldered to the motherboard and thus not upgradeable.  3 GB of RAM would have made the VAIO P much faster, and would have alleviated problem (1) I described above, and with 3 GB of RAM, Windows 7 would not even be a necessity because it would then be able to run Vista acceptably.(3) STANDARD BATTERY LIFE: Sony touts 4 hours of life with the standard battery, which is of course a lie.  It's more like 2.5 to 3 hours with screen brightness turned down to 1 or 2 (at which it is still very much readable/viewable), with WiFi on.  I also have the large capacity battery, which takes it to 6.5 to 7 hours at the same settings.  The large capacity battery adds maybe 1 to 1.5 cm of height to the machine, which is something of an eyesore, but I will make the sacrifice because the added battery life is worth more to me than the 0.2 lbs (not noticeable) and increased size.(4) LACK OF TOUCHPAD: This omission is well-documented in other reviews; the pointing stick does what it is intended to do and it does it well -- however, it does NOT replace the touchpad or a mouse.  Most people are already well-aware of this issue before purchasing the Vaio P.  One thing I would liked to have seen instead is the optical mouse like on the Raon Everun, which is an intuitive and exceptional pointing device that is easier to use than the pointing stick.*CONCLUSION: the Vaio P is an exceptional device of modern engineering that allows its owners to maintain productivity at a level comparable to that of a laptop while away from home, or when lugging a laptop case is impractical -- thus, I must stress that it is intrinsically a COMPANION PC.  One should not expect this to REPLACE a primary PC, nor should one anticipate using this as their laptop 100% of the time, 24/7, because it simply would be foolish and needlessly uncomfortable to do so.  I would make the analogy of comparing WiFi to a T1 connection -- given the choice and availability, no one would choose WiFi over a T1 connection, but the convenience and mobility of a WiFi connection are advantages that the T1 cannot match.  In the same way, the Vaio P offers unmatched portability and convenience, but its purpose is of a different nature than the primary laptop/desktop -- so, as long as you keep that difference in mind, the Vaio P should enhance your productivity and live up to its tag of being a \"lifestyle\" PC.", "Date": "February 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great laptop, but not for everybody", "Author": "Juan Alvarez \"Latin American Road Warrior and...", "ReviewID": "R36OCN6YVXXR9G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was one of the first people to buy one of these and have been using it since the beginning of February.  (Bought the VGN-P530H)  This is my main computing device that I use 12-16 hours a day and I love it, but it is not for everybody.I travel a lot, nearly all of it internationally, and often in economy.  This is a laptop that you can use on the smallest of tray tables, even with the seat in front of you fully reclined.  I bought the leather pouch accessory and often carry the laptop around in it.  It's great to just be able to walk by my desk, toss it in the pouch and go to a meeting and then pull it out if I need it.  Since it is only about the size of a notepad, it's easy to carry around everywhere, to situations I wouldn't want the bother of a laptop bag.The laptop appears sturdily built for the rigors of road warrior travel.  Since February, I've flown more than 50K miles with it, including a 2 week vacation in Japan where we visited 11 cities.  It's taken its fair share of bumps and doesn't show it.  I originally bought this for my wife but began using it as my own when my company provided Dell E4200 broke in its 3rd week (the monitor backlighting electronics burned out).  While the monitor lid is not thicker than other models, it seems to be more resilient because of the smaller surface area.The Vaio P is visually attractive.  When using it in the executive lounge in the airport or on a plane, people will often come up to ask what model it is.  The screen quality is amazing, especially when you consider they packed 1600x768 pixels into that tiny screen.  You'll need 20-20 vision or better to be able to comfortably read this screen, which will be a deal breaker for lot of people.  If you're unsure, try one out in a store before buying.  Setting the icons and text to a larger size can help.  One of the things that I don't like about the laptop is that it does not have and lower resolutions that are in proportion.  For example, the next lower resolutions are 1024x768 and 800x600 which appear distorted since they are out of proportion compared to the native resolution.  There are times when I'm in a bumpy car or somewhere else with a lot of motion and use the 800x600, but it would be nice if they had something more proportional like 800x400 or 1024x500.Love the keyboard and the pointer stick (I can't stand track pads).  The right shift key is unusually sized and placed, it drove me nuts for about 2 weeks until I got used to it.The power adaptor is small.  There are no ports for Ethernet and VGA on the laptop, you need to plug in the included dongle for that.  The dongle is fairly small and clips on to the power adaptor brick.  The only thing I didn't like about the dongle is that it does not have little LEDs on the Ethernet port that show the status of the Ethernet connection.  This is a useful features for travelers - to know more quickly if the port you plugged into is live or not.The laptop came with Verizon 3G, which has a nice prepaid option where you can buy service for $9.95 a day, without entering into a contract, which is nice compared to buying WiFi access in hotels, since you can use it anywhere you have coverage for the day.  (I didn't find any coverage holes on my trips to southern California, Chicago, Northern Virginia, Baltimore and Miami)  However, since most of my travel is outside the US, where the card does not seem to work, this is a mostly useless feature for me and it would have been nice to be able to trade it for something more useful like, GPS.A few things I didn't like:The main issue we had with the laptop was poor performance with Windows Vista.  As installed, it is unacceptably slow for regular everyday use.  We installed the beta of Windows 7 on the laptop and it is working fine.  Installing Windows 7 on the laptop is a breeze, the only drivers I downloaded were for the video and the network.  I have been running with this laptop as my main computer for the last few weeks (on Windows 7) and the performance is not an issue opening web pages, outlook, powerpoint, excel and word at the same time.  Things will start to slow down with too many (e.g., 8 Firefox windows, outlook, 2 powerpoint presentations and 3 excel sheets) - closing a few windows will bring back the zippiness.  We didn't get the SSD and I wouldn't bother.  I keep a fast 32GB SDHC card in the SD bay to increase the storage size since 64GB can be a little limiting.The battery life is not great - with WiFi on, I get less than 2 hours battery life.  A little more than 2 hours with the WiFi off.  The power adaptor outputs a non-standard voltage: 10.5V, so you will not be able to use it with nearly any universal power supply or universal laptop batteries (like the ADC).  Together with the low battery life, this is a serious problem on trips.A word to the wise, contrary to some misleading information on the Vaio website, this laptop does *not* come with GPS or any navigation software.  I was very disappointed about this, as the website intro to this product implies they have it and the sales rep that sold me my laptop over the phone confirmed that the laptop definitely does come with GPS.  To the best of my knowledge, none of the P-series laptops Sony is selling in North America come with GPS.  We came very close to returning the laptop for this reason alone.  Another thing to be wary about - the sales rep tried to sell me an Ethernet/VGA dongle when the laptop already comes with one.The WiFi card does not support 5GHz WiFi N - this is disappointing in a brand new premium laptop since this has been available on many laptops since the middle of last year.  Also, the laptop does not have an easily found serial number on the bottom.  This may sound nitpicky, but it's a problem for those of us that visit buildings that require registering the laptops with a serial number before entering and upon leaving.In summary, this may sound like a lot of things not to like for someone who loves the laptop, but I wanted to be complete as this laptop is not for everybody.  I love the smaller size and that for such a small size it has such a nice keyboard, screen resolution and reasonable performance on Windows 7.  More memory, a faster processer and a larger disk would be nice, but I can get by.  The bigger problem is the battery life and I'll probably be getting an extended battery in the future to solve that.  The Vaio P is also reasonably rugged - my last 2 laptops were a Dell E4200 and a Sony TZ-200 both of which developed screen problems and needed repair on my first or second trip with them (and neither suffered any significant abuse).  I'd give it 4 stars, but am docking Sony 1 star for being misleading about the GPS.", "Date": "April 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Ultra-portable Netbook Ever.", "Author": "Joon Y.

But this was my first try with \"netbook.\" This products has a great features, style, and size and that's one of the reason I bought this netbook.  There are some pros and cons about this and I'll let you know to help you on purchasing this item.pros:1. The Size: size of this product is just amazing. There are few other netbooks came out but this is the smallest. Very handy and portable. I mean who's gonna beat the size of 9.65\" x 4.72\" x 0.78\" and the weight of 1lb 4.8oz?  The only thing is, it's not going to fit on your hip pocket, like it advertised. But It will fit on your hand just fine, or for girls, it will fit on your small purse.2. The resolution:  Most of the netbooks came out with the screen resolution of 1028 x 680, but Sony made this 1600 x 768, which provides more comfortable views for users. Although, the 8 inch screen is kindda too small for that resolution, you might feel tired after looking at the screen for long time.3. The instant booting system:  The instant booting system (based on Linux system) takes about 15 seconds to boot up, you can browse websites, watch movies or listen to musics.  You can also boot up the computer to windows mode from there.  This comes very handy.Cons:1. Sony just had to make it with the Vista.  The performance goes dramatically down running Vista on this product.  You can also downgrade it to XP, which makes VAIO P much faster to perform, but you will find lags watching movies because there's no GMA 500 chip set driver for XP. The best way to use VAIO P is to upgrade its operating system to Windows 7, overall performance was very nice. Although, it might be slower than XP, you can use GMA 500 driver and overall performance is good.2. VAIO P is using 1.33GHz Z520 Intel Atom Processor.  This chip set makes VAIO P not able to perform as fast as other laptops, but for netbooks, it is pretty fast.3. The price of this is about $1,000 when most of netbook's price is around $500. I don't think VAIO P performs twice as much as other netbooks, but the design of it is more than twice as much as other products.4. HD (Hard Disk) performance is much lower than SSD (Solid State Disk) performance. I think it'd be much better to choose SSD model if you want to buy this. Bad about it is the capacity. It only holds 60GB for HD, and 64GB for SSD.Overall, This is a netbook that I personally thought of best. I think this is definitely not for the main computer, but great for sub-computer. It comes very handy and portable, so if you are looking for a sub-computer (or laptop), this is one of the best.", "Date": "February 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Horribly slow...real bummer", "Author": "Red", "ReviewID": "R3G85BCKN1VUCP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is such a nicely made laptop. Awesome style, beautiful design..not a bad price considering Sony Vaio's past history. The text is going to be small and it's something you will have to deal with if you want the portability.You can increase the font size but I didn't like how it distorted some of the graphics. Keyboard is decent as well for the size. It does tend to run really hot so I doubt there is any cooling system in this tiny little package.The pointer mouse also takes some getting used to. My biggest gripe is how incredibly slow this thing is. I had the Vaio TX series before this one and it  too was impossible to run on Vista. I agree this needs to be downgraded to XP. In my experience I have not had too many pc's that ran well on Vista anyway. As a matter of fact I just installed Windows 7 Ultimate on an Acer Aspire One and that seems to work better than Vista as well. I might try that first before I switch this to XP. I may end up returning this if it continues to be slow. My $300 Acer runs so much better out of the box than this one.

It functions pretty well for what it's suppose to be, which is a NetBook (sorry Sony).  ...so keep that in mind, do not buy this if what you really need is a laptop, cause you can get laptops that perform way better than the Vaio P at half its cost.  I believe that the unit is representing what a NetBook should be, and hopefully setting a benchmark for future NetBooks.Here's my personal experience if anyone cares...I should mention that I do not have this specific unit, but instead the VGN-P598E/Q, which is the same as this with the exception of a 128GB Solid State; performance wise, no major difference between this model sold by Amazon.com.  The only reason why I went the extra mile was because I really need the space.  The unit has not disappointed me very much yet, sure it can't really play HD video on YouTube or Hulu, or iTunes movies. but that's ok to me, because I need it for productivity.  ...so that's an other thing to keep in mind when buying this movie if you're a movie fanatic or plan on watching movies while traveling.  I use mine to run work related software, and some of that software can be a bit demanding and this little unit can handle it.  THe software I run includes SQL, SharePoint Designer, Visual Studio 2008, the whole Microsoft Office Suite, Adobe CS4, FileMaker Pro 9, iTunes (for music while I work LOL) and others.  ...sure, I do prefer to run these on my iMac, and even my MacBook Air runs them better, but if I'm on the go, I see no reason why I should carry a bigger laptop (I know, the MacBook Air only weighs 1.5lbs more, but it's still bigger), so I decided to get the Sony Vaio P.  If I ever need to give a demo, no problem, the Vaio P ships with a little dongle that lets you plug a VGA monitor or projector into it (that's also the solution if you think the font is to small, or just use the zoom feature)....that's sort of how I use the Vaio P, and it has yet to fail me.Sure, it might be a bit slow, but not super slow.  I do admit that I had higher expectations, and was disappointed to find out videos aren't handled so well, and that even the most basic game struggles, but I can live with that.Before buying the Vaio P, ask your self what you plan on doing with it, if your only using the Microsoft Office Suit, e-mail, browser, etc... the Vaio P will be great, if you plan on playing games, perhaps the Vaio Z will appeal to you.  If you'll miss having a built in disk drive, perhaps you'll prefer the Vaio TT which still weighs under 3lbs.  I will recommend one thing, if you're looking to save money, and can only have one portable computer, or even one computer (meaning not both a desktop and laptop), do not go out and buy a Vaio P, buy it only as a second computer, only as an Ultra Mobile.I've always believed that laptops should be ultra mobile, and not as heavy and as ugly as Alienware laptops or other hideous 17\" machines (ok, I'll exclude the 17\" MacBook Pro from the hideous list), which is why I love my Vaio P and MacBook Air  ...to me, they are nearly perfect, although I do wish they both had nVidia graphics (the MacBook AIr does), and a 2.)GHz or more CPU.  I have owned other NetBooks and Ultra Mobiles, and so far the Vaio P is my favorite.  I've had two Sony Vaio U-series, the Samsung Q1, the Acer Aspire One, the Lenovo S10, and maybe one or two others I really hated and can't remember.  ...the Lenovo S10 and Acer Aspire One will run a lot better than the Vaio P (enough for you to tell a difference) and do cost a lot less, and performance wise I would recommend them anytime over the Vaio P, but they were just to big for me (not to mention the Acer Aspire One is one ugly piece of machine, the new Aspire One looks a bit nicer though).Let's just say that if you want portable, a really high resolution monitor, a really bright monitor, a nice keyboard size, good US/Canada based customer service (with a Mac or a Vaio you'll likely never have to call anyways), a great innovative design, only carry 1.5lbs, read both SD and Memory Stick media, the Vaio P is right for you....so anyways, that's more of my opinion on the Vaio P and portable computers, I didn't want to bother writing a review since many websites have already rated the Vaio P, and many self-proclaimed experts have written their review on Amazon.As a side note, if you really like your Vaio P, you might want to consider getting a Vaja Case, an extended battery for traveling, perhaps an extra charger for the office, and I would recommend upgrading to Windows 7 as soon as it becomes available for better performance (or downgrading the XP, which I'm not doing).As for others reviewing the Vaio P, understand what this machine is meant to do, and what it's for, prior to giving it 3 or less stars with any justification other than  complaining about how it costs to much.-I just wanted to post an update.  The new Vaio P laptops are out, and they come with 1.6 and 1.8GHz processors.  For those interested in a more affordable computer, which Sony is also labeling as a \"mini laptop\", the Vaio W comes out August 2009.  The W series won't be as small as the P series though.", "Date": "May 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Tiny, feather-light and beautiful", "Author": "John Davis \"johnkdavis\"", "ReviewID": "RB4Z7G0KORUCL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am an early adopter and gadget freak. I took a long time researching options before deciding on the Sony VAIO VGN-P530H/W Lifestyle PC (1.33 GHz Intel Processor, 2 GB RAM, 60 GB Hard Drive with G-Sensor, Vista Basic) White. I could not be more happy with the purchase.My ExpectationsDo not expect a gaming PC if you purchase the Lifestyle PC. It is slow. The text is very small. Vista sucks, but it really sucks on an ATOM CPU. So, there are compromises.What you can expect is an amazingly minute PC. It weighs next to nothing. And, its beauty is unparalleled.My ExperienceWhen unpacking the Lifestyle PC and getting it up and running I was disappointed that the Quick Start Guide had a \"misprint.\" The guide instructs the purchaser to check supplied items and lists them. \"Noise canceling headphones (*on selected models only)\" is on the list, but not in the package.I called Sony about this. They told me it was a misprint. I suspect the Sony rep was not well informed and the truth is that the lowest priced Lifestyle PC is not a selected model. In any event, do not expect to find this item in the package.Getting things ready takes awhile, but it is an easy process. The time is a normal Vista install thing.I had to increase the size of the text a bit (60 year-old eyes), but the screen is surprisingly bright and the tiny text is surprisingly clean and clear enough to read without a magnifying glass. For me, the benefits of the 1600 x 768 resolution far outweigh any minor inconvenience caused by having to read minuscule text.My SolutionsSpeed: The only serious problem I have with the speed of the Lifestyle PC is the time it takes to start up. So, I leave the unit in Sleep mode whenever I store it away in my waist pack. This is accomplished easily by simply closing the clam shell. When you open the PC again Vista pops up instantly.If you leave the computer closed long enough (the time period is user-configurable) it will Hibernate to save battery power. It takes Vista too long to reload the desktop when coming out of Hibernate, so this option is not a good solution.I have tested it and leaving the PC in Sleep mode for 12 hours consumes about 20% of the standard capacity battery, 10% of the large capacity battery. This is an acceptable use of power resources for the convenience of \"instant on\" functionality, for me.The alternate Instant Mode (Linux) is an awesome feature of the Lifestyle PC. It is not only fast, it provides about 90% of what I need from a PC. Most of my computing is now done in the cloud. My need for installed software in Vista is minimal.One caveat here: The installed Firefox browser provided in Instant Mode is a dumbed-down version of Firefox. I have not yet researched hacks to resolve this issue. I will because I must be able to run Firefox plug-ins that I rely on and I suspect there is a not-too-difficult way around the Sony-Microsoft imposed limitations on Firefox available from Instant Mode. I'll post information about this matter when I have it figured out.Finally, the wireless features of the Lifestyle PC are wonderful. The process of using WiFi and Bluetooth are so smooth and simple that anyone should have no trouble using these wireless tools.3G is another irritant. This time it is Sony-Verizon imposing limitations on functionality. The Lifestyle PC has all of the hardware needed to setup the built-in WWAN with just about any provider, but it too has been dumbed-down.I will not support Verizon. They are being pulled kicking and screaming to give users access to free and powerful tools. Instead, they have expensive proprietary tools they want to force on users. Sony is assisting them. A pox on both of their houses.I use an awesome T-Mobile G1 mobile phone. Fortunately, it is open-source (Android) and there is a plethora of software out there that allow the phone to perform miracles. I can easily tether the G1 to the Lifestyle PC and have easy, no additional cost, no problem broadband Internet access by connecting the G1 to the Lifestyle PC using a USB cable.Wow! This setup really works. I notice only a slight speed reduction between using the Internet at home via WiFi on my cable provided service and 802.11n router and using the Internet when I'm out-and-about by connecting via a tethered 3G setup on my G1.If you have appropriate expectations, you will fall in love with a Lifestyle PC.", "Date": "May 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Vista is ruining this amazing laptop", "Author": "Abdulrahman Luai Alterkait \"Abdulrahman Al-Te...", "ReviewID": "R1RD1HYJGX4VR8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really enjoyed using this laptop, but I feel Vista is too heavy for it.

With this \"new\" entry into the ultra portable market, Sony is trying to rejuvenate a very mobile product.I wanted to love this laptop (Sony doesn't want you to call it a netbook - probably so you don't feel bad about the cost - a $900 netbook is steep). I always wanted a picturebook. Something that you could easily carry around for basic stuff. Bring on a plane and watch a few HD videos. Surf the internet, email, etc. It really seemed to be the perfect device. Plus the built in GPS was something that I was very excited about. So much so that I was willing to overlook the $900 price tag. On paper, this seemed to be a very nice and capable computer in a very small - and beautifully designed package.But when I got it, I saw some of the flaws... serious flaws. There are basically three major flaws. The first is Vista. It just wants to much power for this little computer to really shine. A device like this needs a very lean operating system. The only thing that is lean about Vista on the Sony P, is that you have to shut off all of the eye candy so it will be usable. This was strike one.I tried running XP and Windows 7, and while they both ran significantly better, there was still another flaw - the Video card. Unfortunitly, it seems to either be a driver issue or a less then adequate video chipset. What ever it is, know this - this laptop does not play video very well at all. In fact you have to jump through a few hoops just to get it to play videos without them stuttering. It is really sad. In my opinion, someone, or some department should have gotten fired for this.It never should have been realased unitl playing video worked flawlessly (both regular and HD). This should have been a no brainer for Sony - the media giant.  I mean the display on this laptop is begging to be a portable video player. Strike two.The finally, the bloated applications that come preinstalled. A HUGE flaw. There is an application (smartwi) that manages the wireless network card, bluetooth, GPS and the mobile broadband connection. This is the one of the biggest drains on the laptop's resources. There are so many required apps, that even if you do a clean install of XP or Win7 - you have to install a whole bunch of Sony bloat, many of which only run in Vista. Really, between Vista and the Sony bloatware, this should be nimble little computer is brought to its knees in tears. Strike threePersonally I never had a really great experience running XP, Vista or 7 on this... and I tried. Boy did I try. I spent many hours trying and reading forums and trying again. As I said earlier, I WANTED to love this laptop - I WANTED to get it to work. But in the end there were so many big and little things that just didn't work that I sent it back.It really is a shame. If Sony can get their act together, this would be a great portable device. Unfortunately, based on how I have perceived Sony to do business, they won't. What they will do is release a new model of this device every 3-4 month and each one will be very minor changes for the same amount (if not more)  money. Meanwhile, someone else (like Fujitsu or Apple) will come in behind Sony and do it right.For now, I am going to save my $900 until I can find one that has all the kinks worked out.", "Date": "April 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "The Little Sony That almost Could...", "Author": "Mox \"Sunshiner\"", "ReviewID": "R1VI2O937LU5C9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have now owned this little traveler for a week and have seen its worth and its warts. First, and vital to me as a frequent flyer, I adore the size of the Vaio P series. It is so easily carried in a brief case - along with its small power brick. The weight is amazing - so light that it almost makes you wonder what's really in it! So in the travel department the Sony VGN-P530H is a hands down winner.The screen resoultion is fantastic! I never use the zoom since I can easily read the fine resolution print. And in programs like Microsoft Word they all have their own zoom factors so it is not a problem to me. I do a lot of touch typing in the Word format and the keyboard works very well for me - but I do have small hands.The battery life? Well there's the rub. The standard battery in normal usage last me an hour to an hour and a half. I have ordered the extended battery (and a case) from Sony Style.The speed? True the loading is a bit long but once up and running I find the system, while not perky, at least adequate. A bit of tweaking with startup settings and it did improve.

After a while of using the Vaio, all other notebook screens look so coarse.Portability, excellent keyboard, and excellent screen is the main reason I like this unit.Cons: The Intel Atom Z520 1.33Ghz is slightly underpowered. I have a Acer Aspire One as well running an 1.6GHz Atom, and the 0.33GHz difference is there, even though the Acer has 1GB of memory, and the VaioP has 2GB, the extra memory helps a little, but not much. The Aspire One is definitely speedier.Battery life is ok, since you can get 2 1/2 hours under normal use. The recharge time seems kinda long, but it's ok for me, since it's better to have a battery charge slower vs. faster, so it wears out less.I got the VGN-P530H which is the 60GB PATA HDD model. I played with the 64GB SSD and 128GB SSD models in the store, and frankly I felt as if the SSD models were slower, mostly because SSDs are slower because of write operations. Windows is a OS that swaps to disk a lot when memory is low, so having an SSD is not that beneficial.

But this was my first try with \"netbook.\" This products has a great features, style, and size and that's one of the reason I bought this netbook.  There are some pros and cons about this and I'll let you know to help you on purchasing this item.pros:1. The Size: size of this product is just amazing. There are few other netbooks came out but this is the smallest. Very handy and portable. I mean who's gonna beat the size of 9.65\" x 4.72\" x 0.78\" and the weight of 1lb 4.8oz?  The only thing is, it's not going to fit on your hip pocket, like it advertised. But It will fit on your hand just fine, or for girls, it will fit on your small purse.2. The resolution:  Most of the netbooks came out with the screen resolution of 1028 x 680, but Sony made this 1600 x 768, which provides more comfortable views for users. Although, the 8 inch screen is kindda too small for that resolution, you might feel tired after looking at the screen for long time.3. The instant booting system:  The instant booting system (based on Linux system) takes about 15 seconds to boot up, you can browse websites, watch movies or listen to musics.  You can also boot up the computer to windows mode from there.  This comes very handy.Cons:1. Sony just had to make it with the Vista.  The performance goes dramatically down running Vista on this product.  You can also downgrade it to XP, which makes VAIO P much faster to perform, but you will find lags watching movies because there's no GMA 500 chip set driver for XP. The best way to use VAIO P is to upgrade its operating system to Windows 7, overall performance was very nice. Although, it might be slower than XP, you can use GMA 500 driver and overall performance is good.2. VAIO P is using 1.33GHz Z520 Intel Atom Processor.  This chip set makes VAIO P not able to perform as fast as other laptops, but for netbooks, it is pretty fast.3. The price of this is about $1,000 when most of netbook's price is around $500. I don't think VAIO P performs twice as much as other netbooks, but the design of it is more than twice as much as other products.4. HD (Hard Disk) performance is much lower than SSD (Solid State Disk) performance. I think it'd be much better to choose SSD model if you want to buy this. Bad about it is the capacity.

The battery life is simply not good enough to make the product useful to me.Booting the machine is painfully slow. It takes something like 5 minutes for a complete boot. If you want to tinker with registry and stuff maybe this could be reduced a bit.What I want is a PC that acts like a cell phone: you open the cover and it is ready to go. 5 minute boot is not acceptable in that scenario.You can avoid the boot by making the system sleep/hibernate when you close the lid. It takes less that a minute for it to wake up, and I could live with this, except the system consume significant energy when it is asleep. If I close the lid (and put the machine to sleep) on a full battery, it will not make it through the day asleep. If you use it for a half hour, you have reduced the sleep time quite a bit (a couple of hours).I am sure Sony has a list of tips for extending battery life, but I don't want to become a laptop energy expert.My guess is that people who give powerpoint presentations would love this, also people who fly a lot. It would be great for them because it is so small and light and the battery life wouldn't matter because in both these situations you could plug it in.I'm curious if replacing the hard drive with a flash drive would help. Also, maybe a faster hard drive would make the boot quicker. Windows 7 might help. Maybe running Linux would help the boot time too.I've toyed with getting the extended battery, but the thought of spending another $100 after the original $999 is not very attractive.

On the other hand, it is too small to serve as my primary laptop.  I bought an Asus eeePC when it first came out.  The keyboard is narrower than the Sony, and I could never get used to it.  While it is very small, the Sony is much shorter and thinner and easier to carry, and the AC adapter is tiny.  Like other Sony laptops, and unlike most Windows laptops, the screen is very bright.  The smallness of the fonts is not a problem in browsing and most programs because the font size can be adjusted easily enough without any major tradeoff.  Other programs, like Outlook, and working within Windows are much more eye challenging.

I have asked for a refund as I do not want to deal with Sony's poor customer service in the future.Think long and hard about buying a Sony PC...  In this day where you can get a computer basically at your local 7-11, customer service matters as much as the quality of the hardware.

I have been a SONY fan for ages, but this time they let me down to the extent that I'll never buy Sony again. I bought a Sony Vaio VGN FZ series and after 15 months the motherboard completely broke. It just shut off with no warning and I tried to get help from Sony but they have the worst techinical support in the USA; the only thing they do (after waiting several minutes on the phone for someone to take your call) is say \"I am sorry for your inconvenience\" or \"send your laptop to the Service Center\". I live in Virginia and their proposal was me to send the laptop to San Diego, CA!!!!! and I would have to run with all costs (including shipping) plus they told tha it would be more than 500 dollars to repair a laptop that costs 980 dollars brand new!!!!  I just gave up and wiil be definitely getting a new one; however, this time I am going to go for a Dell or HP because now I realize the importance of a good technical support.", "Date": "June 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Bittersweet machine", "Author": "Sarah", "ReviewID": "R1QNONEKJBICUL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I actually got my Sony Vaio N-series from Best Buy. However, I felt complied to write about my experience with my machine.Wanting a inexpensive laptop for college, I got a Sony Vaio N-Series. At first I thought, \"this thing rocks!\" A large screen, nice roomy keyboard. By the end of the semester my thoughts changed dramatically.First thing that charged my opinion on Sony: I accidentally dropped a small aerosol can of hair mousse on my lappy. The force was so great that the hard drive \"popped out\" of place. The campus technology director said that cannot be the case...usually laptop hard drives are protected to vast degrees. A small, light weight can should not have dislodged the hard drive. Long story short the hard drive had to be replaced via the dislodged--all from a 7oz can of hair mousse. Apparently Sony can really protect them hard drives!Second thing: The battery life. On one charge the battery lasts about 45 minutes. That's with the screen dimmed.Lastly: The plug-in wall charger. It's been three years since I took my laptop out of the box. For about two years the charger worked great...fully energized the laptop etc. Until this year. One day, while doing my daily web page viewing, the charger \"blew-up\" and refused. I had to purchase an after-market replacement. Just my luck, so I thought. However, a few days ago my mom's (more expensive) Sony Vaio charger blew-up as well. So it is not just me.Do not get me wrong. Sony has created some awesome products and other laptops.

Heres my problem with this, I spent all this money on a laptop, only to realize that it didn't come with a latch! even after the salesperson sold it to me telling me it had a way \"some how\" to latch, and then after the first year of owning it, keep in mind my screen is now scratched... the hinges have come loose! - so stuff gets in the computer even more now... This computer would be great, if sony didn't have such a crappy warranty policy about replacing a damaged product, clearly caused by an idiot engineer that DIDN'T want to put a latch on my laptop!
