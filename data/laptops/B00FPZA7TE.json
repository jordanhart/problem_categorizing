The lap top I received was re-furbished and crashed within the first week.  The company did send a full refund which was a huge plus.  I did like the size and the fact it had 10 key.  It is likely a good product.  I would be leery of buying a re-furbished computer though.", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Asus VivoBook S500CA-RSI5T02 - Windows 8 64-bit\nIntel Dual-Core i5-3317U 1.70GHz with Turbo Boost Technology up to 2.60GHz - 8GB RAM - 500GB (5400rpm) HDD + 24GB SSD\n15.6\" (1366x768) Touchscreen LED Backlight - Intel HD Graphics 4000 - 802.11 b/g/n - 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet\nWebcam - Built-in Speakers -  Built-in Microphone\n(1) USB 3.0 - (2) USB 2.0 - (1) HDMI - (1) VGA - (1) Headphone/Microphone Combo Jack - SD Card Reader - Lithium-polymer Battery", "Name": "Asus VivoBook S500CA Intel Core i5-3317U 1.70GHz 8GB RAM 500GB HDD + 24GB SSD Webcam Windows 8 64-bit 15.6-inch TOUCHSCREEN", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41xnvgUnmxL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00FPZA7TE"}}
