Was not happy with the computer.  The sound mainly came from the subwoofer and not the actual speakers and the subwoofer is not centrally located on the computer so it made for a very awful audio experience. This was a problem that you could only find out about after opening the box and testing the product thus making it ineligible for return. According to the return policy of Adorama, the company apparently selling this product, they don't accept any opened products without only giving a maximum 50% refund. Now I'm down $700 and VERY unhappy. When I contacted Amazon, they backed up the seller 100%. I will never buy from this company again and frankly, I will be less likely to use Amazon for buying things as well.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Large screen, built like a drag racing tank.", "Author": "Plowdoggy", "ReviewID": "R3K0U2SAN8SKPV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Think of this as a portable desktop unit rather than an light on the fly laptop.

I only use it for games like WoW, Starcraft 2, Star Wars the Old Republic. The performance on these is wonderful, even on high quality settings (not quite up to snuff on ultra), but there's just a few complaints. I know mousepads aren't wonderful for gaming, but this laptop's mousepad just seems to stick often and you have to drag multiple times to get it to move. Not that big a deal though, I can just use an external mouse. The other complaint is I've already had quite a few occasions where my games just quit unexpectedly, sometimes with the computer restarting afterwards.But everything other than these few problems is wonderful. Design is beautiful, lights on the keyboard is a nice touch. On the rather hefty side, which isn't much of a problem for me, I don't move my laptop around much. Cooling system seems to work very well. And as said earlier, performance is great. Overall, I'd recommend this laptop, but it would be a STRONG recommendation if it wasn't for the unexpected exits/restarts. Not very conductive to raiding or other MMO scenarios where you just can't have your computer randomly restarting.UPDATE:It's been a few more weeks with this laptop. I'm still extremely happy with the performance of the machine. The random restarts haven't happened since I wrote my original review. Mousepad still stinks but like I said, no big deal; I know that's one flaw of laptops.But to update my recommendation: 100% all in on this laptop. I would pick it again if I had the option and pay the same price.", "Date": "April 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Robert W McGuffin III", "ReviewID": "R1SFZGO4ZHQHNT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Super awesome cool computer.

I read the great reviews about this laptop here on Amazon, and had high expectations.It's now been 3 weeks sine I received this, and honestly I am hard-pressed to imagine how anyone could refer to this laptop as \"fast.\" While it looks good, and it feels quality, the performance is another matter entirely.Problems:- Terrible at holding an internet connectionWhen closing and reopening I constantly have to \"re-find\" my connection. No, it has nothing to do with signal strength, as my 4 year old Toshiba has never had a problem with this. In fact, I have them both in the same room, and my Toshiba will locate twice as many available connections as the Asus. Not only that, the Toshiba is ready to use the second I open it. The Asus I have to wait 45 - 60 seconds for it to re-establish a connection. Might not sound like much, but it grows tiresome very quickly, to the point I've begun to hate using this.- Internet BrowsingI figured with the i7 and 12 gb of memory that multi-tasking with this laptop wouldn't be a problem. Wrong.  It is not uncommon for me to have 15 - 25 tabs open as I multi-task quite often. With my Toshiba, I often have as many as 35 - 40 tabs, and it never broke a sweat. With the Asus, I am forced to contantly monitor how many tabs I have open as the entire screen begins to freeze, and the 'processing/working\" icon pops up and makes me wait 15 -20 seconds while it attempt to do something as simple as register that I just clicked on a link. In fact, even while writing this review, I've had to stop 4 times already as my words will not appear on the screen for 20 - 30 seconds as the Asus struggles to keep up since I have 10 tabs open.Honestly, I can recall using my old HP back in 2007 that had no problem keeping up with 15 - 20 tabs being open simultaneously. It disturbs me that in 2013 this mid-level laptop struggles. My productivity is being impacted, and I am certain I will end up returning this due to the extremely poor performance. There are other complaints as well, but the above should be enough to make anyone think twice about purchasing.It's a shame really because I really do like the looks of this laptop. It looks and feels great, and he monitor is as crisp and bright as I could hope for. But the wretched performance kills any desire I have to hold onto this machine. Looks like Toshiba will be getting a repeat customer from me. I just put the two machines side by side, and the 4 year old Toshiba obliterates the Asus in every aspect. (The sad part is the Asus has nothing on it - Whereas the Toshiba has over 400 gigs of content on the Hard-drive, and about 2 dozen major software programs running - Yet it is still quicker than the new, out of the box Asus.)I will contact support first in the hopes that there could be a solution and report back if performance improves", "Date": "April 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "critics can shut their faces", "Author": "new2this", "ReviewID": "R2ER39J47OWLK9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "so this was my first true gaming for myself after a long time of my friends having ones.

I've also had many problems including freezes every so often that last around a minute but happen frequently so it's annoying. Also the charger port is a very bad design and they have a better way version of chargers out there.

I configured it personally. I want to thank everone in advance for their posts and reviews because they were very informative and influential in my decision on what to get and what to avoid.1) Upgraded CPU for added performance, plan to keep laptop 2-3 years.2) Upgraded NIC to Intel 6235 because there are so many complaints about Atheros range.3) Wanted couple SSDs but they're a bit pricey, needed storage space and I'll upgrade later.4) Wanted 3D version but it's matted & cannot be configured with significantly brighter screen.5) Wanted GTX670, was told I wouldn't notice difference if not gamer. Kepler is newer technology.6) Wanted 32GB since I'll be using VMWare to run many OSs & Graphic Rendering. Plan to keep 2-3 years.If none of the items I mentioned above are needed or the configuration below is overkill then go with the base model ASUS G75VW-AS71 for $1,499.99, it's less than half of what I configured and Amazon is one the best, if not the best online retailers ( excellent prices, customer services & reviews )...I really wrestled with getting the base model now for ~1500 and get another one a year later when newer technology comes out.

They said mouse is not covered under warranty. Ok, so I said forget it.On 3rd December the BD-ROM drive stopped working. I called support.I was shocked to learn that no service personnel would be sent to my house, and I would have to visit an 'authorised' service center. They provided me with service center numbers. I called them. No one answered on the nearest one for 2 days and another service center put me on hold for 20 mins and then hung up.So I said, forget it. I don't use my BD-ROM anyway.Then a few days later the sound would jitter while playing videos, which again support didn't really help me with. I looked online and upgraded my Nvidia graphics drivers and somehow that fixed the sound. Weird.Then the random freezes and shutdowns started. I cannot count the number of times the computer would just go to the BSOD (blue screen of death) and shutdown. On restart sometimes it would again freeze on the login screen, and I would have to restart it multiple times hoping it will switch on properly on next reboot.Around the same time, the battery life went bust. It would hardly run for 15 mins on battery and just die.But this wasn't that much of a problem because I use a MacBook Air when I go for meetings etc. This just stays at home, and so is constantly plugged in.Finally around a little over a year into the computer's life, I decided to backup my data and reset my computer by reinstalling windows, which wasn't exactly a smooth process either. I had no help and had to constantly refer to online tutorials and figure out what to do to even begin the reinstall process. After this, the computer functioned smoothly for around 8 months. What great 8 months those were.But a couple of days back, in the middle of some work, my computer just turned off. Slowly, as if it were dying. No BSOD, no freeze, just died. I haven't been able to switch it on since then. I have called support 3 times, each time my details were taken and before anything else, the line would be hung up. I am now tired of waiting for 10 mins before someone answers and another 5 to provide my details and then being hung up on.The product worked really well when it did for those 8 months. The performance is mind blowing. The power to play games and run multiple graphics intensive applications at the same time is fantastic. But it got in my way so much and so many parts didn't function correctly that I can only remember the bad times.I am considering donating it to a geek friend of mine for salvage. Maybe he can use it as some form of computer crash test dummy.", "Date": "September 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Zero Stars - do your research", "Author": "John Kouhsari", "ReviewID": "R38JGIBEZVY5WA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop in Feb of 2011 for $2300 and the touchpad has not worked properly since then.
