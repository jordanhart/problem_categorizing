I had first ordered from Costco a Toshiba that had every bell and whistle and was lightning quick.  It should have a been a dream.  However, it was made nearly unusable by Windows 8 and I wisely decided to return it.  I went on the hunt for a Windows 7 laptop and found this one.  I was a bit skeptical about how the description mentions Windows 8, but while reading other reviews I gained confidence in placing the order and am so happy I did.The computer arrived quickly and is everything I hoped it would be.  I am no super techie but this laptop is fast.  Applications open quickly and surfing the net is lightning fast over wireless.Some things I really love about this computer are:1) It is not loaded down with Bloat-ware2) I also love having the buttons above the mousepad3) It also has an HDMI outlet in case you want to hook it to a TV or something4) It comes with Windows 7 pre-installed but they send you Windows 8 recovery disc5) The screen is gorgeous and looks like it is anti-glare6) The speakers sound nice to me7) It has a web cam8) It has a DVD reader/writer (not blue ray but I don't care)Quite frankly I wish I had the funds available to buy an additional one.  It seems like everyone in the house needs use of a computer at the same time and having one more would solve some problems.  Overall, both myself and my husband are very happy with this purchase.  Like he said \"Wow, this is smoking fast!\"  If you are looking for a quick little workhorse then you really can't go wrong.  Plus having Windows 7 will make you way happier than that mess that they call Windows 8.", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great, fast, thinkpad...", "Author": "Sebatian Lapitz", "ReviewID": "R9UKB1EN9DJ37", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this laptop for my mother and it\u2019s perfect.

My son helped me choose this one due to its price (I did not not want to spend a lot) and what it offered (size/weight/resolution/battery life, etc).  My 'soft' review follows.Pros:1.  Light and comfortable on my lap since it does not get uncomfortably warm.2.  Keys are solid and respond well.3.  Mouse pad works perfectly and very responsive.4.  Speakers are positioned on the front facing the user and have great sound.5.  TrackPoint takes getting used to and I am not sure if I will use it.6.  Has Windows 7.7.  Programs load fast.8.  When closed the top has a dull matted finish that looks great.9.  Free shipping.Cons:None so far.  I have had this for approximately one month and I am very satisfied.  I would purchase again.

Last week it went dead and would not power up. Nothing, no charging lights or any other sign of life. Went through the trouble shooting procedure and finally ended up on Lenovo's web forum. Wow! Story after story of the same failure traced to a bad EEPROM on the motherboard. Story after story of how Lenovo walked away from this issue and left everyone hanging if their machine was out of warranty. This is what is known in the industry as a \"catastrophic failure\". Despite the lack of satisfaction reported by the posts of the web site, I called anyway. First, they would not acknowledge there was a problem. The tech sidestepped the issue completely. Second, they wouldn't do a thing w/o a $500.00 deposit which is about what I paid for the product to start with. These failures are the fault of the component provider but it is Lenovo's responsibility to make it good. Their tech support and customer service is as bad as it gets. This month's Consumer Reports pretty much confirms it. So, if your considering a Lenovo product, make sure you are prepared to treat it as a \"Throw Away\" if it breaks. I am moving to Apple. They cost a good bit more but Apple stands behind their products and Apple also has the lowest repair frequency of any other computer manufacturer. I am tired of spending my good money and then be treated like a chump.", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Windows 7 Yay!", "Author": "Monica Senius", "ReviewID": "R1LHVE275ZWZFX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am so glad to have found a Win 7 laptop.

Rating is based on the laptop itself and Lenovo technical support. The first one I received was faulty--the WiFi did not work.  Took it to the tech people at work who confirmed the WiFi was faulty.  To be sure, they got it online using a dongle and updated all drivers and other software--there was a lot to update.  Then contacted Lenovo support.  The first tech I talked with attributed the problem to something that was not even remotely plausible.  He was an idiot.  The second one I talked with was rude and just kept saying the only choice I had was to send it back to Lenovo.  Contacted the seller who had me return it to them, but let me order another one first so I would not be without a computer.  I was using the first one with the dongle from work.  the reorder was smooth and I got the replacement machine in a timely basis. However it was faulty also.  The WiFi worked as it was supposed to, but the screen would suddenly go dark after a few uses--totally black when plugged in, almost too dark to read when not plugged in.  Contacted Lenovo again.  This person took me through several software updates, after which it seemed to work.  However, I soon discovered it was only because I rebooted.  Now must reboot every few times I use it when the screen goes black.  Will contact Lenovo again once I have another computer to use as I know I will have to return to them.  I would not buy another Lenovo product because of poor quality and terrible tech support.  I was going to get a Lenovo Yoga Pro as my carry-around, but now will not.  Will get Surface Pro or ASUS Trio instead.  Buying this laptop was a poor choice.  I have owned several Toshiba laptops and never ran into quality issues or unknowledgeable and rude tech support people.

It would have been the same price, if not more expensive, to get an Apple with nothing pre-installed.  I also have an Adobe Creative Suite on this computer and everything is still running well, even though the software takes up a lot of space.  My only complaint is the keyboard is set back about 4-5 inches and it strains my wrists to move the mouse (I am always on my smartphone, and have developed thumb, wrist and forearm problems).  I had to get a wireless mouse because it literally hurts me to use the red dot or the mouse that come on the computer.  Definitely get a wireless mouse with this computer!!
