I powered them up and personalized them.  One thing I noticed right away is that when you plug in a mouse, the smart pad is automatically disabled.  I love that!  My own Asis laptop does not, so when you type you can accidently cause unintended commands to happen.The screen is bright and large.  It has a full numeric keypad.  Bloatware is minimal.  The wireless connects instantly and pulls in a strong signal.  It has an attractive outer surface which makes it look like a high end unit.On the negative side, like many new notebooks, the cover does not latch when closed, but the hinge is very tight and it stays closed.Battery life and reliability will need to wait to be tested till after the holidays.Update:  A person asked about the speakers.  They are typical of laptop speakers in that they are not very good for music or movies but acceptable for speech.  But is there a laptop of this size that is good for music or movies?", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Lemon", "Author": "Yifrah Kaminer", "ReviewID": "R3AF8PXMRKTEE1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Had it for only 3 weeks and it has already crushed.seems to have hard drive issues.Be happy to return it.", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Happy", "Author": "Neka", "ReviewID": "R135HODTZ4M6IX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this laptop as a gift and the Recepient of the gift has been so so happy with it.

The keyboard does show every finger print and looks really greasy after its been used for a bit but that is easy enough to wipe down. The laptop is big but is relatively lightweight. The shell has a nice textured look but feels smooth so it doesn't show fingerprints all over which is nice. There is a number pad to the right of the keyboard which I really like, especially for games like WoW. Overall I would say it is quick, however booting up and shutting down can take a while but it runs WoW nicely. The battery life is not that bad. If I am using it unplugged I get about 3-5 hours depending on what I am doing. I love Win 7, I think it is soooooooooo much better than Vista like my old Toshiba had. It comes with minimal bloatware and even already had Google Chrome installed, which is great because I am a big google user. I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone who needs a laptop for daily use or school and even some light gaming.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Just a wonderful laptop. Thank you Toshiba.", "Author": "Sherwin Lee Hornick", "ReviewID": "R1WLZLKTXE6OGB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this Toshiba 15.6 inch laptop last week for business travel. I am just loving it. Great quality and style. All my family members have Toshiba laptops. My wife has the 17 inch version that we bought last year from Amazon. We still use the 5 year old Toshiba 14 inch with Windows XP laptop in our guest room. Over the years I have had a variety of different brands. We stay with Toshiba because the internal components just last. Never a problem.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "DON'T BUY TOSHIBA", "Author": "Td Bank Gift Card \"Daniel Stubbs\"", "ReviewID": "R2SIAJ4SXCWZT2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'm deeply disgusted with Toshiba, With there product and there customer service. First day I have had this computer, I have had nothing but problems. Extremely slow and freezes all the time until the hard drive gave out. Toshiba paid for shipping to send it back to them to fix it. Did that and waited weeks without a computer. Came back with nothing but problems, even worse. After having it for a few days, it completely quit.It won't even turn on. To let you know I did upgrade the ram to 8 gigs. So anyway I called and the claims department was'int open, 8am to 5pm. It shows Toshiba does'int care about there customers. Finally I got to talk to them the next day after they waited to call me later in the day. I express to them I use it for work and they did'int care about that. I ask them for a refund, they told me no and told me to bring it back to the store. After owning this laptop for a few months they should of known that is impossible. I ask for express shipping, they told me that can't happen. The attitude I got from them was unnecessary. Even if I was upset. Being upset with them should have been expected considering the circumstances. Customer is all ways right. Three days without my computer, three days without there box there sending me to ship the computer. Don't make the same mistake I did, DON'T BUY TOSHIBA.", "Date": "December 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "I have a similar model L755-S5245", "Author": "makeminelatte", "ReviewID": "RIX7SMMD9G1R9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Whatever you do DO NOT UPDATE THE BIOS! Toshiba products have a high rate of failure after attempting a BIOS UPDATE. I have to replace my bios chip, possibly the motherboard and have to pay the guy for labor. The bios chips are about $10-15.00, the motherboards are about $ 200.00 and the labor is 75.00 an hour. It is not worth that much. For that price I can get several other used laptops with better options. If you don't believe me then do your research and also research how to fix the bios when the screen does not come back on after the failed update. If you want to update your bios take it to a professional before doing it yourself.", "Date": "September 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Be careful", "Author": "Amanda", "ReviewID": "R1JDAOOII8U5YW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "whatever you do keep your virus software updated!! i didnt now my laptop has become victim to death..replacing the parts and software is going to cost more than the laptop is worth. other than that i love it! i miss it! im saving up for a new laptop", "Date": "April 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "sound is not good!", "Author": "lima", "ReviewID": "R8EQYLRFOBEKH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have owned computers for aprox 25 years.  With the purchase of this laptop I was not looking for a high end model.  I just wanted dependability and fairly basic functions. I would have liked this laptop very much,  but the one problem that blew the whole deal for me is the low volume of the internal speakers.I even returned the first model back to the store and still have the same problem with the replacement model.  The internal speakers are way too quiet.  I have tried all the usual common fixes, volumne settings, control panel,  along with uninstalling and reinstalling the sound drivers and updating the same.  The speaker issue is not a small one to me.  I have plugged in four different types of external speakers and headphones and most of which gave some improvement, but the volume was turned up to its max and it still was not completely audible for movies and such.I am very disappointed that Toshiba while making what seems to me a good laptop cannot provide decent speakers. That is a basic!", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005XC9H8G"}}
