If you are not used to a tablet environment, windows 8 is going to be a bit challenging, but nothing to worry about. There is a short manual for windows 8 showing some touchpad commands and once you access the first thing you will see is a dashboard, where there is a tutorial.I got caught up by how beautiful windows 8 looks, and just by switching tabs you access classic windows 7 desktop view, which I personally believe to be useful while you become familiar with this OS.The computer is fast. As soon as I completed the registration process I started to install essential apps for college like dropbox, evernote, chrome... They were set up and ready in no time, meanwhile I updated default apps while enjoying a Walking Dead episode. Gladly the PC performance had no issues with this multitasking.  I did order a 4gb ram which I will install ASAP, since nowadays 6gb is the recommended memory ram, having a total of 8gb for $25 is a great threat.--------------------------------------------------------------------Update 02/27/2013-----------------Just installed 4gb ram ((HP 4 GB DDR3 SDRAM Memory Module - 4 GB - 1333MHz DDR3-1333/PC3-10600 - DDR3 SDRAM SoDIMM)) and I can feel the difference in performance, I had never install a memory in my life and with a little help from youtube I got it right. The PC was doing great and now is awesome. Highly recommended.--------------------------------------------------------------------Update 03/18/2013-----------------It's been almost a month, and since day 1 I am waiting to see performance issues since, let's face it, the price is almost to good to be true. I found the following so far:- Wireless not functioning properly: While other devices in the same room such as two more computers and a x-box 360 are streaming videos, surfing the web or playing online, this PC suddenly stops allowing you to surf, or you see the download speed decreases to zero. I know a common issue where other wireless devices interfere with each other's signal but I can not confirm this is the root cause. So anyway, a few times I haven't being able to surf at all for a short period of time.- Touch pad does not respond: I still haven't figured if I am using a keyboard shortcut to disable the touchpad but, I am changing between tabs and different program windows and suddenly the pointer doesn't move while I am on windows 8 dashboard (software issue perhaps?), but the clicking keeps working. I fix it by pressing the windows key twice.This one is a software glitch, so you can expect it and be aware it has not being fixed on windows 8.- Shortcuts can't be deleted: It only happened to me once, yet I read in forums user having the same issue where, once you deleted a program using the Control Panel, or just deleting  a shortcut from your desktop which you no longer require, when trying to delete the shortcut it would not let you. I restarted my computer and the shortcut was no longer there. Just know that your computer is not the problem.Here you can find information about the broken link:[...]That's what I have found so far. I have already stored around 200gb in software, movies, music, regular PC games, etc. And the PC still takes less than 1 minute to start, which is awesome.--------------------------------------------------------------------Update 05/20/2013-----------------**WiFi issues**It has fail from time to time. The only trend I have noticed is when there is a certain update, the WiFi fails partially or completely. I have to go Airplane mode and resume to fixed it. Really lame when streaming.Update and restart solves the problem as well but... Is just not right...Since this is the only problem I have encountered and is not often I am giving 4 stars instead of the initial 5.", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great laptop for the price!", "Author": "Ily C.", "ReviewID": "R11EZS9N6ZMVXZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The laptop is not the most thinnest, but not thick.  It is easy to carry.  The Windows 8 takes some getting used to, but I believe that you will encounter that with anything you purchase with Windows 8.  The battery life is as promissed too.  The processor is fast and multi-tasking is great.The only issue with this laptop is the speakers.

When I sought help from HP, the case manager came out right and said it was HP's goal to make money, not accommodate customers. The wireless router was bad, the unit would freeze inexplicably, it jumped from the page I was working on to the start tiles without warning, the  DVD burner didn't work. I could go on and on. Oh yes, they will send it out for repairs, and by Fed Ex. I told her Fed Ex didn't serve my area and she said I could drive the 62 miles to the nearest pickup point if I wanted the unit repaired. No loaner, no replacement. Best part was when I asked the case worker for her supervisor, and she said she didn't have one. Oh, and they won't reinstall the Office I paid for. Hey, when you've got a bad unit, you've got a bad unit. Admit it, replace it and go forward. I can't speak to the value or reliability of most HP laptops, but I will say that you're on your own if you get a bad one. HP service stinks - just don't buy one.

So this laptop is quite an upgrade for me. If you are used to newer laptops already I'm not sure if you will love it as much as I do. Like all other reviews Windows 8 is a unique experience that takes some getting use to but with a little exploring you will. I do like how you can go to the OG desktop view similar to Windows 7. Setup is super easy pretty much turn it on and you are ready to rock and roll. I have always preferred Google search engine but I am already in love with the format of MSN homepage and Bing search. The only problem I've experienced is the mouse arrow freezes on me from time to time. I just wait a few beats and then it moves again but I wonder why this happens?

The problem is there were no parts for my model any more.  So they REPLACED MY LAPTOP!  NO charge!  I could not be happier with HP customer service!I would still photograph all sides of any product I would send in the mail (with a current newspaper to show the date sent) just in case it gets broken outside of your control.THANKS HP!  (To repeat: I did not buy this particular item.)Original review:  BE FOREWARNED:  HP SERVICE / WARRANTY IS NOT RELIABLE!!!The story:  I have an HP laptop which I sent in for warranty checkup (fix some rubber screen bumpers, cleaning, fan noise, etc.)  On the way there or at HP, it got damaged, which they claim was my doing and wanted $128 to fix it!  They were nice saying that was a \u00bd price offer!  But THEY caused the damage to the laptop!?  The reps said, \"Do you have pictures of the laptop?\"  Ha!  So when I refused to pay and it was returned, it would not even turn on!  I had a professional engineer open it and he said it must have been violently dropped as the CPU had come unseated.  Also they cracked the hinge on one side, so I couldn't close the lid w/o snapping the screen off.  I wrote a letter to the head of marketing and his assistant called back.  He offered me a nominal amount to trade up to another new laptop.  I declined as it wasn't a reasonable offer.  So be forewarned:  IF you get an HP product, the repair dept. may break it and the company will NOT fix it.  They will blame you.  IF you do send it in for repair, take a dozen photos from every angle as you'd have some proof.  I'd take a picture of the box just before you send it as well.  I have had 2 laptops, a camera, and printers from HP.  Never again.  I also sold my shares of HP stock!  BUYER BEWARE!  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE EVER! p.s.  I did not purchase this laptop.", "Date": "October 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "HP pavilion", "Author": "OJIH GREGORYOKWUDILI", "ReviewID": "R21DC3F2ZH4E7D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like Hp products, this one meets my expectations.
