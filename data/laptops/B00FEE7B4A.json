After 5 days I have to say I like it a lot.  I will be upgrading to a 256GB mSata drive myself rather than pay the premium, and from the research I did, I didnt believe going with the i7 was worth the price premium.  Both i5 and i7 are 2 cores, 4 threads, difference being a larger cache on the i7 and higher clockspeed I think.  Based on benchmarks, I decided to skip the upgrade.I orginally ordered from another vendor, but that one had a faulty fan and had to be replaced.  I decided to go with Amazon because their customer service is worth the price premium.Pros1) 3lb is great and easy to carry around to meetings and to my kids baseball games so I can get some work done2) Keyboard is very easy to type on and type on quicky3) Screen is very clear and color is great.  It can be made super bright.  I dont really care about viewing angle as I am in front of it.4) The Intel 4400 graphic card works for a good range of games. It's not the 680M SLI I have in my other laptop, but it can run the new South Park game well, Oblivion, Skyrim, and Fifa 14 (Haven't tried much else).  I wont be gaming heavily on this, but good to know that if I'm on a trip I dont need to take something else.5) Windows 8 is snappier than I expected.6) It is super quiet7) Batter has shown between 8 and 12 hours depending on screen brightnessCons1) I'm not a fan of Windows 8.  I've installed Classic Shell 4.0 and turned off a lot of the weirdness to try to get it behaving like Win 72) Cant seem to get the hang of the touchpad clicker.  The touchpad itself tracks well, but the clicks don't always register and they are loud3) Wireless AC isn't as fast as it should be.  I have an AC router at home (and 100Mbps internet connection) and my other machines download twice as fast4) Gathers fingerprints all over the place, front and back5) I don't really use the touchscreen (except when the touchpad clicker is driving me crazy)", "Date": "March 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "not perfect, but good enough", "Author": "Mario", "ReviewID": "R39GEJBQM0I32H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did my research, wanted to buy thinkpad x1 or t440s, did really place an order of t440s on lenovo, after 2 weeks they informed my by a simple email they order is canceled, I have to call them to get informed that they run out of stock, order is canceled, nothing they can do. So just forget the lenovo, quality could be ok, but can't trust their customer service.Then I locked my target at dell xps 13 (good keyboard, noisy), samsung aktiv book 9 plus (beautiful, but I need more series for business use), Asus Zenbook (bad comments, lot refurbished on sale) and sony vaio pro 13 (bad wifi, lot refurbished on sale).Finally I choose this dell xps 13 (touch screen, win8). Keyboard is really good, touch pad is really bad as most people say and most ultra books are and the gap between touch pad and the machine body is quite big and not even, BAD. Fan could be noisy as most people say and makes you embarrassed in a quiet place. Win8 is so far bad as most people say, even with touch screen. I survive windows vista for 5 years, hopefully I could get used to win8. USB slot is tight for all my cables and USB key, strange. Hard disk is so to say 128GB, what you can use is 103GB only, not a big deal, a big USB key will solve the problem. Last thing (which is not a problem for me) is that the screen opens about 120 degrees only.It's good looking, good finishing, I'm generally satisfied with it.", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,199.99", "Features": "Intel Core i5-4200U Processor (4M Cache, up to 3.0 GHz)\n8 GB DDR3L SDRAM\n128 GB Solid-State Drive\n13.3-Inch Screen", "Name": "Dell Computer XPS 13 XPS13ULT-4286sLV 13.3-Inch Ultrabook", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31DjXtX0Q8L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00FEE7B4A"}}
