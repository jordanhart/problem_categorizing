I have had it for just a few months and the fan is already gone. From the looks of online research, I am in no way the only one with this issue. Luckily, there is a manufacturer's limited warranty for one year on it, but wouldn't you rather have a laptop you don't need to use the warranty for? I had an Asus before I got this one. This was meant to be a temporary replacement, but I got stuck with it. My Asus was great until I dropped it while running. That was my fault, but I never once had any issue with my Asus, and I will never buy this brand PC again.", "Date": "February 12, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Screen Size: 15.6\"\nScreen Resolution: 1366 x 768\nProcessor Type: Intel\nProcessor Model: i5-3317U\nProcessor Speed: 1.7GHz", "Name": "Toshiba 15.6\" Satellite Laptop 6GB 640GB | L955-S5330", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S6BSiYIpL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00B8WOMKI"}}
