I was looking for a budget friendly one and after looking over and over again I found this great laptop.For an entry-level computer, it's pretty decent but has some flaws that some people may found a deal breaker.PROS:-Big Screen-Easy set up-Wide full keyboard-The 6Gb of RAM really can be noticedCONS-Keyboard may be unresponsive at sometimes but, not a deal breaker for me.-Since it uses Windows 8, you need an Outlook.com/Hotmail.com account to log in. You'll be using the same password for your email and for your computer.I personally like the computer a lot for its speed and performance. I find it as an inexpensive option for people looking for a computer for basic tasks like word processing, surfing the web, videochatting, etc.Windows 8 is not as bad once you get used to it. You don't get the red X to close the programs; now, you drag the top of the window to the lower left corner and the program will close. I got used to it after 2-3 hours of using it + watching a tutorial on YouTube.If you are looking for a budget friendly laptop this is the one.", "Date": "March 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "C855-S5134", "Author": "E. White \"~E\"", "ReviewID": "R3HU5SYUU6TTDV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research before purchasing this computer, and I feel I made a good choice. I don't understand why Windows 8 is getting so many bad reviews. It was obviously made for touch screen but can function just as well with a touch pad the same way, just not as cool. For the money this does what I need, pretty much anything. I only paid $350 for this one and seen 2 weeks later it was $50 more, as were the rest of the Toshiba C850 series that Amazon.com had. So I got lucky on buying it when I did. For as much extras as it has, the one thing it's missing is a built in prop so the base isn't flat against the surface causing heat... Also the touchpad is extremely textured and rough feeling, but I never use touchpads anyway I mostly use a wireless mouse. I'm actually building a docking station so I can use my TV as a monitor and wireless mouse / keyboard so I can sit back and be comfortable with a nice display. Even though the standard display on the laptop itself is amazing clear, I have bad eyes and need the words to be much larger when browsing or whatever. This PC is a monster machine. It has like a 3 second boot up time and loads everything instantly. I've been using it for a month now and haven't had a stall or anything. Even with Windows 8, my old programs work too, it has backwards compatibility drivers to run almost any program made for any version of Windows, even XP / Vista. Also works on games, like Sim City 4.I was going to get the new Sim City but I think I'll wait until their servers can handle it lol.Hope my review helps someone.OH PS: BEWARE OF SUPER SAVER SHIPPING!I had a 24\" HDTV in an order a few days after I ordered this laptop, and they ended up shipping them together... They took a huge Amazon.com box, put the TV box in, and the Toshiba box in loose on the TV box. The Toshiba box had damage from sliding around during shipping inside the huge Amazon.com box... The Amazon.com box was literally falling apart... I debated sending the laptop back, but talked to customer service and they told me if it seems damaged during use within 30 days I could exchange or return it, and I'm typing from it now lol, I decided it's a keeper, so it's durable too.", "Date": "March 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "For the price, a great deal", "Author": "ttecaines", "ReviewID": "R19NFKQBWAOGJH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a very solid product for a good price.Just as a warning you will need to install 3rd party apps to make windows 8 usable and figuring out how to make the keyboard use function keys by default was difficult, but other than that it is great.", "Date": "March 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "My 3rd Toshiba Satellite", "Author": "Barbara Laning \"BarbaraL\"", "ReviewID": "R1OV12FP94WYPM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Well since I started buying Satellites a few years back I I have always been happy with them, until now lol.  Honestly this is a decent computer as far as speed and performance.  The graphics are nice, the speed and hard drive size are decent for the price, or they were.  I notice now this laptop has jumped $50 in price since I bought it.The regular cons for the Satellite series are all still there.  Really crappy sound, really crappy webcam, etc which are easy fixes for me.  However, this one has it's other shortcomings as well.  The track pad is WEIRD.  If you have ever seen the textured lap top cases, this track pad  and buttons are made of the same bumpy stuff.  Also, the buttons are not at the bottom of the pad, but about 1/4 in up farther.  Being used to the usual Satellite set-up, I was clicking on the nothing BELOW the buttons for a week until I got used to it.  Then there is the matter of the keyboard.  It feels like one of those $7.99 keyboards I used to buy at walmart in an emergency when my kids had spilled something on the keyboard.  It's very flimsy feeling and it seems at times I have to really hammer on the keys to get it to type.Also, for anyone wondering, the ram is sddr3.  I'm not sure why they just say its DIMM.  Dual inline could be dual inline anything lol.  It's nice to know what you're getting.On the plus side, it's pretty quick, the graphics are nice, and unlike the keyboard, the case itself is solid.Windows 8 is another matter entirely.  It seems you either like it or don't.  I think even on a touch screen it would be just \"ok\".  I personally prefer Android on my tablet.  I absolutely hate windows 8 on a non-touch screen.  The \"corners\" you slide the mouse through to get your options to pop up are not really in the absolute corners, it's more like the size of a post it.  So I accidentally open things I don't want to open.  And God forbid you slide your mouse to the right too fast when you have something else open, like the link to my kids xbox.  Impossible.  You will forever be on the xbox screen and not doing whatever else you were trying to do.  It feels at times you have to go in slow motion, it's like walking on eggshells so you don't make windows 8 mad, lol.  I know there are plenty of outside programs out there to disable these annoying features.  I'm just waiting on the best one.As far as I can tell, this computer still costs less than the other toshiba sat that has less ram, so it is still a good buy if you can get used to this awful trackpad or use a wireless mouse!", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Toshiba Laptop", "Author": "Tony S", "ReviewID": "RBD6WH0JZA4A7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like this product it is very light and runs cool and quiet, working well so far.

Overall, they are pieces of crap, but that is what I expected.  You get the typical bloatware of antivirus software, etc, and the build quality is pretty poor.
