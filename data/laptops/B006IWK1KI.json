For the money it is a real bargan. The look and feel are great. My only complaint is the OS. Windows crashed three times in the first two days. I replaced the Windows OS with Opensuse Linux. With the Linux OS everything works perfictly. It is a shame to see such a fantastic machine shipped with a poor OS", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love Toshiba!", "Author": "A. Kuhlmann", "ReviewID": "RFOIH4NTS8XAY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My last Toshiba laptop lasted me over 5 years and when the hard drive started failing i decided to buy a new one. Well my last one i payed $900, this one i payed under $400 and it already runs BETTER than my orignial. The fact that it's not actually run on POS Vista really helps...but it runs fast and does everything i need it to. Very happy especially considering what i payed for it. It's also nice to look at which is a bonus :)", "Date": "February 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love our laptops", "Author": "Joy Harvey \"Joy H\"", "ReviewID": "R3CK8C8R15QS66", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "4th toshiba satellite for us- easy keyboard placement, ease of use, styling, durable has held up well easy to update with additional memory if needed. Won't buy another brand. If kids using, be careful with hinges, can become loose with excessive wear, but was easily repaired locally. Still would choose for kids andadults alike.

VANDENLANGENBERG", "ReviewID": "RCTNMZSQP9O7R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first laptop. I've had it for about a month. I had a few friends suggest the Toshiba brand for laptops. I'm told Toshibas hold up well to the wear and tear of travelling with a laptop. I was very happy with the price and haven't had any problems with the computer. The size is perfect and it's pretty lightweight. It's comfortable to use and the battery lasts a long time. I don't know how I lived without a laptop and am very happy with my choice. I had been mulling it over forever.", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Toshiba laptop", "Author": "Kathy Smith", "ReviewID": "R364APKRCCYTIO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My daughter will be using it and really likes it.
