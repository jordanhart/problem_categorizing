{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Huge disappointment", "Author": "John Joss", "ReviewID": "R1N0V1H35XH7IX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This laptop (it would be my first--I've been desktop only) seemed to have everything I needed. It arrived, I set it up via the one sheet of paper that was the only documentation (no paper warranty included, and you'll see why this mattered in a moment).I live close to Google, who offer two WiFi sites, and there are six other local WiFi services, all with three or more connectivity bars. I knew that I could only access Lenovo's instruction guide and warranty if I got on line. Except that nothing I could do would connect it to any of the eight WiFi sources. I spent over an hour trying, and ended back, through the diagnostics, in the wonderful world of the 'recirculating loop' in which one chases one own tail and gets nowhere, merely returns to the diagnostics. (Note: I am not a computer neophyte and have been working with a series of machines starting with a Morrow (!) thirty years ago.)I called Lenovo customer support (long, complicated phone tree) and they confirmed my one-year warranty but could not help me. It was a software issue, they said, and connected me to the appropriate department. What a pity that the software is not warranted except at extra cost, on top of the purchase price.Decision: Lenovo laptop returned to Amazon.", "Date": "April 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Disappointing", "Author": "HRH Purry", "ReviewID": "R2AO38T2MHCLDD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Once setup was complete the battery remained at 98%. Two days later it dropped to 96%. After 35 minutes on the phone with Lenovo tech support the technician concluded that the system didn't recognize the battery. Because the issue had to do with the motherboard, not the battery, she advised to return the B590 to Amazon.This computer was purchased on the good reviews it earned thus far at Amazon. After the time invested setting up a new computer I would advise the buyer to beware. This laptop is also slow and performance quirky unless resorting to Alt/Ctrl/delete a few times each session isn't unusual.", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great customer support", "Author": "Carol  H.", "ReviewID": "R2RPZW9ATSFM9D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was setting it up and the letters were not correct -- a c was a q, an m was a comma, etc.  I was so disappointed.  There was a support phone number.  After many menu items I got a live person on the phone and she told me about a special button to push to start over and everything was fixed.

I returned it to Lenovo after a lot of phone conversation and received a brand new computer.  This would have been OK if I hadn't already loaded all my programs on it.  Microsoft Office could not be reinstalled because it had been used previously.Lenovo's quality control is definately lacking not to have picked a problem like the one I had.  I wasted a lot of time because of this.", "Date": "April 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Just What I Wanted, and No Windows 8!", "Author": "Booklover \"Librarian\"", "ReviewID": "R152BRG9OXSZKF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed to replace a laptop running the late lamented XP to use when we travel, though I am hanging onto the Satellite because it still works fine, I simply turned off the wi-fi.The Lenovo worked right out of the box and has had no problems connecting to any wi-fi locations so far.  It comes with 4GB of RAM and I added 4 more.  A rapid response from Crucial micro tech support informed me that 8GB is the maximum memory it can take which saved me from buying the wrong memory card.  The new card installed easily into the empty slot and it responds so much faster than my desktop running Windows 7 as well but which has only 2GB of RAM.If I were to quibble about anything it would be that the power button is invisible when turned off and the cd/dvd drive tray button is under the edge and almost imperceptible so you have to hunt with your finger to find it.  Marking its location with a sticker helped.", "Date": "June 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Number and Cap-lock screen icons are very annoying", "Author": "Michael W. Snell", "ReviewID": "R169C4ISH9T1T0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my first Lenovo laptop and I am very annoyed to find out that whenever the cap lock and/or number lock is engaged, there is an 3/4\" icon in the lower right side of the display on every screen you go to. As a person who is used to the number lock always being engaged, this one feature is almost enough to make me want to return the machine and go back to a Toshiba. A green light on the keyboard is very sufficient to let me know about something like this. Lenovo tech support could do nothing whatsoever to help resolve this issue.", "Date": "May 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect for most laptop users.", "Author": "Lee A. Vercoe \"TangSooPap\"", "ReviewID": "R3EHCMB93K03Y1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this for a family member that needed a Vista OS replacement and not wanting them to go through the hassle of trying to learn Win 8 this was the perfect choice. I have a Lenovo for myself purchased here on Amazon and I really like it. Mine is a more powerful model.Biggest headache was the set up. On powerup it needed 39 updates to the OS with several reboots. Why so out of date? That took quite a bit of time. I recommend using an Ethernet cable rather than WiFi initially to speed things up.Next headache is all the preinstalled software you need to deal with. If you don't want to go with the installed virus protection you next need to uninstall and install yours which is typical.This also had one of those PC checks that somehow found over 40 threats/problems on the machine right out of the box! Really? I got rid of that subscription based nonsense and installed Malwarebytes free.There were other pieces of crapware to get rid of and after installing Firefox and a couple other utilities it was over 3 1/2 hours before it was ready for them to use.My biggest complaint with Win type PCs is they are not easy for the average nontechnical person to simply plug in and run. There are far too many decisions to make. With all the crapware companies stuff on the hard drive they are getting worse. It's no wonder tablets are becoming more popular.
