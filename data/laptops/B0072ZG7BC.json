I bought used laptop and found that the battery doesn't work. I called HP and they helped me to solve the problem. Now I don't have any complains. It works fast and doesn't overheat.The only CON is the bottom cover - you must be VERY careful removing it. Pins are very fragile and it's easy to break them.", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "We bought three, mine has problems", "Author": "MSPC", "ReviewID": "RU1POMNQHM3CO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought three of these units from Tech For Less, they had great pricing and shipping service. Only later did I discover that in one of them the webcam and microphone were inoperative. After doing most testing it appears that the ribbon cable is not connected properly. Rather difficult to get at and re-insert. May need to go back to HP to be repaired. Notice that this was a complaint in one of the other reviews. Check this if you buy one.Otherwise, and maybe because of the webcam issue, the machine boots very slowly. After booting up, it seems fast enough. TheBeat audio is ok, but the \"subwoofer\" bass is virtually non-existent and over all the output through the beats  audio system speakers seems pretty weak. Perhaps I am expecting too much. Works fine with headphones...Unfortunately the \"Bright Screen\" has the typical problems for this type, severe glare in virtually all lighting situations. Anti glare screen is available, but at a very steep price.I did appreciate the 9 cell battery, while it is heavier, the additional available battery life is worth it.  However this laptop is not a lightweight so would not be so great for a true road user.", "Date": "March 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good equip", "Author": "jose aguilar", "ReviewID": "R1D86CJLE633EG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love mi Pavilion DV/ is great, excelent performance, i am very happy , I love mi Pavilion DV/ is great, excelent performance, i am very happy ,", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great laptop!", "Author": "DRVA", "ReviewID": "R183IVE7IXH4T3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this laptop for several months and it has a wonderful i7 processor, plenty of memory and a large hard drive.  The 17 inch monitor and keyboard is great for editing Excel, Word and PowerPoint presentations along with watching movies.  The speakers are good, too!  Most importantly, the battery life gets 8-9 hours of continuous use depending on what is running.

Everithing is looking good. Sound is perfect. BUT my built-in camera does not work, at all. I spent six hour trying to make it turn on... nothing. I called to HP, they said I need to send it to them, so they can see what's wrong with it. It will take a couple weeks to have it back. Tomorrow I'm going back to Micro Center and I'll change it to the same. I really like it. 4 stars for now", "Date": "September 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not Happy", "Author": "Dason Louthan", "ReviewID": "RWPFM8T5UTMSO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Im having to replace the charging cord already replaced the battery, the webcam cord was loose, the computer was scraped on the top. all in all im pissed but I guess I will live!", "Date": "January 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Everybody loves it", "Author": "Ron Bushe", "ReviewID": "R1R680F1MD6JLX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have this model at the office for some specialized software that we really only need one copy of for the entire office. (Statistics packages, Adobe Illustrator, software of that ilk.) If someone needs to use the software they come get the computer, use it and bring it back.The problem is that everybody LOVES this computer. They don't bring it back. You have to hunt it down, get them to admit they don't really need it anymore and pry it out of their hands. We're seriously considering buying another or two refurbished.The thing I like about it is the long battery life. Eight hours minimum. It's got a big, double height battery like some of the extended-life batteries available for other laptops. The screen is big, the keyboard is nice and tilted (because of the big battery) and we've had zero problems with it in the year-plus that we've had it. On the other hand, it's not a notebook that you would want to haul around on a business trip - too big and too heavy. Think of it as a portable that you can move around the house anywhere you want to use it, definitely a good alternative to a desktop.", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't worry.... fast and capable", "Author": "Mogur", "ReviewID": "R2T8W1E2OI0DKE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned this computer for about a year now.Primarily, I'm a gamer... Why didn't I purchase an Alienware? overpriced. The graphics card in this system is a 1 gig dedicated card. Once you figure out how to lock it to this graphics... you will have a much better experience.The only thing I wish I did was install an ssd drive for a boot drive. My kid and Fiance decided to upgrade my memory to 16 gig... Didn't make a big deal. i'd go 8 if I had ot do it over, and spend the balance on the SSD. Other than that... I'm completely happy with this system. Fast, I7, Good size HD/ Enough ram to not need anything.Don't worry about the system.
