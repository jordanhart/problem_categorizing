I spent a good time researching why my laptop battery wouldn't charge I even contacted Sony for support in hope that it's not a hardware related issue but they affirmed it's the battery and it should be under warranty. I went ahead and placed a second order in Amazon (same laptop, model, color etc). When I received my second laptop guess what? it had the same exact issue.It's probable that there are more VAIO svf15215cxw laptops in stock with this issue, I can't be the only one who received 2 brand new laptops with defective batteries.I'm sorry SONY but I already spent too much time dealing with the same issue twice.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worst product ever!", "Author": "bobbi Collins", "ReviewID": "R3ARXUOFKWX160", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Buyer beware! Purchased this product for my daughter. It worked for a month. Sent it in for service twice. No resolutions! Spoke to 9 customer service reps. They have sent me to yet another department. Worst $800.00 I have ever spent!! I will never buy a product from Sony again based on the customer service I received. It's sad when a company sees you as a number and not a person. Even sadder, when the product is of poor quality with a high price tag.", "Date": "December 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not good enough", "Author": "Willy Lam Ho", "ReviewID": "R3F4LUW2959T5V", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Bought a new one replacing my old vaio vgn series.  This hard drive is really slow,but plenty, Core i5, doesnt really work, I have the same Core i5 on a desktop and works flowlessly and twice faster.  Touchpad its simply a nighmare only a small area is good for mouse work, the rest gets really confusing.  Sensitivity its another nightmare sometimes you touch, nothing happens end up very anoyed (20 percent of the times), you will end up with a mouse.Design wise, its beatifull, flip and touchscreen are great, however a few hours later the edges will start hurting your lap or hand.  Battery wise is good, I get 4 plus hours.  Screen colours are just great, thats why I put 1 star for the beauty and 1 for the screen, I'll think bettery next time.Vaio has let me down this time.", "Date": "May 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Didn't Last", "Author": "Ona", "ReviewID": "R2XIHBCWB3KTM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Laptop is fast and slick with a nice touch screen, but the Windows 8 seriously blows goats and it comes with a Kaspersky trial that is a trap and just loads up a bunch of adware and spyware that you have to purge from your system to restore basic functionality.

I pulled it out of the box and it was illegally shipped with the battery already installed. When I recived it there were no Sony stickers on the bottom if it for product identification and no windows sticker with the serial number on it. I do believe I was over charged for a used laptop claiming to be new. I doubt I will buy any more computers from Amazon in the future, because this was not a new computer and was sold as a new one in the box.", "Date": "February 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "This computer is awesome.
