The only thing that I don't like is the hard drive which is 5400 RPM. It should be at least 7200 RPM to match the speed of the processor so that video editors like me don't have problem during rendering of video. The unit is over the need (requirement)for those who are just typing and doing some computer stuff but under rated for those who will use this for video editing and other task involving video rendering. I don't like the windows 8 as well, I cannot install some software that I need. They should adopt what windows7 have and compatible with. I give 4 star only because of the hard drive speed and windows8 compatibility.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pretty good laptop", "Author": "D. M.

I LOVE the BACKLIT KEYBOARD as I work a lot at night.  Best of all, does not overheat like previous HP. Stays VERY cool! Also, over twice as much battery time as previous model (app 4 hours, give or take). This is the best all-around HP laptop I've owned in its price range.

I've heard the horror stories about HP laptops, and their unreliable software, but this computer seemed like such a great buy for its features.  Little did I know...Approximately every hour I need to reset my WiFi adapter, or reboot the computer.  I've talked to the HP technical folks, all from foreign lands with very thick accents, and they are incapable of fixing the problem.  The HP website has many people complaining about the same problem, and no fix will last for more than a day.Simple features, such as hibernate/sleep mode upon closing the lid, never worked properly.  I often have found the computer heating up in my briefcase, simply because it turned itself back on spontaneously.If I had the time, I would populate every single HP laptop site with this complaint, since the HP software problems are inherent to all HP products.", "Date": "September 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "HP Envy dv6 with Intel core i7", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R210C2T15J5V3W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The shipment was on time and the computer is very fast.

As a physician, I have been using this device for my electronic medical records system which relies on wifi.

The battery satisfies my daily routines. The type of Games I play like Medieval War 2, but the graphics card can't handle any other games I love.

It informs me on start up at times, that the fan isn't working but in fact, the fan is ramped up as high as it will go and blowing papers off my desk! The keyboard isn't back lit and the keys are difficult to see even in fairly well lit room because of the black keys and white lettering and the ten key forces you to work off centered from the laptop which creates an ergonomic challenge so if you are NOT used to having a ten key and don't really need one, then I totally recommend not getting one. It's slow and unresponsive at times and definitely not what I'd expected from a late generation i7 processor. The fan runs all of the time even when idle which is something I'm not used to with my old laptop running only when needed to cool. The fingerprint reader is so glitchy that I'd rather just type passwords instead of swiping because eventually you will rub the paint off the surface of the top or suffer a sore finger from trying to get it to recognize.

It becomes so hot that any contact with the metal (or the cheap plastic) that covers the outside of the laptop will literally burn you.When I ask HP about it they said, \"Be more careful.\"  These people scammed my parents out of close to $1,000.  I am trying to return this crap, but HP will not assume responsibility for the defect.
