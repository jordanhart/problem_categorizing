{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I was very excited about my new $3000+ HP ZBook until it actually arrived...", "Author": "BBT", "ReviewID": "R3CITVL2PYO5EO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I shopped for a new laptop for close to 6 months and finally decided to purchase the new HP ZBook 17\" once I heard about it. I ordered the 4900 Haswell, 16 GB RAM, the Nvida 3100 graphics card and a couple of other upgrades. The cost for my system with the warranty and taxes was about $3800, more than I have ever spent on a laptop in my life.I was VERY excited as I opened the box when it came a few days ago. I turned it on and the screen was gorgeous! I got the operating system up and running at blazing speed and then I decided to check out the sound system.That is when my delight turned to dismay.The speakers sounded like my old computer speaker from my 1987 PC XT. I couldn't believe that a $3000+ laptop would have not had nice speakers. My 5 year old Toshiba laptop sounds fantastic and I was truly disappointed in the HP. I tried upgrading the audio drivers, I called HP customer service to see if there was a software upgrade, even something I could pay for and nothing. The systems speakers are just bad. Perhaps HP didn't think that a 'workstation' class laptop needed a upgraded sound system which is really sad since their lower class ENVY systems come with their upgraded Beats Audio system. ( you can't get the other upgrades with an ENVY laptop that you can with the ZBook however of course!)The other complaint I have about the ZBook is the backlit keyboard. If you look straight at the lit keyboard the keyboard looks great. If you angle the keyboard just slightly (like when you use the laptop in your lap) the light bleeds from underneath the keys so bright it is blinding. There are only 2 brightness settings so even at the low setting the light is overpowering coming from underneath the keys. Other laptops use a solid membrane on the keyboard so there is no light bleed if you angle the keyboard at all. Even a dimmer option instead of only 2 brightness settings would be an improvement. The laptop is dark charcoal and the keyboard is dark charcoal, so it is so dark that you absolutely need the lighted keyboard to see it. You are just limited at the angle at which you can use the laptop because of the light bleed from under the keys.The sorely inadequate speaker/sound system for a laptop of this caliber/price range and the poorly designed backlit keyboard were enough for me to return the laptop. I am now shopping for my dream laptop again. I find it really sad that the laptops with the fastest processors, the most memory, and the best sound systems are only gaming laptops that are targeted towards teenagers. There are many of us professional users that would appreciate the finest specs in a laptop that we would not be embarrassed to purchase. I really hope that HP upgrades these 2 things on the ZBook, They will have one heck of a laptop if they do.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,999.00", "Features": "HP ZBook 17 Mobile Workstation - 17.3\" - Core i7", "Name": "ZBook F2P72UT 17.3\" LED Intel Core i7 i7-4700MQ 2.40GHz 8GB RAM 750GB HDD Win 7 Pro 64-bit Notebook", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41AWs9e6AaL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00F0RCN76"}}
