It can handle games with fairly high requirements and is great for all sorts of media. The one complaint I have with it is that while the keyboard works great for gaming (my primary use for it), it is not comfortable to use when just typing out emails or reviews. Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this laptop to anyone who wants quality and performance for an affordable price.", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Its Ok", "Author": "Johnny Hidalgo Rivera", "ReviewID": "R5DWW9EA5A1S9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't try exhaustively but , runs fine, fluid.

I purchased the laptop refurbished for ~$340. The metal parts (lid and the part where you rest your hands) look pretty slick. This laptop also comes with radeon hd 7660 graphics card which is better than the one listed on the sales page. I'll edit my review in a few weeks once I have used it for a while.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Do NOT buy this computer. Headache!!!", "Author": "Kenny", "ReviewID": "RS3C37EZTWVZ4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop about 5 months ago... one of the worst decisions I've ever made. I have had to get it repaired twice already. The problem was that my touchpad (mouse pad) completely locked up and I could no longer use the mouse at all. I tried restarting it, shutting it down, taking the battery out, everything. So I sent it to Toshiba the first time (which was only 3 weeks after I bought it) had to pay $25 shipping to Toshiba to have them \"fix\" the problem. Toshiba informed me that they diagnosed it as a corrupt hard drive and said they replaced the hard drive, which later I found out that they did not! The second time was just yesterday for the exact same problem with my touch pad (that Toshiba claimed they \"fixed\") and I had to purchase Tech support for the laptop's software problem for $170 through TechZilla.com because the 1 year warranty only covered Hardware issues. After talking with the technician at TechZilla, I found out that in the 3 years he worked there this was a very common issue with Toshiba Laptops. So the technician had to spend literally two and half hours fixing via wi-fi connection. He told me he had to re-write the connection codes between the touchpad and computer, Or something of the sort. All in all I would say that the computer memory, ram, etc has been great! However this 5 month old computer with it's constant issues has been nothing but a headache. I wish I never would have bought this cursed machine lol. Lesson learned through this, it's worth it to pay the extra money for a Mac. That is all.", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Toshiba has gone the way of the doe doe.", "Author": "W. freeman", "ReviewID": "R29W0FKUSCGJN0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've been an Acer fan since 1997, had my first major Desktop from them and it ran forever. I use to like Toshibas laptops back in the day, 2004 till about 2009 or so when they really took pride in their machines. Now they are cheap plastic toys, and fall apart like leaves in the fall. First off the lid has horrible wobbling when you open it, the keys smash down into the body of the computer like grapes on pavement. The fan runs either constantly, or it can't decide and kicks on and off, on and off etc. Very loudly i might add. The speakers are horrible, i have headphones that are much louder. And the over all feel of the machine is just bad. It's really a shame when a company like Emachines (now owned by Acer) makes (made) a better quality laptop the Toshiba. I had one back in 2010, and it was built rock solid, tiny speaker sound, and a decent processor, but definitely better than this doorstop. I remember taking this out of the box thinking, are you kidding me?I have an Acer 17.3 inch laptop that i got in 2010 as well, and it is fantastic, never an overheating issues, burned literally 100's of discs (maybe more), converted movies, great speaker volume, and the body is made very firm, with a good solid feel. I was never an AMD fan either, sure you get 4 cores, and it's more powerful than my laptop, but honestly, who games on them anymore? Hence the cheap price, look on Wal-Mart and the computer is 578$, ask why? Now you know. So good specs, don't mean your getting a good reliable quality machine. I've loved the underdog, (Acer) for years, and it's been great. Even my girlfriends new Gateway is made far superior. I miss the old Toshibas. Even the higher end models suffer from problems, i work on desktops only. But i've heard many people say they get more HP's Dell's and Toshibas coming through with problems, more than any others. So buy at your own risk. They didn't even make this model for 8 months, and now they are gone. Or overstocked at Wal-Mart.
