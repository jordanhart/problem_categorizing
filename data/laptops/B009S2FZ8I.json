{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Incredible", "Author": "tuc62697", "ReviewID": "R3KSTGMGSE4WL2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First I should mention that I purchased an upgraded version of this laptop - SSD instead of HDD and more RAM, although 4Gb is sufficient on its own.So, this is an awesome computer. The dual-tone carbon fiber body makes this thing ergonomic, durable as hell, and look sophisticated too. The trackpad and keyboard are well designed, the speakers are loud, clear, and well placed. The overall weight and size makes it easily portable. The matte screen is a big plus too. Overall I applaud the design for being both rugged and elegant at once; it really feels like high quality when you handle it. Powers up very quickly, as does waking from sleep. Battery life is very long (not as long as advertised, but battery life never measures up to as advertised anyway). Graphics are great, some light computer games played very well, never have problems with several heavy programs running.Overall great ultrabook. Great for students and professionals. (Only annoying thing is that the keyboard is not backlit.) The only better laptop imo seems to be the newest Zenbook, which is easily $300 more than this guy. P.S- if you're interested in getting this, customize it through Exotic PC. . . the price is unbeatable.", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good laptop - reasonable price", "Author": "Richard J.
