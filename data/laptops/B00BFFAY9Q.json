This is a nice step up from the X220 in terms of screen size, memory capacity and disk size.  The speakers are a vast improvement over the X220 - they are aimed up (not down like the X220) so you can actually hear them.  The sound quality is crap compared to my 5 year old personally owned HP notebook, but its good for a Lenovo.  This is a workstation, not a media computer.ThinkPads have traditionally had the benefit of IBM's awesome keyboards - the best in the industry for touch typists.  However, this stinker is clearly not an IBM legacy.  The \"Chicklets\" style keyboard is terrible for a touch typist - you get NO feel for individual keys and the tactile feel is worse than the $15 Kensington USB keyboard I had lying around.The placement of the power button is another design faux pas - right next to the frequently used End, Insert and Delete keys - you quickly lean to save frequently.  This placement, when combined with the poor feel of the keyboard results in \"oh crap\" moments when you miss a key and hit power by mistake.Ergonomically the power button should have been placed near less frequently used keys - like the F9 or F10 key.Overall, it is a workstation with good capacity (screen size, CPU, memory and disk) but poor keyboard.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solid product", "Author": "Dennis J Woods \"D Woods\"", "ReviewID": "R12PYR76JUH0R6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For one of my employees and it has handled everything we've thrown at it so far.

She's always like the Thinkpad issued by my company because of the excellent screen, keyboard and sturdy construction.  We'd been holding out because we can't stand Windows 8 and there were few choices of laptops available with Windows 7.This laptop is just what we wanted.  I was delivered with almost no crapware that I needed to remove.  It has most of the same features of my $1K+ Thinkpad for a fraction of the price.  Actually, the only things it doesn't have are the fingerprint reader and the backlit keyboard.  Other than that, it's hard to tell the difference between the two machines.Anyway, this is the real deal.  It's a serious business laptop with quality construction and a REAL keyboard without the typical junk installed running on Windows 7.
