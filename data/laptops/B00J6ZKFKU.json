{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Capable Machine", "Author": "Ben \"Pizza Enthusiast\"", "ReviewID": "R1QS7WOYC7MOV5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My HP dv6 served me well for four years before it gave me any major problems, but rather than repairing it I opted to purchase a newer, more powerful machine: the Asus X550ca.The specs in this laptop are pretty standard, but the i5 processor is an upgrade from the i3 in my HP. I have not noticed a huge difference between the two yet, but I just acquired the Asus today and will continue to monkey around with it. Things do run very smoothly on this machine.Allow me to give you, the consumer, an overview of some of this machine's features.AESTHETICS/DESIGNThe X550ca is surprisingly light for its size, which is an immediately recognizable plus. I like the way the keyboard is situated (on some laptops I've noticed the keyboard feels like it is too far left in comparison to the screen; not so with this machine), though the arrow keys are pretty cramped. The touchpad, on the other hand, is off to the left-hand side of the laptop and does not have a scrollbar (I haven't explored whether or not I can program it to let me scroll yet, either). This simply will not cut it for left-handers.Another plus in the X550ca's design is that dust and dirt will not collect easily in its cracks and crevices (of which it has very few), nor will fingerprints and scuffs be noticeable on its steel-colored frame. The charger port is on the left-hand side of the machine near the back corner, and it is on this side of the laptop where one may find all of its other ports. It has two USB ports, but they are side-by-side, making it impossible to use certain devices at the same time (for example, you will be unable to use two flashdrives simultaneously, and I can imagine various cords also being too fat to fit next to each other). This annoys me more than it probably should.As for the CD/DVD drive, it's on the right side of the machine towards the back. The first time I opened and closed it the darn thing kept popping back out. I'm not sure if the button stuck or if it was just being sassy because it's brand new, but this will warrant watching as I get to know the X550ca better. There is also a dual purpose headphone/microphone jack on the left side of the laptop which will likely serve most people's needs, but I can already foresee it giving me problems if I lay down any guitar tracks with this machine (I often use headphones and a mic at the same time).PERFORMANCEI haven't pushed the X550ca yet, so I cannot provide much information here. I plan to use this machine for personal use only, and I am not much of a gamer so I can't comment on that aspect of its performance either. No worries, though; I'll update this review as I get to know the laptop better.What I can say at this point is that its battery life is excellent, especially considering the 15.6 inch screen size. Using the default balanced power setting I got 4 hours out of the X550ca, 90 minutes of which I spent watching a documentary in full-screen mode. As I write this, the battery meter sits at 48% with an estimated 2 hours 12 minutes of life remaining. Not bad! Recharge time is also very quick.MISCELLANEOUSOn my HP there was a volume pad and a Wi-Fi pad above the keyboard that allowed the user to adjust or disable those things without clicking anything. The X550ca has no such bells and whistles, and so far the keyboard volume buttons have proven unresponsive. I'm looking into this problem.I also must lament the Windows 8 configuration. Even as someone who owns (and loves) a Windows Phone, I don't like the way the tiles navigate on a computer, and it has already irritated me greatly. Even in desktop mode Windows 8 can be greatly aggravating.**********If there is anything specific you would like to know about the X550ca, please leave a comment. I'll be writing regular updates as I discover this machine's secrets and capabilities!**********EDIT 4/21/14:After a week with the X550ca, I am still impressed with its performance. The only issues I have encountered with speed have all been due to internet problems. The i5 processor truly is a workhorse; even with a dozen programs running and another one downloading I have not noticed any drop-off in speed. The machine barely makes a sound while it's running either.Battery life is also still excellent. I get 4 hours minimum on a full charge, and I've maxed it at 6 hours when I refrain from watching any video content. The X550ca's best feature? Boot-up time is nonexistent. It goes from sleep mode to ready-to-use in 3 seconds.Regarding the potential problems I wrote about initially: Even after doing some further research I have no idea why the volume keys (f10, f11, and f12) don't work. They perform actions, just not volume-related ones. The disc drive had also proven troublesome (popping out repeatedly instead of remaining closed), but this issue was rectified simply by giving it a little muscle. If I jam it home, it stays where it's supposed to.**********EDIT 4/27/14:Thanks to a commenter, the volume key issue has been resolved. It's simply a matter of using the function key properly (and I swear I tried this without success before, it works fine now).I've also transferred all my files from my HP to the X550ca. I was a little nervous this would slow down my new machine (I transferred about 100 GB of data), but its performance has not suffered at all.**********EDIT 4/30/14:Apparently the X550ca is just too much of a computer for me, because all the issues I experienced initially are turning out to be easy fixes. For instance, the latest one I solved is the touchpad. Initially, I couldn't figure out how to program it to scroll. Turns out it has the \"two-finger touch\" action that allows for horizontal and vertical scrolling (this is the default setting). Similarly, when I finally began playing around with the customizable options I was blown away by the sheer amount of choices I have. I've further adjusted the power features to bring the average battery life close to 5 hours, even with many programs running. All in all, I'm still quite pleased with this machine.**********EDIT 5/13/14:A quick update... I ran into some malware and adware trouble last week. I'm sure anyone who knows a thing or two about computers doesn't need to hear this, but don't plan to rely on the free 30 days of McAfee anti-virus that comes with this Asus laptop. I am also unhappy to report that the average battery life has decreased to about 3-4 hours, though I suspected this might happen after I loaded the hard drive with files and downloaded a slew of new programs. It does, however, still perform admirably when watching video content.", "Date": "April 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very pleased", "Author": "Chuck M. \"imaref\"", "ReviewID": "RNCWP6SS7MNHS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Traded in my old XP laptop for credit on this Windows 8 laptop. I waited until Windows 8.1 became available before doing this since I heard horror stories about Windows 8.Overall I'm quite pleased. After upgrading to Windows 8.1 I was able to install lots of software that supposedly doesn't work well with Windows 8 but I've had no problems (especially with Adobe Creative Suite 3). It works like a charm.The computer is quite fast. I've done lots of video editing already (Pinnacle Studio 16) with no problems or crashes. I did quite a bit of tweaking (like we all do), especially turning off lots of the visual eye candy so everything runs faster.What I like:1. Design is excellent. It will be very easy to keep this machine clean.2. Trackpad (which I use ALOT) is very sturdy.3. Intel Core i5 processors blow away every other computer in my house.4. Screen looks great.5. As soon as I got the laptop, I downloaded all of the updates from MIcrosoft, then downloaded Windows 8.1 and its updates. I really like it, especially since it boots right to the desktop and when I want to go to the tile screen, I can do so easily.6. I have a fast internet connection (50 down, 6 up) so it was quick to do the updates but overall this laptop just seems very snappy.7. It's really, REALLY quiet. I had Speedfan installed on my other laptops to keep checking the temperature but this laptop runs very cool.8. It does NOT have a built in video card and I was told I may have problems doing video editing. Haven't run into any problems yet.What could be better:1. There is 4GB of RAM and I'm going to upgrade. According to the manual, it can use up to 10GB of RAM but there is only one memory slot so I'm going to upgrade to 8GB RAM. Not sure how you would get 10GB of RAM.2. On the left side near the front are 1 3.0 USB port and 1 UBS 2.0 port, but none on the right side or the back. I use a USB hub with this laptop so it hasn't been a problem.3. The internal hard drive is 5400rpm so I will be upgrading to a 7200rpm drive a little later. They recommend an SSD drive as an upgrade, but I don't trust SSD drives yet. Technology of the SSD drives needs another year or two in my opinion.4. The ASUS site where you download drivers isn't great. It's ok. I like the Dell drivers site better.If you were waiting to skip Windows 8 (like I was), it's ok to get a new computer now since Windows 8.1 is out. It is a nice balance between desktop and apps, far different than what the first version of Windows 8 was like. I will warn you that I've been messing around with the laptop for a few hours each day over the past week, and I'm just now feeling comfortable where to find everything.Very good experience to this point. This is my first ASUS computer (I've always had Dells) and I think I made a good decision. It's very solid in both design and performance, and ASUS seems to give a very good value for the amount of money spent.UPDATE: so I decided to go ahead and upgrade the RAM. Every place that this computer is listed says that it has one memory slot and it upgradeable to 6GB RAM total. I got one stick 8GB RAM assuming that I could remove the stick of 4GB RAM, install the 8GB RAM and it would recognize 6GB RAM. I bought the 8GB RAM, opened the back and saw that there were TWO memory slots, one on top of the other. The bottom one had the 4GB RAM and the top one was empty. I installed the 8GB stick in the empty slot, booted up, and now the computer recognizes 12GB RAM! Nice surprise! If you're thinking about upgrading the RAM, I suggest that you open the cover first and see if you have two memory slots (bottom one used, top one empty).
