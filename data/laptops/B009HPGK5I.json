{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent laptop for the price.", "Author": "Tejas R Padekar", "ReviewID": "R3AIBA6J18JXE7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received my laptop just a few days ago, and boy, does it change the way I work with laptops! Having a touchscreen makes it easier to use Windows 8 and Windows 8's UI makes you want to constantly reach out and touch the screen.This is an early review, so all I'll say is that the laptop is very nicely built. It feels like it'll endure a lot and it has almost no flex when I lifted it with just one edge and the screen opened. Some laptops feel like they're going to \"spill over\" when you lift them like this, but not the Sony Vaio T13. There are a few sharp corners in the front corners, but they're not sharp enough to cause cuts or anything. I, as a matter of fact, like the corners. The aluminium build is very solid.The sound is much better than I expected for a laptop of this size and weight! It's good enough to be close to the quality of sound on m 13\" Macbook Pro. The MBP has slightly better range and maybe depth, but it does cost a whole lot more than this beauty here!The only disappointment is the screen. Although a pretty decent screen for the cost, you do wonder how much of a difference an IPS panel or at least something better with slightly wider viewing angles would have made. This is the only sore point in my opinion.Overall, I'd say I'm very happy with the purchase. The delivery - handled by DataVision - was prompt and quick. It was delivered well within time and in good condition!", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Ultrabook-could be smaller & have longer battery life", "Author": "nerdindenial", "ReviewID": "R27X4H7UIBB19W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the Sony SVT13126CXS in December 2012, along with a very similar Samsung NP540U3C-A01UB Windows 8 touchscreen ultrabook. I first applied all available software updates from the vendors and from Microsoft, and then connected them wirelessly to an elevated ASUS RT-AC66U router and installed the Intel Anti-Theft technology software (see my review at Amazon if interested). For the purposes of this review I will compare the Sony to the Samsung, since these machines are quite different from the Windows 7 PCs that I have in the same environment.Regarding the utility of Windows 8 and touchscreens, using this system feels like a cross between using a Windows computer and a smartphone. Using the touchscreen lets you do some fun things with multi-touch gestures, but the price to be paid is that content creators (i.e. users of Desktop legacy software) have to do a few extra keystrokes or touches to start their tasks. Since all new Windows laptops ship with Windows 8, I thought it best to pay a little extra and get a touchscreen ultrabook. Certainly the light weight and 5 hour battery life are a big improvement over my old Dell E6510 laptop. However the Dell achieves twice the wireless N throughput (90 Mbit/second at 45 foot range through 4 walls) of either the Sony or the Samsung.The Sony is about 0.3 inches wider and longer than the Samsung, and looks bigger, due to its angular outer edges. It has been criticized for its noisy fan (lack of a power management system cooling policy setting), although I haven't found that to be a problem. Both systems fit in a Case Logic 13 inch ultrabook case. The Sony's Windows 8 Experience Index Score (top to bottom) is 6.9/7.3/4.8/6.3/5.9. Compared to the Samsung, the strong points of the Sony are: (1) Wireless connection never drops unexpectedly, (2) Sony software and touchpad driver never stops working or glitches, and do not keep prompting you to install software you may not want or need, (3) The Windows 8 Experience Index memory score is 7.3, vs. 5.9 on the Samsung, and the same-priced Sony ships with 6GB instead of 4GB RAM on the Samsung, and (4) The Sony AC power connector is large and should not be accidentally damaged.It looks like the Samsung may have 1 hour longer battery life than the Sony, because its memory runs slower and its fan runs less often. The Samsung also has more comprehensive advanced processor power management settings than the Sony does (e.g. a System cooling policy).The bottom line for me is that the Sony has very good performance, software, reliability, and polished features - so I recommend it at this price point.", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Ultrabook", "Author": "Paul Kim", "ReviewID": "R3TVAEBM186G9N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not sure why my previous review is gone, but I want to say I am very happy with my purchase!It is extremely light (~3.5 lbs) and fast.Battery lasts ~4.5 hours under normal use (internet, etc.)The multi-touch touchpad is really pragmatic and comfortable once you get used to it.You may want to buy a keyboard cover from Sony for about $20. It's a bit expensive but worth it.Screen is bright but not perfect  (compared to retina screens in some other computers and devices).. resolution is a bit lacking.Sony's rapid wake function lets computer go to sleep without draining battery and wakes it up within 4 seconds! it's awesome.Speakers are not superb but excellent for a small device!I used to own a 15.6 laptop so I was hesitant about buying a 13.3 inch laptop, but I've had no problem!Great computer for portability, and extremely stylish.Considering it's Sony, I am sure I can live with this baby for years.", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Plagued with touchscreen and touchpad problems, poor support", "Author": "D. Freedman", "ReviewID": "R1KOUNUHKL5A5F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Certainly the main attraction of this model is getting the touchscreen, a critical feature for taking advantage of Windows 8, and making this computer's price attractive. The touchscreen worked fine out of the box, and for about 20 hours of use after that, but then starting working irregularly, and often not at all. I can't use most of the touch features of Windows 8 now. Even worse, the touchpad also stopped working, apparently for different reasons. I've spent hours on the phone with Sony Vaio support, and while they were eventually able to solve the touchpad problem (for now, at least, though occasionally it still freezes), they are clueless about the touchscreen, and have wasted a lot of my time having me restoring and reloading software and drivers, all to no avail. They've finally told me I should send the machine to them. My last experience with a Vaio suggests that what will happen is that they will wipe out the disk, reload the original software, and send the machine back to me, so it can fail again. I think this is the machine that will finally drag me into the Mac world.Windows 8 with a (working) touchscreen on an ultrabook is a pretty good combination, by the way. My main complaint would be that the new tablet-like apps designed to take advantage of the touchscreen seem more geared to a phone or small tablet--they tend to be somewhat stripped down in terms of functionality, presumably to be able to limit the screen to a few easy-to-press buttons, which is useful on a small screen but an unnecessary trade-off on a 13-inch notebook.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Value in an Ultrabook", "Author": "C.

Lots of light weight good lookers, my wife loved the Vaio.  We returned home to do the real research.  I was really put off by the reports of noise - I'm an audio engineer and the slightest bit of noise can drive me nuts.  I'm in the process of rebuilding my desktop to run silently and all I can say is that I hope it can be half as quiet as this laptop is.  While I had concerns about the small built in SSD being used as some sort of cache for the OS in a sleep state it works great, it's a very snappy computer.

However, I think we could expect more than it is as there are many good ultrabooks in the market nowadays. My principal dissatisfactions towards to this laptop are: 1.

Windows Experience score is 4.5  out of a possible 7.9.  The individual score were: processor- 6.8,  Ram- 5.9, Graphics- 4.5,  Gaming graphics- 6.2, Hard drive- 6.9.  My computer background goes back a long way to the old Intel 186 processors,  big bulky CRT monitor,  and OMG!  DOS software and floppy drives.  I've got several laptops, desktops, and tablets.  So the hardware is decent (with a few quirks), software decent and speedy.  A couple of quirks:  as some posters have pointed out,  the keyboard gets some getting used to because the keys are flat and there are no home feeling keys to situate yourself on.  Also the mousepad right and  left aren't just where you would think they you they should  be.  For example, the right click button is close to where  where it should be ..... but left from where it should be, by about an inch.  I just put a black mark there to indicate where the right click button really is.  Other than those 2 ideosyncrasies.  I really like this computer....just the right size,  fast, plays instant movies great with no \"buffering\",  and you can run several programs at the same time without the computer locking up.  Plays Amazon, and Netflix movies fine with no delays.  I also  read books on my Kindle desktop app.  Overall, very minor complaints, and I would buy this  Laptop again.addendum after 3 weeks of use.  Sound is pretty good even though the speaker are tiny.  No bass but good midrange and treble.UGHHHH!  Addendum to the addendum.  Hard drive started making ticking noises, then rattling noises , then crashed as I was chatting with a Sony tech. Blue screen of death!  Got on the phone with a very knowledgeable Sony tech and he had me run a hard drive test , which it failed.  He said to take it to UPS with the power cord and they will take care of sending it back to the factory repair facility at no charge to me. I've only had it 3 weeks.  We'll see ....09/17/13 Update. I would rate the Tech Support a 5 out of 5  excellent. They quickly diagnosed the HD problem, gave me a ticket number and I took it to The UPS Store who mailed the computer next day air ,at no charge to me, back to a Service Center in Texas.  I got the computer back, with a new HD, in less than 10 days.  Works great now.", "Date": "August 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent for the price, but had a couple issues", "Author": "Matthew S. Anderson", "ReviewID": "R1RTIDMBRY84BZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This computer has replaced an 11.6\" Acer that I loved, but needed a speed upgrade.Upsides:  I'm liking the speed and light weight of the computer.  It's slim and has a great design, which is Sony's strength.  I am loving the 1-2 second turn-on when I open the screen.  The SSD quickness made me go and upgrade my desktop computer too, so it has clearly impressed me.  Battery life is decent (4-5 hours).  Nothing compared to the Acer Timeline's 8 hours (for real), but after owning it for 3 years, I realized I didn't travel enough to need the long battery, so 4 hours is plenty for my day-to-day.  Otherwise, the positives are the same things you'll find on many current laptops:  USB3, hybrid drive, decent battery, pretty light weight, i5 processor, 6GB ram... I'm also not bothered by the fan noise.  It's noticeable, but not what I'd call loud like some full-size laptops that are trying to cool an i7 at 3.4GHz.Downsides:While I enjoyed the feel of the keyboard in the store, I'm finding that the shallow stroke of the keys has me not knowing whether I actually hit a key, and I often have missed or double keystrokes as a result.  This is only after a few weeks of sporadic use, so I may get attuned to it.  Second, the trackpad is very touchy.  My Acer (same synaptics line of drivers) was not nearly as jumpy.  Often when I go to make a double click, when I release the mouse goes zipping off randomly (I have momentum set to ON... I actually like it.  I like to toss the mouse and catch it elsewhere instead of tracking all the way across the screen, though with this trackpad I can't rely on it to go exactly where I want it to).  The trackpad buttons also don't have a consistent, uniform feel like my Macbook (work laptop).  It's hard to tell if I'm really getting the press.Lastly, and this is not a generalization about all Vaios, my touchscreen failed TWICE.  Once after 3 weeks of use.  I went through a battery of tests on the phone with tech support (they were excellent btw) before sending it in for repair.  Then 1 day after it was returned, it failed again.  I've now had it for 2 weeks since the last repair and it's ok.  FYI, it seems that the touchscreen is actually on an internal USB port.  When the touchscreen failed, I got a USB error popup, and Unknown Device in Device Manager.  So keep an eye out for that.So, I've owned the laptop since mid-January, but it's been out for repair for about half of that time.  I'm not totally bummed about the purchase because maybe it's just a fluke and life will be great from here on out.  And the friendly and patient tech support staff definitely make a difference to my opinion expressed here.  With less helpful support I'd drop the score down to 2 stars at best.", "Date": "March 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "excelente producto", "Author": "Hazofeifa", "ReviewID": "R39R9EZVTBMJ7L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Es un excelente producto, lo recomiendo mucho y es exactamente como lo descrito por el vendedor, tambien el empaque fue adecuado y lleg\u00f3 en buenas condiciones, sin da\u00f1os ni problemas", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "very good product", "Author": "winnie_lingyu", "ReviewID": "R20LRGS4SCGE6U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it is very cute and light in weight. and I was surprised that I thought I was not going care about if it touch screen or not, I thoughtI was not going to really need it but I was totally wrong.

After an initial distaste, I learned that the Start screen is a pretty good application launcher if you ignore all the Metro style things.  Don't be fooled though: the touch feature is not useful, most of time the keyboard and mouse/trackpad will be your input of choice.  Reaching over the keyboard to touch the screen is unintuitive, wastes time and effort, and will quickly be something you stop using because it is faster and easier to not use it.The part where Windows 8 kills it is the latest update.  On Dec. 14, 2012 I got a Windows 8 update.  It installed, rebooted, and broke the physical keyboard and trackpad (as in they don't work).  The touch screen was the only way to interact with the computer.  I quickly learned how touch un-friendly Windows 8 is once you need to do something more than read email.The only way to get the keyboard and mouse back is to reset the computer to factory conditions.  I did so after talking to Sony support.  Restarted, this time with automatic updates off; that didn't help, the update was installed anyway, the keyboard and trackpad was broken, so I had to re-set the computer to factory a second time.  This time I turned off Windows Updates, turned off the Vaio update manager but still the update was installed and the keyboard/trackpad broken.Sony says they do not have Windows 7 drivers for this computer.I can only suggest that you do not purchase this computer until either Windows 8 or Sony fixes the issue.", "Date": "December 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "the worst", "Author": "hazem", "ReviewID": "R35YKQ2KSAIUXM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was the worst lap top i had in my life,very bad customer serviceI lost my money on this laptop, and now i regret it.I am not gonna buy any Sony products in the future.", "Date": "May 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Terrible product!!!", "Author": "thinh ngo", "ReviewID": "R28V06PZXKBT4K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Warranty is for 1 year.

I purchased this Ultrabook for my father this past Christmas.  I bought it on cyber Monday and bought that I got a pretty good deal.  It is now March and it already does not work.  My dad dropped it off at my house I ran diagnostics on it.  I figured out that the OS seems corrupted.So, I contacted ePark: I opened a return through amazon and a couple days later I get a one lined e-mail that reads.  YOUR OUT SIDE YOUR WARRANTY WINDOW status: CLOSED. That's it!Okay?!  I called square trade.  Now, my hats off to these guys!  They were efficient and answered all my questions.  However, they told me that the Ultrabook is still under manufactures warranty. GREAT, I think I will use the free warranty!  They give me the phone number to customer support.Now... The \"new and improved\" Sony support center.  Support should first of all be taken out of the name.  I first talk with tech support.  Okay, I will run through your test to make sure that my Ultrabook is indeed broken.  Awesome, [sony support] you also, think my computer is broken.  No, problem transfers me to the next person.  Now, I did not expect what was coming next.  \"Okay, Eric\"  she says  \"I see that your Ultrabook has a corrupted file on it and you need the restore software.  That will be $149.99'!!\"This did not go over very well...  They wanted to charge me for a recovery disc and buy an external cd/dvd drive because it is an Ultrabook and does not have one.  I told her that I am not doing that.  Anyway finally got the disc for $6 and even got them to pay for shipping.  It only took two and a half hours and some reasoning.  Picked up an external off newegg with a rebate for $24.99.  So, for $31.00 I should be able to get my Dad's computer fixed.

Not sure why I keep it.  During the warranty period, AND the extended warranty periodit spent probably more time in their hands then mine.  Almost each and every part of this computer broke.  Whenthe power source (that is connected to the MOTHER BOARD) broke for the 3rd time I was actually thankful because itnow classified as a lemon. IT doesn't matter if every part of the internal workings of your computer goes, or it needs sent in 8 times in 18 months it can only be a lemon if one thing breaks 3 times.  Which sucked because I was racking up 2x on a few things...but never a third time. Then the power source finally did a 3rd.  Wow I now classify as a lemon.  Only they beat me on the warranty.  On the outside of your computer, there is a hole that the power source will plug into.  My model of the VAIO had a tiny piece of circular plastic inside that hole. CompUSA tech the very first time it broke (and this was a geek from heaven tech...so nice and wonderful) used a tweezer to help my power cord stay connected and download me all my stuff on it before it went for repair. This never affected the computer or any other repair from hard drives to fans, to key boards to DVD player to Ram and so on.It was an outside part of the computer house.  In fact Sony kept repairing it & I kept going without a computer.  A warranty only last so long. When the external power supply finally racked up a 3rd time they wouldn't honor it, because it required giving me a new computer.  They claimed the broken little ring of plastic was damage to the computer even if it was on the outside of the computer & doesn't have ANYTHING to do with the repair at all. They had been repairing this computer all along for every part over and over again...until they did their best to find any reason possible to NOT honor a warranty. I suppose that I could have gone against Comp USA.  I almost did.  But this was such BULL I wasn't going to involve the tech that had been so decent to me in two years, in a corporate mess that was unfair & wrong on Sony's part.  Your probably thinking I just was abusive to computers.  WRONG.  I've owned them since they weighed a ton, no one visioned a lap top in life and I design graphic frames.  I have my own geek corner.  With 3 systems in a row.  I know how to be with a computer.  In fact I have one that works perfect I bought during this fiasco on my long desk set up a few feet from me.  Don't trust them in customer care.  They will look for every possible loop hole to back out of their warranty if it costs them.  This was beyond ridiculous that I had to buy another system to have a computer that was a lap top since I picked the VAIO.  They are so wrong as a corporation.  I don't want to see anyone, who ever you are get taken the way I did...if your unlucky & get a lemon shipped to you. They exist...lemons.  Which is fine but you don't have to do a person in if they were the unlucky one to have that shipped to their house. Please dear lord...get another brand.  Yes it works great.  I remember that.

Played around with Windows 8. It's not too bad. Entered the BIOS to check it out. Changed the boot option from UEFI to Legacy Boot just too see if I can boot from the external CD Drive from a disc that doesn't have GPT partition. Reboot and no operating system is found. Not a problem I thought. I'll just go back into the BIOS and change things back. Nope, there's no way to enter the BIOS after that. Tried using a different hard drive, USB drive, different CD-ROM image. Still won't boot and still won't let me enter BIOS. Looked on the web saying to press F2 repeatedly after the VAIO splash screen or to use a USB keyboard. Nothing works.Now, I'm not new to computers having been around them since the mid-80s and having worked on esoteric hardware such as the old 68k Macs, Sun Sparcstation IPC/IPC/UltraSPARC machines, etc.I finally broke down and called tech support (was with them for a good 40 minutes), and she told me to repeatedly press F2 after the VAIO splash screen. Still nothing. Every x86 computer I've owned (excluding Apple Macs) had a little text display in the corner saying what button to press to enter BIOS or at least a boot menu. Even my HP Pavilion dm1 has this. But not this stupid VAIO. The only consolation is that Sony is paying to have the machine shipped to their facility to have it fixed.Absolutely would not buy another VAIO ever again, no matter how good the price is.*EDIT*Thanks to the poster below me for pointing me in the right direction.
