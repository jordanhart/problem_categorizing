We're talkin' Win 7 64 bit, 3 USB ports, HDMI, cardreader, 4 gig ram, 320 gig HD, 15\" display, 6 cell batt, Intel CPU, DVD burner.  I'm continually amazed at these prices and values.  Picked one up for the in-laws so grampa could have his own laptop!  For web browsing, pictures, and the basics, you don't need to spend over $350 with today's prices.My only complaint is the Function keys are reversed (why would they do that??).  If you want to use the actual F1-F12 keys, you need to hold down the FN key.  This means that these keys work directly to enable/disable things like wi-fi and trackpad etc.  So if grampa inadvertently hits the F3 key, he'll turn off the wi-fi.  I don't think this was a smart decision by Acer/Gateway.UPDATED - Never mind my complaint about the function keys!  As noted in the comment section, this can be changed in the BIOS setup - SWEET!!", "Date": "August 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bargain Laptop", "Author": "tipstir \"My Professional Review\"", "ReviewID": "R3F5QXXSOHHXBO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Also got this for $250 from Target. I only got it since I had the top end model since 2010. The only difference between the two is the CPU one Intel this one and the other is AMD. Both dual core 2.0GHz vs 1.7GHz in this one. But the L2 cache is 2MB instead of 1MB in the one I had. Same 4GB of RAM but this one can be upgraded to 8GB. Both have the same LED/LCD HD panel. Mine has optional Blue-Ray player that gives you higher contrast panel very deep blacks. Other than that the keys placement is the same. You'll learn to live with it in time. For the price this is not a bad laptop if your in the market for one. The Target sale will end when they're gone no rain checks. But if you can get one or more time is right to give all your kids and you and the wife one. Can't go wrong with this purchase. It only comes in one color black with touch of grey. Panel is glossy ultra bright you want that type of panel you don't want flat matted type ones are washed out look and older technology LCD it has to be LED which this one is.3x USB ports1x Full HDMI port1x SDHD Card Port1x Power1x Stereo Head phonesThe one I have has all of that plus red amber lite soft touch controls. Still this one not that heavy like the one I have. If you able to get on one buy it!Update 8.12.12Had order additional 4GB from Amazon for $21 and install it. Now 8GB with 7.48GB usable. Index rating gone up from out to the box 4.5, then tweaked changing the system from the default power (Balance) to High Power 4.9 and now it's 5.0.1. Before you do anything with this tablet you need to get Norton Removal tool too take off the bloatware.Run that twice. Freeware just search for it on Google2. Run Pc-Decrapifier (freeware) That finds everything you have installed and then you choose what to take off. Hint keep all ACER software.3. SmartDefrag (freeware) use that for boot defrag, MFT, pagefile and system. Set to once every first boot4. Slimcleaner or Cloud System Booster (both freeware) or ToolWiz Care freewareDo 1 thru 4 and that laptop will be quicker.", "Date": "August 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent laptop for the money $250.00 at Target", "Author": "Mark Lawson", "ReviewID": "R342LQFIDJJR69", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to say this is a great little laptop for the low price of 249.99 at Target and with the \"red card\" they took an additional 5% off.I can't say enough good about it for the money.It has 4GB of DDR3 Dual Channel memory for fast everything!A 1.7Ghz Dual Core processor is plenty fast enough for everything i do daily on this laptop.Youtube videos are crystal clear and in HD thanks to the Intel HD card with 128 of dedicated memory and up to 1700 shared.It has a very good webcam with built in microphone and is very clear on Skype.For what i paid i am extremely happy to have this as an \"everyday use\" system.I have owned about every brand of laptop from low end to high end and this one, well, i have no complaints.", "Date": "August 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "gateway", "Author": "Bryce Sowers", "ReviewID": "R8S1JUNL62Z0D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did not buy this on amazon but i will give you an idea of this computer.

The computer could not boot after restore at all, I called again another person said that I have to reset the computer to factory default or send it to them to reset it and I have to agree that I will lose data. I chose to do it myself and at least save my time, following his instructions the computer was back to its original factory default, and my keys are still not working, I could not connect to internet because some password items were among those non functioning keys. I called again they said I have to send it to them on my own expense but they will send it back to me on their expense, after one week of waiting they called me saying the computer is on hold for $199 because after opening it they found fluid residue and that is not covered under warranty. I refused to pay, I thought it is not worth it to pay $199 to fix a $340 computer.I would rather go for a new tablet. They send it 2 days later by FedEx in the exact same condition it was . End results I lost my data, I lost my time, I lost my money and I have a useless piece of electronics.Plus I don`t recall any fluid spells at all. Please think twice before dealing with this product.

Few days ago, lap top mouse started overheating and would not click. I had to use optical mouse to work. I did not wanted to deal with it, and also I do not know what other possible troubles may occur so I returned it.

The price is great $250 but I will be exchanging it for a diffrent brand. This laptop is nice but is REALLY SLOW speacially on you tube. My old laptop is 7 years old window XP and I can watch videos faster on it. Also the speakers are VERY WEAK. You couldn't use to play music for the whole room.

Stumbled on the deal and jumped on it considering it had HDMI and a web cam so she can skype and plug easily into our large tv.Web cam is dead on first start-up. Hardware is not detected at all, so there's obviously a hardware issue. Now farther along on our trip, there's no Target anywhere near to return it. Call Gateway and the \"support\" is laughable. I can't understand ANYTHING they say at first until we convince them to talk slower. Bad phone connection to halfway around the world didn't help either. They suggested updating the drivers- except that doesn't work when the hardware is not detected. They don't have a script to deal with that problem, though. They offered a Target gift card in exchange if I drive 834 miles back to where we got it. Bad deal only getting a gift card when we paid REAL money for this thing and had no desire to spend any more with Target.Towards the end of the call, we simply asked for the guy's name and he went off on us. He said we don't listen and now we would get him fired. Touchy little guy... maybe things are really tough wherever it is he lives.So far, we've had it a week and haven't used it. Don't really care to mail it in and wait 3 weeks for them to replace it with a used one. They also said on the second phone call that this computer was registered to someone else- although the packaging was factory sealed. Not a good sign. So, we will drive to another Target which is well over an hour drive to return it. We won't be leaving without our money- not a gift card. Both Target and Gateway/Acer have blown it. All we were asking for is to be able to exchange it for a new one and I even offered to pay the shipping or front the money for the replacement and they could credit me back when they receive our defective one. They simply won't do anything other than insult us and offer a used/refurb to replace our NEW computer.You get what you pay for- I'm typing this on a Dell XPS... my fifth one, and when the time comes there will be a sixth. Never any issues, I just get a new one every year or so to keep up with the latest gizmos.", "Date": "August 9, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B008NZT42Y"}}
