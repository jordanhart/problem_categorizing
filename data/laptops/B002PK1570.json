It runs great.  The only issue I had trouble with was the face recognition for login; the light always seemed too low for it to work properly and it would just churn forever.  I disabled that (uninstalled it) and it's been running fine ever since.  Plenty of speed and power for what I use it for -- Internet browsing, light games, word processing, spreadsheets.  Movies play great, display is great.", "Date": "May 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "First laptop ended in bad condition", "Author": "Bajji, India", "ReviewID": "RJ1B149G1367J", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is the first laptop i'm buying..CD Drive worked only one day..Now it s not working..Dont know how other laptops in lenovo...Totally i'm not saisfied with the product..", "Date": "February 18, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002PK1570"}}
