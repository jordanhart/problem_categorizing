DELL INSPIRON IS NOW AVAILABLE IN WIN 8.1 WITH SUPPORT AVAILABLE! :)+++++++++++++++++++++++++DISPLAY:15.6 inch High Definition Widescreen Touch-Display; Surface is glass. Includes built-in Web Cam.INCLUDES:A/C Adapter and cordLithium Cell BatteryPERFORMANCE:NOTE: Series depends on what MONTH your Model was built! Mine was built in January 2014 so it is the LATEST versionIntel Core i5 -3337U Processor; 1.8 GHz, 3 MB cacheNOTE: ALL DELLS comes with 6 GB Memory - only very high ends may come with 8 GB Memory this is for your information - I upgraded mine to 32 Memory; so it is worth the investment to upgrade the memory!WARNING!These Series can either come with a 500 HDD (Hard Drive) or 1 TB (Terabyte) HDD <-- pay attention!They MAY or MAY NOT include SSD (Solid State Drive) which can range from 64 SSD up to 128 SSD!ATTENTION!Majority of them comes with:Intel High Definition Integrated GraphicsBUT ... there are some out there that comes with NVIDIA GRAPHICS  <--- please pay close attention (NVIDIA GRAPHICS is actually better than Intel HD Integrated Graphics but they are hard to come by)PHOTO: SEE THE BASIC SET UP WITHOUT THE MOUNTED MODE AND JUST RUNNING ON SINGLE SLOT (THEY COME WITH 2 MEMORY SLOTS) AND YET THE PERFORMANCE IS EXCEPTIONAL.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++SOFTWARE:GOOD NEWS - DELL HAS ELIMINATED JUNK!Some may or may not get Cyberlink (Depending on what month your ultrabook was built; older ones would have this, newer ones would not)Pretty much all Dells would have some type of version of McAfee <--- Microsoft does not recommend this, you can uninstall this and use Windows Defender as it is updated and use the Tech Website and run the free McAfee Stinger once in awhile if you so desire; but McAfee actually drains your resources out.DELL's Services and Software <--- For Windows 7; much of this is required, for Windows 8, some are not compatible; if you have Windows 8 you will be able to go to My Dell and see it in there in the updated  downloads of what is there available and there you would know which ones can be uninstalled out of your device safely or speak to the Tech (but most likely they are going to tell you not to uninstall it but since it is NOT compatible with Windows 8 it makes no sense why Dell's Tech Support would tell you not to uninstall something that does not run or work with Windows 8 if you think about it... makes no sense here; go ahead and uninstall it and update everything that you need from either the auto updater (if your model was built older, you might have to go to Dell Downloads and download and update to get caught up to date manually and from there everything will work in synchronization after wards).WARNING!  THIS IS A BASIC WINDOWS 8 OPERATING SYSTEM, AND YOU CAN UPGRADE TO A BASIC WINDOWS 8.1 ONLY; DELL DOES NOT PROVIDE TECH SUPPORT FOR WINDOWS 8 PRO OR 8.1 PRO; THEY WILL ONLY ADVISE YOU TO GO TO MICROSOFT ... HOWEVER, IN THEIR UPDATING SYSTEM (AUTO UPDATER) IT STAYS IN SYNCHRONIZATION WITH MICROSOFT WINDOWS UPDATE SO THERE ARE NO ISSUES WITH UPDATING WITH MICROSOFT WINDOWS 8 PRO OR 8.1 PRO.PHOTO 2: SEE THE DELL'S \"MY DELL\" (my personal info has been wiped out) - you will want to leave this running regardless of what DELL Operating System you are using Win 8 (Basic), 8.1 (Basic) or upgraded to Win 8 Pro or Win 8.1 Pro; while Microsoft(TM) Windows update pretty much updates drivers including Intel; but it does not update everything so \"MY DELL\" covers the remainder.+++++++++++++++++++++++INCLUDES:ATTENTION:  Some models have more than others even though they are in the same series; pay close attention here!Standard: CD/DVD/RW Drive  / UPGRADED: CD/DVD/RW/BE (Blu-Ray) Drive <-- pay close attention to the two - and no, these models do no have Laserscribe or Laser writing Rom Drives.Wireless - B/G or B/G/N <-- pay close attention to which version if you are using this both WAN and LAN mode if you have Upgraded to Windows 8 or 8.1 Pro - you will be upgraded to B/G/N  Wireless; both including high speed plus Blue Tooth; Windows 8 or 8.1 Pro will have higher speed which is better than the Windows 8 Basic or Windows 8.1 Basic.Media Card Reader (Micro)HDMI - can tolerate standard and high speedWARNING! This series is tricky, depending on month this was built, the older months have 2.0 only; then mid-months have split 2.0 and 3.0; the newer models are 2.0/3.0 (backwards compatibility) on all 4 ports.WARNING! Old models had headset port in front where Micro Card Reader was located, mid-month and newer has moved the location to the left side of the port; the older models are NOT High Definition; the mid-month and thereon are HD and you can use Speech Recognition as well.ATTENTION:  Blue Led Lights - Standard: would have four;  those built up may have additional front panel lights. These Blue lights are a nice soft glow and not harsh at all; but on the Moon Silver, it is difficult to read the icons so it pays to memorize the led light arrangements.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Synaptic Pad as it's been known as or Touch Pad; is still there; by default when you start it is turned on; but after you have started the DELL by default it becomes disabled until you configure it.USB Port: Right or Left side - you can still use your mouse and configure itTouch Screen: You can configure itNOTE!  This does take time setting everything up and if you have a private network or in home network, it is a good idea to plug in your Dell Ultra Laptop and connect to the Ethernet; it does help speed up on the downloads and get the WIFI to the Private network, especially if you run on a \"hidden SSID\" type networking.++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++What I have is a 500 GB HDD but that does not matter because I prefer to usage of the portable USB HDD, which I know how to mount drives and configure it; which it supersedes the 1 TB HDD even if I had it; I would not use 1 TB HDD; for I have found out they only run at 54000 RPM  so those mounted drives makes it really fast.+++++++++++++++++++++The weight they tell you is a misnomer, it is very light; so a slight shift if it were on your lap or something can easily topple this over. What I use is the old notebook stand (it is huge) from years ago when notebooks were big, heavy and bulky; a neighbor was going to throw it away and I asked for it, and glued it together. It does have additional ports in back; I use velvet and rubber stickers and put them on the stand, as not to scratch the DELL up and yet the rubber keeps it from sliding around. The bonus here is the ability to mount on to the other port, the 3 TB EXHDD (External Hard Drive) if I have to use it - so that adds up more virtual and hyper-V (aka Hyper Visor) and this Dell Ultra book doesn't go fast ... it flies!+++++++++++++++++++RECOMMENDED PURCHASES:Memory Sticks - to add to the Dell; I have DDR3 Corsair - 11-11-11-30; there are only 2 slots (NOTE: I have had these Memory Cards or Sticks for a long time so finding these might be difficult for you; I have seen some Brand Names on Amazon going around for 10-10-10-28 which is not bad at all; but they go fast! Well worth the money invested!) AMAZON HAS MANY MEMORY FOR LAPTOPS AVAILABLE FOR YOU!I have uploaded the photo to show proof - without the MOUNTED DRIVES installed on the USB ports; just to show you how impressive this is.On the reading of the Dell Scoring on the Intel Integrated Graphics (4000 HD) on Windows 8.1 Pro is at 8.7 the highest (the highest one can go is 9.9) and the lowest score was 7.2 with the mounted drives all set up.Recommended at least 2 of 1 TB each (SLIM) USB High Speed 2.0/3.0  EXHDD and configure them to VHD (Virtual Hard Drive) and mount them to the 500 GB or 1 TB HDD on your Dell; it makes a tremendous difference and takes a huge load off your Operating System and the Hard Drive itself.Mandatory Purchase ----> Jeweler's Cloth or Eye Glasses Cloth - you do not want to use chemicals or towels to clean your Touch Screen; you are better off using one of the above to clean the screen of your Touch Screen. These are are very important investment. You might want to consider looking around at Thrift Stores, maybe a child's dress or outfit, just for the velvet or if you get lucky to find genuine fur cheap - snatch it; because fur and velvet will not scratch glass and thin enough to close your Dell Ultrabook after shutting down and putting away.Optional Recommended Purchase:  Microsoft (TM) Notebook Bag - comes in array of colors and I have already written up a rave review on this as well as a video review of a bad laptop that is history now for this is a replacement for the one that is \"garbage\"' but the Microsoft (TM) Bag is waterproof, well padded, able to store your cord, Slim EXHDD's, Mouse, and other accessories including your cell phone, pen, paper, includes two mesh bags on side to put your favorite water bottle or coffee thermos to go; easy to carry as a backpack or travel. Holds a lot yet very light weight; whether for business, travel, hospital, or on the go. Stylish and Trendy just perfect for your Stylish and Sleek Dell Inspiron!******3/3/201464 GB Micro-Memory Card Reader Purchased on Amazon - good for back ups; saving your vault info and for flash; very hard to find specs on these Micro-Memory Card Readers due to \"vague\" specs. Found one that Dell had recommended and will give this one a shot as it is compatible with Win 8 or 8.1 Pro (Class 10 Micro-Memory Card Reader).******UPDATED ANNOUNCEMENT:DELL HAS NOW MADE IT AVAILABLE - you have the option to purchase a Win 8.1 Pro upgrade from Dell or from Microsoft (including Brick and Mortar Stores) OEM DVD version; all upgrades and updates are available on MY DELL NOW!+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++NOTICE ALERT!YOU HAVE TO PURCHASE A MICROSOFT WINDOWS 8 OR 8.1 PRO EITHER A DVD OR DOWNLOAD VERSION FROM MICROSOFTEXAMPLE FROM AMAZON and install the upgrade yourself from Windows 8 and after you've upgraded to 8.1, then either the downloaded version or DVD version (Available are 1 PC, 3 PC and those who wants a OEM KEY (Business) must go through Microsoft themselves to purchase such like with their other OEM Products) - I would recommend than you get the DVD OEM from Microsoft rather than the download version just in case something goes wrong and your unit had to be service and you find out your have to reinstall this, you can through your Microsoft Account and through commerce(dot)microsoft(fot)com and making sure you are logged in. and they will help you get you get your Dell back on your feet (same with any Microsoft Products).Windows 8.1 Pro - complete package (FQC-06913) -", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "My do it all computer", "Author": "Peter Pirando", "ReviewID": "R3CEBRP8661ENR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use this computer as my primary, basically a desktop replacement, and lemme tell you; this computer fast, silent, run undemanding games really well...

I saw at Sams club for $100 more, and Amazon had the free shipping with Prime.  So far, I love. love, love this laptop.  Its perfect.  No backlight keyboard but really don't need that for me.  Fast and has a nice look to it.  This time bought the 3 years accidents and spills warranty which I should have for the Asusis.  Dell is really nice.

It was NOT a new computer as Dell confirmed it had already been registered to someone else.  It also had the wrong operating system Microsoft 8.0 vs. 8.1.  There was no instruction manual with it.  Also, the notification that I was going to receive a credit said the reason for return was that \"the item was shipped late.\"  Not true.  Is some doctoring their data bases to show that the reason for return was for a different reason?
