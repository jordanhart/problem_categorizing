I paid particular attention to those with driver problems.  I decided it was good value and that I'd take the risk of dealing with any potential driver problems.  After receiving the netbook and doing the initial sign-on and setup, the first thing that I then did was start the HP Support Assistant, selected 'Updates & tune-ups' and applied all updates before proceeding.  Only then did I apply all the windows updates via the normal windows updates. All updates went on fine without any problems.  It was only then that I proceeded to install any other software.  I've had no driver problems or network issues what-so-ever.  All my favorite programs work just fine.  This is a nice little netbook and I'd recommend it.  The only issues I had any trouble with was setting up the T-Mobile access.  I was unable to register online because the online registration process requires a phone number associated with the SIM card.  This was fixed by calling T-Mobile and getting a phone number assigned to the SIM.  The only other problem was then setting up an online account with T-Mobile.  To setup this account requires that a temporary password be sent, via a text message, to the SIM.  This process assumes that you're setting up a phone, not a netbook or PC.  There was no way to receive this message on the netbook.  According to T-Mobile support the only way to get this password was via this text message.  They recommended that I remove the SIM and put it in an unlocked phone or take it down to a local T-Mobile store have them do that for me.  Fortunately, I had an older unlocked phone that accepted the SIM and I was able to text the password that way.  Other than that everything setup just fine.  The performance is good for such a little machine.  I purchased this mostly for when I travel.  Now I'm retired so I only travel for pleasure not business.  While actually traveling I mostly use it as an entertainment device, mostly playing games and watching videos.  However, I also use it for other functions, like tracking my finances via Quicken, which it also performs very well.  Battery life is good, not great, but more than adequate.  This netbook performs very well in this capacity.  So don't believe all those negative reviews concerning the drivers.  You just need to make sure you update everything first, starting with the HP drivers via the Support Assistant.", "Date": "January 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop, buggy drivers", "Author": "Noble", "ReviewID": "R35B9W22E047A2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was just about ready to send this one back, but decided to give it one more shot with HP tech support.  I normally shun tech support these days because of the severe offshore-ness that has infested support centers these days. However, I liked the cellular broadband capabilities of this unit and nothing else on the current market fits my requirements as this one does.  The fellow in India I got connected with turned out to be an extremely knowledgeable chap with fine language skills.  What it appears is that HP sent these little buggers out with terribly immature drivers for the cellular broadband networking and the support software loaded on this machine was also seriously deficient. It took the better part of an hour to get these items corrected, but the end result is a laptop that now functions as it should and fits the bill for me superbly.

However, I found out that you can install the graphics driver without any problems. Another driver you might want is the Wi-fi card driver, but it will cause your computer to have startup problems. A work around is to connect to the Internet using the included T-mobile SIM card or using an Ethernet cable. After you're connected, go to Device Manager and you'll find an exclamation mark next to your network driver. Right click on it and choose \"update driver.\" And then let it search automatically online and it'll find the driver and install it.

Very light and will fit in any of bags with no issue. Its looks like the cover will get marked up, might want to get a skin for it.Screen resolution is great, and bright enough to use in the dark even thought the keyboard isn't back lit. I haven't tried the webcam so I'm not sure how that is. The audio is one of the main reasons I bought this and with my weaker headphones on I listened to some music and it came in great, sometimes on my older comp, I'd have the volume up, but I don't recommend that with these. I like my music loud but this turned all the way up is a big much. It is supposed to have a great fan on the inside but I have been a little worried because I use it in bed and it seems to get a little hot on the bottom. Its not bad and I'm sure if you used it just on your lap it would be fine.Window 8 takes time to get used to, I still down't even have it down and I've been playing around with it each night. There are some apps that can teach you shortcuts, and if you can get to the internet, there are guides out there to help you. If you have Gmail the app looks like it works for that but I don't think it does for yahoo. You can still have a desktop and add a few apps to that, but what I found out is that calculator isn't built in so that is bothersome, having to change between screens rather than just being able to bring it up in a few clicks.Great laptop, but like I said gotta be willing to learn to use windows 8.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP!", "Author": "Deirdre Simmons \"DMS\"", "ReviewID": "R3957NN6GNHQVC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i've had this computer for about year.

T-mobile stated taht promotional was only for units sold directly from HP or Target.

The hardware on this computer is fine, but after starting it for the first time I realized what a terrible mistake I had made buying a Windows 8 computer.  Microsoft got it right with XP and Windows 7, but Windows 8 is just wrong, in so many ways there isn't enough space to go into it here.  It would have been far better for me if this computer had come loaded with Vista.
