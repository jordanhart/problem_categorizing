At first I thought I would not like window's 8, but I just love it, it's very easy window application, and it's nice that you can go back and forth to any application that you have opened. Samsung gives you more for there software too, a friend of mine bought a laptop (another brand with windows 8) and it didn't have as much software on it that this Samsung does, and my friends laptop was more expansive. I also like the Samsung applications it comes with, most of them are free, and you can go to the Samsung store app and download more. I won't get into the technical parts of this laptop, because it's easy to use, and there's a guide (manuel) that come with it. All in all I would buy another one as a gift for a family member. I give this product a 5 star.......", "Date": "May 10, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0098O6DLY"}}
