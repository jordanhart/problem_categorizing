It stays relatively cool when in use and lasts quite a while on the battery supplied (I get about 4+ hours when word processing and browsing the web).  I have a slightly different model.  I have an E420 1141-A51.  This machine is not for gaming.  I have had problems with the video card drivers.  Games and some video processes have caused the system to freeze or blue screen.  After resolving these issues, I steer clear of these kinds of applications.", "Date": "July 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Dublin", "ReviewID": "RQNCRODARAL5E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As it was my first time to buy a laptop via internet, I was little nervous.
