It's fast, stays cool, is easy to use, and I never have issues with it. I love the 3.0 usb ports, allows for faster transfers. It doesn't have that cheap feel that some laptops have. I don't really have anything bad to say about it. I guess the only thing is that the keys are a bit smaller compared to other laptops, but you get used to it. Great laptop overall at a fair price.", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good and good for the money", "Author": "Hardy J.

Be advised these seemed highly modified and, when pricing, make sure you are doing apples to apples.

Within 1 week of buying I see that the keys on the keyboard stops working.  You will hit a J and it thinks you are trying to do F2 or screen swap.  The only way to get out of this is to log off and log back in.  The hot keys at the top of the keyboard are swapped.  So F5 does not do refresh.  I have never been able to successfully connect wirelessly with my printer.  Now after about 2 years, entire folders disappear.  What do I mean by that?  Well you can go to Windows Explorer (file manager) and you can go to your My documents folders and you can see your \"Kids\" folder (as an example) but if you write a word document and then go to save it, the \"kids\" folder within your My documents folder cannot be seen.  So what I have to do is save it to my desktop and then move it manually to the kids folder.  This also means that for the most part if I want to send an email with an attachment I need to save to the file to my desktop to ensure I will be able to find the file to attach to the email for sending.  I bought this laptop brand new and before this I had a Compaq Presario CQ60 that went bad a few short years after buying brand new.  I am really starting to think I should avoid all HP laptops all together.", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00BPYSOL2"}}
