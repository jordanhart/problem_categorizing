{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Incredible PC, Glad I waited for it to come out.", "Author": "Nicholas R", "ReviewID": "RV5GSJYNPSS9E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I pre-ordered the HP Envy X2 from HP Direct. I have purchased lot of DM4's for most of our sales staff and been happy with the quality, performance and price. I was concerned about the crazy things going on at HP lately. I wanted an ultrabook for travel but I didn't like the early versions that HP had come out with. I was researching the Asus and Lenovo but nothing ever struck me to buy. Then, I read about the upcoming X2 Hybrid. This thing is everything I wanted: small, fantastic battery life, snappy performance, and touch screen. It came in earlier than expected so I was able to take it with me on a business trip. It's good that it did, because I had time on the plane to learn how to navigate in Windows 8. I highly recommend using the \"Getting Started\" tutorial and the \"Windows 8 Cheats Keys\" Apps. It got me up to speed and now I see where Microsoft was headed with this. Back to the Envy, this is by far the nicest product I have every purchased from HP. It is truly incredible. The construction is beautiful, and it doesn't even get hot on your lap. AGAIN, the battery life is INSANE because you get a battery in the tablet and the base. In the first day, I literally had 4 different people ask about it when they would see me use the touch screen on a laptop. It was hilarious when I would show how the screen detaches into a tablet, lots of WOW and OOOH! I used it for an entire 3 hour flight and only ate up 15% of the total battery. You do the math ... that is awesome.Regardless of just the cool factor, this thing is a great multifunctional tool. I have all the features of an iPad, but the power of a business PC. Most of the apps I use like Evernote, Netflix, Skype, Shazam, Youtube, Facebook etc are already in the App Store. One bummer is that I'd really like to have my banking App too. I'm sure the number of apps will grow rapidly. I loaded MS Office and even a CAD reader to view 3D renderings. It works flawlessly.Any review that doesn't glow about this thing must be a bipolar Apple/Mac user.", "Date": "December 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Almost Perfect", "Author": "W. Dunlap \"HighTechGuru\"", "ReviewID": "R3459JZAMAS3AJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had my Envy X2 since it was released in December. I purchased it directly from HP. It is a beautifully designed laptop/tablet hybrid with only a few issues, most of which are not in anyway the product of HP or its design team.The size and weight of the computer are perfect for traveling with the computer. The hinge release design and overall build quality far exceeds those of comparable products (Asus and Samsung ATIV).  IT has two usb slots, an HDMI connection, and a SD card reader built into the keyboard dock. The tablet has a Micro SD card reader that will increase the overall storage up to 64GB. This is an excellent feature given the unit comes with only 64GB and over half of it is taken up by Windows and the recovery partition. The keyboard dock also houses a separate battery and separate CPU, so when the tablet is docked, the battery and CPU in the keyboard power the unit.  When it is not docked, it runs off the battery and CPU in the tablet casing itself. Overall sound quality is decent, but nothing to write home about. It lacks bass completely.The Intel atom chip is a vast improvement over the prior chip that bared its name and was found in almost every netbook previously. The processor will allow you to run multiple apps and is responsive in basic programs such as Office. It is not a gaming system and it will not give you the performance required to run most major games.  Also, the graphics chip is the Intel chip based on the Power VR design (arm design) so it does not support Direct X, which is another reason this machine is not meant for gaming. For business use and school use, this machine is ideally suited.The wireless chip is a major design flaw, albeit an Intel one.  The nature of the Atom chip is a SOC (sytem on a chip design). It is this design that allows for the 14 plus hour battery life on this system.  To accomplish this all of the components are built in to system chip and the chip regulates power usage to a minimum. As a result, the wireless card is not capable of handling speeds over 65mbps. Despite being a wireless N design, it will never come close to 300 mbps of wireless N.  It is a single antenna design, despite its multiband capability. It is designed this way to maximize power. However, since the computer does not have an Ethernet connection, this is some what of a drawback if you have a high speed internet connection or need to move large amounts of data over a wireless network.  My Fios connection is 75 down and 35 up and I cannot achieve my maximum speed on this device. This feature is shared on all Intel Atom designs, including the Samsung ATIV 500 and the Asus equivalent. The manufacturers conveniently leave this fact out of their spec sheets and websites. It is a trade off for the battery life, but it something that prospective buyers should aware of when looking at this system.The memory is sufficent for most everyday apps and it will allow multiple programs to be open in the background, as long as the programs are not memory intensive, such as Photoshop or video editing.The Touchpad has some issues as well, and hopefully a fix will come via a driver update in the future. It will stop responding for no apparent reason, especially if the computer is left sitting for awhile.The only other drawback is the stylus. At this point it still has not been released, and HP does not have a release date. This is one of the major reasons I purchased the computer.  Also, according to the manual, the stylus is an Atmel stylus instead of WACOM. This means that you will only get 512 levels of pressure at most and it could be as little as 256. This will limit the stylus to basic handwriting and editing tasks. If you are looking to do graphic design or heavy photo retouching, this is not the stylus based computer for you.Overall, this is an excellent system for the money and it will allow you to run legacy windows programs in addition to Windows RT software from the app store.  It is apparent that HP put some real thought and design into the system. The fact that the system comes with the keyboard dock is also an added plus to help justify the slightly higher cost.  The overall build quality is far superior to the Samsung ATIV and ASUS, both of which are made of plastic components.As long as you know that this is not a powerhouse computer for gaming or heavy photo and video editing, you can't go wrong with this computer.", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Ultrabook", "Author": "John R.

I have full access to all my windows applications and a growing table app marketplace to support the tablet environment.About the hardware: Snappy performance, very light-weight.  Expandable (Micro and standard Secure Digital card slots); 1 on the tablet and one on the base.  Extremely long battery life (2 batteries).  The screen resolution is very good and clear from a wide range of angles.  Let's be clear, this is no retina display, but it is a high resolution In-Plane Switching panel.The tablet is extremely light and comfortable in  my hands.  The volume and power buttons are easily accessible and in the right spots. The \"detach\" mechanism for the tablet and base is intuitive and easy thanks to the integrated guide magnets.The Beats audio sounds great and requires no intervention.Out of the box:Out of the box the unit was charged and ready for use.  Windows 8 setup was quick and easy, however there were many updates that needed to be downloaded for the OS and pre-installed apps.Minor issue:Camera- I'd like to see better camera/video appsMetro Interface- Some things still seem to work better with a keyboard/mouse rather than a touch interface.

It turns off whenever it wants and now refuses to even turn back on. Tried doing the Windows update.. Didnt work.  don't waste your money on this junkUPDATE-months laterI thought I would give this laptop a try and work within its limitations but boy I was wrong. This is really not a good product I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE! At first it was freezing sporadically, now I can barely have it run Word to work on school stuff even worse try to go online and do research. It is more frustrating than it is worth. The audio is the same, barely audible which to me is a huge problem. I would return it if I was still within the time to do so, unfortunately now I am stuck with it.----------------------------------------------------------------------------Original post-Ok, to clarify I really like this computer. It has a lot of great assets to it but the cons sometimes drive me nuts! The audio.. is terrible! for someone who likes to listen to music often I don't appreciate having to be in an absolutely quiet environment to be able to hear the audio so for me that is a big con! Also, the computer seems to freeze once in a while and you can't do anything about it aside from restarting it. I read that from other reviews but thought it would only happen if you have too many things on at the same time.. nope it happens either way whenever it wants. The last con is that because it is a convertible laptop most of the weight is on the screen so if you are trying to type with the computer on your lap it tends to topple back, it bothers me because that is how I mostly type lol. I did not experience the difficulties that other reviews mentioned with the keyboard. In terms of things I like of the computer, mostly how fast it restarts! it is soooo fast! with other computers it takes about a minute or two to turn on, this one is up and running in seconds! the convertible aspect of it is great as well very sleek and elegant. so overall I like the computer, I plan on using it as an auxiliary portable laptop not for my more heavy video editing, watching movies etc. Very basic needs.", "Date": "June 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful!!", "Author": "Park Lady", "ReviewID": "R19CJQ9DNLJK4E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This notebook/tablet is great.

You used to be a good brand.", "Author": "Mark Bolgiano \"Data Scientist\"", "ReviewID": "RQNUMDKMGKARL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have been in IT management for 25 years.  I've bought a LOT of HP printers, laptops, desktops, and servers.  I've always been pleased with the quality of the product, and the level of customer service.  That is, until I bought this sorry excuse for a tablet notebook PC.I bought this direct from HP 11 months ago as my personal machine.  It sounded great - and I confidently bought it, trusting the HP brand.  What a mistake that turned out to be.  I'm so disappointed!This isn't a rant - I'll make it short. Basically, the machine is (a) semi-functional at best as a laptop OR tablet, and (b) did not match the published spec, particularly with the absence of the advertised digitizer pen/stylus...From day one, the Envy X2 was lagging terribly and freezing constantly, for long periods of time, even lagging on a single open window (Excel or Word or Outlook, for example - or IE) in Windows 8 desktop.  It's only got 2GB memory (and no option to improve it), and no matter how much I tried to manage it (seriously cramping my work style in the process) it became abundantly clear that it simply  was under-powered for anything but browser apps (which could still get pokey at times) and.. I don't know... DOS?But arguably, I knew it had 2GB when I bought it, so I'm willing to concede that the most I can complain about is how either HP or Windows 8 manages that memory.  It's pretty pathetic, though - even for 2GB.Regardless, the truly heinous and dishonest outrage by HP is that it advertised it with a digitizer stylus.  I love OneNote and this was THE differentiating feature that determined my selection of the Envy X2.  I bought it directly from HP - and it didn't ship with a stylus.  I called HP to point this out, and they said you had to buy the optional stylus.  OK, I thought.  Searched the web.  No stylus was offered that was compatible with the Envy X2- by HP or a 3rd party.  Hmmmm.  Called HP again. Oh yeah, said HP.  Now we remember.  We're having a little trouble with the stylus thing, but it will be available in the near future.  We're very sorry for the inconvenience.  Six months later, still no stylus, and now, all mentions and pictures of the stylus have been mysteriously removed from specs and marketing documents.  Speculation on customer sites about maybe one of the other HP digitizer stylii will work on the Envy X2.  But each time, some brave person throwing good money after bad reports - no joy, it doesn't work with the X2.I call HP again, a little perturbed now.  They've been talking out of their... hats or something, just jerking me around.  But it got worse at this point - from naughty fibs to bald-faced, contrived, intelligence-insulting big lies.  \"What we MEANT was that you could use the generic rubber-tipped pens on the screen.\"REALLY?I bought a new model machine because, frankly, I trusted the HP brand.  And I admit it.  They got me.  I've been snookered out of a lot of money.But, I'm a reasonable person, and while supremely screwing up this model, snookering me into buying it with false advertising on a key feature, and then feeding me BS for months to cover that up DOES give my trust in HP a serious black eye, it won't kill it.  We all screw up every once in a while... I am really wishing and hoping that this is just a fluke for HP.But if HP won't give me a refund, or a machine that is equipped and operates with the specs I bought on, as advertised, that trust is as dead as a door-nail, never to show it's ugly face again. I'll be looking for HP's successor in my circle of trust.As nice as this machine sounds, don't buy it.  You'll be looking for another within the year as I am.", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Gift for my daughter.", "Author": "H.

But I feel that I must share my knowledge about this product with potential buyers and hopefully the HP engineering department.The laptop/tablet is amazing for what it is. It is not the fastest processor or the highest screen resolution for the tech geeks out there. If you need a windows platform to work from it has a well rounded set of features that allows you to work with a \"windows tablet\" when un-docked from the keyboard that is very responsive, light weight with amazing battery life. When coupled with the keyboard with a simple click engagement there is the added convenience of a full keyboard with a full featured touch-pad plus additional battery life that comes from the secondary battery in the keyboard dock.That is where the problem lives, the marriage of the two. When the two combine to make one unit and the system is shut down there is a major battery drain. When the laptop is turned off the battery from the keyboard will try to keep the tablet charged and it will drain the entire system within 12-24 hours. If yo go to HP.com, support, Consumer Support Forum and enter \"Envy x2 battery drain\" in the search you will find a 12 page thread dealing with this.

If you're worried about learning the new Windows 8 interface, stop worrying. It takes about an hour to learn the swipes and then it's easier to use than an iPAD. I picked up the HP tablet about a week ago and sold my iPAD 48 hours later.Throughout Microsoft's history, they haven't been first to market. They run behind, but technology isn't just a race. Microsoft works best at improving on the ideas others bring to market. Windows 8 is evolution. We're not going back to the mouse and keyboard just because computers evolved from an IBM typewriter.The HP Envy X2 makes the iPAD look like steampunk technology. Apple makes great hardware, but Microsoft is better with software. And HP successfully blends the two. Remember the three bears, iPAD, Surface, and Envy. The HP Envy is just right. A light laptop with a great keyboard and trackpad. An easily readable display for anyone whose eyesight isn't at least 20/20. Two batteries for all-day use. Slots for up to 192 gigabytes of SD card storage in addition to the 64GB SSD. And a snappy processor that runs all my Windows software almost as fast as my quad core PC.And for less adventurous users, you can still run all your apps with your mouse, trackpad and keyboard on the Windows desktop. Windows 8 is a stunning leap forward, but I remember when the folks at IBM were saying serious users will never adapt to mice. Soon everyone will be swiping and touching instead of pointing and clicking.What's the downside?

I re-purchased it again sometime in March because Staples had an amazing deal, and I wanted to give it another try. Granted, I did extensive research prior to purchasing it. I was torn between the X2 and Surface PRO, because they both encompassed everything I've dreamed of for my next laptop: touchscreen; lightweight, sleek and slim design; detachable/hide-away keyboard; I wanted a tablet with the power of a laptop!But it was too good to be true. I was sorely disappointed and dismayed once again, primarily because Windows 8 caused me a great deal of frustration and angst. I felt very limited by Win8, and was at times near tears because I couldn't bypass Win8, even when I used Win7 mode. And I do consider myself technologically savvy. I can pretty much troubleshoot and figure things out myself by playing around. I previously owned a Dell Inspiron 1500 ($1,080) for 4 years, followed by a HP Pavillion dv2-1030us ($600) I purchased in 2009, so I take good care of and keep my laptops for an average of 4 years. And both laptops started having issues near the end of the 4 year period.However, I'm already getting fed up with the X2 just two months in, because it freezes and crashes way too often, sometimes multiple times per day or session. The \"s\" key sometimes gets stuck for no apparent reason. (Mind you, I take good care of my electronic items.) And sometimes the cursor goes crazy and activates Win8 when I'm in Win7 mode. And just today, in the middle of transferring files from a flashdrive, the laptop stops reading it. I tried refreshing and even restarting the laptop, only for it to happen again. I ran virus scans, thinking I have a virus, but nothing came up.My last resort for maintaining my sanity was to come to these review boards to see if others are as exasperated as I am, and to see if there are any suggestions or fixes out there for these glitches. I do want to keep this laptop. In fact, I want to love it, because it is a great concept, but not at the price of my sanity.
