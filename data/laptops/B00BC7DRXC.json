{"Reviews": [{"Title": "review after a week", "Author": "V. Sharma", "ReviewID": "R97PSSIHV57VC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Here are my comments about a few things I noticed. Hopefully these will be useful to other people in making a decision.Likes-----Price, lightweight, looks like a Macbook Air, matte screen, feels metallic solid, backlit keyboard, speakers, motherboard quality (I hope it lasts long, I read that ASUS is famous for its motherboards; my previous ThinkPad motherboard failed after about 2 years of use)fan noise - barely audible at any time, had to bring the laptop close to the ear to hear it running.Temperature - gets barely hot at the bottom even after many hours of use, heat dissipation is very efficient with all metallic surfacesNeutral-------keyboard - I don't like chiclet style keyboards, not really good for typing. My previous Thinkpad had an awesome keyboard.processor - core i3, kind of slow, but I knew it while buying, guess that's why it's cheaper.SSD - does not boot any faster. It's as if the laptop has a regular spinning HD.Battery - I'm getting ~ 3-4 hours with regular use.Wireless - no problem so far, connects immediately upon booting/waking up.Dislikes--------Mousepad - the worst thing in this ultrabook is the mousepad. It's enormous in size (there was really no need!) and because of that my hands keep touching it and making mistakes all the time while typing. I am getting used to typing with my wrists slightly lifted off of the surface. Moreover, mousepad is very sensitive to touch, I am not sure if there is any setting which can be changed to make it less sensitive, will look around. Also I miss the dedicated left/right click buttons. I had them in my previous Dell and ThinkPad laptops and found them useful for navigation.", "Date": "September 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Asus UX32A", "Author": "LoveJoyPeace", "ReviewID": "R1S2JDRBL99XZD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:  - Quick, but not lightning speed  - Amazing design, weighing in around 3 pounds  - Back-light keyboard and its spacing  - Ideal for school, or everyday use  - 3 usb ports  - Comes w/ USB to Ethernet & Mirco USBto HDMI cable.Cons:  - Battery life is average  - Fan is on the bottom, but rarely gets hot  - Loaded with bloatware  - Fan is not completely silent, but is not distracting  - No DVD/CD player, not a deal-breaker however  - Trackpad is unnecessarily largeFor the most part, I believe this laptop is a great run for its money. I am very impressed with its design, and is ideal for me since I do not plan on doing graphic design or gaming on the laptop. 4gb of ram is plenty, and is for the most part fast but like I said it is not blazing speed. I can type flawlessly on the keyboard, and in addition the back-light keyboard is a nice feature. The sound is pretty good, and the speakers are located to the right/left side of the laptop. Upgrading the battery and deleting the bloatware isn't to much of a hassle. This is a laptop worth buying.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for college students", "Author": "KidsCallMeMrSir", "ReviewID": "R2KH45R9LDEXEA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this laptop for my sister for college. She wanted something that was light (she's only 5' tall and can't carry a lot of weight) but still powerful. I checked it out before shipping it to her and was impressed with its speed given the size. The SSD makes a huge difference and definitely speeds things up. She uses this laptop for writing essays, doing research, browsing the web, and Netflix and has had no problems. It's a solid computer if you're not doing things like gaming or editing. Great for students.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Nice Laptop", "Author": "Donna Merriman \"DonnaLynn\"", "ReviewID": "RA3L18H950BRL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for a slim, light weight laptop and this fits the bill. I also wanted Windows 7 as I have already sent back a computer that came with Windows 8 which I hated. This computer is quick and easy to use. It also has a very clear display as well as backlit keys which are awesome. The sound is much better on this laptop than any other I have had. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is that it does not have a DVD player/function. I know it's my fault for not checking, I truly thought that every modern laptop had one! However, I did buy one that is small and plugs in easily for under $50 so I'm happy. One more good thing, it synced up easily with my existing printer which was a biggie for me. I would highly recommend this computer and seller.", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice laptop, optimal performance and good support for Linux", "Author": "Hpsaturn", "ReviewID": "RQ3G68Z8YHN9K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nice laptop, optimal performance and good support for Linux.Good:- design- good battery life (4h-6h)- all drives supported in Linux (Debian for example)- accessories (Ethernet and VGA adapters)- custom SSD and HDD partitionsBAD:- FAN a little noisy", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "perfect choice", "Author": "Cezara C.", "ReviewID": "RFLBPOP1MH4EO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This ultrabook is much more better than a macbook, and still cheaper. i'm using it for few weeks now, and i still haven't found something to dislike about it.", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for the price", "Author": "Alejandro", "ReviewID": "RNA74UCHYGYE3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This PC is almost as good as a Mac, but half the price.Pros> great design, very sleek, easy to use, good keyboard, very responsive touchpad, very good speakers for the size, backlit keyboard, easy to carry, light, doesnt get warm, good quality of the materialCons> not as fast, screen not as bright as a macbook, sometimes fan gets a bit noisyNeutral> battery is not bad, but not awesome either, it last like 5 hours with normal use", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great ultrabook at great value!!", "Author": "Enrique Iglesias", "ReviewID": "RFJHYOKCX11E8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm so glad with this purchase.

Daily internet searching, emails, paying bills, etc.  Most annoying is the keyboard.  I must type with my hands above any lower section or it inserts letters in the wrong place, (i.e. back in the middle of previous sentences)...That's the only negative I can report.  It's a home computer:)  Does have a nice trim framing, looks OK setting on the desktop.

This laptop has given me nothing but problems. Although it looks nice, the keys are super sensitive. As I type, emails get deleted, sent too soon and words get replaced. I've been using PC laptops for 10+ years and have never owned a laptop this poor.

I wanted a nice laptop to process photos and graphic creations. I wasn't looking for anything expensive or all tricked out. I'm an amateur photographer and have a nice desktop that I built to handle all kinds of graphic and video editing. But, when I travel, I wanted to have something small to take with me to tweak my photos before I returned home. This refurbished Asus fit the bill. The specs and the price were perfect. I already have a portable dvd-rom drive so this laptop not having one was not an issue. I was specifically looking for a Windows 7 PC. Everyone I know that has a Windows 8 machine hates it. I've added Total Defense Internet Security Suite for protection. I don't have plans to have this laptop online much and I'm sure this antivirus will be fine. Runs quietly in the background.So far, I only have Adobe Photoshop Elements, Artrage 3 and Corel Aftershot Pro loaded and they all work just fine.The only problem I have is with my external hard drive. It's a fairly newer Western Digital 500GB drive. But, it won't stay connected. The drive works on all my other PCs (home and work). Just doesn't like this one. Odd since I have an older external drive that works with this laptop just fine.I do love the design. The brushed metal is nice. I like that the screen isn't reflective.The fact that I can get refurbished with a Square Trade warranty for less than brand new makes me happy.", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is a budget opction", "Author": "Lee", "ReviewID": "R2464MSSB7CGRE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "prosCome on, compare to the everyone-has-it apple, Asus zenbook is a comparable product, if you are looking for alight, cool, and well-quipped device. Whatever windows 8 is criticized, windows 7 can fulfill most of your needs for processing. This light computer saves me a lot of energy in carrying and the battery power lasts. All of this comes with half price of a comparable Mac pro.Okay, the cons1. the i3 cpu may not be as fast,2. windows 7 is still not xp, it freezes3. you need to install office and some video player by yourselfPS. I have a ipad and already lose my faith in apple. I am not a Mac supporter. I agree Mac is elegant, light, and power-lasting. But the company held too much gross interests, which makes it princy. See the computer of similar cpu and functions, you will understand Mac makes too much money from your pockets. Also, it is not an age that Mac is leading anymore", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fair enough", "Author": "ignacio naveiras llorente", "ReviewID": "R3QIM81NS5F8IF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Good value for our money.A little slow at times, I'd say it gets stuck more than a 4GB-RAM computer is expected to.

I thought the track pad was ultra sensitive because it does random things like make the cursor jump around and highlight blocks of text and erases them.  I looked on line and this seems to be because the multitouch feature on the track pad doesn't work well.

Unfortunately the screen was DOA.  Never worked.  The keyboard lit up, power button indicated hard disk was running.  Returned it.
