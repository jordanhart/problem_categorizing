If you dont mind plunking down the extra $100 for the touchscreen then go for it but really you will do fine without it and save yourself $100 especially if you are buying these as gifts like I did for others in my family.Here is a list of the APPS I use on both and it runs them fast and flawlessly:Facebook, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Docs, Chrome Remote Desktop (flawlessly connects to my Windows 7 laptop and I can run any windows program remotely with ease and flawlessly connects to my Office Desktop and I can access all my office records which is key since i am a family doc), Google Cloud Print (easily prints documents to all the printers i have set up), MyBible, Kindle, Twitter, Hootsuite, Weatherbug, Netflix, Pandora, YouTube, Google+ photos (automatically puts all my photos taken on my Iphone over to my chromebook), RUNS ALL WEBSITES INCLUDING BANKING WEBSITES and my mobile hospital app FLAWLESSLY WITH CHROME (including adobe flash player sites which my Ipad and Iphone still wont run)The only CONS i can find so far are no SKYPE app.....If you want to do video calls then need to use GOOGLE HANGOUTS which is much less intuitive than skype....and you CANNOT hook a printer directly to a chromebook but you can use google cloud print to print easily...needs wifi connection to do most things (this is really not a problem for me as i am always connected and they have developed a number of apps that work when not connected including document writer and email offlineBattery Life Amazing! almost 8hrs of use!Touchscreen good but not like an Ipad (can't use your fingers to zoom in with pinch)Touchpad very good!

Initially it meant to serve me as a second laptop for occasional light work online, but very soon I realized that I was using it most of the time. My powerful Windows laptop and Mac mini were just sitting there collecting dust, getting my attention only once a week at best. I replaced my Samsung with Acer C720 2 GB RAM version two weeks ago.Here's a quick breakdown.- C720 has a slightly better screen than Samsung. Same washed out colors, but contrast and viewing angles are better, and so is brightness level. If you are spoiled by the screens of modern tablets, you might think that 1366x768 resolution would look unattractive. That's not quite right. I should remind you that MacBook's Air 11 screen has the same resolution and the same size. It's just enough to do what it's designed to do.- The keyboard layout of C720 may not be as good as Samsung's, but I like Acer's feel and key movement better. Unless you have very large hands, it might provide one of the best typing experiences in the price range below $300, and it's definitely better than most Windows laptops for that price. I write quite a lot and C720's keyboard didn't cause any significant discomfort so far. Touchpad is reasonably good, but nothing to be overexcited about. I only wish it was a bit larger.- C720 is WAY faster than Samsung. Don't be deceived by the name of the processor - this Celeron unit from the Haswell family has more processing power than Chrome OS requires. And 2 GB of RAM should be absolutely enough for anyone, who normally doesn't keep over a dozen tabs running heavy websites simultaneously. The fan would kick in from time to time, but it's very quiet and is never annoying. Boot time is typically impressive for Chrome OS devices and takes around 7 seconds.- Battery life is one of the sweetest spots of this laptop. To get promised 8.5 hours you don't have to keep the screen brightness at 50% all the time (as you would do with the Samsung to get 6.5 hours). I don't carry the charger with me and never managed to make it run out of juice. In fact, sometimes I would even give some boost to my phone's battery from C720 without worrying that it may die unexpectedly. Also, the battery charges pretty quickly.- Speakers of C720 are louder than Samsung's, but they don't sound much better - they shoot down at the table (or your lap) and don't really promise anything. But plug in headphones or external speakers and you'll get some decent sound quality for a low budget device.- The Web Camera on C720 is also superior to the one in Samsung. Promised difference in resolution might not be that visible, but it keeps higher framerate, works better in low light and seems like it captures a wider viewing angle. It is definitely an upgrade. Microphone gets the job done, but it's not very useful in somewhat noisy environment.- C720 is a little bit heavier than Samsung, but by no means it is heavy or bulky. It is still a portable laptop that could be easily moved or carried with one hand. Its build quality is better than most Windows laptops below $350. Obviously, there's nothing special about the quality of materials, but everything feels solid, the lid mechanism is sturdy enough, and overall it's not bad at all. It certainly lacks some style, but it looks and feels more expensive than it costs.I love Chromebooks for the ease of use. The first set up takes about five minutes. They are perfect for kids, for elderly people unfamiliar with computers, for students, for writers, bloggers or even programmers. It's amazing how much stuff can be done in a browser. Online shopping, social networking, managing emails, listening to music, watching movies, reading books, video chatting - everything that most casual users actually do on their computers and even more. Offline capabilities are not forgotten - you can watch movies from the local or external storage, listen to music, work with Google Docs and many other Chrome apps or even games that can run offline. One of the greatest things about Chrome OS - there is virtually no maintenance. You have to try really hard to make it work wrong. Updates are seamless and a complete reset of the system with the Powerwash, in case you want to give it away or sell it, takes just few minutes.I was skeptical when the idea of a Chromebook was introduced to the public. But when I tried one myself and gave it a proper open-minded shot, I wasn't able to go back. Today Acer C720 is my daily driver and I would change it only to a better Chromebook. For $199 it's almost impossible to beat its value. Don't forget, that with the purchase you also get 100 GB of Google Drive space for 2 years. And if you like touchscreens, C720p for $299 is also a very good deal.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Inexpensive, lightweight and powerful. The C720 2GB version is one of the best buys in tech. Period.", "Author": "Bruce Sweigert", "ReviewID": "R29C5WKSLPBMOY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a technology addict and I've been following the development of ChromeOS for a while. When it first came out, I totally understood the concept but wanted to wait for it to mature a while and the prices to come down. My trigger price point was $200 so when the 2GB version of C720 came out, I had to have one.I find it amazing that such an inexpensive device can do so much. After having it a week, it became my favorite machine just because it is so simple and light. After using it, you come to question why we need such big computing power, huge hard discs and RAM just to run a traditional OS when it comes to supporting the use cases for about 90% of what you use a PC to do. Whats even better, the Chromebook is pretty much ready to go out of the box, with an already pretty rich supply of online an offline apps don't cost you anything extra.Just like tablets came on the market and turned the PC industry upside down because they did 80% of a PC did, and did it with a better user experience, lower price with much less hardware spec. In the same way, I think the Chromebook will have a permanent place in personal tech as the one matching basic needs at the cheapest price - a second PC for around the home, or the \"throwaway\" unit for travel where you don't have to worry about damaging or losing it because its both cheap and highly secure.Specific to the C720 - I agree with most that the screen could be much better but it is still quite acceptable considering the price. The trackpad and the keyboard as well - I have no trouble using them and the trackpad is actually better than many more expensive PCs. I think the build quality is actually quite good - it looks professional and robust enough so that it can survive a road warrior's abuse.The 2GB ram is also the best value in my opinion. I've read a comparison report that showed that the 4GB really has no advantage until you open up 15-20 tabs at once, anything less than that the performance is identical. My own experience (I usually open up only 5 to 10 tabs at once) is that browsing performance is excellent - comparable to my 2013 MacBook Air with 8GB RAM that cost 5x the price.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "A decent \"backup\" computer. If you are low on funds, it can be your main machine in a pinch.", "Author": "Jeffrey Stanley", "ReviewID": "R3BXP4F6Z6VL3G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First, the hardware.I have two Macbook Pro machines (a 2009 and a 2010 model), so I have relatively high standards. This is not Apple quality, but it is superior to most cheap Windows machines and far superior to netbook machines.The overall build is 4-star. The keyboard is decent, and short of being backlit, it is almost on-par with Apple's chicklet keyboard. Vs Apple's chicklet keyboard, it has slightly less travel and a different texture, but it is very usable.The machine itself is solid: it doesn't flex and creak like most cheap machines. It is quite rigid and feels solid for a plastic notebook. It isn't as ugly as photos lead you to believe.The trackpad is nice. It is not as flawless as an Apple trackpad, but is responsive and works well. It supports two-finger scrolling (windows-style or \"natural\"). It also supports navigating forward and back with two fingers, although this gesture is definitely less responsive than with Apple's trackpad. The whole trackpad is a button, just like a Mac. You can choose whether to tap-to-click, or not.The big (huge) weakness is the display. Resolution isn't horrible compared to a non-retina Mac, but contrast is pretty bad. Unless you tilt the C720's screen perfectly, contrast is abysmal. I would gladly have paid more if it had a better display. It is the one thing that makes me regret this purchase, even at the low price.Battery life is great. I used this machine earlier this week with streaming music in the background and working on documents for work. It had 20% left after 7 hours.As is clearly stated in the description, this machine contains an OS that simply runs Google Chrome. You can get a great idea of what works and what does not by simply testing tasks in Google Chrome on a Mac, PC, or Linux box.It is surprising what can be done with just a browser. It isn't perfect, but you can do a lot.Below are some of my normal tasks, and how well they can be accomplished with the Chromebook C720.Browsing: flawless. It is full-featured Google Chrome, and it is fast and responsive. It doesn't choke on any web sites or even web apps that I have found. It can handle ten tabs easily (2gb model).Creating simple MS office documents: decent. It can create basic office documents (docs, spreadsheets, presentations) and export them for use in MS office.Editing simple Microsoft Office files: fair. It works with simple spreadsheets and documents. It can \"view\" simple Powerpoint files.It isn't great at handling complex MS office files with lots of formatting. You can probably get by in a pinch, but you will occasionally struggle and there are files you will encounter that just won't work at all.I do not have a subscription to the new \"MS Office 365\" cloud apps, so I can't speak to how well it handles them. If it works as well as Apple's cloud office apps, you should have no problems with Office 365.Edited to add: I tried Microsofts free trial of Office 365. Chrome's web office apps are just as powerful as Microsoft's web apps (though Apple iWork web apps are more powerful than both). The big difference between Microsoft web apps and Chrome web apps is the interface. The MS Office 365 interface is similar to modern MS Office with the big toolbar at the top. Google Chrome web office app interface is simpler and more like Office '97. Neither are super-powerful and I actually prefer Google Chrome's we apps to Microsoft's web apps. The Chrome apps make better use of screen real estate. Neither of them can display heavy formatting found in complex documents.Apple iWork files (Pages, Keynote, and Numbers): great, using Apple's iWork for iCloud. iCloud will warn you that the browser is not supported, but it works great. It works just as well as it does using Chrome or Safari on a Mac. It can't import your iWork files into the offline software, so Apple iWork is a cloud-only online-only option.Amazon Prime Video: failure. It simply does not work at this time (12/7/13)Edited to add: now Amazon Prime Video works fine. ??? Perhaps Amazon had some issue or the machine updated itself, but it works fine now.Netflix: works great.Network storage using the file manager: failure. There is no way to easily connect to my home NAS server or shared folders on other machines on the network using the file manager.NAS access using the browser interface: great. I have a Synology Diskstation NAS. I can watch movies, play music, and download files using the web-based interface just fine.VPN access: failed (using my work VPN). It does have a VPN setup built in, but doesn't work with my company VPN. My company VPN works fine on iPhone, iPad, and almost any computer. This is a big drawback that Google needs to fix.Printing: decent. I have an HP printer that is fully supported and it prints great (HP Officejet 7500). HP \"eprint\" printers have an email address and you just give the C720 this address for printer access. I have heard that it struggles with some printers, but I can't speak to it. The print command brings up a dialog to export your file/image/webpage/etc as a PDF file by default.Photo viewing/editing: very mixed, and mostly awful when offline. One reason I wanted this device was to carry with me along with my camera to view photos on the go. It does have a full-size SD slot (though the card protrudes from the machine and can't be left in the slot for long). The built-in offline image \"editor\" is a joke. It can only view files fitted to the screen. It can do extremely simple tasks like cropping and brightness adjustment, and that's it. You can't even zoom in on an image to inspect it closely with the built-in photo app. With difficulty, I found an offline image editor app called \"Pixir Touch Up\" that does a much better job, and will allow you to zoom in on images from your SD card, but it isn't much better than the stock app. Pixir does offer a very full-featured online photo editor that is on-par with Gimp and others. Remember, the display isn't great and isn't ideal for inspecting photos. An iPad and an EyeFi card (or iPad camera connection kit) are a much better choice for toting along on a photography adventure. Even though the display is poor, it's too bad that Google did such a lousy job with the photo app.Google Chromecast: great! It works well with my Chromecast. It works just as well as when using Chrome on my Mac.Ease of use: decent. If you already have Chrome on a Mac/Linux/PC, you know how to use it. All of you settings, bookmarks, and everything else in Chrome on a Mac just downloads right into the Chromebook.Google Drive storage: fantastic! This machine includes 100GB of Google Drive storage. Google charges $5/month for this great service and Dropbox charges twoce as much for similar service. I am Going to cancel my 100GB Dropbox and save $10/month for two years, which essentially makes this machine free. If you don't know about syncing files between your computers using Google Drive, you need to check it out. It is a bargain at $5, and a steal when free with a usable computer.The machine itself with the current software is a three star item, but it is a great value. It isn't as high-quality as a Macbook or a modern tablet, but it is so cheap that it should be a consideration if you simply cannot afford a high-end machine, or you need a backup machine. It is better than many Windows machines I have used that cost more than twice as much. It would be 4-star-plus with a better display, better file manager, better network support, and better photo viewer/editor. Hopefully Google keeps working on it and eventually upgrades the weaknesses in the software.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic, compact computer with great usability", "Author": "Gavin Fulton", "ReviewID": "R2Z8BH5KBSUQIS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you've been averse to Chromebooks before, you're like me.  There was always something that held me back.  Build quality, lack of computing power, bad battery life, etc.  This one caught my eye, with its specs anyway.  The design of the computer is understated, but the color scheme is nice, as well as the build quality for a budget computer.  Expansion slots are rather generous for this price point as well, featuring USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports, an SD card slot, and an HDMI out so I can expand my desktop and watch movies or videos on my TV if I want.  The only downside is that the shiny black bezel around the screen is rather reflective.  I'm not really sure why they went that route when the rest of the materials are pretty on point.The performance and battery life are where this computer shines the most though.  With only 2GB of RAM, you might think that it will be sluggish.  You'd be totally wrong.  With the newest Intel Celeron Processor with the Haswell Architecture, this thing not only performs well above its class in speed, it simply outdoes any of the previous Chromebooks that are anywhere near this price range.  Startup is merely seconds.  That processor also helps keep battery life very good.  I've been using this computer going on 3 weeks now and I've noticed days where I used it for 7+ hours and I still had decent battery life remaining.  A lot of this depends on what you're using your computer for; whether you're working on text in WorkFlowy, have 8 windows open in Chrome, or have your screen brightness up pretty high watching videos.  I typically keep mine at around 2/3 brightness, as I don't work in very bright places, nor do I need it to be bright.The keyboard is very nice, even though the spacing in the chiclet keys take some getting used to if you're coming from a more traditional PC keyboard.  The Function keys at top are replaced by just keys that do functions.  Makes it simple and way easier to use than some more feature-heavy Windows laptops.  The speakers, which are underneath the laptop, are actually pretty decent considering how small they are.  I prefer to just use headphones anyway, so that's not really a deal breaker for me.  The touchpad is really nice too, considering the price.  Multi-finger gestures work flawlessly and the feel of the pad is very comfortable.  The \"click\" of the pad, if you press down, is pretty noisy, but you really don't need to use it at all.I've been getting lots of questions from friends and co-workers about this little machine and I can't help but highly recommend it, just as long as you know what you're delving into.  There is a learning curve if you've never used ChromeOS before, which I hadn't, but there are handy how-to's and guides built into the OS to help you on your way.  As ChromeOS gets updates and the community of WebApps expands, these machines are going to the be at the forefront of a new revolution of computing.", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great buy for college students!", "Author": "IlyaF", "ReviewID": "R1JSGOY9VFN4A3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Acer C720 is the perfect laptop for students. I just bought this chromebook from Best Buy primarily because I wanted something light and compact to carry around campus. I have a Windows laptop that's fully loaded with a SSD, Core i7, 8gb ram, etc. All of that is fast but my laptop weights nearly 7 pounds and honestly those specs are overkill for what I need. I'm a biochem major so I don't need fancy AutoCAD or photoshop programs. All I need is document editing, browser, and a PDF viewer.The first thing I tried once I bought this little guy was opening up my PDF textbooks. I put the text books on my flashdrive, transferred them to the onboard storage and it worked! The textbooks open up offline in Chromes PDF viewer. It's brilliant! That was my main concern. I uploaded my entire iTunes library (about 4,000 songs) on to Google Music. It took several hours to upload but now I have all of my music on the cloud and it's ALWAYS with me. Yes, you will need an internet connection to listen to it but my campus has wifi everywhere. I even get connection outside between buildings.In terms of hardware, this chromebook is much thinner in person than it appears in the pictures. It is also quite a bit smaller than I was expecting but that's not a bad thing. The keyboard is slightly smaller than I would like and the keys are extremely shallow. It doesn't bother me but it'll take me a little bit to get used to. People have been saying that the trackpad is loose but I don't find that the case. I actually find it rather pleasant to use and it has many gestures that come on Apple computers. The screen is awesome on this. Sure it's not an IPS but this matte display has ample brightness, clarity, and size. I quite enjoy it. The speakers were surprising. I was expecting something sub par but for a $199 laptop, they really deliver. The bass could be stronger but I think they sound nice as they are. Lastly, the batter is awesome! The computer had no charge when I got it but it took less than an hour to charge to 100% once I plugged it in. When I unplugged it, it should 9:42 till empty! WOW! That's with two tabs open.For those wondering how the 2gb compares to the 4gb, I've got to say that the 4gb is overkill unless you open more than 30 tabs some of which are all playing video at the same time. Who does that though? I typically have 4-5 open. Occasionally, I could get up to 10 but that doesn't slow this machine down at all. I'm glad I went with the 2gb as I would never find use for the extra 2 gb of ram.This is definitely a great buy. I was really hesitant for about a month. I just couldn't decide but with Best Buys holiday return policy, I decided to give it a try. I definitely will not be returning this. In fact, I think I will be using this way more than my Windows laptop.", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Absolutely fantastic product, far exceeded my expectations", "Author": "Voltron00x \"Elias\"", "ReviewID": "R2R6AS4AXP6WHW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been reading about Chromebooks all year; the concept was pretty intriguing, despite the fact that I have a bunch of other/similar devices:  an entry-level Sony Vaio from 2011, an X51 Alienware desktop PC for gaming, a 2011 Kindle Fire, and a Moto X smartphone.  So why add a Chromebook?I wanted a multi-use device that could...Stream music from my Amazon CloudStream instant video from Amazon (great selection of kids stuff) and NetflixRun full versions of websitesHave a full keyboard, for writing emails or various other thingsThe Chromebook does all this stuff for basically the same price as a tablet, but it is much closer to a full function PC than a tablet is.  I like it as a video device far more than a tablet.  I like it for using the web far more than a tablet or smartphone.  For items not related to gaming, it has basically replaced my laptop in its entirety.About Chrome OS and this device:  I'm currently streaming music from Amazon with 9 Chrome tabs open and have no issues at all.  I have a hard time understanding what people need 4GB RAM for with this device; how is it useful to open 15+ Chrome tabs?  I haven't run into any performance issues at all.  The boot time is absurd.  7 seconds may be underestimating.  It also shuts off instantly when you hit shutdown.Thus far I've had no real issues with the Chrome store or apps; Google Docs is fine so far for working with MS Word items, and in fact Google Drive is now installed on all my devices because I've started doing my writing on this device.  Remote Desktop lets you connect to any of your Windows PCs for using Windows programs through those computers if you really need to, though I imagine I'd have to be using this more for work to need that for anything.I've used this to watch a decent amount of content on Netflix and Amazon Instant.  The screen is... ok.  It isn't all that bright and won't \"wow\" you but as a portable mini-TV it does the job.  My son loves watching his kids shows on this, which lets us reclaim the real TV for our purposes.  Speaker quality is likewise functional but won't blow you away.  Headphones are the way to go when possible.  As it relates to both of these, I'm perfectly happy with the quality for the price.I didn't have any issues with the keyboard, I'm normally a 90 WPM typer and am probably a bit slower on this, more due to the size than anything.  I actually like the trackpad to be honest.  Not sure why folks don't.  It isn't the worlds greatest but is way better than the one on my Dell PC from work and perhaps marginally worse than the one on my Vaio.  My basic Logitech wireless mouse worked fine with the Chromebook, but I stopped using it pretty quickly as I got used to the trackpad.  The dual-finger scrolling and chrome forward/backward helps a lot.Battery life is pretty nuts.  I've gotten about 7 hours of pure video streaming.  At the high end, just off the charger, you get some arbitrarily high readings (like 9+ hours) but I think the claimed 8 hours is probably accurate.The fact that you can \"hack\" this thing into installing Ubuntu is awesome.  I haven't done it yet, but the concept is very cool.  Native gaming in Chrome OS is miserable outside a few highlights; I'd say the main one is the Chrome version of Bastion, which suggests companies COULD make some great games if they wanted to.  But with Ubuntu, you can theoretically play Linux-compatible games you may have; I know I have a bunch from Humble Bundle (such as FTL) that should run great on this laptop, even if it wasn't meant to do so.  I bet it can run older games very well also, such as Half Life 2 or the original Portal.  My next project is to play around and see if I can pull off Steam and if the 16GB SSD can handle something like that.  If so, I'd give this thing... six stars?  Can't really give it more than I already am.Anyway... know what you're getting into here.  This isn't a full Windows laptop.  You can install Linux and access a lot of full-featured laptop programs that way, but even still, your hard drive space is limited and this may be beyond the basic users capabilities.  If you do video compiling, music or photo editing, gaming, etc. as your main laptop activities, this would need to be a 2nd computer for you.  If you find yourself using alternate devices like a smartphone or tablet in your house for watching movies, listening to music, or browsing the web, you might get great mileage out of this device. I know I have.Highly, highly recommended device.  I love this thing.EDIT: Just over 90 days of use later, and I can tell you that I've completely fallen in love with this device. It is the fastest Chrome device in my house, far faster than the dual-core Sony Vaio it replaced and even faster than my core i7 Haswell gaming desktop. I've installed Ubuntu 13.04 and 13.10, both XFCE and Unity, through both USB 3.0 and SD card, and played Minecraft and Steam games on this thing. The batter life is still epic. What else is there to say?  This is, hands down, the single best value buy in all of computing right now.If you want to read more about Chromebooks and you're not sure if they're right for you, check this out:  [...]", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Exactly what I wanted", "Author": "Jim", "ReviewID": "R2PLF201IPDMR4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I personally purchased the 4gb ram version, but it's basically the same thing...I honestly love this thing, I use it constantly, but this is due tot he fact that I use chrome os AND debian linux. Many people that have given this a poor rating is because they believe it needs internet access to do anything. They obviously bought this type of computer for the wrong reason, and not enough knowledge. If you want to use it as an only online computer in chrome os, go ahead... But that is only using half of the potential, if not less, that this machine has to offer.Personally I use this computer for programming, and as a media device to randomly plug into tv's and such. I also use this any time I am not at home, seeing as it is so portable and has an easy 10 hours of battery life, its great.Another reason people dislike this product is because it can't play games. Well it can... Personally I don't game on this computer, I have another computer dedicated to that, and I use the chromebook to be productive, but if I really wanted to, I could install steam on any decent version of linux (debian, arch, fedora, centos, ubuntu, etc.) and play games. I have seen people play Skyrim on this chromebook (albeit on the lowest graphics settings).Overall, it is a great computer, but you should really try and unleash the full potential of it yourself, or else you won't be having the best time you could with your new chromebook.EDIT: An easy way to make your chromebook run chrome os and another version of linux is to google search \"crouton\" and go to the \"dnschneid/crouton \u00b7 GitHub\" entry, and follow the instructions. It basically installs the chosen distro of linux inside chrome os, and you run it inside chrome os, allowing you to seamlessly switch between both os's at any time with a simple key combo. Personally I use Debian Jessie with LXDE, if you don't know what I just said, just follow the instructions, which will give you Ubuntu with XFCE.Also, to do this you need to have your chromebook in developer mode. You can do this by:  -Press and hold the Esc+F3 (Refresh) keys, then press the Power button. This enters recovery mode.  -Now, press Ctrl+D (no prompt). It will ask you to confirm, then the system will revert its state and enable developer mode.  -Press Ctrl+D (or wait 30 seconds for the beep and boot) at the white boot splash screen to enter Chrome OS.

I've owned the original CR-48 prototype, the Samsung Series 5, and the Samsung Series 3. I can honestly say this is the best chromebook so far.

It is a matte finish and you have to appreciate the anti-glare viewing you will get outside.The major selling points for me regarding this chromebook are the battery and the processing power. I have many computers, but nothing browses the web and renders web pages faster than this chromebook.  It does boot in 7 seconds or less and you can have many tabs open and still browse with great speed. The keyboard and mouse are sufficient too.  I would put them in the \"average\" category and they get the job done.  There are no issues and it is easy enough to type that I am writing this review on the chromebook.The battery life is also exceptional.  I easily get 7 hours on a charge and rarely have to carry the (also light and small) charger.  That is a plus for me as a student and a teacher.The C720 won't win any beauty contests (unlike the HP 11 Chromebook) but the beauty is on the inside.  If you want a chromebook, this is the best of the bunch in this price range.  I will not be getting rid of this chromebook anytime soon. This is what a chromebook should be!", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love my Chromebook!", "Author": "Emma", "ReviewID": "RHQTM0RWW7K3N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm in my last semester (hopefully) of my undergrad and my 4 year old HP Envy quit on me in the first week of this semester. I've had my Chromebook for about a month now, so I think I'm a little qualified to leave a pretty accurate review.Overall, I absolutely love my Chromebook. It is an amazing little device and I will probably never go back to a PC (I'm not a Mac person at all so I can't compare it to them). Now, as a disclaimer, I am not someone who does online gaming or software video editing. At most, I'll edit some pictures and maybe edit some music files, so I cannot attest to this devices ability to fulfill those needs (though it doesn't seem like it would be very compatible with them). However, as someone who needs a computer mostly for internet, research, email, music, social networking, and document editing, this thing is amazing.PROS1. Speed. This thing is a beast. It comes out of a sleep faster than my Kindle will start up (if I shut it down, not just if I wake it up from sleeping). It's kind of incredible how fast it boots. Internet browsing and document editing is awesome, video viewing is great (YES, this OS IS great for Netflix and online streaming, don't believe what you've heard if it is contrary to what I just said).2. Display. I really like the Chrome OS layout (it's pretty similar to Windows 7, which I liked a lot more than any devices with Windows 8 that I've tried--my phone has Windows 8 and I kind of hate it now that I have my Chromebook). It's intuitive and simple--the whole setup process for me took like ten minutes tops.3. Sync with Google. I can access all of my stuff EVERYWHERE. I used Google Drive before, but not as heavily. It is soooo so nice to have all of your material on whatever computer you may have access to.4. Apps. Google has come out with some really useful apps for these devices and they're only making more.5. Hardware. I love the way this Acer laptop is set up. The sound is surprisingly wonderful for such a small machine, AND it has separate \"speakers' and \"headphones\" settings for sound. No more plugging my headphones in, forgetting I had the volume cranked earlier that day, and having my ear drums blown out. It's a simple but beautiful thing and I don't know why more manufacturers don't do it. The top row of keys is as follows: Escape, Back (internet browser button), Forward, Refresh, Fullscreen, I don't know what to call the next button but if you hit it it brings all the things you have open up on your desktop screen and you can click on what you want to go to, Dimmer, Brighter, Mute, Volume Down, Volume Up, Power. The \"programs\" button is awesome, I use it all the time to get to something else that I have open but don't want to scroll through everything to find, and having the internet back, forward, and refresh buttons on the keyboard is surprisingly nice. Some people say they're worried about hitting the power button accidentally, but to turn it off you have to hold it for a few seconds, so it's difficult to do it by accident. The screen is matte, so you can still see things if you're outside or by a window, and the trackpad is awesome--two finger scroll, click with two fingers for a right click, and you can enable tap to click in the settings (which I was thrilled with because I hate pushing down every time). Unfortunately, though, there's no zoom feature on the trackpad. That's my only complaint about it. This thing is SO lightweight overall--with my old computer, if I lugged it around campus my shoulders would kill me, but with this one I can barely tell it's in my backpack.6. Sleep/Occasional Crash Recovery. Any time I've put this to sleep, turned it off without closing things, or had it run out of memory and need to restart abruptly, I have not lost a single thing. Are crashes desirable? No. Do they happen? Yes. Does this thing deal with them well? Absolutely. On a computer with only 2 gb of RAM I kind of expected a few crashes because I can be a heavy internet browser, but when it restores itself, all my tabs come back and whatever I was working on is safe.7. Battery Life. Battery life battery life oh my gosh battery life. I am AMAZED with it. One day I was using it to watch Netflix and bum around on the internet and the battery was at about 60% and I didn't have to plug it in for FIVE hours. On a full charge, it will do at least 8 if you're not watching videos, and about 6 or 7 if you are. It's absolutely incredible and if it's the one reason you buy this computer, I wouldn't judge that decision (other than to say it's totally reasonable). It's wonderful and cannot be matched. It's also super convenient when I need to take it to class and am not sitting close to a power outlet. My old HP would get 3 hours MAX when the batter was new. If this computer only lasted 3 hours, I would wonder what was wrong with it. The lack of a need to plug in is a beautiful, beautiful thing and it is definitely unparalleled.8. Google Docs. At first I was worried about not having Microsoft Word, but honestly, Google's line of word processing programs are so similar that it doesn't even matter. You can save things as .docx or .pdf and then anyone can view them in the \"traditional\" format. It's absolutely not necessary to have Microsoft Word. Plus, there are plenty of converter apps that Google has to view things from other people and turn them into Google Docs so you can edit them, and then turn them back into pdfs or whatever you need.CONS1. Sometimes it crashes. It happens with all computers. However, as I said, it reboots well and I've never lost anything.2. The fact that all my stuff is on the cloud... I'm a little uncomfortable with it. I have an external hard drive with most of my files on it (especially videos and stuff). I've never had any problems with hacking, but it worries me slightly. However, Google is constantly improving security, so I'm not ALL that worried. The nice thing is that you can set up \"2 Step Verification,\" so when you (or potentially someone else) log into your google account from a previously unused computer, you have to supply your password AND google sends your phone a text with a code to put in. You have to have your phone to log in, but this gives me a little more peace of mind.3. Desire to Learn (this online software that my school uses for virtually everything) issues. The dropbox on Desire to Learn won't let me upload files. This has been an absolute pain and I have to make sure that I either have my Kindle Fire charged so I can send PDFs to it and then upload them with that, or that I'm on campus so I can use a public computer to turn in my assignment. This is my biggest complaint and I hope I can resolve it eventually, though I don't know how I could do it on my own.4. Printing. I haven't sat down yet to try to connect my printer to cloud print. I know there are directions, I know you are supposed to be able to print with Chromebooks, but there are so many extra steps that I just haven't bothered with it yet. I've resorted to printing on my campus and my printer has gone dormant. Maybe eventually I'll hook it up and change this to a pro, but for now, it's a hindrance.5. File Explorer. The file explorer is pretty simple but is sometimes kind of glitchy. Usually if I put my computer to sleep and wake it up again it solves that problem, but it's annoying nonetheless.FINAL VERDICTOverall, if you're not a huge gamer or video editor, this computer is amazing. All these great features combined with the outstanding price make it a fantastic choice for those who just use computers for internet and document editing. Contrary to Microsoft's Chrome OS slam commercials, IT IS NOT USELESS WITHOUT AN INTERNET CONNECTION. No, you can't access websites, but you can't do that offline with a PC anyway. You can still make documents and they'll just save to your small hard drive and sync with Google Drive later. It saves the most recent things you've worked on, and if you want more you can use an external hard drive or flash drive (or physically move files to the offline drive) to access more files offline. Honestly, though, I'm so rarely without an internet connection that it doesn't even matter anyway.I would recommend this computer wholeheartedly (and have many times in the past month). It's compact, intuitive, useful, and does almost everything a common PC will do.

I have been wanting a Chromebook for some time but wasn't sure what to expect.  I was really impressed with my Acer tablet that was low cost but clearly a solid device, so when Acer came out with this Chromebook with the new Haswell processor I decided to jump on it.  I care more about performance than looks so I went with the Acer since it was getting good performance reviews.  I was also looking for a another small and light computer that I could take with me when I travel for work that I could use for my personal use - I like to keep personal and work usage completely separate.I have been using this laptop for several weeks now and I am very impressed.  This is now my favorite computer!  I did upgrade the SSD drive to a 64Gb drive which seemed to improve the performance and I have been pleased every since.  As Google says, it is instant on and off so you never wait.  The battery life seems to last forever.  It far exceeds any other laptop I have every had, especially at this extremely low weight.  I love that TPM is build into the platform for heavy encryption of the storage and I like having separate profiles between users.It is a shift to have your data and applications come from the cloud but it works and completely integrates with my phone, a Samsung Note 3.  Once I got familiar on how to use my Chromebook and Google tools, I decided to move all of my personal content to my Google Drive - all of my pictures, documents, music, etc.  I encrypt sensitive information with Boxcryptor on my Google Drive.  This works well on my Chromebook and my phone.  I am now using my C720 for doing just about everything I use a computer for - creating and editing documents, editing and posting pictures, doing video calls and messaging with Google Hangouts. watching movies, listening to music and more.By the way, the wireless radio on this laptop is amazing.  I have not seen another laptop beat it in speed tests on my wireless network - this includes custom gaming laptops with special wireless cards, a Macbook pro, iPads, phones, etc.  Only my Samsung Note 3 with support of 802.11ac comes close.  I couldn't believe it at first but test after test showed the same result.  Simply amazing especially at this price point!  I am not sure how Acer did this.Wi-Fi access in Google sponsored locations is automatic as well.  I noticed that I got instance access in some locations without hitting the captive portal page and having to go through a registration process to get Internet access.  That is pretty cool.  When I travel, I like this laptop to my mobile hotspot on my phone and I am connected whenever I want to be.There are times when I am using unsecured public Wi-Fi that I like to get my access through a VPN tunnel so I set up my Chromebook to use a L2TP VPN tunnel.  You can set it to automatically connect to the VPN server once Wi-Fi is connected and this works very reliably.I also use this laptop with an external mouse, keyboard and monitor in docking mode.  I was even more surprised to see this laptop drive the display on my laptop while also driving my external display that is a 1080p monitor through HDMI.  You can extend the display or mirror your laptop display.  Either way works very well and I have never had even one issue, which is rare.  I have seen Macbooks and Windows computers choke on driving external displays more often than they should.Watching video on this laptop has been a very good experience as well.  I watch Netflix, YouTube & Google movies and my own video files with no issue on my laptop or with an external display.  The video is very smooth.  By the way, any Google movie you buy can also be watched through YouTube.This laptop will also reach multiple file systems on USB drives.  I have tried Windows and Linux partition formations without issue.In summary, this is a solid device from Acer.  This laptop will spoil you and delivers far more value that most laptops several times more expensive.  It is easy to use by design but it is very functional for a wide range of users.  I am recommending this laptop to everyone looking for laptop.  There are some new ways of doing things in the Google Chromebook model but I think that is an easy transition to make and will greatly simplify your life once you do!  I also suggest looking at some of the Chromebook books on tips and tricks.  That really helped me in my transition as well.", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "For the price, you can't say anything wrong about it.", "Author": "Erica Goodman", "ReviewID": "R5T8GZAH3ZN1L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "(this review written by Erica's 10 year old son)  This is a great laptop. Before you read this entire review you need to know that this is a Chromebook. If you already know what a Chromebook is then go to the next paragraph. Chromebooks can't run .exe files like a PC or a Mac can. It does most things in the Chrome browser. So if I wanted to play Cut The Rope, I would go on the Chrome Web Store, \"download\" it, and it's, \"installed.\" Then, when I want to play Cut The Rope, I press the Cut The Rope button and it opens up Google Chrome on a certain webpage where you can play Cut The Rope. So If you wanted to play Minecraft, you shouldn't get a Chromebook because Minecraft and pretty much anything that you need to download (like Microsoft Word or Spotify) is probably a .exe file. But you can still do a lot of stuff on a Chromebook. Google Docs lets you edit documents and you get 100 GB of Google Drive storage on Google's servers, or \"The Cloud, \" to edit and store your documents. Also, Microsoft has Word Online which lets you, well, use Microsoft Word and store it in \"The Cloud,\" except you store it on Onedrive instead of Google Drive, unless you download it onto the Acer C720's 16 GB solid state drive. (At least, I got the 16 GB version. It also comes in a 32 GB version.)  So, for the nerds, here are all the technical specs:OS: Chrome OSProcessor: 1.4 GHZ Intel Celron 2955UMemory: 16/32 GB storage, SDD (There are two types of hard drives: SDD and HDD. SDD works like a flash drive and a HDD has a disk. SDD's have bettery battery life and speed up the computer a lot.) 2GB RAM, and a free 100 GB on Google Drive. Also has an SD card slot.Screen:11.6,\" LCD, 1366 x 768, 135.09 ppiConnectivity: HDMI, two USB 3.0 ports, Bluetooth 4.0, and Wifi.Battery: I couldn't Google the MaH in the battery, but it lasts about 7.5 - 8 hours.Ok, so after I wrote all that I just noticed Amazon has the specs right on it, so you can also look at that if you want.Now, for the actual laptop on the outside. Even though it only has a pixel density of 135 ppi (pixels per inch, 135 is terrible), it still works and shows me what's on the screen. Unless I'm not looking at it. The speakers work great, and if you plug in headphones it automatically adjusts it so it doesn't scream in my ears. And when I take them out, it makes the speakers loud again, so I can still hear it from about a foot away. It's really thin and light, I can carry it with one hand under it while it's turned on easily. The battery life on this is amazing, it's one of my favorite parts of the C720. Lastly, the processor on the C720 is decent. It's fast enough for a laptop, and great for a $200 laptop.In conclusion, this is a good laptop. If you like video games, a nice screen, or anything that you need to download, then I'm wondering why you would be reading this review in the first place.

I originally bought it for travel to Hawaii for reasons why chromebooks were built and designed for - ultra light, long battery life, laptop design (prefer over tablet type). The most significant positive feature that struck me about this Acer C720 was its remarkable time usage. I knew it was long as reviews that I read stated but it was even more impressed. I remember my first morning I woke up (very early start as Hawaii time zone was three hours behind PT), turned on my C720 at 4 AM and used it until 2 PM.

It serves a introduction to computing for new users and as a good traveling computer for PC users. Acer and YouTube have many tutorials on the features and use of Chromebooks. Check these out before you buy.Tablets and Chromebooks are similar in a lot of ways. They are primarily for online use, they have very short boot up times, they don't drain much power in standby mode, and the price range is about the same. My Acer C720 boots in less than 10 seconds and goes several days in standby without a recharge. and cost $200. My Nexus 10 cost $400. Both tablets and Chromebooks require much less upkeep than a PC, for things like backup and virus protection. And the complexity is much reduced from that of a PC. There are fewer options, so there is less confusion in learning how to accomplish the tasks you want to do on a computing device. And, every hacker is not trying to download stuff on your device that you don't want. So when you evaluate a Chromebook, compare it more to a tablet rather than a PC.Where Chromebooks and tablets differ is in productivity. Tablets have a touchscreen and apps which are convenient for consuming information, but the browsers are substandard compared to a PC, and there is no real keyboard for data entry. In that respect, Chromebooks are much more like a PC. For new users contemplating buying a PC, a Chromebook is a much shorter path to learning how to use a PC, than a tablet. For less than half the price of a PC a Chromebook is a cheap and easy way to get into computing, and it may be all that a lot of people will ever need.The Chromebook can be set up to do the same things you can do on a PC with the Google Chrome browser. However, it's not limited to Google applications, only applications that work within the Chrome browser. Any web application that works in the PC Chrome browser works on a Chromebook. For example, Microsoft SkyDrive, Netflix, Spotify, Pandora, RSS readers, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, gmail, Outlook mail, etc, all work in the Chrome browser so they also work on a Chromebook just like they work on a PC. This is not true of tablets. Tablet apps are configured differently from PC applications.If you're using the Chrome browser now on your PC you know that it has many extensions like Add This sharing, Readability, Hangouts, free Google phone calling, etc. These are all available on the Chromebook. As a PC user, my Chromebook fits my particular needs much better than my Nexus 10 tablet. About the only thing I use my Nexus 10 for now are things like Hangouts, and other casual activities that don't require input.\ufeff", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent \"little\" machine", "Author": "Michael Hoyt \"SanDiegoSeahawk\"", "ReviewID": "R7BWZPAWQVQSE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Super fast Chromebook.

At first, the switch was weird, as it would be for anyone in any situation where one uses an unfamiliar device. But once I figured out how to utilize and customize the Chrome OS to my liking, I've become a very happy Chromebook user.After I set everything up to my liking, I started noticing a lot of nay-saying about the Chromebook I've come to love and use as my primary computer. A lot of this negative talk has come from Microsoft and, I suppose, power users. Or people who just don't like Google in general.But I digress on the latter because that's such a heated topic and that's not what I want to write in my review about. What I do want to do, though, is dispel this misconception that the Chromebook is a total brick without wi-fi.Here's what I can do offline:- Listen to music- Read epub and mobi ebooks- Read pdf files- Write txt, docx, and gdoc files- Get to my Google Drive- Play games (though I'll be honest, I don't play games on my Chromebook, but I know it is something I could do if I wanted; it's just that any game you want to play has to be on the Chrome store and it needs to be made for both online and offline use)- Read email- Create mindmaps- Create notes on Google Keep- Create tasks on WunderlistNow, one may still think that's still not a lot, but let's keep this in perspective: this is how I utilize my Chromebook every day, excluding whatever browsing I might do on the Internet. And these are the only tasks that I want to have if I'm offline. When I'm online, I do a lot of other stuff, granted--but for those days I might not have wi-fi, I can rest assured knowing I can at least do what I need to do on my Chromebook without any issues or panic.So clearly, the Chromebook isn't a brick offline. All the essentials are there. And honestly, I find it much nicer because there's less distraction. I can focus on my tasks throughout the day instead of fiddling with my desktop and groaning about using a laptop that I feel like I will never utilize completely. In that way, Chromebook shines. It's not for everyone, but it is for someone like me.EDIT: I also want to add that I watch videos online, on YouTube and other websites, and it works wonderfully. I have no complaints. In fact, I've found that videos load more quickly on this Chromebook than it did on the HP laptop I used to have. On the HP laptop, if I was watching a movie online, it'd take an hour or two to load completely. On the Chrome OS, the same video might take, what--5 or so minutes to load.

It does the job expected, in a very competent fashion.I bought it after an in-store trial of 3-4 different Chromebooks.  This one was clearly faster, snappy compared to molasses (the other models) at loading a complex web site.  I still feel like I never wait for it to do something.  Now, I'm not opening more than 2 windows at a time, nor do I expect this to be a high end gaming device or a monster calculation machine.

In my typical short daily uses (5 minutes here, 20 minutes there), it seems to last about a week.Chrome has opened every web site successfully.  No problems.  I had no problems using Logmein to remotely access a work computer (but with their recent company issues I have switched to VPN on Win 7.  I haven't tried VPN on the Chromebook).I was surprised there wasn't a direct WiFi link to my printer.  The free Cloud Printing from Google works fine...perhaps a few seconds more delay reaching the printer than my local WiFi would give.Mostly I'd say the take home lesson is that you turn it on (quickly!) and it just works.

I was undecided whether to go for the C720 or the C720P- the touchscreen option but eventually opted to go with what I had tried and tested. Got it less than 24 hours ago.We already have a Macbook Air, Macbook Pro and an iMac at home. I got the Chromebook for myself- passing on the Air to the kids.Very happy with my choice. Can do everything I do with the Air except one (coming to it soon). I browse the net, open and save all MS Office files- Word, Excel, Powerpoint. Just downloaded the 3 Office applications from the Chrome Store- haven't tried them out as yet. Even if that doesn't work out the Google options are pretty good.I can browse any website, save files locally and print (via Google Cloud Print). I am an Android user (Nexus 5) and most of the features available on the Chromebook either supplement or complement what I already had on the phone. Some of them are given below:Google+ Photos: My photos from my phone are already automatically backed up to Google+. Photos from our iMac (main repository of photographs) are also automatically to Google+. The Google+ Photo app in the Chromebook just enhances the experience of browsing those photographs though one could also look at it in the Chrome browser in Google+Google Cloud Print: I can easily print from the phone and the Chromebook does the same. I have a HP 3510 and it connects to the printer via HP ePrint.Evernote: I use the Evernote for web. Works very well, in fact is faster than the desktop application in the Mac. Doesn't work offline though. I also use the Chrome browser extension for Evernote to add notes and clip web pages very well. Another alternative could be Keep (from Google).Google Drive: works just like the phone. Accessible even offline. And with the 100GB of storage for 2 years it is a great plus. If you do end up using the 100 GB, even after 2 years if you don't want to pay for it- it should still work- you just won't be able to save more files above the free (15GB) limit but be able to access all the existing files in the Drive.Hangouts: works with the Chrome browser extension or within Google+.Speed is excellent. The battery life is just out of the world. It is like a camel in the desert without water- it can go on and on and on.What's my biggest gripe? Skype. I use it pretty often and it is the choice of most when it comes to video calling, across the world. The alternative offered is Hangout video calling. But as a medium of communication this is still to catch on and this is the most restrictive feature of the Chromebook. Akin to Skype Out, Hangouts also provides the facility to call phones and mobiles by buying credit- works across the world and not only specific countries (the purchasing of the credit).Of course the requirement of being on line for most of the tasks is also restrictive but then that is a given and known when you buy the Chromebook.Two other products which I have figured out are not available but might be high use apps are Spotify and Picasa. The latter is surprising considering it is from Google, but I think the objective is to push everyone onto Google+ Photos.Sound is excellent. Has a small bass and is more than adequate.Overall- this (and any Chromebook) can not be your primary PC/laptop. But is a must get for easy access, browsing and great battery life.

Lightning fast processor in a computer that does 95% of what I use a computer for.  There is ONE Windows only program that I have to use for work, so I still have to have a Windows machine around for that.  I use my Mac at home for photo editing but I'm experimenting with the web based solutions in Chrome, which get better and better each day.I have a 27\" IPS monitor for my Mac Mini with a DVI input (Mac) and an HDMI input (Chromebook).  I connect the Chromebook with the HDMI, I connect a bluetooth mouse and keyboard, shut the lid on the Chromebook (that automatically puts it into \"docking\" mode, so it runs with the cover closed.  Cover closed shuts off the built in screen, so the battery life more than doubles- no need to plug it in when I dock), I tuck the Chromebook away alongside the monitor, and I have a complete desktop computer system that takes up little space on my desk. And no slouch.  The graphics are identical to that which my i7 Mac Mini puts out (1920 x 1080).  1080p YouTube videos no issue.  1080p videos play back from an SD card, no problem.  Haswell processor is lightning fast- instant response.  Web pages load and open faster than on the Mini (ad block pro extension is key).  The audio can play through the monitor via HDMI (if it has speakers, mine does not) or through the Chromebook's speakers.  The Chromebook's speakers are outstanding for a laptop, the best I have heard on a laptop ANYWHERE CLOSE to this price point.  Speakers fire both downwards against the desk surface, and also up through the keyboard.  You can not tell where the sound is coming from, it just sounds great.So, $199 for Chromebook, $275 (or less) for a monitor, $50 for keyboard and mouse, around $500 for a top line, lightning fast desktop replacement.  Add a USB3 external drive or USB3 stick and I have local storage, though the Chromebook comes with 2 years of Google Drive storage.  Now, when I leave the house, I grab the Chromebook and take it with me.  Small, very light, packed inside my $9 Amazon Basics neoprene sleeve.Best of all, since it's Google connected, if you enable Google Sync, if you need to wipe it clean and start fresh (aka, Powerwash), as soon as you log in to your Google account, all of your apps, desktop, configurations etc automatically and practically instantly download, so your machine is back where you had it.  Nothing to re-install, nothing to re-configure, etc.  If your files are stored at Google Drive or Dropbox, they all automatically show back up, nothing was lost.  This is the future of computing.  Resistance is futile.Here are the two bummers:1.  I can not figure out how to get IMAP mail working on it.  My Android phone and tablet (with limited local storage) have IMAP mail, why not my Chromebook?  I use IMAP for work e-mail and Gmail.  It could be configured to only download the most recent emails to not take up space on the SSD.  Choose to save certain messages and attachments locally, etc. that I may need later or offline.  I need a standalone IMAP client for it, or the Gmail offline client needs to include IMAP. If I had that, I could almost get rid of my Mac.2.  The built-in screen's resolution could be better.  I am spoiled by my 27\" IPS screen, I want that contrast and brightness on my Chromebook as well. Yes, I can spend more on a \"better\" Chromebook and get a better screen, I know.Here's a Top Tip for people who already own a Chromebook or are buying one.  This unit comes with 2GB of RAM which is fine, but if you open a lot of webpages or watch huge videos it might bog a little.  Chrome OS runs on Linux, and in Linux there's something called zRam.  zRam creates a RAM swap file on your hard drive, 1.5 times the size of your physical RAM.  Since the hard drive in the Chromebook is an SSD, data moves between RAM and that swapfile instantly.  Once you enable zRam, it will add a 3GB RAM swap file on your SSD, so now your 2GB RAM Chromebook effectively has 5GB of RAM, instantly and for free.  It is a persistent change- it stays there even after you reboot.Here's how:1.  Hit ctrl-alt-T, a browser window opens with a message about Crosh, the Chrome OS developer shell, followed by a command prompt (\"crosh>\")2.  Type \"swap enable\" (no quotes) and hit enter.  Crosh confirms that you've created a swap file that will be active when you re-boot.3.  Re-boot, and enjoy your free RAM upgrade.  w00t.", "Date": "May 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "What a good deal.", "Author": "Roberto V.

Of course, I can access my files online, but for business reasons I cannot move some of these to Google Drive.3) A few specific, proprietary non-web applications that will run on Chrome OS (or Ubuntu or OSX for that matter). My workaround for this is Chrome Remote Desktop, whereby I can access my Windows machine perfectly from my Chromebook.Other than that, I can do everything I need including email, calendar, shopping, news reading, weather, and checking a couple of social sites.

It's not much heavier, but you can really feel it. It was a little disappointing when I first picked it up. Still, it's not exactly a sack of bricks. It's really light, just not as light.-It feels sturdier. The keys on the Samsung constantly fall off, but these feel like they're holding on well (so far). I'll certainly update if I have problems.-The keys are a little hard to press in the beginning. It takes a few days of getting used to, but they are definitely harder to press than my macbook pro and just about any other modern keyboard I've used. That's not necessarily a bad thing, just a matter of taste.-The screen is beautiful on both machines.All in all, I'm happy I got this machine over the Series 3, mainly because of the issue with the keys falling off of the latter.

It is a laptop with its own system that relies on everything Google, and runs the operating system \"Chrome OS\".  Chrome OS does not allow for \"programs\" to be run in the manner that Windows or Mac does. It is almost fully browser-dependent (but not to the extreme that you can't use the computer without an internet connection). You run \"programs\" in the Chrome browser, and they run quickly and efficiently, with hardly any hesitation. Unlike that of Windows' program launching, Chrome OS is nearly immediate and glorious in its ability to do your bidding.The first thing you will note about the system is that it boots in under 7 seconds so that you can come from a cold start to having logged-in and ready for work or play. I am used to having my Windows 7 installation tweaked for high performance, but the Chrome OS needs no help there.  A few things before I really get into it should be noted:There is no firewall to configure; no need for virus protection; system is automatically updated without bother, and has an SSD (solid state drive for virtually noiseless computing), and can run up to 8 to 9 hours on one charge.  The OS requires no license validation and can be re-installed quickly if need be. Sounds intriguing? Stick around and hold on to your wig because this thing will flip it!This particular model is the C720-2848, at $200, a revamping of the older C710.  The Intel Celeron Haswell architecture brain that runs it is quite faster than the prior model, C710's Celeron brain, and comes with either 2GB of DDR3 ram or, for more handling power, 4GB, for $50 more. It appears for most users that is over-kill, as most won't have more that 10 to 12 windows running at the same time. My model is capable of having several Youtube videos playing, and several other windows open, with no adverse hit in performance. Should you choose to try a Chromebook, don't pick the older model, regardless of sales discount inducement.When you boot into your Chromebook you are met with a desktop, similar to a Windows PC, but there are no icons on the desktop. Instead, there is a sidebar where you chose which program you wish to use. You want to surf, you click the Chrome icon, and you are quickly sent off to the internet. There is also an apps icon that you click in order to see all of your applications that are available to you. These applications can be downloaded (downloaded here means: the shortcut to the application that will play in the Chrome browser) from the Chrome Store. You can build quite an impressive amount of useful apps for work or play and delete them (getting rid of the shortcut to the application) as you see fit. An example of a utility app is Screencastify, a screen video recorder that can record all you do with or without sound. You can also capture video with the webcam. Snagit, from Techsmith, is another useful app for screen recording or snapping shots of anything that you want on any page you go to.  Another useful application is Clearly, an app that rids pages of all extraneous litter, leaving only text so that you can read or save it.  There is a growing lineup of games that can be played via the browser as well, one of which is still popular, Angry Birds. You won't be able to play more demanding games, but this is not a gaming computer. As more and more users Skype now than ever before, Chromebook users are not as fortunate. But you can use Google Hangout for calls and video chatting. All sorts of utility apps and more are populating the Chrome Store, so this is just the beginning of what may turn out to be a most welcome and fast-growing app market for your Chromebook.The Chromebook can not accept printers via usb (remember: you can't install programs), but you can wirelessly print via Google Cloud Print to your printer as long as you have a printer that is capable of cloud printing. Nearly all printers for just under $100 have this feature today.Typing on the keyboard was an unexpected pleasure, as I have never been able to type comfortably with any laptop I've ever used. The touch pad is responsive and utilizes the familiar one finger mouse move, and two and three finger gestures, the latter being for scrolling back and forth through the open windows. You can plug in a usb or wireless mouse and keyboard, but you probably won't need to.As for music play, the speakers for a low-cost computer as this sound great.  There's appreciable loudness with hardly any noticeable shrill at very 80% volume. The is some slight bass, not heavy and shouldn't be expected on this laptop.  The bluetooth works with newer versions and is backwards compatible with bluetooth 2.0 and up.For light users of Microsoft Office, Google Docs takes over the job. It will read, write and edit the documents. Just don't expect it to be on par with its very expensive brotheren.This model comes with 16 GB (there is a 32 GB SSD --Solid State Drive-- version available) of drive storage and can be supplemented with Google Drive cloud storage (free) for additional storage. You can also slip in an SD card up to 64 GB for .PDF files, documents of all extensions, movies, pictures and music.As for entertainment, Youtube and Netflix is clear and never stutters. Watching movies one SD card on the matte-finish 11.5 \" screen is better than expected for such a low priced laptop. No complaints here.There's an HDMI out port and one USB 3.0 and one USB 2.0 port, headphone/mic input.At just 2.7 lbs, this laptop is not cumbersome and stays very cool even after hours of play. I am writing this document on it and I feel quite comfortable doing it. I can't say that about any laptop I've used in the past. I've seen the best of laptops come my way for repair, and not once was I enthralled by the keyboard.  I love this keyboard!When you are not connected to the internet, you can still enjoy your Chromebook to some extent.  You can still write documents, read and write email (for sending later), play one of many free games, read a book or just settle in for a good old movie.  It isn't as crippled as Microsoft's damning commercial makes it out to be, is it?The question now, is: Is this for you? If you aren't a lover of Google's self-contained system and are really dependent on specialized programs, then you probably won't find much to like about it. But if you are all things Google and have no need for heavy, specialized programs like Photoshop, or intensive music production software, heavy 3-D gaming and the total Microsoft Office experience, welcome to the next thing in computing!By Eddie T", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Chromebook", "Author": "ChesterHartman", "ReviewID": "R2LAL7C6A8HM4P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For $199 the computer is a miracle.

I wanted something that I would almost only use for quick online tasks or surfing while watching TV.  This really fits the bill.  The start up time with the solid state drive and Chrome OS is sensational.  I used to be apprehensive to use a computer for any quick, menial tasks, but now I just reach from my Acer.  There are some items that take some getting use to.I have run into issues with Citrix because my company doesn't have the latest and greatest that comes with the HTML5 version.  The Chrome OS seems to lack some basic settings that I would like to be able to change.  For example, the Acer will turn on whenever you lift the screen.  It makes sense to do so, but it did take me some time to get used to it when I was just looking to clean the screen or keyboard.  And finally, as I am sure you know, the Chrome OS doesn't have the ability to install programs outside of the Chrome browser.  I knew this going in, but there have been a few times that I wish the OS could at least run very simple programs in an emulated environment.The Acer C720 looks stylish and isn't very flashy.  The keyboard feels a bit cheap compared to any other I have used, but you get what you paid for.  I was actually surprised to find a full-sized HDMI port that easily allows the computer to display on an external display like a monitor or HDTV.  I have actually used that feature more than any other, but having two USB ports that are on EITHER side of the computer is also great.It's exciting to use Chrome OS and the Acer C720.

For $199 at the time of my purchase, I could not be happier with what I got for my money. This 11.6\" laptop is great on battery life, has stellar performance, and houses a sleek and portable form factor. Chrome OS is limited to some, but with a constant internet connection and a computer at home that you can remote desktop to (not entirely necessary), there isn't much you can't do with a Chromebook. The dual-core Intel Celeron (Haswell) CPU inside isn't power hungry, it doesn't put out much heat at all, and it powers Chrome OS like a boss. The C720 also carries 2GBs of RAM, which is plenty for most of what you'll be doing inside of Chrome. You won't have any stuttering or lag with multiple tabs open in Chrome, a video playing or music in the background while blogging on social media. At the time of this review I currently have 6 tabs open, including a livestream on Twitch.tv, and there is no lag whatsoever. Battery life is also fantastic. With social media, email, music, and word processing, you can expect anywhere from 7 - 9 hours with the C720, slightly less if constantly streaming video. I had a day where I unplugged the laptop at 7am, used it for notes and videos through school till around noon, then used it all day at work researching tech and playing videos; I ended the day at 10pm with around 49% battery, I then proceeded to use the laptop most of the next day at home before it finally dying around 3pm. So you can expect to get through a whole day with this Chromebook. Another additional benefit is USB 3.0. There is 1 on this laptop, as well as a single USB 2.0 port on the other side of the laptop. You also have full HDMI out for running an extra HDMI enabled monitor/tv. This greatly improves functionality if you enjoy having multiple displays. It's lightweight, portable, looks great and the build quality is superb for a sub $200 laptop, but there are a couple downsides. The original carried a full-size SD card slot (when inserted, the card would be flush with the laptop, making portable storage easy), the C720 lacks this, and only carries a half-depth SD card slot, minor downside. Also, there are no function keys as well as no caps lock key, like the original. I would like to be able to ALT-F4 out of Chrome, instead I have to CTRL-W to close each tab/window individually. The screen is 11.6\" and has a resolution of 1333x768, which is just fine for a 11\" laptop. Viewing angles and color reproduction wasn't the best, but you won't have many complaints sitting in front of the laptop for a few hours. Another downfall out of the box was the keyboard, the keys were shallow but well spaced. After a couple days of use I got completely used to this and am now typing this review on the C720 at 60+ WPM.To conclude, if you're on a budget looking for a laptop, already live inside of Google's ecosystem or are okay with living in the cloud (no classic Windows applications/limited storage), then this laptop will serve you well.The C720 has the best battery life for a Chromebook on the market, other than Dell's Chromebook 11 ($100 more than the C720 at the time of this review),which only carries a couple hours of battery life over the Acer here. Other than that, you won't find better performance, battery life and a simple, utilitarian design in any other sub $200 laptop.Pros:PerformanceBattery lifePortabilityLoud speakersGood trackpad with easy-to-use gesturesCons:Screen viewing angles and colorsLack of caps lock key and F4 key. (Search key can be swapped with Caps lock in settings)Keys are a bit shallow and hard to use at firstIf you reading this feel I didn't cover some aspect of the laptop, feel free to ask a question on this review, I'm very active in replying to Amazon questions.

It was a little too big for me to lug around to my classes everyday, so I took a gamble and purchased this as a replacement.  There are apps for almost everything.  If you need to use Office, use SkyDrive and you can make Word, Excel, and PowerPoint online for free.  I strongly recommend this product.

It's not. At all. I find the C720 thin and sleek, and I like the graphite gray color that gives off a titanium vibe. Sure, the HP Chromebook 11 is prettier but you're foremost buying a computer here, not a piece of sculpture. As for the \"Jeez, you can (unlike the HP 11)  see the slotted vents and screws . . . and EVERYTHING on the bottom\" Yeah, you can. I know, because I checked. And that's the last time I looked down there. Seriously, how much time do you spend looking at the underside of a laptop? Why is this even an issue?Honestly, for me the \"refined industrial chic\" aesthetic of this little Acer is a plus.As for performance, it's, well, amazing. I find both the screen and speakers more than adequate. The screen, once you find the right angle on your lap or desk (which requires all of about 2 seconds) has rich colors, solid contrast and color saturation. I watched a couple of Netflix videos on it yesterday, also several YouTube vids, and they all looked . . . fine. No, not an Apple retina display. But it didn't cost me $1,200 either.  And, with an IMac G5 desktop and iPad, I am, and have always been, a Mac guy. And I still find this Acer immensely impressive and fun.The speakers, though expectedly thin on bass, are clear and resonant, though I do most of my listening via earbuds through which the Acer delivers superb, rich, and nuanced audio.But mainly, the C720 is SO fast. Pages load up almost as fast as you click on the link: BamBamBam. Even the laudatory reviews of the HP Chromebook 11 concede that its processor is paleolithic compared to that of the Haswell-driven Acer.Now, when it comes to computers, I am a certifiable cyber cretin. But within 10 minutes of unboxing the C720, I was zipping around with ease and confidence. Sampling videos, creating music playlists on Spotify, loading new apps from the store such as Planetarium, Pandora, and Old Time Radio, among others. There are still some tasks I need to figure out how to do, but I am now in my third day of use and am hugely enjoying my C720 experience.For $199, it's hard to even imagine a better, or more delightful, or more complete, package.", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great alternative to a Laptop", "Author": "golfman", "ReviewID": "R1UB2QVGTZL81O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can't say enough good things about this new Chromebook by Acer.

The hospital has public wi-fi which we attached to without a hitch.  We had a lot of fun with the Chromebook while there at the hospital.  I have been using it regulariy at home and find it very useful and fun. I connected to my Netflix account with no problem and seem to have flawless streaming.

First, when I ordered the 2 gb of RAM Chromebook, I thought I would be able to install 2 more gigs of RAM someday, myself.  Turns out that is not possible.  It is no one's fault but my own that I did not do enough research, still, it is disappointing (upgrading is fun).  All that being said, it turns out 2 gigs of RAM seems totally ample. I can have had multiple screens open with no problem.The second negative is that the chromebook does not connect to my home network.  Yes, it connects to my wi-fi, but otherwise it does not engage with any other devices via my router.  Not even the printer.  ( in the long run, there is a way to use your home printer, via \"the cloud\", which I have done).  It might not be fair for me to fault the Chromebook in this regard.

I don't know about other Chomebooks but this one is perfect for me and the family, we love it.It is very portable, its light weight and long battery life make it a go any where computer.

So in the past I would use my phone but then have to deal with mobile page versions or the regular webpage but the inconvenience of small print and some pages just don't work on the phone. The Chromebook solved all those issues, On average I turn this thing on 5-6 times a day.My wife the same, she loves the ease of use and the fact that she can create documents for work on Google Docs. and they are compatible with Microsoft Office, Word, Powerpoint and the other tools in Office. She uses social media websites with no problems as well.My daughter uses it for Youtube and for an online game Animal jam. it performs flawless for both. I also play on WGT.com on it with no issues.Some people complain about the screen resolution, I have no issues here. I watch Netflix and other videos on here.If you are looking for something to browse the internet, watch videos and create and edit documents with a laptop. This is the computer for you.

If you just want a simple, fast, secure computer that can manage nearly all everyday tasks at a low cost and virtually no maintenance, then the chrome OS is for you. Of course I don't want to give people the wrong idea, so if you are looking for a computer to use high end photo editing software, or play the latest games, then you are better off with a different OS. This all being said, I thoroughly enjoy having an OS that is so user friendly, quick, and has such a great interface, that I honestly would like to eventually see a \"Chromephone\" come to light.

I had intended to plug a 32GB card in more or less permanently, but that is not a practical option, unfortunately. The free 100 GB of Google Drive space (for 2 years), is a viable alternative for the SDCard, and the Chromebook is optimized to provide very direct and quick access to Drive, so it's very much just like having the space directly in the unit, as long as an internet connection is available.All in all, I would highly recommend the unit to anyone, as long as they understand what it is intended to do, and that it isn't a conventional app based, touch-screen tablet device.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Highly Recommend", "Author": "M", "ReviewID": "R29V957VXZEOZ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Chromebook worked perfectly for what we needed.

I conducted research before acquiring this, and although the low cost motivated me--I don't typically throw money around for kicks. This was a $200 well spent in my book because the Acer c720 is a useful tool. It would also be a huge step up from nothing for users can't afford a full fledged laptop, this to me, is revolutionary.Overview:It's not necessarily a laptop replacement, but it's better than a laptop in a few ways. The main strength of the Chrome OS is that it is very difficult to hack, and it is usually intuitive and fast to use. This could replace a laptop for someone who only checks their email and does not need a computer for anything apart than web browsing. It's light, inexpensive and operates as a computer for accessing one's google drive and online resources. Everything that it does is FAST, extremely fast for a computer with 2GB.Reasons why I bought it:I have a mac book pro, but after it experienced connectivity issues with my campus network I realized that I only used photoshop and other memory intensive programs at home. I now carry this chrome book with me because it is light, inexpensive and will allow me to upload files for class, type, check my email and visit facebook. It's a mobile computer which I use to submit assignments and can even do in browser programming for class. It's a chromebook dedicated for getting work done, if I need power I'll go home or elsewhere--with this I can't play games (a definite plus for productivity's sake) and feel motivated to work. I sometimes keep it open at home in order to check my email while I'm working on my computer. I also wanted a smallish computer that didn't run windows or android--this fit the bill.This works for me because if necessary-- there are plenty macs and pcs on campus if I need other programs. Also it's fine for anything that I might need to do in a coffee shop.Size: Small and light. I know average sized men who use it therefore the small size is not necessarily an impediment for average use, but the small size might also make it suitable for a child. When it's in my backpack I don't even notice that it's there.positives:+ 7 second boot up+ watching videos online is great+ Light+ 200 dollars is a stellar price for its size and functionality+ App store has note taking apps for class+ decent battery life (8 hours)+ FASTnegatives:- keyboard and track pad are average (use a usb mouse)The keyboard does not feel wonderful on my hands although it is certainly an attractive chiclet style board.- /+ offline functionality is not superb--average. Carrying a usb drive for backup might be useful for some people.- the slideshow part of google drive is unreliable, don't depend on it- Feels unsubstantial-- some people might drop it if they're not careful--it is very light, don't leave it near the edges of tables if you have a cat.Improvements:I would like a less \"grainy\" keyboard, a more comfortable track pad, skype and a full-ish microsoft office would also be great (but I knew this before I bought the computer). Perhaps having microsoft office would defeat the purpose of a chromebook? If it is offered in the future I'll try it though.Also, if something were to happen to my main laptop or it were in the shop (never happened) I could still have a screen larger and more comfortable than my ipod touch. For the price--this is a wonderful machine and I plan to use it until it no longer works.Recommended for:teachers, students, grad students, fans of chrome os, web browsing people, travelersCase suggestions: I bought the timbuk2 quickie case for this in XS and I'll probably review it when it arrives. I already have it for my 13 inch mac, therefore if it fits--I'll be very pleased. Although it might be a 200 dollar computer, I want to protect it from bangs and scratches, as well as have room for a mouse and the power cord.I recommend finding a nice mouse to use with this chromebook.+++ I't's also possible to run Linux OS as a dual boot on this chromebook. I'll write a sentence or two about this experience when I accomplish it.Feel free to ask me any questions about this chromebook and I'll be happy to answer them.", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Better than I expected", "Author": "Kenneth C.

With the end of support for XP I have a lot of companies who are looking at their options for their aging desktop replacements.  Linux is often mentioned as a replacement for MS products, but the market is fractured and no one distro seems to have risen to the top, so Apple and Google seem to be the only viable options for most mainstream users.  With new Windows based computers averaging over $700 per unit plus new software it's not an insignificant decision if you have to replace, say, 10 of your computers.I'm finding that more and more people use their computers primarily online anyway, so the \"limitation\" that Microsoft rails against in the \"Scroogled\" ads isn't particularly valid for many users; of course you can turn on \"Offline\" on your Google Drive and work on documents and email when your not connected.  With 100GB of Google Drive space for free for two years storage capacity isn't a problem for most people.  Photos can be placed on Google+ without eating into this 100GB limitation so that helps.The computer is very fast doing most things, depending on your wireless connection.  It boots almost instantly, opens local apps like the file explorer and video player instantly, and is light and seemingly sturdy; at least it feels sturdy in spite of the plastic case.  The battery life is quite good at about 8 hours of use and it charges remarkably fast.  The screen is OK, nothing amazing, but quite readable.  With the HDMI out you can easily plug it into a large monitor or TV.  It quickly recognizes the second display and you can easily use that additional display as a mirror or as an extended display.  This is not a gaming computer, but for HD video playback it is excellent when viewed on a large display.  Movie viewing on the internal display is quite acceptable as well, although the internal speakers are not very loud and the 11\" screen needs to be held pretty close to your eyes, but not much closer than a small desktop monitor.  Headphones overcome the sound problem if you want to use them.  It's own internal display has good viewing angles from side to side, but is quite sensitive to the horizontal tilt.  However the hinge is stiff enough that the display will stay wherever you place it, so I don't find this a huge drawback, but it could be better.  The keyboard is acceptable given it's size and I don't really miss the lack of the function keys, or you can plug in an external keyboard and mouse.  The internal storage is fairly limited but a 16GB USB flash drive like the SanDisk Cruzer Fit fixes this for very little money.So much for the physical part; how is it to use for work?  Well, pretty good, actually.  The cloud is incredibly convenient for those on the move, assuming you can find a wireless connection, which is more and more common, but most will use the Chromebook in their houses and/or offices.  The range and sophistication of apps is increasing at an incredible rate.  Many desktop functions like QuickBooks, AutoCAD, and office suites are now apps.  That's the good news, the bad news is that many of these apps are still not as sophisticated and feature rich as their desktop counterparts.  QuickBooks, for instance, doesn't let you customize your invoices nearly as much as the desktop version.  The biggest use for computers in the business world is, of course, office suites and Google Docs does a pretty good job, but still lacks many of the features of  desktop office suites.  For instance Excel or  OpenOffice Calc will let you format cells so the text can be angled, but Docs lacks that feature.  That said, Microsoft's own Office Online also lacks this feature along with other limitations.  However, the ability to work collaboratively from anywhere is great and if you work a Google Sheet or whatever, you can later use OpenOffice, LibreOffice or other software to tweak it later.So, is the Chromebook or a Chromebox at full fledged replacement for your aging XP?  No, not quite if you require a feature rich software package(s), but it's pretty close.  I have clients with perfectly good XP machines and they plan on using those machines until the computer fails, but they also realize that as of the 8th of April they will have to unplug those machine from their network and the Internet after moving much of their data to Drive and also backing up locally.  However their investment in the computer, in MS Office 2003, and in other software will continue to be useful as an adjunct to their Chromebooks.For under $250 this is an amazing little computer that will do most of what many people need.  Cloud computing is still in its infancy and as the power of apps increases so will the functionality of this type of computer.  One of the best parts is that you don't need a guy like me to fix your computer anymore; no more viruses, no more software updates, no more backing up your computer; it's all done by the pros, mostly at Google, so it's transparent to the end user.  Some folks worry about the security of their data, but I think that the whole business model of Google depends on them protecting your data so they invest millions into backing up the data and keeping it secure.  How much did you spend on the same functions over the last 5 years?  Less, I'll wager.Bottom line; if you're tempted, I say go for it, I doubt you'll be disappointed and will probably be amazed.  This is not the only Chrome device out there; I also recommend that you look at the Toshiba Chromebook with its larger screen or the ASUS Chromebox which should be out in March.", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "The Haswell processor makes all the difference.", "Author": "James M. Cook", "ReviewID": "RQV2GD4MV1UPE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I initially purchased an HP 11 Chromebook and while I was happy at first, I quickly realized it wasn't for me. If you only have a few tabs open at any given time, it's fine but if you're a \"power browser\" like me (and it's a hard habit to break), you will be disappointing. Hover over my username to read my review of the HP 11 and the following update.Now on to the review of the Acer. The Haswell processor makes all the difference in the world. This little Chromebook feels like I'm browsing with a Windows machine. In fact, it beats my roommate's $350 Toshiba with Windows 8 and 4GB ram. I can have upwards of 20 tabs open and stream music with no hiccups at all. True, the design isn't as stylish but I like it in a utilitarian kind of way. I think it of a workhorse and a great value for the money.The keyboard and trackpad is just as good as the HP 11 and while the screen doesn't pop as much as the HP, since it's matte it has the advantage of no reflections and being easier to clean. The fan is very quiet as well and the vents are on the back under the hinge. Much better that my last Windows laptop which baked my left hand. It gets a little warm but never hot. You also get a lot of ports. One HDMI port which I like because continuously plugging and unplugging a slimport into the micro USB on my HP worried me...micro USB is small and fragile compared to an HDMI port so I was afraid it would eventually break. A SD port is also included which is great because I store all my music on an SD card rather than uploading my 2700+ MP3 collection to Google drive or Google Play Music. At 512Kbps it would take forever (I live in the middle of nowhere and even libraries only have around 3Mbps upload speed). With the SD card, I just plug it in whenever I want to listen to music. You also get two USB ports but one is USB 3.0 so when I backup my documents, pictures and music It will come in handy. Even though all my documents and pictures are already in the cloud, I still make backups just in case.As far as the Chrome OS I won't say much since a quick Google search will tell you all you need to know, but as a formerpower user/Linux geek I am at the point in my life where I just want something basic, simple and that \"just works\" out of the box for a good price and the Acer C720 delivers this in spades! Keep in mind that the Chromebooks are for consumption first and production second (although I really like Google Docs) and you won't be disappointed. Also think of a Chromebook as a tablet with a built in keyboard, better speakers, and a bigger screen at a lower price point and you won't be disappointed. The apps (basically bookmarks in a menu although there are a growing collection of offline apps) aren't as extensive as Android but they are steadily growing. Another great thing about Chrome OS is that since most apps are web based and not installed locally, it's virtually immune to viruses and malware. That's one reason so many schools are switching to Chromebooks and why they are perfect for elderly or computer illiterate people. If you get your parents or grandparents one of these it will save you many headaches!On word of warning. If you want an HD Webcam, get the HP 14. This and most other Chromebooks have a VGA webcam that gets the job done but that's about it. It's not a big deal for me since I rarely use the webcam. Another thing is if you're friends and family don't have Google hangouts, they will have to get it in order to cam with you. I hear Facebook video chat works but haven't tested it. I've also heard that USB webcams work but again, I haven't tested it.In conclusion, if you consider yourself a \"power browser\" and have many tabs open at once, any shortcomings are blown away by the Haswell processor and the extra ports.

It's basically a browser on steriods. It's really fast and snappy because the operating system is so light that it doesn't take much to power it. The battery life easily holds 8-9 hours of solid battery life.When setting it up, the track pad seemed a little jittery and glitchy, but after I set all the settings and increased the sensitivity on it, it works just fine now. I think it might have to do with the software setting itself up for the first time so it takes more resources. I have had MANY tabs open at once and it doesn't show any signs of lag.

When I first heard of the chomebook I thought to myself, well that's quite dumb.  However after giving things some thought I realized I did ninety or so percent of the work on my computer on chrome anyway.  What I didn't do on chrome I did on Steam, the other fraction of a percent was photo editing from time to time and I wouldn't do that on a notebook anyway.So when I decided to get a small notebook thing for toting around and using in the bedroom, generally to watch movies and create some content with I fell into the Acer.  There are three Acer tablets in my family, the A200, the A210, and the A510.  All are still running flawlessly.  So I already had some respect for the brand.  I've had it for about two weeks, its performed much faster than any windows notebook I could get for under five hundred.  It's stable, stupid simple, and it does what I need it to do.So what do I do?  I stream movies from the big internet names as well as locally via plex, WHICH might I add works better on the chromebook than it does on my HTC one or A200.  I write, listen to music, well whatever you'd normally do on a computer.  I can spam out the same number of tabs on this as I do on my main machine without a slowdown.I consider the screen very good, the resolution is more than ample for this size and its sharp and bright too.  The viewing angles suck, but I have to have the screen way out for it to be an issue.The speakers are good, much better than my A200 and notably louder than I was expecting,  In my quiet room with the C720 on my lap I have the volume at 20% and its more than enough.Bluetooth works with my headset quite well, again no problems.The battery life is as stated around eight hours of run time which is plenty.A random quirk, the built in video player can handle some .mkv files with subs from the onboard storage, others it can't.  So keep that in mind, the onboard player isn't up to VLC snuff yet but plex can transcode those files just fine from my main machine.For the price it's really outstanding.  I suggest it.  Two gigs seems to be plenty, I was actually expecting it to be a dog, but alas tis not the case.

The rep told me it was impossible for the screen to crack without having some external force.

It syncs automatically with my Android phone. I was already a Chrome user on my Windows laptop (much faster and cleaner than IE), so that was no problem. Since I primarily use my Chromebook for email and web-surfing--both of which it does extremely well--I can accomplish most of what I want to do with my Acer resting (lightly) in my lap. And there are lots of free Chromebook apps available to do things such as play games, check the weather, etc.However...there are limitations, some of which I expected, but not all. For example, you can use Google Docs to produce, open, and work on Office documents, but you don't get the full functionality of Office, such as being able to to password-protect a document, or open a Word document that you previously protected with a password. This should not be a big surprise, since a web-based productivity application will probably never be as fully developed as a full-up suite of applications, though Google indicates they're working on the ability to open a password-protected document. Also, the web-based games (I'm somewhat addicted to Spider Solitaire as a mindless activity that frees me to think about stuff I need to do) just don't work as well or the same way, sadly.More surprisingly, I am unable to print easily (with Google Cloud Print) to my home network printer, a Brother MFC 490CW. The problem is that it is considered a \"classic\" printer, even though it's on my WiFi network, rather than a Cloud Ready printer. That means that in order to install the printer  so that the Chromebook can access it through the Cloud Print server, you have to open up Chrome on a Windows or Mac computer--not the Chromebook!--that is already connected to the printer. Again, no big problem for me, since I already run Chrome on my Windows 7 laptop. BUT...you can only then print from the Chromebook when the other computer (in my case the Windows 7 laptop) is on and online. Apparently the Chromebook sends the print command and data to the Cloud server, which then sends it to the other computer on the printer network, which then send it to the printer. That's a major irritation, since I don't want to keep the other laptop booted up all the time. BTW, you can check the list of available Cloud Ready printers at [...]Also, although it's not that easy to set up, installing the Chrome Remote Access App on your Chromebook AND your other Windows or Mac laptop really does allow you to access and use files and software on your laptop from your Chromebook.

This basically fits all my needs. When I announced I had bought a chromebook a few of my friends were disgusted. One said that \"all it does is run the internet\" and another said \"they break in no time\". To the second guy, I'm assuming he was talking about earlier chromebooks which I heard broke very easily. Everything I heard about this one before buying it said that it was much sturdier and did not break easily. To the first guy, I said well, that's all I really need.I really needed a new laptop and as a high school student my priority was speed, lightweight, thinness, efficiency, and for it to look nice. So I started looking into chromebooks and decided that this pretty much met those needs. I'm not really a hardcore gamer, and if I really need to play computer games there's always other laptops in my home to use. I love google chrome and chrome applications for their simplicity and ease. This gave me all that without other distractions. No need to worry about antivirus, no constant update reminders, no snail-pace start up, no overheating. Just so convenient. Obviously there are drawbacks of not being able to do all that you might be able to do with a traditional laptop but I'm willing to look past that. With my high school/artist's budget I don't really expect to make much and so don't really expect to be getting some high tech piece of machinery that works to perfection.The only problem I personally face is that my WiFi connection can be pretty s***ty, but that's not the chromebook's fault. Really, if my WiFi was out while I was on my old laptop I would pretty much have nothing to do except wait for it to come back. So why waste 300 extra bucks on something over priced and over large that I won't even use when I could have this for a much better price? Another thing I had to get accustomed to was the small size. I was expecting something a bit larger and I felt a little disappointed initially when I saw it, but I got over it pretty fast. Now when I use my old laptop or another \"regular\" laptop, it feels ridiculously large and awkward.

After some frustrating experiences with the trackpad (and as I was going out of town for a week) I decided to revert to Chrome OS just to have something to browse the web with during my trip. For doing just that, the machine is great, and works nearly flawlessly. Long battery life, quick and responsive, and quiet and cool. However, those benefits are also its drawbacks. If you plan to do any serious work, life gets difficult quickly. It's simply not made for those purposes. I eventually fixed all the issues I had with my linux installation, but still use Chrome sometimes. With linux the machine is great, and works just as a small laptop would.Chrome OS is the real limitation here, but for what many internet users do, I think this device is more than capable of meeting expectations. I would feel comfortable giving this to my mother, or a younger person as their own computer, knowing that they cannot really mess it up, nor would they be confused by the device (navigation is much more logical than say, Windows 8). Unless you fall into one of the previous categories, and even then it is unlikely, I would not recommend this as a main computer. As a portable device, that is less annoying to use for surfing the web than a smart phone, it does well.The main reason for docking a star is the build quality. Though the machine is thin and light, Mostly plastic casing makes the computer feel more like a toy than nicer laptops. In addition, the screen has poor viewing angles and the color is lackluster. Trackpad is small and lacks well defined button areas, sort of an attempt to recreate the apple trackpad gone wrong. I find myself tapping by not pressing down, but tapping on the trackpad, which I've never done until now. Due to the smallness of the laptop as a whole, the keyboard is not the standard size and lacks some of the more conventional keys (such as the delete key, which is more frustrating than you'd think). Overall, it was only $229, which makes up for many of the drawbacks. Someone who is looking for a very portable mobile web browsing unit, or someone who is a bit (just a bit, it's really not that hard) more savvy who is willing to install linux, would benefit greatly from this device.

I even find it comfortable for watching Netflix and Hulu+ and the like. Plus, it only weighs like two and a half pounds so it's really comfortable to use anywhere, even in bed.Nearly silent operation: You can barely hear the fans on this thing when the room is quiet. Much more pleasant than my old laptop which would rev up like a jet engine as soon as you hit the power button.Stays cool: Even when I set it on top of my blankets in bed, it doesn't get warm at all. The fans ventilate very well. It helps that this is a low power device I'm sure.Comfortable keyboard and trackpad: I was surprised how comfortable the keyboard is on this. I thought I was going to have to learn to adjust to a smaller keyboard, but the keys are sized and spaced well that anyone would feel comfortable typing on it. And the track pad is nice and large as well. The touchpad is also great. Very functional and responsive. I like that the whole pad clicks.ChromeOS: I'd never used ChromeOS before now, but I think I really like it now. It's perfect for casual computing. Lightweight and fast. Chrome is already my preferred web browser on the rest of my devices, so I couldn't go wrong.Surprisingly versatile: When I bought this I figured I would be using it for online shopping and browsing the web and not much else. Now I find I use it to manage documents and spreadsheets through the browser based versions of Word and Excel, manage files on my Google Drive, use AirDroid to manage my phone, and even use Chrome Remote Desktop to control my desktop.Cons:There's not much I don't like here. I don't like that the power button is kind of incorporated into the keyboard. I haven't accidently pressed it yet, but I'm nervous I might. Also, I wish they would've put a caps lock key instead of the search key. I never use the search key and would much prefer to have a caps lock key. Also, I don't know for sure but I don't think the device ever completely powers down. When I try to clean it, it always comes back on whenever I touch the track pad or sometimes (I think) other keys. A little annoying for cleaning.Conlcusion:This was one of the best purchases I've made in a while. I use this all the time and it's definitely a great value for the price.

I bought this for my dad since he's a senior and the old Windows Vista is getting to be a real pain for him to work with. I originally purchased a Samsung Chromebook (when it was first introduced) for him but found out the printing mechanism wasn't quite there. So I've been using this Acer Chromebook tonight and it's simply a joy to use!My setup with the unit is paired with my Google CloudPrint enabled printer, Epson WorkForce 845. Set up was easy enough. Since this unit is for my dad, I'm going to get him a low-end Epson Expression XP-410. It's only $69 on Amazon and it's a steal! One thing my dad does with his current printer is using it to scan documents and feed directly to his email. I don't think the Epson does it automatically but as a workaround, he could scan the doc onto a SD card or thumb drive, then un-mount it and stick it in the Chromebook. Not as direct but the process is quite straight forward. It shouldn't be a problem for him, albeit he's 83. :-) Go dad!!I also tested the VPN connection and it works flawlessly. I have a VPN service so I could watch BBC programs via the iPlayer. Previously I've been using my Nexus 7 and hooking that up to my TV via a SlimPort connection. It's a bit of a pain but using the Chromebook, the process is much more reliable. Bluetooth works as expected. I'm very happy with how far Chromebook has come, therefore I'll be getting my own unit next week! I was planning on getting the 32GB unit but decided not to since I ordered a 64GB SSD replacement. It's only $50+ and I think it's worth it. Was thinking about the 128GB but since I'll be utilizing Google Drive (with a free 100GB for 2 years); I think 64GB is plenty; at least for now.What needs to improve? Not so much the hardware but I wish the OS has the ability to save web pages on the Shelf, or in a folder or some sort. There's a workaround on doing that but the process isn't as simple. Certain keys are missing from a traditional keyboard standpoint, but I'll adjust. If you miss your Function Keys, there's a way that you can set up your keyboard to toggle them back. It feels a bit 'odd' not being able to save anything on the 'desktop'. It's different and I think I'm going to like it, a lot!Thanks for reading.UPDATE: I just read about where the Epson Connect website has an option where you could scan directly to your Google Drive.

It's not loud, it's just annoying when it keeps turning on and off.Things I am ambivalent towards and simply have to get used to:-I have turned this thing on like once since I got it because it turns itself on/wakes itself up every time you open the lid if it possibly can. That includes the very first time you plug it in which startled me a little.-there's not much available in terms of customization/options for stuff like when it sleeps/turns off the monitor, but there's not much I've felt the need to change in the first place-the keyboard labels are in all lowercase-I can't use the NotScripts chrome extension because I can't get into the program files to set the password, but seeing as the Chrome OS is supposed to be nearly immune to viruses I probably don't need to worry-there are no function keys, but the only ones I used were for refreshing and fullscreen, and there are keys for those-the caps lock key was replaced with a \"Search\" key but one of the customization options they do give you is the ability to change it back to a caps lock key so naturally I switched it right back-when I press the keys, they don't go down very far so I kept feeling like the keystroke couldn't possibly have registered properlyIf you spend a lot of time online and/or writing, a Chromebook is probably right for you.If you're into gaming, digital art, etc., you're better off getting a more conventional computer.", "Date": "April 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great all doer", "Author": "Emmanuel V.", "ReviewID": "R2L4YHPAX187KG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fast, fluid, great battery life and hassle free updates.

It's basically a little internet machine. That's it. It's not frilly. Not a lot of extra features, but it has everything I need. And the fact that I use google docs for everything means that I can print/access things from anywhere on campus (and the documents automatically save, which I love).This little guy is also super fast and can handle a very irresponsible number of tabs without getting hot or laggy at all. I've had 20ish tabs open (was writing a research paper) including netflix (*cough* needed a break) and there was still no noticeable lag and it didn't get hot, just a little warm. Also, it takes such a short time to boot up that sometimes I wonder if I even shut it down properly.Oh, and the tiny amount of storage really hasn't been an issue for me.

The easy-setup was just as advertised and the 7-second boot time is no joking at all, cool! It automatically checks for browser updates and there was no need to worry about dealing with register conflicts from various protection apps.

Rather than having a machine that slows down and demands more troubleshooting with time,  you have one that is getting better with each background update.There are some people who will need one of the traditional OSes for a while longer--certain professionals and gamers--but for the vast majority of users who are willing to try alternatives to their legacy programs,  the benefits of Chrome OS--speed, security, lack of frustrating technical problems--is well worth the switch.", "Date": "March 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "great laptop", "Author": "J.

Temple", "ReviewID": "R1PMN4Q1WT37GW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I want to give 5 stars, but for now I cannot.  I purchased the C720 on 2/8/14 and within the first 48 hours I experienced a few \"crashes.\"  I chalked them up as crashes and within the first week focused on finding a bad Chrome extension.  I eventually disabled all extensions but the issue still persisted.  About once a day I would experience a \"crash.\"The next step was to contact a Chrome Ninja who did some troubleshooting with me and eventually had me do a powerwash.  After trying this and sending some system data they indicated my Chromebook had been put in developer mode and that they could not help me.  This was interesting because a) it was a new Chromebook and b) while I know what developer mode is I certainly did not perform the steps at any time to enter into developer mode.  After explaining this to the Chrome Ninja he reviewed the information I sent again and said the Chromebook was no longer in developer mode but had been put in dev mode at some point in the past.  Given that, he said the only way for him to continue to assist was for me to do a full recovery of the machine.  No big deal, I made my USB recovery disk and completed the task and started over.After performing the recovery, the machine was still randomly \"crashing\" 1-2 times per day.  After the Chrome Ninja reviewed the latest system info he replied back and said I have a power issue and that I'd need to contact Acer for support/repair.  What I ignorantly wasn't realizing is that the Chromebook wasn't necessarily crashing, it was completely shutting down.  I should have realized that given that I had to press the power button each time it happened for the Chromebook to boot back up, but I just wasn't putting it together I guess since this is my first Chromebook.Now that I realized what was happening (thank you Chrome Ninja), I contacted Acer for repair since I had unfortunately purchased the Chromebook from Best Buy and I was past my 14 day return window.  At first, Acer wanted me to pay for shipping to their facility in Texas.  While I was annoyed they would even think I would pay for shipping (I told them the Chromebook was brand new and less than 30 days old) it was admittedly not that hard to get them to pay for the shipping.  I simply asked the Acer support representative and it took him about 5 minutes to confirm a free shipping label would be approved.  After a brief hold, he came back and said he was emailing me a shipping label.So, that's pretty much where I stand.  I have shipped my brand new Chromebook that I've used maybe a dozen times off to Acer for repair.  While I consider myself an understanding person, I'm quite disappointed that I'm now without my device for a period of time.  I can only hope that they actually repair it correctly and that the issue does not occur again.  Given the random nature of the issue, I'm skeptical at best.  I am hopeful though given the fact that there are so many positive reviews for this device I have to be an anomaly.I will update my review and rating once I get the device back from Acer.  If anyone else experiences a new machine that just randomly shuts down, don't wait until the return period is over... just swap it out for a new one immediately!UPDATE: 4/15/2014-----------------My Chromebook has been in repair with Acer twice now.  The first time, regarding the power issue above, they simply \"Reloaded OS\" and sent it back.  I had told them, more than once, that I had already done that and it didn't help.  After receiving the Chromebook back in late March, I began to experience the same issue of the Chromebook just randomly powering off on the very day that I received it back from repair.  So, I immediately called Acer support and they immediately, without trouble, sent me a shipping label (again) to send it back for repair (again).  After just 1 day of having the Chromebook back in my possession, I turned around and shipped it off again.I received the Chromebook back today, 4/15, with a note reading, \"Unable to replicate symptoms of the unit shutting down.  Unit remained powered on while streaming videos from youtube for more than 24 hours.  No trouble found.\"  Fair enough, but at this point I'm just waiting for the issue to happen again, at which time I will send it in... again.  Luckily, Google has been very helpful and they are helping me figure out what the issue is.  I just have to wait for it to happen again and they're going to analyze the data I send them from a feedback report.I'm trying to remain patient as I know my issue is difficult to replicate and is very random, but I would love to be able to talk to a more technical person at Acer to explain my issue as I believe things are getting \"lost in translation...\"  The other issue is I'm thinking it's battery related, and I would be the Acer tech left the Chromebook plugged in, and I've only experienced the issue while on battery power.Given the above...

When the first ever Chromebook was announced in 2010, I thought it was a stupid idea. A laptop built around only accessing the web? Why would anyone buy that when they can get a similarly priced Windows laptop? Fast forward several years, and Chromebooks have really hit their stride. The Chrome Web Store has really evolved with many apps also working offline (Nice try, Microsoft) and the pricing has gotten down to where I felt it originally should have been.In my opinion, the Acer C720 is the best value currently on the market. I do 95% of my work online, so a Chromebook just makes sense. Plus, since Google owns my soul, errr, I use many Google products, it works out well. I needed something that wasn't top of the line, but could get through a small to medium work load without bogging down under the pressure, and had great battery life. The Acer C720 has exceeded all my expectations, and while I was worried if 2GB of RAM was enough, it's been just fine for my needs.Pros:-Thin profile, feels solid.-Great keyboard for typing. Well spaced, raised keys.-Good, mostly accurate touchpad. Love the multi-touch functions to scroll, open a link in a new tab. Some complain about the touchpad, but I can tell you I've dealt with far worse.-USB 3.0 port, SD card support, HDMI out.-VERY quiet, barely gets warm even after hours of continuous use.-SSD makes boot up, opening files a breeze.-Fast charging.-Battery life lives up to the claims. I typically keep brightness around 1/3, and have gotten 6 hours on a full charge with over 20% of battery life to spare. However, like any other laptop, if you watch a lot of video, expect around half of what Acer claims.Cons:-Speakers are laughable, so make sure you have good headphones handy.-Despite having a matte finish, the screen isn't so great in sunlight. Wish it had a higher resolution, but for $199, I can't really complain!-Headphone jack requires a good amount of force to snap headphones in, but I assume this is to ensure they don't easily come unplugged.", "Date": "March 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Incredible value", "Author": "lucky one", "ReviewID": "RSHBO8QEG7DTR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading the reviews on many of the tablet-type computers and chromebooks I chose Acer's C720.

I wanted to be able to watch movies, browse the internet, and read Kindle books away from my desktop computer.

Around 8 hours doing less intensive tasks. (Office tasks, listening to music, etc).  *Note* - Disabling bluetooth, wireless when not needed, unplugging USB devices  and lowering screen brightness helps too.  *Boot - It boots fast (~7 seconds).######################################Here's what I think could be improved:######################################  * CromeOS - It's fast, simple, low resource, \"customizable\" though apps, automatically updates, it just works, so  what not to like?  It's bound to its google ecosystem, not very touch friendly yet, the apps are not as  complete as the alternatives yet, the offline functionality is limited, devices  recognition is limited too (USB printers mostly, you can set wifi printers though).  Though updates are frequent and the system improves each day.  *Note* - See the \"Aside\" section at the very bottom if you want to install a  different operating system on it.  * Microphone - It works but sometimes is hard to hear, the sound could be louder.  * Fingerprints - You'll see some around the computer because of the gloss finish.  * Graphics card/GPU - Sometimes videos and Skype skip frames, more noticeable when  using HDMI output.  For the price can't complain much tough.  * Ram - I wish the ram was at least 4GB or at least not soldered.#######Overall#######A very good deal, if your looking for a new basic computer or a replacement to your old one look no further.#####Aside#####  I installed Fedora GNU/Linux on the chromebook.

This isn't a big deal if you don't have apple products, but I have $600 of music on my account.  I also can't sync my phone/ipad on cloud with the chromebook.#2.  No gaming.

I don't mind this feature, I actually kind of LOVE google drive, but if you are looking for an office-type program....move along.#4.  You MUST have a cloud printer IF you want to directly print from Chromebook.  You can't print without a wireless printer, and one that works with google cloud.#5.  This Chromebook never wants to auto connect to my WiFi, and when it does it doesn't work correctly.  I have to disconnect and reconnect wo my WiFi service 90% of the time I open the browser.  This is a problem.  Very buggy.In short, Chromebook has a TON of potential.  I like it, but I don't love it.  I now wish I would have saved up a few hundred more dollars for a laptop.IF you are looking for a web browser with keys, this is fine.

Since purchasing my C720 several months ago, it is the thing I reach for when I want to process my email, search the web, or work on any of the increasing number of web-based applications I use. In addition, I maintain several servers using the fine 2X Remote Desktop Client on my chromebook. This (I am using it right now) thing is as light and small as my Nexus 10 in its keyboard case, but so much better for everything that requires even a little typing. The only thing I still do on the tablet is watch Netflix and read e-magazines on Zinio. It is pretty much the same thing with my current laptops (and HP 12\" touchscreen model (weighs twice as much as the C270) and a 15\" i7 that I use as a backup server and for programming. I spend far more time using the chromebook than either of these other portables. So, although technically the chromebook is a supplementary device, it is the one I use most. In all fairness, I should add that my business uses Google Apps for Business, so the chromebook is a great fit in that regard, but Chrome is such a good browser that I think it would work just as well if we used Office 365 instead. I can't believe that this machine was only $200.Features: Time to get into the system to start using it is as fast as anyone could ask for, and less than the 15 seconds that I have read in various reviews, whether starting it cold or waking it from sleep. In that respect it feels more like my phone or tablet than my computers. The keyboard is solid with good action. I can type as fast as with any other keyboard I have. It would be nice to have a higher resolution screen, but it is good enough, and the brightness is absolutely fine. Although I really have not found it necessary, I leave a tiny 64 GB flash drive plugged in all the time, in case I suddenly need some off-line storage. Oh, that reminds me of my one gripe. The SD slot is very shallow, so if you insert an SD card, most of the card sticks out. That means it is good for copying stuff onto or off a temporarily inserted card, but you really can't leave it in there or it will surely get broken. Anyway, no biggie.

Still really like the idea of a chromebook however i'm experience problems with mine. It randomly shuts down. I've posted in googles chromebook forum but haven't gotten an answer that helps. I've ran a Chrome OS recovery which installs a fresh copy of Chrome OS on your computer. It shut down 5 mins after that. I thought maybe it was overheating on my lap - covering the exhaust port and fan but it shut down on a table a couple days ago and last night in the middle of a movie. Both time the vents were completely clear. Have read 2 other reviews that have this problem. Might just be faulty hardware and I got an unlucky one. Not sure but I will have to take this back. Don't know if I will purchase another.This is my first chromebook. If you know what a chromebook/Chrome OS is capable of will not be disappointed.I've been using it for a couple days now so I'll give you a breakdown of what I like about itScreen- 11.6 is alot smaller than I'm used too. That being said its not a bad trade off for the portability of this device. Its a TN screen so colors are not that great but also not bad, I've seen 400-500 dollar laptops with worse screens. I compared the chromebook with the ISP panel and it was so much nicer of a screen but I did not like that chrome book. I actually like the matte screen. My last 2 laptop were glossy so I thought i might not like this one but thats not the case. Remember the price of this laptop I can't complain at all about the screenHdmi out - I've hooked this up to my 55\" samsung tv via hdmi. The picture was amazing. Just make sure you don't choose mirror displays. that will send the 1366x768 image to the tv. Choose the other setting and it will send a full 1080p signal to your screen. I tested playing movies from either usb port, the sd card, and the actual hard drive on the computer and all worked perfectly.Webcam- just average. In good lighting its a decent image. Medium light starts to get grainy. Low light pretty bad.Audio- sounds great with headphones, speaker volume is more than enough with my Grados. Built in speakers are very good as well, better than my last 2 laptops which is odd since the speakers here are on the bottom.Battery life - have been getting 7-8 hours just as advertised. I really find this incredible, my past laptops were 3 hours at mostwifi- works great. I needed an ethernet port which this did not have. I purchased a usb to ethernet adapter from amazon. It was cheap and works perfectly. Tried it in both usb ports and is automatically detected and worked in both.Sabrent USB 2.0 to Network 10/100Mbps Ethernet Adaptersd/usb ports - all work and quickly, dont' have any usb 3.0 devices to see how much quicker the usb 3 is.keyboard- i like the small keyboard. can reach any button easily while typing. doesn't feel cheap. the full screen button and the buttons around it are a little \"clicky\". There is some flex in that area of my laptop which causes that sound. If I push down slight on the plastic above those keys they sound just liek the rest. The tiny flex in the plastic is what is causing the sound , the keys work fine.  Some buttons are gone from a regular laptop or keyboard but there are short cuts to each of these missing keys. Just have to look them up - example no delete button but alt+backspace functions as a delete button.Trackpad- is sensitive and responsive. Click feels solid, but i find that i really click anymore just tap it. Since the laptop is small the track pad is on the small side. Sometimes when I'm scrolling down I run out of track pad. I just have get used to it and two finger scroll a little quicker and then it brings me to the bottom of the pages i'm reading.So for 199 I really think this is an amazing machine. If you know what Chrome OS is capable of then you won't be disappointed with this.  At first I didn't know how I would manage without downloading the programs I have on windows but it seems in this day there is a web based program for everything you need to do.My only issue is Toshiba just came out with a chromebook CB35-A3120. It has a 13.3 inch screen (supposedly better colors, glossy screen). Two 3.0 usb ports. It is 279 plus tax so its almost 50% more than this model.

I've never owned a chromebook, but I'm so glad I purchased this.Benefits:* Speed - connects to WiFi instantly and runs all web-based tasks as good as my desktop PC.* Instant boot up* Immediate access to Google Drive, Google Email, etc.* Lightweight* Battery Life (8.5 hours)* Quick charge time (charged very quickly from 82% to full today when I received the product)* Chrome Remote Desktop -- this app allows me to connect directly to my desktop PC (which has Windows 7).  The app works very well, and this essentially means that I HAVE FULL ACCESS TO WIN 7 WHENEVER I WANT!Zero cons at this price.  This is now going to be my little workhorse computer.Acer has really hit this one out of the park.**UPDATE #1**I've been using this for a few days now.  I'm still very impressed with this machine.  I really cannot state how great the battery is:  I literally went through almost 2 full days of use with this on a single charge (not continuous use, but off and on for hours at a time for the entire two days).I also earned 100 GB of free Google space - bringing my total Google Cloud space up to 130 GB (all for free).I've been speed-testing the WiFi.  The machine achieves excellent speeds (same as my desktop PC).  This may be standard nowadays, but my cell phone and other laptops I've tried often have a slightly inferior WiFi connection.  So I'm happy to report that this thing achieves full speeds over WiFi (and really connects almost instantly to it).There are a few things I dislike, but it's not with the machine itself.  Google Docs is missing a few features that I would have assumed standard (e.g., no ability to use a section break).Also, I really like Google Chrome Remote Desktop, but there is one issue with the screen flickering when I try to stream StarCraft 2 on my chromebook.  I'm not sure what the reason is, but it may have to do with my desktop PC having two monitors (dual screen).  Not quite sure yet.  Otherwise, Google Chrome Remote Desktop is brilliant!One thing I noticed:  If you have multiple email accounts with Google, you'll need to create a separate user to access them.  It's not a bad thing, but it is a necessity.Another thing:  There is no \"delete\" key on this keyboard.  That may be standard on laptops, but I used that key all the time on my desktop PC (and I miss it!).In sum, I'm still very glad I purchased this Chromebook.  People try to ding things by saying the screen is of poor quality, or that the keyboard is bad, etc.  I DO NOT agree.  The screen looks great to me, and the only thing I can say about the keyboard is that it's a little smaller than a full-sized keyboard (standalone).  But I can type on it just fine (as I'm doing now).All in all, a terrific machine at a terrific price!  Still 5/5 for me!I'm getting ready to travel across the country for approximately 2 weeks.  I will post another update on my experience using it on the go.  Cheers!**Update #2**I'm on holiday and recently flew from Ohio to California with a connection in Texas (American Airlines flights).  GoGo in flight WiFi worked and it was FREE!A few things:*It only worked from Texas to California (no service from Ohio to Texas)*The overall speed was very hit or miss.  One second web pages / music would be loading decently, and then it would come to a grinding halt.  This was, admittedly, rather annoying.*When I had no connection, I noticed that I could still make changes to files I had stored in Google Docs.  For some reason, these files would still open even though I had no internet connection.  I'm very baffled by this, but it's an incredible plus.  Basically, all the changes I made were synced once the connection resumed.  This is an AWESOME feature because it allows me to work despite the lack of an active connection.Other general thoughts:*The speed of this chromebook is incredible.  A particularly nice feature is the boot-up time.  If you open the chromebook, it resumes instantly.*Again, I have to comment on the wicked good battery life.  I cannot remember the last time I charged this device, but I can tell you it was BEFORE I left for vacation, which translates to about 5-7 days.  This is with full time usage during my flight (several hours) and also moderate usage before and after the flight.  As of right now, after about a week of light / moderate use, I've got 22% battery life / about 2 hours left.  WICKED GOOD BATTERY LIFE!*A pleasure to travel with due to its slim and lightweight design.I was hoping I'd be getting some more work in during my trip, but we all know how that goes.  I will post another update again in the future.Still 5/5.**Update #3**I've had a few more thoughts since my purchase.  First off, still love this machine in pretty much every possible way.A minor downside, at the moment, is Google Chrome Remote Desktop.  First off, the app works great FOR THE MOST PART.  However, certain tasks / applications ARE SLOW.  The trouble is that I have not figured out a way to fix this issue.  I'm not sure if it's a hardware issue, a software issue, or a bandwidth issue.  I've tried reducing my color depth and eliminated all visual enhancements on the Win 7 machine, but it hasn't fixed the issue.I dug around and it turns out that Google seems to be aware of this issue, suggesting that I'm not the only one experiencing this and also that they are currently working to resolve the performance degradation during Chrome Remote Desktop.The best way I can describe the performance issues is this:  Laggy.  The cursor will sometimes lag behind, typing will sometimes be delayed, and applications will stutter a bit.  It seems to get worse depending on where I am using my chromebook, which makes me suspect that it might be a bandwidth issue.  Of course, I'm not 100% sure and it may be a combination of things.  I do hope that they resolve the issue sometime soon!Otherwise, nothing majorly new to report at this time.  It's still a workhorse bargain of a machine as I outlined in my previous reviews, and it's most certainly still one of the best electronics / laptop purchases I've ever made (if not THE best computer purchasing decision I've ever made!).**Update #4**Quick tip:  To avoid the loud mouse click when using the trackpad, push down slightly above the left mouse key.  The button will not depress, and thus will not make noise; yet, if you find the sweet spot, you can successfully click the mouse!  :)I also wanted to say that my GoGo WiFi was much better on my return flights (previously, it was kinda slow and in one leg not even available).Also, Google Chrome Remote is great in terms of reliability, but needs to be updated for better speed.  Also, when using Chrome Remote in full screen mode, a really annoying display box telling you you're in full screen mode pops up whenever you hover your mouse near the top of the screen.  This is really ANNOYING and should be eliminated!", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Why Not?", "Author": "Budget Uke Buyer", "ReviewID": "R1AJE8LE0CPNOE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Considering how many things you can't do on a computer without an internet connection these days, I don't know what there isn't to love about this Chromebook. I'll admit, the smaller form factor has taken me a few days to get used to but that's a minor adjustment I'm quickly adapting to. I can't believe how well Netflix runs on this baby.

And here we are!I am not really much of a laptop guy, I have a ridiculously expensive pc, with a filco cherry brown mx keyboard, and gaming mice, etc. So why did I decide to buy a chromebook? Well, I am a student, and I didn't want to go home after class every single day just to do hw or wait for class (and god knows, I won't study once im in that gaming environment i created). So I looked to find a way to help me stay focused - at school. And bam, a fast pc that cant play games but can work very well on the browser. And furthermore, google made it! Expecting quality out of em.And quality I received. Everything I love about this except for a few minor thingsGoogle Slides is trashcan for viewing microsoft PPTs. It is always in some shape or form corrupted. Not even worth my time. So I recommend having a power house computer at home. What I did was download the app Chrome Remote Desktop, and Set it up to my desktop at home. Then, if i need to look at ppts for class, i simply sync to my computer at home, and download the ppts and view them. It's pretty witty i gotta say. But anyhow, The screen is pretty small imo, but its workable once you get used to it (2-3 days) And the keyboard is hard to get used to for the first 2 days or so. I just played a bunch of typing games for an hour or so and went form 60 wpm back to my avg of 90 wpm. Definitely a good keyboard once you get used to it. The trackpad is a bit rough at first. Felt a great deal of friction at first, but once you use it enough, your hand oils will seep into it and make it smoother and easier to use. Trust me.Also, before buying this, spend some time learning to use google docs. Since switching over is a big change. Also, i dont like the Search function instead of Caps Lock, thank god you can change it. So I did. Im worried about it getting scratched, so i bought a cover case, \"Aqua iPearl mCover Hard Shell Case for 11.6\" Acer C720 C720P series ChromeBook Laptop\" It looks really nice with it on too. Plus, it has 2 lifters on the bottom of the case so you can elevate your chromebook as a whole to type if you prefer.Fast load time. Easy to use. Great machine. Tbh, it's very fun because of how interestingly new this concept is to try to put on for a laptop.Tl;DrBest specs for cheap chromebook, Fast, L2Use Google Docs b4 buying, Use Chrome Remote Desktop to use your actual computer away from home, invest in a case.EDIT: 1 Month LaterMy problem with viewing ppts was solved after i found out using google drive viewer instead.I love google docs now, been using the google cloud system a lot more now that I can really use it and take it with me everywhere. The keyboard is pretty good, i get about 89-104 wpm on it, and on my filco cherry mx ninja majestouch 2, i get about the same.I am very glad I bought a case for my c720, because I can already see all the scratches on it even though all I have been doing is putting it in my backpack.

This is my first chromebook, and I use it as a secondary laptop in addition to my MacBook Pro. Here I list several pros and cons from my 3-day experience:Pros:1. Battery: I am very surprised that the battery lasts so long compared to any PC or MacBook, probably even longer than advertised. Also it charges very fast.2. Style: Before I got this chromebook, I thought maybe its style is not as attractive as the new HP 11. However, I completely changed my mind when I opened the box. The Acer C720 has a very nice looking outside, and the weight is very light.3. Apps: There are so many apps in the Chrome Store that meet all my needs.4. Sound: The speakers are pretty good. For running multiple tabs, you hardly hear any noise from the inside of the chromebook. Very quite.5. Remote control: Make sure to check out the Chrome Remote Desktop (or alternative apps). It is pretty easy to get control of my MacBook Pro. You just need a PIN number to get the access.Cons:1. Skype: I knew beforehand that Skype is not supported in Chrome OS. I do hope that there could be a Skype app in the near future. Though Google Hangouts is awesome, some people may still want to have Skype at hand.2. Touchpad: when I click on the touchpad, I hear a crispy sound that I dislike. That sound may make the chromebook feel \"cheap\" in quality, but that is the only aspect that I am a little disappointed. Again, for the $199 price, I should not ask for more and more :)Overall, I highly recommend this Acer C720 chromebook to those who are considering a secondary laptop besides the working computer.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Outstanding piece of technology", "Author": "Seth J Danneman", "ReviewID": "R246UEUDRW5YI8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just an amazing piece of technology.

The Acer C720 seems to fit the bill just right.I have only had it a very short time, but I can see why Chromebooks are being used more and more folks around the world. Considering so much of what we do every day on our computers exists online and in streaming format (netflix, facebook, twitter, online shopping) there isn't need for every computer in the house to be able to edit and store a ton of photos and games and music (though with the minimal storage built into the C720 you have room for at least some of what you would like to have close at hand).I needed a backup laptop to head to work and school with me, and this fits nicely into my bag.

The only thing my laptop has been used for in the past couple years is letting my daughter watch youtube videos or play games on PBS's web site. I also occasionally surf the web and maybe once in a while do a video chat/Skype.With those requirements in mind, I wanted to get the cheapest laptop I could find. I am not a big Windows 8 fan (my now-dead laptop was running Linux) and of course Macs are too expensive, so I started looking at Chromebooks. To be honest this was the cheapest one I could find with decent reviews, and at only $199 I thought I'd give it a try.I'm pretty impressed with ChromeOS as a whole. It boots very quickly, and this C720 has a good battery life (4 or 5 hours with youtube watching). The screen quality isn't the best but the resolution is acceptable. As you would expect, pretty much everything is based around Chrome and it all works pretty well.One thing that is a downside of ChromeOS and not this particular product is that since everything revolves around Chrome, any Chrome extensions you install have the opportunity to mess the system up pretty good. After a couple weeks of really poor performance after installing (and uninstalling) some extensions, I did a system restore (which was very easy/fast from the menu). After that, I just didn't install any extensions and it has been working great ever since.The device is really light and easy to carry around. It doesn't feel exceptionally sturdy..

With vim and ShiftEdit, I even do a good chunk of Web development with this computer. I still take video editing and rom tinkering elsewhere, but this little guy is great for just about everything else I've thrown at it. The built-in terminal works fine, and there's enough storage space for transferring materials around. Certain tasks are still a little rough around the edges (working with zip files could be smoother, for example), but overall, I'm more surprised by what I CAN do on the Chromebook, rather than the other way around. If you are the \"tech support\" family member and need to suggest a consumer laptop for a less technical family member, the Chromebook could be a godsend for you and for them. You'll need to convert Microsoft Office use to Google Drive use (works fine for me, but I don't really created sophisticated layouts. Chrome's Excel replacement is really quite good now, with much better formula options), but other than that, I think most computer users would be foolish not to consider Chromebooks. The price alone makes them worth a look and with Haswell in them the battery life is great. A few things to keep in mind: wifi must be reliable, new users need to be patient and develop easy (but possibly different) workflows, you may need to search a bit for extensions in the Chrome store to replace a few Windows/OSX functionality, and it may be easier to buy a newer printer for use with Google print if you need to print a lot. I'm quite pleased with this machine and I would not be surprised if ChromeOS ends up as a new Windows in terms of widespread use. With its cloud-first leaning and the ease with which users can switch computers (even to other operating systems with the Chrome browser installed), it's really a great choice for mobile workers. It also really lends itself to use in schools, so the next generation will be well-versed in its functionality and well-aware of its budget-friendliness... a great take-to-college machine for students on a budget.", "Date": "May 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Chromebook", "Author": "William R.

The device is light and quite thin. However, Chromebooks still have a lot of features missing. Printer support is where I encountered a serious lack of functionality. If you have an Android phone, you can send your print jobs to it, as Android has good driver support from printer manufacturers.Trying to access your printer directly via Google Cloud Print is useless, unless you have a Windows computer running all the time, with a printer attached to it.Another problem that I encountered was finding a good calculator program. Chrome OS has a very basic calculator, but if you want to calculate anything more than basic math, then you either have to get a full-blown scientific calculator from the Chrome Web Store, or calculators that are really buggy. Very frustrating, as all I needed to do was calculate percentages.One final issue that I had, was that I had to use my Google account password as the device password. That required me to dumb down my password, so I could remember it. Normally I have a password manager create a complicated password and then sign in to my Google account using the manager. Why Google choose this method when Android allows you to create a device password is a mystery to me. Apparently, Google thinks you will only be accessing their services on a Chromebook!When it comes to using Google services and accessing the web, this Chromebook really shines.

My Windows 8 laptop from Gateway suffered a sudden screen-break and was no longer usable. I had to have a computer, so I went out and bought this at OfficeMax, as it was the same price as on Amazon. I figured I would be able to browse the web, check email, and write papers. I wasn't expecting much more than that, but I that was all I needed at the time being. I soon found out that this little Chromebook could do much more than that.On my old computer I would download music from online (hip hop mixtapes mostly, which aren't always available through iTunes or Google Play) and then upload it to my Google Music account, so I can access the music anywhere. To upload music on WIndows 8 you need an actual program downloaded from Google. I assumed that since Chromebook doesn't support traditional programs that I would no longer be able to download or upload to the cloud. However, after downloading an album that came as a .zip file, I found that there are browser-based unZIP software, as well as programs to download torrent files, and you can upload music via the browser.This thing is great.

It's fast and reliable, incredibly lightweight and fairly easy to use. I recommend it highly as a portable second computer for a moderately tech-savvy person. I wouldn't recommend it to someone as an only computer or to someone who isn't comfortable occasionally googling around to figure out a problem.My biggest complaints are not reasons to avoid purchasing this Chromebook, but things I'd wish I'd known prior to my purchase. While the apps available through the Google Play store are overall very helpful, switching between non-Google file types can be tricky. Mostly for me that's dealing with Windows documents, such as .docx. I've also had some trouble with media files, especially video and sound, that I'm still trying to sort out. Streaming works well, but opening previously downloaded files is not so simple.The biggest criticism I've encountered in about a month of ownership is just how flimsy the hardware is. It's something a few reviews mentioned, but it didn't really jump out at me until I got my own. About two weeks after I bought my Chromebook, my medium-sized dog bumped it off the table and stepped on the (closed) Chromebook. It booted up and works absolutely fine, but the upper-left hand corner of the screen is a grey block and there's a weird green line running down the screen. I would definitely recommend buying the purchase protection plan for this laptop. I am filing a claim with my credit card in hopes it'll be covered.I might be slightly biased because my ASUS K50 is an absolute tank and has weathered a lot more damage in 6 years of ownership. It also weighs 6 times as much, which is why I upgraded to the Chromebook.Still, I like this machine a lot and I'd buy it again.

No sound, no sign of a fan running, no glitches.  Just smooth as silk...  it seems like it's not really \"on\", it's that quiet!Fast.  Fun.  Keyboard is a little smaller than I'm used to, but it's big enough to very, very easily get used to, and to actually USE.Can't think of a thing I don't like about it - the price is great.  Has the HDMI port so I can simply hook my HDMI cable from CB to TV (both, obviously, have the HDMI ports, otherwise it wouldn't work!). So right now I've rid myself of NASTY Dish Network (I say this because they treat their employees like garbage, and I'm being generous with this comment...)  Yes, Dish has ok technology.  So do their competitors, plus if you have high-speed internet, you can access everything that way.  So forget about paying the outrageous fees for being able to watch a wide variety of shows & movies.  Use the internet - Hulu Plus, Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc. and pay a nominal monthly fee and watch shows/movies whenever you want.Love this Chromebook.  Very glad I finally purchased it.  It's very thin & sleek.  Lightweight.  And it's built very well - not flimsy, not cheap feeling.  It's sturdy and super light.

The whole computing experience is even better than the Android tablet.  Don't get me wrong - Android on my phone is wonderful but when it comes to a larger device, where I tend to do/expect a little more, this Chromebook more than surpasses expectations.Chromebooks offer a computing experience, in my opinion, that closely mirror what one is already familiar with in a traditional PC environment - operation of the hardware, software functionality and overall familiarity make for a small learning curve.  I really also like that you can work offline with it - to an extent.  I've used it only once offline and that was to continue working on a document - it was a success.The Acer C720 is overall well designed.  It is thin, lightweight and they keyboard is comfortable to use - especially those of us who are old-school typists :) .  The screen is fine enough - this is at basic hardware and thus you have to expect some areas to be cost cutting.  However, the whole package makes for a great experience.Google is only going to improve the Chrome OS and these devices are going to continue reaping the benefits of those improvements.  Matched to Acer's hardware design and low-cost, they have a hit.  I can see why Chromebooks are picking up in popularity - lightweight, fast, easy to use and reasonable price now brings computing closer to what people as me want.

I may do a duel boot setup and keep crome, if you decide to do this I would make a full backup of the stock OS just in case you do want to revert back with ease.Note the 8 hour battery life is due to the processor underclocking itself if you do something process intensive like playing a video game for example you will not get anywhere near that", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "GREAT CHROMEBOOK", "Author": "D Tab", "ReviewID": "RDVCOU5OH6QJQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was intentionally for my 11 yr old son for school, but with our computer giving us problems my wife and I have loved this little chromebook and thinking about getting another for our personal use and business she has, we still haven't gotten a printer, but probably will in the near future, highly recommended!!!", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great product.", "Author": "Scott Nuelken", "ReviewID": "R1SB8R7QU2204H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay, it is a chromebook. aren't all chromebooks pretty much the same?

Buying any other Chromebook under 12\" would be a mistake.I've owned the Samsung Series 3 Chromebook and the difference between these two machines is astronomical in terms of performance. When comparing speed, snappiness, and quickness in loading pages, the C720 is the hare to the Samsung's tortoise. Most websites load just as quickly as they do on my MacBook Pro Retina 13\", and once the website is completely loaded, scrolling up and down quickly doesn't hang it up at all. The Samsung's ARM processor is sluggish and there really isn't a comparison. Unacceptably for a modern machine that is supposed to give you the \"best of Chrome\", the HP Chromebook 11 has the same processor as the Samsung from 2012 and the performance is not much better.Trust me - nothing is more frustrating than waiting for websites to load, and a close second pet peeve is poor performance, lagginess, and abrupt jerkiness when navigating around a page. You will get none of that on the C720. In this day and age, I need the internet to work immediately and reliably. The use of the older ARM processor is a huge oversight by HP and something they shouldn't have skimped on.The Samsung and the HP definitely win in the looks dept., but the C720 isn't an ugly computer by any means. People moan about its design, but it's quite easy on the eyes when you see it in person. Pictures don't do it justice. The metallic gray is pleasing and the shiny bezel around the display is reminiscent of Apple's design choice, which I prefer to the matte black bezel of the Chromebook 11. The C720 is also very light and feels quite sturdy in the hand despite being made of lower cost materials. The keyboard is good enough to use, even though the keys do feel slightly \"mushy\", but they haven't caused me any significant errors or slowdowns so far.You really can't complain of much when spending $199 on a computer.

I got an audio system  (Yamaha receiver and JBL tower speakers) at home, and I wanted to hook this system up via Wi-Fi, so I could listen to Spodify music. This Acer C720 works really nice with the system, just connected with a HDMI cable, and yes, unlimited online music of awesome quality is mine.2. The boot time is only a few seconds, instead of 2 or so minutes on my desktop and my other \"regular\" laptop.3. Wifi connection to a public provider (say, at a McDonald's)  is also extremely fast, Too fast and too easy, indeed. Waaaaay faster than a tablet.4. Battery life is amazingly long. I don't carry the charger and the power cord at all wherever I go.The so-so (not the bad):1. The screen is decent, not bad or ugly at all. It is not nearly as good as the Samsung Galaxy Note 3's screen. But I don't care!2. I wish the keyboard had more keys, like PgUp and PgDn.3. The wi-fi streaming has hiccups occasionally.

Integration with Google accounts is seamless. I can use it for business (at least most of it) and when it's not in use for that, anyone can log on and I have no worries about cross contamination or it getting bogged down. It's lightning fast - not the prettiest chromebook available, but I have no complaints about how it looks. The extra horsepower and battery life far outweigh any vanity issues I have.Where computers, traditional laptops, and tablets fail, the chromebook shines.

I have been a Chromebook fan since the early days and find this a great entry level unit.Pros:-Great battery life (real world 6-7 hours)-Faster then Samsung or HP Arm Processor-Small and light-They improved on color and design slightly (less plasticy- more metal looking then 710, but still wish it was more premium)Cons--Screen (both in quality, and size). Now realize I might be a little biased on this one. I have a few of the Samsung Arm Chromebooks for the kids, and I own a Chromebook Pixel. I recently bought a Mac Air (to do more developer things), and had to return it because the screen just does not cut it for me (after using the Pixel). I got a Macbook Pro to find the screen to my liking. So if you are coming from any retina type screen, this will be harder to adjust to. Otherwise, what more can you ask for in a $199 notebook.-Design is still a little on cheap end, too large of bezel-Speakers have OK volume, but Bass is distorted at higher volumeSuggestions (not specifically for this model, but Chromebooks in general):-ACER (or Asus, Samsung, or Toshiba - you still have a chance to surprise us in early 2014), there IS a market for a little nicer unit. This is what I would change on this (and any lower end chromebook).1) The bezel is a little too large. Seems they could of pushed 12.1 or 12.6 out of same form factor by reducing bezel.2) Go IPS, HP 11 is a beautiful screen (too bad they couldn't of put a Haswell in that one).3) Love the Micro USB charger of the HP 11 (although not sure if that was part of recall of that model).4) Must be Haswell type power with 8+ hours of battery life5) Must be under 3 lbs.6) Sound through keyboard7) Backlit keyboard8) Metalish look please, and sturdy frame. Not a huge fan of the polished plastic look that HP went back to in the 11. Reminds me of the first series 3 Samsung I owned. Maybe even going leatherish feel with aluminum trim (like the first Nexus 7) gave off a professional look while keeping costs lower.While I understand almost 2 of every 3 units going out the door is for education, you would like to see one company step up to make a in-between model. For those of us that own the Pixel, we are disappointed in a battery that cannot perform past 3 hours making it almost useless in some cases.

I am actually writing this review on it. It is AWESOME. It's really light, and thin, so it can be stored easily. Two things I LOVE about it: the screen quality, and the sound quality. The sound is perfect. It's clear as crystal, and rivals the Dolby Digital 5.0 speakers on my Kindle Fire HD.  The Video quality is terrific, I always test that out by watching the Longmire season 2 trailer, and it was as clear as watching it on an HD TV. I'm only going to use this computer for writing, school work, music, and very little internet use (research, shopping, and the like).The screen is 11.6 inches, as the page shows, and, as I said, the screen resolution is Perfect (1366x768, 720 pixels). Now, for such a low price you may be thinking that this is a cheap piece of crap. It's not. It's a very firm little computer. There are two USB ports, and one USB 2.0 port. The computer has no Microsoft or Apple software, just for those of you who were wondering, it's all Google, which is perfect if you (like me) work with a Google account. It does have an Intel Celeron 4.1 GHz processor. The battery life of this computer is 8.5 hours, compared to the average 4 hours on other laptops. This says that the start-up speed is 7 seconds, but I swear, it's more like 3 seconds, and the same for shut-down speed. Now, there are two little blue lights, on the front of the computer: the one on the right is if it's charging, and the one on the left is if it's on. One other thing, you don't have to push any buttons for this to turn on. All you have to do is flip it open, and pow! the screen comes on. This is one nice little laptop.One thing I recently figured out is how to download things on to it, it has no major software, but it does the ability to download things, like picture or videos, or you can download the web address. You have to place the mouse on the picture, and tap the mousepad with two fingers, and you'll get the option to download it. You can upload those on to this computer, via jump-drive, so I do that as well. It also comes with this model's standard charging cord, being about 7-10 feet long. Now the space on these may not be so appealing to some: 16GB, or 32GB. One thing you can do, is buy a USB hub, and pug it in and use that as your storage. I have the 16GB, and I'm fine with that, because it gives me some restrictions.This is a great little computer, especially if you need it to do schoolwork. It's light, portable, has great sound and video qualities, great battery life, and a very good processor. I would definately recommend this to any one needing a small computer, or wanting a good one at a low price.

Movies, music and Humble Bundle games run perfectly.I leave a tiny Sandisk Fit 64 GB USB drive in the computer for file storage. Works great.It's amazingly cool and quiet running. The temperature of the notebook barely rises, even when playing games. I haven't yet noticed any fan noise.Just follow the Arch Linux instructions, and you'll have a fast, ultralight linux laptop in no time!Pros: Good performance, lightweight, inexpensive, linux-friendly, cool and quietCons: USB storage needed", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic machine", "Author": "Andrew Willson", "ReviewID": "R2KT9HWUMBVWIC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this on impulse after receiving loads of gift cards for Christmas.

So, I was looking for replacement. But I didn't want to spent too much money for a full-blown notebook, as my main purpose was web surfing and email checking. So, my choice would be either tablet, or chromebook. I tried the 7 inch and 8 inch tablet and I was not happy with the small screen real estate as I didn't want to hurt my vision with small fonts. So, I gave it a try on chromebook.I was surprised that such an inexpensive device could do so much. The whole setup took about 2 to 3 minutes only. After having it for couple of days, it became my favorite machine just because it was so simple, light and super fast start-up with the solid-state drive. Better yet, I never need to worry about virsus or malware. And the battery life was great...8 to 9 hours run on my tests. Some people complained about the keyboard. Frankly, I didn't feel anything wrong with the keyboard.However, the display was a little bit dim for my taste. So, I usually brought up the brightness. This was done easily with the brightness adjustment keys on the keyboard. Not a big deal.I bought the Acer Chromebook from local *C*O*S*T*C*O store because it had a very generous 90-day return policy. Before the end of the 90-day trial period, I bought one more for my daughter for doing homework at after-school center. It's cheap enough so I won't feel too bad if it is damaged.Up to now, I have owned the Acer Chromebook for more than half year and it's used on daily basis. I am very happy with it, especially with its low price and good features.

It was almost 9 years old and obsolete.  I had upgraded it a few times, and it was a real workhorse while it lasted.  The BSOD (blue screen of death) had become a daily occurrence, so I finally let it stay dead.I replaced it with a tablet which I thought would be sufficient since I'm now retired.  But there were limitations - small screen (OK for watching videos & playing games) and no SD card slot.  I hated the virtual keyboard, so I purchased a Bluetooth keyboard, and that helped a lot.  But I really got tired of having to use my sister's laptop to upload photos from my camera plus having constant eyestrain, so I ordered this Chromebook.Setup was quick & easy!  Just log in to your google account and enter your internet password.  I adjusted a few settings for my personal preference, but that was it!  I had already been using Google Drive, so all my docs were already in the cloud.There are numerous reviews here that detail the technical specs, so I won't rehash those.  Just want to say the battery life is excellent, & the keyboard is decent.  And this thing is fast!  I usually have 7 or 8 tabs open, and I haven't noticed any slowing at all.  It boots up in about 7 or 8 seconds, and it wakes up from sleep mode instantly.I use it mostly for YouTube, Facebook, Pinterest, Email, shopping, banking, bill-paying -- all online stuff I've been doing for years.

You can also save files to USB flash drives using the usb ports, but you have to download to the built-in drive first and then cut and paste to the flash drive. There is no DVD player or burner. You can't install on-board software; but we use it mainly for web browsing, You Tube videos, Facebook, etc., so we are very happy with our Acer Chromebook, especially for the low price we paid; and would definitely recommend it to a friend.

It also has a built-in web cam which is surprisingly good quality. You can't use Skype, but you can use Google Hangouts which is similar to Skype.  The only problem we have had is that it often has trouble finding our home wi-fi network and I have to reset my router every now and then and restart the Chromebook to clear up the problem; but I think the problem is being caused by my antique router which I need to replace. As an experiment, I took the Chromebook to several bookstores, coffee shops, McDonald's etc. to test it and it jumped right onto the wi-fi networks every time - it is only at home that I have the connection problems, so I think the Chromebook is fine as long as you have a good strong wireless router.

This is a great Chromebook! It is speedy, has good wifi connectivity, and has all of the features I would expect when buying a pricier model of computer such as a webcam and HDMI port. The battery life on this Chromebook is also insanely good. I have been consistently getting about 7-8hrs of battery life while doing light web browsing and word processing.Now for the slight downsides to this model. First, the 2GB of RAM is not upgradeable later on. The modules are soldered to the motherboard and therefore, cannot be removed. I would have liked to have been able to add more memory later on as the computers aged but alas, that will not be the case with this model. For that reason, I would suggest buying the 4GB model that is available for slightly more money. The 4GB makes the Chromebook a slight be zippier and will help it age more gracefully. The reason I opted for the 2GB version was to see how it performed for the students during their daily tasks and I was also looking to save some money. When I do a complete rollout to the student body, I may end up purchasing the 4GB model for the extra $50 a piece.Lastly, if this is your first Chromebook and you are used to a bigger screen, I don't need to tell you this screen is noticeably smaller than what you are used to. I do most of my work from a 15\" laptop and this model is a strain on my eyes when I have a lot of tabs open. I think users could get used to this but I just wanted to warn potential buyers. Before buying, trying to see what this model looks like in real life to make sure the screen is adequate for your needs.This is a great Chromebook, possibly the best currently on the market at its price point but if you can afford it, get the 4GB version just to stretch the life of the machine a little bit more.", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good computer, but not great.", "Author": "Jschneids86", "ReviewID": "R2UZCPH5TPJSHP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I do like this computer, it's fast and easy to use.

It does pretty much everything you want for everyday use, including fast browsing, playing web-page video or YouTube content, music etc.  The one exception might be writing documents, as the intention is that you use Google apps and Google Drive.  My existing '.odt' OpenOffice (LibreOffice) documents cannot be opened this way.The C720 is lightweight and low power so it doesn't get hot and makes for comfortable laptop browsing.  The 8-hr claim for battery life is a bit optimistic if you happen to launch a few web-page videos, but several hours is realistic on a single charge.I bought it with the intention of using Crouton (chroot) to also run a Linux system in parallel.  So far it works great after installing Ubuntu \"Saucy\" with the Cinnamon desktop.  With this setup you can use ChromeOS for everyday browsing and playing media, and switch instantly to Ubuntu for development work, or to use LIbreOffice for document editing.At $199 this is a new price point for a capable PC.  The dual-core Celeron is way more performant than some quad core Android devices (see my Minix Neo X7 review).My only complaint is that the SD card socket is not one where the card pushes all the way in.  The card sticks out about 1cm, which could lead to damage if it were knocked.

But even for us inbetweeners, this laptop does offer a few attractive features as well.These features are the same for all of us regardless of age; the tendencies that we as individuals have for blaming our human errors on the equipment we are using.

The continuous saving of work product is very embraceable because it doesn't require any additional steps and feels just normal.Now for what this computer cannot do yet: Networking!

It's light, it's sleek, and battery life is fantastic.  My only complaint about the machine is that it does not have a caps lock key.  I don't have to type in all caps very often but when I do, holding shift is a pain in the butt.  I don't see the logic behind removing the caps lock key, but I suppose someone got paid good money to come up with the idea...It is a shame that a nice machine is so limited by the castrated Chrome OS.Now, there are plenty of warnings regarding the fact that a chromebook uses online apps.  I understood that.  However, there is 16 GB free on the hard drive, so I figured that there must be offline apps in the chrome store.  I live in a rural area where internet access is spotty in many places, so if I wanted to edit a text or image file, I would be able to do so.  I also thought I would be able to store and listen to some music.  Not a lot, obviously, but some to keep me occupied if I was in an area where there was no wifi.  I was also hoping for some light, offline games.So I head over to the chrome store... and there isn't much.  The selection, even for online apps, is small.  When you install an online app, chrome simply puts a site-specific launcher in the menu.  The game section if the store is particularly heart-wrenching, because many of the games don't even work on light hardware such as this.  I knew something was suspicious when I saw apps that had complex, 3D graphics.  It's as if Chrome just puts links in the store without bothering to check if they even work.  Many games do not even exist anymore.  If you want games, you're stuck with cartoonish multiplayer games, such as you would find on Facebook.This would not be a huge problem in and of itself... except, Android is so much more functional.  I have a generic Android device that I spent $30 for on black Friday.  It has many offline apps, a USB keyboard that makes it feel like a netbook, and battery life is even longer.  It is also more customizable as far as appearance goes.  With Chrome OS, all you can really do is change the background.So, while this chromebook was cheap, I could have spent even less and gotten a much more functional device.  It's pretty sad.  I can't even use Tor on my chromebook, and with the recent scandals surrounding internet anonymity, I view this as a flaw.Now, all this being said, there are so pro's to the way ChromeOS functions.  Since everything is in the cloud, if the OS is damaged in any way, the Chrome recovery tool will fix everything up in a no time, and all your data will be safe in the cloud.My biggest feeling with ChromeOS... disappointment.  Google could have created a more traditional OS and swept Microsoft aside.  Linux is incredible and the open source community is vast, and many applications that compete with Microsoft apps already exist.Instead, all I got was a netbook that runs the Chrome browser.  That is literally all ChromeOS is, a glorified browser.It is possible to install Linux on a chromebook, but there are problems with the touchpad.  Furthermore, installing another OS entails entering developer mode, where a scary boot screen stating that the OS is damaged appears with every boot.  The screen advises you to press a certain key to repair the OS... which will wipe your entire Linux install.  With a single keystroke.  Not a big deal if you know what you are doing, but if some unsuspecting friend booted your machine and read the message, you can kiss your data goodbye.If you do most of your stuff online, ChromeOS is fine, if you like paying more for less.

I brought a bargain during the holiday rush, only to find out that I can have 6 more GB of SSD space if I wait for a bit for the same price.  But then I probably get more for everybody.I actually prefer the Chrome OS.  It's zero maintenance.  No more backup for other people.  It should be fairly easy to sync firefox bookmarks and files across all machines.  But you need to setup.  If you are using the Google services, you are already setup before buying the C720.  If you lost the whole thing, the only thing other people can see is your google user name.  Everything is securely encrypted.  You don't even need to leave your username, but you just have to type it everytime you login.  I had been moving my kids to do homework on Drive so they don't need to worry saving, and can do it on whatever computer they can grasp.  I like Drive for the perfect version control.Chrome OS has very limited apps.  It doesn't support wmv, though probably support most of codecs used in avi.  But the FLEX app works because it is pure html.  You can stream any movies from another machine as server.  If the codec is not supported in Chromeos, it will transcode as it streams.  But you need a decent machine to be fast enough.  Chromeos supports L2TP and a more secure startup mode of openvpn, that most canned vpn servers doesn't support that yet.You can install and switch to Crouton (Ubuntu Linux) and back with a hot key.  But ... the same Chromeos kernel is used that is incompatible with the Ubuntu and other Linux kernels.  So Crouton can't be the answer to everything unless it can hot swap the kernel too.  Also, to start Crouton you have to get a terminal in Chrome, type the startup command, and leave the tab on.  I tried to save a few dollars by staying with my old vpn provider while having a cup of coffee but the Chromeos openvpn won't work in Crouton.ChrUbuntu in Intel machines is more like a full blown Ubuntu.  It takes well over an hour to install.  Crouton takes somewhat less.  It occupy less than 5GB.  With 2GB left for Chromeos, I have 3GB user space left for Ubuntu.  Openvpn works.  Encryption works.  For codecs you need to install Ubuntu restricted stuff via software centre.  Full HD WMV works.  Trackpad works as in Chromeos plus you can use finger only to drag without the left mouse button - the Ubuntu/Unity way.In a way, dual boot ChrUbuntu is more convenient.  When you power on the chrome book, you will see the warning screen in developer mode, ctrl-D will lead you into the Default Chromeos, and ctrl-L will lead you into the Legacy OS Ubuntu.  Even if you need to switch OS, both boot up very fast in the C720.There are some caveats if you comes from Windows or Linux.  There are no mouse buttons on the C720 trackpad.  But the whole trackpad is actually a left mouse button.  Instead of the right mouse button, you can use double finger tap, which is superior and you can't miss.  There's no edge scrolling but I prefer two finger scrolling.  There are no more F function keys.  It is not just with different names.  Full screen is usually F11 but on Chromeos it is F4 if you count the position.  There is one USB 3 and one USB 2 socket because (?) USB 2 device won't work on the USB 3.  And you have to have another computer plus printer connected to the internet so you can print from your Chromebook using cloud print, unless your printer is cloud print ready (not even a wifi printer).The speed of C720 is impressive.  It takes a lot less time to boot Ubuntu, but I don't know how much \"smaller\" the distribution is.  For movies in a USB 3 drive, you can use the > and < key to fast forward and back at will.  I don't know how to say this but it's like fast forwarding a VCR, but smoothly and much faster if you don't let go of the key.  You can scroll through the movie in a minute but you can pinpoint to the exact sec with ease.  Just two keys.  It's the same in Chromeos by default and in Ubuntu too.  But by default the Ubuntu player skips 1 minute and back something like 30 sec.  It should be capable of 10 sec forward and 5 sec back, while fast forwarding (and backward) the whole movie in a minute.", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good for now... still learning Google OS", "Author": "becky keith", "ReviewID": "R2AHOH6O5UTRT1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "still learning about Google OS operating system.

I did not expect the Chromebook to replace my full blown Windows or Linux PC's.  I did, however, expect to be able to do a few key activities.1.  I use gmail for business and personal email as do many people I know.  On a Windows machine I can look at both account easily by using 2 different browsers and being looged in to each gamil account in a different browser.  Chrome OS IS the browser so you log into the machine using your gmail account.  To Look at another gmail account your have to log out and log into the machine as a different user.  This got old after the first hour of use.2.  Let kids play games and browse with some limitations.  As far as gaming online goes this chrome OS appears to be useless.  When my kid is using this machine I am getting called to assist every 2 minutes because some plugin is required and is either not supported by chrome or has crashed.  Playing exact same online games on a Windows PC works fine 90% of the time.  On Chrome OS is works 10% of the time.3.  Remote desktop.  It does not work.  Period.  I am technically adept and must use VPN clients to access remote machines for my job every day.  Chrome simply does not support VPN.  I tried very hard to get this to work and will not devote my time to elaborate on details here.  Suffice to say Chrome's remote desktop is not an option for me and VPN does not work.I wanted this Chromebook concept to work for me and I tried hard to make it work.  Chromebook as a concept does not provide myself or my family with what we need.

The wireless MAC number for this device is not listed on the box or the device itself and the setup screen does not allow any exit to determine what the MAC number is (the Continue button is inactive even if 'No network' is selected).  So - the MAC number of the device cannot be determined so it cannot be put in the wireless access point MAC filter table to allow it to connect.  Chat with Acer tech support was useless - they offered suggestions that will not work to determine the MAC address until at least one connection has been made or using keystroke combinations including Function keys that do not exist on the device.In the end we went to our local library where there is wireless access but no MAC filtering.  Connection was instantaneous and at that point the network icon (lower right of screen) became visible and usable to determine the MAC address.

As mentioned above, this is an absolutely horrible thing to do to a device designed to be \"always connected.\"", "Date": "February 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "I really wanted to love this", "Author": "kamikrolock", "ReviewID": "RM51O499LCXZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "A year ago I bought this machine to primarily serf the web and watch Netflix. My MacBook, bought in 07, just could not handle streaming videos. For the price I thought this was great and I loved the concept. It was small and fast and perfect for those times when I just wanted to watch a movie or do a little shopping. However 6 months after purchasing the unit, the cord went bad. I had to go round and round with Acer to send me a replacement cord. I even had to buy an off brand replacement until I could get them to ship one out. Then I started having issues with the unit heating up too much and shutting down on me even when I was not running any apps. The last straw was when, less than a week after the year long warranty  ran out, the jack for the power cord started malfunctioning. I could only get it to charge in a few positions. I looked into getting it fixed and it will cost more to have it fixed than what it cost me to purchase the Item, a total loss.I now write this review from the MacBook Pro that I finally just bit the bullet and bought. I'm going to upgrade my SEVEN year old Mackbook to use in conjunction with the Pro.I was not expecting the Chromebook to last as long as my Mac, but seriously, a year? Shame on you Acer. Just bite the bullet and buy the PC or Mac you really want.Edit:I have the previous version of this but my brothers (which is pretty much identical except for the caseand battery life) is having the same issues as well.
