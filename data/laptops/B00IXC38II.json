There isn't a whole bunch of useless features that would have ordinarily made this really expensive. It has the power that I want to manage my Graphics, and Games. It is also slim, which is great. It also has back light keys that you can turn on or off, but it isn't that bright, yet it is bright enough to give you sight of the keys in dim lighting, and even better sight in darkness.", "Date": "April 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "No Complaints Here", "Author": "Jennifer", "ReviewID": "R2HHTRHF7339HX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The number 1 reason I chose this machine is it is one of the few still available with Windows 7. Will agree and disagree with others here...I don't think the keyboard is flimsy or that the back light leaks at all.  Actually,  I find the light helpful in darker/dimmer settings.  Agree to the fast performance, easy setup too.  If you use Google setup is a breeze because you sign into your account and Google does the rest; can't beat that!  No bloatware and bogus programs imbedded that I don't need or want.  My primary use is personal and for video performance at church each week.  Doing exactly what I expect.  Here is hoping that it lasts longer than my former Pavillion DV7 that the hard drive blew up in 27 months...and the HP warranty expired in 24 months.  Of course I just missed the warranty window.  So far so good!  Should something change I will update.", "Date": "May 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "17\" Laptop", "Author": "Chris Lamb", "ReviewID": "R3ARM767CI1F2F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This thing works great very fast.
