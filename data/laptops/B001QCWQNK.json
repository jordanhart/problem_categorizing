With new ones much too pricey and repairing it not worth the cost, I decided to find a used one, first looking in local computer stores and then online. I was nervous about not being able to see the product before purchasing, but the reviews for Beta Computers Distribution INC http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?ie=UTF8&marketplaceID;=ATVPDKIKX0DER&me;=ADZ1J2UVKWD2C seemed positive enough.The laptop arrived in good time and well packed. It was clean and looked almost brand new. We have had no problems with it whatsoever. This is an older model (late 2006) and so only came with 1GB of RAM holding a maximum of 2GB so I upgraded immediately for around $50. The speed is sufficient for general use (email, browsing, word processing), but a later model would be better for more powerful computing.Good job Beta Computers Distribution INC!", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very nice product for the cost", "Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "RJL0KG6ZWBAKM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recommend this company, for good CS and for a well delerved product for it to be used.

The purchase was for my daughter who had a similar make and model during her 2010-11 middle school years. She loves it. System is stable and functioning fine. No arguments with quality. Even cosmetically, I was impressed to find little to no wear. Very obvious this laptop had been cared for. Only draw back for me was in delivery from Beta Mac. No documentation in the form of delivery receipts, purchase receipts, etc. Just a box with bubble wrap and the laptop. If I hadn't retained my purchase information upon buying online, I would have no way to reconnect with the company. Additionally, as the OS and iLife package is preinstalled, with no associating softward CDs, (just the laptop and battery cable) it looks like I'll be replacing/upgrading these myself in the event we move forward or the system needs reformatted.

My wife also had a iBook G4.I use a PC all day at work, and after selling my iMac briefly used a work PC at home as my primary computer for about three months.  That was enough for me, I needed another Mac for home - I just enjoy the experience much more.I initially had shopped for PC laptops with larger screens, and was a bit hesitant to get the 13\" screen, but it's worked out well for me - I use a DVI to HDMI cable to work at home on a 22\" widescreen monitor, and still have a laptop that is small enough to lug around when needed.I'm not thrilled with the initial specs on the MacBook, but a couple of them were easy to rectify - on the advice of another reviewer here, I immediately upgraded to 4GB of RAM on my own, and replaced the drive with a 360 GB 7200 RPM Seagate drive.  The system screams now, and I have plenty of room for everything I need.I also installed 64-bit Vista using Bootcamp for my occasional work-at-home projects, I can't speak highly enough of this functionality.Included software is great - out of the whole iLife suite (iPhoto, iDVD, iMovie, GarageBand, iWeb), I've used all of the software short of iWeb, and they've all been very handy and intuitive.I will be purchasing more Macs in my future.", "Date": "July 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Least expensive MacBook, but go Pro", "Author": "Cuyler", "ReviewID": "R2MFR8919KZ28F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I believe this is a discontinued model and most people would probably order the latest version of this MacBook (unless this one is available for a lower price).  But actually, I believe the 2009 13-inch MacBook Pro is worth the higher price for the following reasons:- it's a little faster- it's a little lighter- the aluminum finish is more durable- the all metal body should dissipate heat better- the large glass trackpad is more durable- multi-touch gestures make it easier to navigate- keyboard lights up at night- expands up to 8GB of memory (useful for the future)- longer battery life- the matte aluminum finish with black keys is beautifulFor me, these features justify the extra cost, which is why I purchased the Pro -- others might not feel they are important.  I am writing this review mostly so people thinking about the white MacBook at least consider the Pro version before making a final purchase.Note -- I got the least expensive of the 13-inch MacBook Pro which has slightly lower processor speed, smaller disk and just 2GB of RAM.  The processor speed on the more expensive model is nice, but it's not significantly faster and the disk and memory can be upgraded later when prices drop (I eventually will get a solid-state drive and 8GB).", "Date": "July 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Works great but!!!!!!", "Author": "Bsmall", "ReviewID": "R2JOZ6Z76948HL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Apple MacBook works great however after getting it and turning it on for the first time the mouse didnt work properly.
