The screen is very clear, and I discovered that just angling it will increase or decrease the contrast of the picture. The keyboard is much easier to use than the old-fashioned kind, and I'm getting spoiled. I chose this Lenovo because I need the DVD drive, which seems to have gone the way of the dinosaur in laptops. I also wanted the headphone/mic jack. With those two essentials, the choice was limited.The Windows 8.1 has been a fun learn. I don't know all the ins and outs yet, but I really do like what I know of it so far.I see that others began having problems quite soon after purchase, but I have hopes. I am holding down the stars to 4 instead of 5, just because it is early in the game, but nothing has fallen off, the mouse pad still works, and the OS is as slick as anything Microsoft has come out with yet.One big advantage of laptops is that it has sure neatened up my desk!

I was really excited about what we were getting for the price and figured it was due to the fact that it's a lesser known brand. I read a ton of reviews and got an overall good feeling about Lenovo as a brand. We drove across town in crappy snow weather to get this laptop since the convenient store didn't have any in stock and we were sold on this computer.  The first laptop we brought home had a defective disc drive. I would hit the button to open it and it would jam- I had to force it to open. So I took it back and waited a week for another to be shipped from an out of town store.  The performance  seemed Ok as far as the basics that I used this for but this is limited usage so I can't say much there. Anything would seem great compared to the 7 year old Dell I was replacing. Windows 8 is confusing to me. I am a quick learner with technology but it is lacking instruction and everything seems to be hidden now. The touch screen seems pretty receptive but the mouse not so much. After a little use I've discovered that this laptop is obviously very cheaply made. I was willing to overlook the wobbly screen (annoying when using touch screen) and the smudge-attracting material this is made with but then I noticed tonight that the THIN little piece of plastic covering the keys (part of the keyboard) is not attached correctly. One edge of this piece is sticking up when it should be secured flat. I am taking this computer back to the store tomorrow. This has made a very bad impression on Lenovo for me & I will probably just pay a little more for a more reputable brand name. I want something that feels sturdy that I can be assured will last me awhile. I'd rather put my $550 towards something else.************So we decided to keep this computer. The experience has been pretty negative all the way around but I think I was a little harsh with my first review. It turns out that the edge of the keyboard piece that was sticking up was an easy fix- popped right into place with no issues since. After looking at some other laptops I discovered that this particular piece is flimsy and looks cheap on them ALL. For the money, this laptop was the best choice all the way around- speed, storage space, and reputation. I am loving the very responsive touch screen and even with my basic wifi-router the computer is impressively fast. I love the keyboard-soft, smooth keys and easy to use. So far I am adjusting to Windows 8 and haven't tried a lot of the features that this computer offers. I will do another update after I try some more stuff!", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Well..... I've been spoiled, but this is bull.", "Author": "Cody", "ReviewID": "R7ZYFDVNJZCCN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Hello, well this laptop is a very nice laptop in my opinion for actual physical hardware don't get me wrong on that, however the keyboard could feel a little more sturdy to me. But let's start off by saying that windows 8.1 (or 8 doesn't matter) sucks. Yes its touchscreen and what not but that does not make windows 8 not suck. Its terrible, no start button, and so many software glitches. The one that is causing me problems I am almost sure is a Windows 8 problem because ever since the day I upgraded to windows 8.1 (about 2 weeks after I bought it) I have been having a screen problem.  I have researched it online on many websites across many brands and almost every brand will have multiple people complaining about their screen not coming back on after it goes to sleep. Well I am one of the lucky ones to get this problem. So If you enjoy completely shutting your computer off so you wont lose any data every time you will be away from the laptop for 5 minutes, buy this. But if you are like most people and don't like doing this. Don't buy this. It happens about 4/5 times for me and so unless I am gonna be sitting typing for a long time and not walking off, it is almost unusable cause I have to hard restart it every time almost. And anything that is running I lose. I just don't understand how companies like Microsoft and Lenovo (whoever's fault it is for this problem) can't have simple stuff like waking from sleep mode solved by now... for goodness sake. I've only had this for a month and barely a half and it has glitched since about the 2 week mark, notice since I upgraded to Windows 8.1. And I've had my custom built gaming PC for over half a year with never one lag or problem on Win 7 Pro. Step it up Microsoft, please.GREAT laptop if you don't get the black screen problem 4/5 times you use it. But for me this is just not acceptable.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00F0RC024"}}
