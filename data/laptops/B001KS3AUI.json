A reliable machine that has never let me down. I wasn't sure when I first purchased the netbook if 1 GB of ram and 120 GB of memory would be ok or if I was wasting my money and I can honestly say that I have been nothing but impressed with my netbook. The SD card slot allows you to expand your storage which is handy as well as the 3 USB 2.0 ports which allows you to use a wireless mouse and other accessories which use USB ports. I have used my netbook for college which consists of using microsoft office and accessing the web. The wireless works great and always is able to find and connect on to wifi without a hitch. The 3 cell battery is nice because it cuts down on the weight which is nice for those who are carrying their netbook around with them throughout the day. I can honestly say that my netbook has been a great tool for me and I would highly recommend this machine to anyone looking for an affordable, reliable and efficient machine.", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great netbook!", "Author": "Eddy Ream", "ReviewID": "R9J4PU3TB92TJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Big fan of this netbook!  Only issue that I have is that the battery pack is dead.  I can only use the netbook when plugged into the wall.  I'll have to buy a new battery pack.", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "i wonder ?!", "Author": "Eduardo", "ReviewID": "RB9TJCV3XV061", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Jaa i don't know what happened to this beauty , its gone since i recived ; you know gifts jaa , news are that still around after amore then a year++++ ,,", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001KS3AUI"}}
