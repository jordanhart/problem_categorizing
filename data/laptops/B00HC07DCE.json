{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good laptop, bad OS", "Author": "Thomas Gantner", "ReviewID": "R19MMO013GGE1L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good laptop for the money. One option I wanted was a DVD drive which this has. Most touch screens in this price range do not. Touch screen works great so far. Prepare to clean the prints off regularly. Web cam is good enough.  No issues with freezing or slowness.  Battery lasts a good 4 hours or more. Havent really checked accurately. The one thing I don't like about this computer is the keyboard. It has a number pad on the right side which I thought I would like but that addition means all the keys are shifted to the left and not centered on the computer.  The only other thing I don't like is the mouse pad. If you swipe too close to the edge of the mouse pad it switches between your open programs which inadvertently happens a lot. I am not a fan of Windows 8. It is not very user friendly. I will be looking forward to the next OS.", "Date": "April 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "wow!!! fast", "Author": "George Pashales", "ReviewID": "RX0AA4PPBDGIP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "excellent for the moneyfast and senior friendlywould recommend to anyone who uses computer for all the simple daily things", "Date": "May 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic touch screen laptop", "Author": "Dianne L.

I've been in trouble a few times with back up on windows 8.1, or the program Office,(bought on line and downloaded) and or  the printer failed, so  HP configured, scanned out the problem and fixed it ... That's really nice to have in with your computer, to use  when you need it.  This laptop takes 6 DVD+R to back up Microsoft  Windows,  I must say, it needs to be done.  It keeps upgrading on its own, the Windows program every week with new unnoticeable stuff just to make it better.  Not all computers can Burn DVDs or CDs and this one does. That's great if your into Music, or Videos ,Photographs . (Witch I am)  Good feature for me.The down side of this laptop is the surface below the keyboard is very shinny and leaves finger prints.  I wished they would of made it with surface like the key pad has, that would of been A lot  better.Even though the screen is touch I recommend using a mouse with it  (A lot faster and has more control)Computer has plenty of space for storage, I would  also recommend a External Hard Drive to back up every thing you have on file.It's a great machine ....  and would recommend this to a friend any time", "Date": "April 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "William Ganser", "ReviewID": "R1J4N0TWZGTBGF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Love the Windows 8.1.  Lot of people have said they don't like it.  I believe this is because they don't take the time to read and view the provided videos that explain how thing work and where they are.  Only gave it 4 stars due to the problem I am having with trying to turn on \"Windows Defender\".", "Date": "June 8, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": "Intel Core i5-4200U DC 1.6 GHz\n6 GB DDR3L SDRAM\n750 GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive\n15.6-Inch Screen, Intel HD graphics 4400\n6.25-hour battery life", "Name": "HP Pavilion 15-N280US 15.6-Inch Touchsmart Laptop (Silver And Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416wjakAPOL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00HC07DCE"}}
