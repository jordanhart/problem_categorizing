Looking around, I see 3 usb inputs. The Touchpad is accented with with a texture to make it easier to drag your fingers, the touch-pad also has firm mouse buttons which help you from clicking things by accident. The keys are thin but firm,tight, and well made. For the price this was a steal, most sites have this product set between $559.99 - $659.99. I was looking for power on a budget, and I got that with the Quad Core A6, along with the 6GB of Ram. Also I noticed this Laptop has a AMD Radeon HD 8400 graphics with up to 3053MB total graphics memory that is not listed in this products description on here. The 8400 is the best in the 8000 Series so that was also a steal. Visit AMD's graphics website if you want to know what a Series is. Also, If I left anything out just comment and I'm sure I can get back to you.Full time college Student", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop!!", "Author": "Kyndra's mommie", "ReviewID": "R1J2A7FDH4A9E5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop so i could do my college online classes!

I type all day for my work and really like this keyboard.AppearanceI was skeptical at first about the AMD Quad Core, knowing that there were better processors. But I've had no trouble at all with the AMD. I use my laptop for tons of MS Word processing, photos, internet research,  and watching movies. No games. For those uses the AMD is fine.CONS:1. The screen seems to have more glare than my previous laptop, to the point of significant eye strain.2. I've had Windows 8.1 professionally installed on two laptops recently. There were no problems with the first one (on a Toshiba Satellite). Things didn't go as well with this HP Pavilion. I spent several days working out bugs after the installation. I've had an internet connectivity problem from the beginning and have not been able to solve it after a lot of research. I don't know  whether this is actually  a hardware problem. I'm only saying that there were far more problems with the HP installation and some unsolved bugs.", "Date": "March 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Hate the OS", "Author": "Labrat", "ReviewID": "REHJNQIQ77328", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Computer was received in a timely manner with no problems. The problem seems to be Windows 8. Very cumbersome and non user friendly. Like wise it drops my internet connection on a regular basis. I like my 8 year old Dell with Vista better than this.

I had to get rid of the spyware that comes with it that seemed to be bogging it down terribly and I had to get a program called Start8 that makes everything look like Windows 7 because I did not like Windows 8, but now that I have my programs and files and have completely moved from the old, failing computer to the new one, I am super super happy with everything about it. I bought my last HP 4 years ago for 50% more than this one and it was a refurb. I love that the prices are coming down so much.", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "good computer", "Author": "steventheo69", "ReviewID": "R1MIRJHUDQIHYO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good computer but only usb port and comes unplugged easily.
