The new features on windows 8 are pretty good, maybe a little disorganized but on the other hand, it's really fast and works perfectly with Adobe software which I use a lot.So if you don't mind the size (or maybe if you do) this is an amazing computer for those who want a great performance and a well sized screen.", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Purchase and No faults", "Author": "Hamza Parvez", "ReviewID": "R35PEFN69PI0XL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Its a great product and reached in time and is perfect with no faults. everything thing is working perfect. Bit big but worth for gaming and other work. Battery life is good unless u play games on it. Audio quality is amazing which is by beats. Specs are worth the price. However the negative about this laptop is the trackpad, its hard but u can get away with it buy using the gestures instead or a mouse . Will totally recommend to people who want gaming and work on the same laptop but with a smaller size unless used as desktop pc.", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice computer ... if only it worked.", "Author": "Karen", "ReviewID": "RWODN1X7SVULF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased the Envy 17T because I wanted a touch screen.  The problem has been the quality of the computer and the support from HP. The first 2 computers I received, the touch screen didn't work.  The 3rd computer had a touch screen that worked but a lot of other issues including a backspace key that caused the computer to constantly try to back up all the time, the power adapter cable was really lose and constantly falling out, the wireless internet failed to work every time the computer was rebooted or the lid was closed and it would take anywhere from 10-20 minutes just to repair the computer to get it to connect to the internet.  Computer was again returned for repairs and it worked for almost two months before the hard drive and motherboard failed.  Now I'm having to send it back in for repairs AGAIN.  I'm not a happy customer ... far from it.  Based on the quality of the product and workmanship on the computers I've been receiving from HP, I don't think that I would ever purchase another HP computer again.", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing and powerful computer.

About a week ago the wifi stoppedworking. i called tech support tonight. two hours later, the wifi is working, but noe audio. they want to take it back to factory setting and delete everyrthing to get it working. I had to do that with computers after a few years but never after a few months.
