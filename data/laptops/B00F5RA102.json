I was honestly expecting a bit of frustration when I started using the computer, based on this fact.  Trust me, a few minor tweaks (including upgrading to Windows 8.1) and I've had nothing but smooth sailing.  The computer is extremely fast, extremely useful.  It is very light (weight), and the battery lasts enough for you to complete any task you might need (4+ hours).  Great picture quality.  In few words...great performance all around.  So far, found no reason to complain.", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$899.00", "Features": "Intel Core i5 3230M 2.6 GHz\n8 GB DDR3\n750 GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive\n15.6-Inch Screen, Intel HD Graphics 4000\nWindows 8, 4.8-hour battery life", "Name": "Samsung ATIV Book 2 NP270E5G-K04US 15.6-Inch Laptop (Mineral Ash Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41AWpsrqvQL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00F5RA102"}}
