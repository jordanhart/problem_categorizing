{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A good little Macbook", "Author": "Joshua B. Brackin", "ReviewID": "R2J7YTT9DMI0Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Macbook was released in late 2006/early 2007. Although that may seem like a long time ago in computer-time, this Macbook still stays current. It comes loaded with features that many modern-day PC Laptops lack. It's fully compatible with all of Apple's latest programs and is still quick and nimble even today. My model is loaded with the Calistoga chipset and can support up to 3.2 GB of RAM (even though Apple will tell you that it will only take up to 2 GB). This RAM upgrade makes a huge difference with the overall speed of the system. I also upgraded mine to a 500 GB 7200 RPM Hard Drive which drastically increased the system speed.It's not a gaming computer. This model comes with 64 MB of shared Video Memory. It's more than enough to stream 720p videos, but not enough to enjoy any serious gaming. This is more of a media device anyway. The only cons that I can think of are that it does not include an SD Card Port and that it only has 2 USB ports. Both of these issues are minor and are the same for all Macbooks. I can confirm that it is fully compatible with the upcoming release of OS X Lion and runs it well. I use it in conjunction with my iPad 2 and iPhone 4 and couldn't be happier. If you're someone that is looking for a good laptop that can do business and entertainment related tasks, then this is the one that you want. It's not a gaming computer or the best choice for heavy graphic work. However it will do everything else with ease and is an awesome addition to my Mac collection.*NOTE: To run OS X Lion, you must upgrade this to at least 2 GB of RAM. The included 1 GB is not enough to run the new system.EDIT: After installing the latest update for OS X Lion, the system now recognizes all 4 GB of RAM! It would not recognize more than 3.2 GB in Snow Leopard.", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Value for the Money - Good but Older Used MacBook Product", "Author": "Joseph", "ReviewID": "R33EGKSL6M11FW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will try to provide potential future consumers with an accurate and thorough review of this computer.The Apple MacBook notebook offered for sale on this Amazon catalog page presents a good value for the money.  Of course, this is an older model Apple product, having been released and sold approximately at retail stores in 2007 and 2008.As such, it is reasonable that one can expect it to have some cosmetic signs of previous use (for instance, some peeling/cracking to the edges of the palmrest is a famous and common issue on the original white MacBook models), and to be of different appearance from what Apple is currently selling through its Apple Store outlets.  Apple no longer manufactures any portable notebook in a white-colored plastic body (having since moved on to the 'aluminum' colored \"unibody\" design).All this being said, the average consumer should still find this to be a nice looking computer, and it is capable of running the large majority of the software that is out there today for the Apple Macintosh platform (as of the time of my writing this review, late 2012/early 2013)-- probably greater than 99% of what is available today.This machine runs Snow Leopard, which offers a high level of compatibility both with Mac software products from earlier in the decade (i.e., the PowerPC era circa 2002-2006/7), all the way up to recent software releases like productivity suites such as Microsoft Office 2011, iWork '09, iLife '11, as well as serving as an above-average to good platform for Photoshop CS4 and CS5 and CS5.5, Logic Pro / Logic Studio and some light video work and editing with Final Cut Pro and Final Cut Studio 3. (None of these additional software products is included with the device, aside from the operating system).For the software all users can appreciate, the latest versions of iTunes, Safari, FireFox, Chrome, and Skype all run on this model.It can even play some not-too-3D-graphics-intensive games like the popular Minesweeper and WoW respectably enough, limited only by the use of an Intel-based integrated graphics chipset.Amazon 'on-demand' streaming video (currently Adobe Flash based), YouTube (both Adobe Flash and HTML5 based), Google Video (Adobe Flash or HTML5), Netflix (through the downloadable Microsoft Silverlight plug-in) and Hulu (Adobe Flash) streaming work quite well on this machine, although you may wish to add more RAM or limit the number of applications you are multitasking with if you are intending to have HD level video output with these streaming services (720p grade quality seems to be the upper limit on this machine for these services).Facebook applications depending on Adobe Flash also run very well on this model in my personal experience.  You can watch standard video DVDs, and burn audio discs and data CDs.  It has a built in 'iSight' webcam (approximately 1.3MP resolution) and microphone for video chatting or Skyping.This MacBook can be expanded up to 4GB of RAM (it uses DDR2 SDRAM SODIMM sticks; use 256MB/512MB/1GB/2GB PC2-5300 or PC2-5400 modules for best compatibility); it comes default from the manufacturer with 1GB of RAM, so there is still some potential room to grow.  It can handle any 2.5\" SATA hard drive from the usual 60GB/80GB/120GB/160GB suspects all the way up to the current 1.0+ terabyte models (if you should feel the need to upgrade).  There is no SD or media card slot on this model. The LCD is a glossy finish widescreen display supporting up to 1280x800 resolution.  Mini-DVI video output, digital headphones out, digital microphone/line-in, 1 IEEE1384 Firewire port, 2 USB 2.0-compliant ports, built-in gigabit wired ethernet and high-speed wireless 'Airport Extreme' networking round out the set of features on this laptop.This machine does not run Mountain Lion, but Snow Leopard, as said before, can run the majority of everything important out there software-wise at the moment, and is among the most consistent and reliable releases of Mac OS X that Apple has thus far released.If you can live knowing you are not running the latest model (which may be hard for some users, given the designer brand nature of the Apple name), instead appreciating the still high level of software compatibility this model allows and recognizing the general elegance and snappiness of the Apple software interface [even on an older model], and if you can live with small cosmetic shortcomings given the age of the device, this is a *more than fair* value that should get most users through at least two years of good use.An additional plus comes from the Intel architecture of the CPU on this MacBook; you can use BootCamp, or, if you prefer, VMWare / Parallels, to run Microsoft Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8 as well as any PC portable with similar hardware features.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Mac laptop", "Author": "DNugent", "ReviewID": "RWQW9LNKYZV4M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great laptop bought one from Mac a few years back still works great and our son wanted a MacBook but he's only thirteen so we didn't want to get a brand new one just in case he ruined it so we searched online for like two months and found this one.

The only thing that I noticed that I will have to replace soon is the battery because it holds only about 2 1/2 hour of charge but I found the battery online for about $40, so not bad. I waited a couple of weeks before reviewing this product because I really wanted to test it out. My uses for it include: school, programming, and streaming/watching videos.

Ramani", "ReviewID": "R1DHPWYH7PJVE6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The MacBook, a late 2006 edition, with OS X 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard) and iWorks looks immaculate when opened, though showing significant wear on both the top and bottom outside covers. Battery life is as advertised by Apple for this model. The laptop runs hot (hot to the palms).  My main objection is the \"scuff marks\" on the screen, which is a problem with LCD screens, it appears. People clean screens with any thing and any means, it appears, not knowing the very, very delicate nature of LCD screens (displays). If I was the Product Manager of Apple laptops, I will have a printed notice in red ink with every Mac warning about cleaning screens matter-of-factly - - people use windex, tap-water soaked cloth or paper-towel, etc., etc., and cause stains and scuff marks, like my laptop has (on arrival). Fortunately, I cannot see these stains/scuff marks when the screen is lit-up/laptop being used (occasionally, I see the outlines but barely). When the screen is dark, the stains/scuff marks look terrible. Why did Beta Macs (Company that sold me the laptop) not bother to remove these stains? Obviously, they cannot! For $400 I paid for this ancient (2006) laptop, if there are going to be blemishes, like a bad screen, the seller should lower the price by $100 and not call the laptop condition: \"very good\"!

This product deserves 0 STARs!", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "An affordable, yet powerful little machine", "Author": "Andrew Greimann", "ReviewID": "R2YWA9YBKVRT8I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before in history, I remember that there were the very expensive Intel Mac notebooks, and then there were the G3s and G4s that someone could purchase, but they didn't have all the power that the newer Intel models had. Now, that has all changed, because the polycorbonate MacBooks (these) are the most popular Macs in this series, and also the most affordable. These are able to run Snow Leopard (OS X v10.6) which is still compatible with iTunes 11, Safari, Chrome, and most popular applications on the market today, even though it's from 2009. More recent 64-bit dual-core 2008 models can run Lion (and if you can figure out how to get it installed if the guides for doing so are true, Mountain Lion) which makes these earn their spot in history and makes them afforably runnable at only 30% or 40% of the price of the brand-new Macs that are coming out now.The computer is really, really simple. All the ports are on one side--including the MagSafe port these computers introduced. Simply pop the magnetic connector on or off to charge or to go (which is standard now on all the Macs). I believe these support USB 2.0, as they copy really quickly to external drives I've connected, and AirPort handles like new. The latch is totally magnetic, so it opens easily. These include sudden motion sensing, which means a drop shouldn't, in theory, kill the HDD, but I wouldn't test this with anything important on it. :) The trackpad is really smooth to the touch, and supports multi-touch, including two-finger scrolling. The keyboard definitely has the Apple quality I have come to love from previous notebooks, and is super simple to use (and clean!) Simply use a common cleaning wipe and carefully massage the keys to get the smudges off them. I really think the island style design (one of the best features used by Apple to this day) is how a notebook keyboard should be. The only problem is that the edges chip eventually, but this doesn't affect the way these run. And finally, as a complaint, the only problem with these is upgrading the memory--you have to manually pry the L-shaped shield away after removing several small screws in the battery bay on some of these, and from there, use the levers and push the new RAM into place. I honestly wish this design would have never been used, but in some of these, it's there. But, for classic fun or to run Windows without Boot Camp, use VirtualBox, Mini vMac, SheepShaver, and other fun utilities if you have time. :)In my opinion, this is my most loved Apple machine ever, outside of the Classic II and the 12\" iBook G3. I hope that these work for years to come as it will always be a favorite.", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "World's best customer service!", "Author": "Lisa B", "ReviewID": "R1LJKCDO9IJFZI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This company goes above and beyond to ensure their products arrive as promised in the condition promised, and usually much faster than you expect.

You could say I am kind of a computer geek (mainly pc) and I wanted to get my feet wet in the apple pool (more like ocean!).  I saw this MacBook as a good platform to start with.  I had figured I would upgrade the ram and hard drive with better ones that I had from other laptops but when I went to upgrade the ram, there was a sticker that said \"WARRANTY VOID IF REMOVED\".  I thought this was odd because the ram is easily accessible if the battery is removed.  I wound up removing it anyway and put 4gb of GSkill laptop memory in it.  It says it reads all 4gb but from what I read this OS only uses up to 3.2gb of it.  For a dual core I was surprised how well this handled photoshop.  I took this to the local Apple store when I first got it to have it checked out but the tech there said they could not service it because it was not all original.  It turns out that when it was refurbished by Wegner Media, they replaced the battery, frame around screen, keyboard frame, & mousepad with cheaper versions.  Also the previous owner did not take proper care of the laptop as there are tons of scratches on it (not the re-seller's fault) and their name was etched into it on the bottom.  I have to say, the beauty is on the inside of this one.  The mac UI is starting to grow on me.  I mainly bought this laptop so that I could have a dedicated mobile machine for web design.  It certainly beats carrying my 17\" Asus g73 around which weighs about 10 pounds!Bottom line - It's a great computer but if I had seen pics of the one I got before, I would not have bought it.  Any time you buy a used or refurb item you take a gamble.Pros:- Lightweight- Great Battery Life- Everything works great, all the I/O ports work- Perfect for getting acquainted with macsCons:- If want to upgrade the ram then you void the warranty ( have to remove sticker to get to ram slot)- Case was scratched (previous owner etched their name on mine and it was not taken care of)- Tech at apple said they couldn't service it because it does not have the original parts - battery, frame around screen, keyboard frame, & mousepad (The one I got was a refurb from wegner media)", "Date": "July 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice", "Author": "Jimbo Macluvins", "ReviewID": "R1I6NGKC34SJLY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was so worried about buying electronics over the enternet.

The cord in particular was a fire hazard!I had just attained my requests, picked it up from the store all new and pretty-and then I lost it to a thief! Fie.I loved this machine.

I could not believe they did not consider the battery as defective so I went to the Apple store myself and asked for a manager.  He explained to me the battery expansion is \"normal\".  Apple doesn't cover battery expansion under any circumstances not even under the Apple Care.  The battery is simply considered \"consumable\" and NOT covered.I asked the manager if he feels comfortable with me posting the picture of the MacBook Air on the internet with the description that Apple doesn't consider the product defective.  His reply astonished me, looking down at me from behind his thick glasses he said: \"Make sure you have your facts straight before you smear! They will contact you.\"  He didn't specify who are \"they\" but from the tone of his voice and his 6'5\" posture it indicated something between the SWAT team and a bunch of LAWYERS.Here is my take on all of this, the business model Apple pushes right now is to get some cheap junk from China, hire a bunch of cheerleaders straight out of high school, call them geniuses, and bully everybody who complains about their product.
