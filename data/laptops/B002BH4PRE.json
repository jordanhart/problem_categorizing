{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very nice notebook - could use a better battery", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "RGN1EH3FRRWP1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a big fan of the HP HDX series.  It sits at the top of their Pavilion line and is one of the best built notebooks sold in the retail channel.  It's aimed solidly at consumers looking for a high end entertainment laptop.  Because the material quality is well above average it's not necessarily the best value: you can get these specs for less money, just not with the same build quality.  This is a good choice for someone looking for a notebook that can handle more than just web browsing.  The biggest drawback of this HDX model is a slightly under powered battery and a little more weight (though again, much of that lies with the superior frame and shell).Let's go over the specs:CPU: The Core 2 P7550 runs two separate cores at 2.26GHz and has 3MB of on chip cache.  The Core2 line is the best notebook CPU out there today and and this model this is about in the middle of the mobile Core2 line in terms of performance.  At 35W it sits in the same thermal envelope as much slower chips (such as the Mobile Pentium line).  Having two cores means you can run your full internet security suite and not have your computer freeze up for events like a virus scan.MEMORY: 4GB of DDR2 RAM is plenty and the 1066Mhz memory speed is plenty fast.HDD: The 500GB HDD has plenty of storage, even if you like to do video encoding.  The 5400RPM speed isn't the fastest but it is more reliable that 7200RPM drives.DISPLAY: The 16in (1366\u00d7768) display looks great.  Like a lot of glossy screens it's a little more susceptible to glare, but in the home it looks fantastic.  There's also a HDX line with an 18inch screen.GRAPHICS: The Nvidia GeForce GT 130M w/ 1GB of DDR2 used in this notebook is a large step up from the standard Intel 4500 graphics.  It is basically a Nvidia 9600 on a newer (55nm) manufacturing process.  With this notebook you can play newer 3D games at reasonable resolutions.  This is still a step down from being a true \"gaming notebook\" but if you want to be able to do occasional 3D gaming on it you can (I should note that online 3D games like World of Warcraft run fine on this chip).  If 3D gaming is important to you I would suggest looking for a notebook with something more powerful (either the Nvidia GTS and GTX line or the ATI 4800 or 4600 series).  It is more than enough to handle your home entertainment needs.  The only downside is it uses more power and will drain your batter faster than the standard 4500.AUDIO: The Altec Lansing with Dolby Home Theater and Sub-Woofer is part of what sets this notebook apart.  The sound is fantastic.  It is rich and deep and has none of the tininess usually associated with notebook sound.DVD/CD DRIVE: Uses the \"HP Super-Multi Drive\" which means it can read and write pretty much any CD or DVD format out there except for Blu Ray.  The lack of Blu Ray is the main ding on the \"entertainment\" specs of notebook.  You can get Blu Ray on other HDX-16 models or by custom ordering it from HP.BATTERY: The 6 cell battery falls a little short.  With this size screen and the upgraded graphics chip you really want a 12 cell battery (which some HDX models have).  If you expect to be plugged in most of the time you probably don't care.  If  you expect to travel with this the 1.5-2 hour typical performance (3 max) will disappoint you.WEIGHT:  Coming in a 7.06 lbs this is slightly heavier than the next step down from HP (a DV6 comes in around 6.5 lbs) but that's mostly improved framing and heavier grade plastics.  This notebook is solid.WIRELESS: The usually Intel 5100 A/G/N supports the most common standards (\"A\" and \"G\") along with the new \"N\" standard.  You should have no trouble connecting to wireless networks.PORTS: This notebook has all the usual ports (USB2, Ethernet, VGA, headphones, microphones, eSATA) and a HDMI port.  Thanks to the included remote you could watch DVDs on your TV (if it supports HDMI) in relative comfort.  I'm not sure why you would want to foor DVDs, but if you want to use Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon Video On Demand, it makes it easy to download and watch movies on your TV.So if you want a solid notebook with good video and sound this is well worth taking a lot at, especially if you want to download movies.  If you are looking for a gaming notebook keep looking.  If you want Blu Ray keep looking.  If you just want to surf the web you don't need a computer this powerful unless you want really good sound.  If battery life is important look for a model with a 12 cell battery (or custom order one from HP).", "Date": "August 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Buy at your own risk", "Author": "Benjamin Riley", "ReviewID": "R21OZ0SW0MLVKW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I originally wrote an extremely in depth review about this computer, but peculiarly enough, it never got published.  Rather than spending hours going through the extreme level of detail I did before, I'll just summarize it by saying I've had two of these now (first one returned for a replacement), and both had 1) dead pixels and 2) a horrible rattling/crackling/blown speaker sound in the right speaker.  Sent it to HP to fix it under warranty, they fixed the pixels and SAID they replaced the speaker, but the terrible rattling is still there.  More troubling, the HP representative tested several of these computers at the repair center and said that they were ALL exhibiting the same problem in the right speaker (which is placed directly over the triple bass) so this may in fact be a MANUFACTURING problem.  For anyone that has this laptop, please test and comment back.Other than that, everything else is fine (minus the horrid amount of bloatware that comes on this thing).  But I find it unacceptable for something that calls itself an ENTERTAINMENT laptop to be plagued by audio and video hardware flaws.", "Date": "September 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Looking for a desktop replacement? This is for you!", "Author": "Jeffrey Sinckler", "ReviewID": "R6LH0BJVB3DTA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a laptop that I could use as a mobile desktop. I do work everyday on my desktop and I needed a machine that could do what my desktop can do on the go. I have owned this machine for almost two weeks now and it has been great. The high-powered processor working alongside the high amounts of ram allow me to surf the web, do my work and computer programming, and listen to my internet radio all at the same time with no slow down at all. The hard drive is huge, so I was able to install all of my large-sized programs with no problem at all. The webcam is very good and produces a clear picture when I chat with my family and friends. Aside from performance, it looks great with its shiny titanium finish and the screen is big, bright, and clear.My suggestion to anyone who is planning on buying this laptop is to get a 12-cell battery as so that you can get a little more life out of the machine. With the standard battery included with the laptop, it lasts about 1.5 - 2 hours. With the 12-cell, I got 3 - 3.5.One last note... all of the computers that I have owned up until now were running 32-bit versions of windows, so I was hesitant to get a 64-bit machine. However, 64-bit machines are not that different from 32-bit machines. You won't even be able to tell the difference. (Just make sure that when you install software, you pick the 64-bit version if necessary. Some installers will differentiate for you, but just be on the lookout.Overall, this is a great machine and i would suggest it to others.", "Date": "September 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "A very Good Elementary School Laptop", "Author": "jerryluiz", "ReviewID": "R1FFXI3JYJ4M7R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I Made a very bad choice of buying this laptop for my business. A few days of use and in the middle of a presentation to my potential clients, the \"adjust sound stop play forward\" Controls started coming up automatically on my screen along with an annoying clicking sound. No Software update from HP and Microsoft would fix it. Finally, I found out from some online forums that its due to an oversensitive MEDIASMART touch panel that picks up static charges and interpreting it as human touch. A Kid suggested that I put some scotch MAGIC tape on the MEDIASMART bar and that fixed it. It even works with the tape on it.!! Next, It has a Glare friendly screen , which no matter what angle you are watching at, makes it tough to work in a room illuminated with natural daylight. You need to be in a very dimly lit room to use this screen, and then you realize that its hard to read the keys on the keyboard. Avoid this Amateur laptop for business use. Maybe a its good buy for your elementary school kid to watch ELMO or Mickey mouse movies and perhaps to write on the screen with Crayons!!", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "HP HDX16 Review", "Author": "Eugene S. Anderson", "ReviewID": "R1Z9C8C87V1NUG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've had the HDX 16 for several years now and the problems I encounter keep adding up.  The first problems I encountered with the laptop were problems with the touch buttons below the screen. The touch buttons enable the user to change the volume or play/rewind/stop media and other useful things. The volume button and treble/bass buttons have a fancy bar that looks like it should indicate the current volume level but don't. The buttons are also a bit slow and unresponsive and may cause frustration with needing to hit the button twice or toggling something on and off accidentally.  The second problem I encountered was with HP software. There is a lot of HP software, but the only piece of software I liked, the webcam software disappeared. I don't know how or when but one day I went to click my desktop shortcut to the webcam software and it was gone.  The third and fourth problems introduced themselves to me as I began installing and playing games on the HDX. The third problem is that the graphics card sucks. I had problems tabbing between a full screen game back to the desktop. Additionally the graphics card fails A LOT. Even playing simple internet flash games can cause the graphics card to crash and force me to stare at a blank screen for a minute as it recovers, not to mention actual computer games. Everyday I visit NVIDIAs site checking for new updates hoping the problem will be solved, and it still hasn't.  The fourth problem is the laptop cooling system. Even the first day I used my laptop I noticed a build up of heat on the left side of the laptop. Just doing simple tasks such as typing on Microsoft word or writing a negative review on Amazon I feel an abnormal amount of heat. Now this wouldn't be a big problem if I didn't play computer games. Unfortunately this is an \"entertainment laptop\" and I am a teenage boy and computer games are my pride and joy. I started to play Napoleon Total War and after about 10-30 minutes BAM computer shuts off. I felt my laptop and it was scalding hot. I know you might be thinking I mistook the word laptop as a computer I can sit on my lap. However, I have a cooling pad for my laptop and it STILL overheats when I play graphic intensive video games. The only compromise I have been able to find besides tying my laptop to the ceiling and letting in dangle in mid air is to let about half the laptop hang over the edge of a desk. This is the ONLY way I have been able to prevent my HDX from overheating when I play games.  Overall I know this review has been a bit negative but it is these 4 things that of slowly driven me insane while having this laptop. I mean it really drives me insane not to be able to play my laptop anywhere without hanging it off the side of a desk. I am thinking about calling HP and asking what I can do, and maybe bringing my laptop into a techie shop and getting an upgraded fan. Bottom line is this is my experience with my laptop. I don't know if all other laptops experience this problem but if they don't I recommend you forget about the HDX and go with a laptop that doesn't have a fail graphics card and overheats on a flat surface.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "HP I WOULDNT RECOMMEND", "Author": "John W. Mccain III \"J McCain\"", "ReviewID": "R3OCPQ1E9N6Q3G", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "You know, I have been a huge supporter of HP laptops for as long as I can remember.  This was my fourth HP Laptop going back about 9 years in all.  The first two still worked fine when I bought the third they were just to slow and technology on laptop advances lead me to buying a new one.  My Third Hp Laptop was amazing, light weight, good battery life, performance wasnt the best but still did everything I needed it to do but after 4 years and three deployments to the middle east the sand and crappy power finally got to it.  Then came this Laptop, figured I would splurge and spend good money to get a Laptop that was capable of playing games at that time, would have a decent battery life and I was really looking for the HD screen along with the Blu Ray player.  I spent nearly $1.600 on this laptop along with the docking station, TV Tuner which has never worked and an extra battery.  Boy what a waste that was, the original battery exploded after 3 months, then the Blu Ray quit working, the docking station still works great but the laptop not so much.  Now I have the Audio an wireless functions pop up on the screen randomly and you cant do a dang thing on the laptop while this is going so you have to wait for the computer to stop acting stupid.  The wireless turns off by itself without every touching anything and the thing heats up so fast and the cooling system sucks.  Called HP and well wish I could understand a word they said, replaced Blu Ray it works sometimes, Battery warranty was only 90 days go figure and well the audio and wireless problem there is no fix for without sending in for Mother board replacement.  I will not be buying a HP computer ever again, the build quality is marginal at best, the customer service well cant say how good or bad it is not a single person speaks english or even decent broken english for that matter.  I am done with HP for ever and this from a devoted HP consumer.  How about making products some were else besides communist China and getting people that speak english for crying out loud.", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worth every penny", "Author": "Zach S.", "ReviewID": "R12JCLAJU9BLLG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this baby about a year ago, and I have to say, this thing is a beast.

What I needed was a computer that could run mainly AutoCad and other heavy programs with ease. I've always enjoyed this laptop, one for it's design, and the other for it's ability to accommodate my flexible needs. This is currently still my daily computer, it is definitely reaching an age where purchasing a new computer is going to be a reasonable option. Never had to many problems, vista was a joke i'm operating windows 7 now and LOVE IT! Computer is much more responsive than before. A super recent upgrade I did was upgrading to the maximum amount of RAM and now I see I should have made the switch way earlier! With my recent upgrades including maximizing RAM and increasing HD disk space to 1tb this computer should last me at least another year and a half if not longer. I have noticed it's a little bulkier than products hitting the floors recently but the design really keeps people guessing. Quickly would like to touch on the \"MediaSmart\" bar located above the keyboard which has been mentioned in other reviews. It does have issues time to time, I make sure to have the correct updated drivers installed and usually I don't have problems but sometimes using these \"touch\" buttons can be a real hassle. Umm lets see, computer gets pretty warm during use and what you have it set on. I now have a 12 cell battery which lifts my laptop off whatever resting surface by about 3/4 of an inch which increases air flow. It was noticed a lot using vista but with windows 7 I haven't had anything worth too much concern. Overall I enjoy this computer, It's been used  A TOONNNN during the last about to be 5 years! and yet no major problems. Obviously as my first laptop I do not have much knowledge to compare it too from other brands per say, but I can say it worked for me and was very reliable .. upgrade that RAM!", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect laptop ever created", "Author": "Tony Tran", "ReviewID": "R2MNMCTWMY42YE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been using this laptop for 3 years since it was bought from America until a month ago with few acceptable troubles, it had been my best technology friend over the past few years, supporting me every thing from university coursework, job and obviously, entertainment, and it looks amazingly stylish too. Until the last day i could ever use this dear laptop, it had been scratched a bit over the touchpad and sometimes got into troubles in terms of keyboards and heavy weight. However, weight and size are what manufacturers reveal before you decide to buy it, so one should never complain about this all-in-one laptop. Although the original design of the keyboard doesn't make it durable, yet all the keys are fully functional and well used. Back into 2009 i was so proud of having owned a laptop like this, and even until the day it was stolen, my satisfaction of consuming this product had always been proliferated.(May be because the laptop was too good and irresitable). Software that come with the Hp laps are always satisfactory as well. Customer service was okey. So benefits actually outweigh. In terms of software and specs, it's still well compatible with all the Windows and most of the designing, programming purposes, also HD movies, even if you are a heavy gamer. The only trouble seems to be dealt with the heat, but HP nowadays develops effective coolsense. I felt in love with the laptop since the first commercial and will never regret of having owned a product like this, and will buy another one for entertaining purpose in the future.

The sound output is ok for everyday use but if you are a music enthusiastic like me, you might want to invest in desktop speakers + subwoofers. You might also want to get a cooling pad because the laptop heats up, though this depends on the kinda work you are doing. One concern for me is the battery life.....it lasts for just above an hour. Another concern is not hp's but microsoft's.....VISTA! It (Vista) uses a lot of resources. Ive been in college for over two months and this laptop has only been off for about 72hours roughly. It has handled everything i have thrown at it so far. Another cool feature is the finger print reader....i hadly type in my passwords online anymore. i just use the finger print reader.

After six months the screen failed and showed many lines and some black areas.  This was just for normal operation of opening and closing the screen led.  No force or pressure applied on the screen or lid to open and close.  If you don't hold on the places that HP has not identified, you may crack the internal LCD components.  It is simply a poor quality design for expected operation.  HP blames it on the customer and does not honor their product quality.  After paying for replacement part plus labor, it will still be the same poor quality component.  Failure as the result of poor design for durability is blamed as damaged by consumer (operator).  I recommend Dell or Toshiba for much sturdier and well built design.

It's the quick-ship model from HP, HDX-114OUS.Pros:  The screen is what first got me hooked on this laptop.  I wanted a big screen because I'm an engineering student and need alot of room for my CAD programs.  the 16\" infinity view does the trick.  The full size keyboard is a plus, it does sag a millimeter or two when you use the number pad, but its nothing horrendous at all.  I really like the multimedia touch-sensitive buttons on it.  They include all of the normal video/audio playback commands (rewind, stop, play, pause, forward), along with eject, mute, wifi on/off, and a touch/slide control for both volume, and tampering with the treble and bass of the audio.  Speakers are very good, although I don't use them much anymore, because I have my laptop hooked up to a 1000W surround sound theater system.  Touchpad works nice, along with the buttons, but it along with the wrist rests are a fingerprint and sweat magnet.  The fingerprint scanner is an ingenious design.  You can input up to 10 fingers I think to be recognized to log into your account.  It also works for logging into online accounts, but only on Internet Explorer.  I use Google Chrome so it doesn't work, but its not that much of a turn off.  The three usb ports are a plus, I use one for my mouse that has an extremely small usb wireless receiver which stays in the port when I travel.  The eSATA port is also a plus if you have an eSATA capable external hard drive, since it blows USB out of the water with its speed.  I don't use the ethernet connection, but could if I wanted to.  HDMI out is very nice, I use a 25ft 22AWG HDMI cable from Monoprice to hook up to my 1080i tv with no lag whatsoever.  VGA out works fine with a 21.5\" LCD monitor I just bought from HP.  It originally came with Windows Vista, but took advantage of a student deal and bought Windows 7 for $30, and works a whole lot faster.  You'll probably never use up the whole 4GB of RAM put into this beast, I've only been able to get it up to 3.75 when running multiple high performance programs, which would never be running simultaneously under normal conditions.  The mini remote is a plus, it works from at least 10ft away for watching movies.Cons:  The only thing I don't like is the bulkiness and the terrible battery life, which I know are both just a result of it being so big and powerful.  I went ahead and bought an aftermarket 12cell (I think) battery which gives me probably 3.5 hours on high power easily.
