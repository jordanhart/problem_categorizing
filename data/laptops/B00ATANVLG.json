{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great laptop/ultrabook.", "Author": "Lapenne", "ReviewID": "R2YPUCFYNXIMZL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this after a real Odyssey searching for a new ultrabook. I owned the Samsung series 9, np900x3c, and my girlfriend has a Macbook Air (MBA), so I can also compare them to the Yoga.At this price, the Yoga is a great product if:- you want a great quality ultrabook (parts are solid and well made and it is not as fragile as the Samsung 9).It is not as light as others but unless you really need an ultraportable (like the Samsung 9) then the Yoga fares well as it weights just 0.3 lbs more than the MBA although it is a little bigger.About the latter, it is sturdier in some sense than both the MBA and Samsung. The MBA actually delivers a good solid feeling (the Series 9 not much so, I felt like you can break it easily, especially the hinges of the screen) but I feel like I could drop the Yoga without having to say goodbye to it. I believe this is in Lenovo spirit, their laptop are renowned to be sturdy and long-lasting.- good quality control (my first the Samsung 9 came with a dead pixel, the second one had a crappy trackpad which selects things at random while you move the cursor and statics from the speakers and audio output!).- a great touchscreen, also in terms of quality of the LCD display (IPS with decent resolution). Notice that touchscreens reduce battery performance. The Samsung 9 has a brighter screen and more battery life, especially compared if you use the screen at the same level of brightness. That was a drawback for the Yoga to me, because I don't care about the touchscreen. However, overall, considering features and design, quality control, and price (!!) the Yoga wins easily.- a good keyboard. It is not as good as the X1 Carbon, but it definitely beats the MBA (which has a decent keyboard but shallower than the Yoga) and wins hands down the Series 9 (stiff, shallow and noisy).IT IS RELLY A GREAT ULTRABOOK FOR THE PRICE with the competition out there at the moment.You can also upgrade the RAM and SSD easily enough (especially the RAM, it's trivial).What I would like to see improved in the future, in order of importance, are:- battery life! If you use 80-85% brightness and use it constantly (I mostly browse, type quite a bit -- coding for example -- and listening to some music) you might even wipe it in just 4 hours. That's not awesome. The Series 9 would last 1 hour longer. However, the battery is decent, don't let yourself down because of this. The OS and features drains the battery, the MBA would last 3 hours if it had a touchscreen like this and was running Win 8!- more brightness and bigger screen (the MBA has a slightly bigger screen but worse resolution and quality, that's for sure).- An even better keyboard, like the X1 Carbon thinkpad (with the nipple please!)- I would prefer a metal case in terms of design. It would make it just awesome.- Back-lit keyboard.NOTE: I don't use the touchscreen much but the factor forms are really useful. Many times you are in a vehicle, or on the plane, or in a situation where you need to bend the laptop and use it with the screen closer to you, taking up less space and such. It is really useful! I love to use it on the couch and bed as tablet (otherwise a little heavy). Even if you don't love the touchscreen and would rather have a better battery life and lighter product (like I do), the Yoga still wins to such product like MBA and Samsung 9 because of its features and quality, for that competitive price!", "Date": "February 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Here's the truth", "Author": "P. Stephen", "ReviewID": "R2YAS6USW484NZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I read enough reviews on Amazon and other places to justify me having to write one here.  First things first, I am an IT guy, so between hardware, software and networking it's easier for me to figure things out, so keep that in mind when reading the review.As all of the other reviewers said, there are some known quirks with this computer.  Yes, the hinges let the screen wobble a bit.  I have a Dell XPS 13 and the screen doesn't wobble at all, but this one does.  It's not a big deal.  Secondly, yes, the keyboard is different.  The keys don't appear to be as deep as other keyboards, so when pressing them down it isn't as much as a confirmed response back from the pc.  That being said, I don't have a single problem typing on it outside of the backspace key being small.  A few hours later and it's fine.  The mouse is perfect fine for me.  I actually prefer it over my Dell mouse.  There are times when the tapping or click of the mouse doesn't respond, but it isn't to the point of annoyance.  You can two finger scroll, two finger right click, pinch, zoom, etc all with it.  I actually do like it.The one I wanted to spend a little bit of time on is the wireless card.  This thing is 2.4 ghz only.  It's speed is limited to 150 mbps.  My pc out of the box didn't have any driver issues, but for some reason when I installed the latest driver from the lenovo site, I couldn't get online anymore, so I had to rollback that driver.  There is a combination of bad drivers, software and network requirements needed to make this thing work.  Again, out of the box I was only able to connect at 65 mbps on my cisco frontier router.  My xps 13 connects at 300 mbps.  Obviously this is a Lenovo issue.  What I did was turn off the suspend mode for the wireless card, then set my router to channel 11, upper threshold with 40 mhz width.  That poppped me back up to 150 mbps on the wireless card.  Unfortunately it took me about 3 to 4 hours with all the troubleshooting to get the answer.The good.  The screen is exceptional.  The icons are glorious and it's even better in tablet mode.  I'm not sure if the colors are right given that the white background has a bit of wash in it (like on this page), but when I look at this screen and then go back to my XPS 13, you can clearly see the difference.  Tablet mode is also good and I was initially worried about the keyboard being on the bottom, but it's actually not a big deal at all.  What I didn't like was when you have the pc in presentation mode (bent back 75%), the keyboard and mouse aren't turned off like they are in tablet mode, so you have to put it on a flat surface or it will start going nuts.In summary, I'm not sure the pc is worth the $899 asking price that Amazon has it for considering all the tweaks that have to be done to it, but at a lower price, this computer may be worth the money.  It's fast, the screen is gorgeous and the battery lasts a decent amount of time.  Hopefully this review helps as all the other ones on Amazon did help me.**Update 7/1/13**Well, I must have been premature in my review.  There are a few things wrong with this laptop I can't get over: 1) The fan runs constantly and it gets too hot.  I literally start sweating with it on my lap if I'm watching a movie or using something intense like adobe flash player 2) The keyboard is absolutely terrible.  The keys stick and aren't firm enough.  Moreover, the flex in the keyboard itself makes it even worse to type.  It feels like the engineers at Lenovo only typed on this laptop standing up, because the keyboard is virtually useless on the lap. 3) While the wifi card works, it has to be the lowest end possible.  I only get 130mbps while my dell xps 12 gets 300 with ease.  The data transfer rate is 10x on the XPS and in order to get those speeds, I have to plug in the Lenovo to a usb-to-ethernet adapter.  At first I was willing to accept this issue, but after using the pc in a hotel with weak wifi connections, it wasn't worth it.The pc is going back to Amazon as we speak. What a shame, because if they fixed the fan and spent a few more $$ on the keyboard/wifi, this pc would sell like hotcakes...", "Date": "June 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Detailed review from a techy", "Author": "Y. Zhou", "ReviewID": "R1LQFAM125SXAB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a big computer enthusiast, and I have went through a lot of laptops/ultrabooks over the past few years. I have owned:-Macbook pros and airs-Asus Zenbook ux31a-Dell XPS 13-Dell Latitude-netbooks and other lesser known notebooks.My favorite out of the bunch was the Asus zenbook ux31a, and it still is if I am talking solely about ultrabooks. I prefer the yoga because of the touchscreen and future-proofing Windows 8 OS. I never really owned any powerful gaming laptops because I have a very powerful desktop sitting at home.So now you know my techy background, here is my list of pros and cons for the Lenovo Yoga 13 after using it for about a week.PROS:1. Windows 8 on a touchscreen. I used Win8 on my XPS 13, which does not have a touchscreen, and I absolutely hated the experience, especially considering the XPS has a subpar touchpad. I think Win8 gets a lot of hate because people use it on a non-touch laptops. Using Win8 on a touchscreen laptop is very fluid and natural. Even in the traditional desktop mode, I can tell they made a lot of adjustments in the OS to make it work well. I do have some problems with the virtual keyboard not popping up sometimes when I needed it to. At rare times, it would even pop up when I don't need it.2. Screen. 900p IPS glossy display. Not as good as the zenbook's 1080p IPS matte display, but the difference is not noticeable.3. Touchpad. Some reviews say the touchpad is terrible. I actually like it quite a lot, and this is coming from someone who used the Macbook's touchpad for years. I like the zenbook ux31a's trackpad more, but just by a hair.4. Construction. There are cons in the build quality (listed in cons section), but overall, it is a solid design. The entire laptop scheme of the construction is rubber. You can feel the rubbery friction on the top and bottom of the laptop, as well as inside on the trackpad and even between the letters of the keyboard. I am guessing they went with rubber instead of aluminum or some other metal is because the laptop is already heavy enough, and they did not want to add more weight to it especially since it's an oversized tablet. Also, the rubber makes for a good grip in tablet mode, something necessary for such a large tablet.5. Battery life. Yoga 13 has the best battery life out of all the ultrabook/tablet hybrids to date (according to my knowledge at least). This is one of the main reasons I bought this over the XPS 12. HOWEVER, the battery life is still subpar compared to non-touchscreen ultrabooks like the zenbook or macbook air. I get about 5-6 hours, but I have pushed it to close to 7 hours if you use it very conservatively.CONS:1. Construction. As I said in the PROS section, there are pros and cons about the construction. I like the rubber scheme design, but there are some flex in the keyboard, making the overall product feel less premium. The size of the screen bezel is thick for my taste (I am spoiled by the XPS 13 thin bezel). The bezel size also increases the overall size of the laptop, and the width and length makes it much larger than my old xps 13, and is also actually larger than my old macbook pro 13. The size combined with the the thickness makes it noticeably heavier than my old zenbook and macbook air.2. No backlit keyboard. The keyboard itself is alright, I am typing this review on it right now. The top of the keys are straight while the bottom is curved, which feels kind of weird to me, so my touch typing feels slightly off, but no biggie.3. Bad factory partitioning, easy/automated fix can be found online. Google \"Yoga 13 hotfix\"4. Fan. It does seem to be on all the time, but you won't notice it because it's a quiet hum. I only noticed it when I'm alone in my room, and even then it never bothers me. There may be a \"fix\" online, but I never looked into it.5. Hard for User Upgrades. This can be argued to be a PRO considering a lot of ultrabooks doesn't even give you the option to upgrade anymore. Anyways, It's kind of complicated to upgrade the SSD. I haven't read too much into it, but I think it's doable, just not your traditional HDD/SSD swap. Also, it only has 1 RAM slot, so the max you can upgrade to is 8gb right now.6. Hard to open! This is probably my biggest everyday gripe about it. I'm not sure what Lenovo was thinking. When the yoga is closed, there's a strong magnet to hold it in place. You definitely can't open it easily with one hand like you can with macbooks and the new zenbook. You'll probably have to use 2 hands. Furthermore, there is no LEVERAGE for you to hold onto! You basically use one hand to try and keep it down while using your other hand to pry it open, except they didn't make any sort of space you can get your fingers under for a good grip. It's a very slipper experience. This might be the hardest laptop I have ever used to open, mainly because of the strong magnet. I actually have to give a little attention to and focus whenever I want to open it up.*I did not experience any bad wifi problems.OVERALL, I do enjoy this Yoga. The PROS still outweigh the cons. The 2 biggest thing I look at in a laptop is the trackpad and screen because that's what people use the most, both are outstanding on the Yoga. While in laptop mode, it looks like a normal 13inch laptop, kind small and portable. But as soon as you use it in a tablet mode, its perception becomes a super huge tablet with tons of screen real estate...mind tricks. Anyways, I do like the machine a lot. I picked the yoga over the microsoft surface because I believe the keyboard and trackpad is an essential part of using a full-fledged windows machine. I can't see myself playing games or doing real work on the Surface even with the keyboard cover,  too small and cramped.Do I recommend you to buy this? I never recommend buying a first generation product. They are usually glitchy and highly priced. If you know you want a touchscreen laptop, get this. Buy the Surface if you really want portability with less battery life and screen estate. Otherwise, I would say to wait for the 2nd or 3rd generation. I can see Yoga 13 #2 having a thinner bezel, and a thinner body, lighter design, and longer battery life, maybe even a higher res screen. Hopefully, retail pricing will also start below 1k.", "Date": "March 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best convertible laptop currently on the market", "Author": "ENDY", "ReviewID": "R28N5UICJG7CWP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Yoga 13 is an excellent computer, which works (almost) exactly as it should (with one minor wifi fix). My real rating would be 4.5 stars, but I'm rounding up because this is a 1st-Generation device, so small bugs are usually common.  I've compared it extensively with the Dell XPS 12 and opted to keep the Yoga 13, even though I got the Dell for the same price ($1,000 for a Dell-refurbished unit + a coupon).Design (9 out of 10)The 360 hinge works as it should, with one minor complaint.  The screen is a little bit \"bouncy\" when you have the laptop open at all and try to write on it with a stylus, which means you need to either have the screen \"open\" all the way and flat on a surface or you need to stabilize it with your other hand to use a stylus well. The Dell XPS 12 hinge does not have this same problem.  However, overall, I slightly prefer the Yoga 13 design to the Dell XPS 12 design.  In fact, I now find it silly to have a laptop with a touch screen that doesn't open all the way.  The double joint feature that allows the fold back really can't cost more than $20 or $30; every laptop should have it. The criticism about the keys being exposed is blown way out of proportion.  It feels a little funny at first, but that's it.  Don't set your laptop down on a dirty, wet, or sticky surface and the keyboard will be just fine.The one main advantage of the Dell XPS 12 design is that you can leave the base completely stationary and flip the screen.  If the laptop is plugged in, this is handy.  Still, the flip screen design on the Dell feels a little gimmicky (although it's still a fine alternative design to the Yoga 13 and much better than the Twist, in my opinion).The overall feel of the Yoga is nice.  It is not \"premium\" like the Dell XPS 12 carbon fiber, but it's not worth paying extra money for a slightly nicer texture, in my opinion.  I actually prefer the interior texture on the Yoga 13 -- very comfortable typing handrests that don't get cold or hot.Screen (9 out of 10)The screen looks very nice; the 1600x900 resolution works very well for a 13 inch screen.  Side by side with the Dell XPS 12's 1080p, it's clear that the Dell has a better-looking screen.  However, the resolution on the Dell is a bit high for a 12 inch screen, which means you need to increase font sizes for most text to be readable without squinting.Touch/Tablet mode (10 out of 10)This is where the Yoga 13 demolishes the Dell.  If you plan to use a stylus and are considering the Dell please read this, since I've not seen it come up in any reviews.  The Dell XPS 12 is unusable in stylus mode.  I tried two different Dell units with the exact same results: jagged lines, missed lines, and illegible text if I tried to write anything small.  This occurred in every program (One Note, Word, Corel Draw, Note Anytime), and 6 hours with tech support could not fix it (new OS, new drivers, etc.).  The Yoga 13, on the hand, works quite well (although I would pay an extra $150 for a active stylus with digitizer -- Lenovo, are you listening?).Tablet mode has worked great, with no problems.  With the Dell, I had problems with auto-rotate and auto-keyboard pop-up failing to work on two different Dell units.  The only fix was a complete re-install of windows.For some who have noted that there is sometimes a lag in the touch screen if you haven't used it for a while, follow these steps (found on a message board):- Open device manager- Expand Human Interface DevicesAt the bottom of the HID list are two devices labeled \"USB Input Device\"  On my system, the one we're concerned with is the second one, so the last item in the list, but just to make sure it's the right one:- Open the device properties- Click the Details tab- In the drop down menu, select Hardware IdsThe one we want will say USB\\VID_04F3&PID;_000A on the second line- Move to the Power Management tab- Uncheck \"Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power\"Keyboard/Trackpad (9 out of 10)Trackpad is great (I updated to latest drivers).  Not sure what the mixed reviews are about.  The Dell XPS 12 was not good.  Keyboard on the Yoga is also great.  I liked the feel of the Dell's keyboard a bit more, but I've had no missed keys on the Yoga.I don't understand the criticism of lack of keyboard backlight.  I've never had a scenario where I needed keyboard backlighting.  In completely dark room, the computer screen illuminates the keyboard enough to see the keys.  But if you really love keyboard backlighting, be aware that the Yoga 13 doesn't have it!Wifi (7 out of 10)While it sounds like some people are having bigger problems with wifi, my failure-to-reconnect on log-on issue was solved with this simple fix: Go to Device Manager (Charms Bar --> search for \"Device Manager\" in settings), Go to Network Adapter, Right Click on the RealTek, Click on Advanced Tab, Then set Selective Suspend to \"Disabled.\"Since I did that, I've had zero problems. It annoys me that Lenovo could ship a product that needs a fix for wifi that automatically reconnects at log-on, but the range issues people have been reporting are non-existent for me.  In fact, for both my home network and work network, I have 3-4 bars of wifi in places where my Dell XPS 12 had 1-2 bars and would fail to connect at times.  Since my fix, I've had zero wifi problems in the past 3 weeks.Ports/Other Features (10 out of 10)I like the full-size HDMI port.  While DisplayPorts might be the future, everything in my house has HDMI (and HDMI to DVI cables are $6 on Amazon, if you have a monitor without HDMI).  No VGA port, though, which is fine for me since it is no longer 2005.SD card slot is nice.  Seems silly that Dell left it out of the XPS 12.Expandable SSD slot is amazing.  I have a 128GB Yoga now, but it's nice knowing I'll be able to add a second SSD in the future as prices drop (see YouTube for instructions).  Also, I plan to expand to 8GB of ram, although I've had no problems with 4GB for the time being.Not happy about the charger (the unique style means I have to pay top dollar for a replacement, since I like to have two), but it works fine.Final ThoughtsThe upcoming Helix could rival the Yoga in terms of design (detachable screen, 10 hours of batter life, stylus), but if you're like me and do a decent amount of typing, an 11-inch screen is just too small.  The Yoga 13's 13-inch screen is just right for productivity, and in tablet mode works really well on your lap.  No, you can't hold it with one hand comfortably, but you can prop it up in a variety of ways.  I find the 9-11 inch tablet size to be nice, but also too large for one-handed use.  I hope the next version of the Yoga has an active stylus.", "Date": "March 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Favorite Laptop So Far", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"'The Dark Is Rising' by Susa...", "ReviewID": "R1RU5I6L9IPBGM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this laptop for two months now and I love this computer. I mostly use my laptop for watching my digital movies, constantly searching the web, writing, reading and also use (very rarely) to play pc games. I will tell you that I highly recommend this computer despite any flaws I have found. So while this review my be a little bias I tried keeping with the facts only.The Yoga's Flexibility~Note: Flipping the laptop to each stage is very easy but also sturdy in any position you put it in. I have never had a problem in flipping, but I will make a note that it does automatically snap close if you push it to far down (about a centimeter) towards the keyboard, so to avoid damage (though unlikely) please do not push is partially closed and take you hand off and let is snap close. 1. Notebook/Laptop Stage: I use this one the most because I was looking for a laptop mostly and a tablet second. If this is something you are also looking for than this would be perfect for you. The keyboard is great. Easy to type and spacious without being difficult to reach other keys anywhere on the board. In fact, I make less spelling mistakes on this keyboard than on any other laptop I have ever had. The mouse is something I have had to get use to though. I do not like the clickers being fused with the touch pad. I go to far down and my mouse will not longer move and I'm click on a link that is an advertisement without me realizing it. Or I will start of hitting the clicker when I just wanted to move the pointer out of the way of text and end up highlighting an entire paragraph. This can be very frustrating, but I hope to get more use to it as time goes by. 2. Tablet/Touchscreen: I mostly use this when I'm playing a game or I am reading and want to view just the screen. I love the touch screen on this computer. I got addicted to it right away. It's really sensitive. When I want to click on a particular small link cluttered together with other small links it always gets it right. The only problem I have with the tablet view is that it's hard to carry around with the keyboard under it. You have to grip it from the corners by the mouse for maximum support. Lucky, you can have this support on top or bottom of the tablet as you can turn it anyway you want. I will like to note that even if you hit any of the keys it will not effect what the screen does as the keyboard will automatically lock. 3. Tent: Probably my favorite way of watching movies. This is something you would love it you are in the kitchen cooking along with a cook show you are streaming from the internet or if you just want the background noise while working on something else. I have use it's for reading as well. 4. Stand: Also a great way to watch movies, but with the added addition of being able to aim the screen in any angle you want. I have used this to watch movies on my back with the laptop on my chest with the screen angled down. Also good for setting the laptop up somewhere high and out of the way of anything/anyone my damage but still able to see what is playing clearly.Weight~3.3 pounds. Easily able to pick it up with one hand without strain. Makes caring the tablet version easier without hitting keys in the back.Fan/Heating~Fan is quiet, the only time I hear it is when there is no sound and it sound like a really small fan. Hardly noticeable. I also like the placing of the fan. All the laptops I have owned, the fan has always been on the bottom (causing the laptop to overheat in my lap or table) but because of the flipping you can do with the laptop, the fan is on the back edge which keeps the whole computer cooler. As for the heating itself I have had it in my bare lap for hours and not once was it unbearable or overly hot. I would say that it can get pretty warm though.Problems Switching from Tablet to Notebook~I have noticed that there are some switching problems when flipping from tablet to laptop forms. There are times when I touch the screen on a page for typing such as this review (after switching back to the notebook after having it in tablet form) and the onscreen keyboard will pop up instead of having just the text pointer blink there; not being able to use the pointer/touchpad and having to use the touch screen to click on what I want; or the keyboard will continue to be locked after taking it out of tablet form. I have not notice any problems switching from notebook to tablet, just the other way around. All around these are minor problems as I can still do what I need to do using the touch screen or by restarted the computer which literally only takes a minute.Battery Life~I would average it about 4 to 6 hours of continuous web browsing and movie watching.Screen Quality/Stereo Sound~I am watching The Avengers on it right now. The visual is amazing and clear in any form and at any angle. As for the sound, I have not had a problem with it. I wouldn't say I'm an expert on sound quality but this is also very clear. It also gets loud for notebook speakers.Storage/Space~I have never been good a looking a computer space and knowing what I can fit on there just by looking at the ram so I will just say that I fit right out of the package, 6 full length movies such as Batman The Dark Knight, 40 home videos (all under 10 minutes), 500-1,000 songs, 50 or so pictures, and 30 or so word documents. As well as the two games I downloaded from the Windows Store and the apps. No extra memory was added for me and no extra memory is needed.If there is anything you want to ask me about specifically please don't hesitate. Please note that have stated I am watching The Avengers as I was typing this so please excuse misplaced/misspelled words or incomplete sentences. :)", "Date": "March 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Machine", "Author": "Anasaurus", "ReviewID": "R1S80XUBVEFS54", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've never been so excited to use a laptop. Very solid construction and the slightly above average screen resolution really shines on this machine.

I actually like the 13.3 big screen for tablet compared to my asus transformer prime, which is about 10 inches. The keyboard is not that bothering on landscape mode for the tablet. The screen is also very bright. For the fan noise, it is really not noticeable if I do not put my ear to the keyboard. The computer is always below 50 celcus degrees. So I am confident that the computer will not burn,compared to my dell xps m1330,which can lead to 90 celcus degrees easily. So really happy with my purchase and I will keep it as my main computer. I would like to upgrade the hard drive for another 256 gb in short time.-----------------------------------------original review:I have been waiting for a windows 8 laptop since last June when my dell xps M1330 dies of heat.  Many windows 8 ultrabook is out since last October. I mainly target for the laptop but occasional tablet (because windows 8 is VERY short of good apps). For a laptop, I do not want the screen to be too small . So I leave out Samsung Smart PC and MS Surface Pro. I also leave out Asus Zenbook Prime and Samsung Series 9 because they are not able to be served as tablet at all.Thus, the only left option is actually Yoga 13 and Thinkpad Twist. However, the twist is  too old styled and do not look cool. Therefore, I finally decided on Yoga 13, which I have researched a lot online. The main  cons are not-so-good tablet because you grab to keyboards and the fan noise.  The fan noise could be just bios stetting but also could resulting from the fact that the fan hitting the metal housing (which make a very loud noise). Keyboard is not my concern but fan noise does, because a flawed fan can in the long-term burn your machine.  I thought that lenovo should have updated their fan because the the laptop has been out about 3 months. So I ordered from Amazon when it is first out.I got it yesterday and clearly, the fan noise is still there. The FAN runs 100% all the time. I can also hear that the fan is hitting something if I stay in a quiet room and listen carefully.

I will wait for a few days and update my experiences. Because Amazon does not have the model in stock, I will not be able to exchange for another one.Except for the fan noise design flaw, the YOGA 13 is mainly for people who want a new laptop but with occasional tablet function.

The tablet and tent mode fit in well in terms of how i use the machine to surf, scan mails, make presentations. Both when using a table and when using the machine off your lap. I am a light tablet user and a heavy laptop user of predominantly Office and a browser. Even my mails are all webmail. So this works great for my lifestyle of combining a tab with a laptop. Battery life is really good - i do not have an exact number, but currently looks like it should last me about 5-6 hours.Not so great: Although the Yoga is highly advertised in India, getting accessories in India is virtually impossible - the custom case, a screen guard, etc. The touch is sometimes a bit annoying and not as responsive and intuitive as say an iPad. The keypad too while a huge improvement from previous Windows based machines, it still is not a responsive and user friendly as say an Air. The biggest drawback however is the Windows App Store. The app store is lousy at best. The quality and quantity of apps is abysmal in comparison to Apple/Android. Hopefully the coming months should change that. Another slight challenge im facing is that in tent mode, if i plug in a VGA (using an HDMI to VGA adaptor), while the presentation on the screen is straight, the image on the screen is upside down !!

It will have an even better screen (hard to imagine for me), slightly better battery life, and a few more minor improvements, but nothing too major. Look online for comparisons and see whether the improvements are worth the extra money.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I love this computer and there are plenty of good reviews here and on the web to explain why. I love it much more than I expected--basically it is a fanstastic laptop that can also work as a mediocre tablet. I also love setting up as a stand because I hook it to my stereo system and use it for that. The touch screen--and even better, Lenovo's motion control that lets you use motion so you can change the music without gettting dirty hands on the gorgeous screen--is great for the kind of multimedia use. Tent mode is great for that.I'm also a professor and as someone who writes for a living I am a longtime Thinkpad afficionado. I do miss the lovely thinkpad trackpoint (so much better than a mouse pad) but the keyboard on teh Yoga is so good that I don't even miss the Thinkpad keyboard. My big fear for this computer is that it would better for multimedia than for real work. I've been pleasantly surprised by how I don't miss the old Thinkpad. Yes, Windows 8 interface is less business oriented, but soon the free Win 8.1 upgrade will fix that too.My one recommendation is that you buy this from the Microsoft Store. I'm so glad I did because of the way Microsoft fixes bloatware and partition problems before shipping their machines. One criticism you will find on the web is that Lenovo puts tons of useless and hidden partitions on this computer when they ship it with the result that much of the 128 GB hard drive space is unuseable. Most reviews say only about 64 gb is useable. Microsoft fixes that and it ships with only one partion that has 107 gb. The rest must be a hidden partition for recovery or something, which is totally acceptable. The other convenience is that Microsoft takes off all the bloatware like McAfee while leaving on great Lenovo software like the Motion Control that you can use for playing music or reading an ebook (only works with a few programs). Yes, you can delete all that stuff yourself but it's nice not to have to do so. Fixing the hard drive and the multiple and hidden partitions is a bigger positive and makes it well worth it to buy from the MS Store (I have no affiliation or even loyalty to MS, I just appreciate the way they improve OEM computers before shipping them out).", "Date": "September 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Only supports SATA2?", "Author": "E.

I tried using the ATTO benchark32 app and can only get speeds below 300MB/S, which is the SATA2 maximum. SATA3 is the newer standard and can go up to 600MB/s. I tried this on both drives (read below).- The keyboard is a bit flimsy. It's not really bad but definitely sub-par for a high end machine. If you're picky about keyboards it might be an annoyance for you.- The proprietary power adapter is expensive, if you want extras.- The tablet form factor is cumbersome and heavy. This is really more of a ultrabook with tablet-like qualities. Don't get it if you want a lightweight tablet-like device  with notebook-like power. There are other products that might come closer to achieving the latter description.- No VGA or Ethernet portsPros:- It's still lightening fast despite being SATA2. I'm not really sure if this matters when it comes to the user experience. I do advanced stuff like booting virtual machines in HyperV and they boot and run super fast.- It charges really fast. You can get to 80-85% in 30 minutes and get a full charge in an hour- Screen is very nice- Solid construction- The \"yoga\" hinge aspect is handy. I like having a good ultrabook that can be tablet-like (read con above)- Upgrading to 8GB RAM is easy (look for youtube videos)- It has a second MSATA slot so you can buy a $200 256GB MSATA drive for expansion and not have to replace the primary drive. It's a bit more challenging to install than RAM but not bad. I got it done in 15 minutes.

I can't tell that it is any better than my ASUS standard notebook that I have used for the past two years. I find it hard to believe the other reviews I have read that talk of six or even eight hours of usage, even with light duty. My main use is in surfing or in typing text documents, and seldom do anything with large or graphic files, but it is the exception for me to get more than three hours without having to plug-in.One of my first purchases after settling-in with the Yoga was an extra changer to make sure I had one in my carrying case as well as near my work desk.Other than that I couldn't be happier and highly recommend it for anyone --- unless battery life is a major concern.Update 9/10/2013 Changing to 3 stars from 4.

They sent me a RMA that required that I repackage the unit and then take it to a Federal Express office 50 miles away to have it shipped.

And I find this laptop works very well for my usage.I've read various reviews on the fan being too loud and coil whine which made me a little reluctant to purchase but luckily I had no issues with mine which was manufactured late January this year (2013). The fan I would say is a little louder than my older laptop but nothing as drastic as people saying they can hear it from meters and meters away. Mine sounds more like it's working harder/spinning faster than my older laptop it seems. I know Lenovo did provide a optional fix which can slow down the rpm and delay the fans at the expense of a warmer machine which I have not yet tried as the fan isn't bothering me too much.This laptop already had the partition issue that a lot of people were complaining about fixed and had roughly 100-105gb of desk space out of the 128gb SSD with 70-75gb free out of the box.This laptop is great for those who will mostly use their laptop in laptop mode but want the flexibility to use it in tablet mode when the need arises. In tablet mode, I find the keyboard at the back to be a little weird having owned an iPad and being use to the smooth back.

Great price for a touchscreen ultrabook. The i5 processor, 128GB SSD makes it speedy on most my Windows tasks and it boots almost instantly. The 4GB ram seems just fine. It runs AutoCAD, MathCAD and Photoshop just fine. Also, researching the unit it appears easy to open up to add larger RAM SODIMM, and a second mSATA SSD. This would allow upgrading to 8GB SODIMM of DDR3-1600, and with currently available mSATA drives two 250MB SSDs if needed.Screen size at 13.3\" is nearly 3\" larger than the MS Surface Pro, so easier to read the larger spreadsheets or drawings. Screen is very responsive to touch. The higher resolution than most budget touchscreen laptops makes the screen display crisp, and allows more content on the screen. When using the touchscreen with a non-touch specific program (MathCAD, AutoCAD, Word), on occasion, my fingers are too fat to select the item I need, and would perhaps be enhanced with a stylus as on the MS Surface Pro. However, in those cases, the large, sensitive touchpad (or an external mouse) works just fine.Though used mostly as a laptop with the keyboard, in the office I use it in tent-mode sitting next to my desktop dual 27\" monitors and controlled with keyboard/mouse sharing software. I can run IM, Twitter and a Weather app on it, not interrupting my workflow on the desktop.For travel the AC adapter is much smaller and lighter than any of my Dell laptops. The 3.5 lb weight and very thin profile makes it easy to carry and slip easily into my travel bag.  It is very nice when in a cramped coach seat on a flight where it is hard to have it open in laptop-mode that you can turn the screen around and use the Yoga in either tent-mode on the tray table, or as a tablet in your hands.A few negatives: The fan(s) become somewhat noisy when using CPU or graphic intensive applications. Also, the hinge is stiff when flipping the screen around, but that is likely needed so it will stand up in tent-mode. The keyboard works OK, but doesn't have the crisp touch of some of my other laptops. At about 4.5 hours of real use the battery life is much better than my old XPS 13 Dell laptop, but not comparable to a simple tablet like the iPad, but that's the price you pay for real computing horsepower versus just having \"apps\". The video output is HDMI, and works fine to plug into the TV at the hotel, but most LCD video projectors I use for speeches or customer presentations use VGA input cables, so I needed to buy a short $20 HDMI to VGA converter cable, that works fine, but is another item to add to my travel bag. It's heavier than the MS Surface Pro in tablet mode, but that's the price you pay to have a much larger screen, a second USB port, and the flexibility to actually upgrade it yourself.In summary, a great, relatively fast, and powerful touchscreen PC ultrabook, that can easily change modes depending on where you're using it.", "Date": "March 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Device..

Going into the purchase I was most concerned about the build quality around the hinge.

After extensive research and a number of hands-on tests, I settled on the Yoga.Overall, I'm really happy with the laptop.PROS- Touchscreen: I'm a fan of Windows 8 (calm down, trolls), and the touch-screen for the Yoga is high-res and very responsive. Highly readable, video and text are sharp and clear, and it's such a great relief to finally be able to just select items on-screen.- Noise: This machine is quiet. I haven't spent a lot of time with it in my lap, so I can't address any heat issues, but the fan is whisper-quiet.- Storage: Like others, I was concerned about having only 60-70 gigs available (on the 128gb unit), and was pricing storage upgrades. However, given how much I rely on SkyDrive and other cloud storage environments, this isn't a problem. I have MS Office 2013 installed with all components; SQL Server w/the management studio; and a handful of other apps, plus lots of documents, and still have plenty to spare.- Performance: Thanks in no small part to the SSD, this machine is very fast. Boot-to-login is about five seconds, with login-to-fully started about 30 seconds. Excel, Word, browser, video, music etc. all run very fast.- Keyboard: Very soft, with modest feedback and tactile responses. The key travel is less than average, and it's very quiet. Highly responsive, and I appreciate the dedicated arrows, Home/End/PgUp/PgDn keys. I had to change the BIOS to allow me to use the native function key actions, but that's a very quick fix.- Battery: This isn't really a PRO, but it isn't a CON either. I'm getting about six hours running the full assortment of apps; not great, not bad.- Connectivity: I had a few issues with the WiFi early on, as described by others here, but a few quick config changes made a big difference. The biggest was in the device power settings, preventing Windows from turning off the device to save power. All good after that.CONS- Trackpad: This is the one real annoyance. Pointing, scrolling, and the multi-touch (pinch/zoom/etc.) work great. The problem is with tap-to-click. The trackpad buttons are fine, and the trackpad itself is large and accessible with good placement, but the force required to tap-to-click is way too high. With sensitivity set to the highest, I still find myself having to tap two or three times.

Laptop, Tablet, Mini-HD TV? What's not to like. The current versions seem improved and do not have many of the issues which plagued the earlier ones, or at least mine does not. No Wifi issues, no trackpad issues, no disk partitioning mess. Just a very nice laptop/tablet with a good keyboard, a very good display, great performance and an excellent, innovative design.It's not perfect, no device is, but is a great, functional design, well executed and with solid build quality. If you can get it at a good price, I think you will be pleased with it.Here are my notes on the Yoga 13 i5 model based on my experience so far: A bit larger than I expected, but still reasonably portable and very slim. Great display, not the best ever, but very good. The resolution is perfect for this screen size, leaving text readable, and very good for photos, movies/videos, and graphics. Very bright. Good black levels for videos. Only small criticism is that the blacks do not have as much detail preserved as on the best displays I've used. But not anything awful, most will never notice. I only notice because I have used some truly great displays. Still, a very ncie display and I am quite content with it. Viewing angles are great. Colors are vivid. I think anyone will be very happy with it.Keyboard is quite decent. I am not having any issues. Like many, takes a little while to get used to, but overall feel and action is quite good, I think.  As many have noted, a shame there's no back-lighting, but the keys do have bright white on black lettering, so good visibility with even dim lighting. But a back-light would be nice. Guess the bonus is less drain on the battery.Battery life seems pretty good to me. I get 5-6 hours easily and with some \"management\" I can stretch this to 6-7 hours. Can get a full day's use if you are careful, put into sleep when not in use, and so on. Charger is very nice. A new design that is much, much better than almost any other laptop I have used, I really like it. Feel sure this will be the trend for future models. It's very much like a USB connector, but can be inserted either way. Good design.Windows 8 works very well and is very snappy. In fact, this is the best Win 8 experience I have had to date. The Yoga 13 seems to have been designed to make Windows 8 easier to use. I for one am getting used to it and don't feel the need for any add-ons. Have not updated to 8.1 yet (really, feel no need to do so) and still I'm fine. Everything works very well. The touch screen helps a lot, of course. And the great display. Very readable in tablet mode or laptop (desktop) mode. The touch has been flawless for me so far. Very sensitive and responsive. Also, the special function keys help a lot. That and knowing a few key shortcuts like Win+D for Desktop, Win+C for \"Charms\" and so forth. There are dedicated function keys fpr switching between apps easily, closing an app/window, and other common tasks.Performance is very good. Listing windows performance scores below. In daily use, everything is quick and snappy. Boots quickly, shutdown very quickly. Very nice. I really like the function keys being dedicated to things like Airplane mode on/off, Display On/off, volume mute and control, touchpad on/off. brightness up/down, and so on. There's even a dedicated \"Refresh\" key (F5). Nicely done.Windows 8 64-bit Experience Index scores:Processor -- 6.9  (Good. 1.8GHz i5 CPU))Memory RAM -- 5.9  (A bit slow, single channel RAM?)Desktop/Gaming Graphics -- 4.7/6.3  (Fair, Intel 4000 embedded Gfx)HDD -- 7.7 (Very good, decent SSD drive is nice to have)-- Overall, performance is very good in daily use.Trackpad works fine for me.  Actually a bit nicer than many I have used. It's large and supports gestures. The button \"areas\" work fine, as does single and two finger tapping. You can go into properties and turn off things like \"edge swipe\" if they cause you any problems.While watching videos, I switched to tablet mode without a hitch. Pretty cool. In general, I am very happy with the flexibility of the various modes possible with the Yoga 13. I use it primarily in laptop mode, occasionally tablet. But can see stand and tent modes being useful as well, sometimes.The fan does run pretty much constantly, but the fan noise is rather low and not troublesome to me. I only notice it when things are very quiet. They were smart to vent out the back and in use the Yoga 13 seems to stay fairly cool. Some warm spots near the upper left corner under heavy use, but nothing objectionable.All in all, I am enjoying the Yoga 13 very much and think it is a fine unit. It's very nicely designed, looks great, is very portable, has a great display, a fine keyboard, very good performance, and some nice bits like a full size HDMI port. It is available at good prices now, so a real win if you get it much cheaper than the original selling prices. Still fairly new tech and no serious issue of any kind that I have seen.It's an easy 5 stars for me.

I'm not an IT person, so I won't pretend to talk about speeds or connectivity issues. Add to that I live in a rural area and, though my internet is really very fast, it still depends on a clear line of sight to its tower and can be interfered with by weather and nature. I bought my Yoga 13 in July 2013.I love being able to use the touch screen and keyboard/touchpad interchangeably. My laptop boots in just about 8 seconds and I haven't yet had any problems unlocking the screen. There is no option to not have a password required. You can set whatever profile and lock screen picture you like, but you can't use personal pictures for the background of the Metro (home screen). Microsoft has some neat photos, but there's still only 15 or 20. Also, there are just stock colors to choose from for your theme. There are programs out there that you can get to be able to edit the Metro background but, for some reason, MS has decided to limit what we can do out of the box in this regard. Actually, most of the faults or limitations I've experienced have been due to Windows 8. And, honestly, I really like Windows 8 (please don't discount the rest of the review because of that!). I'm used to the functionality of touch screen phones and kindles, so Windows 8 isn't really that different. What I don't like about it is that it seems to be incomplete and totally useless to anyone not using a touch screen device. None of the applications through the Metro have the same options as their original counterparts. For instance, you can't access internet options when using the application from the Metro, such as blocking sites. Most in-depth programs must be run from Desktop mode. My fianc\u00e9 got a new desktop pc, equipped with Windows 8, and it will not run many games that are anything more than simple games that don't require heavy computing. He ended up getting Windows 7 on his pc. Also, without being able to utilize a touch screen, Windows 8 just really isn't that impressive. At least, that's our impression. Having said all that, all programs start promptly every time. I prefer to use internet shortcuts on the Metro to the MS apps just because the UI and functionality are, in my mind, better.My Yoga 13 does get quite warm whenever playing a game or a movie. Any laptop I've had previously has gotten hot too, so I wasn't really concerned. But that may be a mistake on my part. Time will tell. I use a cooling pad to try to combat the heat when I do these activities and it seems to work well. Occasionally, I've had to restart my laptop to get it to recognize my wifi. Which is annoying, but it's only happened 2 or 3 times since I bought it so, again, not really concerned. I read reviews that complained of the keys getting stuck. Hasn't happened to me yet, but I haven't owned it that long. I use a keyboard skin, which sometimes messes with the keys but I also don't write papers or take typing tests with the Yoga. I wish there were more options with the touchpad than just on/off. It is, to me, very sensitive and I inadvertently double tap pretty often. I let my niece and 2 nephews (16, 14, 2 yrs) watch shows on it for several hours and it managed to survive, so I'm impressed with the durability so far.I've read that Lenovo's customer service is hopeless, so I got the year warranty from Best Buy when I bought my Yoga (best price at the time). Maybe I should have gone for 2 years, but it was pricey at around $300.Will update with any other issues as they arise.Update - 12/14/13: Still loving it. There are some annoying things: the keyboard doesn't stick, per se, but it is sensitive and will often type an extra letter or two. Also, and I don't know if this is Windows or Lenovo, it tells you you're not connected to the internet pretty often. I don't ever have to restart it to get it to connect; must have been a pre-update thing. But occasionally, I will disconnect and reconnect. Or close and open Explorer again. I'm anxiously awaiting an internet browser other than Explorer that opens through the Metro (every other browser opens in desktop). Considering that Windows 8 isn't doing all that well, not sure that will happen.

My wife (with a slew of chronic medical conditions including muscle weakness and chronic fatigue) needed a new laptop and we knew early on that it would have to be an Ultrabook. After much reserch we decided on the yoga because of the reviews.We went to a brick and mortar store to test out the weight. This thing is light. It weighs less than the average textbook and is thinner than a one subject notebook. The touchscreen is great if you don't like trackpads and let's face it, windows 8 isn't really optimized for them or a mouse. The added features work as advertised.Performance - My wife works in technical communications and this will have no problem running Adobe creative suite and pandora. She does a lot of work from home (her health) the only downside is the small HD. We have an external drive so that's not a big problem at all.Bottom line - If you need a light laptop that will work well with windows 8 I would defiantly recommend it for someone. If you need something for games look somewhere else. It's light, thin, and great for taking notes and photo editing but if you're serious you will need an external hard drive.Bonus - Amazon is much cheaper than Lenovo and their shipping and customer service is much faster!", "Date": "August 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great idea bad execution", "Author": "still healing", "ReviewID": "R3VV0NYEEW0S8O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this computer 4 months ago and have had frequent issues like over heating, touchy touch pad and screen freezing.

Asked to either have someone sent to the house to repair it, ship me a new computer, or refund my money.  Was put on hold so the guy could talk to his team leader.  After 15 min was sent back to the switchboard, transferred back and disconnected.  Called again, new rep was rude, could not find original info, and when asked for his name, hung up on me.  Called again, and finally got a team leader to call me back.  Said he could ask for  a one time exception to have someone come to the house, but it would have to be approved, and probably wouldn\u2019t be.

William Rodgers", "ReviewID": "RYDLZEVH9YYMI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been wanting a convertible for some time and as a computer professional, I know Lenovo is a well-respected technology company that got their start making Thinkpads for IBM many years ago. When I saw this Yoga 13 for sale at a good price, even though it was a refurb, I decided to take the plunge.I have had several refurbs in the past but those have always been from the D*** Outlet and never once had an issue. Naively, I assumed that this was a Lenovo factory refurb and that was my mistake. A third party to the selling vendor did the refurb and it definitely was not up to Lenovo factory standards.The look and feel of the Yoga 13 was outstanding, thin and lightweight. It promptly booted up thanks to an Intel i5 CPU and a 128 GB SSD. When Windows prompted me to \"Activate\", it would not accept the Product Key because it was not valid. Looking further into the software, none of the Lenovo software was installed or present indicating to me that this was a generic Window 8 reimaging of the laptop and was not specifically designed for the Lenovo Yoga 13. Further, the reimaging did not use a proper configuration of Windows 8 which would have included a unique Product Key but rather they used one Product Key for many different laptops and Microsoft probably recognized the first laptop that activated but after that, they began denying anyone else who tried to activate. Basically, it was a software piracy issue and I do not blame Microsoft for protecting their brand.Also, I could not simply change the Product Key as is the usual case with most Windows installations. Something about the reimaging process did not allow this procedure.I did work with the vendor's tech support people and they offered to refund my money and were very courteous but would not just send me a valid license for Win 8. Since I really like this ultrabook, I decided to keep the product but that would mean I have to purchase a new copy of Win 8 in order to use this computer for longer than 30 days.Evidently, good karma came my way because another person from the vendor's customer satisfaction department called quickly credited my credit card for the cost of a new license for Windows 8. May faith in Internet shopping is restored.Once I reinstalled Windows 8, installed the appropriate Yoga 13 drivers which I downloaded from their website, I was in business.This is a solid well built ultrabook that has a touchscreen that can be used in regular laptop mode, folded back and setup as a movie screen or folded back all the way so that it can be used as a tablet. Very cool.I plan on upgrading the RAM from 4 to at least 8 gb and I may eventually upgrade the SSD from 128 GB to 256 GB. The Lenovo Yoga 13 Users Manual (get it from the Lenovo website) has detailed instructions on how to do this and there are videos on YouTube on how to do this as well.I plan to use this as my training device to help me learn Windows 8 which I really do no like but realize that I have to eventually come to accept the inevitable.Another well-built Lenovo product.", "Date": "May 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent laptop", "Author": "Nagoal", "ReviewID": "R2PXNS16BAHBV7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Exactly what I was looking for: light, versatile, great size of the screen, and it feels like a real computer, not a toy.", "Date": "May 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Decent laptop but INCONSISTENT performance", "Author": "Joe Rhodes \"JR\"", "ReviewID": "R1VTXWRGKHPNE7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a decent laptop but it definitely did not meet my expectations unfortunately especially considering cost.I have had this laptop for almost a year now and I will say it has been fast and reliable for my purposes; basic everyday use including internet browsing, microsoft office, Netflix/Youtube. It has worked decently and never really had me to the point of ripping out my hair.The problem I have with the laptop are its \"Yoga\" features.  These features that you pay a hefty price for are not as reliable as basic use like you would a regular laptop.  First of all, the touch screen is hopeless.  For some reason there are times where it works fine mostly with just minor annoyances of hitting the wrong buttons, but other days it doesn't even function.  For example a screen will pop up saying \"blah, blah, blah\" then an \"Okay\" button.  No matter how many times you hit the button, it won't work.  This is especially irritating when you have the laptop in tablet mode where there's only touchscreen available.  In this case you need to open it back up an use the navigation pad.  For this reason, I never use tablet mode anymore.  Its pretty heavy as a tablet anyway.Another serious flaw is the drop in performance when the screen flips, especially upside down.  When the laptop is in tent mode for example, everything especially the touch screen slows down and loses functionality.  Watching Youtube or Netflix in tent mode can sometimes be problematic because of that.One other thing I don't really like is that it doesn't have an ethernet cable port.  This however was not a big problem for me since I was able to buy a USB converter for ethernet.  I just think for $900 (what I payed at the time) they should include it with the package.In conclusion this Lenovo laptop is just alright.  It is a little bit ahead of itself in the featured technology, but what can I say it works and is reliable for everything I need to do with it.  I never had to get it repaired which I am thankful for but I spent enough that I shouldn't.I don't recommend this laptop because I wouldn't have bought it again if I could go back even with the couple hundred dollars dropped.

Stay away!", "Author": "Bryan Li", "ReviewID": "R2Z457HBYCW6KH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "***Update 4/23/2013****Changing my review from a 1-star to a 4-star.  I can't give it five-stars due to the initial hassle I went through the first month of dealing with customer support.I forgot to update this, but I did in fact receive a new machine from Lenovo a couple weeks ago.  It was brand new and definitely better!  It took a lot of work, and also required me to talk to the right people.  It wasn't as simple as calling into the support lines and complaining, however I had a very valid case after dealing with really bad customer support for more than a month.In the end, Lenovo did the right thing and I am satisfied once again!***Update 3/22/2013****After a month of working with customer support, my call was finally heard. A new customer relations agent had contacted me directly this morning and has agreed to replace my laptop! It took the effort of my part to make sure I contacted the right people. I haven't received my machine yet, but with the response I received this morning, I'm very happy with this, since he understands the experience I went through with customer support. I'm told it will be an even better machine, so I am very excited and happy to hear this.I'll write any updates once I receive my new machine. Lenovo... you're finally doing things right!************************Original Review:I usually  NEVER write reviews for products I buy online, but I am writing this review because i feel it is COMPLETELY necessary to let buyers be aware of the HORRENDOUS customer support provided by Lenovo.  The bulk of this review is mainly towards Lenovo Customer Support, or lack there of.  This is for the Lenovo Yoga 13, with 128 GB SSD drive.After using the Lenovo Yoga 13 for a little over a month, I had nothing but good things to say about it.  And in terms of computer performance, would agree with most 5-star reviews of this machine in terms of functionality for the price.  But I'm giving this a 1-star due to the terrible customer support on Lenovo's side.  I would give a 0 stars to this if I could!Here's my LENGTHY experience with Lenovo customer support:After about 36 days of use, light internet web-surfing, downloading music here and there, with the occasional apps, I noticed that I got a warning that my hard drive space was reaching it's limit.  Very confused, I opened up My Computer to realize that there was only 34 GB of hard drive space, and it was completely full!  After a month of use, and being completely oblivious when checking my hard-drive disk space (yes, this is my fault), I was shocked to only see 34 GB for my C drive.  Quickly, I googled \"Lenovo Yoga 13 hard drive\", and came across many articles that describe Lenovo's messy disk layout, which partitions the hard drives into 4 drives, also leaving alot of the hard-drive space \"missing\".  Here's an example article:[...]After reading about this, I decided to call Warranty Support through Lenovo.  I was 6 days too late to return my machine to Best buy (30 day return-policy), so I felt this was my only option.  There is a \"hotfix\" online through Lenovo's support website which claims to fix the disk layout issue, combining 4 of the hard-drives into one, and freeing up much of the space on the computer.  Hotfix is found here:[...] The problem is that when I worked with a warranty support agent to run the hotfix, it never worked!  It crashed halfway through it.  When we tried re-running the hot-fix, it gave us an error, saying that the partition has been modified, and the hotfix was unable to continue.  After a failed attempt at running the hotfix,  my Yoga has 3 hard drives.  C: with 34 GB, D: with 24 GB, and E with 20GB.  This totals to 78 GB of total hard drive space.  Where did the other 50 GB go??  To make things worse, the hotfix completely screwed up the One-Key Recovery (OKR) system that Lenovo has on their machines to allow the user to reformat the machine to default settings, or back to a known good checkpoint.  So at this point, reformatting the laptop was not an option for me!Lenovo customer support is TERRIBLE.  Not only do you they keep pushing you in circles between departments, I've spent nearly a month contacting them and I still do not have my issue fixed!  It's been almost a month since I made my first call into the support line, along with multiple calls to different departments (warranty support, software premium support, customer relations).  At this point Lenovo has done a TERRIBLE job of helping me resolve this issue in a timely manner.  This includes not following through with commitments to call me back (from all three departments!), as well as sending in my computer and having nothing to show for it!My timeline looks a little something like this(Each phone call takes anywhere from 1-3 hours on the phone with the Agent)2/26/2013 - Makes initial call to Warranty Support.  Spend 4 hours on phone call with Warranty Support agent to get issue resolved.  No resolution.  Warranty Support agent tells me a Software support expert will call me tomorrow to help resolve my issue.2/27/2013 - (Waits until late into the day) Makes call to Software support expert, since I received no calls throughout the day.  Software expert tells me that it's a premium service and transfers me back to Warranty support.2/27/2013 - Gets dropped from transfer, has to dial back into Warranty support.  Warranty support agent looks up my notes and explains to me that Software experts should be able to help me because their \"Supervisor\" has signed off the case for a Software expert to look into it.  Gets transferred back to Software premium support.2/27/2013 - Software premium support once again tells me they can do nothing for me unless I pay for the premium support, even though I mention a Supervisor has signed off on this case.  Get transferred back to Warranty.2/27/2013 - Warranty support finally agrees to have my Lenovo Yoga 13 machine sent into factory, to try to fix the issue.  If it could not be fixed, it shall be restored back to default settings (they even asked me to backup my files just in case they needed to do this!)2/28/2013 - Goes to Fedex to drop off my laptop to get it shipped to factory.***Waits almost a week.***3/6/2013 - Need to get off work early to sign off for my package.  Receive package at the house.  Nothing was done to my machine to fix it.  Was sent back because there was no \"defects\", even though there was an inventory control sheet included in the package which described the issue, and what was to be done.3/6/2013 - Calls back into Warranty support, let them know that I received my package but nothing was done.  Warranty asks me to ship it in AGAIN.  I do not want to do this, because they made a mistake the first time, and I did not want to go another week without using my laptop.  Warranty informs me I can speak to customer relations about this.  I am promised they will call within 3 business days.3/11/2013 - Received no call from Customer relations.  Since they have no direct number, need to call warranty support again to make a second request for customer relations to call me back.  Wait another 1-3 business days.3/13/2013 - Finally received a call from Customer relations.  Customer Relations agent inform me that we can try to set something up with a software support agent by Monday, since I was not available Friday.  They send me an e-mail immediately that they forgot that there's a timezone differences (I am on PST, they are on EST), so Monday afternoon may not work.  I respond to that e-mail immediately and let them know Monday morning should be fine.  Customer relations agent also mention that a follow-up will be in place in case that software agent does not call.3/14/2013 - Sent another follow-up email to customer relations see if we were still on for Monday morning.  No response3/18/2013 - Sent another e-mail to customer relations letting them know I did not receive a call from the software agent or customer relations.  No response from either party.  Also left a voicemail.3/19/2013 - Sent another e-mail and left a voicemail to customer relations in hopes to get a call back.  No response.3/20/2013 - Had to call into warranty support AGAIN (are you kidding me?!?, how many times already!?!?)  Explained the situation, AGAIN, and was finally promised that I'd be called back.3/21/2013 - Customer relations finally responds via e-mail.  They give me the option to send in my machine ONCE again.  This is something I want to avoid, due to the fact they screwed up the first time.  Not only do I have to go a week without using my  machine, but I literally have to go home early from work to sign off the package.  By doing this AGAIN, I'm wasting my time AND money.  At this point I want my machine replaced, but they are unwilling to do so.So you can imagine how discouraging it is to call this many times, as well as e-mail, and still not have any real action items done to get my issue resolved.  It's been almost a month!  It's a combination of the time this is taking, along with the feeling of being pushed around which is very displeasing.  I was expecting much more simple customer support from such a big company.I still have my  machine, and the issue still persists.

Note that most of us use one notebook, and another one at school or at work.  If you want to change the keyboard layout, think how it will affect people when they are home or when they are work, or when they are home on the notebook vs on the desktop.2) The right mouse button area on the trackpad is too large.  Many time I meant to click the left button and got the right button instead.  The right mouse button could be just the 1/4 of the region, instead of 1/2.3) The \"Edge swipe\" on the trackpad, which changes the Desktop to the Win 8 Metro view... there are probably a hundred times I got switched to the Metro when I didn't mean to, until I turned the \"edge swipe\" off.", "Date": "March 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Really poor Wifi", "Author": "W.

I didn't want to always be using the work laptop, and I wanted something smallish I could throw in a smaller bag to cart along with me. That said, I've configured it to do all things I do for work -- ssh tunneling with PuTTY, Git, etc. so it's really handy for a secondary work machine if I'm away.In a pinch, I've tethered to my Galaxy Note 3, and that was very easy to do, with pretty good results for having to ssh into a command line on an Ubuntu server.Things I'm not in love with... mine does not have a lighted keyboard. Wah. I don't know how often I've ever found myself needing to type in the dark, so this is a minor gripe. The battery could be better. Really don't expect to get more than four hours of solid work done on this machine without plugging it in. The keyboard can be a bit springy, but this can be fixed. The touch pad isn't nearly as nice as the one on my retina macbook, but this isn't a deal breaker for me.Things that are fabulous... It's very easy to upgrade the RAM to 8GB. It's nearly as easy to add a SECOND HARD DRIVE! I just threw a 480 GB hard drive in mine, and now I have an i5 ultrabook with 8GB of RAM and some 600 GB of hard drive space. Once you open it up to make these upgrades, just throw some small bits of carpet tape under the keyboard and the keyboard is nice and tight with good feedback. To counter the little-bit-wonky touch pad, I snagged a Logitech ultra-thin mouse. This highlights the fact that this machine has bluetooth built in. Works great. This machine definitely rivals any other (full-sized) laptop I've ever had.I don't use it as a tablet, but it's great to think I could.

I am aware that this area is reserved for Yoga 13 reviews, but I must voice my opinion on my 11s and about Lenovo in general.The computer itself works great, I love my computer. It's a well put together machine. The only complaints about the machine that I have are that it is slow and laggy (which could be windows 8), and that the flip from tablet mode to notebook mode is not always smooth. These things are minor as this computer is superior to any other tablet pc.Now, the bad stuff: Lenovo as a company does not care for their customers. To those who do not care about the computer's company, disregard my one star review. The computer on its own is fantastic. But, if something goes wrong, Lenovo cannot fix it (event with purchased extended warranty). Here's why: I looked at my computer a few days ago and realized that screws were missing from the bottom. These screws can only be put into a Lenovo product via a machine and do not have room for a phillips head or a flat head. So...I called Lenovo and waited for 10 minutes on the phone. I was disconnected. I called back and talked to Katherine who barely spoke English and informed me that the only way for this computer to be fixed would be to send it out to Texas to have it fixed for a week. Well, I'm going to Europe in a week, how am I supposed to know if the laptop will get in on time?Note: I've been a huge supporter of Apple up until September 2013. I figured it was time to move to the PC world as I am a coder and designer for websites. When I used to call Apple, they would send a replacement PC or iPod or iPad free of charge as long as I shipped back my defective product on time and the product met their specifications.Lenovo doesn't accept this as a viable option. After talking to Katherine, she said the best they could do would be to send me screws. These screws cannot be put in by a human without specific tools. I waited on the line for 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes and finally I get in touch with a manager. She informs me of the same thing: I can only get the screws sent to me. There is no other option. There is no way to make me happy. I must conform to Lenovo's standards of fixing a customer's concern.Needless to say, I will be posting about Lenovo and their despicable customer service for all to know. I have not decided what I am going to do yet, I believe my next step will be to call Apple and see if I can grab a MacBook Air and trade in this PC using their Trade-In Program.

My work computer has always been a Windows machine, but my home computer has been a Macbook for the past 6 or so years, though before that I had a Dell.  I've never had any trouble switching between the two.So, when I finally decided to replace my ancient white Macbook, I thought I might give Windows a try. You get so much bang for your buck in terms of hardware, Apple is a terrible company with no philanthropy, and I was drawn to Windows 8 for its style.  I did a lot of research and determined that the Lenovo Yoga 13 was the best option, so I killed it.Almost as soon as I got it, I started keeping track of how long I had left to return it. I found Windows, at least on this machine, to be glitchy and occasionally inexcusably slow. Chrome would occasionally shut down for no reason, Netflix and Hulu were choppy, even with no other programs open, and I became a little befuddled with the Metro feature of Windows 8, although that probably would just take a couple months of getting used to.  In general, I found this computer to be distressingly like my six-year-old Macbook. Windows 8 has potential, but in the end it wasn't enough to draw me away from OS X.As for the hardware, it's an excellent machine.  The style is beautiful, it's sleek and thin, and the inversion-tablet feature is pretty cool. I found it difficult to type on because I was used to a different kind of keyboard, but I'm sure I could have gotten used to it.  I did not like the trackpad.  It was slightly under-responsive, and it lacked much of the multi-touch features that Macbooks now have. I was able to make it work (e.g. set up hot corners for web navigation), but it didn't make me happy. I never had any Wifi issues.I found a great deal on an Apple certified refurbished Macbook Air for $900 ($100 or so less than I paid for this computer), so I jumped on it and sent the Yoga back to Amazon.The Air, of course, works like a dream.", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad Design Flaws, very bad, don't buy", "Author": "Manimal", "ReviewID": "R6IOP9SIA4Y6O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I did not buy this Lenovo G580 computer from Amazon, but I'd like everyone to see this before they buy one.I bought this laptop from local Fry's store, picked it up mainly because of the price. It seemed offered good value. But after one year of usage, I know I was wrong. Here is why.1. It is made of cheap parts. Well, it is cheap, but still works, right?2. It is heavy and ugly, my boy complained all the time.3. It has a bad design flaw. After half a year light usage, the hinge part pops open, it turns out it uses the same tiny screws as the bottom cover, it is not strong enough.4. At 11 months, blue smoke came out of the vent, it is totally toasted5. Their repair service is really really bad. Did not hear anything from them after 3 weeks sending Lenovo the computer for repair, finally called them, find myself talking to someone in India who does not know anything. 2 days later, got a notice they shipped the computer6. The battery shipped back can run only half hour now, not the original battery anymore.7. 2 days later, the AC power adapter retreated into the case, cannot use it anymore.8. Talk to them again, they said it is out of warranty.9. Complained to BBB, but Lenovo refused to replace itSo after one year, this computer is complete dead.  My 2005 Sony Vaio is still working. If I had spent $100 more, I could have picked up a much better computer and still be using it happily.Conclusion:  DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER, DO NOT BUY ANY LENOVO COMPUTERYou will regret if you do.", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Waited Forever", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RCPVAQWA45UXU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I gave this product all 1's because I never even got to have it. I ordered my Yoga a month ago. There were billing issues (on Lenovo's side) and then last week I was called to be told that they were no longer carrying the parts for my order and would I like this instead? I actually ended up upgrading with the promise that my laptop would ship today (2/11/13 - almost 1 month exactly from my initial order). When I went to check my order status though, it said estimated ship date 5/20/13! Why, after waiting a month would I want to wait 3 MORE MONTHS to get my highly anticipated product?!?! By that time, they probably would have ran out of other parts and I most certainly wouldn't have been getting the shiny new innovative product I had been looking forward to. Anyone who loves computers knows the newest thing is out of date almost instantly.So I cancelled my order. Guess what? I had been given some \"freebies\" to placate me when they had to change my order the first time. They're no longer \"free\". They shipped before my laptop (obviously) and now I need to return them or be charged the full amount for things I didn't even want, order or ask for in the first place.The worst part is, I'm just so dissapointed. I heard great things about Lenovo. They're products and customer service and I received neither.So if you're thinking about getting a Yoga, and you don't want to wait 1-4 months for your product, don't do it. Go some other route. There's other, really sleek, convertible laptops out there. Asus, Sony or Dell. Companies that won't jerk you around saying you'll get your laptop next week... oh wait, nope, 3 months from now!And, of yeah, Lenovo, I'm going to post this review anywhere I can.", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00ATANVLG"}}
