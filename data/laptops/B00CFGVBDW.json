At first I hated it and was going to get an external mouse but after some use of a few weeks I think I have gotten use to it more. It was too touchy for me and I was worried of clicking where I didn't want to click at first. The computer is fast with a large hard drive, 1TB and seems way too large for what I need one for but can you ever have too big a hard drive? The startup is fast and windows 8 has been good but takes some getting used to as does the computer. It is built good and the key action and touch is nice for me. The colors are bright and there are enough helps with Vaio and Sony that you should not get too lost even if your not a geek. I had an Acer before the Sony and the Sony makes the Acer seem like a brick compared to it. Fit and finish on the Sony are first rate and its seems tough enough for most uses , even students should do fine with it. The sound compared to my Acer is A+ with good lows and not too much distortion in my opinion. I have never had a Sony but I like this first one very much. I don't think for the average user such as a student , home user , or even small business  will be disappointed. The Sony Vaio seems to run cool and is just barely warm after a few hours of use thanks to the placement of Sony's cooling fan on the left side. If you like music production, it comes with some good Sony music software like Acid and Sound forge. I wish they would equip it with a decent word processor that you don't have to pay big money for. Bloat ware is there but then just uninstall what you don't want so no big deal. It comes with Kaspersky virus but I had my own from another that I liked much better so that one got uninstalled. I think the average user will be happy with this laptop and although its not a gamer you can still have fun with the occasional game and not suffer too much. Web surfing is fast and pages boot up fast. I believe the top of this laptop is aluminum but the bottom is still plastic which seems tough enough for me. I hope this helps those average buyers like me who want to step up and try Sony , I don't think you will be disappointed by this new Sony Vaio.", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love my Sony!", "Author": "C. Keeney", "ReviewID": "R6K0A2C20PIN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop was soooo easy to setup...You put in battery and then plug it in and it starts right up.  Learning my way around Windows 8 was a bit frustrating but otherwise we all love this laptop.  My teenage daughter uses this to play Neverwinter and Jade Dynasty and she also plays IMVU.  She multitasks it to death and it does fine, including Skype.  The keys are a joy to type on.  And as with every Sony, it's a beautiful laptop.The touchscreen is also beautiful and extremely responsive.  Windows 8 looks awesome on it and really once you get some practice is fun to use.The one thing that I dislike about this laptop is in relation to the touch screen.  When you touch the screen, the screen moves backward slightly when touched and that drives me bananas.  I also have this mobile pc from Sony:  https://www.amazon.com/gp/vine/product?ie=UTF8&asin;=B00CIITRKQ and since it's not hinged it doesn't move backward when touched and I like it much better.  My daughter doesn't let it bother her but when gaming she still uses a mouse.I would never have another brand of laptop, I just love Sony!", "Date": "September 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love the computer but not the operating system", "Author": "B.

Unfortunately, it is quite heavy but I do like the built in DVD drive and that's the necessary trade-off.Although I've worked with computers for 30 years, I am confused by Windows 8.

Sony has always been a reliable company in my experience so I was interested to see how I would like their computer-related offerings.  I received this laptop, put the battery in, plugged it in and \"away I went\"!!!The first thing that was BLINDINGLY obvious and such a plus was the SUPER FAST connectivity and \"booting up\".  The FULL HD 1080p display is beautiful! I was already familiar with Windows 8 so this laptop really has a fluid movement for me.  I did have to update with the Sony VAIO updater to allow the touchscreen to work but after a couple of minutes of downloading the update, the touchscreen works perfectly.  The touchpad is something to get used to, however...  It works great as long as you know all the multi-gestures. For younger people (I am 43) the touchpad would more than likely be a HUGE PLUS! I use a plug and play wireless mouse because I am \"old school\". I am a MUSIC PERSON/classical singer and I just HAD to install my Altec Lansing BX1220 speakers, because I rehearse with my laptop almost daily.  I really needed the extra sound as I thought the ClearAudio Sound was a bit \"tinny\". However, I can't imagine that most people would need extra speaker sound.The software, for the most part is WONDERFUL!  I love the Sony Imagination Studio! Especially the music software!  I miss Microsoft Works/Microsoft Outlook for e-mail though, but with a little research there are so many other FREE alternatives out there to download that I am liking the change.  I use OPERA MAIL to link all of my e-mail accounts together, Firefox for my browser and AVG/Spybot/Spyware Blaster as opposed to the free trials that are installed on this laptop at the factory.Overall, I have no complaints about this laptop.  The screen resolution is great, the laptop is portable and light, the battery DOES INDEED work for 4 hours, the backlit keyboard is AWESOME!  All in all, a great SONY laptop at a very reasonable price!", "Date": "September 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "My son loves it", "Author": "Crystal Battis", "ReviewID": "R2E671CPECCBVI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is a great lap top....touch screen is perfect.
