Programs were loaded and files transferred without a hitch.  For $750, a machine this fast is a deal that is hard to beat.  I have used several other computer brands, but I have to say that this is my second Acer, and I have been consistently pleased with Acer products.  With products like this, Acer could seize the lead in the laptop market place.", "Date": "March 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very fast laptop, works great with Gentoo Linux", "Author": "Blake", "ReviewID": "R6U9GQ7VVA6Y9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This machine has a monster CPU, much faster than laptops costing twice as much. All peripherals work well with Linux, and because of  the fast CPU, Gentoo was all compiled and ready to run in just a matter of hours.  Battery life is great, about 4 hours of actual working time.  Plenty of RAM and a huge 1TB hard drive add to the value.  It may not have a lot of extras and gadgets, but that's not what I want in a work computer, just speed.  It would be faster with an SSD, but with the spinning drive it's still plenty fast.  Had the machine a month and it's been great.", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Appears to be a good machine but can't tell due to lack of parts support", "Author": "PokeyMan", "ReviewID": "R3TK1KUK98Y6JM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Overall I believe this a good machine.  There is a problem that is keeping me from making the recovery disks.  For over 3 weeks Acer has been unable to have the disks made because the software for this machine is so new.  In other words, this machine was put on the market in mid January 2014 and the recovery disks are still not available.  The bad part is that neither customer service nor the parts department are able to tell me why it is taking so long to get the disks.  It appears that they can't talk with engineering to see if there is a technical issue that is trying to be resolved.  Not a good way to start a relationship with a company I haven't done business with before.  At this point I can't recommend this machine to anyone.", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Returned a Dell for this One.  No \"Brushed Aluminum\" (Thank You).", "Author": "Charles Knowland", "ReviewID": "R1ESTZDXGE9FLQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This will sound strange to a lot of people, but I bought a Dell and returned it in favor of this one due mainly to one factor; the smooth plastic surface of all things.  The Dell I bought, as with SO many others in its class, has this \"brushed aluminum\" surface that they neglected to advertise.  I do not want my hand resting against an aluminum alloy for 8 to 12 hours a day.  I am shocked the computer companies would not be conscious of people having health concerns about constant aluminum exposure of any kind.  Only a percentage of people will care, but it's a significant concern among enough people that I'm shocked the manufacturers are using the material.So, I have the smooth plastic surface.  Of course there are concerns with plastic, but not like those of aluminum.  People think the plastic is \"cheap\" in comparison, but I am plenty happy with it.  It is a smooth clean surface that is easy to maintain.Outside of that, this is my second Acer and I am very happy with it thus far.  Great performance.  A bonus to have no windows 8 to learn...I just started it up and BANG, off I went with anything I needed to do.  My previous Acer had a minor issue with getting the screen saver to work, but it works all the time now anyway, lol, so whatever was going on resolved itself on its own.  Outside of that, only one other minor issue with a tiny on-and-off again noise in the fan, but it's rare.  Acer's seem to be the cheaper computers by most people's perceptions, but they've been good to me, and their site enables you to actually call and speak to a live person, with a phone number readily available.  I've never had need to call them except to have them help me find the model I wanted to buy, but it's nice to see a computer company that has a strong presence online and makes themselves available should I have any issue at all.  Toshiba, for example, considered an amazing computer company, I couldn't find a dang phone number ANYWHERE on their site just to talk to someone about their features.  One gives up searching for a phone number that should be cake to find under a \"contact\" link/tab after five minutes wasted.Anyway!...Happy so far, and I expect to be for years to come, just as I am with my old Acer of three years.  \"Thank you\" Acer for using this \"cheap plastic\" hand rest/surface....some of us out here actually far PREFER this surface over the metal ones, and will base our buying decisions on it.  It's that important to some of us!And \"thank you\" Amazon for working with me on this issue and allowing the return of the Dell after expressing my concern upon opening the product.  I'm very happy with the new Acer.", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Has what I need", "Author": "nighthawk", "ReviewID": "R3UP28C32DL554", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Acer serves my needs well:  start up fast, not to heavy for traveling with, big screen for watching movie, with clear pictures.

This new 15.6 keyboard is lovely and large and I find the computer is oh so fast.  But, the keyboard has a mind of its own.  I have checked keyboard shortcuts and other possible reasons for its actions.  I am typing and then I am at the beginning of the sentence or the page and typing over what I was typing.  In emails, this is manifested by my message suddenly being typed in the middle of the subject line, after I am almost finished.  No rhyme or reason, but major annoying.  So, I am looking for solutions.The speed of the connection with the internet and other operations are lovely, but if the keyboard is a problem, it is a huge problem.
