The built-in speakers sound very muddled and do not get loud enough.- Keyboard could be better. It feels good on your hands, but I find that I often miss characters while typing because I did not type hard enough on the keys. That can be annoying, but I am getting used to it. I'm hoping that this will improve with use as the keys limber up or my finger adjust.- Screen resolution could be higher, but it is what I expected for the price.", "Date": "April 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "It is a workhorse", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1CRAU88BXZ62L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this one to replace my Lenovo x200 which lasted for 5 years.The screen is huge and rectangular if you like that sort of thing. It is extremely clear and easy to work with. The laptop is heavy, not really something you can place in your lap. The keyboard is nice and simple with the Numerical keypad on the right, very intuitive to work with. The speed is fast with Intel i3 and is great for surfing the net and doing simple stuff. You could go for the i5 which is one step up or the super power i7 but for me the i3 is good as I do simple business stuff and a lot of web surfing. This will be a good computer for someone in school/grad school to handle most of the tasks. However if you are a programmer doing data intensive work, go higher with the chip. This seems to be a very durable laptop, you can lug it around as I do and I dont treat it very gently. The keys are delicate though so be careful however you will find this to be much stronger than the Lenovos. Hate the operating system Win 8, had it removed and loaded Win 7. This will be difficult to do if you are not an intermediate level computer user so would not recommend it.All in all, I like it. it is fast, clean and powerful. The screen is very nice to work in and it handles all tasks well.", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love It", "Author": "Tom Pasqua", "ReviewID": "R3B97DYKNJIVGD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Since I graduated from a 10 year old HP desktop running XP, anything would have been an upgrade. But this unit is really quick. The I3 processor and 6GB of RAM make for a great snappy laptop. I read other reviews and the only major complaint was the sound quality and I agree. It could be better. I knew that going in but it wasn't important for my purposes. Would definitely recommend this unit to others.", "Date": "May 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good laptop for the money", "Author": "Rita Clegg", "ReviewID": "R32ZLTGHN56AG6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop has been all that it is advertised for.  Although I'm not a fan of Windows 8, this has 8.1 and has proven very well.  It is fast, easy to use, nice have a 10-key number pad on it.  Graphics are very clear.", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "I am new to Windows 8", "Author": "cheryl ward", "ReviewID": "R2NE14XQ415JOH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great operating system I am loving my Laptop, so easy to operate,  I purchase two one for my husband, he learns something new every day.  I was a XP, Vista and Windows 7 user and I thought it was time for an upgrade.  So much better to use that Windows 7 and I love the tiles.  I would recommend  to both my family and friends, thanks", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00II5DE0M"}}
