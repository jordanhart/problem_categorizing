{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Desktop replacement with good gaming performance.", "Author": "bicho", "ReviewID": "R24ZGL5AARW17A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop with the intent of replacing my aging custom-built gaming desktop and so far it seems to work well for that purpose. The main selling point for me was the Geforce GTX 850M with the new Maxwell architecture. I can play ESO on Ultra settings for hours at a time with no apparent throttling or issues, although the screen near the exhaust fan on the back will get plenty hot. The GPU temps stay in the 70-75 range under load and the fan noise is surprisingly not irritating like I expected, it's more of a gentle 'woosh' or a white noise. The fan noise during normal use is too quiet for me to hear. Overall I'm happy with the gaming performance and it runs everything I've tried (Skyrim, ESO, Bioshock Infinite) at max settings.Some things worth noting:I know the description says the screen is 'matte' but it's still a glossy touchscreen. Perhaps it is less glossy than some but I can still use it as a mirror when the screen is off. That being said, the screen looks amazing! Sharp and bright.Power brick is fairly large, about the size of two Macbook power adapters. Not a problem for me but it does add size/weight.Speakers don't really live up to the hype. Even after tweaking the included equalizer software it still sounds like laptop speakers I've heard in cheapo systems. I've occasionally noticed some distortion during movie playback. They do get loud, however, which might be good for some people. I currently have the volume set to 18% in windows. Edit 4/25: I've 'changed my tune' so to speak. After messing with the eq settings further I've reached a pretty decent level of audio quality for my tastes. I have it sounding good for music now but it really requires the little subwoofer to work, otherwise it's just generic tinny laptop speakers.Included 1TB 5400rpm HDD is a bottleneck. I'm glad it came with this system since it keeps the cost low & I already have a couple Samsung 840 EVOs laying around. I replaced the HDD and now everything is ridiculously fast.The listed dimensions say 17.3\" length, but my tape measure says 15.125\" length.The included DVD drive was not useful for me so I replaced it with a caddy and another Samsung 840 EVO SSD. Sadly I think the performance is bottlenecked by the sata interface (I read somewhere it uses sata I for the optical drive). It might be a better idea to put the original 1TB HDD in a caddy as a storage drive in that case. FYI, the case screws require a t-5 torx screwdriver.Battery life seems ok, I ran it on battery for about 3 hours watching netflix and web browsing. The battery claimed it had almost an hour left.As a first time windows 8 user I found the metro UI to be snappy and responsive but ultimately less useful for me than the traditional windows interface. So I installed classic shell and it's perfect now. Metro is still lurking in the shadows somewhere but mostly forgotten.I'm sure there are more things to add but I've only been using it for a week, I'll try and update later.Update 4/25: After a second week of use I'm still just as satisfied with the performance of this laptop. I put about 20 hours of playtime into ESO with no issues. I saw someone post about replacing the keyboard with a black one and now I'm thinking of ordering the one from the n56jr to see if it fits. The silver on silver blends together too much.", "Date": "April 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "After 6 Months Exactly What I Was Looking For", "Author": "J. Borregoresner", "ReviewID": "R335JPHCBUTPOW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I started my new laptop search over 6 months ago with a few requirements:i7 CPUDiscrete GPU powerful enough to play most games at decent resolutionsan IPS displayQuality chassis buildBack-lit keyboardSurprisingly finding all of these while not spending upwards of $2,000 was nigh impossible.I tried a Gigabyte P35K-CF1 but it had too many quality problems, the screen was unimpressive and it looked like a 1990's IBM Thinkpad.I had the Asus N550JV on my Wish List for a couple of months but couldn't bring myself to pull the trigger due to the GT750M GPU and not being able to see the actual screen.  Getting real information about laptop displays proved to be the hardest part of my analysis; most manufacturers are using cheaper WLED screen - even Alienware and other \"luxury\" models.So when the \"newer model\" option popped up (the N550JK) I decided to make the dive.Performance wise this notebook is amazing, especially considering the price.  I also swapped out the slow HDD ro a Samsung SSD and boot times are ridiculously quick.  Although the display is touchscreen, I immediately installed Stardock Start8 and almost never use the touch screen option.But that is all moot because the display is absolutely gorgeous.  My last laptop was a 2011 HP Envy that had a Radiance IPS display, so I was spoiled by a bright, crisp display with a high color gamut.  Nothing I looked at had a comparable display along with the CPU and GPU power I wanted - until now.  The display on the N550JK is just as nice, if not nicer.  For those that bash \"glossy\" screens then this might not be for you. But if you can find a matte finish screen with a brightness and color gamut even remotely close to this then I applaud you - I could not.  This is why specialty PC maker XoticPC offer a high color gamut (read: glossy) display option on almost every laptop they sell.My gaming is focused now on Elder Scrolls Online and I can run the game at full HD with most settings at high; it performs smooth as silk..While others may not be impressed with the sound, I never expected my laptop to be an audiophile device - that said I have yet to experience sound quality this good in a laptop (and I've been in IT for 20+ years).The only other change I'm making is to replace the keyboard with a black key/back-lit one - not because the current one is faulty/bad but I am a visual hunt and peck typist and the white back-lit keys on silver is hard to see in a dark environment with a bright screen.I don't care for the touchpad but to be honest I've never found a touchpad, thumb stick or any other laptop navigation device I even remotely could tolerate - I've used a wireless Logitech mini mouse and turn off/disable the on-board device.For those of you wondering about the GTX850M - I bench marked the GTX765M on the Gigabyte before returning it and ran the same tests (3DMark Advanced) and the 850 is significantly better:GTX850MCloud Gate 14172Fire Strike 2852Ice Storm 103568GTX765MCloud Gate 9066Fire Strike 2508Ice Storm 47950In summary I challenge anyone to find another currently available notebook that combines the performance, design, build quality and screen quality for under $2,000.  If you do, post it here and I will make a public Mea Culpa.", "Date": "April 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "The best mid-range multimedia option", "Author": "Jake", "ReviewID": "RIXJ48F63PBK5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The N550JK admittedly doesn't come with any special specifications that make it glaringly obvious that it sits high on the roost as one of the best multimedia laptops around, but really what you don't initially read, or pay attention to, is what makes it stand out.First off, to a lot of people, a touch display isn't a really special feature and most fear that they are paying for something they may not use. Let me clear this up by saying that you aren't just getting a touch display, you're getting a high-end IPS (In Plane Switching) display with great viewing angles and incredibly good color reproduction. This is especially valuable to people doing a lot of photo editing or graphic design. Even the more casual Photoshop user, or even one who is going to commonly enjoy movies on their laptop will truly appreciate this screen.Secondly, build quality is fantastic. ASUS is well known for making some of the highest quality machines on the PC laptop market, I swear by them as a brand and they have never let me down. The N550JK is no exception to this as it looks and feels very sturdy, and you won't be tempted to leave it at home in fear of it being easily damaged. While it is no ThinkPad, it doesn't flex around on you like some laptops with a cheaper manufacturing process.It's GTX 850M graphics, although not the highest end graphics card around, is well capable of playing any game on the market with relative ease. You shouldn't expect to get the ultra settings on the newest games,  but there isn't anything around right now that it can't play on relatively high settings.The back-lit chiclet keyboard, to me, is quite comfortable, and the laptop isn't cluttered with useless media control buttons that can be easily hit by accident while typing out a long message or playing games, which to me, is a huge benefit.The touchpad works perfectly well. While not as intuitive as an Apple's touchpad, it worked perfectly well for me in my time using it and had no glaring issues.Battery life on this machine is quite decent, actually. Compared with most laptops with real gaming capabilities, its 4-hour (can get a little more with some settings tweaking) battery life is nothing to scoff at really. For a 15.6\" laptop with an i7-4700HQ, it's actually pretty respectable.All in all, it's a solid laptop and is extremely popular for a good reason. It checks off a lot of boxes for what someone would ask for in a laptop. It's not excessively heavy that a college student couldn't carry it from class to class, and it could survive a couple of classes without needing a charge. What it does lack is a faster hard drive and a removable battery. Two things that should be considered by ASUS in their next iteration of the product, but definitely not enough to remove it from the list of one of the best laptops around right now.", "Date": "May 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Strong desktop replacement", "Author": "D. Patton", "ReviewID": "R2Y8VO7R8MZUTN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In looking for a desktop replacement I was looking for specific items. Speed, utility, and graphic muscle (as much  as an all around laptop can give). After long research, this was the only machine that met those needs.Processor: The i7 runs flawlessly and I have yet to put it through a true challenge.... Not bottlenecks here.Screen: I've always thought anything over 1080p is overkill. This screen to me is perfect. Very sharp and well constructed. Touch was a bonus, and I can honestly say in a windows 8 environment I am actually enjoying having that functionality. Very responsive. Only con is there is a little glare, but not bad.Hard drive: for the price point, something had to give, and it is the HD. At 5400 rpms it truly is the bottleneck. However, for the price, a quick u/g to a solid state for about $250 was no problem, and now it is lightning fast, and data is more secure now.GPU: fantastic value for the money. The gtx runs well. So far I've played guild wars 2 and civ 5 on max settings, no probs. movies are very sharp and smooth.Battery: good battery life considering the power. I get about 4.5 hrs in regular usage flipping between movies, gaming and productivity.Keyboard/touch pad: overall good quality. Full num pad is a bonus, and backlight keyboard is good. Keys feel ok...not great, but ok.Case: nice brushed aluminum casing. Very sturdy. I took it apart to put in SSD and went back together very well. Very solid feel to it.Weight: this sucker is heavy relative to a MacBook Air etc, but really apples and oranges. This IS a desktop replacement, and with the DVD drive, GPU and 15.6\" monitor, it weighs a little. I was prepared for that and not an issue.Summary: I have zero regrets, and this is a very well made product, at a perfect price point. Bravo ASUS!", "Date": "May 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it! Upgrade to SSD a necessity.", "Author": "Saulo", "ReviewID": "R2FNJQV9TY4IP6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "*Update 6.11.14*I've had the computer for a few weeks now so I feel I have a perspective of it. I believe I have found the annoying part of the trackpad. The right and left buttons are basically one single button, so if you are used to right/left clicking on a trackpad that had a separated right/left button, this laptop will be a bit annoying. It isn't a big issue but you do have to move your finger quite a bit to not keep on opening the left click menu. It would have been great of those two buttons were physically separated.Aside from that I have bought a few games that were on sale to test the graphics on the laptop. I got most grand theft auto's (3, VC, SA and 4), the graphics of those games aren't good since they are old, but the laptop handled those games without any problems. I tried a few other games that are more graphical demanding (Metro 2033, Sniper Elite V2 and Watch Dogs). I didn't expect this laptop to handle Ultra settings at 1020x1080 because of the DDR3. Since I wasn't expecting a great performance so I didn't do (or know how to) do all those test you see on youtube. But to my untrained eyes (I come from playing console games) the laptop handled all those games extremely well on ultra settings. It did not seem choppy at all and while I don't know what FPS it was running, I didn't see any lagging.The laptop did get pretty hot if you have it on your lap, so I put it on top of a fan thing and it was working well. I heard that heat eventually damages the laptop so I did ended up turning the settings down to low (@1020P) on all games (I thought that low settings were super bad, but they really aren't bad, IMO)just so the laptop wouldn't get as hot and hopefully it last me a 4+ years.Needless to say, I'm still a happy camper :)*******************************************************************I was in the market for a laptop that would last me many years, and I believe I found it.I had been researching for a future proof laptop since my previous one had died after 5 years. I wanted something powerful with a touch screen. There weren't too many options since most laptops had integrated graphics. My choices ended up being this, or the Lenovo Y50. This one was cost a bit less and does have a lower end graphics card, but it does the job for me. I don't game much, so I really didn't need the Y50.The laptop itself seems to be top quality. I read many complaints regarding the touchpad, the keyboard and the speakers, but I really can't complain about them. They have been up to my expectations. The touchpad has certain gestures that I find annoying, but those can be turned off. I type around 40-60 words per minute, so I really can't say what would happen if I was a faster typer. The speakers are on the bottom of the laptop, so if the laptop is on your lap, it will sound different, but that is the same for anything. For it to sound good it needs to be on a flat, sturdy surface. I haven't really used the bass speaker since it is a annoying to be stuck to a short cable.Battery does only last anywhere from 3-4 hours on regular use. I have only played SimCity5 and put the graphics to the max of the game and I get around an hour of gaming before need to connect. One thing that I have noticed is that you need the computer to be connected to a power source so the graphics card performs to its max, if it is not connected  SimCity seemed to lag. I can only expect it to lag a lot more (if not connected) on other more graphic intensive games.The computer comes with a HDD with 1TB. The 1TB is partitioned in two. One is for the OS and the other is for general media. The HDD is rated at 5200RPM which is really slow for any laptop. I went ahead an installed a SSD. I installed the Crucial M500 240GB. You can choose others, as long as it is a 7MM, 2.5Inch, SATA drive. It cannot be an MSATA. I Installed the SSD where the HDD was, so you need to perform \"surgery\". I am technically inclined, but I had never installed anything into a laptop. Needless to say, it was really easy. If you need help YouTube \"SSD installation for N550JV\" This laptop is the N550JK model but the JV model is basically the same. I Then ordered a HDD caddy and removed the optical disc drive and installed the HDD there. Make sure that the HDD caddy is 9.5MM, universal one worked for me. One thing to note if you are planning on upgrading to a SSD, you need to install the OS into the SSD. To save you some trouble just google \"n550jk mini review\" and click on the link that takes you to forum.notebookreview, go to post#34, click on the link and download the \"Windows 8.1 Core/Pro\" DO NOT DOWNLOAD the \"Core/Pro N\" it will give you an error while installing. The REG Key is installed into the system itself so you don't need to worry about finding a key, it will automatically include it. Also install the HDD into the caddy AFTER you have installed the OS into the SSD.All in all I love this laptop. I highly recommend it and know that you won't be let down.

There is a fair bit of flex at the bottom side of the laptop, but other than that, the build quality is solid. The USB port feels a little tight though. The Ethernet port mechanism requires visual fiddling to plug In, unlike some other laptops where the mechanism is easier to use.Gaming performance is great alongside with the dual-fan cooling system; played through Bioshock Infinite on ultra settings for about 7 hours straight in sunny Singapore without having the CPU and GPU throttle itself.On the audio side of things, I do think that the sound quality is a little overhyped, it is still relatively tinny (in terms of bass, even with the included subwoofer). The speakers can be very loud, though, and that's a good thing for some people.One thing I have to note is that Ubuntu/Linux support works out of the box, even with Secure Boot enabled (the default). So if you're thinking of dual-booting with Windows, this laptop handles that perfectly. I installed Ubuntu Linux 14.04 LTS. In terms of hardware compatibility, these are my points:- GPU: The out-of-the-box configuration works fine, but the system defaults to using the Intel card. As it is with any other laptop with nVidia Optimus, one needs to install Bumblebee for power savings and to unlock the nVidia card. As of time of writing, the proprietary nVidia drivers that are available on Ubuntu's package repositories are not compatible with the GTX 850M in this unit; the GTX 850M requires the nvidia-337 beta drivers to work. There are some ACPI errors when toggling the card power state with Bumblebee as found in the kernel log, but it doesn't seem to affect functionality.- Audio: Realtek audio has always been well supported on Linux. Everything works out of the box, including the subwoofer that comes with the laptop. However, the volume slider for the subwoofer is disabled for some reason.- WiFi: This laptop comes with Intel's dual-band 7260 AC adapter. It works out of the box, but I have not tested it with any AC-based networks.- Bluetooth: Works out of the box too.- Sleep: Sleep works on this model! Many laptops have trouble with sleep on Linux, but this one works perfectly!- Hotkeys: Unfortunately, the display backlight hotkey does not work on Linux, unless you pass \"acpi_osi=\" to the kernel command line. I suspect the issue can be fixed with a UEFI update. The keyboard backlight hotkey, to my surprise, works out of the box (as opposed to on Windows, where the ATKACPI driver is required).- Touchscreen and touchpad: Works perfectly on Linux, including multitouch.(Note: I have replaced the built in hard disk with a Samsung EVO 840 SSD. It is great that ASUS does not void your warranty if you open up the bottom cover. This also means that the cooling vents can be cleaned up easily if dust builds up over time. As others have noted, the bottom cover is secured using Torx screws rather than the conventional Phillips one, so you might want to prepare that if you intend to replace any of the components.)", "Date": "May 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Beautiful and Fast", "Author": "Dennis L.

For that, it works perfectly. It runs advanced software, as well as higher end games, fantastically. The keyboard works great, and I've actually found myself using the function hotkeys, something I've never really done before on a laptop. However, there are two reasons I gave this laptop a 4 rather than a 5.The track pad is abysmal. It's really not a problem for me, since I use an external mouse 99% of the time, as well as this laptop having touchscreen capabilities. Though regardless, something really needs to be done about the track pad on the laptop. The surface isn't great for dragging your finger across, the clicking is awful (at one point the clicker just wouldn't be pressed down anymore, so I had to stop what I was doing and push down on it as hard as I could several times to get the click back) and even when it does work, there's a very small range as to where you can click. Everyone I've showed this laptop to that's used it has agreed that it's terrible. However, luckily, you can simply tap the pad to click, tap it with two fingers to right click, and slide with two fingers to scroll, which I have found myself using much more often than the actual clickers.The 2nd problem with this laptop, as mentioned in other reviews, is the hard drive. The loading times can get a little annoying sometimes, and I plan on swapping this hard drive with a solid state drive.Also, anyone making a point of buying this laptop to be the included subwoofer is going to be disappointed. I either use Bose speakers or headphones, meaning I'm never going to use the subwoofer, but out of curiosity I tried it. It's grainy and doesn't present sound well.Other than that, the specs on this laptop are great for the price, it's fast (once everything's loaded) and can handle a lot of things running at once, and everything else about my experience with this laptop has been great.", "Date": "June 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Michael J Curran", "ReviewID": "R1MIOHWZY3R8CJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love it!

If you have not been using a current edition of Windows or are new to Windows, this will really take some adjustment.  Windows pushes you into a tight Microsoft orbit.

In fact, prepare to change your email address.  There is a work around if your current mail account is POP3.  But it is a WORKaround.  Not simple.In 8.1, there are 'apps' for a command prompt, etc.  But you have to look for them.And if you have not used a touch screen computer, take the time to actually read the e-manual.

I'd checked notebookreview for benchmarks on the GTX850M before ordering, and they seem to be pretty much on track with their charts.Cons:Opening the chassis was not difficult, but did leave me searching my tool box.  Rather than the standard phillips screws you'll encounter on a laptop, this uses torx.  Tiny torx.  The smallest marked torx driver I had was T6, and that was a bit large, but I did have a smaller unmarked driver, think it came with a phone lcd repair kit.  Anyway, I'd guess a T4, maybe T5.  The bottom of the chassis is all one piece, 10 screws, and plastic tabs across the back.  On the plus side you don't have to remove the front bezel or keyboard like most traditional designs, and no where near the disaster of their netbook lines (looking at you ASUS 1005HA-B).The hard drive is slow. I have to believe that's what's holding the system back. It's a Samsung ST1000LM024(HN-M101MBB), 5400RPM.  I opened the chassis day one to put an SSD in, but unfortunately the drive wouldn't ghost properly, didn't carry over the EFI boot partition or recovery partition, and wouldn't boot, and couldn't reinstall directly.Yes, I could have used gparted or HDD clone to manually recreate the drive on the SSD, but come on, this is a new rig, didn't have the patience to go through that. Also, I was going to replace the optical drive with a 7200 1TB, but the DVD caddy hasn't arrived yet, so I'll have to open it again anyway, I'll do it then.The included sub is... Well, I didn't really notice a difference when it was plugged in, and haven't had it attached since the first trials.  I'm not really an audio guy anyway, so my opinion is somewhat unreliable.Keyboard feels nice, backlights are great, with many brightness levels.  However, it seems to miss keystrokes about once a paragraph, or perhaps I'm just typing too quickly or not pressing each key firmly enough.On day three now, got home from work, opened it up to find it SUPER slow and the touchscreen not working.  I had it running downloading a few hundred gigs of steam and origin games, so thought maybe it glitched somewhere and rebooted.  Reboot took a few minutes. Touchscreen still didn't work.  Opened device manager, saw it refreshing constantly, as it would during hardware detection, with the HID devices expanded.  No errors or warnings.  HID device was disabled. Enabled it, refreshing stopped, touchscreen worked, system resources were no longer being hogged by device discovery.  Back on track now.Overall:You may ask why I gave it 3 stars with all the listed cons.  I consider this to be an exception, rather than the top quality I normally get from their ASUS equipment.  Even with the slow HDD, the system has been reasonably snappy, and who knows if my drive ghosting may have caused issues with the original system drive?  I chalk it up to  combination of new hardware (GTX850M, touchscreen on a gaming device?), my high expectations, and perhaps some issues with W8.1.1 and drivers.  Overall, I do love it.  It's replacing a slightly aging ASUS g73, which held up admirably, but is just a giant now in a shrinking world, and I intend to give it a bit longer to shake out.If you're on the fence about it, I might wait to see what the Y50 prices out at, especially with its GTX860, but even with its faults, I'm going to hold onto this one and see what happens.", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Its a nice laptop..provided it works..", "Author": "Philippe Francois", "ReviewID": "RO4Q5IT79DMP3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop to replace my dell studio 15. I needed alot of RAM, the touch screen is useful because 3D models can be manipulated by people I present them to without them having to ask for the mouse/keyboard. The backlit keyboard was fine, I'm not picky about cosmetics so if the keyboard backlight was bleeding, I wouldn't know. But the laptop design is gorgeous, a lil heavier than regular 15.6\" laptops but the design is nice and fresh. There are some design flaws as stated already (the cd drive sticks out a bit and the keyboard buttons feel kinda cheap. But overall, the laptop is very nice and has more than sufficient power and memory for heavy computation and graphics from MATLAB and COMSOL applications... if it would only WORK!!The problem is a day after I got it, if I adjusted the screen position, the screen cuts off. Occasionally, even when I am simply browsing or just randomly, the screen will flicker grey and then go out. Ill often have to turn the laptop off and turn it back on, to get back anything on the screen, and only sometimes this will work.I have just sent this to return to Amazon for a refund. I think I will go back with a Dell. My Dell Studio lasted me through 3 years of engineering school and a year of IT work. My other friends who have purchased Asus laptops have problems of all sorts as well that cannot be easily fixed. My suggestion is, stay away from Asus until they get there stuff together. I gave this 2 stars because I want to warn people that yes although the laptop is nice ..beware..", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Subwoofer plug defective - not covered on warranty", "Author": "Robert Buchanan \"BuchananR\"", "ReviewID": "R3EWKZPMWXIRPU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Two hours after receiving the laptop I tried to plug in the subwoofer.  Immediately the plug broke (in no way did I mishandle or force the plug).  Next morning I contacted Asus and was told that the subwoofer was not covered  under the warranty for physical damage.  Asus advised me to contact Amazon or to buy/repair at BestBuy.  The Asus customer service rep told me how great Asus is and how they're always striving for perfection.  Trying to get Amazon to do anything but a complete return is next to impossible.  I can't even send a message about this order to Amazon (other than this comment).
