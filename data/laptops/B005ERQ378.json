I enjoyed this computer refurbished for $114.97 from Ebay.com. However, after three months of use, the processor slowed up real bad. The computer's good and fast depending on what you do with it.Pros: Fast in the beginning, good for the price, all types of port (besides HDMI), and durable.Cons: Slow as it gets used for more than two months and sits in inactivity, Battery's terrible, Hinges are not great.Will list it on this listing.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not bad for $100", "Author": "Acier \"Man of Steel\"", "ReviewID": "R1EW9Z12QY2BHK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The laptop came with only 45 minutes on the battery, and it's running an old verion of Windows (XP), but it's a nice, sold Dell, everything works, and anyway for $100 what do you expect?Bought it for my 3 boys for Xmas and now they're happily doing their homework on it, playing on-line games, and even watching DVDs.
