It's fast, durable and still feels like a new laptop after almost a year of ownership. I say this because after owning an Acer Aspire laptop for a year, it felt so outdated and slow that I had to upgrade.The keyboard is great and so is the touchpad; except, that the tiny bumps on the touchpad have a flat stop in the middle now.The screen is nice a clear as well as very bright. Wifi on this is better than most laptops as I can get WIFI from 5th floor in a old concrete building in Chicago! (My n320 netbook can barely see the signal and I get 4 bars with this SONY)", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent, but noticeable flaws", "Author": "Wordup", "ReviewID": "R2NBTF2SP0M14D", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros: light, fast, keyboard feels good, big screen, and has a built-in 10 key.Cons: touch pad keeps moving the cursor while I type, glossy screenproduces too much glare, the \"delete\" button is too small, battery life is weak.Verdict: I'd rather buy a Lenovo ThinkpadI've used the Thinkpad many years before getting the VAIO and I likedit a lot, because it had the matte screen (less glare) and I didn't have anyproblems with the touch pad; I disabled the touch pad and used the nipple. The main downside of the Thinkpad is that it doesn't have a built-in 10 key.", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not good piece of equipment", "Author": "Pedro M. Blotta \"Pedro\"", "ReviewID": "R6GVDJ1925LVG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am not a computer expert. Just someone who uses a laptop to work and have fun.I work with an HP and with this VAIO, that was supposed to be a \"home laptop\".It works \"fine\"...but Sony is not good designing laptops at all. Things that shouldbe very well known for any laptop designer, like the touchpad annoing interference when you type wore left insecond place... in an hp you can find very quick ways to disable it, for instance, but in vaio youhave to find through google..than find it in your computer.... but if you need to open an veryheavy and bad designed picture browser, you find it right on a button.... Ok it`s just one example...but thereare many others....little details (in mine, when i hibernate it, when it restarts it came back like if it have crashed...Sony online team just asked me install a new service pack.....and it kept not working...Looks like they gave the design task to a designer who never really worked with a good laptop...Sorry about that...if you find it to be very, very cheap. Go arread. It`s better than nothing...butotherwise, go to a lenovo or an hp...Regards,Pedro", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "worst laptop i've ever used", "Author": "yan hao", "ReviewID": "R2NN1ZYHHHSTKC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this laptop as a gift from Christmas.  i don't have any other apps installed on this machine other than i-tune.  i don't use it often because it is the slowest laptop i have ever used and seen!!! everytime i use it I wanted to bang my head on the keyboard because it is soooooo SLOW!", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0045QPPE6"}}
