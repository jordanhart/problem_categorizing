I did not want thin and light - this machine would rarely leave the house and I would just get a desktop except that, these days, it's nice to be able to move the PC from desk to couch to bed to kitchen for use as a TV, as a phone, as a photo album, as toddler entertainment...The HP was on sale and provided the absolute max amount of screen for the dollar, and that was the deciding factor for me.  Unlike a few years ago, most current laptops now have tremendous similarity in design and subcontractor components, so they all have decent keyboard, memory, hard drive, webcam, etc.  But the screen on the HP was enormous compared to others at this price point and the casing had a nice texture.I am very, very happy with this machine.  If you are looking for desktop replacement, go big and you will not be disappointed.  The only minor flaw so far is the miniature up/down arrows mentioned by another reviewer, though you canalways  use the numeric keypad as backup arrows.  I actually like the reprogramming of the useless F1-F12 keys for volume and other functions (a la Mac Book Pro) and consider this a plus.Again, great value, great feel, freaking giant screen.

Unfortunately, you can't replace the fan without ripping the entire laptop apart (I successfully did this with my old one, but it took many hours). I watched my laptop overheat more and more often until a mere flash video was enough to do it. I finally ditched it and built a very nice PC. In retrospect, this laptop only deserved 3-4 stars. It was so cheap for its specs when I bought it that I really didn't expect an amazing machine, but for the 2.5 years before the fan broke, I felt like I got a deal. Would I buy an HP laptop again? Probably not. This is the second one I've owned that has had a fan problem, both in under 3 years.

I considered a similar Toshiba offered as a special at the same price by Costco but decided against it because I don't like the feel of Toshiba keyboards and their machines in general seem to have a lower quality feel and look about them.  Dell also was offering a similar, discontinued model for a hundred dollars more.  I've owned several Dells and have nothing against them but I wanted to try a different brand and this was $100 less.  I immediatley liked the feel of the keyboard as opposed to the Toshiba. I also like the look of the silver case, much classier than either the Dell or the Toshiba. I've only owned the machine a short while and so cannot speak to it's long term reliability but so far it is fast and easy to use with no problems.  It comes with a 320GB hard drive.  I wish it had 500GB as the Toshiba did.  But, truth is, 320 is perfectly adequate for most peoples needs.  I also wish it had a backlit keyboard as the Toshiba did and so did my previous Dell laptop.  I miss that.

I just turned on the computer, and the card read my router and I was up and running on the internet in just 5 minutes! (Having the built in card on this desktop like the laptops do was a MUST for me. Also, the internet runs so quickly with this card in the computer, I am just amazed!2) The Hard Disk is so so quiet, even when it runs it is hard to hear and the hard disk does not run often. (Good signs!)3) Love the \"standard like 101 keyboard\" which has a seperate number pad like the large standard keyboards do. This is one of the main reasons I wanted a 17.3 vs a 15.6 HP Laptop was that I like having a number pad!4) This laptop runs much cooler than my last laptop did,however, I bought a cooling fan and I placed the computer on top of this and it runs very very cool. (I would not own a laptop without a separate cooling fan as laptops tend to run hotter than desktops do).5) Love the Windows 7 Home Premium that is on this computer. In my last computer, I had Vista and I had a love/hate relationship with Vista. So this experience so far with Windows 7 has been great.6) The keyboard is almost totally silent, something I love! It did take about 2 weeks for me to get used to this FLAT ISLAND STYLE KEYBOARD because I am a touch typist and used to the clanky clank type of keyboard. Now, I love the flat and quiet keyboard.CONS:** NONE WITH THIS LAPTOP PC at all, it is PERFECT!However, with Windows 7 here is my experience:* Before buying this superb HP 17.3 Laptop in August,2010, I thought about it for more than six months! So I bought this HP Laptop and also the HP P6510F Desktop and love them both! I knew I wanted an HP 17.3 laptop and this one is just perfect! I am used to upgrading over the years as each time I buy a new computer with new Windows, I have found I had to buy all new software as most of the old softwares would not run with the new Windows program. In addition, about 50% of the time, I had to buy a new printer as well. The last two times I bought a new system, with Vista and now Windows 7, I was able to update the driver of my printer online and install with no problem.

Speaking of the keyboard, bought this type model so we'd have the 10-key on the right, (I use it ALL the time.) and lots of real estate for wrists.  We don't use inboard mousepads, they're too slow for us, so we just plugged in a standard MS Optical Mouse and it's worked instantly and perfectly since day one.Seems to want to overheat a bit so we bought a stand for it, helps a little.

I still miss the straightforwardness of XP.  Hard to find anything, settings changed just revert back so I've given up trying to customize.

Right out of the box this computers performance was mediocre at best mainly due to the vast array of HP programs (gimmicks)that come pre-installed. After about three months of ownership this HP product really started showing its evil and ugly face. It all started with what appeared to be a problem with the video/graphics card and/or its drivers. If you try to play streaming videos from the web with the sound on it will simply crash....every time! After several calls to HP and dozens of attempts to troubleshoot and fix the problems using the HP support programs, I have come to the conclusion that this laptop is really just that bad. Another problem that I have encountered that absolutely blows my mind is its inability to connect to other HP brand products. My wifes father gave her a really nice HP printer for Christmas and it takes 30 minutes to connect to the printer every time you want to print something. This is a prime example of how poor HP products really are, my Cannon printer works every time. After months of being angry at this laptop my wife took it for herself and made me buy a new Dell brand laptop. I am counting the days that it takes for her to finally loose her mind and throw it in the garbage. In a nutshell, this product may be just fine if you use it for simple web browsing and simple programs only. Be prepared for extremely slow product updates, extremely poor tech support, and an endless amount of crashes, reboots, and lost data.
