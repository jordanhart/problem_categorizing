Nerius", "ReviewID": "R278NHRQSWCNBB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this product to replace a 15\" MacBook Pro with the primary goal of having an ultra-portable computer with reasonable power and battery life.The pros: - Fantastic battery life. Running Windows 8, I'd get 6 hours or so. Running Arch Linux, I'd get up to 8. - Speedy. This system is quite fast for being as slim as it is. I definitely couldn't complain about the power. - Attractive. This was the first laptop that wasn't an Apple product that I felt really stood out from a style and build quality standpoint.The cons: - Backlight bleed. - Backlight bleed. - Horrible backlight bleed.I ultimately returned this after I couldn't handle the splotchy backlight bleed around the edges of the screen. I went through three systems before finally giving up so it definitely wasn't just a single defective unit. This system will be fine for some users, but if you are a developer and spend much of your time in terminal windows or darkly colored IDEs, the backlight bleed will kill the experience. I have multiple photos of each unit, so I may post at some point.I can't in good conscience go below three stars since overall, the machine has very solid hardware. That said, I'd probably put this in a 2.5 / 5 category due to the screen. Fantastic screen resolution (1080p) but just couldn't handle the white glow.", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "A bomb in disgiuse", "Author": "Jens Kunstmann", "ReviewID": "R2BRJLMW5751QU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I loved this laptop right from the first day. It is a high quality product with a very stylish look. It is very light and at the same time very powerful/super fast.If you want so: it is like a MacBook Pro in the look of a MacBook Air.It is also worthwhile noting that the Dell XPS 13 works very well with Ubuntu Linux. All the hardware is properly recognized and even the special keys work.I wanted a dual boot system that runs Windows and Linux and is just works nearly perfectly for both operating systems.This is exactly the laptop I wanted and it holds what it promises.And I cannot get enough of its stylish look. It almost became an intimate relationship.... my Dell XPS laptop an me .... :-)", "Date": "September 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "WORST LAPTOP EVER!!! DO NOT BUY IT!!!", "Author": "T. Falk", "ReviewID": "R3HSYAAHGLIVP9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this computer for my fiance for school and it has been a complete NIGHTMARE. Google Dell laptop cursor problems or mouse problems. The computer randomly will select things when you dont even touch it! She cannot even use the computer because while using it the computer will select a different window, or tab, or paragraph etc etc. We have told dell of the problem and been through hours and hours of customer service bull crap. Every time its someone who barely speaks english and they have us do that same perfunctory steps that we have already done. Finally they replaced the mousepad and mother board. Guess what?? IT STILL HAS THE SAME EXACT PROBLEM. I then spent 3 hours on the phone trying to get them to replace the laptop.....they wouldnt do it!! I called multiple times to talk to a manage and each time the manager was \"IN A MEETING\" which means they either were lying or do not have managers. Lastly we sent it in to get repaired through dells 3rd party company. They replaced the hard drive and the operating system. YET AGAIN THE SAME PROBLEM PERSISTS!! DELL SELLS CRAP COMPUTERS AND THEY KNOW THEY ARE CRAP!!! HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE HAVE THIS SAME PROBLEM, LOOK ONLINE AT FORUMS!! I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER DELL AGAIN, TERRIBLE PRODUCT AND TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!! DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER IF YOU WANT IT TO BE ANYTHING MORE THAN A PAPER WEIGHT!!EDIT: DELL HAS DISABLED REVIEWS ON THE DELL WEBSITE...AFTER LOG IN AND CLICKING ON THE \"WRITE REVIEW\" BUTTON YOU GET REDIRECTED TO THE COMPUTER SALE PAGE!!

Aluminum anodized, fast and reliable. The ssid hard drive works very fast, and boots in 5 seconds.Tha battery is not as good as the rest of the pack, it doesn't last more that 4 hours, not even close to the 7 hours of the Samsung ultrabook.The other thing is the heat.

I'm running Linux Mint 16 (completely wiped the Windows install), and everything from the WiFi to the keyboard backlight to the touchscreen just worked without any intervention. In fact, everything worked too well -- I hate trackpads in general and took me a bit to figure out how to completely disable it in Linux.-decent battery life. At such a tiny weight/size the battery life is one of the tradeoffs. I tend to turn brightness as high up as it will go and I get about 5 hours of battery life doing normal browsing and text editing. More intensive applications are going to seriously dent that.-keyboard is very nice. I bought this as a more portable adjunct to my much heavier ThinkPad. The Dell XPS13 keyboard isn't as good as the ThinkPad's, but its much better than most laptop keyboards I use (much better than most Dell laptop keyboards I've used).-performance is very good, at least under Linux. Much better than I anticipated, actually. You're not going to do serious gaming on this, but I get more than acceptable frame rates from Minecraft. No idea how this performs measures up running Windows 8 (only booted into Windows on this once before wiping).-weight and form factor, obviously. I'm used to lugging around 5 pound+ ThinkPads, so this is a nice change.-heat - after extended use thus machine gets warm, but much less so than other laptops I've used. Occasionally the internal fan kicks on, and the noise is noticable but typical for what I'd expect in a laptop.Negatives:-screen is glossy rather than matte. This is not the worst glossy screen I've used, but I hate the things with a passion. A matte option would have been nice (MS's attempt to turn laptops in to giant tablet is completely misguided IMO).-only two USB ports. Both USB 3.0, but would have been nice to have two USB ports on each side of the laptop, for a total of four, instead of the existing one on each side.-mini-display port. Size probably keeps HDMI out of this, but having to carry around a separate mini-display to HDMI cable is annoying.-WiFi is weak. This may be a Linux-only issue, but lots of reports of frequent WiFi disconnections when the card thinks it is roaming for some reason.-I really prefer laptops that have hardware latches to lock and unlock the display with the body of the laptop for opening and closing. The XPS 13 doesn't have this, and opening it when it is closed is a minor annoyance.Overall:Overall, this is an insanely good laptop and a great value at the price. I do most of my work in a text editor and browser, and this is the perfect compromise in size vs. power for that use case.", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "best laptop ever", "Author": "kevin", "ReviewID": "R13OVT9DMDWYYA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "best laptop ever but you have to get it with Intel i7 this computer is very stylish but if you need something better than a MacBook pro you need to get it with i7 and the 256 gb ssd then you will have a powerful machine with style I use it every day and until now it runs everything I throw on it!!", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Operating system", "Author": "EMILY WATSON", "ReviewID": "R2M2W1ZUGBBT2O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The computer was delivered without the operating system.
