{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Pretty Good Computer", "Author": "Meh \"Meh\"", "ReviewID": "R1SV2TOJPCIQ1I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After blowing up another computer, not from overuse but from downloading a virus, I bought this computer from Best Buy for $630.The PositivesWindows 8 is not hard to learn. Using a Windows mouse ($19 at Best Buy), its easy to toggle between the Windows 8 desktop and a Windows 7-like desk top.Windows 8 apps can be deleted or minimized and you can create your own.  It's actually easier to toggle between apps using Windows 8 than Windows 7.After using it several times, it seems to \"learn\" what you do and the computer speeds up in opening apps and browsers - initially I found it rather slow.I have had no problems with WIFI disconnects except once and I have problems with my WIFI disconnecting anyway, so can't blame the computer.It wakes up instantly from \"sleep\" which I prefer to using rather than completely turning off my computer.Its very lightweight and compact and has a nice feel.The built-in mouse is actually decent to use, responding very well to touch.  I usually hate using them.It does not require you to create recover disks.  It has a recover feature, but have no idea how well that works - bottomline, play it safer and buy an external harddrive for data backup.Has nice quality sound, better than any laptop I've owned in the past.Comes with built in WIFI and bluetooth.The ConsWindows 8 may intimidate at first, but it is actually easy to learn and can be easily modified to meet your preferences.  However, it can be cumbersome as you are trying to learn.  Apps open in Windows 8 do not have a minimize screen.  You have to toggle between them (as I said using a Windows Mouse makes this fairly easy - but a new user will find it cumbersome).Slow at first, but speeds up once you opened apps and programs on the computer.Updates quite frequently which can be annoying.  This comes with Windows 8.0.  There is an 8.1 but there is quite a bit of preparing you have to do for the free download.  Having been burnt before updating a Windows system, I'm not going to download 8.1.Must set up an MS mail account to do anything with a lot of the Tiles on the start window.Comes with a lot of bloatware, including annoying Norton antivirus.  (Suggestion, download Norton's uninstall tool, because Norton is nearly impossible to uninstall from your computer without this tool)Although you can get rid of Norton, the computer has an update tool for other apps and Norton is stubbornly listed so you could accidentally reinstall it.  So far have not seen anyway to get rid of it as an automatic update listing, but you can uncheck it in the list.Does not come with a DVD player and you will have to buy an external drive which will add to the cost, which is around $630.  External drives run around $30 - $80 for something decent.  External drives seems to fail more often than built-ins and so you have to count this as an additional expense to a moderate price computer.I will continue to add to this list as I continue to work with the computer.  The pros outweigh the cons and as I continue to use it, the cons are becoming minimized and I really like this computer.Update: I have to use the recover feature.  It took awhile, but did restore to defaults.  I didn't have any media saved already, but supposedly it won't touch your media.  It did delete recent software downloads (i.e. games and other updates), however, it left a link on the desktop with a list of data the recovery had deleted.  The reason I did the recovery is because I deleted the email tile from the desktop.  Apparently once deleted it's gone (however, make sure you do a search first through the Windows 8 Search \"Charm\" feature), so I had to resort to recovery to get the email tile back.  I'm doing that because I plan to integrate my other email accounts through this tile.  Con:  I may have to set up an MS email account in order to be able to do so.)Update:  It's been a week of hard use and no WiFi problems, even when my DVD couldn't maintain connection with Netflix (as I stated I have problems with WiFi at home - yet no disconnects - although occasionaly slow browser loads, probably due to my Wifi issues).", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome for Linux. Bad for Windows.", "Author": "Alex RE", "ReviewID": "REINWDLYZYB4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop a month ago and I'm happy with it. As soon as I got it I uninstalled Windows and installed Debian, it runs like a charm, everything works out of the box. The materials are sturdy for the price, and the numeric keypad rocks. Overall I'm very happy with this purchase. I was a bit weary to buy because it looked like too good a deal for the price. As soon as I got it I understood all the complaints (annoyingly loud fan and other Windows 8 specific quirks). Honestly, if you're looking for a Linux machine this is a sweet deal. If you're buying it to run Windows, know that the fan is really an issue (a deal-braker for me).", "Date": "April 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Computer", "Author": "Serj Tankian", "ReviewID": "R35GR2I5UZ2V8K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Windows 8 is really easy to use, its also a pretty good program.  Windows 8 has some bugs but that's not this computers fault.  This computer is slow at first but it speeds up the more you use it.  It learns where you like to go and gets faster (at least that's how it seems to me).  This computer is also extremely quiet, the speakers are good for a laptop but still sound like crap as laptops always do.  I absolutely love the blue tooth device, it connects to my sound bar, wireless keyboard, I Pad, Smart Phone, Printer, all automaticly.

It had ENDLESS WiFi disconnects, track pad fails, and blue screens of death.After 2 repairs that did NOTHING to fix these issues, Samsung offered to replace it. I refused the same model so they offered me this. I had offered to take a downgrade, and this IS a downgrade..... I was hesitant since I was losing that faster processor, the 2 MG Gaming Card, and DVD Burner. But I was getting instead, a bigger hard drive, lighter metal body with less weight.Being disabled, that weight is a BIG deal. I already own a new Samsung Series 7 Gaming Laptop for performance as well as a nice Acer Desktop with 23 inch screen for other tasks.I needed this for all day, in my lap, goofing around online.So why just a 3 star rating? Well it IS slower, quite a bit slower. I hope as it caches more data it may speed up a bit? But with this slower processor and same slow hard drive as the last, it makes for a lazy experience. Factor in the seven hundred dollar list price (usually just six hundred best best buy) and you can simply find WAY better specked hardware elsewhere. But I am where I am so I have no way out. The other problem was right off the bat, the same nightmare WiFi issues from the old computer haunt this one as well, even with an entirely different Card! Luckily I knew this beforehand and thanks to a reviewer named dissed who reviews the big brother to this computer, the Samsung ATIV Book 6 15.6-Inch Full HD Touchscreen Laptop (Mineral Ash Black), I knew the fix. It goes as follows per HIS wonderful review:getting rid of the \"intel\" driver and reverting to Microsoft driver.1. Uninstall the Intel Proset wireless software/driver from the computer under control panel uninstall program. (not the blue tooth just the wireless)...after thats done..2. Open device manager/network adapters3. double click centrino advanced-n 62354.click driver tab5. It should say driver provider Microsoft / 12/5/2011 / 14.8.8.756. click events tab to see if driver service added was (NETwNe64)that will fix the drop problems.then fine tune your adapter1. click tab power management / uncheck allow computer to turn device off to save power2. click tab advanced / make sure transmit power is set to highest___________________________________________________________________________________________________________So I tried this and it has been stable for 24 hours.I will update as ANY changes occur. The other reason for the 3 star rating is it only has 3 USB ports, only ONE 3.0 port. Also, you do NOT have a battery you can replace. It AND the hard drive are buried (NOT accessible for owner replacement as is normal on a laptop), build inside the case so good luck if you need a battery or if the hard drive fails. Just WAY too many negatives for me at this price to rate it higher.I would recommend shopping around, reading reviews.Lots and lots of reviews. I see other brands with 1 TB hard drives, faster processors AND with optical drives for this price everywhere. On a positive note, this is a FAR more sturdy computer with a vastly nicer (more solid) keyboard as well. THE construction just oozes quality, UNLIKE THE ONE IN PLASTIC THIS REPLACES. As far as positives go, that is just about it. I hope this Samsung will not be another lemon. I have been a die hard Samsung computer fan boy. But I am sad to say that this will probably be mt LAST......UPDATE Oct 2013:After a month is has become a MUCH faster laptop thank goodness. It is also 100% rock solid stable. Nice change.....Update again on Feb  19 2014: This computer is still a LOT less than the one it replaces and I keep getting mails telling me I am not reviewing the correct computer. It seems a few people are no longer capable of understanding English or I just don't know? My review is for the: Samsung ATIV Book 4 NP470R5E-K02UB 16-Inch Laptop (2.0 GHz Intel Core(tm) i7-3537U Processor, 8GB Memory, 750GB Hard Drive, Windows 8) Mineral Ash Black that replaced my defective Samsung Series 3 NP350V5C-T01US. Sorry, Iam simply unable to make it any more clear....UPDATE Feb 22 2014: Downgrading to 2 stars. It continues to be a battle to prevent updates to device manager items that in turn PREVENT the computer from operating properly. I am simply tired of this battle and will be moving on to anew laptop. Just ordered 2 lesser models that actually OUTPERFORM this so called \"power user\" model. Ordered the:-Sony VAIO SVF1532BCXB 15.5-Inch i3 Laptopand-Sony VAIO SVF1532DCXW 15.5-Inch Touchscreen i5 LaptopGiven the price of this thing and continuing bugs that Samsung refuses to correct it should be downgraded to 1 star.What a disappointment!", "Date": "September 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent buy", "Author": "Joyce Minarik", "ReviewID": "R16G696R9ZRVCF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nice feel.

Initially out of box this thing is really nice. Build quality is spot on(not alot of flex, quiet fan, ultra sharp display when plugged in).Once Windows was set up and it started to update things started to go downhill and we wound up returning it for something different.1.) As the computer started to update it started to bog down really bad and became unbearably slow. on top of this the websites my wife needed for her schooling wouldn't run as the flash player crashed. I attempted to install Chrome and try again but failed that as well so that tells me that its something to do with the notebook. The mouse began to act a little weird (not click, ghosting and random clicking when hands were nowhere near it)2.) Initially the display was vibrant and bright, with true colors. But again once updating of windows 8 began once the computer was unplugged the brightness of the display dropped to the bottom and there was no way to bring it up (either through settings or adjusting the power plant).As an end result we traded the laptop in for a touchscreen toshiba that has good ratings. Will post what happens there and hopefully if you purchase this you have better results.", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "LEMON ALERT!
