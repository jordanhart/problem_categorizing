This was a great deal for the price and for what I need it for. Love the slick black color. Not a lot you can do with this other than play with it.I believe this laptop is as good as you will find for a budget laptop. It has 4GB of RAM, a 320GB hard drive, and excellent functionality. Some people may not be used to Windows 8 yet, like another person who reviewed it, but if you take the quick tutotial on Windows 8 online, you can easily adapt and find it's a very good computer. Overall: Good sound quality, A touch pad that works great, Perfect for Business, Big screen size, easy to set up, lightning fast!", "Date": "May 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product for daily usage.", "Author": "decent user", "ReviewID": "RTBIV69Q759Q6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This one is great for all the daily usage, but not powerful enough for gaming. We take advantage of it and purchased this product for our son as his first own laptop. So he could not use it to play 3D games but enough for web browsing, social networking and finishing home work. He like it. We suggest this product for any people who just need a laptop for daily usage. worth every penny", "Date": "June 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good product with good price !

Just something to get around on the internet, check email, and store music and video. For the price of around 350$ this computer is amazing. I found that the harddrive is perfect for people that love music and movies like i do. The camera is a good one. Not amazing but still worth using. The laptop as not froze on me and runs at a very good speed. Takes only about 3 mins from a cold start to me being on the internet. The screen is plenty wide and a great size for music and video. The only downfall is the built in Windows 8 so i wouldn't recommend it to anyone in a gaming stand point but for everyone else youll learn how t use it and move through the interface in about a week.", "Date": "September 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Completely Underpowered Laptop", "Author": "The Nickster", "ReviewID": "R71GOTIW55J7W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ordered this machine for my wife not paying much attention to the chipset.  Now I did convert it to Windows 7 64bit, so perhaps it performs adequately running Win 8.x...but if you're thinking of falling back to Win7, stay away.  About 3/4 of the RAM is utilized just browsing the web...that's the OS and browser, not the machine...but performance is just abominable.  You can watch the CPU spike and stay that way for long periods just browsing or doing simple document editing.  Terrible.  This performance is on a clean install with major-maker antivirus running and nothing else.  Read reviews on this chipset outside of Amazon and you'll see what I mean.", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "HP Laptop", "Author": "Eric H.", "ReviewID": "R11DAYI5KW0TQ6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this specific unit, but I actually got a unit that had a 750 gig drive and a faster processor for the same price. The third party retailer emailed me saying the specifics in the ad were incorrect and offered this one. I am very happy with the unit. I'm not a power user, and this is perfect for what I do.
