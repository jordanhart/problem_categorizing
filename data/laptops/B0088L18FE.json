{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Huge bang for the buck, with caveats", "Author": "M. Wilson", "ReviewID": "R32JSVW4VY9OR3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, let's just get this out there: paper spec-wise, few other laptops can compare to this laptop in my opinion. Laptops with 15\" 1080p IPS screens are very few and far between, and then weighing just 4 pounds and being very thin is icing on the cake. The rest of the system is pretty average for this price range nowadays, but if you haven't experienced a screen like this you might just not realize how big of an asset it truly is.Now, the caveats: the first sample I got had a rattly fan. It was very noticeable, and made me worry that it might break after a short amount of time. Wanting my laptop to last more than a few weeks, I returned it and got another which was quick and painless, but it definitely did not inspire confidence in Vizio's build quality. My second CT15-A1 is fine, but I'm strongly considering the 3 year aftermarket warranty that Amazon offers just in case it has problems down the line. Not only is this laptop priced very aggressively, but Vizio is brand new to the laptop space, so it wouldn't be unreasonable to expect some growing pains with early models. Subjectively, the laptop feels like it's actually built very well. The aluminum body is stiff, and there's very little screen flex. The screen hinge is stiff without being too stiff. There are no obvious build quality defects like bumps under the keyboard or that kind of thing (which I had with my previous Dell XPS M1330).With that out of the way, I do have to say that I truly love this laptop. It's crazy lightweight for the specs. The matte 1080p IPS screen is beautiful, and when calibrated with my X-Rite i1 Display 2 (using the Lacie Blue Eye software), the average dE is less than 0.2. Read: this display is capable of near perfect reference color reproduction. I can do Adobe Lightroom work on this laptop without color reproduction concerns any more, in fact I moved away from a separate monitor to save space on my desk and for a little extra cash.The keyboard is very nice tactile-wise. Before I got this laptop, I was using a mechanical keyboard with Cherry Blue switches. So I definitely appreciate the benefits of a nice keyboard. And while the keys aren't the same as a mechanical keyboards', they're still nice. The travel is pretty limited but there's good feedback. It's not too loud but also isn't silent. Everything's laid out pretty nice, although I'm not a fan of the arrow key setup and I hate the complete lack of home/end/pgup/pgdown navigation keys. I think the default option of the F1-12 keys acting as special function keys without needing to hold fn is an excellent decision. I only ever used F5 for refreshing a page, which can be accomplished by ctrl-r, but on the other hand I need volume, playback, and brightness control very often. One thing I have noticed that could be a problem: sometimes it seems like key presses aren't noticed, and other times it seems like I unintentionally double press a key. I'm a very fast typer (about 90 words per minute on a 1 minute test), so it could be that I'm just being really inaccurate with a new keyboard, but if you're concerned about this I would check for a trend in other reviews.The touchpad is okay at best, and if it's having a bad day it's absolutely terrible. This is my first multi-touch touchpad, so my experience here should be noted as very limited overall. I like the gestures, and scrolling usually works pretty well. I really like that the entire touchpad clicks in for a left click - no more need to keep my left hand on the click button. I dislike that the default option for touch to click is \"on\". This was an amazingly stupid decision that wreaks of limited to no end-user testing. It makes typing almost impossible because there's no palm detection and merely brushing the pad moves your cursor. But thankfully this can be turned off, and as I mentioned previously the push-in-entire-pad-to-click design makes it unnecessary anyway. As another reviewer mentioned, sometimes the touchpad decides to just take a break and turn off. Other times, it decides to get all coked out and just randomly go around the screen, in no clear relation to what I'm actually trying to do. I'm not exaggerating. It's just completely broken in that respect. I have the most recent drivers and occasionally this happens with just no warning at all. It's infrequent enough that it's not critical, but it's pretty pathetic. Finally, it should be noted that there's no off button for the pad. I feel this is OK with touch to click being set off, since then the pad shouldn't randomly click unless you have a habit of bending your wrist to go between your hands and pressing down pretty stiffly, but it's still something some users might be concerned about.So, basically, plan on using a trackball or a mouse with this laptop.The ports are a little limited. Just two USB ports and only HDMI kind of sucks. Lots of projectors are still behind the curve and only have VGA, but the D-Sub connector is huge so I can't blame VIZIO for leaving it out.The headphone audio is really nice. I would consider myself a practical audiophile - I don't believe in $500 power cable snake oil, but I appreciate a good DAC and good pair of cans. In that regard, the audio from this VIZIO is pretty respectable. There's none of the hissing that you get with truly awful DAC/amp combos, but it's also nothing to write home about and the gain is pretty low. Shouldn't be a problem unless you're planning on driving expensive high impedance cans, in which case you're probably the type of person to have an external DAC/amp combo anyway.Also, cool feature sidenote: like smartphones, the laptop detects when headphones are plugged in, and it remembers the difference between last speaker volume and last headphone volume. So otherwise, you can have the speaker volume set to muted but the headphone volume set to average so you won't disturb anyone but still not have to mess with the volume constantly.Finally, the OS experience is very nice. Turning on from standby is instantaneous. Turning on from hibernate isn't blazing fast but still only about 20 or 30 seconds. Turning on from being completely off or restarting takes about probably only 15 or 20 seconds. Not having bloatware is a godsend. This is the first prebuilt I've ever bought where I didn't do a Windows fresh install first thing. I just uninstalled the Bing and Zune crap and I was good to go 30 seconds later. Also, as a sidenote, there aren't ridiculous brand stickers plastered all over the place. The CT15 has a great design that's very nice to look at, and they obviously cared more about the user experience than absurd brand identity/advertising when they were designing it.Final geek note: I haven't tried yet, but I see any kind of hardware changes being difficult or impossible. The entire underside of the laptop is a single piece, so there's no easy-to-access hard drive, RAM, etc. doors. This is frustrating, especially since I'd like to drop in a 512GB SSD in a few months since the prices keep dropping and 128GB is a little small, but I would research into this more if you're considering the laptop and need this capability.Anyway, to summarize, this is an amazing laptop for the price. The screen is superb, and doesn't even require a \"for the price\" qualifier. Everything else is pretty average, with nothing being terrible except the touchpad depending on how much you plan on using it and if you're OK with messing with the settings (very easy to do). The internals are nice, but you might not be able to change them (research this if it matters to you). It's indeed very thin and light, and again at a great price. I recommend it, but consider the quality control risks before buying., and if you're willing to also carry around a mouse or a trackball.Really I would have given this laptop a -1 star for the touchpad, and -0.5 stars for the one I had to replace. But since you can't do out of 10 ratings, I think a 4 is more appropriate because the rest of the laptop is good and the screen is greaet.", "Date": "October 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beauty is skin deep", "Author": "Ziad Krayem", "ReviewID": "R343C88G3ZGBFF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I do purchase lots of laptops each year, as I have a nag for trying new tech.But I like to think that I am in constant search for the perfect gadget and never finding it (be it a laptop, a tablet, a phone, a remote control...)And let me tell you, I have never been torn by a product as much as I did with Vizio CT15-A1The laptop is gorgeous, the screen is amazing, and the build quality is superb. But there are some serious short comings.I had the laptop for nearly a month now, and I stil feel this love and hate realtionship. I can't make up mind wether to keep it or ditch it for another laptop. (either way, in few months, a new laptop must fill its shoes, especially with Win8 on the way)What I love about the laptop:* Looks space-age. And I don't mean like a Macbook Air does (althoug the similarities are stunning), it is the angular design of the screen lid, and above all, the grayish hue on the body.* Excellent construction, with very useful rubber bottom.* Amazing IPS full-HD matte display* Cool charger ligths (abit too bright)What I hate about the laptop:* The touchpad* The touchpad* The touchpad (yes, that much!) of all the laptops I ever used, no touchpad ever came close to the horride experience of this laptop; gestures are erratic, touch sensitivity is horrible, and above all, the touchpad always ignore any minute gesture: to stick the pointer over something small, you must first swipe hard to get the cursor moving and then quickly set the cursor where you want... an exercise in patience.* Short battery life: while doing nothing but surfing the web, I get about 4 hours.* Keyboard is not likeable, but in reality is not as bad as other users have described. and of course, it is not backlit. It would not register some keys if very lightly pressed.* Should not really be called an ultrabook, because it does not standby as other laptops do: if you simply close the lid, the laptop goes on standby, not the deep sleep mode. So in few hours, battery would have dropped by about 20%, and then it goes into hibernate. So, first you are faced with unexpeted reduction in battery, second, you have to wait for the laptop to resume from hibernation, which BTW takes longer than a full boot.* There is a 2GB hibernation partition, which is weird given the laptop has 4GB of memory, so I think it is useless and unused (which might be the cause for the behavior above)* Recovery partition is there, but there is no way to extract it on Media, and, you must boot windows in recovery mode to be able to access it. pretty useless if your main parition is corrupt (which is at times why you would like to do recovery in the first place). It is a weird decision to do this, and maybe it is justified by the fact that the hard drive is not meant to be user replacebale. Or maybe such decision reflects Vizio's inexperience in the PC business world.* Charger is standard size (which is to say big), which is a shame given how beatifully designed the laptop is, and since battery life sucks, leaving the charger behind is not something you would want to do.You can see how many shortcomings there are, and yet I cannot hate the laptop... that should be an indication how beautiful the laptop is :) Beauty is skin deep? yeah, but it got me!", "Date": "October 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "All It Needs Are Accessories To Make It Usable", "Author": "R. Cross \"LVWolfman\"", "ReviewID": "R1BGTRTVIY3NCA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This was purchased from Amazon, but by my boss, not by me.  He was so disgusted with it that rather than return it, he just gave it to me.Weight, looks and performance-wise, this is a good notebook!  Slim, easy to carry and a beautiful screen.However it needs a few accessories to make it what is in my opinion, usable.1.  A wireless mouse or touch pad as the provided touch pad is extremely unusable.  Granted, I'm used to the one on Apple notebooks, but my wife's cheap HP notebook touch pad is much easier to use.  I suggest going with a Bluetooth mouse or touch pad as there are only two USB ports on this computer.2.  A wireless keyboard as the provided one looks great but the keys don't always work.  I have to pay special attention when typing an 'f' or a 'c' for instance as it usually won't appear. Or you'll easily get double keystrokes.  Combined with the native touch pad which I haven't been able to disable, when typing up a report, letter or even a Facebook post, I'll find that the cursor has suddenly jumped up a number of lines and I'm typing in the middle of something previously written.  Again, I suggest a Bluetooth keyboard as there are only two USB ports.  Though if you have a Logitech unifying receiver, you can use one port for both the keyboard and mouse/pad.3.  An external hard drive.  The 128GB SSD is fast.  However, 100GB for applications and data really isn't very much.  I've install the software that I need to use for work, (Adobe Creative Suite, Office 2013, etc.), my documents and very little else.  I ended up with about 41GB free.  I can't install Dropbox as our shared folder would fill the drive.  So, tie up a USB port with an external USB hard drive.  I picked up a 2TB Western Digital that uses USB3 at a decent price.4.  A USB network adapter.  The radio on this thing is WEAK.  Our WiFi router is currently two walls and about 40 feet away.  Every few minutes, I lose Internet access and have to reset the radio by pressing the F3 key to turn it off and then again to turn it back on.  (That same key also disables Bluetooth for some strange reason.)  My wife's HP sitting two feet closer has NO problems.  If I move to within six feet of the router, I can keep a connection a lot longer but it still drops out from time to time.  The latter also applies with my Verizon 4G LTE hotspot sitting 3 feet from the Vizio.  Using a USB WiFi adaptor, I don't get any network dropout.So, if you're willing to spend more money, use the Bluetooth and both USB ports, this is a pretty snappy and beautiful notebook and very usable.On the other hand, I think that if it was MY money being spent, I'd have gone with the Acer at Costco. 8GB of ram vs 4GB, almost as thin but has a DVD burner and 3 USB3 ports and a touch screen perfect for Windows 8.  It only uses a 750GB spinner hard drive so wouldn't be as snappy.  The keyboard is backlit, has a numeric keyboard and types a LOT better.  Even the touch pad is very usable.  I only use the Acer as an example of how for a $100 more, one can get a much better thin notebook.Hopefully, Vizio has learned from their mistakes with their first notebook and has fixed them in the newer models.Pros:  Thin, light, lovely and snappy performanceCons:  Bad keyboard, bad touch pad, weak WiFi radio, limited storage, limited memory and poor expandability. (Remember, like the newest Apple notebooks, what you buy is what you get. Nothing in this is upgradable or expandable.  No swapping the battery, putting in a bigger hard drive or more memory.)", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great design, Horrible computer!", "Author": "Rinaldo Cartaya", "ReviewID": "R1AWQKNGLATAN2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was in the market for a computer that still came pre-loaded with Windows 7, as I have no use for a touch screen in my profession. This machine had all of the specs of the new computers that are on the market like the Asus Vivo Book, or the HP Envy, but it had exactly what I was looking for in the operating system.The machine is the most beautiful computer I have ever seen. But good looks aren't enough to justify keeping a computer. It is actually nicer looking than the Apple Macbook Air, which it was clearly attempting to emulate,  but comes with a 15 inch screen which is noticeably larger and easier to read documents on. However, just like the Macbook Air, I cannot figure out how to use it. Unlike the Macbook Air, it isn't just a new keyboard you must learn how to use, it is a machine that doesn't work, which is far more frustrating.The negatives render the machine worthless.Cons ---1. The Track pad ! -- When I turned the machine on, the cursor was magically moving itself across the screen, and I wasn't touching the computer. I installed the new driver, and it fixed the ghost movements, but now every 15 minutes of use, the machine will literally freeze and you must SHUT DOWN. Just restarting does not fix the problem.2. The Keyboard - I actually like the keyboard, as it is silent when one is typing late at night and does not want to disturb their mate's slumber. However the way they designed the keys, they are 2 times larger than most laptop keys, likely to accommodate the massive keyboard area as they omitted the number pad. Coupled with the track-pad which is exactly where your palms are supposed to be, it leads to one hell of a difficult proposition.3. The battery life.  - The other laptops in this price range with the same features all have 6-9 hours of battery life. This machine averages 3 hours for my use, and I wasn't watching movies or playing games on it, I was typing. I don't know much about computers, but from what I understand, Typing is not as difficult on Battery life as streaming media and online gaming.The Pros1. The machine is a work of art.  - As stated, this would be great if I were to hang it on the wall, but for practical purposes it fails miserably.2. The Screen is the best I've ever seen. The Imaages are crisp, and black is true black. It really is a shame they can't sell their screens to everyone else, as it is incredible.3. Silent - Not only are the keys silent, but the machine doesn't seem to have a fan, or I've never heard one running. It really is noticeably devoid of sound.4. Lightning fast - I'm not sure if it is the SSD hard drive, but it is the fastest computer I have ever used. Opening a file, or a document takes less than 1/10th of a second. I don't render on photoshop, in fact, I don't own Photoshop, but it does everything I have asked it to do with remarkable speed.Bottom line, the machine would be perfect for someone who wants a fashion accessory on their lap or desk. If you desperately want to buy one I implore you to buy an external mouse and keyboard, as using the ones provided on this machine will likely induce you to commit violence.I must compliment their customer service at Vizio, they connected me with an American on a Saturday to discuss warranty repair work. This is something I really am impressed with, and it makes a huge difference. If they can improve their product design issues I would purchase from their product line in the future based primarily on that little detail. Fortunately, I detected the defect in design during my return period with Amazon, so I have decided to deal with them instead and buy a comparable HP machine which also has windows 7 but lacks the defect in design.", "Date": "July 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "If you know what you're buying, it's fantastic", "Author": "NoName", "ReviewID": "REXMDED6CPXP9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for my mom, knowing what she would use it for, mainly Microsoft Office, internet browsing, and streaming videos. So I wanted something light, with mid-range specs and an HD display. I figured the Intel i5 processor would be enough for this, and the graphics driver didn't really matter a whole lot, since she doesn't run graphics-intensive programs. An SSD was a must, ever since I heard that computers are being built with them now. SSDs are faster, quieter, use no electricity, and produce less heat. Since she does quite a lot of typing, I wanted to get her a 15\" laptop because of a bigger keyboard, a significant increase in size from her old 10.1\" netbook. And I also wanted Windows 7. Windows 8 is a hot mess, in my opinion, plus I wouldn't want to to have my mom learn a new operating system.I did am internet search for computers with SSDs, windows 7, and an i5, and couldn't find any below $900. Right before I made a purchase of nearly $1000, I stumbled upon this. It had all the specs I was looking for, with the added bonus of a 1920x1080 matte display. I quit what I was doing and for a few days, read up on the reviews for these. Most agree, it is well built, with flaws, even \"fatal flaws.\" These flaws were the trackpad, keyboard, and lack of ports. Since my mom uses a mouse, I saw the trackpad as a non-issue. The flaws in the keyboard were explained to me, but I really saw it as a matter of opinion. And since the ports would not be used, besides one USB, this also was a non-issue.But I have used the machine, so here's my opinion of these aspects of this computer:1. Trackpad: After the initial boot up, the first thing I did was download the drivers for the trackpad. Yes, it is pretty buggy, and it would get annoying after a while. But I think the problem comes more from the design than the drivers. Your fingers have to be a little greasy to use. I used this with my clean hands, and my fingers would not slide on it. And the left and right click is built right in as a single piece, which means that you can't keep one finger on the click button and another on the touchpad, or it gets confused and the cursor jumps around. But the 2 finger scroll worked pretty well for me. Also, the cursor got stuck a time or two, which is the only software problem with the trackpad, but a simple right click fixes it right up.2. Keyboard: Like I said, I think this is a matter of opinion. The lack of a numpad might scare some people away, but it allows for bigger keys. They are large and have a somewhat slippery surface, and little travel. However, the travel is still substantial enough. When I type, I glide my hands across the keyboard from one to another, instead of pulling my fingers off all the way. And this keyboard works well for that. It is actually the best keyboard I have ever typed on, to be honest. And since my mom has the same typing habits, she loves it too.3. Lack of Ports: You get 2 USBs, a headphone jack, and an HDMI. I don't know what to say about this really. If you need more ports, get a different computer. If that's all you need, you won't have any problems.So who should use this? Anybody looking for a mid-range, light laptop, like students, or people looking to stream movies. Don't buy this for gaming, or graphic-intensive programs. If you have a lot of data, don't get this one either. It is advertised as 128GB of storage. It is never exact. This one is just a bit less, and the OS takes up quite a bit of space, so it comes down to around 75GB of free space out of the box. There is no bloatware to be removed, unless you count Skype and Zune (I removed Zune). And one last thing, the unibody is very nice looking, but if hardware problems occur, this would be very difficult to repair, and very costly and time consuming to have someone else do it (the battery is built in by the way, and upgrading RAM will require a lot of work.)

Of course if you will need an external mouse, especially when you're using the laptop on desk. I guess the mouse pad wasn't built for long-term usage because after a short while it starts to stick.

Xia", "ReviewID": "R1DCNBE78KJCAH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is one of the best electronics purchases I've ever made. I was hesitant at first because I'm very brand conscious. I'd never heard of VIZIO before, so I based my decision on the mostly positive reviews and the incredible value that this model currently represents. I purchased this VIZIO for $650 from Amazon Prime, which is very low when you consider what you're getting.All the other reviews are correct. The 15.6\" 1920x1080 IPS matte screen on the VIZIO is amazing and the best I've ever seen. Apple's MBP has a higher resolution, but the gloss ruins it for me. Comparing the VIZIO to my wife's HP and my mother's Macbook Air, there is no comparison. This screen is top shelf and more than makes up for any other shortcomings.I got about 4hrs of battery life on a full charge just doing web browsing and word processing. That would have been good a few years ago, but many laptops are now getting 7 hours, so this VIZIO gets fairly mediocre battery life. Though, it's a worthwhile sacrifice for such a lovely screen.The 3rd gen Core-i5 ultra-low volt CPU is great even for heavy Excel and Access work. I do get close to using up all 4GB of memory, and I confirmed that you cannot upgrade the memory on this laptop. The memory in the VIZIO thin and light is soldered onto the motherboard.As for the exterior construction, the aluminum body gives the whole laptop a premium feel even though you're paying a low-end price. The keyboard, however, should have been thought through a bit more. My wife's HP has the same dimensions as this VIZIO, but HP managed to squeeze a full-sized keyboard onto their laptop, including a numpad! VIZIO's keyboard doesn't even have Home, End, and Page Up/Down keys. Bad fengshui. The touchpad gets more bad criticism than it deserves because the initial drivers and settings are bad. The first thing you need to do when you get this laptop is update the touchpad drivers and reduce the touchpad sensitivity. Then disable all the multi-touch functions except the two fingered scroll-up and scroll-down. The touchpad will work fine after you do that.Finally, one of the main reasons why I say buy this laptop ASAP is because of wonderful Windows 7. New PC's are being taken over by Windows 8, which is a shame because Windows 8 is a horrible OS. I'm normally a Microsoft fanboy. I didn't even think Vista was all that bad, but Windows 8 is just awful. I bought Windows 8 on day 1 for my desktop. I wanted to like it, but it's a complete non-intuitive piece of junk. The Start screen is a cluttered mess. The apps are useless distractions that do not belong on a desktop or a laptop. The control panel and settings are hidden away in a stupid location. And somehow the search function doesn't work nearly as well as Windows 7. My university refuses to support Windows 8, so the only way they can guarantee that all of our Citrix and .net applications work is by using Windows 7. So there you have it.If this were a $1000 laptop, I would have given it 4 stars. But considering the value and the Windows 7, I'm definitely feeling 5 stars of love.

I use it tons everyday as my *main* computer and workstation(I work online from home).  The screen continues to be the best feature of this laptop and I feel like I got way more than my moneys worth in this area!  I've started watching more and more TV shows/movies online with this ultrabook because the display is simply better than any of my TVs and I can take it anywhere!  I cannot comment much about the trackpad issues because after I updated the drivers/software and tweaked around with the settings I was able to use it in a satisfactory manner...however I HATE using trackpads for my work on the computer so I quickly upgraded to a wireless USB mouse and simply disabled the trackpad whenever it detects an external mouse.  Regardless I just want to emphasize how much the trackpad can be improved by UPGRADING THE DRIVERS/ETC!As far as performance goes....when I bought this ultrabook I never intended to use it for things like PC gaming but the beautiful 1080HD display was hard to ignore and a few months ago I started using this to play SKYRIM!  yeah hard to believe this ultrabook without a real graphics card and only an integrated Intel HD4000 graphics can *easily* handle games on Steam including things like Skyrim...admittedly I did have to turn down the graphics settings to low and turn off a few eye candies but I'm getting a decent frame-rate and having no issues otherwise.So overall after nearly 8 months of heavy duty usage, I can safely give this laptop my recommendations!  It is such a bargain now that the prices have dropped even further and anyone who is looking for a ultrabook without the touchscreen/Windows 8 stuff should really check these out!  Highly recommended!I was originally shopping for a new laptop for under $500 to fit my tight budget when I first stumbled upon the VIZIO Thin and Light Ultrabooks....I had trouble finding laptops in this price range that were not seriously flawed or filled with old, outdated technology....and once I did more research I realized most of these laptops, even ones with larger screens, were unable to display higher resolutions which was a requirement for my new purchases.  As soon as I searched for laptops with quality, high res displays I realized I would not be able to afford them since almost all of them were well over $1,000usd.....i filtered my search down to laptops with good displays and believe it or not the Vizio Ultrabook CT15-A1 was the cheapest model I could find with the full HD, high-res display.....then I looked closer and was shocked to see all the features and quality components/hardware included in the price tag! turbo core i5, SSD hard drive, HDMI output, etc etc etcWhen I unboxed the CT15-A1 the first thing I noticed how clean, modern and sleek it is.  Its got a little bit of weight in a good weigh makes it feel expensive and durable.....its ultra thin!  The display is AMAZING....hands down this is the major selling point of this laptop and it delivers + some!!! its just beautiful IPS anti glare display perfect size for a laptop!  Performance is amazing....this thing is FAST silent and deadly! the SSD allows the machine to boot up in less than 10 seconds and makes Windows run faster than ever!  have not  played any games so I cant comment on gaming performance but I dont think this is designed for serious gaming anyways.I will update this review if I run into any issues or my opinions change but so far I couldnt be happier.

I've heard complaints about the keyboard but I think it has a great feel.Performance- The solid state drive allows the machine to be blazing fast on start up, taking about 15-20 seconds.  However, 128 gigs of storage isn't enough and I would recommend getting an external hard drive to supplement.

I mostly use it for surfing the web, I bought a tablet but the time it took to load a page compared to a laptop was way too long. The main reason I bought this laptop was for the 1080p screen, personally I think it looks great, and you cant find another laptop at a comparable price to this with the same resolution screen. The physical laptop itself is very pleasing to the eyes and feels well built.I re installed a vanilla version of windows as soon as I got it, even though there appeared to be little or no bloatware on the system. It  feels faster with the fresh version of windows, but that may be all in my imagination.Battery Life seems to be ~3 hours, which is alright for me, most of my computing is done from the comfort of my own home, but I can see how this could be a problem.The wireless connects almost instantly. Actually windows starts up in about 6 seconds after the bios is posted, which is extremely fast, I guess that SSD is doing its job.The only part that doesnt work quite as well as I think it should is the mouse, all though it seems to work alot better after I re installed windows, but I may have just gotten used to its quirks. The main thing you have to remember is that the whole thing is a mouse, so when you go to click with your left hand while scrolling with your right hand, the mouse may jump around the screen. With some practice and more delicate movements, this mouse seems to do its job well...

Even 5 years ago when I had a extremely heavy Acer laptop that got 3 hours, so the fact that this new laptop with lower power-consuming technologies cannot achieve 3 hours is bad.

IS FINEKeyboard - Would be better if have back-light, and i don't figure it how o do the ascents vocals and ~n. BUT IS OK I THINKCharger - the way that pluged, is a little uncomfortable becouse doesn't go straight way that you connect on pc, the cable must be parallel to the side of pc, is difficult not to folded.

I do like the thinness, resolution and the light weight.  I don't like the spastic touch pad.  The cursor goes all over the place. It takes twice as long to write this message because I keep having to go back and adjust the cursor.  At times the cusor also sticks and it takes several minutes for it to start working again.  A lot of patients is required for this computor.  Also, when I set up the computer there were no instructions to register it.  Nor were there any in the sparce booklet.  So, I don't know if it will be covered if I need warranty work or who to call or where to send it.  And, I miss the num pad and keys to the right of the key board.
