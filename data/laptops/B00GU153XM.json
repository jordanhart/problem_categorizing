As far as ratings let's get into it by listing the Pros and Cons**List of Pros**Gaming performance 4/5So far one the games I've tried, this machine has performed like a champ. No real complaints here. Also, considering I'm upgrading from a 5 year old laptop, this machine is greater than anything I have ever experienced.Battery life 3/5I guess this could be both a pro and a con for this laptop as the time that the battery lasts really depends on what you are doing at the time. If you are just doing schoolwork, the battery could potentially last up to 4 hours. If you are playing games, it will last about an hour at the most. Still, this is much better than my previous laptop so big points for that.Camera 4/5The 720p camera on this laptop is decent, but much better than what I am used to. The images are grainy, however the is no lag on the camera. I guess for most people this might me a problem, but it is good enough for me.Windows 8.1 4/5I think windows 8.1 is one of those things that can be considered both a pro and a con. There are a lot of things I miss about windows 7, but let's face it, Windows 8.1 is much more efficient at both gaming and energy consumption. However, I hate that damned Metro interface, especially since this isn't a touchscreen computer.\"Ultrabay\" ??/5I know this is definitely a pro, but it seems that Lenovo isn't really offering readily accessible Ultrabay accessories so i'm not 100% sure if i'll be able to add another graphics card or not. As you know, this computer, the y410p comes with an optical bay drive in the computer instead of the second graphics card. I am not sure how much this will affect gaming performance but I guess i'll find out soon.Keyboard 5/5The keyboard is definitely a strong point on this laptop. It feels very responsive and tactile for both gaming and typing in general. However, in my experience, while gaming it tends to get a little hot over the WASD keys which kind of makes it undesirable to use during gaming. The back-light is configurable to have two levels of brightness in a red lava color. I haven't had it out in public, but i'm pretty sure it would stand out. Overall, it's a very strong keyboard.Ports 5/5I am SO glad that Lenovo decided to include so many different kinds of ports on this laptop. Three USB ports (one 3.0), HDMI, VGA, Ethernet (missing on most slimmer laptops nowadays), Audio and microphone jacks, 1 Kensington Lock, and 1 SD/MMC/MsPro Card slot.**List of Cons**Build Quality 2/5Casing / BodyUpon receiving this laptop, I was surprised at the low quality of the overall build. The lid as well as the bottom are both made out carbon-fiber, which,to the touch actually feels quite durable, but I guess we'll see how it holds up the first time I drop it.The thing that stands out to me the most and probably is the most undesirable thing about the aluminium palm rest is the seemingly jagged, abrasive ridge that hurts your wrist if you slide your hand over the edge of the laptop. On my previous laptop, a nicely built Sony Vaio, the ridge was smooth to the touch and your wrist or hand could just slide off the laptop naturally. However, on this laptop it goes from smooth aluminium to jagged edge really quickly.Sound 4/5The speakers on this laptop are louder than any I've ever tried. But, once again, that might not be the best thing, as loudness doesn't always translate into quality. I've found that when I play certain song at max volume it actually makes the speakers wobble creating a distorted sound and basically ruining the sound quality of the song. A perfect example of this is the song \"Years\" by Alesso. When it plays the first part of the song, the piano part, you can hear the wobble distortion sound, ruining the first part of the song. Now, I've noticed that maybe ~75% songs are able to play without distortion at max volume so I can't take too many points off, but it is something to be aware of.TouchPad 2/5The touch-pad on this laptop is probably one of the worst touch-pads I have ever used on a laptop. However, if you are going to do any serious gaming or media editing, you'll probably be using a mouse so this is a moot point. However, for just general use laying in your bed or something, I found the touch-pad a pain to use. The material that they used seems to be some kind of matte plastic instead going with my personal favorite -- frosted glass -- which was used on my Sony Vaio. I have heard that you can download drivers from Synaptics website to make the TP work better, but I have not yet tried this.Weight 3/5This laptop is definitely on the heavier side, although not too heavy where it's going to break your back or something. IT weighs 4.8 pounds without SLI and without the power brick and 5.5 with the power brick.Verdict 3/5All in all, for the price I paid $819 + $59 tax so $879 (bought it directly from Lenovo's website), there is simply no laptop that I could find that squeezes more parts, ports, etc into a gaming laptop for around that price. So this is definitely a good deal for the money, and it blows my previous laptop out of the water, but the various design flaws like the sharp edges, sometimes faulty speakers, and below average touch-pad bring the overall score down. About the edges, I am considering calling Lenovo and asking about whether I can get it replaced for a laptop that doesn't have that issue, as I could probably live with the other shortcomings.***EDIT***I ended up calling lenovo and returning this laptop after finding out that the edges are apparently a design flaw and both the y410p and the y510p have that problem. I ended up going with the GIGABYTE P34Gv2-CF1 14\" Gaming Notebook which is much more expensive but also a lot slimmer and has better build quality. In the end, I picked quality over price.", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Quality refurbished product at a stellar price", "Author": "Michael P Jones", "ReviewID": "R3UO1PPCH8DGOU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this for over a month and it's been fantastic. The laptop is practically brand new despite being refurbished. High quality for the price.", "Date": "May 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "An excellent gaming laptop for its price", "Author": "Kite Edmonds", "ReviewID": "R21N4DLYGVLTAS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, this particular configuration code (59399853) for the y410p is the one that comes with some key upgrades and one downgrade over other y410p configurations.The first is that it includes a 24GB M.2 SSD which is used for caching, and after a few reboots makes the boot up time very fast, less than 10 seconds from power to desktop.Second is that this particular configuration includes an Intel 7260 wireless card instead of the 2200 series centrino on the other models. It's an excellent performing adapter but only capable of 2.4GHz which is one of the only drawbacks of this laptop overall.Third is that this configuration code includes the 1600x900 LCD instead of the 1366x768 that the cheapest variety of y410p includes. While the screen is sharper and better it's still of a pretty low quality overall. It's a glossy TN panel with poor vertical angles.The downgrade would be that this model includes a 62 Watt hour battery while some other configurations come with a 72 Watt hour battery, making a system that already has pretty short battery life even shorter.Now on to the meat of things.First the CPU in this (i7 4700MQ) is one of the fastest mobile processors you can get, only the i7 with the 128megs of onboard cache for the iris graphics is better. The graphics adapter is also excellent, the Geforce 755m can handle most games at the resolution this laptop runs at at middle or high graphic settings.However, there is a problem. This laptop is pretty small and light, and between the CPU and the GPU the TDPs combine to hit 95 watts (45watt CPU, 50watt GPU), which is a LOT of possible heat to dissipate in such a small chassis. In addition both adapters share the same single cooling fan and vent.Temperatures of the CPU under normal use hover in the 60\u00b0C range.If this laptop had a higher quality TN LCD or (even better) a decent IPS display and a bit more venting for heat dissipation I'd give it five stars. As it is if you're an expert and don't have a problem with possibly having to open a laptop up and applying a better thermal transfer material (like arctic silver) between the heatsink and the CPU and GPU to help lessen the thermal throttling then this laptop is a great deal.For anyone else it's still a good deal at the price, but might end up with a lot of thermal throttling.Some additional thoughts on the unit after a bit of use:First the touch-pad is not ideal, it's probably the laptop's single least desirable part. It tracks motion fine and as far as touch-pads that don't have discreet buttons but instead have click-able corners it's pretty good, but touch-pads with buttons are always more desirable than this type. If you're planning to use a mouse with the unit (as many gamers would) then it's not relevant.Second the keyboard, it's very attractive thanks to the red backlight, and if you like a keyboard with a bit of tactile feedback and a long key travel this one might be the best I've ever used. For anyone used to the normally mushy unresponsive kind of laptop keyboard with almost no key travel this one might seem a bit weird at first because it's just not what one is normally used to, but once you're used to it I think most people would agree it's pretty good.Lenovo ships their laptops with fast reboot software that can interfere with Norton 360 to some degree and cause it to throw errors after reboots. Either you can do a full format and load of windows to resolve it or use something other than Norton.", "Date": "June 5, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GU153XM"}}
