I made it to retirement and felt I deserved a state of the art toy. I swore I would never again be chained to a desk, but still wanted a screen large enough I could read from it without my glasses. My Studio with its 8 gigs of ram (probably overkill) sails through the graphics on all the naval and railroad simulations that really put the hurt on other machines I've owned or used. I once swore by MacIntosh but, owning one and working with them in schools for years, I found reliability wise, they burned a lot of drives and crashed more often than anything except a PC running Windows ME. For a time they sure used top quality plastic which might be one of the reasons they cost so much. Following the advice of a computer teacher, I switched over to Dell for home. I could use it not only as a workhorse, but I could play games with it. I would leave it on for weeks at a time. Since then our family has destroyed two expensive HP laptops, and I have an IBM on the ropes. The old 2001 Dell still works as does a five year old 15\" Inspiron, a four year old e1705, a disposable Latitude bought for an emergency which ran so well I decided to keep it and still use it. All our Dells have their original keys and all continue to be reliable. So purchasing the Studio with its fast i7 processor was easy to justify. I opted for slightly better graphics instead of the touch screen. After wiping off my iPod Touch countless times each day, I am glad I have no reason to smear the Studio's screen. I like the back-lit keys, their smooth, quiet operation, and the numeric keypad. I've seen other brands rise and fall in quality and reliability over the years, but hope this Dell Studio lives up to the standards my older Dells have set. I am not quite ready to submit it to the drop test all our other Dell laptops have survived.", "Date": "September 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Computer", "Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "R1BBPCKKE1PMUM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've used this computer for years, and I love it. I'm incredibly tech savvy, and I know what makes a good machine.

Swarvar", "ReviewID": "RHQU8RI7B1LNL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I honestly don't know why the other reviewers were having issues with this laptop, I have a similar 1747 and it has surpassed all my expectations (which are pretty high since I'm in the IT industry and am exposed to PC's, networks, servers, etc all day long every day).  My co worker also has this same laptop after hearing me rave about mine and checking it out for himself.  We both travel a lot and our laptops have held up flawlessly.First, the battery lasts HOURS (mine is the 9 cell, not the 6).  The sound on it is fantastic with the dual speakers and subwoofer built in, plus it has 2 spots for headphones if more than 1 person wants to watch a movie.  Mine has a blu ray player as well with HDMI out so it makes traveling and watching movies a pleasurable experience.  I added bluetooth myself (cheap and easy) and plan to add the backlit keyboard (not options when I bought it).  The i7 is flat out spectacular on this machine.  The graphics card is great for mobile gaming as well.  I have no issues or complaints, it really is head and shoulders better than anything else I have seen in that department.  I also like the fact that it has an eSata port and an extra hard drive bay so I can add another drive when I want (which I will be doing soon).  I really can't say enough good things about it.Downsides?  Of course there are a couple.  It's big and heavy...but that doesn't bother me, I knew it was big and heavy when I bought it (it is a 17\" laptop after all...you want light and small, you shouldn't be looking at a 17\" laptop).  The 9 cell battery also hangs down and is not comfortable to rest on your legs for very long.  I am thinking about getting a 6 cell battery, which is flat to resolve that issue.  Last down side that I can think of is the lack of USB ports.  They are not positioned very well (on the right side of the machine) and there are only 2 of them.Overall I find this to be a quality laptop with fantastic performance.  You also get a LOT of bang for your buck with this machine.  Buy it, live with it, be happy as long as you understand it's weight and size.  Really consider if this machine is for you - if you want horsepower and a big screen, look no further.  If you want something light and/or small or don't care about gaming and performance, look elsewhere - this isn't the machine for you.", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Solid performance and great support from Dell.", "Author": "S.

I've called Dell technical support a few times with questions and always received fast answers from a knowledgeable and clear technician.I am very happy with this computer and strongly recommend it.  It looks great, especially the screen.  The sound is very strong and crisp.  The design and manufacturing are very solid.", "Date": "November 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Slight disappointment", "Author": "James L Cannon \"Jim Cannon\"", "ReviewID": "R79RF5957Y04I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was slightly disappointed that a machine of this class did not have more USB ports and none on the video port side of the machine.  This means it is hard to put it on a modern USB KVM.  Also was sad that it does not have built in Bluetooth.  Overall it performs well enough,  however it is my wife's computer and she does not stress a box.  Gave the same computer to my grandson and it failed after two weeks.  Dell replaced the disk drive promptly but I don't think that a computer that is as high performance as this should use components that would fail this quickly.  Obviously low QC and no burn in.

However, After being on for about 4 hours one day it would load web pages very slowly,and about an hour after that I was flashed with a blue screen before the laptop automatically shut down. I'm slightly more computer proficient than the average person so I was able to ascertain that the cause was an overheat, and that it was not uncommon for this particular laptop.

This studio laptop (which i've had over 1 yr) turns off randomly (likely an overheating issue).

It does get really f'n hot and the mouse pad sticks but then again I have been using desktops for a while so that might not matter yet. Though I've read a bunch of horror stories on Dells and their service track, hopefully no problems.
