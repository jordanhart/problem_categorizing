The mouse and touchpadcontrols do not function properly. One recurring problem is that the left click button will trigger itself without warning causing everything the cursor passes over to be clicked on. When typing this report the mouse left click button fired many times causing the text cursor to jump to another position. Sometimes this required me to stop, delete and retype. Other times it deleted entire lines of text. Very frustrating.", "Date": "May 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "both seller and product excellent", "Author": "chaydel", "ReviewID": "RRDYPYMCITL5S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Seller Link-tronics shipped same day of order and also answered a pre-sale question very promptly. The laptop was packaged securely. I would definitely order from them again.The Dell E6400 looks new; which I didn't really expect, so that's a bonus. The specs are exactly as were stated in the description. Boots up fast and no bloatware. No barrage of pop up windows and marketing yap to get rid of. Comes with Open Office. All Windows Updates were installed, and I was able to use the machine right out of the box. For my purposes, it is an excellent buy. I use this to type and surf on. I do not play hardware intensive games, so cannot speak to that aspect.", "Date": "February 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "met my needs", "Author": "Margie J.
