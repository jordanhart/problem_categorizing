{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very sturdy laptop.", "Author": "J. Ross", "ReviewID": "R1PIXAAVWJF4YP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop to replace a very lightweight Sony that had ran Vista and was starting to have issues, both with the software and the hardware (keyboard starting to act up). This Windows 7 Laptop is heavier but seems very well built.  I think I saw something about being built to military standards for durability standards (I could be wrong on this), but it seems as it very well could have been.  As it is now discontinued, I got it at a tremendous bargain, $600 versus $1200. I love the Windows 7 operating system and it's speed and ease of upgrading.  I upgraded memory from 4GB to 8GB for $33 from HP.  Very pleased with this laptop, no regrets. I bought it to use primarily as a business tool with client presentations.", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005GIZO52"}}
