I'm upgrading from windows XP and enjoying learning Windows 8 with \"Teach Yourself Visually Windows\". If you need to do something quickly you can toggle back to desktop view. It has everything I was looking for: a touch screen with great resolution, 2.4GHz ,8GB RAM, 1TB Hard Drive, DVD burner, Multimedia Card Slot, 4 USB 3.0 ports and a Webcam. The vendor also was great to work with. The first laptop I received had a problem with the touch screen and they shipped a replacement the next day. I would definitely recommend this laptop.", "Date": "February 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Slower than I thought it should be", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3Q00QM1SCCPLN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I expected lightening fast start up and response with an intel i7 processor, but I can't tell any difference from the i5 that I had earlier.  I am disappointed since this computer cost twice as much as the i5. Maybe all that preloaded software slows things down.
