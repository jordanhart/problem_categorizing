One for a friend and one for myself. My friend received his laptop and is very happy with it. The Dell laptop I have is working beautifully. I bought it used and it does have a few scratches but that is not so important. It came with Windows 7 installed and all of the components work. I connected the Wi-Fi to my home computer and it works anywhere in the house and in a free Wi-Fi environment. The laptop stars up quickly and runs fast. It has a DVD disc player and I can watch movies that I have on DVD disc. The only drawback that I discovered thus far is when I tried to download a movie to a flash drive and play the movie from the flash drive. This did not work. If you only want to watch movies from a flash drive you will have to find software on the internet to enable this action.This is an economical alternative to expensive laptops. My friend has and ipad that she can only use in her house or a Wi-Fi environment just like this laptop. She wants to print some of the pictures that she took and she can't because the ipad does not have a USB port to connect to a printer.

It arrived, and I was able to test and assure my satisfaction. Then they sent a mail label pre-paid for the return of the first item.During this complete process, they were always immediate to respond to me y questions.
