The Intel i5 is really fast and the battery life is better than average I would say. I have to agree on the other reviewer on the audio. It is better than all my laptops I ever had! It is very clear and it is really great when watching Netflix, playing video games, and especially listening to music.The laptop does not have a dedicated graphics card which is a bummer but the Intel HD 3000 graphics card can play all my steam games well and a couple games include: Portal 2, team fortress 2, Just cause 2, and even the new counter strike, which may say looks great! I can get about 2.5 to 3 hours of gaming on this laptop which is above average for gaming. I did not buy this laptop for gaming cause I already have a rig that can do it all.The performance on this thing is great! I like how the machine has office and outlook starter installed cause as a high school student I don't have to worry about buying Microsoft office. Every program opens up quickly and makes my life easier.Also I like the red backlit keyboard which adds a more value look to it and I must say the red makes it look more beautiful than a white light for the keyboard.I get about 4 hours of watching HD movies on this machine and the beats audio makes it enjoyable!This laptop was well worth the money I paid for and if you have any questions ask away!", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Some key features", "Author": "sirak", "ReviewID": "R2UMEAPFU2352Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a nice looking laptop but there are some key features that are not described above.Bluetooth with WiDi (for wireless connection to HDTV)Beats Audio with 2 speakers and a subwooferFull-size red (back-lit) keyboardHP Imagepad with on/off button and precision multi-touch gesture support.Digital media card reader for Secure Digital and Multimedia cards2 SuperSpeed USB 3.0  (new technology)1 HDMI  (for wired connection to HDTV)I hope this helps people decide if they want this laptop.", "Date": "October 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't buy without extended warranty", "Author": "ohiogreg", "ReviewID": "R1UZ7HN94O2D7D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Make sure you buy an extended warranty with this computer. My screen went bad in just 14 months. HPs computers have been going down hill over the years.", "Date": "October 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Liked it until it started breaking for no reason except poor quality.", "Author": "stryder", "ReviewID": "RIVYPRDTJAVSS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I opened my six month old HP today to use it and much to my surprise it had a large black blotch in the screen. I never dropped it. I didn't close it with anything in between it. I did NOTHING out of the ordinary - I simply plugged it in last night to recharge it and then reopened it this afternoon to use it again.Then I called HP tech support and this time, unlike the broken trackpad they already replaced and it wasn't too bad an experience, this time has been a complete nightmare. All of these so called support people are in India to begin with and they have no method to pull up your records by your phone number. Why? Instead they make you take the battery out and look up your serial and model numbers. Ok, fair enough, I can do this once. Then the technician told me they would send someone over to look at the screen and replace it at their cost but that I would have to pay for the technician's visit at a cost of $139. Then the call went dead. So I called back and of course had to go through the entire process again. This person said the same thing and I said it was unacceptable that I would have to pay for a service call when I did nothing wrong and that I'd rather just send it back in yet again and let them fix it, like I'd already done with the trackpad that broke. At that point I was told they would have to transfer my call to another department that would give me my options in getting it fixed, which led me to believe that I would be transferred back to the USA to finalize everything. Nope. Another call to India or Pakistan or wherever they source their support and guess what? I have to give them ALL the info yet again for the third time and start at square one again. This time they take all the info down and the tech tells me he would have to transfer me to his supervisor to let me know how the repairs would be handled. A lady comes on the line who says she's level two support (still offshore) and she informs me that screen issues are not covered by warranty and I would have to pay $349 to get it fixed!?! I told her that the first two techs had told me $139 to send a repair tech to my place and that HP would pay for the screen. She said she knew nothing about that or who told me that and assured me it would cost me $349 to fix. Her attitude was if it's a screen problem we don't cover it and there is no such thing as a defective screen. I told her that was unacceptable as it would HAVE to be a defective screen, given how it went bad on its own without any wrong doing or accident on my part. At that point she said I can assure you it was not defective and if you want it fixed you will have to call back and spend $349 to fix it! This is a six month old computer folks and all I did was open it to use it and was confronted with the black blotch on the screen. NEVER AGAIN with HP! NEVER AGAIN. And to think I actually recommended this!", "Date": "September 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "STAY AWAY FROM HP", "Author": "DJ", "ReviewID": "R3A6PLEB8B88V1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I AM A EXPERIENCED DJ....WORKING WITH A ASUS LAPTOP WANTED A BACK UP THOUGHT I WOULD TRY AN HP.BAD IDEA,LOADED  ALL MY MUSIC (VIVA) FLASH DRIVE.
