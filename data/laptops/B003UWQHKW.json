The fast hard drive as well as the dedicated video card works great for that purpose.As a refirb unit I must say that it arrived in perfect condition, well packaged and complete it its' minimal accessories. It show no evidence of being used .. ever. The lid is attractive and seems solidly made. It's not particularly fancy, but it has solid specs and seems like a good performer. Much, much better than my defective HP dv9910 that died an early death.What I like most:Overall Speed and video.Fast 7200 RPM DriveDecent processor speedDedicated video with 1GB of dedicated RAMQuick boot timeRubberized palm rest - no fingerprints.Lighted keyboard.Very good speakers.Very good venting and cooling. Look at it on Circuit City website. Good photos.Nice screen (Not HD)2nd drive bay availableReasonable number of ports & connectionsMinimal bloatware.Well packaged for shipping.The Bad: Very short battery life (1 Hr). Minimal 3 Month Warranty as a refirb.This unit can generate some heat on AC. I bought a Targus cooling mat for it just to be safe.In all I am satisfied. It meets my needs very nicely. If you are nervous about a refirb, relax, give it a shot.Good value at $619 if it lasts. Only time will tell ...", "Date": "January 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great gaming computer", "Author": "E. S. Rutledge", "ReviewID": "R2YMKU8BERNFLK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Probably a bit late for this review as we bought this Christmas 1010. The computer runs great, has had no problems, has played all the games he likes that takes lots of memory and a good graphics card. The only consideration is that the battery only lasts about an hour  or so, depending on what you do. The keys have an underlight and there is a great lighted design on the front. Wonderful picture. I own one of these too which is why they wanted one and am writing this review on it. I also own an Asus Netbook with Windows XP on it. I bought an external drive to load games, an extra gig of memory and I can hook it up to my TV and play older games on it. Love both of them.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "GREAT LAPTOP", "Author": "Diego", "ReviewID": "R1IFPYNATL7ERX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop Refurbished.
