Though I've had it only a few days, processing seems smooth, graphics are solid, overall function is great.As of yet, there has been no power lag on any pages or programs.I haven't tried out the DVD drive yet.  I also haven't tried to run Netflix on the computer in an HD stream.  Will update when those events happen.So far, my only gripe is that 1) I managed to get a little coffee on it so far (still runs great though), and 2) sadly, this may become my main computer, as it seems to be better performing than my desktop at this stage.I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a solid second computer for school, some business, or recreation.  I'm sure there are better units out there, but for the money, this is an awesome investment.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not very durable", "Author": "Enoch", "ReviewID": "R1N9IXE8QIA2KV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased two Toshiba Satellites model C655 August 2011.

This laptop is plenty capable for what I and likely 95% of the population use computers for, day to day internet use, Itunes, Facebook, etc. The speakers are decent and the webcam is good for those that like to Skype. My three Toshiba laptops over the last 6 years were still cheaper than any Macbook Pro.

I only used the computer about 1/2 hour a day at most. Toshiba made it difficult and charges $25 to fix the problem, in addition to not having a computer for 2-3 weeks. I realize problems occur with computers, but I would appreaciate more flexibility with their customer service when a major internal issue occers within 1 month of owning the computer. Will not buy another Toshiba product.", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Better than a netbook, worse than decent laptops", "Author": "Mrhu3y", "ReviewID": "R50XMHWZW023Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this laptop since 2010 with the intent for use in college. But throughout the years of transferring schools and staying up late to study or do homework, this laptop has both meant a lot to me but has also been a curse.Outside the classroom:I wouldn't want use this laptop as my main computer; it has a rather small hard drive and the RAM, CPU, and video card are terrible by today's standards. I wish I could take out the hardware components that are installed now and put in my own but unfortunately that's not how laptops work. I do recommend though to upgrade the RAM on this computer; many times the computer will freeze up during watching Youtube with 2 Microsoft docs open while chatting on Facebook. I went ahead and upgraded to 8gb just because why not? Aside from that, this computer runs relatively well for homework and practical internet use. I have gamed CS 1.6, Xcom, and Mass Effect 2 on this computer at medium to low settings but I'd stay away from trying to play higher performing games or more demanding settings on this laptop. As for the hard drive space, I haven't run into many problems because I intended this laptop for work and school, not gaming.In Classroom use:As a student who has been taking this laptop to class more often to take notes, it can be a literal pain in the neck to carry; although 5 lbs doesn't sound like a lot, try walking around 3-5 miles a day with that on your back. Aside from that, my battery lasts about 3 hours unplugged on the lowest brightness settings and in the \"power saver\" mode. The specs say 5 hours but I'm getting 3 hours of battery life now because it's the same stock battery from almost 3 years ago when I got the laptop. The processor is somewhat loud; its fan makes a constant whirring sound that can be a bit annoying --but I've gotten use to it.Overall:It's a good laptop if you don't expect to do a lot but I would still highly recommend at least upgrading the RAM. I've dropped this laptop many times and it's still running the way it was designed. The case is missing a few screws from over the few years of use and abuse but it's still holding on.", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Toshiba .... Great as always", "Author": "J.

I am very happy I chose this one, the Toshiba - Satellite C655-S5212 Intel Core i3 Processor. It has a webcam, microphone, and SD card reader as well as DVD and CD RW drive, it also came with Windows 7 that is very easy to use if you are not familiar with it. The laptop itself is a good weight so it does not feel cheap like others. The screen is a great size and it has very nice features. I am still learning all of the extras it has to offer and how the mouse pad works (like making the text larger or smaller with the simple touch of a left and right finger)I love it so much that I am recommending this laptop especially for the LOW price of only $497.00 and FREE shipping and fast delivery.", "Date": "September 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Never buy a Toshiba Laptop", "Author": "Aran Joseph Canes", "ReviewID": "R2CPXSBDD8ZHUO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Never buy a Toshiba laptop.  After three months the screen displayed horizontal lines without being dropped or damaged.  When I spoke to Toshiba I was hung up on twice and then told to speak to the place where I bought the computer.  Finally I spoke to the customer service manager who informed me that the warranty didn't cover damage to the monitor even if the damage was not the fault of the owner.  To say the least I'm very dissatisifed with the way Toshiba deals with its customers post purchase and the quality of a computer which would break after three months for no particular reason.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Another Great Toshiba computer", "Author": "Michal L. Jones \"geomason\"", "ReviewID": "RXD4EAK722MY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had decided when my laptop died suddenly that I would get either a Toshiba or HP to replace it.  I bought a HP locally with Windows 8.  It isn't intuitive  on first blush, but has some great features (although this isn't about Windows operating systems, my decision to buy this particular laptop was based on it's Windows 7 operating system.  My problem with Windows 8 is that it will not allow POP type email accounts to be set up.  This was totally unacceptable as I use the laptop for both work and home emails, which are POP accounts, PLUS everything has to go thru Microsoft, all software etc.  The 'run around' to this is \"forward\" all your email through the Microsoft email account.  So I returned that machine.  This particular model is at least 3 years old, but the speed, RAM and Hard Drive capacity are great!  The keyboard has good action and the separate number pad an added bonus I hadn't anticipated.  It boots up within seconds and ready to \"run\" immediately.  The screen has good resolution.  I do have a minor problem with the sound system as it's difficult to moderate and at full volume isn't loud enough depending on the program, but that is a minor problem.  I'd have liked to get an ultra-light, but also needed the optical drive for work along with the video port.  It comes with 2 usb ports, would have liked a third, but again not a deal breaker.  But it is light enough I don't mind the extra weight.  This is my second Toshiba and I hope it gives me the same great service the first one did.", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cheap Flimsy Design", "Author": "Robert Fox", "ReviewID": "R5LWDLZ43DH5H", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The hinge on the left hand side binds, and has caused the body of the laptop to separate.
