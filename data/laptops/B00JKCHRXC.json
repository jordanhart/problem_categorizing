My requirements were,1. be able to drive 3 monitors.2. plenty of room for storage3. function as a desktop replacement for work and gamingPros:- The price is good, and the laptop is thin and surprisingly light. I think they list it at about 5.8lbs and I'd say it's more or less around 6lbs.- MSI includes 1 year accidental damage warranty if you register within 30 days. As a road warrior I find this invaluable.- It can drive 3 monitors. HOWEVER: if you use Mini display port to HDMI adapters one of those adapters must be an ACTIVE adapter. I purchased 2 PNY mini displayport to hdmi adapters and had to return one for an Accel active adapter. This is no where in the documentation or on the forums. I had to call MSI support to find this out. If you use a mini displayport to VGA adapter that is an Active adapter.- Storage expandable with 2 mSata and 1 2.5\" 9mm drive bay. This machine came with 1 - 128gb SSD and 1 750GB Western digital. I added in a Samsung 840 Evo SSD and made my boot drive RAID 0 (more for conveneince than speed). This is a huge win over the similarly spec'd Alienware which costs about $600 more and only comes with a 128gb SSD.- 4 USB portscons- I don't like that the air intake is above the keyboard, meaning when I put this on my desk and connect all external monitors, I have to leave the laptop open so it can suck air in. I really don't like this at all as it renders all cooling pads as useless (except to keep it from cooking your lap). Exhaust is on either side of the laptop so keep those areas open.- Some people complain about the noise but honestly, if you're used to a big powerhouse desktop this is quiet in comparison. I actually have mine set off to the side and just run all the cables to my desk.- The touchpad is not very responsive imo I didn't fiddle with it much because I always have a logitech anywhere mouse with me. I hate touchpads in general so I think they all suck equally.- SD Cards stick out of the slot way too much. maybe 1/4 of an inch. I would prefer a flush fitting slot so i could leave in a 128GB SD card for extra storage.- Supports 3 external screens but unlike the Aorus X7 it does not support Nvidia Surround. I was sad to learn I couldn't do the 3 monitor gaming with this laptop but once I get my Oculus Rift Dev2 it won't matter much any more. Otherwise I'll pick up a matrix multihead2goPeople have complained about temperatures and while I saw some high numbers at times they weren't much higher than my desktop (Saints Row IV at ultra settings peak temps were around 86 degrees.)I really like the laptop and while it's only been a couple of weeks, I have almost seamlessly moved on from my desktop to this laptop, and now that Steam has streaming I don't think that my laptop's GPU will hold me back in the future. I plan to replace the WD Storage drive with a 1TB SSD once the prices come down a bit and hopefully get some work done when I'm not gaming.Let me know if you have any questions on the laptop i'll try to answer.", "Date": "May 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "If you are looking for a slim, light, affordable, powerful-when-you-need-it laptop, this is it.", "Author": "P.M.", "ReviewID": "R1M4RZJYMRG4YQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, let me say that I am very pleased with this laptop. The build quality is excellent given the cost and the components within. Negative comments seem to expect a $2000+ build for the $1599 they are paying. If you are considering this laptop, you will be unhappy if you COULD afford a more expensive laptop but went for this one, and you will be unhappy if you DO NOT value the slim build or low weight.Let me say that another way: This laptop does NOT have as nice a build as more expensive, new, slim gaming laptops that cost $400+ more for the same internals, and if that is important for you, do not buy this laptop. The build quality is EXCELLENT, but if they put another $400 into it, it would be better. This laptop does NOT have anything going for it that explains the $400+ premium you are paying for it if you are going to sit it on a desk, closed, and hook monitors, keyboard, and mouse into it and use it as a desktop replacement, and if that is your plan, do not buy this laptop.With this laptop you really do get an excellent combination machine, a hybrid of high-quality sleek fashionable build formerly found only with extremely weak internals that prohibit any sort of real gaming, with an extremely capable performer fully able to handle today's games. The speed and capability of this laptop more than takes care of everything I throw at it. The reviews are out there, go look at them to see if a GTX860 is enough for your needs, because if you at all care about the size and portability of your laptop, you won't be doing any better for the price.Please send me questions, I would love to answer them for you. I am very happy with this laptop, my wife likes it (looks good sitting on a table, actually competes with her MacBook pro as far as looks are concerned, and she is really pleased I went for this slimmer build vs. something almost 2 inches tall and 9 lbs heavy) and I could not have gotten a laptop that better served my needs for this price.", "Date": "June 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Do not waste your money", "Author": "Jack", "ReviewID": "RS7JA233SZKX6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This thing seems to be a good laptop and appears to look nice.Cons:Lets start with the Screen Panel the edges are sharp. the panel looks as if it was made in the 90's as the border is huge.The Mouse pad is useless as it does not want to track properly and continually jumps all over the place.The mouse pad is off centered to the keyboard so it gets in the way.The keyboard it self is not centered so the space bar is not centered in the keyboard.Can't turn off the color scheme on the keyboard.Pro:It is fast with the ssd as the os drive. and the quad core I7If I had seen this prior to purchase I would not have spent the money, if I could I would return to Amazon as soon as I could.", "Date": "June 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fast and Flexible", "Author": "D R Malenchek", "ReviewID": "R31DST6DKZ1D97", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "bought it for my son as a graduation present and he couldn't stop raving about it.
