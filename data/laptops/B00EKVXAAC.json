I got this computer and love it!  For the price I paid, it's such a steal.  The screen is huge and it's not heavy at all. The sound is pretty good and the keyboard is very functional.  I like that it has a DVD/CD burner, a built in web camera and so far, it hasn't frozen on me at all.  It shuts off and on how it's supposed to and there's no complaints I can really make about it since my time of purchase.Windows 8 could take some getting used to, but that has nothing to do with the physicality of the computer itself.  I usually own desktops and have had an apple laptop so this is my second laptop purchase.  It's been a very smooth transition with using this computer.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "good desktop replacement", "Author": "outlaw164 \"webmaster\"", "ReviewID": "R393R0ODWZ3RSJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Only reason I bought this laptop, from a different merchant, was to replace my HP business class 17\" laptop running Windows XP Pro. Since Microsoft won't be supporting XP after April 8, 2014 I figured now was the time to pull the trigger on a new one by taking advantage of after-Christmas overstock price reductions.I also own a Dell Alienware desktop running Windows 7 Pro, so the leap to Windows 8 wasn't all that dramatic on this HP Pavilion. Yes, there are certain features on Win 8 that I don't care for, but it's not a deal breaker. After all, Win 8 and its successors are here to stay for the future, so better pony up to change and get used to it.Installing the free Windows 8.1 upgrade was a plus. Start button is back, sort of, just not the familiar Start that Vista and Win 7 users are used to. Had to hunt for the Jump Lists. Haven't created a shortcut for them yet. Comes loaded with a ton of apps I'll likely not use, only a few useful ones that interest me.Nice bright screen and decent sound. Color rendition is a bit lacking in the saturation department. Color calibration doesn't help much. If I were a student I'd better hit the gym and lift weights. Wouldn't cherish lugging this hefty rascal from class to class.All in all, I'm satisfied with its performance. Plenty fast with enough horsepower to do what I want with a portable PC. Only use it when away from home on business and pleasure. I became very spoiled with my older HP 17\", so I just had to jump on this one.

My old standby computer, I think I have had for almost 10 years now. And would gladly still be doing everything on it If Microsoft had not killed Windows XP. But I couldn't very well stuff it in a bag and go either.  So at least this lets me take it on a trip.What I do like so far: Graphics look nice.  I listened to a little music on it and was pleased with the quality of the speakers.  Surprisingly clear. Didn't sound tinny.  The screen is large with good picture quality.  However, it is bright!  If you are one of those people who has trouble with going to sleep after watching TV or computing, I strongly suggest a pair of the yellow glasses (blue-blockers).As I learn my way around it I find I am starting to like the way it works.  I would give it 5 stars if it were not for the internal mouse.  I found it to be too touchy.  I would recommend using an external.  I am using a Logitech 3M10 instead of the built in mouse at this time and find it much easier for my personal use.  One thing I did like about the built in mouse was how easy it is to pan in and out on the screen.Overall, I find I am really liking this computer.  If I so wished, I could replace my old desktop with it.  I sometimes have to laugh at myself for the things I have overlooked.For instance; It does have an HDMI connection for hooking up to a television.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Price", "Author": "Adrian Castro Furniss", "ReviewID": "R32HTQ64HYRIC4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great Service and price, the computer arrived safely, big screen, all for a low price with great potential, excellent buy", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "I am sick of talking to hp support!!!", "Author": "gloria kohnen \"Ggk\"", "ReviewID": "R2H8FCYT2AVJ2U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this from micro center because I had purchased another computer from amazon and had to send it back because of a personal preference issue and I did not want to be stuck with a postage charge again.I have the same issue of the computer not shutting down and having to hold the power button for an extended time to shut the machine down.

Before I got my stay-at-home job, I had a very nice Toshiba laptop, which one of the USB ports went bad. With only 2 USB ports, and only one working, I know I would dare to try to talk with Toshibas Support Group, I thought it was time for a new laptop. I did some searching and this one seemed to be the best. So, I purchased it.In the two days it took to get here (Thanks Amazon Prime!), I broke out the old solder gun and successfully fixed the USB on my other laptop. Now, without a factory solder, it's probably a little (or A LOT) more fragile -- long story short, I now use that laptop more as a desktop. Enough story telling...I got the package and I'm very happy! It's over a great, fast, beautiful, laptop that I actually like better than my (sorry Steve Jobs) MacBook.Hmmm, why the two star rating?Exactly a month and four days after I bought it, I was booting up, and noticed a bright, blue dot. Stuck pixel, huh?! I tried every method to fix it, but it just won't go away.I'm normally not that picky, and it's only one pixel, but when my whole screen's black and there's one really bright dot... It can really make someone that has self-diagnosed OSD go %$&$(#*&%$$#!??!!??!?!?!?!Don't let this swing your opinion one way or the other, because I'm almost 100% sure it won't happen to you.

On 3/11/14, the notebook ceased closing down using the Settings/Power shut down and would only shut down by pressing the on/off button.  I was on the phone with tech support for 2 hours hoping to fix the issue without having to send the laptop back.  No luck, was told it was a hardware problem and I had to send back to HP.  I spent days and days downloading software, photos, music and files that contained sensitive information.  Now I will have to go and delete the sensitive files to secure the data and then reload again.  Have no idea what, if anything, will be lost though HP says they will backup.  It's uncomfortable to send a laptop to a stranger fearing \"snooping\" of sensitive data that I may forget to delete.  It seems unreasonable to have a hardware failure less than a month after receiving the laptop.  Of course, I've already paid for it, so I'm a bit concerned about that as well.

I've never used an HP before, but right now HP's are the highest rated laptops (at least from what I can interpret), and I decided to branch out with this Pavilion. My needs were as follows:6 GB of RAM or higherAMD processor OR Intel i3/i4/i5DVD/CD burner and built-in webcam and micUSB 2.0 and USB 3.0Port for storage cardsWindows 8.1Don't die on m after only 2 years!!!It has already met these needs, except for the last one, it's only been on for a few hours.I'm a gamer, especially fond of Minecraft which is a painfully laggy game and I decided I would spend a little more money and get 6 GB of RAM and a better processor. After about 10 minutes on the internet I realized just how awful my Gateway's processor was and how slow it was in general. My Pavilion is probably 3 times as fast!As far as Windows 8 is concerned... it works fine on this computer, and my only complaint is Windows 8 requires a lot of clicking and unclicking around and the texture of the mousepad isn't very sensitive so I have to tap it pretty hard to select things. Even if that wasn't a problem I was going to get a mouse anyways, it's just very annoying.My fave features are the number-pad, since I've been without one for a while. The size and resolution of the screen is fantastic. Watching stuff on Netflix feels more like a TV screen, which is wonderful. I have all of my settings the way I like them with Windows, and I found new settings I didn't know existed before (like turning off the start-up/volume lever/cursor at the end of a sentence/etc annoyingly unnecessary ping noises)..Very quiet keyboard, and it's nice to eat food around my laptop and know crumbs won't get stuck under the keys. There are plenty of HP and Windows help guides too.I'm having an awful time getting Norton Internet Security to uninstall. I use Panda Cloud Antivirus, which works better and is free. I've had terrible experiences with Norton in the past and even though I went through the uninstall process, I keep finding Norton related settings, something I told it to NOT keep on my computer. If there was an option to say don't install Norton when I bought this laptop, I would've done it.Overall I am very happy with this laptop and I highly recommend it!", "Date": "February 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Rating The Laptop NOT Windows 8", "Author": "Bradley S.

I tried to follow them but I was kept getting an error message stating something was missing from a drive and it could not restart.  I contacted HP again and they said they would send a box for me to send the computer to them and they would repair the problem, I was informed this would take about nine days.  After only having the computer for 7 days I told them this was unacceptable and they could sending a new computer would be the only resolution to this problem that I would be satisfied with.  I was informed a Case Manager would contact me shortly.  I started playing around in the settings and got the computer to reset itself to factory settings.  This was really aggravating, your Support Tech could not give proper instructions and with Google and 10 minutes I was able to get the reset started.  A couple hours after the reset was done the problem was still not fixed.  I contacted Amazon, returned the product and went back to Toshiba.  I was tried HP because of a suggestion from a friend and the price of the product.  Never again will I return, mostly because of their poor service.Two days after I sent the HP back for a refund I got a call for the Case Manager apologizing about the problem and asked if I could send the computer in so they could fix it.  After explaining how disappointed I was in their product and poor Tech Support I told her I returned the product and was going back to Toshiba which I have used for years.  She apologized again then offered an extended warranty on any HP computer.Thanks for nothing HP!", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "POOR CUSTOMER SUPPORT.", "Author": "SANDY JEAN SHUFELT", "ReviewID": "R2YL784G5QLHO4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Week one.  Had issues with BIOS.  When  I called tech support it was the worst experience I have EVER encountered.  I will not recommend anyone to use HP support.  My issue was resolved with a Microsoft support tech that knew exactly what my issue was and informed me what I had to do to resolve it.  I believe having support is NOT hiring idiots from another country to try to resolve issues they have NO knowledge of.  Bad move on HP part.

I like everything of Applie air other than it does not have adobe flash.  Some window programs in the website does not run in apple, so I decide to get a window laptop.

The window 8 is a headackes compare with my HP pc has vista (that used to be a headache too).  It is very slow.  When I tried to stream movie from Amazon, the screen is very blue.  I can not figure out how to adjust the color.  The resolution is terrible (may be I am used to Apple Air's resolution.)  I just hate it.  I tried for a few weeks, even bought a few program for window 8.  I deicide that I can not live with this giant and I will try to return.I would not recommand this.
