I ordered it with a Solid State hard drive, and 8 GB of memory.  The company which sells it, Eluktronics, has been extremely kind, patient, and willing to answer my many questions and help me with all my request changes.  I will always buy from them in future.  The computer is very fast, the keyboard very easy to use, the monitor size is great, yet the computer isn't bulky.  I also like the fact that when the computer is closed, the outside casing is not the shiny black that shows every smudge and all fingerprints.  Rather it is a non-reflective black color, that is smooth to the touch.  I ordered Window 7 Professional, that seems to be no different than any other version of Windows 7.  Eluktronics sent me the discs necessary to \"upgrade\" to Windows 8, if I ever decide I enjoy total frustration.", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it!!", "Author": "ROBERT ENGLAND", "ReviewID": "R1PH2HMVJ59WNI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this laptop with 12GIG memory to enjoy its fast boot time. And it is FAST, fully up in about 17seconds.Programs initiate and run much faster also.I had no trouble retrofitting my programs and \"mods\" to the WIN7. I use 1TB external USB3 drive to store data because of the limited SSD size.I would recommend this laptop and the supplier - all as advertised.", "Date": "May 16, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$799.99", "Features": "Windows 7 Professional 64-Bit; AMD Elite A6-5350M 2.9GHz up to 3.5GHz Accelerated Processor\n15.6\" diagonal LED-backlit HD anti-glare display (1366 x 768); 4GB DDR3L 1600MHz RAM (2 Dimm)\n120GB Solid State (SSD) Performance SATA III Hard Drive; AMD Radeon HD 8450G Graphics; DVD+/-RW\n802.11b/g/n; Gigabit Ethernet; Webcam; 3 x USB 3.0; USB 2.0; 6-Cell 48 Wh Li-Ion Battery (Up to 6.2 hours)\nSpill-Resistant Keyboard with Numeric Keypad; Dolby Audio V2; HDMI; VGA; 1 Year Lenovo Warranty", "Name": "Lenovo ThinkPad Edge E545 AMD Elite 15.6-Inch Windows 7 Professional Business Notebook PC (A6-5350M 2.9GHz, 120GB Performance SSD Hard Drive, Windows 7 PRO, 4GB RAM)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41pY38y6ZHL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00IIEKVTU"}}
