One that was complete, it became a nice quiet laptop that fully meets my hardware needs. Windows 8, however, I still do not like, but that is not what I'm reviewing here.Original post:I like everything about this laptop (not counting Windows 8 which, so far, I do not like) except for its fan noise. It's quiet for a little bit when I first boot it, but once it warms up the fan comes on and is annoyingly loud. Once on I have not yet had the fan slow back down into quietness. I haven't yet decided if this is annoying enough to return it. I'll decide that this weekend. All of my previous laptops were quieter than this one. I'm leaning toward a non-Dell but don't know which might be better and quieter.", "Date": "April 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good system for the price", "Author": "Mearrf", "ReviewID": "R313T2O9UTVXMZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was replacing my older Dell with this one.

After having the agent repeat herself after each statement I had to do the same. I have a southern accent and she had another. After about and hour she said it was the mother board and I would have a box to return it in two days. I said I bought a new computer and that is what I want, not a repaired computer. She checked with the manager and he said they would do that. It would take 10 to 13 business days. I can get a computer box in two days and a box with a computer takes 10 to 13 business days.

For what I was looking for this one matched what I wanted for the price I could afford. So far I couldn't be happier. I had to get used to Windows 8, but it didn't take long to figure out how it works. I actually really like it because you can go between the \"Start\" page & a regular desktop screen. The \"start\" page is customizable so you can put all your favorite programs on one page without having to navigate through other stuff to get the program/s you want to use.I do not use my laptop for anything fancy: regular internet stuff such as checking e-mails, hanging out on a few forums & my favorite websites, Netflix (hence why I bought a laptop with such a large screen), editing my business website, search engines when necessary, etc. Once you get used to everything its very easy to navigate including settings. Im not very techy so I cant give a fancy review about RAM & RPM, but for what its worth the computer runs smoothly, quickly, & I haven't had any issues so far. This computer starts up & is functional VERY quickly: it doesnt take more than a minute or 2 to start up from when you hit the power button to typing in your log in password & getting to the \"start\" page.The touch pad took getting used to as well, & like any laptop it makes scrolling a little difficult & slow, but I bought a wireless mouse for when I need to do stuff with extra speed. The screen is bright (when you set it to be), & all pictures/images are clear & crisp.A full battery lasts a little over 6 hours at full screen brightness (which is a big battery killer), & charging a dead battery takes no more than 2 hours. This laptop comes with a battery monitor so it tells you percentage & how much longer your battery should last as well as battery health (so you know when the battery needs replacing), & there are settings you can change if you plan to keep the laptop plugged in for extended periods of time, plan on frequently charging it with a not low battery (ex: 50%, 75%, etc), etc.Shipping wise it was packed well & arrived on time.The only con is the size of the laptop can be be a bit bulky, but I think its worth it so its not a huge deal for me.Overall VERY happy with my purchase!", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Desktop Replacement", "Author": "R. Bernard", "ReviewID": "RH5LAACU93K43", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "SPECS:OS: Windows8 64bitCPU: Intel Core I5-4200 @ 1.60GHzMemory: 8GB installed, supports 16GBVideo: Intel(R) HD Graphics Family with 2GB of memoryScreen: 17\" touch screenGood:1. Aluminum body is beautiful, looks awesome when closed.2. Light up keyboard with number pad3. Access to all major components (Battery, HDD, memory, optical drive) See below4. Decent video capabilities. I have the laptop connected to a 20\" external monitor (DVI to HDMI adapter required) and use the notebook as a second monitor with no problems. I was able to RCT3 on steam with no issue, which is about as extreme as I normally go!5. Nice wide feet. The laptops feet go all the way across the laptop.6. Touch screen. I tried it out briefly and it works as expected. I'm not sure how much I'll use it but it's a nice to have.7. Nice big touch pad that supports gestures.8. Included dell software lets battery charge float instead of remaining at 100% constantly which can reduce battery life.Bad:1. Battery access compartment is hard to access without scratching the finish. Be very careful and don't rush or you will scratch it guaranteed; don't ask how I know this! If you do go in, try to do all your upgrades at once to minimize the chances of scratching the case. Of course now that I think about it a suction cup would probably make this a breeze.2. Network jack has a fold down door because of the low side profile. It seems fairly sturdy but, I can't say how it will hold up in the long run so be mindful when plugging in a network cable.Indifferent:1. My laptop came with a WD blue 750GB HDD which was decent. I swapped in a 256 Samsung Pro SSD I had on hand and the speed difference is awesome; boot times were no more than 10 seconds and that is being conservative.See note above about accessing the battery compartment if you go this route. Once the door was off the swap out was easy. Disable secure boot in the BIOS before you clone the existing HDD or it won't work (Samsung data migration software). I haven't re enabled it but, I might try later and see if it works.2. Windows 8. I wish it came with the pro version but I can upgrade that later3. The screen, I have yet to find a laptop monitor the looks as good as a desktop and this is no different. It still is acceptable.Overall:Great laptop for a person who is ready to let go of the desktop permanently.  I do wish it had an option for a full fledged docking station but, at this price point (879 as equipped that's asking a bit much)", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointed...", "Author": "L. Lilly", "ReviewID": "R2WM8Y69GCYABL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I really wanted to love this laptop and give it 5 stars but I can't. I bought it a week ago and put 16GB memory and a 7200rpm 1TB drive in it. Wow, it's fast and I love it.....when it's working.  I solved the random freezing and shutting down problem and the noisy fan problem by downloading the latest BIOS on Dell's website.  Ok, great.  But now I'm unhappy again because the Wi-Fi works randomly...it works for about 5 minutes, and then drops the connection.  So I have to reboot to get the Wi-Fi working again and the connection back until it drops again.  If I leave my computer for a little while and come back, the Wi-Fi will be disconnected - it's very annoying to have to reboot all the time for this problem.  So I went to Dell's site and downloaded the latest Wi-Fi drivers and installed them.  It helped a little bit and keeps the connection a little longer now, but it's still dropping my connection after 20-60 minutes, even when I'm in the middle of something - it's very annoying.  My sister's old Lenovo, my cell phone, my brother's Acer, and others have no problem keeping connected to the same various Wi-Fi routers as we're traveling, but this laptop's Wi-Fi has a problem.  I can't deal with this problem as I travel a lot and need Wi-Fi reliability.  My 3 year old Dell laptop was great but unfortunately I gave it to a friend and don't have it anymore...I was hoping this one would be as reliable.  It looks like I will have to RMA it and buy something else.  Now I'm here at my friend's house two states away from where I live, and it's dropping me again. Ok, I'm done with this laptop, will find and buy another one and RMA this one. It's getting frustrating now. Sorry Dell or Intel, if you can fix the Wi-Fi issues, then I would love this laptop.*Update - Yes i know about the Intel Centrino Wireless Adapter issues and I've addressed the cause and solutions given by Intel but to no avail.  Still randomly disconnecting.  Here what Intel says about the issue -CauseAn adapter internal error related to power management has occurred. This problem only occurs when some level of adapter power savings mode is enabled.WorkaroundA workaround for the affected releases is to disable all adapter power savings modes. You can do this by  selecting the lowest power management setting, which enables the maximum wireless network performance.Intel also says that the latest driver software fixes the problem - well it didn't fix mine.**Update again - I have the proposed fix for the Intel Centrino Wireless Adapter problem -Here they are:  In the Intel Centrino Wireless-N 2230 Adapter Advanced settings, make the following changes and the wireless disconnection problems hopefully will be eliminated.802.11n Mode = ENABLEDAd Hoc Channel 802.11b/g = 11Bluetooth(R) AMP = DISABLEDMixed Mode Protection = RTS/CTS EnabledRoaming Agressiveness = 5.HIGHESTSleep on WoWLAN Disconnect = DISABLEDTransmit Power = 5.HIGHESTWake on Magic Packet = DISABLEDWake on Pattern Match = DISABLEDWireless Mode = 3. 802.11b/gI hope these settings fix my wi-fi problems.  So with the current BIOS, latest drivers, and these settings, maybe there won't be anymore problems?  I hope I don't have to RMA this laptop because I want to love it. I will give it a few days to determine if everything is fixed now or not.", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "A beautifully designed work machine that gets the job done", "Author": "Femi Olawuyi", "ReviewID": "RCDQ7ECEW5K6I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my new laptop, it replaced my old one a dell inspiron 1525.

There were a few issues with the default settings for the laptop that were a little irritating. For example, the wireless connection would drop out randomly. Come to find out that it was set to disconnect if power use gets too high. It is a setting that is easily changed but why would they make that the default? Kind of silly. Also, the automatic updating which updated and then restarted my computer randomly was irritating until I figured out how to change that setting. Aside from these strange default settings, I have to give the laptop five stars because it has performed admirably in every other task that I have needed it for.

I killed that one by accidentally spilling a bottle of PowerAde all over it (PowerAde doesn't give more power to computers :-))  So, obviously I like the computer, since I've purchased it twice.  Here's the ups and downs from this one that I purchased on Amazon.LOVE/STILL LOVE:- Big screen, with clear picture- Full Keyboard with numbers pad- Great space-saving alternative to a desktop- Good audioNOT SO GOOD:- I miss my old one - this one came with Windows 8, which I absolutely hate. Not intuitive, everything is automatically linked to make MSN and Bing your main portals (email, search, people, news, etc. buttons --- all going to their sites.  Looked for a way to change it - but couldn't find one.  It's just a pain, and I don't know why Dell let Microsoft's desires win out over customer ease of use.- I generally always hate setting up a computer with the software I use, apps and bookmarks all over again... (thus, buying them from people that have already loaded them with MS Office, etc.)  The lack of easy user interface on this one, made that process even more painful.- It's big. It's heavy. To me, it really is, for the most part my home computer.  Easy enough to move around the house, and occasionally take on a road trip - but, I wouldn't ever plan on using this as my regular \"carting it around the world\" on a regular basis laptop.BOTTOM LINE: Great computer with all the features, speed and a nice big screen for movie watching that make it worth the cost, brought down by Dell putting Windows 8 on it and making the user interface so difficult to use.", "Date": "October 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY!!!", "Author": "Kurt Koehler \"Kurt\"", "ReviewID": "R24CUNM5TZNMON", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "bought this laptop last week.
