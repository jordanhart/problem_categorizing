{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice Lenovo Laptop. Love the keyboard layout", "Author": "AnitaMargarita", "ReviewID": "R1PRK1MG0NF2L9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Lenovo Thinkpads have always had the best keyboard layout in my opinion. This economy priced model has everything my college student needed at a great price. Unlike the Compaq CQ's and the low end HP series, this unit has Intel processor not AMD. You can get it with an AMD but why really? For the price point of this unit it feels great, not cheap. I like it so much I am going to order another one for me since this one is for my daughter in college.Shipping from this vendor was a little slower than others, but not unbearable. I guess Amazon's fast shipping has spoiled me.If you need a great value in a laptop, you might really like this model.", "Date": "March 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Revised: Broke after seven months, had to haggle Lenovo, pay for a diagnosis from a technician before Lenovo would fix it", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R1BF170HDJJYQS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "REVISED again!!! SEE BELOWThe computer seems to slow down a bit sometimes when a couple applications are open which is why I gave it a four star rating but overall i am happy with the purchase^ABOVE is my initial review of this computer.However, after 7 months of very light use, windows is failing to boot and I am getting disk errors. Make note I bought this to have a second computer to keep at my house since I tend to leave my Toshiba at work.  Now I understand you get what you pay for, but I've had a Toshiba Satellite, that costs less than this Lenovo, for over 3 years without an issue, AND I use it all day at work, while the Lenovo gets less than 2 hours use a day if it's lucky. Anyway, I'm totally not thrilled. Hopefully, I get dealt with appropriately by the vendor and/or manufacturer and either get a replacement or speedy repair. After all, I understand electronics break down, but a company is only good as their guarantee/warranty/service on the products they make and sell.^Above is my first revisionI know we rate sellers here so I left a 4 star rating, because it isn't really the sellers fault that this computer was crap. If I was rating Lenovo, then I'd give them 2-3 stars. This was a manufacturing issue from the get go. The hard drive failed. I personally believe that when an item is under warranty, you shouldn't nickle and dime customers...do not try to charge me for technical support to try and fix my under warranty computer. Don't even try to troubleshoot over the phone... just send a UPS or FEDEX label, I'll ship it out to you, you fix it, and send it back.  I am good with computers, but not at fixing them. I got the run around for about a week from Lenovo about a computer that was 7 months old, barely used, and just died on me.  I called Lenovo and they tried to help me boot the computer. So at first they thought it was a software issue so they tried to teach me how to reinstall windows, it didn't work, so they sent me the discs to try to reinstall windows which took 3 days to arrive, it didn't work, so I decided to drive and spend $25 for a diagnosis from a computer technician thinking that maybe if I know what's wrong that I could forward that info to Lenovo and maybe they'd fix it. So I spent the $25 plus $10 in gas to drop it off and pick it up. Ohh, the hard drive failed. I called Lenovo, and from there, surprisingly they were great. Everything went pretty seemless, they got me the label, I sent it, they fixed it, and sent it back. So here's the deal. If you have a software issue with Lenovo you're on your own, but if you have hardware issue, you'll probably have to prove your case first, and spend several hours on the phone with different people transferring you to different departments. Ohh make sure you keep that reference number handy...you'll need it, alot.", "Date": "July 20, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005SQH068"}}
