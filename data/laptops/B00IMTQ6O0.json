Lau", "ReviewID": "R3C9Q0K3MJVOBA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Definitely a 5 star product, Package came in 2-3 days, (superfast), sent by UPS and had to sign. The MSI893 is a BEAST!!! it definitely replace my desktop gaming computer, because I don't have a lot of desk room. Everything came perfectly package and sealed, completely NEW, the anti-glare screen is great, the steelseries keyboard is really cool, can set macros for every key and change the colors as well.The reason I gave this a 5 star is its inside specs, it definitely runs on ULTRA HIGH for ALL games, and I can get 50-60 fps AVG. and on LOW settings I can get over 100+ fps. I mostly bought it to play large scale mmorpgs, (Wildstar, final fantasy XIV, Diablo 3, league of legends, etc.) they all work perfectly with zero lag. The new nvidia card works great as well. The MSI itself also has a built in extra Fan button which keeps it cooler even when your going hardcore in your gaming and playing for a long-long time. (only trade off is its pretty loud) But for a gamer it shouldn't mind. The MSI overall heater re-direction is pretty well, haven't noticed the keyboard areas hot, and the right hand side mouse area is not hot either. The heat is directed towards the upper left side of the MSI and it can get rather hot if you leave anything in that area (recommended to NOT have anything in that area lol or it will get hot too).Software also comes with windows 8.1 but really not a huge issue.CON: its rather pricy, but the specs and parts are all worth it if you can afford it. Not everyone has enough room for a desktop or want to go buy every single part to build a gaming machine. (i prefer the all-in-one)ps. had debated to get the Alienware 17 but the specs are on a different par, the MSI 893 is definitely the better deal, better parts, better specs, better gaming laptop. Definitely for the Hardcore Gamer.", "Date": "May 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent Gaming Laptop", "Author": "Fowzi Shakkour", "ReviewID": "R4HMH1X5ZDITJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent gaming laptop, where reasonable price and performance meet.Keyboard is very comfortable, large keys (for big hands like mine :-) ) works flawlessly. GPU and internal graphics cards works very good. the driver switches between Intel and NVidia graphics cards based on application demand. Cool most of the time. Heat dissipation is excellent during games. Very silent during browsing and office application, Noise is acceptable during demanding games, using headphones would be better.There is one very small spot in the screen with bad pixel, can hardly be noticed, unless you have a fully white background, the bad spot is not absolutely black, its somewhat gray and its very small, but this does not affect my experience and gaming as it is hardly seen, and after getting past the point where you are actually searching for these pixels, the brain totally filters these points out and you don't see it any more and forget about it :-)Great buy, not regretting it.", "Date": "May 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "First laptop with bad pixel on LED display", "Author": "kk", "ReviewID": "R3O4ZBURQMBSES", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Never seen a laptop with a single bad pixel with LED display before. And MSI said it is common and can't be prevented. Even more they said they can fix it only if there are 7 or more bad pixel on the display. Which made perfect non sense to me. Although the other parts seems ok but still I don't like this attitude.BTW, their customer service system is BS. I have to pull out the battery to find the service # and the it's not real time service on the internet. Once you post your request you gonna wait till you get an email saying someone has replied you. And that's it. They will ask a lot of dumb questions as if I'm a stupid fool that I can't tell if its hardware issue or software problem.So as a conclusion, if you get a good one then I believe it is pretty awesome. But if you get a bad one like I do, it's BS.", "Date": "March 22, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00IMTQ6O0"}}
