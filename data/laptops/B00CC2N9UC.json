It works great and is a powerful little computer.Great for use on airplanes:With the relaxing of regulation for the use of electronics on airplanes during take-off, I use this during take-off in Tablet mode.Also because of the way the screen folds up from the middle it give you more room when the person sitting in front of you, on the plane, leans their seat back.My only complaint is .... I wish it had a mouse pad and a larger drive.I highly recommend getting the one with 8GB of memory and i7-3537u processor (there is an i5 version with only 4GB).Note: I upgraded my S20 to a 480GB mSATA SSD (search amazon for CT480M500SSD3). Please also note this voids the warranty!!!!! It wasn't easy. The S20 uses a half size mSATA SSD. The largest half size mSATA I could find was a 128GB. The reason for the half size mSATA is because the battery gets in the way, leaving only enough space for a half size card. There is however a large open space close by inside the case (it looks like enough space for a 2.5 drive .... but the isn't any mounting or connectors for one) I was able to put in a full size mSATA by using a mini-PCIe extender cable with adapter (search for amazon for B00EQ1XQHS). Mini-PCIe uses the same pins (just a different protocol) as mSATA. It worked perfectly, but requires disassembling the laptop almost completely (search the web for S20_Disassembly.pdf). Please understand this voids the warranty and I take no responsibility, or liability, for the out come from this modification. I just wanted to let people know it is possible.", "Date": "April 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "perfect laptop for road warriors", "Author": "Cristian Castro", "ReviewID": "R3NJA0NS6WQ76E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Quick and light, it is comfortable to transport and battery 4 hr hard.
