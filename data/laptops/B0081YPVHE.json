Very surprised after reading other reviews that say it can sometimes run hot.- Fantastic keyboard.- Very nice sound quality. Sound is better in my headphones than my iMac.- Nice graphics.- Perfect size.Cons:- Battery life is only ~4 hours.- A little heavier than other new laptops, though this isn't a big issue.*I have not tried gaming on this computer.Overall, I'd say this computer is a great purchase for any student, especially for the price.", "Date": "October 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "A sad experience", "Author": "Slabu Gabriel Ionel", "ReviewID": "R1BZFFMFCBM2VV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I think it would be a great laptop for me, if it came in my possession. But because of an irresponsible seller I could not enjoy it. Now, after all we've been through, I got an aversion to the brand Dell because I can not control in my position from where he left the problem that I faced. I decided to buy another brand from a different source. Large corporations have nothing human in them. People do not mean anything to them. Only their profit matters. I was left with a bitter taste after this experience. I've heard stories about how sellers on Amazon do anything to leave a good impression and to please customers. I had to fight with them to get my money spent unnecessarily and that was all I got from them.", "Date": "May 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Rate computer I just purchased", "Author": "James R Hall", "ReviewID": "R3NCM6LDSNSAWD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I like the computer and it works for what I am looking for.

I will only buy direct from manufacturers going forward because the box it arrived in was very banged up. It's heavier and slower than I would like, but I see another review that makes me think I could remove some games and software demos for faster speed. The USB ports don't recognize my 2 year old printer.It's funny to read that someone else commented on the crappy keyboard because I knew I liked typing on other laptops more, but didn't think about why. I shouldn't have skimped on the numeric keypad as I really miss it.

It would move around when I was typing & randomly select links or jump to other open windows.  I also use an external wireless mouse because the touchpad controls became annoying.  I went to the touchpad controls & adjusted it to the lowest sensitivity & turned off drag lock.  It helped a little.  I also noticed that tapping the touchpad to click wasn't very responsive.I was using the touchpad & no external mouse yesterday & then the buttons (right & left) stopped working.  I could still move the pointer around the screen, but could not click on anything.  I reconnected my wireless mouse via USB & for some reason, the wireless mouse's drivers needed to be reinstalled. Once the wireless mouse was reinstalled, I then had problems using that one.  I could move that pointer around, but it would also not click on anything.  I rebooted the computer.  I then had a problem with the keyboard.  The wireless mouse worked, but when I tried to type my password to unlock my computer & the keyboard was unresponsive.  The touchpad buttons still didn't work.  I rebooted again & had the same problem.  I then went to the onscreen keyboard drop down menu & reselected US (international).  The keyboard started working again, so I relogged into the computer & went back to the touchpad controls to switch right/left button functionality (buttons still didn't work after that) & switched them back (still didn't work), turned off/on the touchpad (didn't resolve problem), went to tapping to check the setting-both tapping & drag lock were checked (not sure why drag lock was re-enabled)-turned drag lock off again & tested tapping, which still didn't work.  I turned the touchpad off/on with the fn f3 keys & that still didn't work.  I also noticed the wireless mouse worked on most of the screen, but for some reason wouldn't work on a few spots (clicking or dragging) on the right side of the screen. I rebooted again & the keyboard & wireless mouse appeared to be working fine.  I then went online & looked up help & saw a TON of people with Dell's have touchpad issues.  I checked for updates for it's drivers & it said they were up-to-date & the windows diagnostic said the device was working properly (which it is not).  The only thing I changed on the computer that day was to turn the hot key in the upper right hand corner to be \"turn off display\".This morning I see that Amazon isn't even selling this model anymore & the product is under review because customers have said something is wrong with it.

I'm not sure why the seller does not change or include this in the description, as a clarification seems suitable. In any event, this is my second inspiron. I really like it thus far. The sound is unbelievable as they have moved the speakers to the front. I did not give it 5 stars due to the highly reflective screen, and the lacking battery life. The keyboard is arranged a bit different than my older inspiron, but that is not an issue for me. I bought this as I did not want a Win 8 model.
