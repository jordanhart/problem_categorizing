It's fast and very responsive. I wasn't sure about the touch screen when I bought the computer but now that I've used it, it's awesome and almost a necessity for windows 8. My only complaint is with the mouse pad...  sometimes the mouse pad appears to stop working out of no where and then a few seconds later will be fine again. Also sometimes the mouse pad will cause you to zoom in and out of things when you aren't trying to do that at all. These issues are a small blemish in an otherwise great computer.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great computer", "Author": "Andrew A.", "ReviewID": "RXVNELEID4WX6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very happy with  function and value.
