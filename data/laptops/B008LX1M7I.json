This laptop is great. If you are looking for a  great laptop I would strongly consider.

I love it so much. I don't even know where to start. I'll put it it notes:-the speakers are amazing-you can watch movies on there-it's fast-easy to navigate around-great condition in shipping. it was in a box AND wrapped in bubble wrap. very secure-PacificMacs also had a letter in there for me explaining the company and how long they served apple, and if there were any problems, I call them. Very informative and helpful.-I love how the apple logo lights up on the back-I'll add pics later-The laptop can speak to me like Siri. You can choose between a guy or a girl, and you hold down the ESC key and talk!-I love how you just slide the disc into the computer slot, instead of having to open the thing like other computers and close it back after putting the disk in....and much more!Cons:-You cant install flash player on here, or the updated version of iTunes. But iTunes still works good, and I've watched tons of movies on here.-May be hard to learn how to use at first if you're used to Windows computers/laptops, but search Google to find out how to use it. I did.Tips:-There is no \"right click\", so Macbook's right click is holding down ctrl, and while holding it down, click on the certain item on the screen that you want to use the \"right click\" on.-To talk to the computer, you need to first turn on the speech recognition by going to settings. after that's done, to talk to it, hold down the ESC key on the top left corner of your macbook.-The area where you insert discs is located in front of the macbook, where you press the button to open the screen lid. slide the disc into there and it'll take it.-To open the macbook, press the button on the front of it and lift the lid.THANKS, PACIFICMACS!", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "PPC fan.", "Author": "N.

While you are at it, you probably can upgrade from 1.33GHz to 1.5GHz.  I like this computer, it's just old enough to have an Appletalk port and modem, and theoretically communicate with my ancient macs, but new enough to use the Internet and archive old data on an external hard drive.

It's working well so far. A little slow but that was expected since it's older. I was mainly just looking to not sink a ton of money into a computer that's going to break soon (I've had HP's and Toshibas mainly in the past 9 years and have gone through maybe six of them - some hand me downs - but it's getting a little old, having a new-ish computer break just when you need it!). Great price, and if this lasts a year or more I figure it's worth it. Customer support seems good - the computer came with a note asking for feedback and leaving contact info if you're not satisfied. So far I'm pretty sure I'd buy from this seller again.", "Date": "May 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Its okay for a starter computer...", "Author": "killer4748", "ReviewID": "R1IWKOFX7NPZMO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have had this PowerBook G4 for about 3 months now.
