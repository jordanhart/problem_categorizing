Well when I received it I could not get it to log on to my wireless system .I called Compaq , they would NOT  help me with out charging  me $ for the help , as I it was told it was over 160 days OUT OF WARRANTY , ( so 1 year and 160 plus days !!! *I would not call that new at all ).So I called ATT my wireless provider , the Advanced Tech ( these guys are smart )tried for 90 minutes to get it to connect to wireless system , finally he told me the thing was a lemon and to return it, so I did . Amazon was very helpful and credited my money back right away , as this was to be a Christmas gift , and I had to run out and buy another one locally . It was the co. Juvalisious who sold it to me thru Amazon, if you buy from this Co.
