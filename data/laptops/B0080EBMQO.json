{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Laptop!", "Author": "Rob M.", "ReviewID": "R3NOGASD8JGMBT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop to replace my older Acer model, which is still running fine after 5 years but I wanted to upgrade.  This computer is a fantastic choice for non-gamers like me!  It has a slim, sleek design (though some might find its solid matte black finish \"boring\"), plus it has the speed and power that my older model was lacking... not to mention the beefy 500 gig hard drive!  Also a plus is the 3.0 USB port, which will certainly come in handy for transferring video files to a flash drive.  The standard \"chicklet\" keyboard is nicely laid out and is comfortable to use, although if you are using a chicklet style keyboard for the first time you may have problems striking all the keys evenly so that all your \"hits\" register on-screen.  Just takes a little practice, that's all.  I cannot comment on the performance of the touchpad, as I have always preferred to use a wireless mouse.  The 16 x 9 screen is brilliantly clear and easy to read, and the speakers are surprisingly adequate for a laptop this thin (about an inch or so).  I'm also pleased that this model contains an optical drive (for DVD's and CD's, but not blu-ray), which many newer computers seem to lack.  My only quibble is the absence of a caps-lock indicator light, although when caps-lock is engaged there is a momentary on-screen icon to alert you.  All in all, this is a GREAT value for anyone wishing to purchase a new full-featured laptop that still has the Windows 7 operating system.  I am highly satisfied with this computer, and I'm sure the majority of average users will feel the same way.", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent product at fair price from Amazon", "Author": "Jaydeep", "ReviewID": "R3TODONVQV7F58", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Laptop met all my criteria, decent performance, light weight and good battery life all at a fair price!!!!

I settled on this Acer model based on reviews and price. There are several things that drive me nuts about it.The keyboard skips letters. No matter how slowly and deliberately or how fast and staccato I type, letters are missing when I proof what I have written. I don't know if it is something to do with the \"chicklet\" type keys and my touch or rhythm, but it is a pain. I have never had this on any other computer I have used-- laptops or desk type. It is annoying because I cannot figure out if it is my fault.The touch pad seems strangely sensitive and does magical things that I do not expect or want. It changes the magnification of the screen randomly. It flips from one tab to another randomly. It closes pages that I am reading, and flips to some former page. It closes and deletes what I am typing. Just moving my finger on the touch pad to get the cursor to the place where I have to insert the letter that was skipped, somehow makes the whole page vanish, makes the magnification jump up or down. I try to be SO CAREFUL, not touch anything accidentally, but it still happens. One reviewer complained that it has no right and left buttons to click, rather you just press the left and right bottom corners of the touch pad. That is NOT a problem. The problem lies in moving the cursor and getting unintended events just from putting a finger somewhere on the pad in order to move the cursor.I switched to a laser wireless mouse that I had sitting around unused, and none of these strange things happen any more as long as I keep my fingers off the touch pad. But if I take it someplace, I have to carry the external mouse along...which is a nuisance. It isn't supposed to be this way.Unfortunately, I got this computer 1 day before I was due to go to Ghana, and it seemed OK while setting it up and registering it, so I put it in my briefcase and went. Now I am over here with no way to find out what is actually going on. At least it works well enough that I can tolerate it until I return to the US.I guess this proves \"you get what you pay for.\"", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable",
