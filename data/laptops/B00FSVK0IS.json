It must have been a reconditioned unit as it arrived with several persistent viruses and have been getting rid of the residue ever since. Mechanically it seems great.The Norton 360 that came with the computer was unaware of the problems and could not fix them.

It booted up and everything seemed to be in factory condition. So far I've had no problems migrating my other data and applications over from an older Toshiba laptop with an intermittently stuck ESC key to this nice laptop with its magnificent display. The first thing I did was to uninstall the usual crapware that comes with all new computers these days, but I'm perfectly happy with it.The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because all the keys are flat and uniform with no texture, which makes it more difficult for me as a touch typist because I prefer slightly contoured keys, but I think a nice soft clear rubber keyboard cover should take care of the problem.", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "bought this laptop", "Author": "Cheryl Slankster", "ReviewID": "RKFABOMSFKCCT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I originally bought this laptop because it still had Windows 7 when after shopping in several stores where they only had Windows 8, usually buy HP products but now I have two favorites!", "Date": "May 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very Good Product", "Author": "SLP", "ReviewID": "R2V2SM9H53VI74", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works very well.
