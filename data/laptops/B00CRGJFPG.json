I'd prefer windows 7.  Installing classic shell and configuring some other things helped some, but it's definitely not ideal.I upgraded to windows 8.1, and this caused more issues than it fixed for me.  Afterwards, the wifi would connect to my router, but it would tell me \"The connection is limited\", and it would take several minutes before I could browse normally.  Nothing was wrong with my router during this time, and I had 2 phones and another computer connected the whole time. This issue was eventually fixed by a new wireless driver.  The upgrade to 8.1 also uninstalled classic shell, put IE back on the task bar, changed the theme I had saved, and did quite a few other annoying things that I had to fix, AGAIN.Presently, I have a problem where every time I restart, windows tells me I don't have an antivirus program selected, even though I have selected my antivirus program EVERY TIME I start up.  It doesn't remember!The laptop, while seeming fine hardware wise (and works really well in ubuntu, btw 6 hrs battery life and quick) is frustrating on win8/8.1.  Constant problems.  Windows8 just isn't ready for prime time, still, even after 8.1, IMO.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "As good as any laptop I've used!", "Author": "Marilyn Chandler", "ReviewID": "RIUCB98YIYGQC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I had to hire a tech. person to get me online, etc.  It didn't seem to be an easy set up as advertised.
