I am astounded how fast the internet is on this and I like Google Chrome.  I switched over from IE because I was getting tired of the constant error messages and having it close all the time.  I'm glad I did, it's easier to use and very stable.  I have an Acer Netbook from two years ago that is great, but slowing down even with 2 GB of Ram. I decided to use that as my \"Windows\" laptop and use this Chromebook for web-surfing. I even use the trackpad because it is the best I have ever used. It works perfectly, and I have come across some really bad trackpads in my day. I know that this is not for everyone but if you have a main desktop or laptop and want a supplemental computer for really fast web-surfing, this is the way to go.  You won't be disappointed.", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "It Supports Flash!!!!", "Author": "LowCarbWoman", "ReviewID": "R21U1M7X63WEM0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this as a side machine to be an in-between for my heavy IBM laptop, and my iOS iPad. I have always loved the Chrome browser (have used since day 1,) so this seemed a logical choice. And the fact that I could play my facebook Flash games on it (can't do that on ipad!) I got this from a groupon, so I didn't pay $200 for it. But after having it a week, I would have. It is a great toy.Pros:- Super lightweight- The apps for it are free!- Super super quiet- Doesn't burn my lap like my laptop does (runs very cool.)- Has a nice soft-touch keyboard- Has a great trackpad which doesn't have breakable keys on it- Has a hi-def screen- Plays flash animations- Can connect to my iCloud, Google drive, and Amazon kindle library (with free app downloads.)- Saves documents, etc. to Google cloud drive so I can grab them on my normal computer as well- Has memory card reader and USB ports- Has a camera for web chattingCons:- Battery life averages about an hour, which can be a hassle- Some newer flash items won't load and it says the flash player is outdated, but Chrome insists it's up-to-date and you can't manually update it- Can't use the machine unless you're on the Internet via wifi or LAN- You have to tap with two fingers on the trackpad to do a mouse right-click- Sound isn't fantastic- Has camera but can't Skype. My family doesn't use Google Hangouts to chat- There are great apps, but not as many as I'd hoped. I'm sure this will change in time.Honestly, the cons may seem big but they're far outweighed by the awesomeness of the pros. Especially Flash. As an iPhone and iPad user, I have missed flash greatly on my portables. This is a great feature and was really the selling point (and the price.)", "Date": "October 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice inexpensive Chromebook that can be modified should you want.", "Author": "bill1228 \"Myersw\"", "ReviewID": "R1NH0IS9MOXRXU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wanted a light weight laptop form factor device for browsing web and doing email, research and most anything else you can think of that is Internet/WEB based.  Also have access to Google Docs so can create documents/spreadsheets or open Microsoft docs. Cannot edit Microsoft documents though. Works just as expected.  Fast startup and browsing.  Has both 2.4 and 5gig wireless support.  Only has 16 GB SSD drive so somewhat limited for storage.  May or may not be a problem depending on your use. If you don't care about warranty, you can break open and change the SSD to something bigger.  In my case I had a 120GB SSD laying around so I replaced the 16GB with it.  I was wanting to dual boot Linux on it so figured the larger drive would be better.Con:  Only issue that I have right now is with bluetooth support. Only recently did they provide a version of Chrome OS for this device that supports bluetooth, hardware was there just not usable. Support currently is primarily for keyboards and mice and limited for bluetooth speakers/headphones. I have a Jawbone Minijambox that it sees but will not pair with.  Audio bluetooth support is a work in progress right now. I am currently running the latest beta code.  Still will not pair.  Have also tried the developer version and that did not pair eitherNote to folks that are thinking of getting one of these.You will see a number of negative reviews, not just for this Chromebook but others as well.  If you read them, folks were expecting a cheap laptop that would do everything a Windows or MAC laptop would do.  That is not the case.  Think of a more along the lines of  a tablet with a bigger screen, more memory and storage and a physical keyboard.  If this is what you are wanting then this is a good device.  IF you are looking for a cheap laptop, no matter what Chromebook you buy, you will be disappointed.--bill", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for what it is", "Author": "D.

I bought this laptop so I could bring it to school and leave my windows machine at home. I have been pleasantly surprised. Despite only having 2 gigs of ram and a celeron processor this thing really zips around between tasks. It boots up in like 5 seconds. The screen looks good enough. If you do most of your work through Google services even if the laptop breaks your files will still be there waiting for you along with your emails and bookmarks. I am satisfied with it but there are problems that may be a deal breaker for some.Cons: 1 - this pissed me off and I don't understand it. Only a very select few of printers will work with this machine. You have to use Google Cloud Print and it makes sense for businesses but for home use it's impractical. Google needs to step up and create drivers for our printers so we can just plug them into the usb and go2 - Although it has a Solid State Drive there is at least one moving part which is the fan that blows on the processor. I assumed that there would be no fan for such a low powered processor but I was wrong. On one occasion the machine did get very hot on the left side.3 - I had problems getting the chromebook to display on my TV through vga and hdmi. This problem may have to do with my TV that doesn't support many resolutions.4 - This is the most annoying problem. There is some kind of grounding problem in the laptop. When the battery runs low the trackpad becomes very very difficult to use. It's so inaccurate it's just infuriating. The only \"solution\" I've seen to this problem is to touch the vga port while using the trackpad and this fixes the ground problem but this problem shouldn't exist.Overall if these cons don't bother you it is well worth it's price at $199", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Acer C7, Big Win!", "Author": "Rizzle", "ReviewID": "RO4G1EIO0MBFC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased because I wanted a second machine for checking email and browsing youtube. Works great, super fast, tried to install Ubuntu but for some reason the internet would not work =(. However I will not hold that against it.I do love how light it is, it runs quiet, and starts from a cold boot in about 25 seconds (I'm not kidding), screen color is vivid and video play back (@720P res..) is flawless.These are limitations of the machine, not downsides!- Battery life is short, not suprising in something this light.- O.S. use is limited offline (Well.. lets be honest, its useless w/o an internet connection!)SO... If you just need a fast little machine that does about what a tablet does, you'll probably like this.IF you're one of those special people that can't read the description and think you're getting a full blown laptop, you're probably going to be disapointed.", "Date": "October 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Even better than I expected", "Author": "DaveR", "ReviewID": "R2O6P6RPAEMIFA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been wanting to try out a chromebook for a while, and finally decided for two hundred bucks (for this apparently about to be superseded model), what the heck. So far, I am amazed at how fast and easy to use this product is. Overall, I'm finding it a lot of fun to use.It will definitely be great for traveling - for example, when you want to look something up quickly - because of how fast it starts up. So far it has been taking no more than 2 seconds to boot up and the browser snaps open instantly. In fact, it seems to get a stronger signal than my desktop machines, for some reason. I don't expect to use this for any heavy-duty work, but I could definitely work on this if I had to, and the offline apps seem sufficient for saving docs, emails, etc. Netflix works flawlessly.I have noticed a little stuttering in streaming media (youtube, etc.) when trying to open a different app, but nothing too significant.So far, the only drawback for me is not being able to use Skype. I haven't tried to use Google Hangouts yet, but the problem I foresee is that it's just not as widely used or as familiar to many people as Skype. But if I find out differently, I'll come back and revise this.Keyboard is pretty flat, but tactile enough - I'd say it's comparable to most laptop keyboards. I was skeptical about the touchpad, but I'm finding it quite convenient and easy to use. I like the two-finger gesture for scrolling (vertically or horizontally) which I actually find easier than using a mouse.Sound is quite tinny - you wouldn't want to listen to music without headphones, but it is audible enough when watching a video.", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "worth every penny", "Author": "Allison Payne nee' Mobley", "ReviewID": "R2V8KPLJ7GM0K0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i got one of these for each of my girls because of the anti virus software that comes built in, their size and portability, and the ability to put a jumpdrive in.  without amazon's 'no interest for 12 months' options, i could not have done this, but that made it work as well as the low price.  great value, terrific product, my teens love theirs. xmas is covered!", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Know what you are buying", "Author": "Grady Cash \"fisky\"", "ReviewID": "R99EB0NWQ1IXY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I always read the 1-star reviews before buying something to make sure that there isn't some recurring problem with the device. In this case, I saw a lot of uninformed consumers blaming the Chromebook for not being something it never claimed to be and not being willing to figure out how to use it properly.First, it's not a big screen, DVD-built in, windows-based laptop with free Microsoft Office. Given those known restrictions before buying, the Chromebook will do a lot more than many new owners realize. It can read, edit, create, and save Word .docx files. To save a google doc in this format, click file, then download as, and then select Microsoft Word (.docx). If you prefer, you can access a full MS office clone online using one of the many extensions available for free in the Chrome browser. For example, the RollApp extension for OpenOffice will give you almost complete compatibility with MS Office files.If 16GB isn't enough storage, you can add a 32-64GB SD card... or swap out as many SD cards as you wish. If you change the proper settings, you can read files in your google drive while offline. You can also read, edit, and create files offline. (You have to wait until you get online to convert a google doc into a Word .docx format.)  If you're like me, you can load Crouton and have a full functioning Linux Ubuntu system so you can basically have a fully functional laptop without the hassles of a windows OS.Pro:- lightweight!- great value- easy for novices- very capable by adding extensions for OpenOffice, etc- compatible with most MS Office files with a little user knowledge- becomes a fully functional laptop with tweaks to run Linux via CroutonNeutral:- 11.6\" screen- Not windows- No DVD drive- No software. Everything is done in the Chrome browser- Requires minor user expertise to figure out extensions, which is a real key to getting all you can out of this device- Must be online until user figures out how to use it offlineCon:- Printing requires a cloud ready printer or printing through another computer linked to an older printer via Google set up in Chrome browser on 2nd computer.In short, this is a great little device for consumers who just want to surf the 'net or check email and facebook. It's a surprisingly good system for power users who are willing to tweak it a bit.Just realize what you are buying.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice", "Author": "Sami", "ReviewID": "R1GJ6JXR9G0K56", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nice piece to have, quick and simple, good for travel and mobile work conditions.

He was using my HP laptop for basic things and would get confused with Windows 8 (I mean, who wouldn't???), and never used any of the other programs.  His computer usage consists of watching Youtube videos, writing an occasional email in Gmail and doing a few searches here and there on Chrome.  He hates tablets and really wanted a keyboard, but didn't need a huge screen like on my laptop.  We checked out the Acer Chromebook at Wal Mart.  He liked the size of it, but I was concerned about the volume.  It was supposedly turned all the way up at Wal Mart, but was still difficult to hear.  We chalked it up to all the noise in the store.  I'm happy to say, we were right.  He can sit in our living room and play a video it sounds just right for him.  Of course, it's not like it's awesome sound, but it's adequate.  The setup was super simple.  Put the battery in and it's on and ready to go!  The basic apps are already loaded.  Gmail, Chrome, Youtube, etc.  You can download more at the app store.  Everything loads quickly, the picture looks great, and as I mentioned, the sound is fine.  This would make a great laptop for someone, like my husband, who isn't super familiar with computers who wants to do general things on one,  There's nothing confusing about it.

BUT there are both Pros and Cons, in my experience:Pros:  The Chrome OS is very lightweight which means the Chromebook boots up almost instantly (or in just a few seconds), unlike Windows computers which are SLOOOW booting;  During set-up, one only must \"AGREE\" to Google's Terms Of Service once, and those terms are pretty simple and easy to understand (with Windows, any iteration, one must \"AGREE\" several times to Microsoft's Terms of Service, which are VERY complex, often contradictory, impossible for ordinary people to understand, are VERY one-sided, giving Microsoft everything and its \"Valued\" customers almost nothing except for the privilege of paying BEAUCOUP $$$$$$$$$$);  The Chrome WebStore has a lot of very nice apps, but they are all very Google-centric (not very differernt from MS in that aspect) ((Just Why Google doesn't make its Google Play available on Chromebooks is a mystery to me))  (((I guess Google wants one to buy a Chromebook AND an Android device, thereby increasing Google's bottom-line considerably))).;All-in-all this Chromebook is pretty good, not too bad.CONS: One cannot use any apps other than those in Chrome WebStore (I hear through the Grapevine that Google is \"working\" on permitting one to use a few apps outside those in the Chrome WebStore, but Google seems always to be \"working\" on problems, with few real solutions; This Acer Chromebook does not support Bluetooth, but some Chromebooks do:  Dropbox almost sometimes works on Chrome OS (almost sometimes), while Dropbox works very well on just about everything else (even works OK on Windows 8); This Acer's keyboard is pretty good, but the touchpad makes a loud objection when being tapped (I don't like being tapped either, but I'm not a computer touchpad); The keyboard on this Acer Chromebook is not lighted, making it impossible to see in low-light circumstances (never mind in bed next to my Sweety-Pie at night, since I have to have an external light on, which makes Sweety-Pie not happy): I don't think any Chromebooks have lighted keyboards, but maybe some do;  The battery lasts only about two hours with normal use, not the claimed LOOONG TIME:OK. Not Too Bad, Not Too Good. Just OK.BUT THE REAL KICKER IS; I have yet to determine ANYTHING I can do with the Chromebook that I cannot do with just using the Chrome Browser on any computer (except spending $$$$$$$$$ for yet another electronic \"thing\" to have around!

CHROMEBOOK NONTOUCH IS STILL BEST VALUE FOR YOUR DOLLAR!First you all, it's easy to judge my POV as being disingenuous. Vast majority of Chromebooks users will no doubt view me this way but before writing me off, I'm just like you! Originally a googler user on a Netscape browsers since 1996! Google continues to push innovation year after year, Chromebooks are no exception. One of the goals they had with Chromebook was connecting the lower class to the Web.To do this they engineered a Browser like OS(chromeOS). Software with low resource requirements in keeping prices down. Customarily  to get online needed a $600laptop  but mid 2011 google changed that with Chromebook @ $200!before all that ,the tech companies tried this as well! The industry created a new category called \"netbooks\" laptops 2007. Cheap but slow, a deal breaker! WHY? because the technology wasn't there yet.  Thus, we the consumer market correlated the terms NETBOOKS CHEAP Laptops = unusable SLOW.  LOL  Chromebooks changed all that a few years ago. Finally a cheap but fast machine at a fraction of a price are now at the hands of the budget conscious buyers. Is it a full working laptop? Definitely not. But it's perfectly fine for people needing to browse the internets... at least for now.Then another \"cause and effect\" shift in innovation occurred in the industry.  \"Cause\" > MOBILE devices boom, \"EFFECT\" > Faster Tech evolution.INTEL & AMD's new SoC and APU chips. To the novice readers, those two companies are the brain power of the industry.  AND the latest shift in innovation occurred late (October) 2013, higher level of processing power paved way reengineered \"Netbooks\"* to match Chromebooks affordability but offering users usability a full functionality of Windows OS and not just a Browser backboned OS(ChromeOS). The Technology finally caught up.11-14\" Touch Laptops w/ advanced SoC/APU based notebooks from various OEM are bringing back \"NETBOOK\" category to life. These was what Asus EeePC shoud have been in 2008.  But unfortunately, our frustrating experience of NETBOOKS in years past is hard to forget, the damage has already been done.  Unless you're curious enough to give it another go...and i did.Honestly I didn't expect much but I was shocked.  All i can say is you dont need$700 to have a fast windows... its possible on a $380 and bonus its a touch screen notebook!  Granted the notebook i used had a post October 2013 APU variant.I was doing my research i found these (for the EQUAL PRICE),(update new No.1) HP Touchsmart 11$335 HP Pavilion 11-e015nr TouchSmart 11.6\" Touch Screen - AMD Elite Quad-Core A6-1450(06/01/2013) / 4GB DDR3 / 320GB HD / Windows 8 64-bit OS or from another vendor HP Pavilion 11-e015nr TouchSmart 11.6\" Touch Screen Laptop Notebook - AMD Elite Quad-Core A6-1450 / 4GB DDR3 / 320GB HD / Webcam & Microphone / No Optical Drive / Windows 8 64-bit OS  Pros: Quadcore A6-1450  SoC are usually in notebooks at +$450 category but for HPs asking $350ish ?

My award for \"Out of the box performance king\" is this new Acer V5 with A6-1450/6GB Ram notebook.  (thanks to amazon reviewer \"H\" for pointing me to this)  NOTE: Lenovo Ideapad 14\" at $450 is equally great spec. product down this list.$346 Dell Inspiron 11 i3137-3751sLV, Intel Celeron 2955U Processor (2M Cache, 1.4 GHz), 10/01/2013 ,4thgen/Haswell) 2 GB DDR3,500 GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive 11.6-Inch Touchscreen LaptopPROS: I ranked this Dell on top of the list because newer and fastest CPU on the list, has top end 500GB HD, CONS: but sacraficed with only 2GB ram, reports of poor screen quality!

But i believe you get more bang for your dollar with the Dell on top of this list(but you have to add $60/ 8GB ram. Although for out of the box performance the Asus Q200 wins w/o upgrades.I got the ToshibaNB15T,  it has wireless AC (for upgrade in internet speed) feature not much seem at this price bracket and upgraded to 8GB ram. TIP:  Visit Lenovo,Asus,HP,Dell,Toshiba websites and research their latest budget model lines as those models will have the must updates CPUs in them. Dont relay on Amazon's 3rd party sellers cause i discovered that more than +/-70% of laptops being sold  here are outdated as i did my research.for +/- $350 netbooks are so available for consumers looking for quick value notebook. And full working compute solution not just a Web Browser disguised as a OS. and BTW all those free Apps on Chromebooks can be used on any Chrome browser running in a Windows notebook, so wouldn't that already defeat the purpose of Chromebooks?Let's compare, I hope you all know that installing a Chrome browser in a pc and running the google apps within the Chrome browser in essence owning chromebook for free ?Plus you don't have to handicap your self w/ limited productivity options on ChromeOS.BUT IF ALL YOU HAVE IS $200, AND ALL I WANT TO IS BROWSE THE INTERNET AT HOME.
