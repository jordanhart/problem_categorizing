I've only had it a couple weeks, but so fat everything is great!  I am really liking Windows 8, and how it works with this touch screen.  The processor seems fast.  The only complaint I would have, is that the edges of the laptop seem a little sharp when using the keyboard.  My other laptop is a HP, and it I well rounded on the edges.  It's not sharp enough to cut you, but it just seems to me, it should have been rounded off a little.", "Date": "March 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Overall I am happy with my purchase", "Author": "Susan J Curry", "ReviewID": "R3ORE60BJ8L52J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like everything about this laptop EXCEPT the display. It is rather dull and hard on the eyes, Adjusting the brightness does not help.Having a smartphone helped me adjust to Windows 8. Setup was easy and I like the speed of the computer. I love the 8G of memory and the super big hard drive. I like the built in DVD drive, that means one less accessory to buy and carry around.Because of the less than optimal screen display, I give it 4 stars rather than 5", "Date": "May 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic machine with great build quality", "Author": "Comp-Freak", "ReviewID": "R2FQNH9S96H3EF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is another best machine I have ever used.

I booted it up, followed the prompts to configure, then loaded Java and updated McAfee, which required a restart. The machine would not boot back up. After spending 30 minutes with Lenovo tech support, who tried to tell me that I must have corrupted the operating system (I used to work software support myself, so I know the tricks), I boxed it back up and I'm returning it to Amazon. The only positive that I can say is that Amazon's return policy is easy and painless (so far). I won't buy another Lenovo because of the condescending attitude of their tech support.", "Date": "April 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Screen color is not good.. :(", "Author": "Rakesh Kumar Raushan", "ReviewID": "R23BK6WCNYJDUJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The screen appear very dull and after working of one hour my eyes stated paining and dont wanna more see my laptop screen.
