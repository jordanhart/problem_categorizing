I could go on and on about the slow boot time, the faulty track pad, etc, but the real concern is the overall craftsmanship.  My laptop about a year old and is on its last legs.  The titanium shell has shifted, and has killed the disc drive in the process.  The whole laptop looks like its falling apart.  Today I plugged in the power adapter and saw sparks!  It seems that the adapter is arcing with the metal shell.  Most of the time, it either shorts out, or the sparks fly for only a minute before it either decides to charge or not.  And, for the record, it is true what they say about the Lenovo customer service... Terrible.  They want you to send your laptop to them at your expense for at least 2 weeks just for a diagnosis of their faulty hardware.  If mine doesn't burn the place down in the next couple weeks, its destined to become a boat anchor.  I smell lawsuit on the sparking issue!", "Date": "December 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY DIRECTLY FROM LENOVO!!", "Author": "CNKirby", "ReviewID": "REN46V61CL4P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "To all who are considering ordering from Lenovo directly --- DO NOT!! You have been warned. I originally ordered a Z570 i5 on June 18th. It wasn't until July 10th (after many phone calls, emails and LIES FROM LENOVO REPS) that I finally found out that the configuration I ordered had sold out and they wouldn't be making any more of them. I was then offered two substitute laptops (both with inferior specs -- one even had \"Better graphics\" where the graphics card information should have been). I refused both offers and finally said that I would like to upgrade to the U400 i7 for the same cost or I was going to cancel the order. I was told that would be fine and that it would be put on \"the priority list\". The back and forth with the foreign reps ate up another few days. By this time the ship date on the website for the U400 said July 18th. I said fine and was given a new order number. Checking the order status a couple days later showed a ship date of the 19th. One more day, no big deal. The 19th comes and goes, then the ship date changes to the 23rd. Now I am being told the 3rd of August due to LCD supply issues. So almost 2 months to even get a laptop to ship. Its not worth the hassle having to deal with Lenovo directly. I have loved their products for many years (starting back when they were IBM products) and have been a loyal customer. No longer. Sad for them. I own a technical services/consulting company and have also recommended their products to my clients, family and friends. I can easily account for hundreds if not thousands of sales through my company and my customers. All that good faith gone in a matter of weeks. I am going to wait until the 3rd of August to see if my laptop actually ships. But only because I am getting it for about 60% off. If it ships then MAYBE Lenovo could still retain a portion of my business (but only through other 3rd party suppliers).", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lenovo U400", "Author": "Richard M.

I didn't purchase the lenovo laptop from amazon. I actually purchased directly from lenovo. I bought the i7 500g model.Positive; So far everything is working fine. Boot up time is acceptable and it is quite fast. Also, it runs cool to the touch. Finally, I've had no problem with the battery and connectivity at my house or a friendNegative; I haven't figured out how to type and not touch the track pad. I've just disabled it and I'm working with a mouse. Also, the cd/dvd runs loudConclusion; Overall I give it 4 stars. However I want to say I've only had the laptop since 4/19/12.

The only issue I had along the way was the wifi signal but after tweaking the network card a little bit (as instructed on the lenovo forum, there are several options to play around with) it started working just great. It seems that the defaults on the wifi card are set on minimum of requirements in order to preserve battery life. Once you undo these settings it will work just right.After 18 months I can still get 4.5-5hours of battery life, of course wifi off and low brightness, but you can still watch a movie or do some typing. The case is still shiny with no dents or scratches as when I bought it.One annoying thing is that for some reason it takes a minute to connect to a wifi network after waking up.Other than that I don't even think of changing it anytime soon.

I ordered the laptop on the Second day of February and with her peaches and cream attitude to sell me the Z500 , my Sales rep did everything in her power to please me. Or so I thought . The Sales Rep assured me that my Levovo Z500 would be delivered no later tha February 5th , 2013 . Well I waited for about ten days and checked the status on line. Lo and behold The online status of the build of my Lenovo 500 was expected to be complete by December 2013 and delivered by January 2014 .I understand the Newest Computer may experience delays in production , however I also expect to be kept up to speed about my delivery . In this instance there was absolutely \"\"No\"\" communication  from Lenovo to me regarding production or any delays . I had to physically go into the website and find the information . The number and contact link that Lenovo has posted to contact customer service is also bougus. So my opinion of this copmpany is at best a joke . Horrible Service , Un professional service by Sales Rep , Totally unacceptable delays etc . etc. etc .  Please folks , If you are in the market for a new laptop , find another brand and a company that is reliable as ,  Lenovo should be No One's choice .

This is a known issue with several Lenovo models, but they will not or cannot do anything about it.The keyboard is a little too small, particularly the right hand shift key.One of the USB ports stops working, and Lenovo says the only way to fix it is to do a complete one-button computer reset, which wipes out everything I have loaded or done. I suspect this could be accomplished with a bios reset, but they are not interested. They just tell me to do the reset and hang up.The touchpad is too easily activated by the slightest touch.The battery has half the life they claim, and least when it is struggling with its weak wi fi receiver, and cannot be replaced by the user. that rules out carrying a spare battery. Nor is a replacement battery available to anyone but an authorized Lenovo service facility.All of this is particularly disappointing because this Lenovo was bought as an upgrade to supplement our 2006 Lenovo, which has never had a problem. Not one. Fortunately, I was able to replace its elderly battery myself a while back at a reasonable cost myself.", "Date": "January 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "great computer!!!", "Author": "jazzy", "ReviewID": "R3AZ4EDUDY64XU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This a great cheap computer for gaming!!! i bought it over 4 months ago and i am so far completely satisfied.", "Date": "November 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dont buy this", "Author": "Cristobal", "ReviewID": "R2M77KLBTQIVU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this lenovo via amazon because it was recommended by a lot of tech blogs.
