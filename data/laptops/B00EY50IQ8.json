It works perfectly for a high school workload and just for normal use! I've found myself using the trackpad more than the touchscreen but it's still a pretty neat feature! It's also very nice to carry around!", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for a teacher", "Author": "TeacherProfessor", "ReviewID": "RF05OFOCIMSZW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop because the hp laptops that our school provides us are garbage.  I installed smart board programs and lots of other educational software and the computer works great. It is perfect for what I need it for. I use trend micro antivirus software as I feel it is top of the line. With this software installed I have NO issues with viruses or spyware. If you are a student, teacher, or parent I would highly recommend this product as a less costly alternative to some of the other flashy touch screen laptops that are out there.  I purchased gateway because my previous gateway laptop lasted over 10 years! The only reason I had to replace that one was because I continually picked it up by the screen and it ruined the hardware and wiring.", "Date": "May 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Window 8 is a big drawback...", "Author": "Chris Bevers", "ReviewID": "R136J9H83G1UGJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had this notebook for a month now.  I'm very satisfied, overall, but I can't get past how clunky Windows 8 and 8.1 are.  Perhaps I'm old fashioned, but I find the interface to be dumbed down to an absurd level; in fact, it's so dumbed down that at times I just can't understand some of it until I step back and approach an issue as a child would.  Learning to power down the machine was a research project (you have to find the power widget and turn it off using the touch screen or mouse).I spend much of my time on this notebook using the older legacy interface.  Switching back and forth using the touchscreen is quick and easy.The games interface is also very juvenile, assuming that I want to share my FreeCell time with others of my ilk online... yawn.On the plus side, the notebook is lightening fast!  Turn it on and you can log in almost instantly.  It runs very cool, even on my lap, although I generally use a cooling pad in normal use.  The current version of Norton anti-virus (installed) is far more useful than the versions I've been saddled with on previous notebooks.  Also, there was a surprise bonus of $25 on the App Store.I've always liked Gateways builds, even the current contracted versions.  Not a bad purchase, but Microsoft's poor Windows 8 interface keeps it from being a good or great purchase.", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "it is a good value", "Author": "Herbert T Irvin", "ReviewID": "RZUQOJSZIWNFP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "it is fast, and reliable. still getting the hang of it. trying to adjust to the newer format. many easy apps", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Poor Customer Service", "Author": "Joe Falcone", "ReviewID": "R3B8MVAQ26B8XU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Stay away from Gateway. - Received laptop with two separate issues discovered.First received wrong power cord for US and Gateway Customer Service insisted I received the correct power cord and that I had to buy an adapter.  Had to talk to supervisor to get correct part shipped - took 3 - 5 days to receive.Second issue just discovered is that the sd card plastic cover is missing.  Contacted gateway customer service and again told this model does not ship with cover.  How can they leave an opening in the laptop for dirt.  Received the same series laptop with a bigger display from HSN two weeks ago and the plastic cover was included.  The answer for everything is that it comes that way.  To make matters worse communication was very difficult due to the representatives not being fluent in English.
