No optical drive, which is nice - my old laptop had an optical drive, but never once did I use it, it only adds weight to the laptop.The track pad is also very nice - just like the one you see on Macbook, you can use two fingers to swipe the web page up and down and four fingers to trigger background apps/programs.It also comes with Windows 8. Win 8 is very handy to use, love the Metro interference.Sound quality is great, it's loud and clear.One thing tough, becasause it's black color, finger prints are easily shown.Overall, I highly recommend this laptop, given it's low price and high quality!", "Date": "March 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great laptop", "Author": "Xiaoxiao Yin", "ReviewID": "RGKATLVIFG5CK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop equipped with Pentium 2020M.

It is very light and thin and looks great! It doesn't come with an optical drive but that is as advertised and doesn't bother me any way. (External optical drives can be as cheap as $10) Machine stays very cool even when I played a decent sized game on it for a couple hours! Bought originally for work and school and it has made me life 10x easier. I have and will continue to recommend to friends and family! Great buy!", "Date": "July 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Light weight, Fast and confortable", "Author": "D\u00e9bora and Jes\u00fas", "ReviewID": "R1RY2LJEXABY1J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Asus X501A works very well. Starting Windows 8 is really fast (but I have to say I don't like at all).  Its very light weith and includes Numeric Keyboard.  The screen shows greatest images, and sounds really good.  The batery charged works 6 hours or more.Also I have to write, this notebook doesn't generate heat, works really fresh and practically quiet.Considering price, its a great great deal.", "Date": "April 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop", "Author": "William Wells", "ReviewID": "RM5F9S2IJWMG2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "PROsMuch thinner than I thought it would beMuch bigger screen than expectedRespond and runs programs quick.Starts up and shuts down really fastBattery lasts a long time.CONsWindows 8...
