Davis \"JED\"", "ReviewID": "RUN4HLVCKW9B7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "From the moment I brought the computer home, it has crashed, noting a DCP watchdog violation. I have spent three months on the pone with tech people. Hours of attempted solutions have consumed days. No one has a clear understanding of the problem and each new tech reads an instruction manual and guesses at what to do to fix it. Finally, they told me to send it in so engineers can look at it, though Lenovo admits no one knows what to look for. Instead, I persuaded Office Depot to replace the computer. The new one has the identical problem. Lenovo says send it in. But this would mean being without the computer for 7 to 10 days with little expectation that the engineers will return it having fixed the problem. I walked out of the store with a computer that the manufacturer says I need to send across the country before it will work correctly.
