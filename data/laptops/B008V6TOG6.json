Got it as a christmas present and it's fast, the screen is a great size and perfect for movies in HD quality. Fast enough to play games and enough memory for tens of thousands of songs and hundreds of hours of videos - not even close to running out. Definitely a bargain for the price!The review giving it one star is ridiculous since it has nothing to do with the product - just the fact the person got the wrong item..", "Date": "May 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Update - received refurbished unit, not new", "Author": "GENE HANNAN", "ReviewID": "RQLTHL6XRLRCA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The unit was delivered with less memory and a smaller hard drive than advertised.  I kept it as it was still adequate for my purposes, but this might be an issue for others.I selected this model for features such as size, sturdiness, maintainability, included optical drive, matte screen with a more square aspect ratio than most current models, and Linux compatibility.  I've only been using it a few weeks, but other than the discrepancies noted above I'm quite pleased.Update - I hadn't noticed at the time I wrote the above, but the unit is refurbished, not new.  The only indication is a small sticker on the bottom.  I don't see anything in the ad indicating this to be the case.  I now regret not spending a few dollars more to buy directly from Dell.", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "No software keys", "Author": "Mark R.

With a perpetually no-nonsense design and solidity that rivals even the fiercest opponents, it\u2019s one of the first places many businesspeople look when considering a primary machine. And rightfully so; not many notebooks exist which hail from such a glistening lineage of enterprise-grade dependability.CaseEmbracing the mantra of preserving what works, Dell has left well enough alone in nearly every aspect of the E5430\u2019s construction. You\u2019ll find a virtually identical design to that of its elder (the E5420), and considering our overwhelmingly positive feedback for that aspect of it, there isn\u2019t much room for concern with what largely qualifies as a component-level update.The first thing to note is that the casing, while again, not as heavy-duty or high-quality as the front-running E6XXX models, is still predominantly solid. The first clue the E5430 offers in this regard is its considerable weight. At 2.51 kg, this is a far cry from a featherweight ultraportable.ConnectivityThe Latitude E5430 provides a comfortable selection of expansion ports. Headlining are two USB 3.0 ports (one of which doubles as an eSATA combo), accompanying two additional USB 2.0 ports, for a grand total of four. Once again, the Firewire port has been dropped from the spec sheet as its appeal continues to wane in the face of USB 3.0\u2019s sweeping superiority.CommunicationLatitude E5430 review unit features a dual-band  Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6205 network adapter, which supports Wi-Fi (up to 300Mbps; 2x2 antenna configuration) and Intel Wireless Display (WiDi). Like the E5530, you\u2019re required to opt in for the Dell Wireless 380 Bluetooth 4.0 LE adapter at the time of configuration thanks to fact that the module is not customer-upgradeable post-purchase. The WWAN options are also identical to that of the E5530, meaning that you can choose a Dell Wireless DW5630 to work with any of the four major carrier networks. Again, bear in mind that for LTE compatibility, you\u2019ll need to go the extra mile and acquire a capable adapter separately, as no option is currently provided for LTE on configure-to-order systems.SecurityThe Latitude E5430\u2019s optional fingerprint reader provides biometric authentication that is also remotely administrable if desired, while TPM 1.2 and smart card enrollment are available for an added cost. Meanwhile, self-encrypting hard drives, which are mainstays in many modern enterprise environments, are also an option.AccessoriesSystem included a standard-sized 90W AC adapter and practically nothing else. Any driver or operating system discs are optionally included for a small additional charge ($3 each at the time of this writing).", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "wrong delivery product", "Author": "Jeronimo", "ReviewID": "R3HKAV2DZ4G4DF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Dear All,i have just received the package tha i have ordered, and found out that i got the wrong product. i bought the highlighted Dell, and what i have received is a DEll Latitude  E5430 14'' LED notebook- intel core i3, and not core i5please advice what i should do to rectify thisBest RegardsJeronimo", "Date": "May 11, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Dell Latitude E5430 14\" LED Notebook - Intel Core i5 i5-3210M 2.50 GHz", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41rGz8O4flL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008V6TOG6"}}
