The keyboard is not slower than other computers, she is just an idiot and can't type properly. I have had no issues with the keyboard on my laptop at all and i use this computer daily. The only gripes i have are that the mouse pad sucks and it is difficult to get windows 8 off this machine without losing functionality. With that being said, if you can stand windows 8 (i am used to it now but it has its annoying \"features\" that take some getting used to) and  learn to live with the mouse pad then this is a great laptop. I bought this as a replacement for my desktop and could not be happier. Performance is amazing, cold boot to login screen is about 10seconds, plenty of ram and fast cpu, etc. For the price and specs you can't go wrong with this laptop.", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Stay away from this computer", "Author": "Judith Sells Ryan", "ReviewID": "R37F1X84LGCE7H", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Ater years of using HPs (and Compaqs before that) I switched to Vaio because they had a convenient screen size, I loved the Vaio experience. However, because they no longer make the 16.4\" laptop I went back to HP, their 17\" option seemed to solve my problem and I had heard good things about the Envy line.To my disappointment and concern, as I will have to purchase something else, this computer is miserable to use. The keypad is slower than the Vaio and the mouse-pad is a nightmare, I have disabled most features and still it does whatever it wants, paints the screen blue for no reason, when I try to right click on a word to change spelling it brings up a menu strip and I have to repeat the operation, when I point and click something, half the time nothing happens until I try two or three times, a real nightmare.I have no doubt that the computer is a good computer as computing goes, but as for easy of use, it is terrible! The problems I have described make me much slower, and the type of work I do depends on speed and output.  I actually compared it by doing the same assignment on the new HP and on the old Vaio.Yes, I can buy a mouse but I work on the road, and a mouse in my case is not really practical.I regret having gone back to HP.J.
