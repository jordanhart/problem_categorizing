There were a few moments where the touchpad went screwy but it always went back to normal. 2 months out of warranty, the ac adapter stopped being recognized so the battery wouldn't charge. I bought a new Dell ac adapter but it didn't read that either. Then I trucked over and bought a new battery - still no luck.  I spent a hugely frustrating 1hr+ on the phone getting bounced around and repeating the same info. One guy told me he would \"test it remotely\" and put me on hold for 45 minutes, saying he was checking things. CLICK. He hung up or got disconnected. Next rep had no record I was even talking to anyone and said they couldn't even test things remotely. I then got passed along to sales guy when I started getting ticked.Sales guy told me it was probably a BIOS update, not the motherboard as everyone has speculated. So I used the new battery to attempt to update the BIOS. BIOS won't update unless battery & ac adapter are plugged in.  In the meantime, the new battery charge is out so I buy yet another battery to attempt this supposed fix. Won't work and can't find google solution that helps so I call again. This time, I'm told you can't update the BIOS unless battery and adapter are plugged in. So I'm in a catch 22 and it still doesn't work. Lovely reps told me I can pay $390 for a new motherboard. Um, no, that makes no sense.  The final straw was the Dell rep offering to help me select a new Dell product. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? My last Dell desktop had to have a motherboard replaced, but that was under warranty.I have since read about many problems with Dell and their mohterboard set ups and issues. Don't worry though, one rep told me she'd pass along the message that they should offer external battery chargers. I'm not sure she'll pass along the message that I'd rather have them work on motherboards that last longer than a year. I am shopping for a new laptop and will never use Dell again.", "Date": "July 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great computer if you don't mind inevitably replacing the motherboard", "Author": "Sarah", "ReviewID": "RZCP6YKAEHLGI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "As with many other reviews I've seen, shortly after the warranty expired my computer suddenly wouldn't turn on, with no warning whatsoever. Upon start up it just gave me a black screen and some loud beeps. I learned that this was a problem with the motherboard, and replacing it out of pocket was too costly for me, so now it's useless. For what it's worth, I almost chose to give more stars than one because the actual functionality of the computer was great before the motherboard randomly went out, but for me that's not enough to justify forking out more cash later on, and more importantly, losing everything on my hard drive. This computer was sold at a great price (I bought it in store for about 400, not sure why it's so much here), but I suggest you save yourself the trouble and spend a little extra now on something that will last, as I wish I had done!EDIT: Tons and tons of people with the exact same situation (motherboard fail after 15 months or less) on the Dell community message boards, and still no official word from Dell on the problem. Obviously this is an error on their part, hopefully they will recall this model. I'd love to hear back after 15 months of use from anyone giving a 5 star review just a few weeks after purchase, I'm almost positive you'll be singing a different tune.", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great price awesome laptop", "Author": "ReZa", "ReviewID": "R3L2IJT245KE7B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this  laptop for almost 2 years and i love it.I bought for about $450.00 at best buy and it fits my needs and does everything i want it to do, games, downloads, videos etc. It has a nice feel to it but its a bit heavy. its great for browsing the web and maybe some occasional gaming.pros-fast and responsivegreat feelperfect for home usecons-not exactly portablea bit heavyI mainly use programs such as adobe after effects, adobe premier, Photoshop, Sony Vegas, and hit-film.its also great for games like, skyrim, fallout new Vegas, Call of duty, and battlefield.so far those are really the only games I've tried on the laptop and they work pretty decently.Overall its a great laptop and i would recommend it to many.", "Date": "June 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Never buy a dell!", "Author": "tanginangdellyan!", "ReviewID": "R2VSNGLEP85YQB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought a new one not too long ago...i was able to use it for 4 months and the lcd started to act crazy (purple spots on screen) and it slows down..shipped it twice to dell for repair got it back and after a day i got the same problem again..they sent me a replacement but a refurbished one..the replacement they sent me didnt last 6 months and they told me that its already out of warranty cause refurbished laptops only have 90 days warranty...i bought the new one 10 months ago and then the one year warranty is voided because it was overlapped by the warranty of the refurbished one?..i even have all the info and receipt of my original purchase including the service tags and some other infos of the laptop and my warranty was voided because they sent me a refurbished one which broke after 6 months of light use..its not even been a year when i purchased my new one and dell gave me the redurbished on the 4th month so i still got 2 months  left of my 1 yr warranty...dell have the worst product and customer service ever..note that i dont even use the laptop for gaming and some other stuff that requires higher hardware requirements...", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent laptop", "Author": "pillowhead94", "ReviewID": "REB909499BX2N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is great.

Obviously not a good laptop for gaming (as other reviews have mentioned), but it is a nice choice for those who want to write some documents, email, and surf the web. I've had no problems with it so far besides the occasional crash(I've had the computer since May), and although it does not have HDMI, I easily fixed that by just taking advantage of its VGA/RGB output. Also, you might want to know that this PC does not support bluetooth, so if you use bluetooth headsets etc, like me, then I would just purchase a bluetooth adapter (there's a couple for less than a dollar here on Amazon).  Overall if you want something for daily casual use, this laptop is a great bargain and a product I would personally recommend!  - Ryan S", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent computer for the price...", "Author": "D.

Its pretty decent but not the best I've had being that I've previously owned a Sony Vaio and Gateway. I use this computer for chatting(including webcam), Microsoft Office, internet and email. You do have some moments where it process slow at times. Also the fan on this computer is loud. Sometimes when I chat on webcam my friends ask me if its a garbage truck outside when its actually the cooling fan on the computer. I also have problems with the touchpad at times which gets  very annoying. (it will move in crazy or opposite directions and I have to restart the pc to get it to work correctly or use an external mouse) I actually like the 3D look the computer has, but like others have mentioned, the entire laptop does have a \"cheap\" feel to it. (it actually feels like a quickly made computer as the commericlas show on TV lol) Overall its pretty average, if you paid more than $300 for it, then you may be kind of dissapointed, if not, you should be pretty much satisfied. I actually liked my Gateway better than this if I'm being honest. I will probably pawn it when I get a new laptop on Black Friday or when i get my income tax return lol ;)", "Date": "October 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "7 Beeps", "Author": "tcrom2", "ReviewID": "R1Q1Z1HVJJJ890", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I too had this issue.

Within 1 month, My hard drive went out-which is a shock to me because it sits on a desk never being jostled or moved much. They try to get me to send in the laptop \"It will take 8 weeks to fix and send back\" to which i responded \"Just send me the hard drive and I will install it myself\". I got the hard drive timely enough and installing it was a nightmare. Take 25 screws out, then pry open the case top, popout keyboard and gently remove its wires, then unclip two other wires. Then of course i found out why the hard drive went out. Dell was too cheap to even include a HDD enclosure, so your hard drive is free floating attached to a sata connector. Everytime you rest your palm in front of the keyboard you are hitting the hard drive. Well needless to say I fixed it and it seemed to work for awhile. Then about two months ago the screen decided to go out. It had up to date drivers, nothing was wrong with the screen (no cracks etc.) it just randomly would go completely black then flicker on and off. My warranty ran out so I just decided i would scrap this computer and upgrade a netbook which seems to out perform this thing.  Never buy another Dell they are he**.P.S.

I have only tried watching 2 DVDs on it2. Now, it is about one year since I bought it. The wireless connect to router is falling off. Forget about download anything. In my house, there are 4 other computers connecting to the same router. One of them is 6 year old Sony NGN250?. It is 2GB and very slow. Still, the Sony machine connects to the rounter. But this Dell machine cuts off wireless connection, more and more often.3. I had BestBuy Geek Squard upgrade it to 8GB, the max memory it can handel. I spent $39, because you want to upgrade memory on this machine? Forget about it, because you run huge risk of screwing up your keyboard and other tiny wires. All the other machines I have, HP, Acer, Sony, and Toshiba, you just slide open and slike the new memory stick in. You are done. This Dell computer is becoming a computerized car. It is just so component unfriendly. So anything Dell says about this machine's upgrade potential, you need to seriously think about DIY. I bought it ~$300. Now the labor cost for installing memory is 13% on top of the purchase price.4. Is it really 3GB installed on the original machine? The BestBuy guy rolled his eyes and said he never heard off 3GB. The two sticks being replaced show 1 GB each. Is this a ....fraud case here?Not only my confidence in Dell, but my trust in Dell, is fading.

Look, I have had my Inspiron for over a year with NO problems whatsoever.  Sure, it doesn't have HDMI... and the processor is less than stellar..... what do you expect for the price?  Don't you people read the specs before you buy??Why the four stars.... came with three gigs of RAM, not four. Accessing the RAM (upgraded to 8 gigs) means taking the laptop apart. I wouldn't recommend upgrading unless you are somewhat tech savvy.  The LCD screen is okay, but you can see the pixels rather easily.  It is true, it does have a \"cheap\" feel to it, but so far not one crack. As for fingerprints??? Forgetaboutit!  The \"3D\" finish takes care of that and I happen to like it.  I don't like the fact all three USB ports are on the left side of the machine.  Kinda makes it tough on righties when all outlets are on the left.Pros: Bright Screen!! Cheap (price) Runs all of my programs well. It looks good. (have received compliments) The Full Size Keypad is nice... no sticking keys, and very quiet while typing. SD card reader, DVD ROM, AMD Vision all are amazing.  WiFi is picked up very quickly.  More than adequate webcam, and surprising sound from the built in speakers. (as laptops go)  Battery life is not bad... on average I get 2.5 to 3 hours running at full power.  I LOVE the 3D finish. The 4.1 Windows Experience is for running Aero... all other numbers are 5.3 or better. (Including Gaming)  Not too bad for a cheap laptop.  This laptop WILL game, just don't expect high frame rates.Cons: All USB ports on the left side along with the power cord and ethernet port.  The laptop is HEAVY.  The cooling fan sounds like a 747 is taking off, BUT it rarely comes on unless you are really running it hard so not a HUGE con.  The LCD Screen is not the best, in fact I was surprised to see the pixels.All in all for the price, it is well worth it.  Just be sure to upgrade the RAM.
