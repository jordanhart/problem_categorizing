I'm currently overseas and staying at the Navy Gateway in San Diego. This device is unable to connect to the room's public WIFI! Its crazy. My 5 year old macbook and my android galaxy note3 can connect with no issues at all. But when I go to a place with really strong WIFI, there is no issue at all. So maybe I should just blame the accommodation hah.2. Watching youtube videos of GT70 dominator and dominator pro - they all showed that the laptop has 3 PCI-e (mSATA) slots. I bought Samsung Electronics 840 EVO mSATA 0.85-Inch Solid State Drive MZ-MTE250BW and ZTC Sky Board mSATA to USB3.0 SSD Enclosure Adapter Case - Model ZTC-EN002, did a cloning of the windows and opened up the back of the laptop...Kaboomz - no PCIe slots. Just 2 2.5 inch SATA bays. Back to square one... bought this Syba 2.5-Inch SATA to mSATA SSD External USB Storage Device (SD-ADA40077) - hopefully by tomorrow it will be all good.3. Price is good - My total cost for everything was 1399 (laptop) + 220 (above mentioned peripherals). Definitely the cheapest and best performing laptop in its class for USD 1620.4. Update: I installed the mSATA SSD into the Syba adaptor. Removed the 1 GB HDD and installed the SSD. Booted it up. Perfect. Shutdown, reinstalled the HDD into the other SATA slot. Went into bios to disable the 2nd MBR boot. Went into windows, used Samsung Magician software to enable RAPID and best performance on the SSD. Boot up time is like 7-8 secs now. Unbelievably fast.", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing with a few small things", "Author": "mike hedges", "ReviewID": "R11APCBVHOFGNO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "well so far it has been a very amazing experience this laptop is blazing fast, and i still have yet to upgrade to 16gb of ram and a ssd for my os and a few games. On the downside though the keyboard is not supported to the fullest extent, around the d key it goes in a little bit if you type harder than the normal person. On the good side though there are many things to note as well, even with he keyboard not being supported, the keys are very nice to type on and the lighting system is wonderful, bravo to steel series. Another thing the switching of the windows key, now i dont personally like it, but its a good thing to notice before spending 1400 on a laptop, if it would bug you alot dont get it, but i can deal. The trackpad is surprisingly very nice to touch and to use in general, i usually hate trackpads but i love this one. The touch buttons on the top are a nice feature and they look great too. The build quality is rather amazing, the laptop as a whole feels extremely sturdy and overall very nice. The light up logo on the lid is nice too. Now i do have to say the speakers they produce high quality audio and it gets fairly loud for a laptop all while staying crisp in the highs and the small woofer is a nice touch. It does come slightly bloated with software, but i must say i find myself using many of the programs. And you can always delete them as well. Under the hood you have 4 ram slots and 2 HDD bays(that i could see) to work with. That gives you so much room to run i just love it. There are no mSATA bays but why use an mSATA when you can just put in 2 normal size drives?  The charger and computer are very heavy, like 14 pounds together or so. To me that's nothing, but to some it may mean not getting the computer. On some reviews i seen they said the screen was grainy, and to me the screen looks very nice on games tv shows movies etc. I know its not a perfect screen but honestly it looks good and gets very bright. If you have any other questions i would love to answer them :) Oh and i asked support about the Ram they had pre installed and they were very helpful, its nice to have good customer service(as far as i can tell)", "Date": "April 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "A beast of a machine.", "Author": "Tony", "ReviewID": "R1VGLJ911D86W7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're looking for a replacement desktop that will run any game on ultra, then this isn't the laptop for you. If you're looking for a good gaming laptop at a reasonable price that will play all games on AT LEAST medium settings. I'm happy to say your wait is over. This laptop is a beast, before I purchased the MSI gt70 dominator I was looking at ASUS ROG G750JM for 100 dollars less. But I decided for 100 dollars more I'll get the 870m and a better CPU. Now there are a few things people worry about with this laptop.1. Heat - I have played Skyrim on ultra and Smite on ultra so far. The heat was not hot and the base of the laptop was not hot at all. It was relatively cool, and if the system does over heat, there is a button on the computer that puts the fans on overdrive.  So heat should not be an issue.2. Build quality- The build quality is something I was worried about, apparently MSI is known to have bad build quality? Well i'm glad to say this is not the case, the build quality seems great, no complaints, everything is nice and sturdy.3. Power - This machine is a BEAST. Plain and simple, it ran skyrim at ultra and smite at ultra. Everything you'd expect from a 1400 dollar gaming laptop is here.The one complaint I did have was the mouse, this isn't a problem for me since I bought an etekcity mouse for 12 dollars (Also an excellent mouse) So the mouse built into the laptop wasn't a problem, and you shouldn't be using that mouse if your going to be gaming on this machine.Overall this is a great purchase and I regret nothing. Get it, now.I will update this review after a month of use and then a year. If any problems arise I will post it here.", "Date": "May 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "A rocky start, but now smooth sailing.", "Author": "codifier \"The purpose of our lives is to be h...", "ReviewID": "R35BIIHB5OZIO6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I looked at a lot of gaming laptops trying to get  the best bang for my buck since I didn't want to spend more than fifteen-hundred on one.  I finally boiled it down to between this, the ASUS ROG G750, and the MSI GE60 laptops.  In the end the tipping point was the video card as the 870m is the highest end mobile card unless you want to pay about five-hundred more for the current flagship the GTX 880m.  Apparently the 870 is noticeably better performing than the 860 (according to notebook check) which all the other gaming laptops have at this price point.  The processor is roughly equivalent to competing models, and while this model has less RAM it still has plenty and can more can be added later relatively inexpensively.Unfortunatelyl the first one I got was faulty and had to be returned as it randomly locked up whenever the video card was ran even moderately hard no matter the game or drivers used.  Luckily Amazon shipped a replacement immediately and this one has been a beast.  So far I have thrown Age of Wonders 3, Company of Heroes 2, Planetside 2, and Dawn of War 2 (a lot of sequels!) with max settings and still get above 50fps.  While none of these are bleeding edge games designed to push your card to the limits I am very satisfied with the performance on a mobile platform with modern games especially Planetside where things get hectic in large firefights.The sound is pretty great (I have never had a sub-woofer inside a laptop before), the keyboard is nice on the hands while being responsive and I especially like the amount of control you have over the back lit keyboard colors even if it is minor in the grand scheme of things.  The touchpad kind of sucks but that's because they blow in general and there isn't much help for that.  It does however automatically disable whenever it detects another pointing device which can be overridden by a handy physical key near the pad.  The screen is high-resolution and looks great out of the box and I haven't had to adjust anything yet.  I find the casing aesthetically pleasing, solid, and a bit flashy which a gaming rig aught to be.  The only 'downside' I have found so far is as a 17.3\" gaming laptop this thing is not light or small, and the power brick is the size of my foot.  If you find those characteristics unacceptable then you're shopping for the wrong laptop.Given the performance you get for the price I find the MSI GT70 to be an outstanding bargain.", "Date": "April 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Watch out for unadvertised refurbished product", "Author": "suellen", "ReviewID": "R14PTSHREUHJM2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ordered this laptop last weekend. First thing I noticed was that the box had been opened. The sticker to seal it was dirty and wrinkled and not very sticky anymore. The emblem on the back of the laptop was all scratched up. There were fingerprints on the inside of the laptop near the keyboard. And on top of that, there was no clear protective tape to take off over the keyboard/camera lens. After a few hours of use and setup I also realized the right side speaker didn't work, but being that it was Saturday there wasn't much I could do about it.Here's the real kicker. My first move was to contact MSI about the issue with the speaker. Found out through them that this standard warranty doesn't even cover shipping. So the representative from MSI was completely content telling me that the laptop I purchased with a problem would have to be shipped in for repair, and I would have to pay to ship it to them. Pretty ridiculous.This same representative helped me to register the laptop, The serial number on the outside of the box where it instructs you to look didn't work and i had to actually open the battery port to pull it off there. The best part about calling MSI about my problems was that this representative was able to tell me that my serial number had previously already been used to register. So, just as i suspected the minute i started to open this laptop, Amazon had got a hold of this as a return, not fixed it, not properly repackaged it, then they sold it to me as a brand new laptop. Funny part about that is they have a link on this page to see refurbished deals for other MSI products, but i didn't realized i had inadvertently clicked that link. HINT: I DIDN'TDefinitely keep your eyes open if you purchase this or anything else from Amazon for that matter. Clearly they think they can get away with selling people damaged and used products advertised as new.I Will say that once I got a hold of customer support the lady didn't question my complaint whatsoever, and I'm supposed to get another \"brand new\" laptop tomorrow. We'll see about that.", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "my rig", "Author": "daniel", "ReviewID": "RBS8NFBWZ3V03", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "powefull and beautiful machine for playing all gameseasy to usequick deliverygood performancesatisfied customerwin 8.1 good", "Date": "June 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "great performance, can not upgrade HDD without vioding warrenty", "Author": "Zachary Anderson", "ReviewID": "R1ERHK5IVC2CQF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Hardware and performance is great.
