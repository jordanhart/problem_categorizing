{"Reviews": [{"Title": "MSI GT70", "Author": "Lam Hoang", "ReviewID": "R20Y7LXZRZLNYY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this item through amazon and was also shopping around other websites like newegg and xoticpc. The reason I bought it on amazon was the list price was $1.399 like most of the other websites , but on newegg the final price came out to be 1500+ with 50 dollar shipping. I paid $1410.00 USD no tax and 10 dollars for 2 day shipping which was an incredible deal.I did alot of researh before buying this machine and could not find a better laptop with powerful specs at this price. Other laptops with a GTX 750m + and a 4th gen processor was above $1800+. SO far I have run Hitman Absolution, Bioshock Infinite, Borderlands 2, and Sleeping dogs. All on ULTRA settings. The laptop does get hot because of the one fan, but I have a small air filter fan that I leave on the side and blows cold air to the back of the laptop which helps alot.Also, about 3days after using the machine I did a regular boot up the Laptop encountered a problem with Windows configuration, it was stuck at 15% for around 20 minutes and 30% for another 20 minutes then finally booted up. I read on MSI forums and this is a common problem, I fixed it by using these steps.1.  Click Start then type CMD into the search area to locate the command prompt (cmd.exe).2.  RIGHT CLICK the command prompt icon and choose \"Run As Administrator\"  - you must have administrator rights.3.  In the command prompt type in \"sfc /scannow\"4.  Make a sandwich.  This is important.  A well fed trouble-shooter is an effective trouble-shooter.5.  Restart your computer.After doing this the boot time to desktop is around 10 - 15 seconds.I have never used windows 8 before, I still try to avoid it. What I do is just click on desktop and use it like a regular windows 7 platform so I hardly ever notice that im using a different OS.Overall I love this laptop and it is a beautiful machine. I wish I had the dragon edition because it looks so cool. 5***** .", "Date": "July 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "This machine is amazing, and I put in Win 7", "Author": "Mathew Kestner", "ReviewID": "R3CR7CMQUBRB6H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will upload some pictures to show this laptop and what it looks like, along with how large the charger block for it is. For an i7 and 770m, this machine is a great price(1300).The box is quite quite heavy. A lot of this is from the weight of the charger block, which is also large. Though this is a desktop mid-level gaming machine equivalent, the charger blocks size makes sense. The charge block also has rubber feet, which is helping it stay securely at the edge of my desk while the cords run like vines down the side, which I know from experience with my now sold Macbook Pro that it would slide off the edge. But again, this block sits securely there.The Windows 8 issue. I first inserted the battery, and sat with the laptop on the box and opened it up for an initial overview without plugging it in the wall. This took so long I lowered the screen and used my desktop computer while I waited. The included 5400RPM off-brand 1TB hard-drive is extremely slow. It took nearly 15 minutes for it to \"initialize\" whatever Windows 8 needed before I was able to being adding a user name in the introduction screen. So the Windows 8 headache ended there, in my mind. After nearly 3 hours of reading nothing useful on the internet and random attempts to install Ubuntu or Windows 7, this machine finally took my own method of accepting the Windows 7(medicine for how reluctant this machine was because of the awful UEFI). I won't go into detail, but the pictures will show my success with installing Windows 7 on this Windows 8 \"only\" machine. All of the drivers I needed were included not on the CD from the box, but as downloads from the MSI website support for this model. I installed the 770m drivers myself from the nVidia webtsite.Nothing showing in Device Manager as unknown, and all is operating very smoothly.I have removed the 1TB drive as the boot drive, and am using a 120GB Vertex 4 as my main boot drive. The 1TB now serves as a storage only unit, which is extremely slow so far in my experience, with it averaging 28mb/s transfer speed with large files(50gb of video), and it is still transferring as I type this. I am going to make an attempt at installing Ubuntu on this machine with a different SSD in the 1TB HDD slot, if successful I will add the photos along with the Windows 7 photo showing this machine free of 8's shackles.This machine runs cooler than my previous Macbook Pro 2010 i7(1st gen) which also had graphics switching, which is impressive. The fan option that reduces the machines heat gets quite loud, which isn't an issue for me. I sold my Macbook Pro and was able to purchase this without hardly investing any money, as the Macbook had strangely high resale which I accepted with a smile. So going from 1st gen i7 to 4th gen, and nVidia 330gt to a 770m with minimal money? Yeah, sign me up anyday. Especially when there isn't a lock on having Windows 8 on this machine like I thought it was going to be.The additional software initially included with the Windows 8 installation was awful. A bunch of Norton garbage, and a bunch of other strange random programs I don't even know what they did which classifies them as completely unnecessary. WinZip coming to mind, which I replace with the free and powerful 7-zip.The mousepad works exactly on 7 as you would demand it to. On 8 it had a goofy right side 1.5cm area that you would have to swipe to get a sidebar from windows with a start and settings option in it. Inside 7, i was able to remove all strange effects and allow it to replicate the smooth scrolling most people are used to with the 2 fingers.So far, with chopping Windows 8 out of this machine and stuffing 7 in its place, I couldn't be happier. I have yet to run an index score, but I will update this review with an index score comparing it to my 3770k desktop machine. And also after I will update with a few words about how it performs while playing my steam games, which I am going to have to install on an external USB 3.0 case for my 3.5\" Spinpoint f3. Other games such as league of legends I don't play often, but will give a play and return with that also. Though we all know it is going to perform well, I only make this a task as I run 99% of my time on a large 55\" TV and I want to see how the mobile laptop performs. I shortly am leaving to China for a year and so I need to know if this laptop performs as I demand it to before the trip.The airplane button will help me, and it immediately cuts out Bluetooth and wi-fi radios, which I like. The one touch cooling fan I said was very loud, but I don't care, and it works, but I will run a cooling pad anyway because china is very hot. The backlighting is very nice for the keyboard, and it also has the option to only backlight the left half of the keyboard, which I will like for night gaming. A G button on the right side, which pulls up quick options for power, wifi, and a few other things.Overall, since adding the SSD(10 second boots from off, though a silly network boot option always slows it up, it must be looking for Win 8) and having it run with Windows 7 instead of Windows 8, this machine is very rock solid. Very fast and responsive, and the wifi is nearly as fast in terms of ping as my wired desktop. I also added 4gb of extra Hyper-X 1600mhz RAM which I found on amazon for an amazing $20, so I couldn't pass that up. Machine sees it without a problem, and I now have 12gb ram. The HDD bay that is empty in this machine, comes with a bracket in the accessories for securing the extra HDD or SSD you install into it. The USB 3.0 on this ran my external 500GB WD drive at 120mb/s write during a quick test transfer, so I know that functions as well.Also, and lastly, the CD drive in this machine CANNOT be removed and you CANNOT install a third drive as I wanted to do. The CD drive sata power strip is only half the length of any HDD sata connection, so I wasted my own money with this endeavor of buying the external CD USB case, but not a big deal for me as overall everything is running so well.Thank you for reading the long post, but this is a laptop. I hope this has helped.****Update**** - My desktop has been stripped of its drives as they now are in external cases of varying sizes. The machine has been flawless. The windows index score is at 7.6, due to the CPU. Though my desktops score was 7.7 with an un-overclocked i7-3770k, so I would say that this laptops 4th gen i7 in mobile form is doing quite well. Certainly the desktop can become a skyscraper of performance, but that much need for overclocking isn't going to be until 2 years from now when games actually benefit from how much power these recent generations of iSeries CPUs.I have been chipping at downloading 563GB of steam games. I was having trouble with the USB 3.0 disconnecting just one of my drives randomly and that isn't normal... after a bit of troubleshooting I found some options within the power options that prevent windows for letting the drives utilize a strange USB minimal power option, which I disabled. That was a nice start, but not the issue, it was still randomly disconnecting my USB 3.0 self-powered 1TB drive(not the laptops 1TB drive, a full 3.5\"). The problem boiled down to heat. I haven't used an external case like the one I have, as I just bought it with this laptop, and I was nearly ready to send it back. Though I figured it out, that this drive should be slightly removed from the case and only positioned vertically. All USB problems solved and I can live with the drive being removed from the case slightly as a solution. Also, now that this is solved, I run Steam directly from this 1TB drive and all of my currently installed games have been running flawlessly as well.Playing games! I have been using this to play Boarderlands 2 recently, and I have exact matching settings between this and my desktops(i7-3770, GTX680OC). I seriously forgot I was using this laptop. This proves that nearly 90% of the games I will play will be run as well as my GTX680OC was running them... quite satisfied. When I took my headphones off is when I realized the laptop fan elevated over typical use, but not very loud at all, and that was made me remember I was using the laptop. This machine has been handling itself as a complete desktop replacement thus far, and what a brilliant performance of it all. Blown away, 5 stars, glad I sold the Macbook pro and ultra happy I was able to get the SSD installed and Windows 7 on it. The games I play are all on my 55\" Samsung, and this runs it as main display and the laptop display as secondary, so that way I can enjoy games on my TV like my desktop was setup.Airflow(dissipating heat) is a major major factor for computers, and again it even proved itself a key factor in my external drive. This laptop having the ability to increase fan speeds is a huge bonus. This will certainly increase the life of the computer, if the fan holds out. I also purchased a laptop self powered cooling pad which I will be using all the time while I use this machine outside of air conditioned environments(such as while I am in China for coming months).I purchased along side this a pair of HD280's, and I must admit the sound performance of the cans and the laptops realtek chip has been also pleasing. Though I will say, if you aren't deaf, you can hear the un-shielded realtek chip and all operations carried out make a small amount of noise... though you can hear these noises only when nothing else is playing. If you are playing music/games/videos I don't think you will notice it, and when the volume levels increase above a whisper you can't hear the noises at all. The included Sound Blaster software which I chose to install and try, increased the muffled sounds of a very cheap headset I have laying around. This might prove helpful for people who haven't invested in a nice set of headphones. Also to note is this laptop actually powered my HD650's and these headphones require an amp to have any decent sound. Though it powered them, they are unparalleled when used with my desktops STX. But overall, 5stars for the sound as well.For the windows index:CPU  7.6RAM  7.6GFX  7.7Disk 7.9Really loving this laptop. Worth every last penny.Update 2:After I fixed the USB disconnects, they returned. I put Win 8 back inside to check if it was the 7 version I was using. No, without regard of which version of windows, 8 or 7, they still were happening. A self powered 4Amp USB 3.0 hub has 100% fixed it. Over a month now, and not a disconnect. If other are having this issue, or are curious, the answer is a self powered hub.This is the hub: Plugable 4-Port SuperSpeed USB 3.0 Hub with 4A Power Adapter for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux (VIA VL811 Chipset)", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent performance all-around, Great Design, Awesome gaming performance", "Author": "C.

Great features, Much much less bloatware than Asus.Highly recommend!", "Date": "September 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Super powerful laptop!", "Author": "Davidle1787", "ReviewID": "RPDZPZASE2NLE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Make sure when you're gaming, open the SCM and enable gaming mode! For some reason, it doesn't automatically switch to the optimal settings when I play.I just got done running FRAPS in Battlefield 3 with every setting maxed out and between three runs in the same server, I averaged 73 FPS. I don't have any other graphics intensive games unless someone wants to see my averages on Crysis 1.*Edit* I just played several more rounds in different servers and my averages ranged from 63-80 FPS.I came from a 15.6\" DV6-TQE with a 2630QM + HD6770 @ 1Gb DDR5. Needless to say, this is quite an improvement as far as speed goes.Longevity - The HP lasted around 5-6 hours on normal usage (browsing the web, office programs, watching videos). The GT70 will get about 3-5 hours so carry your chargers, spare battery or external battery pack with you!Screen - It's no comparison since the HP had a reflective 720p screen but this 1080p matte screen is awesome! The viewing angles are great and there is not much reflection (sunlight shines directly at the screen). Luckily, mine came with no dead pixels.Size/weight - Initially, I was apprehensive about purchasing the 17.3\" version and was originally going to buy the GT60 but for $50 more, I couldn't resist and I'm happy I chose this model. My HP laptop was about 6-7lbs with the 9-cell battery upgrade and this is supposedly just under 9lbs. Holding them in my hands, I can't really feel the difference in weight between the two but there definitely is a noticeable size difference. I had (HP laptop and backpacks were stolen) this backpack: Case Logic DLBP 116 16 Inch Backpack and it, unsurprisingly, didn't fit in the laptop slot BUT it did fit into the main slot. I'm currently debating on whether or not I should purchase the same backpack or buy one designed for a 17.3\" laptop.*Edit*I just bought a Case Logic RBP-117 17.3\" laptop backpack and it juuuuust fits in there. It's not a tight fit nor is it a loose it. It's just a bit snug. If you click on my username, you can search for the review.Keyboard - Backlighting is awesome! Yes, there is some color bleeding but since I'm not OCD, it doesn't bother me much. The keyboard, however, is laid out a bit strangely. It's nice that the Windows button is now on the right side so that it doesn't interfere with gaming (never did on my old laptop or desktop keyboard) but the backspace, 0 and right shift button got shortened and the arrow keys are positioned in such a way that you would need to look down to place your fingers correctly or feel for the slightly larger space between the up arrow and the 1 key. My thumb usually rests right under the 1 key but now that space is used for the right arrow key. Lastly, there are two keys for the \"\\ |\" key. The other key is to the right of the space bar and I cannot make any sense of this key.Operating system - Some people hate it, some people like/love it. I hate it and all the bloatware apps it comes pre-installed with. Apparently, Windows decided to ditch the Start Menu because a study of theirs revealed that not many people use the Start Menu key. I use it all the time and I'm quite annoyed that there isn't a factory option to boot up to the standard Windows interface. I've had to \"Pin\" the Command Prompt and Run programs otherwise I'd have to jump through hoops to get to them (I like having a clean desktop and taskbar). I really don't like the idea of adding on a third party program to get the Start Menu back but there's no other choice.Speakers - Not as loud as I thought given the other reviews but they're relatively loud in comparison to other laptops. My HP had a Beats by Dre sound system/speaker setup and they sounded like garbage but I've never liked any of the Beats speakers/headphones in the first place so I could be a tad bit biased here. The Dynaudio speakers are awesome though! It gives a rich sound from such small speakers.Hard drive - Slow as snail balls! $1,500 for a laptop with a 5400rpm drive? No gaming laptop should be crippled like this. It has two storage bays (this specific model), just give us a 500 or 750 GB 7200rpm drive. Most of us will be switching out to SSD's anyway (Samsung 840 Pro being ghosted).Touchpad - It would be nice to have multi-finger gestures. Scrolling down on this laptop requires you to place your finger on the far right (computer set as right handed) and drag down. On my old HP which also used Synaptecs drivers, I could scroll down using two fingers anywhere on the touchpad and swipe downward.*Edit* It wasn't working before but the multi-finger gestures are working now.Palm rest - It does not get hot at all!Noise - Quiet during normal operation and then sounds like a desktop video card with its fans on max with the turbo fan on. It's a gaming laptop, don't expect to be able to game in a library.Network card - Has better reception than my dual band Asus USB adapter (USB-N53).MSI Afterburner doesn't seem to work on this but the Turbo Fan touch button is right there so no big deal.", "Date": "August 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "IMO best Laptop for anything you might want to use it for.", "Author": "Christopher", "ReviewID": "R2VH3J5PLLA9ZM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to express how i feel for this laptop, since I'm a hard core AMD fan boy and the laptop has an i7 Intel processor with the sexy GTX 770M graphics card, that its extremely powerful.I am a Medical Student and i use this beast for studying and also when i have time... gaming... its good for anything you might want to use it, the only bad thing is the weight, but its a factor that does not seem to bother me as much as it would bother somebody else.

I started with the ASUS G750 and then this one. So my research went on for well over four months and given I'm not very computer knowledgeable I did my best and ended up with this one. To start, it came a few days ago and the packaging was beautiful. It was carefully packaged and had that brand new smell that is just tops. I was surprised how light it was given that it is a 17.3 inch laptop. The keyboard is absolutely stunning! The trackpad and WIndows 8 takes some getting used too but not in a bad way. Just something new. Skryim runs like a dream on it, completely maxed out. The computer didn't get very warm with long usage which was a nice surprise! The cooler booster is a great perk and I enjoy using it, and granted it is loud I just turn up the volume on my game a littler louder. No big. This is the first computer I've had that doesn't have a glossy finish, so the matte looks very different to me and takes some getting used too. It looks slightly oily but you get accustomed to it after awhile. The sound is beautiful! Screen is perfectly bright, not dim at all unless you turn it down. It didn't hook up to my tv very well at first but when it finally did I was like WOAHHH. Just trial and error was all that was wrong. All in all, it was a great purchase! My friends and family are already jealous of it! Should there be any serious faults with this purchase I will update this review, but hopefully all will be well.

Spend the extra bit of cash if you can to upgrade the RAM and stuff an SSD for boot drive into it if you can, far cheaper than paying for the next step up where they do it for you.Under max load, CPU hitting temps of 65c GPU sitting at a cool 55c which really impressed me.Upgrading it was very easy, I love the easy access panel MSI tossed in here for people who would rather just buy their own components for upgrading.  7 screws and you have access to the entire board.And lastly, while I absolutely HATE bloatware... MSI delivers here as well with one minor issue... God please stop putting a firewall on your computers. Soon as norton was removed, boot times were cut in half.And lastly, my one real complaint with this laptop... The screen, it's got great viewing angles, no ghosting, but god that color accuracy is awful.  I work some pretty high end panels normally so looking at one this low quality is really a shame given the rest of the unit.  Not going to knock a star for it since few people will notice it much but if you're used to top end panels...

I wanted to familiarize myself with it before writing a review.  I got a deal from bestbuy for this rig $1210 + tax.  For what I spent I am entirely happy.  Now it is not a desktop so some games wont play ultra'd out.  Like EQ2 which has all resolutions maxed but some particles and other ambients are lowered which gets me 14-25fps.  However eq2 was made for a 10ghz processor and cant utilize all four cores.Dirt 3, Orcs Must die 2 all run on ultra, albeit some screen tearing on dirt 3.  But I think this is a normal problem if you dont want to use Vsync which I dont.  Now when i reboot this thing has a mind of its own as it while take forever configuring files, which I dont have a clue in which why it does when I havent updated ANYTHING.  The other problem is the hard drive cripples this laptop.  I plan on buying a 500gb samsung evo 840 to fix that.So, 3 problems total; Not a SUPER gaming laptop, clueless Windows Configuring, and slow HD.Yet, everything else makes me thrilled to own it.  Killer wifi card, customizable back lit keyboard (with minor flex, but im not OCD so its not even a con for me,) 1080 Screen ( I like the Matte just because family like lights on everywhere,)  Notification lights, the power button is white while GTX is off and glows orange when on.  The battery usage is doable but I don't use this on my lap, its pretty big and a little bulky, but I knew this wasnt an ultrabook or expecting it to be.Dont forget if you want to play a game in windowed mode go to nvidia control and turn the power option to maximum performance or the laptop will throttle the card down.  This took some time to find and was pi$$ing me off tbh.If you want to game between 1200-1500 dollar price range buy this!  Anything above this gives marginal performance like the 780 GTX gives about 10fps more.  I plan on paying about 310 for an SSD and under 200 for ballistix 16gb 1866mhz ram.  And dont forget this lappy has 2 storage bays so you can throw all your music/movies on that, or if you torrent run it on the 1tb drive to save your SSD. Yes heavy torrenting = Dead drive within 1-2yrs.As this laptop goes thru the test of time I will edit it.  For now it feels like I received a cherry picked one, I absolutely love it even if it doesnt max out EVERY game, it gets close enough!!!", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very happy \ufffd", "Author": "Dee 7", "ReviewID": "R2VWXNFX3OCQAA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very happy with it!

Bought defective.", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "RMBMQ7AYO7LF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this beginning of last month. It felt amazing to open the box and see it packaged in multiple boxes, box art was nice and attractive, by the time i removed the laptop from the packaging I was anxious to powerr up the laptop. When i hooked up the cables to power computer, it would not turn on. I figured it was probably my fault for not letting it charge for an hour or so. So I left it charging, it still wouldnt turn on, 15 minutes later it turned on, but it kept shutting down. At this point I figured that maybe the battery needed to charge more, left it alone for 30 minutes and it finally turned on.I frequently had problems wwith the computer attempting to turn on and in the end after contacting customer service through MSI they gave me instructions on how to pinpoint the problem. It ended up being a defective power button, it was broken or wrongfully manufactured.The seller of this laptop tends to respond slowly to most of my questions. If anything they responded to me only after I filed an A to Z claim through Amazon. I'm just so disappointed at this point. I started off by sending calm letters and they drove me to the point of disappointingly writing a bad review on here. I say you are better off buying from a retailer so you wont deal with the stuff I had to deal with.

They are more recognized for their video-cards and motherboards.Pros:-Great hardware for the money-Keyboard types nicely. Very crisp input. As fun as typing on a mechanical. (but there is an issue I'll mention in the cons section)-2 year warranty (but warranty is a con too)-Functions well overallCons:-Sound. Nothing compared to Alienware. People praise this thing for the sound, but it isn't nearly as great as people make it seem.-Keyboard. Backspace on keyboard is squeaking loudly and hard to press. Extremely annoying. I'm tempted to return it.-Build quality is horrendous. Cheap plastic all around. Parts of the laptop don't fit flush where it's supposed to. For example there is a gap in the right side of the lip of my screen. Everywhere is plastic, plastic, and more cheap plastic. Lifting up the notebook makes you feel like you're going to snap the laptop  on the bottom. Keyboard area flexes, pamlrest area flexes, scren lid flexes, bottom panel flexes. Everywhere!- Heat. The single fan design while utilizing a heatsink bridge to connect the CPU and GPU is a horrendous idea. It doesn't cool efficiently. Temps during gaming will reach 86 Celsius easily in a cool ambient temperature room - think winter time.- Warranty. Although the two year warranty is nice, the shipping back to MSi at your expense ($35 one way insured) and then them keeping it for over a week is a huge con.-Screen. Horrible TN panel that you find in a typical gaming laptop. People knock on glossy finish all the time but I would rather have that then a washed out TN matte panel. Where are the IPS displays MSi? This is 2014, we don't need nor want cheap crappy TN panels on our expensive gaming laptops anymore! $1400 is still expensive. You can build a beastly gaming PC with a high quality 27\" 2560x1440 IPS display for that price! Don't jew the customers! We're not stupid.Wireless. Updated bios and drivers but I still get intermittent disconnecting multiple times an hour that lasts around a minute. Really annoying. It seems like it's a very common issue.Overall it's a nice enough laptop, but you will be constantly reminded of why the price is cheaper than an Alienware. The sound quality/build quality on my Alienware 17 blows this thing into the far reaches of the universe. I understand that it comes at a $500 price premium so my rating is reflective of that.
