I bought this few months earlier before Christmas because I had enough money, I didn't want to wait for Christmas because I might not have the money anymore.My brother only used it for 5 days just for regular surfing, then one day he turned it on, it would turn on but there was an error. The error was: cnx00000034  Insert the recovery media cd (which did not come with any installer or cd) or contact your manufacturer.I contacted Gateway,it was easy to contact their customer support through chat, I was told there might be wrong with the BIOS or hardware. We tried to troubleshoot the BIOS. It didn't work it went back to the screen with the same error. So he then told me it was the hardware. It cost me $120 to ship the laptop to another country. He wanted me to send the laptop back to them, which I can't do because it's not worth it sending the laptop back and forth. I told them I will just buy the hardware from them, then he told me that I need to send them the broken part before I can buy the hard drive. Why do I need to send the broken part when I'm not doing this as a part of warranty? He told me that's the only way for me to buy the hard drive from them, if I send them the broken part and it's not a guarantee that it will work. He said this issue is quite common. I am buying the part and paying for it not a warranty replacement!! The agent was nice and helpful except the quality of this product is very poor and also their policy on replacing parts is really horrible.I have always recommended Gateway to my friends and family. I will never recommend Gateway products again!I spent $500.00 on a laptop that was only used for 5 days!", "Date": "March 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "This is as good as it gets for a budget laptop!!!", "Author": "YsLadyMN", "ReviewID": "R358T5L4LBZ1PF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a really nice laptop.  Not super portable, but I really wanted to higher screen resolution and size...  that said. IT'S AWESOME. I want a portable desktop replacement, not something I can slip into a sleeve and haul all over.  This is it.I had a Gateway prior to this one and although it only lasted about 2.5 years... it was smaller. Ultimately that had a fan issue and it was prohibitive to replace even though the part was low cost...  I HATE, HATE, HATE trying to repair laptops and it proved me right once again...  but that did not stop me from buying another.i will say that many years back I was a top end ThinkPad loyalist... until Lenovo took over.  I would prefer a $3000 laptop, but let's face it - no matter what you buy you are looking at a 3-4 year realistic life on a laptop if you actually travel with it.  That and they take much more punishment due to the heat and lack of cooling ability in the small space.That said, this one has fabulous graphics for the business or casual user.  A serious gamer would not be thrilled, but I am.  I sell and support accounting software, and want to watch a Netflix streamed in a hotel room a few times a year.  I also require quite a lot of storage room for client files and databases (I run SQL developer, multiple instances) on here.  It's perfect.They all seem to be going to the flat keys these days, which is an adjustment - especially since I hook all three of my computers up to a KVM and am used to a more ergo keyboard.  however the spacing and 10 key on this are great for on the road...  it's just an adjustment from a standard type keyboard layout of course.UPDATE 4/8/2014 - I have used this laptop for almost 6 months now, not as a full time machine but several times a week.  I searched the model number to see how much a spare power cord is since I will be traveling more soon and always like the secure feeling of having extra power cords, etc. permanently in my brief case...  so I don't get on a plane without it... and I happened across my review!!  I just want to say that I am as happy now, and maybe more as I have adjusted to the keyboard, as I was when I posted the review.  Apparently there have been a few lemons, so if you get one, MAKE SURE YOU CREATE YOUR RESTORE MEDIA.  It will prompt you to do so eventually, but it looks as though couple of folks would have been less upset had they created their restore DVDs.I still highly recommend this laptop. It is large and very tight to fit in my old laptop cases but it can be done with nothing plugged in on the sides and I am very happy to have the larger screen size vs the 15\" range screens.", "Date": "October 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Highly recommended, with a proviso", "Author": "Tom", "ReviewID": "ROGEOC7BIVC1F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If this is the type of computer you are looking for, I strongly recommend you consider this one. You can read about its negatives--and it has a few--elsewhere, but I was looking for a notebook with a large screen and keyboard so I could write in my great room or, weather permitting, out on my deck, not just my home office, and this computer meets my needs and the low price was a big consideration for me.", "Date": "April 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "awesome laptop", "Author": "Janna Ernst", "ReviewID": "R36Y0GNOKIV7JG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "very very satisfied with this laptop,this everything and more i was hoping and paying for :) well spent money thank you", "Date": "April 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "Saif Al-Dakheel", "ReviewID": "R2WL6J6J7X7GUD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So elegant,  wide, slim.

As another reviewer stated, Gateway is now Acer. This is not the same quality laptop. If you open too many websites you get a screen that has wavy lines and computer crashes. I've also had issues twice in 3 montbs where it won't boot up at all and i've had to call tech support. One more time and i am sending it in to Gateway repair for a new one. Not happy with this laptop and would return it if i could. maybe i got a lemon? My next laptop will NOT be Gateway.

Renninger \"Daniel\"", "ReviewID": "R2SVD63KNY7FVP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Someone told me that they purchased a 17 inch laptop for $300.00. I was very surprised that this was possible. So I looked for the least expensive one I could obtain and the Gateway NE72206U has the lowest price I could find. So I ordered one from Amazon since I had a good experience with a Gateway LT2815U netbook which has an unusually robust Intel Atom CPU. Out of the box it looks very nice. But after starting it the installed Norton Internet Security program took over and turned itself into something that behaved like a virus that would not let me do anything else. So I erased the hard drive to the maximum extent I could and installed a new copy of Windows 8 Pro I ordered from Microsoft in January 2013 (during their sale). That is why it would not connect to the internet. So I had to order a restoration disk from Gateway.com for $19.95 plus tax.Evidently, it requires drivers that are not available from their web site to connect to the web. So I had I to install a Wireless-N USB adapter to connect to the internet. I managed to get it connect to the internet but only the internet browsers would work. So I went the to [...] site and downloaded eight drivers, four applications, one BIOS update, and a pdf copy of the Gateway N72206U User Manual which is not included with this computer. I installed the drivers one by one (some are multiplicates depending on who made the specific hardware component), the applications, and the BIOS update, and little by little it began to work as it should so that I could remove the Wireless-N USB adapter. So one definitely needs to be an IT professional to get the Gateway NE72206U to work as it should. I have installed Windows 8 on netbooks that were designed only for Windows 7 starter and they work much better with Windows 8 than they did with Windows 7 starter. That shows you that less costly netbooks are better designed than this Gateway NE72206U Notebook.After using it a little more I have found that the keyboard is very erratic and the cursor tends to jump all over the page as you type which is typical of poorly designed computers. So you only can get what little you pay for here. Thus, the Gateway NE72206U is not a good value.", "Date": "September 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Review my laptop", "Author": "Sonia Jones", "ReviewID": "R1ZMAZWOPRWN2I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm not sure why I have to review this weekly it seems it's a good laptop.
