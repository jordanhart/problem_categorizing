It's simple, sleek, and pretty powerful. I recommend this laptop to anyone who is looking for a laptop that can do the basics and some light gaming. Only downside is the keyboard isn't lit, other than that it's a great laptop. It came fast as well, I ordered on a Wed. morning, and came Friday afternoon.", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "So far....", "Author": "Nicole", "ReviewID": "R2GB0B75JK3I87", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop under the impression that it was a brand new, never been opened computer, since no where on the listing does it say used. However, I did indeed receive a used laptop that I can't even use because the previous owner has a password on his user profile. I am rating this a three until I hear back from Amazon to get this issue resolved. Overall, the laptop seems nice from the looks of it and the profile screen...all I can judge from at the moment.", "Date": "June 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "awesome!", "Author": "Joe C.", "ReviewID": "REEN3ZDHUZJC7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fast, fast, fast!
