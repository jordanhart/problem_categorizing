{"Reviews": [{"Title": "beware!!! it was build poorly!!", "Author": "P. Ng", "ReviewID": "R2RJCMPHLCQW7J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've had my hp tx2000z for over three years now, i loved it early on, then the problems started. it wouldn't start up, so i sent it to hp and i think they swapped the mb, all covered under the 1 yr warranty. after that, i spent the extra 250+ for the three year (total care) warranty, it's full service for a total of three years from original purchase. since i've bought it, i've had to send my laptop in about 5 times, yes that's a lot. also, everything i've bought with their brand has broken, except a hp usb hub -_-  . The docking station that i bought that connects to the expansion port (which was awesome) broke, the included cd rom drive broke, the tiny remote to control media that comes with this thing broke, the tv tuner i added to cart to fill the purchase price broke, the powersupply it came with broke, the power supply i bought that could do auto and air broke, and even the hard drive it comes with started \"clicking\".So, my advice to future HP buyers, beware, HP isn't a good brand! I was \"lucky\" i shilled out another 300 for the extended warranty, but many people didn't and lost. My friend's 1 yr + few months HP laptop failed, prob mobo issues, so BEWARE!back to the laptop itself.The Bad: it overheats, frequently will do cursor jumping (cursor jumps to lower part of screen, prob due to touch screen capabilities and poor construction), will fail, WILL FAIL, only does s-video out and vga out, and oh yeah the paint on top of the touchpad and left click are fading, (it's black plastic under.)BTW, the video card isn't able to play any good games, its much more of a basic video card, don't buy this for gaming!And, if you're like me and enticed by the price and design, then...The good: touch screen, digitizer pen (use the pen like a mouse), decent to good sound, IR receivers on lower left screen and infront of touch pad (very cool when using remote), expansion port (very good accessory), two audio out jacks, and... screen is approx size of letter sized paper?btw, incase you're still wondering why not to buy it, i'll list the stuff of the laptop that has failed,mother board, card reader, cd rom drive, hard drive, wifi card, included remote control, and maybe other stuff, but i lost track.mine is three years old, now, to keep it from failing sooner, i'm keeping my laptop extra cooled. It's on a cooling pad and an extra fan + i plan on adding another fan. based on other people's reviews, heat is the biggest problem.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "AMD Turion 64 X2 Mobile TL-62 (2.1GHz/1MB),4.0GB DDR2 SDRAM\n250 GB 5400 RPM SATA,12.1\" WXGA BrightView with TOUCHSCREEN\nSuper Multi 8X DVD+/-R/RW w/Double Layer Support,\nNVIDIA GeForce Go 6150 w/webcam, Fingerprint Reader, 5-in-1 media card reader,802.11b/g WLAN w/BLUETOOTH\n64-bit Windows Vista Home Premium", "Name": "HP Pavilion TX2000Z 12.1 NOTEBOOK LAPTOP PC (AMD Turion 64 X2 Duo Core TL-62 2.1GHz, 4GB RAM, 250GB HDD/DVD+/-R/RW DL/WIRELESS/BLUETOOTH/ NVIDIA GeForce Go 6150 w/webcam/ Fingerprint Reader/64-bit Windows Vista Home Premium)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41F-8DwuHIL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000WGUG24"}}
