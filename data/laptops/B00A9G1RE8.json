{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Problems w/ Lenovo or Microsoft?", "Author": "Allen Richard", "ReviewID": "R2URPCO8FPP2H8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We ordered this system as a replacement for our CEO's T410 and I needed to set it up quickly.  I went through my normal process of PC prep; remove the crapware, add it to the domain, add the domain user as local admin, then as domain user install apps and updates.  Microsoft updates repeatedly failed.  The only variable was I had disabled the update to IE10.  After much frustration, I \"blue buttoned\" it as we call it; that is use the Lenovo system image to restore it to out of the box status.  Same result.  Microsoft Mr Fix It app could not fix it.  Went back and added Lenovo update to make sure all of its drivers were in place; updated BIOS and some other hardware drivers.  Seems to be working now.  I don't know if it was the Lenovo updater software itself or the BIOS update.  We shall see.  I'm already a day behind having it ready.Concerning the Lenovo T430 hardware, this is a slight improvement over the T420.  Good feel to the keyboard with a backlight option.  They've rearranged the ports again, but what you need is there including a VGA out and RJ45.Note:  This the 2nd T430 we have brought in and at least the 50th ThinkPad.  We generally take the same approach of removing the crapware, including the ThinkPad utilities that offer no benefit (most of them).  I'm thinking it was the BIOS update, though I still plan to punch Bill Gates in the mouth if I ever see him.", "Date": "July 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Niccccceeeee!", "Author": "CTDave", "ReviewID": "RCYACKWKRPNMA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this for my son as a gift.
