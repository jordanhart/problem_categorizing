I was using Linux Mint for a while, and everything worked out great. The trackpad took a little tinkering, but that's because Linux doesn't have the best support for buttonless trackpads yet. After a couple months of use, I decided to install Mac OS X on it. This is not a process that should be attempted by users with little computer knowledge. Much time was spent in a command line environment, and it took me a whole weekend to configure properly. The result is a Hackbook Pro with almost everything working. I get around 5 hours of battery out of it, and everything functions correctly except the wireless card. I'll replace the wireless card with a compatible model later, so there should be no issues. Since this laptop has an SSD, I've installed the operating system on it and used the HDD for data storage. With this configuration, the laptop feels blazingly fast and it goes from cold boot to having Safari open in less than 10 seconds. The keyboard is a little lackluster, but I paid less than $400 for mine, so I'm not going to complain at all. The screen doesn't get as bright as I'd like it to, and the color reproduction isn't accurate, especially at wide viewing angles. I would have preferred to see a higher resolution display, but since I use it hooked up to and HDMI monitor, it doesn't bother me too much.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "cheap and awesome", "Author": "marie", "ReviewID": "R334FJZ5ZSFY81", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price it was right.

Unfortunately the reviews are true. The WiFi is awful. Almost useless. It was basically dead in the water when more than 15ft away from the base. I took this laptop to school and used it where I had used my 7 year old HP laptop with no reception issues and the Lenovo U310 had no service. Even when the laptop showed reception bars there was no service. Its truly a shame. Its a beautiful laptop. The keyboard is awesome. The trackpad was great for a trackpad.Lenovo has a big problem here. There are countless forums of people dealing with this issue and no real solutions.

I was really happy with my purchase for...oh, the first 2 months or so. But things rapidly went downhill from there. First, the wifi refused to connect. Constantly. And when it did connect, it went out. This problem worsened to the point where i could barely use the wifi. Then, it started crashing randomly. This was rare at first but eventually grew to happen about every 10 minutes. The final nail in the coffin was when it stopped accepting a charge. I finally brought it back, used my warranty and picked up a different laptop. It lasted me for three months. What a useless product.", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not without its problems", "Author": "goblin boots", "ReviewID": "R2R4XGBI063T5S", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "As many others have said, this thing has wifi issues. For me, wifi is only wonky when I'm running on battery, and then only occasionally. The trackpad is a bit finicky. The os is installed on the (slow) hard drive, and NOT on the SSD. No matter, I instantly wiped both drives and installed xubuntu 12.10 when I got this.If you're going to run linux on this machine:- You must disable IRST (Intel Rapid Storage Technology).- Disable EFI booting.- Seems like there is an SDL bug with recent Ubuntu and Mint versions that cause the trackpad to be completely unusable when running fullscreen SDL apps. There's a workaround, but it's a pain in the butt.I would recommend against KDE at the moment, as the Intel HD 4000 graphics do not seem to play well with KWin from my experience. Lots of strange artifacts and screen tearing.I also tested Linux Mint 14 Cinnamon, which seemed to work fine.Booting up, with linux installed on the SSD, is ridiculously fast, as is waking from suspend. The machine does stay cool and quiet most of the time.Oddly, booting from the USB 3.0 ports seems to work only if you're using a USB 2.0 device. I'm guessing this is probably because I've disabled EFI booting, but who knows.I paid a premium to buy this machine over the newer revisions with i5 or even i7 CPUs to ensure I got a Windows 7 machine. Who knows what kind of crazy hoops I'd have to jump through to disable the SecureBoot nonsense if I'd gone for the newer Windows 8 models.This is my first non-ThinkPad Lenovo machine. I'm not exactly disappointed with this laptop, but I'd almost certainly spring for an actual ThinkPad next time.", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "awesome machine", "Author": "Alfredo Coppola", "ReviewID": "R3ECCFXY2HHARW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Boots very quickly, even after three months of use.
