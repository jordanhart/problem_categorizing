But - be sure to change dpi scaling in windows settings, it defaults to 125% and text appears blurred unless you change it to 100%.The speakers are really good, but the headphone jack seems a bit underpowered. I might invest in a small usb soundcard dongle.Great keyboard, very firm and responsive with the most impressive backlighting I've seen in a while. But, the right shift key is very undersized and I've accidentally hit another key instead many times. I'm a fast typist at roughly 100wpm and I have to pause to make sure I'm hitting the right key.The touchpad is more or less fine. This was the thing I was worried about the most, but I've had no issues. It's just like a mac one.ConsThere is a lot of bloatware. And it was a pain to remove. For instance, McAfee sticks around even after you uninstall it - you have to use mcafee cleaner. Same with the cyberlink stuff - use the cleaners available on their site. I'm technically inclined as most gamers are, so it shouldn't be a real problem, and it does make this laptop cheaper - but be aware.I also had a weird instance after initial boot where my screen went completely blank - not black - the shade of purple windows 8 uses, but with no tiles or anything. I did a system restore and everything was fine, but it was an annoying software glitch.When I'm typing on my desk, the edges where I rest my forearms are sharp, and it's a pain. Really, it's actually painful.The webcam isn't worth anything in below broad daylight. It's a mess of noise and darkness, unfortunately.Overall, great laptop, solid purchase, but a few flaws.", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best bang for your buck", "Author": "prisM", "ReviewID": "R2ZDYMEP1M1CYU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At time of purchase this Lenovo is by far the best deal around in terms of laptops for gaming on. I encourage you to shop around all the other popular brands--no one beats 6/8GB RAM, dual GT750m/755m, and i5/i7 processor. Amazon changes this build around quite frequently so double check all parts in it before you buy (dual cards vs single card, RAM/processor type, etc).My build has an i5, 6GB RAM, and dual GT750m cards. Purchased on sale for ~$850 in Jan 2014.It plays Counter strike GO at max settings with 80-130fps. WoW on ultra at 45-55fps, high at 70-80fps. DOTA2 settings maxed at solid 60fps in teamfights with vsync. All of these at 1920x1080 resolution. They got all the SLI graphics driver issues all figured out with win8, so there is no concern there like you might see in other reviews.The point is this thing is a beast for the money, you wont be disappointed.Cons:1)  It gets hot and needs to be gamed on a flat surface to ventilate properly. This shouldn't come as a surprise, all \"gaming\" machines these days heat up pretty good without a cooling pad. it has a massive grated panel on the underside to help with airflow, and the card vents on either side get the job done well.2)  The track pad is quite possibly one of the worst designs and worst user experiences in the history of modern laptop computing. I honestly don't know what Lenovo was thinking with this one but it is god awful. luckily you will probably be using a mouse 99% of the time anyway.happy gaming", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "This thing is a beast, Get it!", "Author": "FatedCb \"Every one of us has a purpose here.\"", "ReviewID": "RJKG5099N99MS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This thing is a beast!

I'm going to just keep posting this everywhere I can find.Lenovo; For Those Who Don't:January 23rd I received the IdeaPad Y510p from Lenovo, and it ran like a dream for 13 days, then I go to take my dog outside and put my laptop in sleep mode and come back in and it won't turn back on. I called in and had the option to return/refund it or repair it. I went with repair in hopes of being able to keep my data and awaited the box that tech support said I would be receiving in 3-5 days...It's the motherboard that needs replaced; power light turns on but the fans, hard drive, keyboard lights, screen, and even USB power are unresponsive. A $1,649 paperweight.20 days later I call back, having been busy with two jobs in Advertising, furious. I found out that it was never sent out and that it was just kind of forgot about. So you kindly \"escalated\" the repair to an on-site request after you said it would take almost twenty days for a repair and I would still have to wait, that you thought I was sending it in a second time for a second repair, and that you said I couldn't refund it until I told you I talked to a Sales Manager and they said I could and you looked into my history and found I actually did talk to someone and I could due to the situation.Well that on-site guy THAT YOU SENT OUT came today and broke the laptop even more. He lost one screw when taking it apart, forgot to put two screws back in, broke the bottom latch/lock for the laptop, part of the frame (a little plastic clip on the inside but it looks warped now) and was banging the laptop, jabbing it with his plastic tool, and kept saying \"I sure hope I don't broke it, don't wanna do that!\" I took pictures and cringed the whole time. I about had a stroke watching this guy \"try and not break\" my laptop. AND IT'S STILL NOT FIXED. It's just been sitting on my desk since I got it.This is a work laptop.I not only make money on this laptop, I spend money on it monthly for my software.I make $18 an hour at the job I got this for, and it has cut back my time there drastically. I can't work there I can only work from home. I was averaging about 3-5 hours a day until the laptop broke. Now I get less because my home computer isn't meant for this work.The software is $20 a month that I can't use.My freelance pays $30-$60 an hour just for design fees.I've lost more money because of this laptop possibly than for what it's even worth.You better get back to me soon.You have my case number.You have my name, phone number, and email.If Lenovo is for \"Those Who Do\" then what you need to DO is start making up for what you DON'T DO.So do something right for once and call me.This laptop has not only cost me time and money, but now it's cost me my patience.", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,009.99", "Features": "Intel Core i5-4200M 2.5 GHz Processor\n6 GB DDR3 RAM\n1 TB 5400 rpm Hard Drive; 8 GB Solid-State Drive\n15.6-Inch Screen\nWindows 8.1; 3-Hour Battery Life", "Name": "Lenovo IdeaPad Y510p 15.6-Inch Laptop (59406634) Dusk Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51rIP7wjs8L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00HIY96WO"}}
