TV, camera and Vaio notebooks.I purchased Sony's Vaio Notebook July last year. The notebook not reliable since the first day I received it. It turns off itself once a while. Finally in June this year, one month before warranty expire, I sent the computer back for service for broken optical drive and power shutdown problem. Sony service fixed optical drive and didn't tell me they didn't fix the power shut down problem. 3+ month after I use this computer, I found the power problem coming back and call Sony service. They admitted power problem was not fixed during warranty period when the computer was there. Now it passed warranty, Sony will have to charge me $630 to fix it. I said I want to talk to their supervisor, they didn't let me do it.Sony's customer service is so bad. They don't care about customer at all. I will not recommend anyone to buy Sony products based on:1. Product reliability.2. Very poor customer service.3. Company's culture just don't care about customers once the product is sold. Trying to milk more money from customers from fixing their own design/ manufacturing problem.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very satisfied with this product!!", "Author": "Adrienne Baum", "ReviewID": "R3J977MW3K9XXX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love the backlit keyboard!!

The keyboard lights up which is my strongest selling point because I was looking for laptop use mostly at night. The keys are smooth and the touch pad is as well. The battery life is alright but I believe it can do better, maybe last around 5 hours.", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$899.99", "Features": null, "Name": "Sony Vaio  SVE15113FXS 16-Inch Laptop PC (2.50GHz Intel Core i5-2450M Processor 6GB RAM 750GB HDD, Windows 7 Home Premium 64-Bit)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/310xQZxjuvL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009YNEGTA"}}
