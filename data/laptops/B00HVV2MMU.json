Cone \"book collector\"", "ReviewID": "RDSSSYBL2BPMX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As one of the many making the transition from Windows XP to Windows 7 and a new computer, I did my research carefully, and this sounded like a special bargain, It has a solid State hard drive, and comes with Win 7 and 8.1/ It has a nice sleek case, and various bells and whistles like an optical (CD) drive in the notebook, fingerprint ID, and more.  the only drawback so far is that it comes with zero  help in getting started and installing the various programs. the \"Getting Started\" booklet that came with it only has pictures and identifies what all the slots are for. I had to download a 17-page booklet from Microsoft on how to upgrade from Windows XP to a new computer and Windows 7. There was no boot screen on the new computer.I called HP anad got a technician on \"Live chat\" and he determined that the bios was defective. within 2 days I received a shipping box and prepaid label, sent it back, and in less than a week had the computer back again all repaired and with Windows 7 installed.. I still think it's a bargain, and I'm sure I will love it. Try Google for good instructions on the switch from XP to Win. 7.", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Still waiting!", "Author": "Joseph K Prince", "ReviewID": "R3DAC2KMF92L6R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The laptop HP I purchased failed to serve me as of this day.
