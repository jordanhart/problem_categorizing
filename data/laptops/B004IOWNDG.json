{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Value Priced Laptop", "Author": "Derek Shockley", "ReviewID": "RW3GFCXWPNL1M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was in the market for a new laptop for school that I could pick up for a good price. I ended up narrowing it down to a few models in the $400 - $500 range with a 15.6\" display. I ended up getting the Toshiba Satellite L655-5150 at Best Buy for $450, but seriously considered a few others. The Toshiba had 4GB of RAM, the most offered in this price range. The hard drive was only 320GB, but for me that is plenty. I have 2 TB of external drives I use to store videos and archived files on. If hard drive space is more important to you, you can find models offering 500 GB in this price range (The Gateway NV5105u is one I was considering.). The Intel P6200 processor is good, but not necessarily the best offered in the range (The Dell Inspiron I15R-1197MRB comes with a 2.4GHz I-3.). The inclusion of a number pad on the keyboard was a big selling point for me, and the overall aesthetics of the computer are good. Setup was extremely easy and the computer came with very little bloatware installed on the system. I am happy with the Toshiba, but there are several contenders in the \"value-priced\" laptop category. I think my second choice would have been HP's G62-457DX for $400.", "Date": "February 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Toshiba hit the mark!  Easy Set-Up - Fun to Use", "Author": "Darice Davis \"la33deedah33\"", "ReviewID": "R2X70QGZH2XZWX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had the opportunity to set up the Best Buy (Torrance, CA) version and the experience was easy -- for a PC -- which is saying a lot from this Apple fiend.  These are the steps this set-up required:  1)  This rig was added to an existing PC only network behind a Lynksys router running a desktop and a Toshiba Satellite L505; 2) I registered w/ Toshiba; 3) Microsoft driven updates totaled 40 which took 3 turns of installing & restarting, but with this speedy machine it was a breeze; and 4) I downloaded and installed individually a menu of free/open source security software including AVG AV, Clam AV, Clam Win, Zone Alarm Firewall, and Panda Cloud AV -- (so much because one of the users is Skype/social networks fiend, and so far no problems, and I like to keep it so).The actual hardware is fabulous -- very responsive keys on the keyboard which look like chiclet design to me.  The boot and re-boot and turn off times are incredible for this price range.  It feels like a well made and well thought out laptop.  The only problem I had was the balance on my Podium Cool Pad laptop stand ( [...] ) -- the laptop is top heavy perhaps due to the 6-cell battery -- and unless balanced precisely it will fall over screen first which is not good for rugged, gaming, dorm room/student use.The owner set up the webcam, Skype and facial recognition features, and they must be very easy and smooth because I have received no Help! requests, and I hear much laughter from their area.", "Date": "March 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worst laptop i've ever owned", "Author": "Heather2010", "ReviewID": "R2F7VKY05T7CH3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you want a laptop that won't charge (not due to the charger) but because the charger port is faulty, then this laptop is for you!", "Date": "January 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "ClassyA", "ReviewID": "R1ZW2R5W8NN34E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the toshiba satellite L655-S5150 last February when my old computer broke. I was in a pinch and had to buy a computer that day. I ended up getting this one on sale in the $400 to $500 price range (I can't remember the exact price). I love this laptop. It is by far my favorite computer that I have owned and I have had no problems with it. I like that a numeric pad is also on the key board. My husband ended up getting the same series but a different model than mine and the only difference I notice in his is that his keyboard is backlit. Nice feature, but I wouldn't have paid for it. All in all you can't go wrong with this laptop. I am a full time student and I can keep everything I need on here.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004IOWNDG"}}
