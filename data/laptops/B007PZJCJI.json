No problems. Fast shipping, in just 1 day arrival. Came in original box with all software disk included. Harddrive was wiped and fresh windows 7 installed, without all the annoying extra software you get from a original Dell. One improvement, wound to include instructions on how to install all thefactory software and how to register the warrant. But since my previous laptop was a dell I already knew how to do this. For example, the laptop did not come with the web cam software installed. I had to go to the Dell driver/software page to install. Like I said no big deal, but someone unfamiliar may have a problem. Recommend this seller to other buyers. Would buy from them again.", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "not new", "Author": "magda liska", "ReviewID": "RDGV3QUE07EL4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "ordered as new, loads of confusion on amazon's part prior to christmas, received laptop on christmas eve, problems after 3rd day, when contacting dell, told that warranty was expired because  laptop was registered the year before to someone in California, I am in VA.  very disappointed.
