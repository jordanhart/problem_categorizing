I have always love IBM Thinkpad and Lenovo does not seem to have not diminished the quality. Keep in mind that this laptop is a few years old, but within a few days I found I had a hard drive problem, I could hear the hard drive head clicking which if you know anything about computers it meant that my hard drive would eventually die. I did an Image backup of the T400, in fact I made 4 different Image backup. I am a bit cautious when it come to ability to restore my system in case of a crash. After doing the backup I replaced the hard drive and started the backup which did not go well. The image I made on my DVDs did not auto run on start up. After a day or two of banging my head and thinking I would have to purchase another copy of Windows I did an internet search and found I need an installation disk to get the image recovery started. I had a Windows 7 upgrade disk from another computer and use it to access the Recovery console at start up. From there I was able to install my saved image back onto the T400. Now I have the same Windows that came with my system but on a larger hard drive. As I said, this system is older and no seller can guarantee the life of a hard drive so this was an inconvenience and I did have install a new hard drive but the T400 is perfect machine. Only because of the hard drive problem am I giving three out of five stars. I dont think", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great laptop", "Author": "Gary K.
