Shami", "ReviewID": "RDBLEZZ4OGXV8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this laptop since Sept. 2011, (its a 2009) it has not giving me any problems at all I have read all the reviews and I would have to agree with the some of the negative things people stated but they are not things that I would consider to warrant a bad review. Yes the touch pad can be sensitive at times, but nothing that has bothered me to the point of bashing this product after some property adjustments it worked fine, and yes the lid does need two hands to open it... SO WHAT... stop being lazy put down the donut and grab it with both hands and open the thing, and as for the cover not having full range of tilt ALL once again... SO WHAT... it is enough for any normal person to accommodate their viewing needs! As for performance mine never crashed and boots up with in 1 minute, I maintain it with installed utilities, (such as Anti-virus malware defrag and disk check) that are automatically run on a monthly basis.  For the price this machine is well worth it! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MACHINE!P.s. I am sure that some people receive a few bad machines out of 1000's that happens with every product especially electronics these days, but bashing the product over feeble things such as cover tilt range, and weight of the cover, or because of the sensitivity of the touch pad, or even the tech support is pretty weak argument to make... tech support was great for me and even if it wasn't ... the reviews left here are for the MACHINE should not related to TECH SUPPORT.  IF... tech support was bad but the machine deserved 5 or 4 stars then rate the Machine on its performance and plainly state that \"TECH SUPPORT sucked\"!  That only seems fair to me, but maybe thats just me! That's like saying the performance of a car sucked because the dealership that sold it was mean to me, when the car drove great!

At that time, Lenovo was bundling the laptop with Windows 7 OS. When I upgraded with the Windows 7 OS copy that Lenovo sent to me, my battery stopped working.I contacted Lenovo several times to resolve the issue. Their technicians at first denied the existence of the problem (even though many people have encountered this issue), then later upon subsequent calls stated they did not know what the problem is. They ran me through circles of updating firmware, power drivers, etc. but nothing worked. All this time I could only use my laptop while it was plugged into an outlet, no real mobility could be achieved with it. Whats the point of a laptop then?Luckily for the miserly geniuses that work at [communist] Chinese owned and operated Lenovo,  my warranty expired shortly thereafter. I call again later hoping the evil geniuses have 'figured out' the problem and they now want to charge me approximately $60 to diagnose as I am out of warranty.Please take a moment to read their forums before you purchase.My laptop has buttons that have popped off, a hinge that is broken, and trim work that is broken. Its truly a piece of crap laptop and I'm an IT expert that has used: Toshibas, Dells, HPs, Macs, etc. and have NEVER, EVER seen such a poorly built laptop. Even the keys feel cheap. I should have not purchased this without testing it out at the store first, I got performance/price greedy and liked the hardware specs.NOT WORTH IT.

In general this computer has never been stable enough for me to trust it for any other use but web browsing and the ilk.I still like the thinkpads (this ideapad sucks all around though), but this is my last lenovo for no other reason then they sell crippled hardware - not cool, I paid for the cpu let me use it.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Horrible and a big waste of money", "Author": "A.

I still prefer to use my 5 year old HP Laptop over this one.- The touchpad is sooooo frustrating. It sometimes gets too sensitive and sometime would not respond. I have tried different settings but to no avail.- What can I say about the boot time. I power it up and can go around for few minutes and it wouldn't boot up completely when I return.- The keyboard layout is weird. You would find keys that you would hardly use easier to reach.

Han", "ReviewID": "R5YP4QTRNIHJP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Before I launch into my vindictive diatribe, I would like to say that perhaps I am in error. Perhaps I did not take better care of my computer (although I doubt it, since my previous laptop from Acer lasted me a good 4.5 years, all through my undergraduate career, and had been subject to much more battering than this laptop), or that I should have been more sensitive to this computer's needs, but at this point, I am very convinced that I will never buy a laptop from Lenovo again. This is my first review, possibly my only review ever, but my experience with Lenovo has been so bad that I think you deserve a warning.Service Issues:1) Lenovo messed up my online order. I'm not even sure how this is possible. First, they said my CC did not get authorized. I called my bank. They said they authorized it. Lenovo denied it again. Lenovo told my bank to call them so they can work things out. Convoluted things happen. They do so, and I receive my laptop. Unfortunately, I'm charged twice for the same laptop, and Lenovo sends me a two copies of the same laptop. I try sending the first one back, but they do not give me a warning when the person will come to pick it up. Because of the nature of my job, I cannot simply just wait around all day waiting for the mailman. I hold unto the laptop. (my mistake)2) I finally call Lenovo again to send in the extra laptop. They give me a code. I put it on the box, go to the UPS store and ship it in. A few weeks later, I get a notice saying that the shipment never arrived. I call, they look into it; apparently, they received a box without anything in it. At this point, exasperation ensues. How is that even possible? They file a missing box/shipment. The issue is, to my knowledge, still unresolved.Now, onto the laptop itself.1) Webcam breaks within 3 weeks. It picks up light, but monochromatically. Not worth using. (It was good when it worked though)2) Battery breaks down within 5 months. Laptop recognizes that battery is plugged in, but does not use it. I've been told that because the battery isn't part of the warranty, I have to pay for it myself. Fine. I'll do it once I finish my project and don't need a laptop. (FYI, you need to send in this computer back to Lenovo so they can fix it. You will be laptopless for a while, not sure how long since I cannot send it in until after one of my projects is completed. But, still a major major inconvenience.)3) Sound quality is terrible. The laptop sound system crackles often, and although it is loud, the incessant sound fuzz is just enough to just have me plug in my iPod instead directly into the laptop itself. I am not an audiophile, so people with more refined auditory systems might be really repulsed by the sound.3) As a minor pro, in contrast to the major cons, it IS a fairly light laptop. However, there is a great sense of fragility to this laptop, and does not feel at all sturdy. After my webcam and battery breaking, I'm just afraid that this machine is going to break down completely. I've stopped carrying it around as much, and have relegated it as a desktop-laptop, which of course, completely gets rid of the very idea of having a portable laptop in the first place.Conclusion:I wish my experience with Lenovo had been more positive, that they could get the order right in the first place, and that this laptop was not so fragile. Overall, there seems to be better options available, so I recommend you look elsewhere first. I wasn't suckered into buying this laptop; I thought it would be genuinely good. I do like that they put in Windows 7, that the processor is fast, the RAM quick, the keyboard \"clicky\". But, my personal experience with Lenovo has been so bad that I just cannot in good conscience recommend this laptop.", "Date": "April 15, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features":
