First person I talked to. Perhaps I was just lucky, but that's the best service I have received from a computer customer support line.I haven't had any Wifi trouble since then. It appears that when I uninstalled McAfee Antivirus (to replace it with AVG), I did not correctly uninstall it. Uninstalling it from the Control Panel is not enough, you have to run a special McAfee removal program.This laptop is not perfect, but it's as close as I could expect for the price.I wish the screen were better, and the trackpad is a bit touchy, but for the price I couldn't ask for more.ORIGINAL REVIEW (3/5):For the price, it's a pretty good system.I would give 4 or 5 stars, except that the Wifi has never worked correctly. I know it's a common problem, and some have had success fixing it. No luck for me though: the connection still drops every so often.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "cheap and great laptop", "Author": "Moe", "ReviewID": "R308R0OWMFM0Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the lenovo Y410P from the manufacturer for a really good price, the only problem i have is that it takes a while to load when you start it up. works great on all the games i play on. 4.9/5 stars.", "Date": "April 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent!", "Author": "Chien Cheng Chu", "ReviewID": "RG6OXNV435HKX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very good laptop what I've ever experienced.

Kelley", "ReviewID": "R1B01ZT1GRZODD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had my laptop shipped through a remailing company overseas and was very disappointed to receive a laptop that had issues. Yes, it was refurbished, but that means it should be restored to factory standard status. The Y410P I received had a boot-up issue that caused my computer to take up to 15 minutes to reach the login screen. After communicating with the seller, nothing was resolved and they wouldn't allow me to ship it directly back through them, it had to go back to the remailing service first. This was too much of a hastle for me, so they offered the phone number of Lenovo in my country to have them look at it.This whole issue was quite frustrating and after spending countless hours of my own time trying to fix it, I found an alternative \"solution.\" The computer still takes 4 minutes or so to boot, which is much longer than advertised.Nothing else is wrong with the computer but this ordeal has made me very dissapointed in the product. If you wish to buy it, I would recommend a new laptop over a refurbished one.", "Date": "March 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "simeon Zeyse", "ReviewID": "R1M5IWMZ9M37RU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like this Laptop so much everything is great except that if the GPU is running the Laptop gets hot an the Ventilation gets loud.

It is a very snappy, very portable computer with decent weight. It looks great too! The optical drive is easy to remove - and you can buy a caddy online shaped exactly like the optical drive that came with the laptop to have 2 hdd on this machine.Unfortunately,  I had to return it back to lenovo due to trackpad issues. Mine came with a defective trackpad. Lenovo did not cause any problem with issuing refund.  I dont understand why lenovo keeps using such a cheap trackpad on this machine. Even the newer series Y40, Y50 uses the same cheap trackpad  :(  Also screen brightness was not great, but I could live with that ... defective trackpad was a big problem though.

Lenovo purchased the entire IBM Laptop division a few years ago.The Y series and a few others are supposed to be \"new\" models. Yes and NO. Yes there new to Lenovo's line up, but do not stack up to the rest of the major brands and tend to cost the same or more. My black covered key pad tops are already wearing off after only two months of use. I have the Intell I 7 chip and Nivida G Force graphics card, but the machine preforms poor to average. The edges around the machine are squared off and hurt my hands when I type our just rest them there. There are far more modern and sleeker machines out there for less with the same equipment.

First a .dll file was corrupted and anything you clicked would shutdown/close windows, fixed that, next thing the system says it finds an error and will repair it, then crashes the entire system. You call Lenovo support, get people who transfer you, barely speaks enough English that it requires 4 tries to spell my first name (which is incredibly short). The software support team for Lenovo is a complete joke, and wanted me to pay $89 bucks to buy the recovery disk, I had to tell her 30 time transfer me to a manager because I couldn't understand or hear her.  All I could hear is the co-workers chit chatting and laughing in the background.  She couldn't walk me through support so I ask for a manager and told him the problem.  He said he would transfer me back to warranty (where I started) and promised to explain what was going on to the person in warranty, of course he didn't explain anything and dumped my call on someone else.  At least this final person spoke English and actually walked me to get to the system restore, I'll have to see if it corrupts itself a 3rd time.  The phone call lasted almost 2 hrs because they have incompetent people doing support.I highly doubt that installing iTunes, Google Chrome, Amazon Music Play, ChromeCast and Logitech mouse software would corrupt the computer.  I had the above software and tons more installed on my last computer.My first support call was on 1/26/14.  Today I made my 2nd call 2/12/14.  For a computer that is 3 weeks old with barely anything installed, it's starting to get annoying when messages saying we've found a problem, we need to reboot and my computer went into a never ending boot cycle.  What really annoyed me is that Lenovo tech support couldn't answer my questions and they he tried to BS me with his answer.  When I pointed out that these thing don't happen due to a Microsoft update (last time the computer didn't even get updated) he started stuttering and being more vague about his answers.  I am told to call their Post Sales support to see if they will replace the unit.  I was told they only replace units that 21 and less days old.They would get negative stars for their tech support.This computer is so slow to boot considering the tech told me this is one of their high end models and shouldn't have these kinds of problems.  He's blaming everything on Windows 8.  Will update review after Post Sales Support call.So I tried calling again on 2/13, couldn't get through their endless press this number and that number system to actually get a hold of a live person.  I called back on 2/15 was transferred over to another department, the call never went through, I was just hung up on.  Called back, transferred again, was on hold for over 20 minutes, disconnected again.  Funny part about the waiting queue is that I was told I was number 5 with a 20 minute wait, then number 3 with a 20 minute wait, then number 4 in the queue with a 20 minute wait.  So call back number 3, got someone who was trying to be helpful, but then the call got disconnect again.  She actually called me back, but within a few minutes another disconnect.  She didn't bother to call me back a second time.  So I called back, she wasn't even done processing my request to have the entire unit replaced.Honestly I don't believe this is a Windows 8 problems when I am getting error message about power problems and the system needing to be rebooted.  Sad part is a lot of people in technical support fields are not technical savvy and really don't know what they are talking about or doing.  I feel like the first 5 people on the technical support side just made up a lot of what they were telling me.  If feel bad for anyone who deals with Lenovo technical support.  I had to call Sony once on my VAIO and the problem was fixed.  All the years of owning computers with only one prior need with my Sony laptop, this was just a horrible experience.At the end of the Feb, I finally got a replacement machine.  I didn't run into any more power problems, but there was other software issues that took a while for me to find and uninstall.  There's too much bundle software.I honestly like this laptop, but the hassle, extremely poor technical support by Lenovo, you really need some technical background to deal with them.  I really felt like they wasted my time and wouldn't listen to me and actually resulted in arguments with them.  Then for them to pass me around technical support because I have a technical background and they figured they couldn't BS or lie about everything being Windows 8 problems.", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EUTLFG0"}}
