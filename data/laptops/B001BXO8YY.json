I'm very pleased with it, I do a lot of music on this one, I want to add more memory if possible. This computer can handle many operations at one time,the duel core processor is awesome and if you had a tera byte of storage you wouldn't  have to upgrade for a long time. I recommend this computer for students and home production as well.  ( MARVIN C.

I don't need memory (this does have 160gb though, enough for anything I would do, just not good if you're looking into gaming) so bad since I back everything up instead of storing it on my computer, but the 4gb is great for getting stuff done at a good pace. i got mine from pacific macs and they have been so awesome at sending forgotten and replacement parts (apple chargers suck! buy a backup!) totally recommend buying from them say april sent you, lol.", "Date": "March 13, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001BXO8YY"}}
