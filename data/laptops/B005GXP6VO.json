I left it in a hibernate status once for a couple of days and then when I tried to restart it, it wouldn't start. It just died, talked to HP, they looked at it and they said it was a system failure and they could not replace it. I am very glad it happened within the first year and it was under warranty.HP staff was kind enough to replace it with another new laptop(different model). I think this issue has been happening with a large number of DV6 laptops so I would think twice before buying it. Also make sure you have extended warranty on this laptop.", "Date": "July 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "great computer!", "Author": "tomer", "ReviewID": "RP2DXYL1NOTZA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop as a main computer.

It has its quirks... It works well enough, I am having issues with the network adapter but not that bad.  For $400 off I can't complain too much.  Screen is beautiful.  BluRay looks great!

Chatterjee \"Jay\"", "ReviewID": "R358G79PRAAIFD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this HP Pavilion dv6t, special edition about an year ago. It seems that this HP product is good in built quality. I am traditionally a fan of Dell and  used/using at least four Dell laptops (for personal use only). I had a great expectation from this HP notebook, my first HP product in any category. But I am highly disappointed. I tend to believe that the issues I face is not very specific case for my particular unit but general problem with HP laptops.My first set back when I discovered that this HP product does not offer different color management, specifically Adobe RGB. I have all my photography equipment set at Adobe RGB, all my Dell notebooks offer many color management schemes, including Adobe RGB. So I can use this Pavilion dv6t for my photo need but with severe limitations. HP technical help could not offer any help.The main trouble started around 8 months after I purchased it. The computer became too slow and started hanging over frequently, leaving me frustrated. I lost many valuable data and research work due to that rampant and random hang ups. HP technical team diagnosed that it has bad hard drive. HP refused to replace the defective unit but repaired it. That took about a week.But the problem came back within a couple of months of repair. Again I am having the problem. A new problem also arose- the sound quality started deteriorating. Even at the highest volume, it is not much audible.Probably this is my last HP hardware.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Intel Core i5 Processor 2.4GHz\n6GB DDR3 RAM\n640GB Hard Drive\n15.6-Inch Screen\nWindows 7 Home Premium (64-bit)", "Name": "HP Pavilion dv6t Select Edition 15.6\" Laptop - Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit, 2nd Generation Intel Core i5-2410m, 6GB DDR3 Ram, 640GB 7200RPM Hard Drive, Blu-ray Player & Supermulti DVD Burner, Webcam, Fingerprint Reader (Dark Umber)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZObzy5dmL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005GXP6VO"}}
