Not too much crapware installed.  Nice option during setup to set partition sizes.Out of the box Windows Experience Index: 5.9.Processor: 7.5RAM: 7.6Graphics: 6.1Gaming Graphics: 6.1Hard disk: 5.9I wish the arrow keys were a bit larger - maybe 3/4 size (if not full size) instead of the 1/2 size that they are (on the other hand, I need to remember that the numeric keypad does double duty with full size navigation keys).  I would have preferred to have power connection in the rear rather than the side.Update Dec 13: The wifi antenna is giving me noticeably worse performance than my previous laptop.  Working from the same chair, my 5 year old Dell D620 was getting link speeds of 36-48Mbps.  This laptop is getting 5-18Mbps.  Loss of 1 star.Update Dec 14: There's no BREAK key on the keyboard!  This forces you to use the mouse to enter/leave full screen remote desktop (instead of ctrl+alt+break).  No ctrl+break either. The touchpad is taking some getting used to.  It produces an audible click, but the force required to produce the audible is less than the force required for a mouse click to actually register with the OS - need to see if that can be adjusted.  The display has an ambient light sensor near the delete/home/end/page-up/page-down keys.  Using those keys causes the display to dim.  Disable the sensor via the easy settings apps.Figured out the problem with the touchpad. It has a deadzone that is about 3/4\" inch long by 1/2\" tall.  The deadzone is located on the left half of the bottom edge.  The right-half works fine for right-click.  Left-click is a bad experience. No clicks are ever registered in that zone even though the pad does make an audible click.The external power supply isn't too large.  But it makes a heck of a lot of noise even though it is on the floor underneath a table.  I thought I was hearing clicking of disk drive head movement.  Nope, the power supply makes a staticy-clicking sound whenever I alt+tab between windows.  That sound is also made when using arrows keys to move up and down lists or when using the mouse to reposition scrollbars.The bottom of the laptop is very smooth/slick.  Keeps sliding around on my legs and requires that I apply downward force with my palms.  I'll need to put some textured tape on the bottom.Starting to regret this purchase...Update Dec 15:  The deadzone on the touchpad is getting smaller.  But the lower right corner of the touchpad feels like it has gotten a flat tire.  It is now noticeably lower than the rest of the touchpad and right-clicks are more difficult there as there is almost no travel left for clicks.I now understand what the other reviewer wrote about jumpy cursor.  The problem is due to the deadzone.  When I do full left-right sweeps on the touchpad, it is very responsive except over the deadzone.  Then the cursor hiccups - it doesn't jump, it just stops moving, then starts moving again when my finger makes it to the other side of the deadzone.I really want to like this machine (all the features are there and the form-factor is fantastic - 1600x900 in a small 15 inches), but the wifi performance and touchpad durability/performance are killing it for me.  Maybe this will also turn into a review of Samsung repair service.Got AutoHotKey to map CapsLock to Break.  Search for the \"How to add a Pause/Break key to a keyboard that doesn't have one?\" question at superuser com.At every new user session, there are like 4 or 5 samsung apps (battery, easy settings, harddisk, ...) that require UAC elevation when you login if using a standard Windows account.  Administrative accounts are only prompted 2 or 3 times.  All of these apps are scheduled tasks that are triggered by login.And the wifi performance still stinks.Update Dec 17:  I like the display and hardware (other than the wifi and the busted touchpad).  I'll buy a new router to see if wifi performance improves.  The touchpad will need repair, but I don't want to part with it quite yet.  The dmhkcore.exe app that provides oem fn key functionality does not work properly with standard user accounts.  It needs to be terminated and then restarted with admin privileges in order for fn+(f1, f2, f3 or f12) to work correctly (the other fn key combinations do work without admin privileges).Update Dec 20:  I got a new Netgear WNDR4000 dual-band N router (the old Linksys router did G).  Wifi link speed improved but is still on average lower than my old laptop from my working position (read that as: the N performance of my new laptop is slightly lower than the G performance of my old laptop).  If I move about 12 feet closer to the router, then I start to see what N is really about.Update Dec 21: I checked out the B model that was on display at Best Buy.  The touchpad is the same but that one did not have the deadzone that mine has.  It does have a similar flat-tire right-click area.Update Jan 6: check out the samsung forum over at notebookreview dot com.Update Jan 18: This laptop does not support OpenGL running on the AMD graphics card.  See the forum over at notebookreview. /samsung/630666-series-7-chronos-all-:models-push-samsung-implement-fixed-mode-bios-23.html#post8247924 and /samsung/630666-series-7-chronos-all-models-push-samsung-implement-fixed-mode-bios-23.html#post8248124Update Feb 17: OpenGL issue is resolved with just released drivers.  I removed the 4GB stick and replaced with 8GB - now I have a total of 12GB.

I have now had a chance to use it for the last 6 weeks.Fortunately Wi-Fi turned out to be OK (details below).This laptop is fast, quiet and runs cool. The matte anti-glare display is very pleasing and bright.It is a pleasure to use, the backlit keyboard is a must, no more fumbling in the dark.It's also great that it is equipped with a full size HDMI port for connecting to a TV etc. By the way, it switches automatically to the dedicated AMD Radeon HD 6750M graphics board when plugging into the HDMI.Two of the three USB ports are USB 3.0 (great for fast data transfer to external drives)It has a very large TrackPad which obeys somewhat similar hand-gestures you may have become used to from smart phone displays. I am a mouse fan and turn the pad off because my thumbs rest on it when I type making the cursor jump all over.This Series 7 SO3US model comes with Win 7 Pro and a factory recovery disk that allows you to do a clean install (nice touch and almost unheard of these days).The -SO3US model may be the best value as compared to the other models -S0AUS, -S0BUS, -S04US, -S09US etc. because the S03 comes with the maximum 8GB RAM, 1GB of dedicated graphics memory and Win 7 Professional already installed (although one of the other models has 1TB HDD).It has 8 GB of RAM and a 750 GB 7200 RPM HDD.This Series 7 is faster than a typical PC equipped with HDD (Hard Disk Drive) because Samsung equipped the motherboard with an 8GB SSD (Solid State Drive) used for faster execution of programs and boot-up (as compared to a PC with HDD only).The optical drive loads the DVD automatically when partly inserted into the slot (similar to a Mac). Push Fn and Delete simultaneously to eject (not mentioned in the Quick Start instructions).I personally prefer the old fashioned mechanical tray-loader with a push button for opening.  The disadvantage of the slot loader type is that it may not accept the small diameter CDs often containing drivers for accessories (I did not dare try).But I guess it is a matter of preference because you may prefer to download drivers from the manufacturer(s) website which will ensure that you always get the latest/updated version.WI-FI PERFORMANCEAs mentioned our biggest concern before buying was the horror stories relating to poor Wi-Fi performance of Samsung Series 7 laptops equipped with the Broadcom Wi-Fi card.The first thing I did after opening the box was to test the Wi-Fi signal strength using inSSDer 2.1 (free software). A great tool, it will show you all the routers in your area including signal strength (and much more).My hart almost stopped when comparing the 15\" Series 7 with my own 17\" Samsung RF711 S03US.I could only see 3 routers on the 15\" Series 7 whereas I could see at least 16 routers on the 17\".  Also the signal intensity measured in dB (decibel) was significantly stronger on the 17\" (a smaller negative number indicates higher signal strength = closer to zero).Any difference is significant as 3 dB increase represent a DOUBLING in strength.I was ready to pack it up and send it back but decided to put it to the test using \"LAN Speed Test\" a highly effective program to map and troubleshoot transfer speeds in your network.To my surprise the 15\" with the Broadcom Wi-Fi board did better over \"long\" distances compared to the 17\" with the Intel Wi-Fi board. As you will notice the 17\" did better at short distances where the speed was 1.5 to 2 times higher but \"relatively poorly\" at longer distances.In my opinion the 15\" Samsung Series 7 with the Broadcom Wi-Fi card came out as the winner in these tests.YOU CAN CLICK ON COMMENTS BELOW THIS REVIEW TO SEE THE ACTUAL TEST RESULTS.SSD UPGRADEThe computer was fast in the factory configuration however if you desire EXTREME SPEED or longer battery life you can replace the original HDD with a SSD.This is exactly what we did to this laptop and boy it's fast!To find out how it's done click on this link .... Samsung 830 - Series MZ-7PC512N/AM 512 GB 2.5 Inch SATA III MLC Internal SSD Laptop Kit with Norton Ghost 15 and search in the reviews for the heading: \"NEED FOR SPEED! You got it... and without losing the factory F4 recovery option. HERE IS HOW!\"WOULD I RECOMMEND THIS LAPTOP TO A FRIEND?Absolutely, the factory configuration and performance is excellent. It is very thin, light and  perfect for travel.Only users that need to manipulate large graphics/video files or perhaps have been \"spoiled\" by SSD systems may want to consider a SSD upgrade. (This category will also want their computers connected via a wired network).Some early versions of the Series 7 laptops that hit the market may have Wi-Fi issues (as reported in some early reviews and complaints all over the internet) however if you have problems, the first thing to do would be to verify that you have the latest drivers (I have added the Driver details and HOW TO DO THE TEST as a comment below this review).Before this purchase, we compared a lot of different laptops and eventually ended up with this one over the Sony Series S VAIO laptop. The Sonys (in the store) were running so hot that the back was unpleasant to the touch.A couple of important pointsThis 7 Series is up and running in TWO SECONDS from sleep mode and a reboot takes 22 seconds.You only reboot once a week when you use the Fast Start feature (it will ask you once a week).Also the backlit keyboard is fast and pleasant.I hope this review can bring some facts to the table regarding the ongoing Intel/Broadcom Wi-Fi discussion and also help you find the right laptop.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing laptop but has its flaws", "Author": "hbaig1206", "ReviewID": "R17FOK6U43WIPP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've used Desktop PCs for as long as I could remember and this is the first laptop I've ever purchased. However I did tons of research before I purchased this machine. So as a new laptop user, I just want to say I'm pleased I made the change to mobile computing.The laptop has a lot pros, but it also has some cons that really stand out. The hardware itself is solid. Aluminum build with a clean brushed look on top. The keyboard is very easy to type on, but the edge of the laptop is sharp and it digs into your wrist while your typing. It's more than a minor annoyance. You'll find yourself lifting your wrist off (mainly your right wrist) to see the marks the edge leaves behind. I'm not going to lie, the edge is sharp enough to put in some pain. I suggest wearing a wrist band while typing.Another issue that bugged me a little bit was the video graphics. If you don't optimize the graphics to play videos off the web, such as Facebook videos, the video itself will get scrambled. It will continue to play, as you'll still hear the audio, but the video will be glitched. And it just won't happen once. It will continue to happen until you go into the Catalyst Control Center and deal with the issue.Seeing that I'm coming from a desktop PC, I really don't have much to compare the battery life to. But from using the computer for over 6 hours continuously, with WiFi on, I can say that it's sufficient enough to get you through a full day's worth of work.The backlit keyboard is beautiful, and the display is straight up gorgeous. The \"max screen\" technology they added to the display really helps it stand out among other laptops. The viewing angles, however could have been a little better.For the price of the laptop, I wish a BluRay player added instead of a DVD writer. But in the end, you'll be trading the BluRay for the newest i7 quad core processor, and a top the line graphics card. So in my opinion it evens out. Besides, who uses physical discs for anything anymore? :PI haven't played any games on this yet so I really can't say much about the graphics itself.ProsBacklit keyboardFast start up from cold start or sleepSleek lookNumPadSlot load Disc Drive instead of Tray LoadLong Battery LifeConsEdge of laptop digs into wrist, leaving marksGraphics aren't set up out of the boxNo BluRay DriveJumpy mouseI would Recommend this item to others.", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Overall fantastic with some reservations", "Author": "Christopher Bennett", "ReviewID": "REKIWO0DMMXMA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There is a common issue with the space key on this laptop in that pressing it on the edge will often not register even if you press really hard. This is incredibly irritating for a touch typist, but today I solved the problem on my laptop! So if you have the same issue see my video on the quick fix over at [...]. Basically you just need to stick a square of paper between the space bar and its pressure sensor.Also note that this S03US version is functionally exactly the same as the S01US version, with the only difference being that the first 4GB of RAM is permanently attached to the motherboard on the S03US.  The S02US and S04US are likewise functionally identical. The Best Buy version (I don't know the product code) is completely different though. I have no idea why anyone would buy that one.Among the positives for this laptop are its speedy CPU and GPU, readable resolution on the bright non-reflective 15\" display, light weight, stylish form factor, really superb battery life, a great backlit keyboard (once the space key problem is resolved), and a good amount of RAM and hard drive storage.Because the positives are so great I am giving this laptop 5 stars even though it has several negatives.First, the space key issue.  This is a quality control issue that should have never occurred, and I hope Samsung will send new space bar keys to all the people who bought this laptop. But until then, you can try the quick fix I referenced above.The choice of DVD instead of blu-ray is odd and perplexing. However, I so rarely use even the DVD and to be honest I would probably never use blu-ray if it were included, so as strange as it is that the feature is missing, I don't mind.I am not pleased with the choice of the broadcom wifi, which does not support 5ghz wifi.  I have opened up this laptop, which is very easy (close the LCD, flip it over, remove the ten screws on bottom, then flip it back over, open the LCD and gently pry the case shell loose along the edges and then close the LCD and flip it over again and gently pull the bottom off), and replacing the broadcom wifi adapter with the Intel 6230 part should be very easy [SEE EDIT BELOW]. There are only 2 antenna wires, so getting the 3 antenna version would be pointless. Also, be sure to get the one with bluetooth if you try this, otherwise you will lose bluetooth since it is provided by the broadcom wifi adapter.The webcam camera does not work well in low light.  Meh.  Turn on a light, I guess.I use the touch pad as little as possible and prefer to use a mouse. It seems to work alright for me when I need it, but I sometimes disable it while typing so I can rest my palms while typing.Overall the negatives are not a big deal for me.Edit Dec-2012: It is indeed very easy to replace the broadcom wifi/bluetooth adapter with the Intel 6230 part. Do NOT get the newer Intel 6235 part as it WILL NOT WORK, as I discovered. Some people have also reported issues with getting the 6230 to work, but the trick is to uninstall all Broadcom software related to the wifi/bluetooth BEFORE installing the 6230. This very importantly includes the WIDCOMM Bluetooth SOftware software. You should also download the Intel drivers for the 6230, and install them after you have removed the Broadcom software. Then open up the laptop and swap the parts and reboot.

Not sure and have never been given a clear answer.I have called them several times in regards to an Intel error message that keeps popping up. They still have not given me a clear answer as to why it is happening.The most frustrating, the usb 3.0 ports do not work properly. I have tested other computers, and the issue is on Samsungs end. I called the support line and they said they would repair the problem since it's still under warranty.  It was a major hassle speaking with Samsung. Several times they were trying to tell me the problem was the cable or something else. When they finally agreed to repair it I felt like I had won some moral victory.  But they got me in the end.  I just received my laptop back, and no repairs were made since the laptop still has the same usb 3.0 issues, and the kicker, they removed personal folders, Adobe X, and Office professional from my laptop.
