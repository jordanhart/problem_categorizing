I got a Apple ibook G4.  I got if for myself, but ended up giving it to my 6 year old savant.  He loves it and will NOT let anyone touch it, that includes me.  I will be getting another one for my youngest.  I guess it depends on the parenting you have with your children to get them a product like this.  I love it and would tell others to shop with them.

I wish I had paid attention to some of the other reviews off of amazon so I would have been fully aware of the limitations..... This was supposed to lighten the load on my laptop and instead any games or YouTube do not work... But he's able to use it for school which is what is Important... He just wanted to be able playing his games and videos on it as well...but it was quick shipping and the photos in the listing appear to be the actual one that was shipped to me. A pleasant transaction :)", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001OVIF8S"}}
