{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great gaming laptop that's cheaper than most", "Author": "Dakota Moore", "ReviewID": "R22J4FZD2E4LJW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this laptop for a little over 2 weeks now and know most of the goods and bads.The good:I can run any game i want at decent settings. I have played through BioShock Infinite on Very High settings maintaining a solid 50-60FPS. There's a lot of complaints about overheating on the web but i have yet to experience any problems. On my third hour of use i was at ~60 degrees Celsius, which isn't that bad, (It spiked at 60, but stayed at 40-50). It runs perfect and very fast. I was able to download 3 different programs, while running steam, origin, 4 tabs on chrome, including a YouTubevideo playing at 1080p, while playing Infinite on Very High Settings without any hesitation. This thing is a BEAST. I am able to run AutoDesk Inventor (3D modeling software) without any lag and am able to render models exceedingly fast. Another plus is the weight. I was expecting it to be VERY heavy, but honestly, it's not that bad. I can carry it around in one hand no problem for a few minutes. The design on the laptop is also VERY beautiful with the red chrome and the red backlight keyboard.The bad:The track pad is terrible. Clicking the track pad has a 50-50 chance of a left click or a right click. But i fixed that with just buying a wireless mouse. Next is the fan. While this laptop doesn't overheat, it does run hot, and the vent is on the right side of the laptop, right where i usually put my mouse so my hand heats up a lot. The boot-up time is not terrible, but i plan on putting a solid state in to help that. The battery is also pretty terrible, with only an average of 1 hour when putting stress on the laptop (playing a game or using 3D modeling software) but that's expected with so much power.All in all, i am very happy with this laptop. It's a beast when it comes to running things, as long as you're next to an outlet.", "Date": "April 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "So far so good", "Author": "Eric Cartman", "ReviewID": "R33BR9SEHKHK58", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "PRO:play most games in ultra setting over 60fpsLooks goodCON:Needs a cooling pad (like most gaming laptops)Windows 8", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent device - powerful, great display and graphics, nice looking too!", "Author": "S. Brenner", "ReviewID": "R3LYHFGLVZ584X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What a nice laptop!  The first thing one must do (with all new computers) is load the laatest drivers and software patches.  Toshiba makes loading drivers a breeze, there's a \"service station\" app that keeps things updated and the device also sends device driver notifications. I didn't activate the built in Symantec anti-virus as I (and most people) use the free anti-virus software available from my Internet Service Provider.  I also downloaded Open Office for free instead of paying for Microsoft office, which has a trial version already installed.  OK, the keyboard is backlighted in red, user switchable for active or not.  The keyboard is full size, keystrokes positive and very nice. There is a neat 'Qosmio\" backllighted emblem that is visible to anyone who is looking at you from across the table.  This machine has best quality graphics at this price point and a lot of power under the hood with 12 Gb RAM, an i7 core and GTX-770M GPU.  DVD player is fast!  There are USB v3 ports on both sides and an HDMI port as well.  I use a laptop cooler (pay $20 and get one for peace of mind!) so when I am using graphics intensive programs things stay cool.  I bought a \"Cooler Master NotePal X-Slim\" (R9-NBC-XSLI-GP) for my machine; it is quiet and fits very nicely.  This laptop is brought to you by a name-brand manufacturer, and Toshiba laptops are considered to be \"Cadillacs\" in the laptop arena.  My laptop certainly upholds those credentials.  You won't be disappointed!!", "Date": "May 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Toshiba Qosmio X75-A7170 17.3-Inch Laptop", "Author": "Walker", "ReviewID": "RLZ152GGAJYL8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Outstanding laptop.
