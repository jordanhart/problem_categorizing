I got this one at Best Buy for about $[...]. For the price I found it to be a good buy. It came with the 64 bit version of Windows 7 and had two gigabytes of memory, a single core AMD 64 bit processor and a two hundred and fifty gigabyte hard drive. Uses shared memory for graphics.After using it for about a week I became frustrated with the length of time it took to boot up and another while for your program to load. Once your program was loaded, it would run ok but I did not run more than three programs at once. It also seemed relatively easy to stress the processor. The system monitor would indicate processor usage was at near one hundred percent by merely installing a program. The battery life was respectable and the built in wireless worked very well. I found the keyboard and touch pad to be a bit odd but I quickly got used to how they worked.One peeve I had was that the initial memory came in two one gigabyte modules. It would have made more sense and been cheaper in shipping the laptop with a two gigabyte module. I however do not pretend to understand the business decisions of these computer manufacturers.Bottom line.Good value for the price but recommend increasing the memory to at least three gigabytes to work well. Good for light use around the home or at the office. I have not tried but I don't recommend games on this unit. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could but I cannot seem to give half star increments so three stars it is.", "Date": "December 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Versatile Mobile Machine", "Author": "Matthew Rajotte", "ReviewID": "RP46TSZB0RGXE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My initial needs which lead me to purchase a laptop were mobility, media storage and playback  (HD and non HD), and 3D modeling using Google SketchUp. I was looking to spend around $450-$500. After some research,this model kept making the comparison and with the price, it started looking like a winner. I made my purchase and I have never been happier. The screen is the right size for mobility, without sacrificing it's viewing capacity. Having a discrete graphics card, while not the most recent of architecture, coupled with (shared) 256mb from the DDR3 memory it performs quite well. I have to say it this laptop runs SketchUp almost as good as my desktop rig Core 2 Duo 3.0ghz 8gb of RAM and Geforce 9800GT video card. In all fairness, Sketchup is 32bit and can only address 2gb of ram, and is only a single threaded so alot of what you think are advantages to my rig, they are infact not. I guess the point of this review is..... this laptop does a couple of things at a time really well. If you push it, it will perform like a cheap laptop. If you want to surf, watch Hulu, and model a spaceship in Sketchup, she will perform like a much more expensive laptop.I should also mention it plays Age of Empires III, Starfleet Command 3, and Command & Conquer First Decade quite nicely.ProsSolid hingesBattery life is excellentLightweightRuns cool and almost completely silentexcellent performanceUsable gaming capacityConsNo HDMIno webcamOverall I am completely impressed.", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Cq56-115dx  Joke is on Hp and Nvidia", "Author": "Jesus S. Mijares \"MECH\"", "ReviewID": "R1YBMGP8JZCG6M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Well let me start by saying that this laptop i got from the Nvidia settlement. It was to replace my dv9000 specific model 9428nr. my old computer had a 2.2 GHz AMD Turion (tm) 64 X2 Dual-Core Mobile Technology TL-64, 2Gb of ram max, and a 17 screen display, and that problematic nvidia chip, dual hard drive bay. use to do a lot of work on it for engineering classes it went well and it did everything i had to, but then it started having the classical problems of losing the wireless and over heating. by then my warranty had expired from best buy. So i was stuck with a half working laptop and it was not too old is was about 2.5 years old. so then i got a letter in  mail that there was a legal class action and that my laptop qualify for an exchange for an equal laptop in value. So i said why not and i ended up sending it to the Nvidia settlement. So when i got my cq56-115dx i was for some big disappointment.cq56-115dx came with a 15 inch screen, a single core amd V140, able to upgrade to a max 8 GB of drr3 ram, ATI 4250 graphics (not bad).NO second bay for a secondary hard-drive. NO express card, No 5-in-1 integrated Digital Media Reader for Secure Digital cards, No  Expansion Port 3. and NO Number keypad on the right. Maybe i could have life without some of things, but what really got me mad was the single processor of the cq56-115dx. REALLY???? what a way to make it to customers who were having problems with the faulty nvidia and who paid $1200-$2000 for these laptops.Performance of cq56-115dx as is no sugar coatingfirst of all you must upgrade the ram of the computer to a max of 8GB if want to be able to do some multitasking. with the 2GB of ram that came, multitasking was so painful.After you upgrade the cq56 to a max of 8gb the computer runs a lot better. I was able to run engineering programs and do other things at the same time. but for more demanding programs the computer began to lag a lot. For example if you only run a program at a time then the computer is fine, but if you want to listen to youtube while running a demanding program forget it. solidworks with youtube on the background and some pdfs open equals total lag. Something i was able to do with my older computer.Running videos on youtube at 1080 p is a total lag.Last time i tried to run HD video on gametrailers web page, nothing else open, there was so much lag that i had to switch it make to standard view.People who are going to use this laptop for Microsoft word, power point and internet they should be just fine.bottom line this laptop will run great if you run a greedy program at a time, real multitasking is not existent with the cpu amd v140.So i search to try and see if any possible upgrade here are the possible  cpu upgradesAMD Athlon II Dual Core Mobile Danube- ChamplainP320 2.1 GHz AMP320SGR22GM 25WP340 2.3 GHz AMP340SGR22GM 25WAMD Turion II Dual Core Mobile Danube- ChamplainP520 2.3 Ghz TMP520SGR23GM 25WP540 2.4 GHz TMP540SGR23GM 25WP560 2.6 GHz TMP560SGR23GM 25WN530 2.5 GHz TMN530DCR23GM 25WN550 2.6 GHz TMN550DCR23GM 35WN570 2.7 GHz TMN570DCR23GM 35WAMD Phenom II Dual Core Mobile Danube- ChamplainN620 2.8 GHz HMN620DCR23GM 35WN640 2.9 GHz HMN640DCR23GM 35WN660 3.0 GHz HMN660DCR23GM 35WP650 2.6 GHz HMP960SGR23GM 25WAMD Phenom Triple Core Mobile Danube- ChamplainP820 1.8 GHz HMP820SGR32GM 25WP840 1.9 GHz HMP840SGR32GM 25WP860 2.0 GHz HMP860SGR32GM 25WN830 2.1 GHz HMN830DCR32GM 35WN850 2.2 GHz HMN850DCR32GM 35WN870 2.3 GHz HMN870DCR32GM 35WAMD Phenom Quad Core Mobile Danube- ChamplainP920 1.6 GHz HMP920SGR42GM 25WP940 1.7 GHz HMP940SGR42GM 25WP960 1.8 GHz HMP960SGR42GM 25Wwhere copy and search  on ebay HMP960SGR42GMso at the end i bought a dual core amd phenom IIx2 N640 clock at 2.9 Ghz for $56 plus free shipping. let me tell that you what a big difference it makes. true multitasking, and now i can play hd videos without any lag. not to mention that i now have the ability to play some games.how to replace the cpu amd v140 for a amd phenom IIx2 N640first flip the laptop upside down on a table remove the battery. Now get a standard star screwdriver and begin to remove all the screws that you see on the bottom of the laptop. As you are taking them off remember where you took them off from. the ones with a little brown mark are bigger and thus correspond to the outer perimeter of the chassis. the little screws with blue are attached to the mother board and thus belong to inside. remove all screws even where the battery was before. Next open up and remove all screws of hard drive and remove hard drive itself. Next open up where the ram goes and remove the ram itself. remove the wireless card which has one little screw and is attached with two cables one grey an and one black or cable 1 and cable 2. double make sure you remove all screws, the hard drive, the ram, and wireless.flip the laptop and open the display you will remove the key board. you will need a flat screwdriver if you look top left and right corners between the speaker panel and keyboard. place the flat all the way down and begin to lift the corner slowly then move the flat screwdriver to the other corner so that it becomes detached. Make sure you do not pull to hard on the keyboard as you lift tilt the keyboard and see the ribbon attached to the motherboard, finally carefully remove the ribbon and the keyboard (if you forgot to remove a screw you will have a hard time removing the keyboard and you might break it) . now remove the dvd drive just with your finger get hold of the dvd-drive and pull the dvd drive out, it should come out completely without any problems. next look where you just you took off the keyboard there are about three ribbons you need to disconnect (make sure you do it). after that with fingers of flat screwdriver began to detach the top part of the chassis off the bottom part thus exposing the motherboard (color blue). once you see the motherboard remove and attached cables to the motherboard about 4 or 5 cables remember where they go. DO NOT REMOVE THE SCREW OF THE DISPLAY YOU DO NOT HAVE TO REMOVE THEM. There are two physical screws on the motherboard take them off and lift carefully the motherboard. make sure to bring down the display because it flip on its own weight. So flip the motherboard on the back you will see the fan and the cpu. remove the cable of fan to motherboard. remove the screws of the fan. finally you will see the cpu with a flat screwdriver twist to let go of the cpu lift it up and carefully put the other back in. make sure you apply thermal paste (arctic silver only a little then with you finger spread it, it the cpu is a bit dirty clean ( clean the silver square)it with a little of alcohol and q-tip before placing it and putting thermal paste)and tight back the cpu with the flat screw driver. then began to put everythig back together. If you have open up computers before then this will be very easy.10 mins to take everything off and another 10 mins to put everything back to together. if for some reason you do not place ribbons securely your computer wont boot and will just stay on the black screen with the fan running only and the caps lock key flashing light (happened to me. secure everything). so after you place everything together you should be able to boot into windows normally and start using the computer normally. you should have  a better cq56-115dx.Cpu $56 plus now about $40 8 GB of ddr3 ram, you are looking at $100 to make a good Cq56-115dx.the ram i bought is crucial 8Gb kit 2x4Gb 204-pin SODIMM 512x64 DDR3 PC3--8500 CL7I am happy now with cq56-115dxwindows rating6.1 cpu7.1 ram5.3 graphicsbenchmark of passmark of cpusold laptop--2.2 GHz AMD Turion (tm) 64 X2 Dual-Core Mobile Technology TL-64  1049cq56-115dx--amd v140 single core @ 2.3 Ghz  674cq56-115dx--amd phenom IIx2 N640 @2.9 GHz  1794having said all of this, hp has no quality control and what they did to us in the nvidia settlement is very very unacceptable by all standards.its a slap on the face and on the hard earned money of people. and worst part was that my old computer was a gift from my mom and the money she wasted.  If i did the same poor job i'll would be fired from my job, but hp and nvidia have gotten away with a poor job.

Brown \"Hugh\"", "ReviewID": "RSBH0VE4SDHVP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My previous laptop was running on an Intel Celeron M processor (1.6ghz) and was in the process of dying  (speakers burned out, blue vertical line on the screen and the hard drive was acting up) when I purchased this one.  Since this computer was running on DDR3 memory with a faster processor I expected more in terms of performance. It does run faster with some limitations,shortly after I purchased it I notice that if I played video (not hd) and started up the browser (mozilla) the video would run sluggish for a few seconds and if I opened more browsers or did not put a check on my multitasking it would get worse.Recently, I upgraded the memory to 8gig and the sluggishness during multitasking is less noticeable. I am using this computer to do some video editing, I am converting some VHS tapes to avi format and it is handling the conversion fine- VHS converted to VOB using a standalone dvd recorder then converting the bloated VOB file to avi on the laptop. While the video conversion is taking place I can do other tasks but the computer runs very sluggish so I just let it do that single task alone.  The video editing is the most demanding task that I use it for  while the others involve, besides browsing and watching video,  word processing and using the spreadsheet software. If there is anyone who can tell me/us how we can possibly tweak the win7 64bit system to get maximum usage of the memory please inform us.I am not witnessing any of the slow startup time mentioned here, I have disabled certain programs in startup, particularly some of the proprietary HP programs that are not really needed and have altered some of the frivolous visual effects, I really don't need transluscent menus or rectangles to operate.I also have quite a bit of backup software including a version of win 7 64bit so I do not have to rely on the recovery software located on the partition.I actually have no real problem with the keyboard I have to admit though that from time to time I keep hitting the key for the calculator. As another person commented I too like the matte finish. The screen size is slightly smaller than my previous laptop but I have no real complaints and its brightness is adjustable.  I somewhat miss the sd card slot but my camera has a usb chord and doubles as an adapter. I do not use the touch pad, never did on my previous computer, I have a cord usb mouse that suits me just fine.I would have rated this four stars but I find it difficult to support the notion that those of us who purchase this product, are forced to accept the proprietary software without any option to purchase it without it.", "Date": "May 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Get a better one", "Author": "Sridhar Devulapalli \"Devulas\"", "ReviewID": "R3S1J57ZGS4LLW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this free of cost from nvidia-HP settlement after my dual core dv6113us's display broke down.

That being said, i'm only giving it 3 stars because it worked nicely when we first got it. It slowed down quite a bit if you had more than a couple programs running, but I could compromise. What concerned me is how often the fan would come on, and how hot the machine got without a vent beneath it.These days the fan is constantly running, and CPU is through the roof (frequently at 100%) for no apparent reason, even upon start-up or with just a web browser on. It sounds like a small jet is sitting in my lap. It struggles having only 3 browser tabs open.

It has survived my abuse for more than a year, including being dropped into a koi pond. It was cheap, but it is very well-made and reliable.The point of this digression is that a small price tag doesn't have to imply poor-quality merchandise. Plenty of low-end products offer solid builds; the savings comes from cutting out bells and whistles, but not (necessarily) sacrificing the quality of the materials that make up the product.Sadly this is not the case with the CQ56. I bought mine for about one hundred dollars less than what's listed here. My desktop PC was fried in a storm and I needed a new system in a hurry and on the cheap, and on that level the CQ56 fit the bill. And the thing is, it was just great for six months and more. It has just a single-core processor, so it's no powerhouse, and there was always a little lag opening Firefox. But generally it was just fine. I wrote a bunch of papers, did a ton of grading, and even some simple gaming on it. It always ran very hot, something I'd read about in other reviews online, but I was careful to keep it on flat surfaces, and on the few occasions when I watched movies in bed or what have you, I made sure that it was well-ventilated.I was running Windows 7 Ultimate (64 bit). Everything was great until a week or so ago. The fan kicked on, making a ton of noise; the system heated up again; and from that point on, nothing worked. Safe Mode would run alright, but of course, Safe Mode is not a permanent solution. At one point the PC took more than twenty minutes to boot in normal mode from being powered off. Programs would take insane amounts of time to run; even switching between active windows was slowed nearly to a stop.Thankfully it was still under warranty, and it's currently being repaired by HP. But based on this experience, and the time lost for repairs, and the very real risk that I won't have my PC back before heading abroad for a research trip in a few days, I will never again buy anything from Compaq. And again, before you say \"You should have known better--it's a COMPAQ,\" I repeat my earlier claim: lower price doesn't have to, and shouldn't, mean lower quality. But in this case it does, and that's why you're better off giving another company your money.", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Low Level PC", "Author": "The Dean", "ReviewID": "R3LCPNQOIQOJO6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Like many here, I received this laptop as part of the nVidia settlement.  While I agree it was a very poor replacement for my old laptop (mid-quality 5 years ago, but it least it was a dual core), the reviews should be about this particular PC and not our displeasure with the settlement.With that said, this is a real piece of junk, IMO.  I work on computers all day long, repairing and installing new machines.  I haven't come across a new PC this bad in years.  It is EXTREMELY slow.  I do quite a good job at eliminating unnecessary startup apps and killing most of the unnecessary visual effects that sap performance quality.  Still, this thing just drags and drags.I gave it two stars (instead of one) because of its very low price.  It is probably adequate for those who use a computer for email and a bit of web surfing.  But this machine ships with only 2GB of RAM which is barely enough for a PC with a good processor running Windows 7.  I will probably end up adding a few more GB to the RAM and that will help the performance a bit.  But if I paid for this computer, adding the RAM would make it closer to $400.  For less than $400 you can get a laptop that is FAR better than this.  I think with a bit of smart shopping you can probably score a better laptop for $300 or so.One may think speed isn't important if all one does is email and a bit of web surfing.  True to an extent.  But you still have to update it and install some programs.  You will find these simple tasks take forever to finish.  (I'm not talking about the download time.  I have a very fast cable broadband connection.)I will end up giving this (or selling it very cheaply) to a friend who has no computer.  But I will add RAM before I can even do that as I can't in good conscious give this to anyone the way it is.My advice:  Steer clear of this laptop.", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "It is cheap", "Author": "Scott J.
