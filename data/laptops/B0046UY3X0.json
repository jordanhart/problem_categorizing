{"Reviews": [{"Title": "the best budget laptop", "Author": "N & B Loftsgard", "ReviewID": "R2TE4OOD86QOV6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're looking for a inexpensive laptop of this size then this is a perfect choice.Initial Impressions:-----------------------------I've only had the laptop for a few days, but am quite happy with it.  The number pad is great, island keys look nice and feel good.  The track pad has a ton of settings and options so with a little fiddling you should be able to find the settings that work for you.  The display is definitely widescreen but looks great.  There wasn't too much bloatware installed - mainly just a bunch of HP programs, but they were easily disabled/removed.  Comes with McAffe 60 day trial which I uninstalled.  Also comes with Office 2010 starter which provides Word & Excel limited versions.  I love that this has a 7200 RPM harddrive as most laptops skimp with slower 5400 RPM options.  Webcam works great and has a built-in light/flash.  HP & Windows 7 even have face recognition for logging in, although that doesn't always work.  The top has a matte finish with what I can best describe as a fine wood grain look that's somewhat grey/brown.Update: one of the main reasons I bought this laptop was for the HDMI output so I could connect to my receiver and HD TV then play videos, Hulu, etc. from the laptop to the TV.  After a little tweaking of the audio playback device both audio and video worked great over HDMI!  I should note that the audio signal is not surround, but 'just' digital stereo.Regarding Memory:-----------------------------I ordered another 2GB of RAM and after removing 7 screws I got to the memory location under the keyboard and the additional memory looked to be exactly the same as what I ordered.  You can google to find the instructions for removing the keyboard on HP's website.  However, I don't know that 4GB is absolutely necessary for this laptop.  It depends on how many programs you'll have open at a time and how you plan to use it.  Many people probably don't know that 4GB is the maximum amount that a 32 bit Operating System can reference.Overall:-----------------------------Circuit City (owned by the same company as Tiger Direct) via Amazon had the best price for this laptop (400), even better than Newegg (420).  I was surprised that shipping took only 3 days!", "Date": "January 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Loooveee iiitt!!!", "Author": "M. Nagll \"fitness freak\"", "ReviewID": "R330ZM7JZ69H5L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My reference point is from the use of Thinkpads for 10 years (t-20, t-40, t-60) and the Dell Latitude series for another 3 (both brands are premium business laptops).This is my take on this deal: This is a fantastic buy for $399! And stand-alone, not a bad computer!The outstanding: - Great built in camera (2Mp - most others have 1.3 or just 0.3) - Faster HDD than most other laptops (7200 rpm, most others have 5500) - Fantastic connectivity for this price class; HDMI, eSATA - Durable design using polished metalThe good: - Quite good speakers for this price - Processor is reasonably fast, graphic processing also - Keyboard is water proof, HDD has shock absorber functionThe bad: - The touchpad buttons are part of the touchpad, making them difficult to use as the cursor will typically move when you click. I use an external mouse, so it is not really a problem. - I find myself mistyping more often when using the keyboard than on my Lenovo Thinkpad or Dell Latitude - and my fingers are not particularly fatThe ugly: - Adding more ram was NOT a cakewalk - dissembling the keyboard and top panel was easy - putting it back together again was a nightmare, eventually had me using a kitchen knife to modify the plastic panels (if you do this be very gentle not to bend anything, so you don't have to bend it back like I had to...).Would I buy it again? Definitely! I love this thing!------ Additional observations added on August 1st, 2011 ------ - The wireless antenna is awesome. In locations where my two-year-old Thinkpad achieves just one or two bars from the wireless network (or sometimes none), the HP achieves four. - The web-cam works extremely well in dim light, better than that of my Thinkpad and on par with that of my Latitude 4300. - I've had no issues whatsoever concerning stability after nearly 3 months of usage. No hang-ups, crashes or freezes! I think this is the most stable computer I've ever owned.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "A very fine business machine", "Author": "Edgar S. Young \"Edgar in Virginia\"", "ReviewID": "RLCSRMKXLQBVI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a surprisingly good laptop for the money! Although I purchase nearly everything from Amazon, I caught a 24 hour special on another site that I just couldn't pass up.After returning two other laptops from another company that did not meet my graphics expectations, I was a little concerned about this one - you usually see these kinds of specs in much higher priced machines. Although the Microsoft Windows Experience Index is not a techie's dream, it does give a standard measurement that indicates how well the computer performs using Windows 7 (scale of 1 to 7.9).After the first start-up, I ran the Index with the installed 2GB memory. Then I installed 4gigs and updated the Graphics and bios. Here's how the numbers came out:Processor:  5.2,  5.3Memory (RAM):  5.5,  5.5Graphics:  3.3,  4.1Gaming Graphics: 5.1,  5.2Primary Hard Disk: 5.9,  5.9These are very decent numbers.x32 and x64 OPERATING SYSTEMS: I wanted x64. I called HP Customer Service and ordered the x64 at no cost. Within less than two days I received the disks via FedEx Express (good, responsive, customer service). Not one disk, but three Windows 7 disks arrived (x32, x64, and a recovery disk).GRAPHICS: Although this is a business-field computer, I need good graphics nevertheless. If I lift this laptop up and put it next to my 24\" desktop monitor (with an ATI Sapphire Vapor-X Radeon HD5770 video card that gives me an Index of 7.4), I can hardly tell the difference except the colors appear richer on the HP laptop!KEYBOARD: Excellent. Generous sized keys. Nice border between the main keys and the ten-key area. Keys have a nice touch.TRACK PAD: I find no fault with it.ENCLOSEURE: A stylish black case and keyboard that looks very business professional. The finish shows finger prints easily, but I find that a Meguiar's Supreme Shine microfiber towel remove finger prints without a trace. I also use it on my black keyboard and tower.PROBLEMS: Installing the memory modules was a bit of a chore, but I knew about it before I ever purchased this machine. Be aware that the screw threads are not small - they're tiny.  And the two rubber caps at the back are nothing more than two thin rubber caps with sticky on the backs. An Exacto blade makes them easy to remove.I'm delighted with this laptop.", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic, quality constructed value.", "Author": "ladyrose8303", "ReviewID": "R1HCP8I2G9KW2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In preface, I'm a network engineer and used to toting about a $2500 Thinkpad issued from corporate.  Build quality is important to me.This model comes 'stripped down' with only 2gb of RAM, and a 'measly' 320gb HDD.Another 2Gb is cheaper than dirt right now.  320GB units are SINGLE PLATTER right now, and very reliable in the mobile context for that reason.Sacrificing these super cheap to upgrade things gets this unit down in to remarkable pricing territory. ( $ 4 5 0 )The 2.2ghz processor has more moxie than those comparing it to the sister model 4520s (i-380 based) give credit for.  Lets keep in mind not too long ago we had similar  performance in Desktops...  The advantage of the (still basic) Radeon 4250 shows in those silly games your kid will download.  You know it will happen and choosing the Intel HD makes children cry.  Also, I have seen no issues with my test 1080p content over HDMI (70-90% CPU).  That said, the screen is x768 so 720p content is the max anyway and it plays fine.The keyboard is good, having not much flex excepting the very center. Typing to the left is difficult for those not used to numpads on these units but humans adapt.  Key travel is crisp and not 'cheap' feeling to me.  In addition, the touchpad is centered on the spacebar (as it should be); but will take getting used to as it's not in the center either.  This implies your instinctual left click might be a right for a couple days.Speaking of the touchpad, people give this some guff in reviews.  Go LOOK at the options panel.  I set palm check to one notch from the top and haven't had a thumb/palm accidental drag once.  Honestly, I think this is a good touchpad after setting sensitivity.This is one of only a couple laptops in this price category that had both HDMI and eSATA.  Bonus.  No USB on the back; however two on each side is good (one doubled with eSATA).  They are inset slightly, so the micro-usb most wireless mice come with now do not protrude at all.Sound is 'ok' but at least it gets loud when you push it.  I can hear the talking in youtube videos fine on 50%, but get an external speaker for $20 if you want to bump it up a notch.  It seems optimized for the human speech range, which I'm pretty ok with.Build quality is solid.  No, really.  Completely lacking in misshapen panels, snap-attached bezels, and the like.  I took it apart and don't find any 'fail' moments in the process.  This is very surprising at this price point.  The consumer version of this HP cpu/featureset is rife with build quality issues so this is important to note.  My wife's friends think we bought a very expensive unit (the only test that matters).Do yourself a favor and buy this model if you're in that sub $500 crunch and don't want to pick up that plastic toshiba thing everybody says has wonky fans.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great laptop for the price", "Author": "JWFlournoy", "ReviewID": "RG8DAX0R83XBW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this laptop as a Christmas gift and was pleased with the performance and features at the $399.00 I paid.I was a little surprised by the size of the laptop.  I guess I wasn't paying attention but the 15.6 inch diagonal results in a very large laptop.I personally prefer a smaller machine (I own a 10\" netbook\" but the person who received it loves the laptop and thinks the size is a plus.  You have plenty of real-estate on the screen for viewing content.  The laptop ended up with an overall Windows Experience rating of 3.2 but that was only for the Aero graphics.  Otherwise it would have been 5.2.  Gaming graphics scored well.

Large screen, comfortable keypad. The only problem I have is the touchpad...very sensitive and interferes with typing.

This slows me down since I often have to reclick and move fingers over on keyboard as well. I have always typed by touch and this makes it much slower.The laptop is excellent in all other ways but I find myself waiting till I get to work to type long responses. Since I basically got this laptop to check email and grade my online students using Blackboard, it is fine.I guess the bottom line is that if you type a considerable amount and right handed, this could be an issue.", "Date": "February 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "My last HP computer, ever. Has a mind of its own.", "Author": "SuperReader", "ReviewID": "R1KMI76G1BJZGT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I ordered this laptop for my dad, who kept it for a day or two and then gave it to me.The pros: This laptop, which I'm using right now, has a very nice, sleek look to it. The top appears to be a brushed metal. The keyboard is spacious and easy to use. It also includes the number pad which is a nice addition to newer laptops.The processor is fast and I like Windows 7 OS. It has a built in card reader which is nice for photographers such as myself to save photos onto the computer. Like some other newer notebooks, the fan is on the side instead of idiotically on the bottom like all my other laptops. The 15 inch screen is a good size. Maybe too big to lug around but nice for home use.The cons: This laptop seems to have a mind of its own. It just does random things all the time. It's very frustrating. You might be in the middle of something and the page will close because you brushed some button. Also, the touchpad is the worst I've ever encountered. It just doesn't have a good feel to it and it's irritating to use. I have a USB mouse I use all the time. And worst thing about this laptop: The charger stopped charging the battery after only a couple of months. I called HP and they sent out a new charger, which I knew wouldn't work and didn't. Something in the computer itself is causing the battery to not charge. The battery was tested and the charger powers the laptop so there ya go. HP was no help at all. I also had this issue with my last HP laptop, a DV1000.For reasons listed above, mainly the battery charging issue, I will never buy another HP product.", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome product", "Author": "RangerOps", "ReviewID": "R35CFWJAJBLR12", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased this a considerable time ago and now we have own it for over a year and I can say I am very happy with its abilities to perform on fiarly mid-high end games with respectable performeance.
