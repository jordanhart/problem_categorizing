(First time buyers beware)", "Author": "Lacy", "ReviewID": "R1WLH4IOLWOCLC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The main reason why I purchased this laptop was to Skype home to my family and friends because I was recently stationed across the country (Air Force problems). I think about after a month it started acting real crappy. My suggestions: Do NOT disturb anything that the computer already came programmed with (i.e. do not delete or uninstall and apps or software), make sure you have a good, up-to-date anti-virus software (the only thing I recommend uninstalling is the Norton it comes with(if you know what you're doing)), and do not just download a bunch of stuff, especially if you do not know what you're doing because it's going to slow it down and mess it up. Also I had a lot of problems with Netflix, the video player wasn't working on the app or online. The apps in general are kind of slow and crappy. Also the built in webcam is not good and I had to purchase a separate one. It was fairly cheap when I bought it so I guess I got what I paid for. A better processor would probably make a good difference.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great for students.", "Author": "anheus79", "ReviewID": "R3TI3ZFHTHX9YJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this as a new school laptop and it works great.

This is the first laptop I have gotten that I would not recommend. First the good, the keyboard. I love Toshiba keyboards. I type about 90 wpm, and so I need a very smooth, high speed keyboard, and this laptop has a good one.The bad- the wifi is super week, and drops the signal where my other laptops on the same table remain well hooked up. On day two, today, the computer was frozen in the morning and needed a hard reboot to start. The mouse freezes all the time and won't release for over 30 seconds,  the computer itself is VERY slow switching between windows.All in all for under 400 bucks it lights up, and what more can I ask for, but I would not buy this model again.One last thing, I know I said I like the keyboard, but I am noticing while writing this review that I strike keys and the keyboard misses them. So, not that impressed with the keyboard either, even though it feels very smooth.", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointing Transaction  Experience", "Author": "J Kelley", "ReviewID": "R18044AWNE0AJN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Horrible experience! Buyers beware. Toshiba Laptop was purchased in August for son at college. Never able to open Windows 365. Toshiba referred us to to a company, Teqkey. Teqkey charged us $100 for one-time diagnostics after which  they said Windows 365 is corrupt, needs to be restarted - but need software key. Key not provided to us by (we thought) Amazon.Amazon points to a company, Two Cougars.  Amazon rep explained that TC is basically the company from which we are purchasing the laptop. Five (5) messages later we are still trying to explain what we need. Nice looking Laptop . If only it was usable. Oh! And if we want to return it? Product must go to Toshiba.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Inexpensive basic laptop.", "Author": "Kimberly A. Hoover \"Gwinny*~~*\"", "ReviewID": "R2F8H890M0J60Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop after my desktop started acting strange. I was paranoid about something happening with my computer, because I am in college so I decided to buy a laptop for school only purposes. So I bought this one. I didn't get it on Amazon. I bought it at Best Buy. It was around the same price, so I figured it was whatever price wise. I wanted something simple. Nothing super fancy with a whole bunch of bells and whistles. This one was cheaper, and had what I was looking for. I am not a fan of windows 8, and beware this is not a touchscreen. It does get the job done however if you just want to browse and use it for simple basic jobs like Facebook surfing, tumblr, Twitter, email, schoolwork with online labs, and word processing, etc... The video can lag a bit. I don't really use it for video so it doesn't bother me in the slightest. Tried out the webcam on skype with a friend and one of the earlier reviewers is right. The webcam is not that great. If you want to use it (the built in webcam), I  recommend trying it first to see if you can deal with the immense video lag, but you may want to look into purchasing a separate one. I have a logitech webcam and it installs and works just fine onto the computer. The screen is bright and sharp. Its not dim that you can't see, and it's not too bright that white backgrounds seem like they are blinding you. Mine has an excellent battery, lasted five hours on a full charge. I was able to get my homework done when that horrible snow storm hit. I live near Philly, so my power was knocked out for days. I was still able to type up essays and save them to my flash drive. The speakers are not the greatest, but if you mostly wear headphones on your laptop like I do, the not so great speakers are not an issue. Overall, it's not a bad little machine if you use it for basic needs. It's not a gaming PC or any type of entertainment laptop. It's just a simple basic laptop. I recommend it for students not looking for a lot of high tech add ons. I have a desktop for that stuff. ^_^ I should also add I have had this laptop for almost a year now, and I have had not a single problem. Works just as good as when I took it out of the box, and just as fast. Hasn't slowed down at all. Just make sure you know what you are looking for when you go to purchase your laptop. It's a very basic laptop. I bought this with that intent in mind since I do nothing but school only work on this.", "Date": "April 12, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00D5GTH3C"}}
