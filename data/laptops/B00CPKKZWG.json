{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Solid laptop", "Author": "Shoefreak", "ReviewID": "RKG3AUM2XG0OH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's a really great laptop with two or three flaws so far.Pros:-Love the backlit keyboard-i7 is pretty fast (admittedly not as fast as I had thought it would be but still pretty fast)-Enough storage (though it is a hybrid drive and not a full SSD)-Optical drive!-Beautiful display with touch-Instant on is great too. I love just opening up and starting to work-Boot time is about 15 secs-Price is pretty reasonable-Windows 8 it pretty nice with a touchscreen laptop-Not too heavy - for a 15 incher it's really lightCons:-Keyboard... The spacebar is kinda iffy. It decides when it wants to press. I have to actively think, \"ok, press spacebar\" to get it to register. The keys themselves are very shallow too. Sometimes I'm not sure if I pressed it and end up repeating letters.-No dedicated graphics - This was the one real Achilles heel but the pros were so many I opted for it anyways.-Battery life is kinda low. I get 3 to 4 hours with everyday use on a single charge.All in all, I'm very happy with my purchase. Haven't seen any games that I want to try out with it yet but I saw when researching that it can manage some light games.NOTE: Also from research, if you want to buy this laptop and switch out the hard drive for an SSD, KEEP THE ORIGINAL DRIVE! It has something to do with restoring. A quick google search will provide more info.Update: 7/7/2013 - Found another con today when I tried to Skype my friend. The webcam is horrible. I was in a pretty well lit room and I looked like a blob of darkness. The mic is fine though. Just something to know if you're a big video-chatter. Not a deal breaker for me though and does not change my four star rating as I was more like four and a half before.", "Date": "July 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's OK", "Author": "CT \"CT\"", "ReviewID": "R3R2EFLI3TH5UF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros:  Boots up quick, backlit keyboard, good sound out of the speakers, touch screen, HDMI out, Can charge devices via USB when off.Cons:  Hardware conflicts and issues in device manager (network) after Vaio update, Sony website hard to navigate to find a fix, graphics could be better when using Video Chat, Battery runs out fast.Recommendation:  Not a bad computer, but wish I would have replaced my old Mac with a new Mac, but figured I'd give a PC one more shot.", "Date": "August 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Loving it so far", "Author": "Joseph C.

The touch screen seems like a little bit of a gimmick, but she reports that she uses it all the time (Windows 8 feature).

My primary use for this laptop is software development. Despite a few flaws, it has made my day to day work more enjoyable and productive overall.Things I like:* Bootup time is very short thanks to the hybrid HDD-SSD.* The touchscreen display is useful in browsing and interacting with touchscreen friendly apps. However, the glossy glass screen is also finger print friendly. So, better have a screen wipe handy at all times.* The 1080p display is very useful for my development work. It took a while to get use to the smaller letters as I choose to work with default display settings in all apps I use. If you have trouble with your eye sight, this form factor may not be ideal.* The backlit keyboard is useful in dark places.* The laptop runs cool despite the powerful processor.* Battery life is decent and has not gone down over the months despite daily charge and use cycles.Things I don't like:* The biggest issue I've had is the wi-fi signal dropping off at least once every few hours with no change in conditions of use. None of the other devices at home would loose connectivity like this from the same location. So, I'm inclined to think that the wireless radio in this laptop is flaky. I do keep up with Sony's software updates using their pre-loaded app.* The display looks good only at a certain angel. If you look at it from even a slight angle, things start to fade out. This is very poor considering the price of the laptop. Most other cheaper laptop brands tend to have much better viewing angles (got a couple in my household to compare).* The letter 'N' in the keyboard has begun to register twice from time to time.* The speakers are less than par. The XLoud feature is a no show with Windows 8.Overall, this laptop has been sufficient for my work. I wouldn't recommend it if your primary use would be entertainment. If you really need a laptop with high performance in processing and disk access, this would fit your needs. I give this 3 stars due to it's higher price and the few issues I've encountered over time.", "Date": "September 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Ultrabook!!!", "Author": "Eduard Jimenez \"Edd\"", "ReviewID": "R36JODZBUJHIRW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent ultrabook, everything I need and more, beautiful screen, large storage, intuitive touchscreen totally recommend this computer,very good building materials, Sony computers in my experience always been an excellent choice.", "Date": "July 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excelent", "Author": "Rubens Musco Mendes", "ReviewID": "RVH86KXU9PYKT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My friends told me that this would be an amazing computer for me.
