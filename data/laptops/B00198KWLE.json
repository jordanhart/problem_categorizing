Shapiro", "ReviewID": "R27WJKKDJON5XE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I can't remember the specifics of the older model Dell laptop I had for four years, but I loved it & it treated me well. The only reason I bought a new one was because the hard drive popped out of the old one, & before I realized it could just be popped back in I had already ordered the 1525.This computer is like an $800 headache. I don't even care that it came with Vista, because honestly it hasn't given me that many problems & I'm not picky about my operating platform, so long as it gets the job done. (Although, I will say, it comes with a completely useless graphics driver, & I had to downgrade to the previous edition of the driver to get basic games to run.) I've been lucky & haven't had the battery or trackpad problems everybody else complains about. But even as one of the \"lucky\" ones, I'd had to deal with my fair share of crap from this model.1. The left mouse button is permanently stuck in the down position. It still functions, but it doesn't have that satisfying \"click\" that mouse buttons are supposed to have. This may sound like a superficial problem, but it's not. You want to know when you've clicked the mouse. As far as I can tell from browsing message boards & forums, everybody who has this computer has this problem. As an Inspiron 1525 owner, it's something you'll just come to accept.2. Like many people have noted, it gets hot. Dangerously hot. Not a \"lap\" top.3. The screen! Bane of my existence!a. First of all, there's no clasp or magnets to ANYTHING to hold the screen down when it's closed. What's up with that, Dell? If you're carrying your laptop in a bag or something the screen just flops around, bouncing as it pleases off the keyboard. Well, you know... WHO EXPECTS LAPTOPS TO BE PORTABLE ANYWAY?b. MAJOR MAJOR HINGE PROBLEMS. I've just spent the last week of my life without a computer at all because I had to order new hinges. The screws holding the display together are so weak & the plastic so flimsy that the metal hinges work themselves out of alignment in no time, causing the laptop to give a mighty CRACK when you open it & eventually causing the metal hinge to become exposed &, in my case, non-functional. This can be dangerous, as the trauma caused by the cracking or hinge popping out can crack the screen. Luckily, my screen was unaffected. But I had to take the whole display apart myself & replace the stupid hinges. Now it's working fine, better than it did when I got it actually -- makes me wonder if the people at Dell even bothered to screw the hinges in all the way or not. But I know this problem will resurface again in no time & need constant surveillance & maintenance. Who needs a laptop they're going to have to dissect every six months? It's ludicrous.You know, I'm absolutely not a picky person. I'm just a regular chick who needs a laptop for work, school, & play. I'm not some tech geek who feels it's my job to complain about every flaw in a gadget in order to make myself feel superior. I am the Everyman. I don't know anything about laptops. All I know is that I have had this computer for a little over a year (ONE YEAR, A SINGLE MEASLY YEAR) & it has caused me nothing but stress. When I buy an expensive electronic, I expect it to work, & not to break until I've dropped it or at least gotten a few good years of use out of it. I don't have money to throw around on upgrades or new equipment. No matter how low the price, this laptop just isn't worth the time, money, or trouble. It's a big, overheating, screen-cracking, mouse-malfunctioning, bulky piece of junk.", "Date": "March 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Horrible product, and even worse customer serivce", "Author": "E.

When I called there they told me to reseat the memory. I did, and the laptop turned back on. I didn't realize that one of the memory chips had burned out completely and it was only running on 1 GB. I should have had 3GB. I didn't realize it until after my warranty was up.  They outsourced their customer service to India. Try getting them to understand anything you are saying. Its like talking to a box of rocks. I'm not a computer genius but even I knew what the problem was. I argued on the phone with him for hours. They are useless.

Dell has dropped the ball completely here.Disclaimer: I currently have a higher end Dell Inspiron with a full Core2Duo/250GB/3GB. I have tried to use the Dell/Best Buy Geek Squad coverage, but this is a un-usable perk, since Dell will do nothing except refer you to Best Buy, who will insist on taking the laptop from you for an indeterminate period (last time it was for 2 months, with them saying they couldn't fix it, and provided another faulty replacement).

For one who is not being completely tech savvy, this was a great starter laptop. It is easy to use and was really affordable for something that was going to get a lot of use out of it. The first year I had it, there was a problem with the hard drive and it had to be replaced but Best Buy and Dell were able to help me out with that and I actually got a better one out of the ordeal while it was covered by the warranty (cha ching!).

My reasons are that Im hard on my computers, they go everywhere with me. This laptop now is almost my stationary computer in my house, its used everyday, rarely ever shut off, and has been put through its trials quite a few times. I have never owned a better laptop.CONS: The case is a bit cheap, where the plastic meets the hinges is an easy place to break, the fan can be quite loud at times, and the laptop is NOT balanced, the back of the laptop and the monitor outweigh the front, so it flops onto its back if its in your lap. Speakers suck too, but I never use them.PROS: Cheap, good for games, pretty quick, 2 headphone ports + mic port, 4 usb ports, easy to work on, cheap to repair, takes just about any hard drive (mine is out of a Mac, running windows xp pro).IF YOU WANT ANYTHING NEWER THAN VISTA, FORGET BUYING THIS COMPUTER", "Date": "April 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "\"Laptop has Excellent Upgrading and Maintenance Abilities\"", "Author": "Emmanuel Andra Wise \"Manbreed AW\"", "ReviewID": "RQLB3LM1RHFV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have bought two of these Laptop's one for me and one for my wife. First thing I did was replace the LED Screens and the inverters , to improve the quality of the view of the Laptops. Then I replaced the fans and upgraded the 1.73 GHz Celeron to 2.0 GHz T7100 Intel Dual Core CPU's for my wife's and Intel T8100 Dual core 2,2GHz  on my Dell and upgraded to 4 Gig of Ram on the Memory. And used a excellent quality of Thermal Paste Cooler Master G7, and replaced the keyboard with a better quality keyboard that interchanges with other Dell laptop's, and then I also replaced the power jack's, so the AC Adapters would be nice and tight,when you plug it in and power it up, and this has been the best laptop I have ever reconditioned. It is blazing fast and I upgraded the Hard Drive to 1TB Western Digital, and purchased a Hard Drive Caddy and mounted a 500 Gig Hard Drive in the DVD Bay, and I have Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit, and Vista Ultimate 32 Bit on the same Laptop. No issues or problems at all. So for the buck it was worth it,and I have a laptop that,is kick ass. And what I love is the HDMI port that comes in handy to hook up a LED TV Monitor it helps for those with eyesight problems like my wife. So, for those who have negative things to say about it it would help if you do some research on the product and see what the Pro's are instead of focusing on the Con's. I like this little laptop so much I plan on tweaking another one\". for what I have done to mine alone just upped the value of this Laptop from $299,00 brand new with just the 1.73 Ghz to $999.00 with two OS's and the upgrades and including new paint job's in reconditioning these Laptop's.

After some comparative shopping, it became clear that Dell could fulfill these requirements better than their competitors.I ordered the Inspiron 1525 with the exact same specifications as those listed on this page, with the exception of a 150GB hard drive, directly from Dell (I would recommend doing the same as, at the time of this posting, the price dealing through Dell directly is almost three hundred dollars cheaper). I was not expecting much for the price, but I have been pleasantly surprised. It should be mentioned that I am by no means a computer expert and I do not use my laptop for anything special outside of work and surfing the internet. However, I do utilize some statistics and data charts that my last laptop labored over while this computer seems to remain unfazed and unburdened. Aside from its speed and power, which I am in no way disappointed with, I also find it to be aesthetically pleasing. The screen is larger and more vivid than I had anticipated, the overall design is sleek, and it will pass as professional. All of this said, it is a good laptop, good looking, handles what I throw at it, and priced to sell at the moment if purchased through Dell.As for the apparent negatives, I have convinced myself that I have only heard so many complaints because I know so many more individuals that own Dells as opposed to any other brand, and have been comforted by a recommendation from a friend who is also a local college's IT supervisor.", "Date": "November 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Not so bad, except...", "Author": "Davey", "ReviewID": "R17JU2299JQ9CM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I only feel compelled to write a review about this computer because of all the bad ones on here. I have had this laptop for a little over two years, and it has survived with few problems. My laptop has a 2.0GHz Core 2 Duo in it, and only 2Gb of ram. When it comes to multitasking, this computer does not shine, but for everyday paper writing and web surfing and the like, its just fine as long as you don't have a million tabs open in your browser. I consider myself a rather tech oriented guy, so a little preventative maintenance was all I needed to keep this computer running. I have not had many of the problems many have, such as the hinge breaking or the mouse buttons sticking. I have watched and monitored my computer for viruses like a hawk, so that has not been a problem. The only problem that has been a pain is that this computer gets very hot, and then overheats and shuts down. I have avoided this by avoiding soft surfaces and putting the computer in powersave mode. It generates much less heat that way. My girlfriend (who also wrote a review about this computer) has had multitudes of problems. I replaced her hard drive and reinstalled vista, and it runs much smoother now. She, however, has had her mouse buttons stick and trackpad go crazy. My trackpad only does this occasionally, so I can, and have lived with it.I have come to play the occasional game on my computer, and that did not end well. I started with Portal 1, and it ran it ok. It was very jittery and full of lag. I took a chance and bought Portal 2, hoping it wouldn't be much more taxing than the first. The only thing that runs ok sometimes is the start menu. If you are looking to play even occasional games, this is not near for you. At this point in time, this laptop would be a second-hand laptop. It has been quickly surpassed by other computers in its price range in a very  short amount of time. I am currently looking and saving for a new laptop.The things I do like are the keyboard and, surprisingly, Vista. With some maintenance and care, vista is not that bad. I prefer Vista's looks over 7's, but 7's functionality. I suppose I will get used to any keyboard that I use over a period of time, but this one seemed just right with good travel of the keys and not a bit of wear and tear yet. The touch sensitive buttons at the top are just an added bonus and have not failed me yet. The headphone port is another complaint I have. Dell has placed them right at the head of the hard drive, and thus, you can hear all the harddrive noise and even some fan noise through the headphones. I have pretty good headphones, and would really appreciate a quality, noise free output for them. I have ended up running most of my audio from a usb port out to a digital 8 channel mixer, then out to my speakers and headphones. This makes for a much cleaner sound when I am at my desk at home.All in all, I am about 4 star happy with its performance over the years, though I would not buy one again. There are many more laptops with greater quality at this price point. I would probably lean toward another manufacturer, in fact.
