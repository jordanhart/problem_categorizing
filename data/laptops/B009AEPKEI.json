For that money, I get more computer than I ever have before. My last machine was an HP Win XP business model with 100GB hard drive, which I got at a discount for $700 five years ago. So I felt really good about how much I was getting for the price.The machine is satisfyingly large without being heavy. It is in fact surprisingly light for the size. It also runs very quietly and doesn't get hot, even sitting on a lap. The case (a semi-shiny black) is a fingerprint magnet, but that's not uncommon these days. The screen is large, bright, and I found no issues with the angle. The keyboard is really nice; it has very shallow key wells, so no little crumbs falling and getting stuck under the keys to get crunched unpleasantly and make them sticky. It is also much slimmer than I expected.I get the griping about the Windows 8 PC/Tablet compromise, but it took me all of five minutes of Googling to find some add-ons and programs to revert to Windows settings I was more comfortable with, as an XP user. There are a number of very nice programs available to add a Start button back in, for example (I chose to use Classic Shell, which also adds more functionality to Win Explorer, but that's just one of many.) I have so far not found that convenient \"Adjust for Best Performance\" setting I used in XP to knock the sleek windows appearance back a bit, but with 6 GB RAM, I haven't found all that fancy animation to affect performance at all. In fact, I had six apps/programs running along and was installing new ones without a hiccup. It is irritating that the Apps don't have an in-program close button, but they can be closed on the left-hand side of the screen. Counter-intuitive but easy enough once figured out.I am a little irked that all the pre-loaded Lenovo apps have no explanations about what they do or a booklet describing them or something. I couldn't even find a description of them on the Lenovo site, and am not inclined to Google each one to figure out whether I need it or not.Overall, I found it to be a wonderful laptop for the money. Time will tell if it proves reliable enough to last years, but my first impression is very positive.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "General Purpose Winner", "Author": "Clarence Earle Younger", "ReviewID": "R3GIGGZOG56NBY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a well designed and powerful laptop for the family.

It works fast and the screen is beautiful. I am not crazy about Windows 8. It is something you need to get used to. You do get used to it though and it seems like all the computers have it now. The speakers are great and loud, however they are underneath the computer which is different. Thank god the speakers are loud though, otherwise it would be a problem. The only bad thing about this computer is I use Skype a lot and the microphone is not good at all. I use my old computer to Skype on though. I hope they fix the problem with the microphone. I was going to give it a 4 star because of Skype/microphone but everything else is so great that I can overlook it for now.

It was an upgrade from a Toshiba I bought 5 years ago.  The screen seems huge, its fast, sleek and very easy to use.  Those are the pros, the cons which their aren't many is that the colour/material used on the top and around the keyboard show every little smudge and fingerprint so it always looks greasy, even though I clean it often with a swiffer cloth.  Really its a minute problem which I can get over considering it has so many other pros.  The operating system however is a different story.  Windows 8 in one word SUCKS.  The charms bar is irritating, and you can't uninstall it, just dismantle part of it but not completely.  If you move your mouse in a certain direction, it pops up and who watches where your mouse is going - this process makes everything slower and its really annoying.  There are way too many screens to get through, not even sure what the point of the tile screen is but don't have a use for that.

Everything works satisfactorily until 4 months later. The laptop wouldn't boot and the error message points at a hard disk drive failure.Request #1: A quick and pleasant call to Lenovo and, two days later, I receive a replacement drive and reinstallation DVDs. The hard drive is used, below the specification of my previous drive... and started to fail noisily in the middle of the reinstallation procedure!Request #2: Calling Lenovo and asking for another drive, which I receive promptly. I install the drive (used parts and below specs again), turn the laptop on and... What's that horrible whining sound?! Conclusion: Yet another failed disk. And to be sure of my diagnostic, I extract an old drive from an old laptop. I successfully reinstall my Lenovo laptop and the old drive.Request #3: Calling Lenovo again. They want me to return the laptop. I make sure they understand the nature of the problem, why returning the laptop makes little sense and why I expect a drive with, at least, the same specifications as the one I originally bought. A week later, the promised drive wasn't there yet (and actually never arrived).Request #4: On the phone with Lenovo... They don't know what happened to the previous drive. They'll send a new one, with the right specifications. I didn't bother opening the drive when I received it, it wasn't the right kind!!! In the meantime, tired of waiting, I had bought a new drive at a local store. Unsurprisingly, it did wonder in my laptop.Request #5: Moving online to avoid being impolite on the phone. There, I go through a weird registration and realized all the limit of their support tools. I almost feel sad for the support people working there. I try my best to describe all the extent of my issues with Lenovo. The field limit to 150 characters don't help, at all. My request: A real solution, in the form of a real drive or a real check to cover the purchase of a new real drive. And, a couple of days later, I receive... an empty box?? After some head-scratching, I understand they want me to return my laptop... #FacePalm!!! It's time to share my story with the Amazonians.Request #6: I'll get to that as soon as I'm done posting this story. I'll update the post if anything interesting happens.If you ever buy the laptop you're looking at, I wish you good luck!------------------------------------[Update: 07/09/2013, Lenovo sent another empty box :-((( I'm done with them!

Learning Windows 8 has been a bit daunting, but it comes after awhile.  The only issue is that to use it with a blue tooth mouse I have to turn off the touchpad (Fn F6) every time it wakes up.  With the touchpad on, the cursor jumps all over the place, not just in a document but to other applications, etc. very erratic. This deletes stuff and you have to always start over.

I purchase the exact laptop with Windows 8 on Black Friday elsewhere for $500. This i5 is dual core not 4 but still has decent speed for what I do.I have a few issues with this one, coming from a XP user.On the password Windows sign in screen, the Easy of access doesn't work right. The Narrator cause the voice instruction to be very erratic from soft to loud and choppy, the space bar doesn't select anything and the Filter Keys selection cause the keyboard unable to type anything. The face recognition icon on the password box does not work. And don't ever forget your password since the Microsoft reset doesn't work either since I never got the reset link from Microsoft - dead in the water. I really didn't forget my password, just wanted to see if it works. This Ease of access would be so freaking cool, if it only works.Ok, working in Windows 8 on the Lenovo was so confusing at first, like giving the key to a Boeing 707 without instructions. Finally starting to get my way around Windows 8, then the keyboard stop working no matter what I do. Got out but needed to do system recovery three times before I got my keyboard back. The Novo button, next to the Power button, so nice with one push and 15 minutes later recover to factory fresh.The OneKey Recovery doesn't work for system backup on the default recovery D partition stating not enough space. Ok, lets try system backup on multiple sets of blank DVDs. That doesn't work either, as it doesn't do multiple disks on this version 8.0. But version 7.0 does multiple disks on Windows 7. Need to backup on an external USB drive. Hope Lenovo debug the OneKey Recovery.Couple of times, Windows 8 update was not successful. No reasons provided, hope its not a software/hardware issue.The other thing is the screen, just poor contrast when viewing straight on like watching TV or in front of the desktop monitor. To get better contrast I needed to rotate the screen back from say 90 degrees (like watching the TV assuming laptop at eye level) to something like 120 degrees to get better contrast. Who want to watch a movie like that? The view angle is very narrow. Other laptops in the show rooms don't have this issue.Need to download Lenovo User Guide 3.0 and buy a Windows 8 book.I get more work done with XP but Windows 8 is more fun to play around with - lots of cool features.
