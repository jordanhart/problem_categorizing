It's very lightweight and I consider the screen the perfect size. It's held up very well. One of the keys has a hairline crack and one of the rubber feet on the bottom fell off but I clean it every month or so and it still looks almost new.My only criticism is that it gets a little warm so I keep it on top of a clipboard when holding it in my lap. No viruses, no crashes, no worries.When netbooks started becoming popular a couple of years ago, I had to laugh because I already have a lightweight, handy netbook. In fact, I'm using it right now to write this review. Given a choice between a new Asus or Dell netbook or a used iBook G4 for the same price, I would take the G4 without thinking about it for a second.", "Date": "March 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best Service", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3KLAVV3QIZBCX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The service I recieved was grade A!

I emailed discount mac depot about the problem and was told to ''unplug it and plug it back in''......REALLY?????

It showed up FILTHY and I couldnt get it to connect to the internet. I took it into Apple and they told me it was put together with random parts and paying to have it operational wouldnt be worth it because it would go awry somewhere else in the machine and never work properly.
