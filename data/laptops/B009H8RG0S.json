{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Powerful and Quality Laptop for a Good Price", "Author": "T. Roberts \"Trexx\"", "ReviewID": "R10Z8407VAV86G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was very skeptical on this purchase because I never heard of MSi computers. Most of the brands I bought in the past were, Toshibas, HPs, and Dell. So needless to say I was a bit apprehensive with this $1500.00 purchase.The main reason for choosing this MSi GT70 is for the amount of RAM. I did compare it with ASUS laptops too, I wanted more than 8 GB. The MSi has 12 GB. I also wanted a powerful graphics card and this one had a GeForce X675m. Although the graphics card only comes with 2 GB of memory this is still vast improvement over my Dell i7core Studio. I do video editing and wanted a powerful machine. The MSi GT70 does the job fine.Games: I'm not a big gamer and this is not the main reason for purchasing this laptop. I did play one game that always crashed on every computer I have owned in the last 10 years. Playing on the GT70 was a pleasure. With turbo boost and manual fan control, it played as smooth as butter. There was not one map scenario I could not play, ...and no crashes.Pre-purchase concerns:1. I read some people were experiencing hinges breaking. This certainly is scary, but is a rare condition - so don't expect this to be a frequent occurring defect and MSI might have corrected the issue by this date.  Google it for more info.2. Unknown brand which I mentioned before.So let me list out the pros and cons as of this date. I'll start with the cons first.Cons:1. Windows 8 was a little tricky at first, I would of rather have windows 7 which is on my Dell and I am familiar with it. However, after a short time of working with it, I found W8 to be very intuitive and perhaps easier to use. It is formatted in an Apps format for the the Windows Start page. This makes customizing possible, but you need to acquire a little practice. See YouTube for demonstration videos!!2. Size: Please don't be fooled by the proportionate dimensions in the picture. This laptop is big! Almost 17 inches long, 11.5 inches deep, 12.5 inches high when open. Large foot print on your desk.3. Weight: At 8.6 lbs this computer is no featherweight. Actually it is lighter than I imagined, and when compared to my Dell 16\" just slightly heavier. But it is heavier and bulkier than most laptops.4. Although MSi has built the machine with some plastic panels and brushed aluminum panels, the plastic looks a little cheap. Although, the black brushed aluminum panels are beautiful.  The plastic casing in not a deal breaker, but slightly noticeable. In addition, when opening the laptop, the inside with the Steelseries keyboard and brush aluminum panel looks high quality.Pros:1. The screen is non-reflective and is not as some reviewers have complained, muddy or grainy. I hardly noticed the matte finish, but I did notice the glare was minimum in the sun. Very nice screen - also reduces eye strain.2. The lighted key board and the Steelseries key board. Well lit and you can change colors of the whole keyboard or just a section. The keyboard is very responsive and feels like a quality keyboard.3. Button on DVD tray - there is still one on the key board to release the tray , but you will have a backup in case the the other goes.4. Very well made. Solid machine for the cost. Built to last.5. A laptop that stays cool! Even using turbo burst I have not had a hot computer playing higher CPU games/video editing. Some say the fan is loud. It is in turbo mode. The fan on my 16 in. Dell Studio was much louder for everyday use.6. DynaAudio - Sounds very good no distortion and the woofer on the bottom of the unit makes a difference. Best sounding laptop without headphones.I will update this review as time goes on. But at this time I am very pleased with this laptop and impressed for what it can do.", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pretty much Awesome!", "Author": "cody p wachs", "ReviewID": "R2BRL6M791UPJT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the money, you really can't beat this computer. It came down to this laptop and the Asus G75VW. The main reason I went with this laptop is because of the mixed reviews of the Asus. This had very good reviews and had alot of neat features. So far I've played Mass Effect 3, Civilization 5, Minecraft and Eve Online and it has played all the games at max settings without a flinch. The ability to control the fan is nice too. After I'm done playing the game I turn the fan on to help cool the computer down faster. The turbo button is nice too, but after some updates mine stopped working. I looked it up in the forums and it said to just reinstall the device driver and it will be ok. Havent done so yet. The keyboard is awesome. Several different colors to choose from and in several configurations. The brushed aluminum that surrounds the keyboard is nice. It stays cool during game play and doesnt heat up your hand. Windows 8 is a trip. Very different from Windows 7 and others, but once you get used to it, it's nice. Some cool features that aren't in 7. The Sound is amazing. I played a video and I thought I was in a surround sound setup. I definatley felt as though I was in the movie. I did however have a hiccup, proably fixable. When i plugged in a set of headphones, the speakers still played. I havent looked into yet, but I'm sure theres a setting I accidentily pressed. Will update later. It is big and a little heavy, but I don't mind. It's what I wanted and I love it. Well that's all I can think of right now. I would definatley reccomend this laptop to anyone.", "Date": "February 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Absolute best Computer for the price.", "Author": "Chronos24", "ReviewID": "R3D955F8D48HSI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like most large purchases I make, I did a LOT  research on this laptop and my decision to buy has not been regretted yet.Pros- Gaming. As listed the GTX675m has worked flawlessly. Playing planet side 2 max settings and this computer hasn't even flinched. My 2008 HP with the gt130m couldn't handle it.Startup- I know win8 has had complaints but I honestly got used to it and it works great and starts up super fast. I counted 16 seconds from cold start.Little bloatware- some people may not know what im talking about but its useless programs that just take up space.Screen- professional reviews say viewing angle is bad but I tried and I think their complaint is a little exaggerated. Screen is also very bright and looks great!Cons- power brick is large but expected for this laptop is expected. Fan- when the fan's turbo mode is on it sounds quite loud but it's also not something that is totally necessary to be used unless heavy gaming otherwise the laptop stays quite cool. This is really a pro more than a con.Camera- LESSON TO LEARN IF YOU BUY; you have to engage the camera for it to work. I think it was fn-f6 to turn the webcam on.All in all this laptop has by far and away been a great laptop. I'm enjoying gaming and ease of use (once you learn win8). I suggest this laptop especially for the price. Compare the specs at this price and I highly doubt you'll find better for the same or cheaper.", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poor external materials and build quality mar what could have been a terrific purchase", "Author": "Erebus", "ReviewID": "R11BDEIL224MZZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this computer expecting something that would last me several years of regular use.  I'm not really much of a gamer, but I work in data security & I need a computer with a bit of horsepower and a stout graphics card /w CUDA.  This computer fit the bill admirably -- it easily handles everything I throw at it.  It works as perfectly today, over six months since my purchase, as it did the day I bought it.Here's how I feel about it now:The good:-The sound system is the best I've ever heard on any laptop.  By a very wide margin, too...!-I've upgraded this system to 16GB RAM and put in an SSD.  It is way faster and more responsive than any desktop I've ever owned.-It plays most games at max settings... with Photoshop, Google Chrome, and a half-dozen other programs running in the background.-The fact that you can control the fan settings & Turbo-boost is really very useful-The keyboard is pretty good.  It could feel more substantial, but I have no real complaints to make against it.  It's very easy to clean, and the backlighting looks cool.-The computer stays cool at (almost) all times.  (And when it heats up, just turn up the fan manually.)  The fan is also very quiet in 'normal' mode.The bad:-The external materials and the finish are TERRIBLE.  Like most people, I rest my hands next to the trackpad when I type.  After a couple months of use, the paint/finish where I rest my hands started coming off.  Now it's completely gone.  There are two giant white spots next to the trackpad, where the black finish just rubbed off.  These areas feel rough to the touch, and they're extremely annoying to say the least.  Truth is that I don't even have particularly sweaty hands, and I don't type THAT often... so this was really quite surprising and disappointing.-The 'shortcut' keys above the keyboard are covered with a very thin layer of shiny plastic, and they get dirty and scratch very easily.  This plastic is also surprisingly difficult to properly clean, and the buttons are a bit overly sensitive.-I have a messed-up speaker jack & a USB Port that doesn't work.  Fortunately, they're both redundant.  Again, just poor build quality at issue here.-Battery life is typically less than an hour... but I suppose that's to be expected....So, to sum it up, the parts are good and the computer is strong as hell, but the build quality and external materials leave much to be desired.  The black \"brushed aluminum\" finish is really just pathetic, as even moderate use will wear it down.Frankly, I wouldn't buy this computer again.  Some of the newer Razer offerings are slightly higher-priced, but are just as powerful, and their build quality is really top-notch.", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing!", "Author": "Quigy", "ReviewID": "RM6JFAYF0WDNA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this product yesterday, after choosing the 1 day shipping.  Lets start off by saying Amazon's customer service is impeccable, and I highly recommend buying from Amazon.  Now to the computer.  I have used this computer, so far, for gaming.  I have tried 2 games, Minecraft and ArmA 2.  With Minecraft, using the 32-bit java(oops) and maxed out settings, I got a steady 70 fps.  Note I used the 32 bit, which drastically lowers fps when on far mode.  I also could not get the fps to drop, which is unbelievable.  On ArmA 2, I was able to play on the max setting again, but since this has a 1080p screen, it hurts your eyes when turning too fast.  So though it can play on max setting easily, it is difficult to see.  As for heating, I think it isn't an issue at all.  I played on this laptop for 5 hours, and virtually no heat was present.  Though I cannot honestly judge heat as I used a cooling pad, which are amazing.  The appearance of the laptop is also great!  I was in awe when first starting up this computer.  It takes around 3 minutes for its first boot up, but once installation is done, it only takes 20 seconds.  The lighted keyboard is very cool and unique.  You are able to change the keyboard with various different colors, and can change it by choosing 1 of 3 rows on an application, and switching the color, with 5 different effects as well.  The outside of the case feels very smooth and sturdy.  There is a large metal plating, surrounded by done sort of strong plastic, giving it a great feel and look.  The battery life is also pretty good, giving you around an hour to two of energy-demanding activities.  The screen is absolutely massive!  I was shocked at how large this computer actually was!  It is fairly large, but pretty light.  The screen looks very nice, and minimal reflections can be seen.  I only have a few small complains about this product.  The drag pad or whatever it is called, is not very responsive while pressing keys alongside it.  This means you will not probably be able to play first person games without a mouse.  Another thing is the keyboard.  I find it very difficult to play on the keyboard, even though it is the size of most other keyboards.  The right side of the keyboard has a shortened shift button.  This causes me to often push the arrow keys next to the right shift button, which interferes with typing.  That is about it for complaints, very minimal.  Windows 8 is also installed on this computer.  Most people will tell you it is terrible, and a waste if time.  Do NOT believe this.  Windows 8 is highly advanced, and takes time to learn, but once you learn how to use windows 8, you'll love it.  It is far superior to windows 7 due to the increased speeds and such.  With the new Windows 8, even Internet explorer isn't terrible!  Plus, personalization is highly valued.  So honestly, don't go for another computer around this price range.  I searched for weeks, and I am very glad I chose to buy this computer.  Buy this laptop from Amazon, and even pick up a cooling pad to eradicate the possibility of over-heating from prolonged use.", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "MSI 17.3 in gaming laptop", "Author": "Josh Phillips", "ReviewID": "R3PVUZSXNSR90O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ive had the laptop for about 2 or 3 days now. When I first got it out of the box it looked awesome. The keyboard is nice to type on, better than my Toshiba. The computer boots up quickly. Windows 8 takes a little getting used to but it isn't to bad once you get the hang of it. Like most Windows OS, you can change the settings to have it set up however you want.When I opened the laptop up, i did notice some scratches on the shortcut keys above the keyboard. The plastic is a soft, easy to mar, touch screen of a sort. I thought they were just smudges and used my shirt to wipe them away and pressed to hard accidentally with my fingernail and left an extra scratch. The laptop does come with protective plastic covering everything but just pressing on this surface with a hard object (like your fingernail) will scratch it easily through the protective plastic. I didn't like this too much. They should have used a harder plastic so that wasn't an issue but I actually can't see it unless it hits the light just right. So you don't even notice it with normal use.Now, other than that, the laptop is great. Super fast, smooth. The graphics card is superb for a laptop. I have yet to tax it on any demanding tasks but once I do some simulations on the graphics card, ill know how good it is. I think i read that it had 384 cores, give or take, so should be quick for parallel processing. Obviously a desktop is better for these things but its nice to have a powerful laptop capable of mobile high processing on the go.ProsQuick, windows 8 actually isn't too bad (i disabled several features however, prob add linux later)Laptop looks beautiful. I pressed around in various spots testing the casing. It didn't give at all. Strong case it seems. Brushed finish shows smudges but unless you plan on never touching your laptop, deal with it.Speakers sound great and the turbo fan is not overly loud. Helps cool tremendously.Keyboard feels awesomeConsSoft plastic covering on the shortcut keys above keyboard. Scratches easily.So far thats the only bad thing Ive noticed.

It plays any game on the market on high/max settings at 60fps no problem. The sound system is great, it has plenty of USB ports, the backlight keyboard is nice and the screen is gorgeous. As far as functionality is concerned, everything is great (except windows 8, but that's just my opinion). However I have had a few problems with it in the last few months (about 8 months after buying it):1. The heat sink system did not keep the laptop cool enough after a few months. I kept this laptop clean as a whistle, well-ventilated, and cooled a little extra using a cooling pad for extra airflow. One day I boot it up and starting playing Fear 3 and wham - the laptop just shut off, no BSOD or anything, and would not turn on. After opening it up and checking under the heat sinks over the CPU and GPU I discovered that a chip on the video card was burned out. I didn't think it was a big deal, as things can just happen. I was a little irritated but I sent in my laptop for RMA and they had it back to me within 30 days (it was over Christmas break and there was a delay in ordering a new video card for it). The trouble began when I got it back.Immediately I noticed a massive performance drop. Almost any game that was somewhat graphically intense (Crysis 3, BF4, etc.) would cause a BSOD due to the GPU overheating. Upon another inspection of the heat sinks I discovered that MSI had used a very low-quality thermal compound to put on the new GPU and it was causing overheating issues that forced the laptop to shut down. No big deal, right? I replaced the thermal compound with AS5 and then I was able to run games with no issue.Then a week later it shut off again. This time when I booted it up, the laptop would not take a charge from the power supply, so I left it off overnight. The next day everything worked fine for a few hours and then it shut off again during Diablo 3 and would not turn on. Surprise, the video card had burned out again, same chip! The rubber/silicone material that separates the heat sink from the chips was burned completely through. Now my laptop is boxed up and ready to be shipped out again. The techs told me that it could be a bad power supply but regardless, I've had nothing but issues with this since the video card first burned out. Great computer when it works but for the last three months it's pretty much been a $1300 basic functions-only laptop and I am not happy. I would recommend not buying it, but if you do, keep an eye on temperatures and make sure you replace the thermal compound every 2-3 months or you will have issues.", "Date": "February 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "DO NOT PURCHASE !!!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1F1XSOUK29Y1V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've had two of these laptops.

At 750MB it seem like plenty of space but with Windows 8, an Ubuntu VM, and all of the documents, videos, and images, that 750MB shrinks really fast.", "Date": "March 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unable to play world of warcraft", "Author": "christopher bennett", "ReviewID": "R196PZ6NJ57E3P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this laptop thinking lid be able to play all my favorite games on it, but I was sorely mistaken it seems as though the network card that is installed in it inhibits you from contacting game servers.

If you have a problem dosen't matter software or hardware you will be required to ship back the computer and PAY the shipping to them yourself. I have had my computer for 4 months and have just spent twenty dollars on top of the 1500 dollars for the computer to get it to them to fix it. Then I was told that I will also have to pay for return shipping also. I do not recommend this computer for anyone. Warranty on this product is none existant as of now. It has been a week since I sent my computer back to MSI. I shipped it via UPS and tracked it. It arrived at MSI on Friday April 5, 2013 at 11:00 am according to UPS as of Monday April 8, 2013 at 5:20 pm when I called for a up date they said they could not even varify that the computer arrived at their location and it would be at least two days before they could tell me that it arrived. Customer service for this company is awful. The people on the phone are rude and do not try to help at all. It seems like you are a bother to them and should not be calling them. I am shill in the process of trying to get my computer fixed and back. So far I wish I could return the computer and buy a different one because of the customer service. With this bad of service I find it hard to beleive that they are a great company.", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Screwed by Windows 8!", "Author": "capt.cm", "ReviewID": "R221M1VSQM0NAQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The computer in itself is not bad, Win 8 is the biggest piece of crap that I have ever had to deal with in over 20 years working with computers. I have spent countless hours learning this horrendous O/S, days of my time in the trash with lost reports, PDF's that went missing, font sizes changing on there own and on and on....  So now I want to un-install this total Microsoft abortion and install Win 7 and MSI tech support tells me I can't due to a conflict that the system will have with the bios. So hey, I'll just install a bios that will work with Win 7 right? MSI tech support tells me \"No can do\" or all will be null and void. So here I am, out a grand and a half and frustrated like never before! Mr Gates, you can stick Win 8 where the sun don't shine!!!!
