This laptop packs a punch! I got it as a one day deal at Woot.com, and of course mine is refurbished, but the quality of this laptop is amazing!I can flip open the lid, swipe my finger, and I have instant access to everything! The touchscreen is nice as well, which works well with Windows 8.1 apps, and Android apps through a third party program Bluestacks. The back lit keyboard is awesome and is neither too dim or too bright. The touchpad took a little getting used to, but it isn't that bad. There is a setting you can use to auto-disable the touchpad when you are using a USB mouse, which is handy. The fingerprint scanner is a nice touch, though I'll admit that after the 8.1 update, the software HP provided stopped working. I didn't have much use for it, and the fingerprint scanner still works for logging in. The camera is top notch, the quality is superb in both taking images and recording/streaming video. Overall, the system is extremely responsive and fast! The quality of the chassis is fantastic, and a few people have asked me about my \"Mac\" haha. The battery life is pretty good, I get about 4 hours on balanced if I am actively using it (I leave the back light on the keyboard on and the screen all the way up... why sacrifice?)The two other large features of this laptop are the screen, and the speakers/headphone jack. The 15.6\" screen included has amazing color and is very close to the LED monitor I have for my desktop. The resolution is decent, if anything, this is my biggest gripe only because I enjoy my 1080 monitor! The speakers are excellent, with the Beats Audio, however the software seems a little less customizable than I expected. Nontheless, my Monster headphones thump pretty well when they are plugged in, and the laptop even recognizes the microphone built into them!I do a little bit of gaming on this laptop, even though it is not quite designed for it. The i7 Processor seems to pick up the slack that the Intel HD Integrated graphics can't for most games. I've played The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim on medium with no issues, Fallout 3 on max with no issues, but I have minor stutters for Saints Row IV on low settings. I haven't played too much with it for games, but I did enjoy Minecraft on the road for roughly 3 hours at maximum settings, and still had two hours of battery life left with the wireless off the entire time.TL;DR* Decent for for most gaming* Great for watching movies* Great battery life* Fast system* Quality buildMy rating:* Quality of build = 5/5* Battery life = 4/5* Screen clarity = 5/5* Speed of laptop = 5/5* Audio quality = 5/5* As a note, make sure if you get this laptop to run all of the Windows Updates, and the HP Updates. There was a BIOS fix that auto-applied through HP's auto update the second week I owned this laptop, prior to that, I had two system freezes when I barely used it. Since then I've had no freezes and the system has been pushed to many limits.", "Date": "May 6, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,099.99", "Features": null, "Name": "Hp Envy 15-j003cl", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5126lwJtntL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00H13TIMU"}}
