Dumas \"Shopping in NY\"", "ReviewID": "R37CNZIOXE3ZB7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a fantastic sub-500 laptop that features a CPU marked at 1.3 Ghz but rated to 1.95 Ghz, and a very nice graphics card for the money.  The hard-drive is relatively small, but is sufficient for most office and school needs.  The 4.5 GB DDR3 RAM is nice also, good for multitasking.  the 15.6 inch screen is fantastic, and has great color depth and, being covered with glass, is easy to clean.  The full sized keyboard is nice, though some buttons are in un-orthodox positions, but they are easy to get accustomed to.  The island style keys help to avoid typos.  The battery life with display turned down is approximately 6 hours with light use, with heavy use (playing medieval 2 total war with volume all the way up, graphics settings all on max, and brightness all the way up) yielded a battery life of about 4 hours, which is phenomenal.  All that being said, the speakers are very sub-par, a trait I have noticed on several of my other Toshiba laptops, and it is recommended that you purchase external powered speakers.  Another minus is that they volume controls and brightness are controlled through some Toshiba program that displays a dark gray bar over things you are working on, and fails to properly initiate sometimes, forcing you to reboot or disable the software (this seems to be one of those flashy things laptop makers include for the \"wow\" factor, similar to HP's quick launch garbage). It comes loaded with a bunch of useless and near-useless bloatware from the manufacturer, like \"Toshiba book place\" which launches by default, and Norton internet security is on there, which is an awful choice, so I just deleted those things and disabled them in start-up through msconfig.  For those interested, it features a wireless card capable of packet injection, works great with Backtrack 5 live CD.  It comes with Windows 7 64bit edition, though it works flawlessly with Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, and FreeBSD (haven't tried Fedora, sorry). No complaints so far, except for the speakers.  Very professional product, great for students and business applications, though gamers will be disappointed, as this can not handle titles published within the past 3 years, but it will run older titles beautifully.  I would recommend it, especially to parents looking to buy their kids a good laptop for college.

I am sticking with Sony from now on, never had any problems with their laptops and they are only a little bit more, but it was a gift so I didn't want to complain. You get what you pay for I guess, and that seems to follow over to customer service as well.  For a company that has been sued before for hinge problems ([...]), you would think they would be nicer to customers calling about them, but no.  Because it doesn't matter how short of a time you have had the laptop, it is apparently normal wear and tear.  So understand Toshiba only expects there laptops to last up to seven months before there are problems.  You have been warned.

But I must askwhat sort of engineers designed such a shoddy excuse for a consumer product.  I have takengreat care of the laptop and most of its life has been spent on a desk where I open and closethe cover.  After a few months i noticed a small screw lying at the bottom of the laptop (whichit turns out was a screw for the flip hinge), and a few weeks later the hinge is broken. Now thehinges on both sides of the laptop are broken and I have not even owned it for a year.  I amextremely dissapointed at how cheaply this piece of garbage has been made.  Of course we live ina plastic world, so buying a plastic computer does not make one wary that it will fall apart afternominal use.  This is an issue of a company trying to sell a cheap product by putting in the mostminimal possible effort to create the product.  I assume Toshiba engineers are not so stupid as tothink that a laptop hinge to support a screen will only require a miniscule screw that you are likelyto find in an eyeglass frame. At this price I would have been better off purchasing an Ipad or aMicrosoft Surface tablet! Toshiba really needs to rethink whom they are fooling by selling cheap products.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good", "Author": "jack", "ReviewID": "RUHMGVE6ZB9LS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had this for over a year now and no problems what so ever, Great buy for the wife she likes it alot.", "Date": "August 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works great", "Author": "cate", "ReviewID": "R28O5FB8JHWNVP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this for perhaps a year and it works very well.

The laptop (for some reason) was delayed a bit in arriving. That was not really an issue because it was not a gift for anyone nor was I really in a hurry for it.When it arrived I was a little disappointed in the feel of it. The quality of the laptop was not what I expected from Toshiba -- a name brand computer. My last laptop was a Dell. My computers at work are Dells, but the reviews on the Toshiba looked good (and the price was very good) so I ordered it. The quality of the materials was an issue here -- the feel of it flimsy -- the mouse pad did not even have a vertical and horizontal bar for scrolling with the fingertips as my Dell laptop has.I ordered a new laptop because my Dell is several years old and I wanted more RAM for faster loading and internet browsing. The difference in the quality of my Dell and this Toshiba product was major.But the reason I returned the Toshiba was the fact that I had a difficult time getting the wireless to connect to the internet -- both at work and at home. When I would finally get it connected, I would be fortunate to have 2-3 minutes before the connection was broken. A computer tech at work said that it might need drivers downloaded even though it was a brand new unit. But how can you download drivers if you can't stay connected to the internet long enough to do so?So I returned the product. And here is where the \"satisfied\" comes in! I rarely have to return a product because I do my homework before I buy, so returning something like a laptop wasn't something I was looking forward to.But I printed out the return labels from Amazon (really, really nice!), took the unit to my UPS store where they packaged it safety for me and returned the unit.Amazon absolutely shines here! I received a confirmation almost immediately of the return and my refund was deposited back to my bank account very quickly!I have been a customer of Amazon.com for many years. I order a lot of stuff from them and now can say that even when you get a \"lemon\" Amazon.com can help you make lemonade!!", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "OK for the price", "Author": "BeckyL", "ReviewID": "R3VK3SXZGD1TFV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this for my son. Only a few problems with it. It got here in OK condition and worked fine. But in installing Linux on it for a dual boot system for him there was an issue as my Linux copy was damaged. In trying to remove the Linux it messed up the hard drive. The recovery partition was not a complete version and the repair disk I had burned when I first got it did not work and was in a foreign language. Since no recovery disks were included and no full recovery partition on it i had to purchase a set of recovery disks from Toshiba and pay 30 bucks. So beware that if you buy another laptop from this person and you have to repair it that it does not have the full recovery options of the factory installed Windows 7. The problems are my own fault, but a user should be able to burn a full recovery disk set or have access to a full recovery partition in case of problems.", "Date": "April 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "At least it looks like my old Toshiba", "Author": "Robbin Myers", "ReviewID": "R2UGYT4Y90F92O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I would recommend a Toshiba computer to anyone.

I've noticed TOshiba typically puts processors with lower speeds in them, and I used to make fun of that, but now, I won't, because there is no need for 2.8GHz in a machine that runs great already with a processor that has less power than a netbook.
