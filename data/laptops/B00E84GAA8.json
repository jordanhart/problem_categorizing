I was afraid of Win 8 because of all the bad publicity I received from friends and other users. I like Win 8 and I was a lover of Win XP. I thought I would never like the system. Boy was I wrong. Im a lover of this PC, it does all I will ever need to do and then some. I recommend it to everyone needing an inexpensive laptop. I have nothing bad to say about it.  A VERY GOOD BUY FOR SCHOOL OR COLLEGE", "Date": "March 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "great product and retailer", "Author": "Andrew Aron", "ReviewID": "R2E1Z5U8X764DE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "everything went well, computer is as good as can be expected and more, very pleased.
