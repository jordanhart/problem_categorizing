Between the two laptops, I see no difference in speed and access time.  They are very fast.  I like the fact the laptop battery provides an elevated position--very convenient.  The sound is great--off course, it's a beats audio.  What can I say?  HP makes great laptops.  For this item, the price is very reasonable.  I saved $200.00 buying it from Amazon.  I saved sales tax as well.", "Date": "October 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "I don't like it", "Author": "Bruce \"Bruce\"", "ReviewID": "R14PYVZFFUSE35", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It's got pretty good battery life, but you'll have 30 minutes of battery left, and the screen will go blank.  I don't like the \"crap ware\" installed, and I don't like the stupid pop-ups from HP that keep popping up.  It does work, but for the price I expected more.  I have no idea why it's so slow, I'll have 2% of the CPU being used, half the memory being used, and it won't respond.  I get frustrated and start beating the keyboard.  I have the feeling I'm going to just throw the damn thing one of these days.  If I had it to do over I'd look at different computers, but I needed one right away so I'm stuck with it.added 5-1-2013Ok, let me add that I'm impressed that an HP rep commented.  I watch movies on it and it's a pretty nice picture.  When I wrote the review I was feeling frustration, which could be due to windows or norton or whatever.  Even though I've beaten the keyboard, it still works.  I'm going to keep it at 3 stars, I'm not real happy with it but it does serve me daily.  Let me add, I'm a retired main-frame database administrator.  It's really frustrating being made to feel stupid.", "Date": "January 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Second hp", "Author": "RMP", "ReviewID": "RLQTYT948P6F6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The order arrived as scheduled and the product was in excellent condition.
