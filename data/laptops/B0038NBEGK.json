{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A little Latitude", "Author": "Rick N.", "ReviewID": "R3J0OYNKMMCVXL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this little laptop to replace my original Latitude D430 which my son finally managed to kill after one too many tosses into the car (though it did survive four years at college.) Since I already had AC adaptors, docking station and DVD drive for it, replacement was a no-brainer.Materials Processing Corporation was clear in their listing - D430, Core 2 Duo 1.3 GHz, 80 GB HD, 2048 MB RAM, and no operating system.  It was shipped, delivered as promised (well packed in bubble wrap). This is not a refurbished unit, but what I'd call \"gently used\" - a few minor scratches and wear marks, but definitely acceptable for the price ($140).I was able to swap in the HD from my old D430 and had this one working in less than three minutes.  I'm a happy customer, thanks to the folks at Materials Processing Corporation.", "Date": "June 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "It was not as described", "Author": "Margie Read \"magnoliamansions\"", "ReviewID": "RRREU1H4QKNBR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We think highly of Dell. This Dell reconditioned computer was described as having XP which is why it was ordered in the first place. It arrived with Win 7. We emailed the selling company but they never acknowledged our email. We called them and a recording said their mail box was full. We will keep the item as we wish to avoid anything with Win 8, but we do not think the seller lived up to the described item. not to communicate was not good customer service either.", "Date": "January 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice little laptop", "Author": "Joey Joe Joe Jr. Shabadoo", "ReviewID": "R32AIHZWS0770C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As long as you understand that you're getting an ultracompact laptop, and that such a machine by necessity has less oomph than a full-size machine, this is a good machine. Given that the tech is a little old now, it's not going to run real fast for you, even with a pretty good chipset (core 2 duo). Windows 7 was really, really slow for me, so I just wiped it and put a linux distro on it. It runs a LOT better without windows.At the price point these are selling for, if you just want something little and convenient for travel, they're a good buy. You're not going to be doing any serious gaming or data-crunching on it, and it's obviously no good for watching DVD's (no optical drive), but if you just want a machine for office-tasks (i.e., word processing and presentations) and email, this is great for that stuff. I wouldn't want it for my primary machine, but as an alternative to the underpowered netbook and overpriced tablets out there, I like it a lot.Oh, and used stuff? Not that big of a deal. For the discount you get buying used electronics, it's worth a little scuffing and grime.", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "FREEZE, FREEZE, FREEZE", "Author": "E.Dehenre", "ReviewID": "RQRDLQD60GHMZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "..I gave this computer 3 stars mostly because  it loves to freeze. Other than the freezing computer it can sometime work... but very slow. And it heats really quickly. Btw don't download ANYTHING!!!

I went to try it first to see if it's working.  My Issues:  I had the hard time locating for the power button.  I was enjoying surfing through the website and one hour later, the laptop completely shut down while it was plugged in and couldn't figure out why. So I went to read other's comments and few of them commented that this laptop will turn off automatically in an hour so it's important that you save your work if you're doing something in Excel or Word.  Dell Latitude D430 Core 2 Duo 1.3Ghz 80Mb 2048Mb Win XP Pro  I don't like this Laptop at all.  It would be very frustrating to keep turning it on.", "Date": "December 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "scam", "Author": "Sommer Martinez", "ReviewID": "R3AV87UZFF64DD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was sold to my 12 year old and she worked very hard for her own money.

I emailed the seller twice about it and still haven't received a response. I bought the computer specifically for that because we wanted something small and portable to use with our DJ equipment and wanted to be able to make CDs for friends. I checked their website and even on their advertised products I found the title saying a computer was 2GB and the product description saying 1GB. Be careful what you buy off of them, if need be try contacting them to make sure that is exactly what you are buying.", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0038NBEGK"}}
