The first Vaio I had died because I left it surrounded by a bed blanket over night and it decided to update during that period of time. Thus burning up the processor.  This one is a great upgrade.  Windows eight was annoying at first but after using the Vaio control center and checking the tutorial it made things so much easier.....Thanks SONY!!!!  I was having trouble figuring out how to scroll but the control center showed me that with the new mouse pad you have to use two fingers in order for the mouse pad to recognize you want to scroll.The computer itself runs windows 8 very smoothly because of the 2.00 Ghz i7. The screen is crystal clear and very bright. I love the illuminated key board it makes typing in the dark so much easier. Another thing that was a bonus for me was I backed up all my files on a hard drive...I plugged it up and the Vaio transferred all my music and pictures effortlessly.  The Vaio app \"Playmemories home\" even organized my pictures in a yearly monthly format.......Say I took a pic in August 12, of 2011. If I click on that specific day on the monthly interface it shows me every pic I took for that day.I also don't have to worry about the computer over heating anymore because the fan has been moved to the top of the Keyboard right under the screen thus keeping the heat of the laptop away from my skin or any blankets lol.....I am having so much fun going threw all the different powerful vaio apps and seeing how useful the are.Excellent buy in my opinion.", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sony VAIO FIT 15 Laptop - CRASH--CRASH--CRASH!!", "Author": "Charles Smith", "ReviewID": "RCS9S0DHIXPUF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Needed a new laptop and purchased a Sony VAIO Fit 15.5 inch Core i7 15218CXB Touch laptop for work.  I was concerned about the graphics processor being shared with the Mobo instead of having a separate GPU like nVidia as I do considerable photo / video / graphics work on the road (i.e. video, Powerpoint, photo editing, etc.)  But was assured that the laptop would handle it all.  Slow(er) hard drive concerned me (5400rpm instead of 7200rpm)  but again was told with Windows 8 and loaded ram I would be ok.I played with the laptop a bit while at home and for the most part it seemed to function ok.  Wasn't really happy with the \"tile-layout\" so I opted for the traditional \"desktop layout\".  I'm sure if all you've ever used is a touch-tablet or touchscreen smartphone,  then you'll probably warm up to the touch-screen / tile layout better but in all honesty...it can be confusing and not-so-user-friendly.On the road,  I was at a big conference where I had to construct client powerpoints each day for next day presentation.  This is where things got disappointing real fast.  Upon ingesting client photos for manipulation... the Sony VAIO started hiccuping... after a certain number of pics ingested... I opened the photo-software and found it to be quite unresponsive compared to other PC's I've had.  Granted these were older PC's (Like a Dell 4600 i5)  but I was expecting this new Sony VAIO to be equally responsive if not \"faster/better\".  It was not.  The problems started after opening Powerpoint and attempting to build slides in a series.  I was able to do it but it was again,  not very responsive. It seemed to have to \"think about\" what to do or as if it were buffering the images even after I reduced their size for faster manipulation.  THEN...CRASH!Locked up... nothing.  So had to do a \"forced power off / reboot\"...  froze up after opening Powerpoint and trying to save slides.  Repeated the process.  Then out of the blue... I get some benign Error message explaining a Hard-Drive Recovery was taking place.  This happened on its own.  I saw a message indicating that this was going to take some time...like 2+ hours.  Great!  So after watching this drag along,  I decided to go for a hot tea and hope that when I came back to my room,  all would be well.  So about an hour or so later I get back and laptop is powered off.  So I power up and nothing... I see a black screen with only the cursor...no log in,  nothing zip, zilch, nada.After forcing power off I do the alt-F8 continually ...had to repeat this process (power off / altF8) several times until I finally got in a \"repair/recovery mode\".  Followed the prompts on the screen and once again... saw a message indicating this was going to take more than a couple hours...EFfffing GREAT!!\" :(  So I decide to call it a night...go to bed and let the laptop attempt to repair itself...hoping it will play nice in the AM.  Woke up and it powered up and seemed to act like it was going to play nice.Tried to do photos in powerpoint...managed to work ok and save to a thumbdrive... all went well.  LATER IN THE DAY.... had to ingest a short video from SD Card... saved it and attempted to do minor edit using the Sony Video Software which came installed on the laptop.Can U say Major CRASH?!!  Sputtered..then froze and was unresponsive.  ARRRGHHH!!!!  :(  Did a force-power off.  BUT couldn't power back on....nothing!  Dead Laptop.  Soooo thinking I could remove the battery to reset the machine...BUT...this is basically a \"SEALED SYSTEM\"  You can't access the battery as in other models as there aren't any latches or access points on the machine...you'd have to get a jeweler's screwdriver and disassemble it!!!! :(  I contacted Sony Tech Support  and they told me to push a \"reset button\" on the \"bottom of laptop\".  Ok...looking at the bottom you don't see anything that even closely resembles a \"reset button\"...what you do see is a tiny...tiny... PINHOLE...yep a PINHOLE.  AND you need to find a really tiny paperclip to carefully press inside the pinhole to \"reset\" the laptop power functions.  (Holy Smokes...what a hot mess this design is!)I pressed the pinhole and was able to power up.  But got a the same dreaded BLACKSCREEN with CURSOR ONLY as before.  I was told to power off and use a \"HELP ASSIST\" button at the top left of keyboard as this is some sort of manual work-around that gets you in the SONY Repair/Recovery Screen Mode.  After pressing the HELP/ASSIST button the laptop booted up and the screen loaded the RECOVERY/REPAIR MODE... Deja Vu ... so I did a complete repair which essentially erased everything from the hard drive  (I backed up my files on an external drive thankfully)  and after about 2+ hours ( I don't know...I left it running in the hotel room to go do some work at the conference).... it was reset to where it was.IN SUMMARY:  I grabbed a colleague's DELL 4600 Windows i5 and did all my photo/video editing, Powerpoint work, etc... AND THEN SOME without fail.  I didn't use the Sony VAIO again and instead returned it.  The insult to injury came when the SONY folks said they'd replace it ... I told them \"thanks but no thanks\"  HOWEVER...they only refunded my money via a SONY GIFT CARD!!! WTH!!!!  :O  Apparently the policy was either replace with equivalent or SONY GIFT CARD ONLY!!! Which means I can only use this for more SONY PRODUCTS at a SONY STORE (where the prices are inflated to begin with).  So I'm more than upset.  I guess when I replace the video camera I'll look at Sony camcorders but as far as their computers are concerned ...no 'effing way!Your mileage may vary but if you plan on using this machine for photo/video/grfx work...you may wind up experiencing what I did.The Sony Sales Rep told me that the new driver updates would take care of all my troubles but I had explained that when I registered my machine....the Laptop auto-updated the drivers so his point was more than moot.

The VAIO actually ranked second (after the Mac).  I don't remember who did the rating--I looked at lots of ratings, and decided this one was the one to go with.  I was switching from a 10-year-old desktop, which finally died.  I have a Dell Inspiron (2008, running Vista), and thought I wanted another Dell, because it would make an easier changeover, and it would have to be replaced eventually.  A friend said the Dell XPS was much better hardware than the Inspiron, but I wasn't ready to spend $1400+ on a new laptop.  So I was glad to get the VAIO for about $1000 (with no interest for 6 months on an Amazon store card).The screen resolution is great, and it boots up very fast.  It has enough USB ports (many laptops only have one or two, this has four, and I need all of them).  In other ways, I've had to work around things. The keyboard initially gave me problems  because of some key locations, and because, even though backlit, it was hard to read the letters (I'm not sure why).  Now I have it hooked to my old keyboard (that's one USB port, the mouse is another, an external drive is a third, and a memory stick is the fourth).  Windows 8 gave me trouble for awhile, but I finally figured out how to work around it (just click on the app that takes you to file explorer and forget about it).  I can't say about battery life, since I usually plug it in to use it.I've had it a month, and have had no problems, so I guess that's a good grade.

However, it crashes way too much for such a new computer. It also takes quite a while to boot. But the worst part is the wifi connection - it is just terrible!

I have been downloading a 30MB application for the past hour now, and that is extremely disappointing when a 200$ computer could do better. It is not my ISP or my Router's problem, as all of the other computers in my house have download speeds around ~5MB/s, while this one gets about .2 MB/s. I have also needed to buy a new router to support this computer, as with my old router from 2012 it was only getting one bar in a two story house while the rest of my computers were getting 4-5 on the wifi. With the new 160$ router, the signal is fine, however the wifi card can't take advantage of the full potential of the router in which my cheaper computers can. This computer takes 30 seconds to load a web page, which is why I found it faster to switch computers to post this review than to continue loading the webpage on that one.Although eight gigabytes of RAM is nice, the rest of the hardware on this computer sucks up battery fast. Under strenuous conditions, this may only last 45 minutes before running out of battery.If you're going to buy this, you may as well buy a 200$ computer, however that is only my experience.

After my son saw my computer, even after hearing me curse my computer several times a day for the past 4 months he wanted one as well. Mainly he wanted the programming that comes with these computers. It is cheaper to buy the computer than to buy the programming. So we both deal with the fact that the wifi card in this computer is rather cheap and troublesome. I still don't recommend this product as a \"Good\" Laptop.

Most laptops that are touchscreen seem to have a glare or maybe just Windows computers I have looked at. One issue I still need to deal with is the battery life as it seems to not last very long at all when you are using it for taking notes in class or just basic computing needs.Overall though, I do think this $1k was spent wisely with buying this computer and I am glad I did.

The practical effect of this is most annoying when I am, for example, on my bank's website and I want to pull up the calculator to do some math.  In Windows 8, I haven't figured out how to do that (and I have tried).

The cool sony software included its awesome for editing videos, specially if you are a digital artist and want to edit recorded painted sessions.I had read people complains and most of them are a bit idiotic. It seems people dont read specifications anymore. Its their fault they didnt read right in the first place. People complaining that screen its reflective its because it has  a glossy screen, it needs to have a nice plastic glass to protect the led from your fingers.People complainign that didnt had enough usb ports, it has enough for me to plug the wacom and extra attachments, people complaining about this are dumd, read specs in the first place.Colors are good on this laptop i was surprised, it doesnt have a good angle like modern ips monitos with more of 170 degress, but it gives you at least 100, especially horizontally, but vertically color shifts a bit, but once you know where to look, you wont have any trouble, i was surprised to see that colors were similar to my profesional cintiq and othe rprofessional dell monitor.Its not the best monitor but colors are not horrible.If you have experience with glossy monitors, you can work prefectly in a room with no lights at the back.In my model came with lights on keyboard, i recomend to make sure your claptop have this, because you will need to be in dark rooms and you need to see your text if you want to see optimal colors onlaptop, on normal daylight it works, all depends on illumination of your room.BEST OF ALL it wont heat up, after a day of use i was surprised it didnt heat up on my desk, also the eliminator box its not that big and doesnt heat up either, my desktop makes more noise than this one, i mean i had volume in 10% and i can even low it more like 5% and still hear videos of youtube because the fan makes no sound at all.My version came with 6 gig of ram and photoshop and painter x3 works like a charm.Im not sure about other people that had problems, but maybe its because of new drivers or not, but my touch screen works like a charm, after downloading the app of netflix its a pleasure to move scrolls.The touch screen saves you TONS  of time, because its easy to move the cursor, saves you tons of time.The design is slim, and looks gorgeous, i got the white version.Battery its really small, you will get battery life like 3 and almost 4 hours of use, but for the size i got no problem. Also it has an nvidia one gig video card for 3d and uses intel for other stuff.I plug it onmy tv and i was surprised how easy the lapto connected to the screen.The sound its gorgeous on this laptop, sounds really really good, and loud.Im in love with the NFC options, i got an experia phone, and when i combine this two its like magic, goodbye cables.No need to install music on laptop you can conect it by blutooth after activating them and share music so easy, so more space for projects and personal works.This is not a rare product, so you can go localy and see it in a store, ask all questions you like, see the screen, look at the usb conections, and dont become one of these people that didnt took 5 minutes to read specifications, this is a solid laptop.I will buy it again.", "Date": "October 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sony VAIO Fit Series SVF15218CXW 15.5-Inch Core i7 Touch Laptop", "Author": "carrot0607", "ReviewID": "RP4JOJGSC2NB4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It was the one which I really want to choose.

I would not buy it again.  At first I thought it was Windows 8 that was the source of the problem, and maybe some of the issues are related to that, but some of them are the hardware.Wireless connection is AWFUL - in the same room as another laptop (Lenovo) this computer's connection is about 30% slower and drops constantly! The other computer and the wireless Roku have NO issues, so it's not the router/connection it's THIS computer.Touch pad/mouse - just awful, barely useable as a mouse - the distinction between 'right' and 'left' click is way over on the side. For someone who is a power user of right click menus and opening things in new windows - not so good. This is not a Win 8 issue as I've been on other laptops running Win 8 without this problem.Freezes and Crashes quite often and/or does not 'wake up' - same programs and content as on my old laptop and yet I have far more freezes and crashes that require hard re-boot on this computer. Sometimes the mouse still works, but everything else is frozen. Ctl+Alt+Delete does nothing. This *may* be Win 8, but I have Win 8 running on a Dell at work and never have this issue. It is not unusual to come back to the computer after several hours and have it not wake up - just stuck on a black screen, hard reboot required.Slow to boot up given its a 'solid state' - I was looking forward to faster boot times with solid state, there is barely any difference and when you factor in how much more you are rebooting due to freezing and losing the wireless connection overall time saved on booting computer - negative.Touch/Screen - it's ok, I'm not an app user or big internet surfer, more a word, excel, one note, visio etc user so its not a 'feature' for me. What I don't like is the shiny of the screen - its distracting to see my reflection all the time. The other user who mentioned its like a mirror is only exaggerating slightly.USB ports - too few of them.Software/device compatibility - this is Win 8's issue, but I'll mention it since that is what you get if you buy this computer.  My 3 year old HP printer and 4 year old nikon camera could not be made to work with this computer. I tried for hours. I want to buy a new color printer, but it seems like many are having issues getting them to work with Win 8 so for now I transfer stuff to the old Win 7 computer to print. PITA.Power connector/cable - its not super tight the cord falls out frequently.*Pros -- Why its getting 3 stars instead of less*- Super light weight- Nice to look at/pretty- Keyboard has nice touch/easy to use (other than the horrible touchpad/mouse)- When its not crashing and freezing it's pretty fast at opening closingWin 8 or Win Hate as I call it - I would give this ZERO STARS- I really really wish I had done more looking around to find a Win 7 laptop with the specs I wanted. When Vista came out, Dell kept building XP computers that folks could by for an extra fee. Hopefully they will start building new Win 7's soon and as much as I am not a fan of Dell, Windows 8 is such a wacko POS I will be moving over. I need a computer to WORK. I don't need a apps to every BS company MS decided to broker a deal with! If I want netflix I will go there, I don't need it pre-installed.

Then it failed to recognize ANY internet connections, even though all other devices in the house continued to work, and finally the touch screen stopped responding.

My Mac lasted 6 years without incident, and this PC can't even make it 20 days???In addition, the computer has several annoying quirks even when it is operating at its best. If you leave your fingers on the touchpad, it will zoom in and out at speeds that do not allow you to choose what size you'd actually like.

Keyboard has a true num-key pad. Sleek design. Small portable charger. Speakers are impressive for a laptop.Cons: ultra high glare touchscreen is more mirror than monitor. The glass on the screen makes the monitor heavier than the keyboard, which causes the laptop to tip easily. Noisy fan. Poor GPU performance.

It took more over three hours on the line with impatient technicians just to get it marginally functioning.-Slow to boot up-SLOW to shut down--the first fit shutdowns, tech support (more on this soon) got tired of waiting after 20 minutes and just had me crash the computer. Since then, I've successfully shut it down once and have had to crash it another four times.-This might be the OS and not the VAIO, but when a program or window is selected, it usually takes several attempts before it works (as in, if you leave it, nothing will happen. You have to prod it like an errant teenager)-VAIO has issues installing its own updates--it will begin install, and at about 95%, fail. A technician got it to finally finish, but when I rebooted, it said the update was installed incorrectly and needed to be done once again-Touchscreen is not very responsive-Less than a week with this laptop and it is making clicking soundsAnd all throughout, tech support has been very curt and only marginally helpful.
