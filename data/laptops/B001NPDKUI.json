The screen is bright and the colors are vivid. I have listened to other laptop speakers, and these sound very good. The keyboard is wonderful to type on. I had to uninstall some bloatware, but that was expected. Will upgrade to a 12 cell battery as soon as I can afford to. I highly recommend this laptop to anyone who wants a well made machine.

Ferrer", "ReviewID": "R1FLNU95GH7ECX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The G70-250US laptop is a very capable laptop but with a 17\" screen it is not a lightweight.  After 3 days of use these are my initial comments. The \"HP Imprint\" silver finish on the keyboard is very smooth which has a glassy feel which I didn't' like initially, but it may grow on me.  The 4 directional keys, which are grouped below the right shift key, are half height keys which seem a little too small. The volume control is a two key operation which uses the left function key and a volume key, and that is a slight annoyance as compared to my other HP laptop (NC6220) which takes only 1 key press.  The speakers and the LCD display perform very well when viewing HD movie trailers and various DVD's. There is nearly 25GB of preloaded software, and I removed about 50% of which I don't care to use or have acquired previously.  Microsoft Vista is a decent OS, however I found a case where it was not compatible with my Netgear WGT624V3 wireless router (search the web for details on making a registry change in Vista).  I'll describe my laptop use to be 70% business, 30%  casual audio/Photoshop editing and web shopping mostly at home.  I'm pretty satisfied with this laptop knowing it's not a stellar performer but capable one for doing ordinary office work and recreational stuff which doesn't require the Intel \"Genius\" processor. It's a pretty good price performer from HP (and my 3rd HP laptop).", "Date": "January 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "absolutely gorgeous!", "Author": "hauntednursery", "ReviewID": "R24U7ZWJJRQE9X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "after careful consideration & tons of research, I bought this laptop direct from the hp website mostly because of the hard drive space & the huge screen. I was a bit worried that i had gotten my hopes up too high but this product absolutely did not disappoint! This is the fourth laptop computer i've owned, the others being two ibms (one bought through my university, it imploded two months after the warranty ran out) & an iBook that i absolutely hated. this computer is by far my favourite. It runs fast, quiet & smooth & the screen has such a brilliant picture! For school i use a lot of (allegedly) very high end computers for Computer Aided Design & Illustration classes, & honestly the picture on this notebook is a thousand times clearer than those more expensive machines. Vista has taken some time to get used to, but eventually i will adjust, just like i did when XP came out. This computer is an absolute steal. It's definitely the best $700 i've ever spent.", "Date": "February 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great basic computer for the money", "Author": "Thousand Oaks PC Club \"BK\"", "ReviewID": "R1IP6HY5NK83NG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop after comparing price/performance for low cost laptops. I ruled out AMD CPUs as comparable Intel mobile processors are faster. I have been using this HP for 10 days and have found it to be an excellent computer after a number of changes as follows:1. Uninstalled all the trial software and other programs I will not use.2. Ran MSConfig, Startup, and removed every program from Startup except the four items for the Intel Graphics processor.3. Went to Administrative Services and comparing it with the recommendations on [...] changed a lot of services from Automatic (startup) to either Manual or Disable. This removed a lot more programs that ran at startup.4. Added a number of new programs that I use.5. Upgraded the memory from 3GB to 4GB.Even before I performed step 5. above, this computer was now very fast  It uses an Intel T4200 mobile dual processor which is only about 8% slower than the Intel T6400 processor featured in most of the higher priced mainstream laptops. If you wish to upgrade memory, there is one step that is not included in any instructions I have seen. After changing a memory module, you must disconnect the hard drive for 5 seconds or more or your computer will not start. I found this out after an hour on the phone with HP tech support. I highly recommend HP tech support as I found them to be knowledgeable even if they are in India. Upgrading the memory will not void your warranty. One thing to note - the HP warranty is 90 days with HP paying for shipping both ways, labor and materials. After that for the balance of one year you pay shipping and labor and HP pays for parts.Everything works well, from easy wireless connection to the modem, etc. I like everything about this laptop and recommend it if you can buy it a low price. HP has a rebate on this computer until June 27th, and also offers a full or partial rebate on certain HP printers when you buy this computer.", "Date": "May 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best PC for that price!", "Author": "Sergio Granados", "ReviewID": "RQ2YBO8AXKETX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all.., I've been an Apple computer user (lover) for almost 10 years that swear never to go back to PC.., however,  due to a change of career and compatibility reasons  I had to buy a PC.., I was SUPER hesitant, so after a couple of weeks of research I decided to go for the HP G70.., I use it to run a full version of AutoCAD 2008 on Vista for 3D mapping and engineering design and I can just say I'm more than happy, It has been the best buy ever!..

Approximately 8 months into it, the hinge system started falling apart on the left hand side.  I entered into a chat session with customer service.  They sent a box to pack the computer in to send in for repairs under the warranty.  I received a call from a case manager who accused me of dropping the laptop and said that \"even if what I said were the truth\" and it wasn't dropped, it wouldn't be covered anyway because it would be considered normal wear and tear.  He wanted over $400 to repair the computer.  I told him to just send it back to me.  Upon receiving it, my lcd screen is now broken.  Believe it or not, they will not accept any responsibility for the damage to my computer.  2 out of 3 of the customer service reps I spoke with in the repair division were incredibly rude.  I am not an engineer but even I know that this is a design flaw.  The lcd screen is just too heavy for the hinge system to survive over a very long period of time with even minimal use.  I couldn't be any more disappointed in a company.  They will not take responsbility for their own faulty product.  In my case, to make an even bad situation worse, they caused further damage and won't even make any effort to correct the problem.

Vertical and horizontal lines on the screen.  When I sent it back to HP for my warranty they said the damage was my fault and would cost me $435.00 dollars to fix.  By looking at other web posts I have found out that this is the standard response to anything you want fixed by your warranty.  If you buy an HP just remember your warranty is worthless.  If you notice when you open this laptop the LCD screen is very flimsy.  This seems to be a terrible engineering design.  Maybe this is what led to the LCD screen going bad.  It appears to me that the LCD could easily be damaged under normal use which happened evidently to me.  The reason HP computers cost less than other brands is because they evidently don't have to support there warrranty or pay much for there engineering.", "Date": "July 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "best notebook ever", "Author": "L.

I had narrowed it down to this one and Acer which my daughter has and likes.  Acer and HP are both good brands but the keyboard on the HP convinced me to buy this one.  I wanted silver keys with silky smooth feeling and I got that with the HP Pavilion G-60.  The keyboard has 10 key which is a must for me.  The keys work very smoothly and don't show fingerprints.  I like the widescreen, it gives a more complete and comfortable view.  I basically wanted a laptop of my own to organize our photos and e-mail and shop on line. I let my husband take over our pc.

So far the only problem I had was with the battery. When plugged in one day the power light kept blinking and it said my battery was not charging. I called HP and was sent a new battery free of charge. Then when I received the new battery it did it again, HP told me to take the battery out and hold the power button for 45 seconds. This seemed to work until a few days later it started acting up again. I have noticed that it only does this if the laptop gets too hot, so this is probably my fault bc Im always sitting in bed with it and my comforter blocks the fan. After unblocking the fan it works and charges just fine...so maybe this is some kind of safety measure? Anyways, one feature that I would like for this laptop to have is a backlit keyboard and a better placement of the powersource cord (it sticks out on the side and gets caught on stuff). Other than that this computer has yet to do me wrong. When you get it just make sure to clean out the bloatware bc this baby is loaded with it! If you have pets that like to jump in your lap while on the computer be wary bc my five month old pug jumped on my lap and when she slid off she popped off the right arrow key and broke the plastic retainer (its been hell finding a replacement). The finish of this laptop is beautiful but it is easily dirtied by fingerprints and dust, as well as the screen. I have yet to burn dvds or cds on here but Im sure it wont be a problem. I dont see why everyone hates Vista b/c I have used every new version since Windows 95 and I adapted to this like a fish in water...just be careful not to accidentally delete the trashcan bc once you do and you get it back it somehow loses its \"brain\" and the icon is forever empty or full lol.

Program installs proceed without hiccups.

Excellent price for a spanking new machine, especially 3 years ago as price inflation goes etc. (I see its $949.00 from some other sellers than Amazon Directly now, hmmm...perhaps that itself shows what a reliable, and nice to use machine it is, as it costs like $300.00 more now than it did for me when it was a new product on the market, or maybe mine was made better at the time...)
