{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fair Deal", "Author": "Ted", "ReviewID": "R29HEY44IDT21H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Toshiba Satellite series are one of my favorite laptop due to it's price-efficiency margin. Certainly you won't expect top performance over a small - medium budget laptop, but for a $600 laptop with 17\" monitor and hardware compatible to other overpriced laptop like so*y, this laptop is a steal on the modern market.It might be an illusion that the more expensive laptop is far superior than the average-priced one. Although I've consider myself as an armature in computer science, allow me to give a few words about laptops available on the market; Be it a two-thousand dollars A*US mobile gaming platform or a three-hundred dollars on-the-go mini books, they all equipped with horrifying graphic cards THAT WILL drag down the laptop performance TO THE SAME LEVEL. Nevertheless the depreciation of electronics were always at a great speed, processor and graphics usually dies with a cycle of 18 months and it's inadvisable to invest heavily on one or two hardware. Surely a laptop that cost $500 more might get a program open a little bit faster, but the Satellite Series were one of the laptops you may find with fair value and affordable enough to be replaced when outdated.Drawback? Yes. Toshiba laptop comes with a few bugs and a bunch of useless software with it. But they're quite an easy fix if you wanted to.", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Stopped charging battery", "Author": "Mike Gollub", "ReviewID": "RBYTL79WAVZWU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've had plenty of headaches using this, but most were related to Windows 8 which has no place on a laptop or desktop.  Some other problems had to do with the effort to get a dual-boot going.What prompted my review is that after a little over a year using this machine as a desktop, the battery was no longer charging.  Toshiba support showed me no sympathy as I was past warranty, and the repair place I tried said I'd need to get the motherboard replaced at a cost of $350.Time for a new (non-Toshiba) laptop.  Recommendations welcomed.Outside of the charger issues it's a decent machine.  I like the full-sized slightly-flimsy keyboard, but I may go a little smaller next time so I can use it on the train.", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Outstanding", "Author": "ruhape_99", "ReviewID": "R22V14PVEFMYQW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Outstanding. It works super quick, as long as your internet connection can handle it.  As a work horse its there.  There are no fancy things like touch screen and stupid stuff like that that drop your core to an Ie 5 core. HD video is nice, and Picture from U Tube is Outstanding.. Using it with my T.V. has worked well with a wifi device camping.", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beautiful, Fast Laptop - perfect desktop replacement", "Author": "candace", "ReviewID": "R16K1TO9SIDRU8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is fantastic. Fast processor, lots of storage, big, beautiful, crystal clear. The Windows 8 OS takes a little while to get used to, but once you understand it, it's AWESOME! There are so many features that other laptops don't have. This is like the Ferrari of laptops and you have to learn what all the gauges and buttons do.I bought this as a desktop replacement that I can transport if I want to. I was thinking about blogging full-time and doing photoshop/illustration work when I bought it. It's been great so far.", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "TERRIBLE!", "Author": "Pilot Colin Hudson", "ReviewID": "R3RXI1SJ5KQTD1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've had problems since first start up and terrible customer support...
