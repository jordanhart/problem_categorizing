{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice laptop computer", "Author": "Kyle L Lindstrom", "ReviewID": "R1XEUT90ICJL3L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After going through all the specs on various computers this is the one I decided on. I searched Best Buy, Tiger Direct, etc.. and Amazon had the same exact computer for $50 less and I also have Amazon Prime so it was a win, win. I like how light the computer is, in the past I have travelled with a laptop and the weight was a big issue. I was trying to avoid buying a Windows 8 system but then I found the app called START 8 so I decided to try Windows 8. Start 8 makes your desktop identical to the old Windows 7 so I didn't waste any time going to Windows 8. System is fast, starts up very quick and screen is very clear. Keyboard is nice and responsive. I don't rarely use the touch pad so I can't rate how I like it. I also like the battery connection to the laptop. My old Toshiba had a loose connection right from the start and didn't like it. The battery life is also pretty good. If there is one thing I could change it would be a longer power cord, it could use an extra 2 ft. I would recommend this computer to others.", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "good", "Author": "txt", "ReviewID": "R1HZOVOKZ0PSC0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is purchased for my college. So far so GOOD! I love the product and it's solid. The Windows 8 is very different than Windows 7. I am beginning to catch on to all the differences, and some of them appear to be practical. The laptop itself is quick. My only suggestion is to learn to use your computer before you decide to not like it. Once you get use to it, then decide if you don't like it.", "Date": "August 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "great computer", "Author": "TODDJELF", "ReviewID": "R151BKHISC00S7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this computer it has everything that I need for school.

Stapp \"time will tell\"", "ReviewID": "R2XKM5SOT3YDPX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I received the computer yesterday and immediately started to get it set up.  On first power up I found the touch pad mouse pointer would 'shiver' while I moved it across the screen.  The pointer wiggle was worse when I was touching the center of the pad.  I continued on until I could adjust the mouse settings and I changed the sensitivity and other settings, but this didn't help.  I restarted the computer, but problem continued.  I reset the computer to its factory boot-up settings and problem disappeared!  Unfortunately, after the computer ran one hour the cursor started wiggling again.  I will ASSUME my experience is rare because I found no other similar issues reported like this online.  Nevertheless I returned the computer.  I don't have time for startup issues so early in the game.", "Date": "May 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Laptop was good.", "Author": "Shun", "ReviewID": "R1QOZFTUC9JKG0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Its an average performance laptop.

Then finally the hinges appeared that It will come out if we press hard to close the LCD. Then we reported the problem to Dell and they created report and sent us Dell Depot Box with shipping label and during the entire they were prompt and quick. The Trouble started when the laptop reached the Repair Depot and I got a call that the hinges were not covered under warranty it has been put on hold. I was asked to pay $179.00 to get it repaired then I denied it as I was never informed earlier that hinges are not covered. I was told that my Laptop will be returned unrepaired on 07/17/2013. I didn't get any information on Laptop being shipped till 7/24/2013 and the repair depot status was showing that the Laptop is being repaired after released from hold. I called customer center and they said that it is not getting repaired and it will be send unrepaired. After so many follow-ups they sent back my Laptop which improperly packed and LCD broken by Dell.I have written to Dell Director - Customer care but till no positive response.Let me mention here that same Laptop had issue with Motherboard too which was replaced after 2 months of online troubleshooting.I never expected this unprofessional behavior from Dell that they will break my Laptop when I denied to pay extra being covered in Warranty.One of the Out Of warranty representative staff mentioned me that they can't return the Laptop in same condition in threatening way that If I do not pay $179 for which they said is not covered by warranty they can't return the Laptop in same condition in which sent.So now I have a Broken Laptop (Broken by Dell) which was unrepaired and I am not sure whom to contact for my grievances.At least I would never suggest any one to buy even a small part from Dell.---------------I got several calls and emails from Dell after I raised complaint with BBB about my Laptop broken by Dell Depot and they told that my Laptop LCD, Heat Sink, Hinges, Bracets are broken which needs replacement and they just need $179.00 as Diagonostic charge and they are not charging any thing for Part. Let me tell you that I have repaired my Laptop myself after going through manuals only thing which needed replacement was Laptop Base costing $16.00 which too was broken by Dell repair Depot(They took 12 days to Diagnose or say break my Laptop).So if I would have not have repaired my Laptop myself, I would have ended Paying $179.00 (Instead of $16.00) plus Taxes. Dell stop cheating your Customers please.Original Review link: http://www.amazon.com/review/R2002JCN8VMM6Q?_encoding=UTF8&asin;=B009FX7DGW&cdForum;=Fx1GNCQS2Y27IVA&cdMSG;=addedToThread&cdPage;=&cdThread;=Tx5MR0H0JUIZAR&newContentID;=Mx1KPHAV0LUAMLV&newContentNum;=2&store;=pc#CustomerDiscussionsNRPB", "Date": "July 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "New to laptops", "Author": "Diane Johnson", "ReviewID": "R2R6G0RRKK5MU8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far, I like this computer.
