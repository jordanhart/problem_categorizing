I have used Window operating systems since the early days of Microsoft.  This is by far the harder system to learn.  In my opinon the touchscreen is essential to a smooth transition to Windows 8 and this computer does a great job of providing that requirement.  It loads fast and operated fast.  I have had no problems with the computer in the 2 months I have owned it.  I believe that once I learn the operating system completely, I will be completely satisfied.  If an old dog over 70 yrs old can learn it - anyone can.", "Date": "April 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop!", "Author": "Garrett Dunn", "ReviewID": "R2ZSFTN4UJB3ZF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been without a computer for a few years now, so I decided to get this laptop. It's very very fast, audio is great, webcam is awesome, touch screen is very responsive. I don't have a single complaint. Best purchase I've made in a while. I haven't tried gaming or anything extreme but if you're looking for a computer/laptop to check e-mails, facebook, light gaming, watch movies, you-tube videos, do your work, and things like that, this is the one for you. :) *Very Satisfied*", "Date": "May 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Has all the right features!", "Author": "Emissary52", "ReviewID": "RHHVRGH91YXNP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was planning to get this model from Amazon and found it for $399 from OfficeMax. Being a bargain-hunter, I went for it. At Amazon's current price, it is still a bargain. This model has the 4th generation Haswell chip from Intel, the Core I3 4010U and it is significantly faster than the other Dell models that have the slower Pentium chips in them. If you're cross-shopping similarly priced models from HP, Asus or Acer to name a few, stay away from those models that are powered by AMD A4's AMD A6's and Celeron models. Those chips are a bit on the slow side, and coupled with 4 GB of ram and 5400 RPM hard drives make Windows 8.1 a less enjoyable experience.This model Dell even with the standard 4GB and 500GB 5400 RPM drive makes for a very good \"all-purpose\" machine that will serve well the vast majority of people who will purchase it. The integrated Intel 4400 Graphics chip, which uses system memory is even good enough for light gaming, but if you're a \"dedicated gamer\" this machine is not for you! The recent Windows 8.1 update which came out April 10th make Windows 8.1 even better. Now, you can use a mouse and keyboard or the Touchscreen with almost equal ease. I hated the original Windows 8, but Windows 8.1 is a lot easier to deal with!!This model has 4 USB ports - 2 USB 3.0 and 2 USB 2.0. Unlike many lower-priced laptops, it still has a DVD/CD optical drive. Several other Dell models that look very much like this unit, do not have a DVD/CD optical drive and many buyers are disappointed to discover that after their purchase. It also has an RJ-45 jack and HDMI port so you can hook it to the TV. It does not have a VGA port, however, so if you're thinking about hooking it up to an old monitor ...you'd be out of luck.It does come with a removable battery and has a panel on the bottom to allow access to the 2 memory slots and the hard drive. Just today, I added an 8GB Crucial module to this unit and it took all of 5 minutes. So now I have 12 GB of memory which does make this Inspiron a wee bit faster. If you go to Dell's website to check on driver updates you won't find it listed as an i15RVT-6195BLK, but as a more generic Inspiron 3537. I don't know why Dell does this, but they do! Down the road, I may buy an SSD drive for this to turn it into a poor man's ultrabook!To sum up, if you're looking for an everyday computer that can perform most tasks and run most programs in a more than adequate manner, keep this model on your short list!", "Date": "May 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Value for Money", "Author": "Ram", "ReviewID": "R15HYZETZBZLEO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Rather I was expecting too much from the display, the images are OK and not of the quality of an LED screen.

It's a mess!!!).  This computer has already been frustrating to me and we've only had it a week.  The i3 processor is so much slower than the i5 processor that is on my mother in law's laptop that we paid the same amount for.  I wouldn't recommend it.  It locked up on me the very first day I started using it.  We're using this computer for our elementary age children--to learn to type and do kid-safe internet research via kidrex(dot)org.  But, this computer really is much slower than I expected it to be.  For the same price, we purchased a Toshiba laptop for my mother in law with more memory and an i5 processor.  She's VERY happy with it.  We, on the other hand, would not recommend this computer--which costs the same amount of money.I don't even want to think about having to deal with Dell customer service if my computer breaks...  ugh....  Go with another brand and stay away from Dell.  Several computer folks who work at different stores have all confirmed that something happened at Dell in the past two years and they are now very difficult to deal with.  So, save yourself some frustration and don't get this computer.  Unfortunately, we're going to be stuck with it until it dies...", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Purchased for Daughter", "Author": "Clare Welch", "ReviewID": "R2R75CDTBXMVYG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off Thank You for such prompt service.

The touch screen, decent speed for the price. It had asked that I store the factory settings so that it could maintain factory settings. It's equivalent to the famous one button reset on other brands. So I got an External Hard drive- but that wouldn't work because I had to buy a Dell subscription thing in order to sore it on anything other than a usb device. How many people have a 20gb usb device? So by the time I buy the USB device, it already slowed down and seemed to have aged far past it's prime. Moreover random lint gets caught behind the touchscreen. Perhaps this one is defective and needs to be returned.
