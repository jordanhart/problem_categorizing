I bought 2 of these and am very pleased!  They are heavier than what we're used to, but then the screen size is much larger than what we're used to.  My only complaint is Windows 8, but that's not a laptop issue.  I am glad that I made this purchase and would certainly recommend!", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Solid, versatile, all-around computer", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R3LDM9L0Y2NBBH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The specs vs price is what attracted me buy this computer after weeks of research.  This laptop is on the larger, heavier side so it's ideal for home use and not so much for traveling.  Overall construction has a robust feel and is well made.  The screen is large and bright--but most notably, the speakers are excellent for its size.  This comes with Windows 8, which takes a little getting use to.  I recommend tweaking the settings for maximum performance.  The 6GB RAM speed is excellent for gaming too.  I'm not a heavy gamer, but I play Call of Duty and other games with no problems.  Some draw backs are keyboard location in relation to the touch pad; like most laptops it is natural to drop your hand while typing causing inadvertent input to the touch pad.  For some reason, I do this more than any other laptops I've use which can be very frustrating--especially with Windows 8. The processing speed is more than enough for any typical user to satisfy.  Overall, this an excellent buy when you consider the price you get.  The best characteristic about this laptop is its versatility--it can do everything well.", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "very nice", "Author": "lydia griffin", "ReviewID": "R2Y0TTFT6B20AS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it was a present and they are enjoying it.

Nice high def wide screen. Good, functional apps but not entirely crazy about Windows 8 and some of the pre-installed apps. May want to download free mail app, browser and graphics editor like I did. Also, may want different video players. The hardware is nice. Windows 8 is a shift to a more mobile friendly environment but the desktop is still there as another app. Most of the apps that run under the new start shell are streamlined, without many options, and geared to the cloud. But versions of the more familiar desktop applications are available and run nice on this PC.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great computer, great price", "Author": "Ryan Mcknight", "ReviewID": "R1N8F78CLYKIUK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this as a Christmas present for my husband. It has a good amount of memory, a disk drive(which is becoming harder to find), and a web cam. The computer works great for Skyping and watching tv shows and movies! Smooth video and audio.
