I had it for around 2 years and finally I had had enough of it. I found this laptop here on amazon and then I was told that it was cheaper on best buy. I placed the order on best buy and I had it expressed. a day later I was told that it was back-ordered so I called in to cancel the order. I cancelled it over the phone and then placed a new order for this laptop. a few days later I was told that both laptops had shipped out. finally I got everything figured out and returned the original laptop.now for the review:I really love everything about it. my old hp laptop used to overheat like crazy but because this laptop's \"vent\" (for lack of a better word) is on the side it never overheats. the sound is great. windows 7 is beautiful. and the best part about it is that it is really light. I can close it and carry it to another place without any problem (unlike my old laptop which weighed a whopping 8.5 lbs. I also like that the keyboard's keys have spaces between them. the plug also has a cool hard thing that is in the shape of an 'L' and that way the plug doesn't have to bend and break. it has 4 USB jacks and the DVD player is really nice.the webcam's quality is really great (has a slight buzzy sound but besides for that its really good)", "Date": "September 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Happy to be back with Sony", "Author": "Samsneet", "ReviewID": "R2SK0QBMIB2T53", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a vaio about 10 years ago that got stolen, and since then i've bought less expensive hp laptops.  When i found the vpcee22fx model on sale, i bought it, and from the second i opened it up i could feel the difference.  Everything is easy, there's no extra wasted space on the keyboard platform, and everything just feels right.  Granted i've only had it for two days now, but so far i'm really happy.  Even the way the keys click and the spacing of the keys.  anyway, enough...i'm just happy to be back with a sony.  I thought that since this one was priced so low that i might not be happy with it, but its not the case at all.  I would recommend this to anyone", "Date": "August 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Terrible!!!!", "Author": "Bella", "ReviewID": "R11D9DUZLSRGAS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I did recieve my laptop really fast but it only worked for one day!!!!
