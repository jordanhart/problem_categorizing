Formatted it and installed XP, and now the lenovo-downloaded drivers won't work(half-useless).  Their \"legendary\" tech support told me to take a hike because I wasn't using the preload anymore(even though it was a completely clean install).  I told them \"hey, you can spend 15 minutes helping me get these drivers working on XP, or you can spend 3 hours trying to get my programs to work on Vista\".  Of course, they laughed and told me to play on the freeway.  <sigh> Going to try Linux... I figure it can't get much worse than this?", "Date": "February 26, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000KZAKIW"}}
