It's so hard to click on anything that it's pretty much useless. I've tweak every possible mouse config settings, to no avail.Of course, the problem is easily solved by purchasing an external USB mouse, I just wonder how could a giant like sony produce such a dumb design and tout it as an innovation? sometimes we just need things that work, if you innovate by breaking existing functionality, it's only gonna frustrate users.", "Date": "July 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "I have had my Vaio since the beginning of August...", "Author": "APH", "ReviewID": "R16G50WXYLM7C7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "and I love it. I have had many laptops, from just about every manufacturer, including HP / Compaq, Gateway, Apple, Dell, and Toshiba. I am hard on my laptops. I have high expectations for them... not only do I do basic computing on them, like web browsing and e-mail, but I also tend to play games on them. A lot.This Vaio, even though it only has HD 3000 graphics, has run Guild Wars 2, Fallout New Vegas, World of Warcraft, and Skyrim very well. Granted, it will not perform like an i7 with 8 gigs of RAM backed up by a 1 gig Radeon HD 6770, but I maintain 30 fps on Guild Wars 2 in the larger battles.Heat is rarely an issue. I have monitored the temperature of the laptop and it has reached a max. temp of 68 degrees Celsius thus far during heavy gaming.The sleep ---> wake cycle is really fast, and I am happy with the battery life (~3 hours if I don't do anything crazy with it). I have gotten compliments on it (Mostly that it looks like a MacBook pro... At a fraction of the cost, LOL). The chiclet keyboard is very much like the keyboard on my old MBP, and I like it quite a lot. I can't speak to others' concerns about the trackpad as I always use a Micro USB wireless Darkfield mouse but the few times I have used the trackpad, it hasn't been something where I was like, \"Oh man, this is horrible!\" So... if a track pad is really that important to you, I guess you can look elsewhere?Anyway, for the money, this is a solid performer that not only runs well, but also LOOKS good, and really, when it comes down to brass tacks... we all like a stylish product.", "Date": "September 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "boomer", "ReviewID": "R3IYRTUDZC816B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this laptop the week it came out. Works great for surfing the web or watching dvds. Not sure if the other guy got a bad one but i love the touchpad you dont even have to click it just hold one finger on the button and tap the other part of the touchpad.

The click pad was over-exaggerated as an annoyance but it works perfectly fine for me.  I also love the back lit keyboard, its not that bright and automatically dims after a moment on no activity.  I also love the feel of the keys, it is soft to the touch with no \"clicky\" sound.

After 30 days the hard drive went out. I though it was no big deal as stuff happens. Figured it would be easy to get it repaired under warranty. Boy, was I wrong.  Wait till you attempt to get someting repaired by Sony under their warranty. The run around does not even begin to explain the hassell you have to go through. finally gave up and took it to GTeek Squad and had a new hard drive put in for $250.00.

I will sway anyone I can from purchasing anyting from them.", "Date": "October 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your money on a Sony Vaio!", "Author": "Pam", "ReviewID": "R3BIAI7DDJNB7P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "There was a day when you could count on the name \"Sony\" and a \"Viao\" was a highly rated product.Not any more!!  I didn't even have my Sony Vaio for 18 months when it wouldn't take a charge.  I had it checked out and was told by the seller that the repairs would cost more than the computer was worth.  So I have to simply trash it.  I have nothing whatsoever positive to say about this product.  Buyer Beware!!", "Date": "September 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't get this", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R7VEAH7J1HMMG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I used credit card points to acquire this computer as my 4 year old HP was on its last legs. This computer isn't worth the cardboard it was shipped in.After start up, I tried to install normal programs, iTunes, CCleaner, FireFox, etc. The installation process took forever and kept freezing to where I had to use Task Manager to close the programs. I then started to delete the Sony software which took another 45 minutes. That did the trick where I was finally able to install standard programs. While I understand Sony's desire to have an all-in-one viewing experience, I don't see a reason to have a PS3 remote on a laptop.But the installation process wasn't bad enough. The touchpad is flat out awful. There is no native right-click and instead of opening in \"new tabs,\" I am almost always opening something in the same tab. Very, very annoying to navigate. Forget about scrolling with the touchpad, I found it easier to use the up & down arrow keys. Most annoying aspect of the touchpad is that sometimes, some links or programs would require a single click to open, others a double click. It all depends on where you tap the touchpad.The keyboard is comfortable but a little slow. The backlight is very nice.Overall, the computer feels very flimsy. The power button has required multiple pushes to turn on, you have to hit it directly from above and not at an angle to work. While typing this review, I noticed that the weight of my wrists feel like it is going to break the area below the keyboard.  I am sitting on my bed as I type this so my wrists are, by default, on resting on the keyboard.Simply stated, stay about from this machine unless you want to spend upwards of an hour removing bloatware and having a horrible touchpad experience.I will be returning this.", "Date": "August 24, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0080EBKCK"}}
