{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I'm disappointed with Toshiba", "Author": "Gift Recipient \"Mike\"", "ReviewID": "RQQ5II5UCZ1IE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop for school not too long ago.  The specs aren't too terribly impressive, but it gets the job done for the most part.  The build quality is not very good, even for the low price I paid for it.First, after having the laptop for about 6 months, one of the hinges broke and the screen came loose.  Every time I closed it, I had to squeeze the end so the hinges would allign.  I was having to angle the screen closer by about an inch so the loose screen would drop back to where I wanted it.  Fortunately, Toshiba fixed it without any problems.Second, it does not come with a recovery partition.  You have to create a back-up disc from Windows, but you have to use their buggy software to do it. Toshiba's disc burning software is embaressingly slow.  I finally gave-up after 2 1/2 hours and I'm not willing to spend $30 on a recovery disc.  I'm a student, so I was able to get a copy of Windows and do a clean install.Third, the trackpad sucks.  I use the tap-click feature because it's easier for mr.  The problem is that is constantly giving me false taps.  When I'm writing a paper, every four sentences, the trackpad records a false tap and the cursor moves to a random paragraph on my paper.I should have spent a little more and got a Dell or HP.", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love my new lap top and enjoy all the features it has.", "Author": "ananana", "ReviewID": "R1G1OX4MF2IF6T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the finish, which is kinda textured so you don't have to look at the smears of the shining finish ones.

Bought it to Skype with my kids while on vacation and for school. The day before we left it just wouldn't turn on, only had it for a week or two. So I exchanged it at the store and now five months later it has happened again. This time during finals and they want me to send it away to be fixed. Since the same thing has happened to me twice on 2 different devices (at the worst times!) i would say to keep shopping..", "Date": "November 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great at first", "Author": "Reya", "ReviewID": "R21DTX10VI2D12", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop March 2012 for personal/home use. I loved this laptop, especially loved having the numeric keypad on the side. 6 months later it crashed. Unfortunately I did not purchase extra coverage but luckily it was still covered under the 1yr warranty. I was able to send it in to Toshiba for repairs & have it returned to me faster than expected. (the customer service by the way was awesome.) 8 months after that my daughter damaged my screen therefore that had to be replaced. I had someone to replace the damaged screen with one I purchased on amazon. The replacement actually looked better than the original. ok. still good until a month ago when certain keys suddenly stopped working....specifically the z, ?/ key, the zero on the numeric pad & all four arrows. yes you can use the onscreen keyboard but it is extremely annoying trying to type with your mouse.  I've searched for solutions on the internet but none have worked for me. I'm looking at having to either buy a new laptop or possibly pay an arm and a leg to have this repaired.  I would not recommend buying this laptop unless you only plan to use it for a few months and that would be a total waste of money.", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent laptop after upgrades applied", "Author": "Boca Buyer", "ReviewID": "RHC321W2SH1RA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this computer used for $260 dollars.  I installed 8 GB RAM for $50 and a solid state disk drive (SSD) for $125 dollars.  So, for a $435 dollar investment I now have a nice laptop that boots windows in 10 seconds.The B960 isn't an i7 by any means, but I have an Acer i7 with a similar configuration of memory and SSD disk and this Toshiba does what I need it to do just fine.  I have no complaints.  I mostly surf the web which is lightning fast with the SSD and use MS Office.  I also run turbo tax and quicken and they all perform just fine.I'm running Win 7 64 bit, so I can't comment if Win 8 would bring this machine to its knees.This Toshiba was so easy to work on installing the memory and hard drive.  On a B960 Acer where I recently did a similar memory and hard drive upgrade, I had to totally disassember the Acer and dismantle it down past the motherboard.  The Toshiba has trap doors that made the upgrades a breeze.", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not what I expected.", "Author": "Lisa Ferguson", "ReviewID": "R3R0YGCWIJAYX4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Very plain, surface felt like cheap plastic.
