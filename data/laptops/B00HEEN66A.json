{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best Value, Very Satisfied.", "Author": "D \"Darker\"", "ReviewID": "R2H6QOJPOTCLUU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a new laptop after my Lenovo, MacBook Pro, and MacBook Air crashed and/or froze one me multiple times.  I decided to go with Windows because Apple seemed very unreliable for the money I was shelling out.  I found this Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Series at Best Buy, and picked it up after returning 2 other laptops that were defective from HP and Asus.  I also wanted a traditional hard drive because I'm still not convinced that SSD's are reliable, considering my past computers from Dell with traditional hard drives never failed.The Good: The laptop keyboard, which others might complain about, is fast for me because I have smaller hands.  The low profile, low feedback keys allow me to type so much faster than I normally do... maybe 10 wpm higher than my normal typing speed.  I love it.  The Touchscreen is also icing on the cake.  The battery life gets about 6-7 hours with light use.  And even though it's been only a couple of weeks, it has been reliable, which is why I bought it.  The longest lasting laptop for me has been a Dell so far (I had one last about 10 years) so you can say I'm biased for good reason.The Bad: When you first get it, the trackpad will be finicky...  you have to do all the software updates, and make sure to update the Bios, and then upgrade to Windows 8.1, which is free.  After that, it works perfect.  The screen resolution could be better but I can't complain because I purchased this laptop for $900 bucks or so from Best Buy... just make sure you get the full HD version because the other displays are much worse.Conclusion: if you like the keyboard and the savings, in addition to reliability... go with Dell.  If you get one that's not defective at the start, the machine should last you forever.  I know from experience.  I even have my Dell desktop that I purchased about 5 years ago, running strong.  Also, from personal experience, ASUS keyboards are crap, Lenovo has cheap parts that fail and their software has flaws, and Apple Macbooks are no more reliable for the amount you pay.  It's like buying a Mercedes... it still breaks down like any other car but you end up paying a lot more.Happy shopping!!!", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Beautiful, Sleek, and Thin", "Author": "Merari Garcia", "ReviewID": "R26X06ADX3B9OC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like the design, it's very nice laptop, but you should know that it's more of a notebook computer which is why it looks so sleek and thin, because of this, it does not come with a DVD/CD drive. If you want to play DVD's and burn CD's, I recommend a different laptop. I was looking for a computer with a sleek design that's why I bought this one. I really learned to love it! I wasn't too particularly fond of touch screen laptops, but now I can't believe I lived without it, it really comes in handy when you're scrolling.Anyway, there is a minor glitch after the Windows 8.1 update: If you connect your laptop to your TV through via HDMI, the image is great but the audio is not. For some reason the Laptop doesn't detect the display audio input and so the audio only comes through the laptop speakers instead of the TV. This only happened after I updated to Windows 8.1. I found a fix though. Before turning on your laptop, connect the computer to your TV (make sure your TV is on and switched to HDMI) and then turn on your laptop. It detects it right away.Anyway, I recommend this laptop. I really love it.", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing Computer", "Author": "E.C.", "ReviewID": "R3TGPI2Q0Z4K21", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This computer is the best computer I have ever used and owned. The speed is fast enough to keep up with daily tasks and some light gaming, hardcore gaming would not really be appropriate on it. Everything about the computer has surpassed my expectations; Display, speakers, battery life, etc... Right now I am able to open up about 15 tabs in google chrome and run 5-10 apps without a problem. I haven't really pushed it as far as I can yet but this is definitely more than enough for the average user. The battery life is about 5-8 hours depending on how you use it thanks to the low energy processor. It does sacrifice some speed for the ability to use less power but I think its perfect. The display is very crisp and bright but I have heard complaints about it being hard to see in bright sunlight. I could see that being true but I don't normally use my computer outside. There are complaints about the keyboard's feel, I don't notice anything that bothers me. The keys do have slightly less travel than most laptops but it still function perfectly. The glass does get smudged up fairly easily but that is to be expected with a touch screen. I'm thinking about buying a matte screen protector but I really like the quality of the display so I'm hesitant since it might make it slightly blurred. I did not buy my laptop from Amazon or Dell. I actually bought it manufacturer refurbished on Ebay for a fraction of the price. I decided to go this route because I have heard that you have less of a chance of getting a lemon from a manufacturer refurb because of all the testing that is done on it before it can be shipped. This is in contrast to a new computer being built and then shipped with the basic functions checked and no in depth tests being done. I probably saved about $200-400 going this route. I hope this review helped shed some light on the Dell 7000 series and is able to help you choose your next laptop.Dell 7000 series 7537Intel I7-4500u1TB hard driveFull HD display 1920x1080", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very satisfied so far", "Author": "Federico Dur\u00e1n", "ReviewID": "R39L4J5EDKIRLO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My only \"complain\" is about a couple of hangups at first, but there has not been any problem since the laptop applied some updates from Microsoft and Dell.", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice computer but problems with hard drive", "Author": "DK", "ReviewID": "R2SOE36SCDIN8G", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this computer from Dell.  As I was setting it up, I received an error that the hard drive had an issue and would need to be replaced.  Dell provided a new hard drive and had an on-site Tech install it.  However, the very next day (yesterday) the same problem occurred and again Dell is sending a new hard drive and will send a Tech to install it.  Apparently there is a problem where the hard drives they have been installing are not compatible with the system and they need to put in a hard drive from a manufacturer of a compatible drive.While I use a computer constantly, set-up is not my forte.  Each time the hard drive is replaced it is like getting a brand new computer with nothing on it.  Therefore it takes me hours to load the system with software and set it up how I like it.  After already investing numerous hour on this computer, I will again have to start over as Dell will only install the new drive but  will not transfer any programs for customers.I think it will be a good computer once its running properly, but very unhappy with it thus far.", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Series 15.6\" Touch-Screen LCD Laptop with 4th...", "Author": "jwillin", "ReviewID": "RIC4GIZXDKDJZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this on January 16, 2014, and received it on the 21st. I checked it out at Best Buy before purchasing it from Dell. Out of the laptops I looked at this one had the most bang for your bucks. I picked it up from Dell for $100 less.On the surface, this is a nice looking laptop. Of course I have my issues with it and have to agree with other reviewers that Windows 8 is the devil. The only way to get along with it was to let it win and also change my thinking. The best way to get along with Win 8 is to think of it like a tablet. The tiles (apps) remind me of a smartphone or tablet. Once I got there, I was able to work with the new OS. Also, going online and getting it to a point that I could manipulate it, even though that meant making it resemble Win 7, now it's all good.In case you don't know, this laptop does not come with a DVD/CD. You will have to purchase your own. I purchase the Transcend portable DVD Writer. I mention this because if you like having open USB ports (which this laptop has four) this particular unit uses two USB slots for power. I wouldn't purchase it again. It was recognized right off by the OS.Has 3 prong AC cord, no DVD/CD player, has HDMI port, speakers are under the front of the laptop ( I could hear sound, but couldn't figure out where it was coming from since it was muffled)When first logging on, you will need to name your laptop and furnish your personal info which includes first and last name, DOB, gender as a security measure and your email for sending security updates, etc.Will need to create a MS email if you don't want to use your personal, but will still ask for you to create a MS emailWhen updating to 8.1, you may receive an error message that you need to be an administrator in order to upgrade win 8.0. Although the laptop shows you as administrator, because you had to sign on with the MS email address, it doesn't recognize you as the administrator. I had to call tech assistance to find out that I had to create a local user which enabled me to complete the upgrade to win 8.1.You will encounter McAfee Anti-theft software which will be hell to uninstall. It is not virus software, but some type of File Protection software to secure your valuable files. You will have to pay for it because you are not automatically signed up for it. If you don't want it, do a search on how to get rid of it. I wasn't able to go through Control Panel to delete it. It was an awful experience, but doable. Edit: Since Dell does not send an invoice with the laptop upon delivery, you have to go online to see what all has been added to the price. This McAfee software is placed on the bill not sure if it's standard or not, but it doesn't matter since you're paying for it. They do charge you a year's worth of it, but you don't that unless you look at the invoice! I checked to see if the laptop was signed up for the service, but it showed that it wasn't. I had no idea I had paid for the service until after the fact. I don't like McAfee anyway, so I've since removed it. I'm not mad, just disappointed the rep didn't go over what I was being charged more thoroughly.PROs*Aesthetically pleasing to the eye (its purty)*Price is reasonable*Able to get rid of lock screen PW sign on, now goes directly to my desktop (check online for info)*Used ClassicShell for win 7 experience so I would be able to easily access all my programs, files, etc; this is nice because you can still maintain the win 7 look while learning win 8; I like win 8, it's not that bad once you get the hang of it. It just interesting to have a tablet experience on a laptop because of the OS. If you want Start 8 for the win 7 experience it will now costs you $4.99. It is no longer free.*Touchscreen is nice; works great when you don't want or need to use the mouse; but of course using the the touch screen, means fingerprints, etc.!*1 T of storage*Apps are interesting, remind me of my Kindle; MS doesn't have a lot of apps if you are accustomed to the number of apps you can find in Apple or Google PlayStore. There is no software, but apps*Back lit keyboard*Display resolution is beautiful, clear and just great to sit back and enjoy the different themesCONs*Laptop is slow to download software, web pages,  but installing software after download is pretty fast; Most folks state it is because of the 5400 HDD the reason tit is so slow. If that's true, I'm inclined to believe it.*Apps slow to open, not very snappy*Speaker location stinks (under laptop in the front); the sound is okay if you're using it on a tabletop. When I discovered where the speakers were, I was using the laptop while holding it in my lap. I guess I will have to invest in some nice headphones.*Touchpad is not that responsive and not very nice to use. Mouse will freeze at times or get lost on the page. Have to play with the touchpad to find it again. I do recommend getting a cordless mouse for this laptop. It really makes a difference.*Keyboard is mediocre, at times it feels like it's off center, like your hands don't line up properly with it. I hope that makes sense. I would liken it too when you first have to learn how to use an ergonomic keyboard. I make a lot of typing mistakes and also touching the touchpad by accident will frustrate you if you're typing something. It just isn't the same as my Sony Vaio. However, as I get used to the laptop, my opinion my change, who knows. The problem may be the 10 key style numbers on it or just the build of the keyboard, not sure. Keyboard is back lit, but hard to see since it is silver.I still prefer my four year old Sony Vaio, but the Inspiron will do. That's why I gave it a 3 star rating because it isn't a 4 or a 5 nor a 2, but average/acceptable. In other words, it will do for the time being.I wanted a 1T storage, 4th generation Intel chip, touch screen, back lit keyboard at least 8 gig of RAM and something that wouldn't break the bank. That's what I have. I guess I will have to wait until my true dream machine comes along.  :)", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Terrible product/ terrible customer support", "Author": "Mdaisy", "ReviewID": "R13TJT0AYGDMJN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop from Best Buy 1 month ago.
