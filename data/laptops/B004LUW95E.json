I purchased this laptop for work/light-duty everyday use.  The new i3 processor is more then up to the task and I'm almost willing to bet it's probably a little bit faster and better processing power as my Core 2 Quad that I have in my desktop machine.  The chicklet keyboard does take a little to get used to and the the fit and finish for the keyboard garnish could be better where it snaps into the chassis near the top of the computer.  The speakers, for being altec lansing are a little lucklaster, but that may be to the fact that they are upwards firing speakers instead of being on-axis with your ears.  For most average users to surf the web, check emails, etc., this is probably a good computer to go with to replace a bulky desktop unit and it is spec'ed up enough that one can have a longer service life with it without the hardware going obsolete.", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Look Elsewhere", "Author": "Susan RN \"Susan RN\"", "ReviewID": "R3BBOAY0Y9LMR9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'm not sure why I bought this laptop but I wish I never had. After owning this for 3 months, most of the keys stopped working on it. I sent it to Asus for warranty repair and got it back 6 weeks later and the spacebar barely works. Wouldn't you think they'd check it out after they replace the keyboard? It cost me $30 to ship this laptop and I refuse to pay another $30 again. I have to pound on the spacebar to get it to work.

I would never buy it again but I am having issues deciding on what to replace it with because it still runs. The USB ports barely recognize anything. The mouse pad spontaneously forgot how to do multi-touch. And the on keyboard volume control no longer works. Another issue I have encountered is that the memory is split between a C and D drive. This is highly inconvenient being that the computer does not recognize that it still has space to save things (it thinks that it is full when there is another 250GB in the D drive that was there when purchased) My brother has the same laptop and has had the same problems.", "Date": "August 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "My Model - Didn't purchase through AMAZON", "Author": "C.

Sure glad I got the warranty because it has issues. It toggles from plug to unplug all the time without touching the cord. It has been back in for replacement of the plug-in part, which worked about 2 weeks and now it is doing the same thing. This past weekend the power cord overheated and the insulation melted off the cord. I smelled it burning and reached down to unplug it and got a little jolt (shock).", "Date": "February 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not so great as I thought.", "Author": "Ce", "ReviewID": "R19WQS8SN9Q9XC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'm keeping this short and simple.I got my laptop on Monday morning. It blue screened that evening. I did nothing out of the ordinary. I just worked on a project on Excel that was due the following morning.

Bays \"mjb222\"", "ReviewID": "R27RDUP709D7L1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This experience report isn't about this exact model, but a similar one for which I have had a terrible experience with ASUS technical support, and so potential buyers of any ASUS computer should be well-aware in order to know what their experience might be.  The summary is for a simple bad graphics card (under warranty), getting the computer back in working condition involved a 5-week ordeal, 6 emails to them, 5 phone calls, misleading information almost making me pay for repairs, and them wiping my hard drive in my opinion unnecessarily.  All this means I will never buy an ASUS laptop again, and you shouldn't either.  For the details, read on.About 7 months ago, I started noticing a flicker of the laptop's screen about 1 time a day.  I emailed ASUS tech support using their message center about it, and asked what I should do.  Aside from an automated \"we have your message\" email, I got no response back.  Over the next 5 months, it went from 1 flicker a day to 20-30 times a day.  So I finally call ASUS about it, since the warranty was expiring in another ~3 months (at the time of the first flicker it was about a year old, and had a 24 M warranty).So 2 months ago I looked online to find an ASUS tech support phone number to call, since my laptop was still under warranty.  I could not find a single number to call, but a list of authorized repair centers and numbers, so I called the closest one.  They told me I had to call ASUS directly for a RMA number, and gave me the number to call.  So I call ASUS support with the number.  After describing the problem, and being on hold for a while, the representative said that I would have to call back because the tech support network was down.  This made me very upset with ASUS, so when I filled out this same survey over that call, I reviewed your tech support rather negatively.So a few days  later, when it's convienient for me to deal with it again, I call back, and finally get an RMA number, and a few days later mail the package.  About a week after that, I receive a call from ASUS wanting to talk to me about my negative report.  At the time, I was driving on a narrow, windy road, and so told them I could not talk right then, but would love to talk to them, so could they call me back tomorrow?  The operator said sure, and the call ended.  I have yet to receive the call back, over 2 weeks later.About a week after that, I check the status of my RMA, and it says that it's waiting and is on hold for customer authorization, OOW-CID, which from searching i found out meant that the RMA was either out of warranty or customer-induced dam.  I then call ASUS to know what that was about, since I really wanted my laptop back and did not want to wait for ASUS to call me, as well as find out why they thought that the computer was either out of warrenty or the problem was customer-induced.  The response I got back from ASUS was \"don't call us, we'll call you.\"  The tech support person could not look up what the problem was in a database and describe it to me and get a response right then.  1-2 days later, I finally get an email from ASUS indicating that there was damage to the laptop's USB port on the side that looked customer induced, and I would have to pay $65 for labor, an optional $69 to repair the USB port, and another $10+ for pay for shipping back.  When I emailed them to find out exactly what I needed to pay to get just the screen fixed (I'll admit the USB was CID, but it shouldn't have anything to do with the screen), they said I didn't have to pay anything, since what went bad was the graphics card, which was still under warranty and had no CID.  But reading the email again that was not clear at all, and I'm not entirely convinced it wasn't written to mislead me into paying to repair the damaged USB port when that wasn't what I sent the computer in to be repaired.  So they then ship me the computer back the next day.  However, the email I recieved saying they shipped it back indicated it was shipped to *the wrong address.*  I immediately replied to the email, to get an \"undeliverable\" notification.  I looked again at the email, and no where does it say A) that the email was from an undeliverable address, or B) if I had any questions or concerns I should contact _____.  So I contacted the only person I thought I could, the woman that contacted me about verifying I wanted to get the USB port repaired, via email.  I emailed her indicating that they shipped it to the wrong address (apartment number) and gave her the correct address.  I got no response.  So I then did the only thing I thought might work, which was put a note on the door to the apartment they shipped the computer to indicating FedEx should go to my address with the package.  Sure enough, FedEx still had the wrong address, and the only reason I have my computer back is because I put the note on the door.So I finally got my computer back, and notice that as part of fixing my graphics card, they wiped my hard drive.  While I realise I gave them permission to do this on the RMA request form I shipped with my computer, the disclaimer with the permission says \"*Recovering the operating system is required if there is a software related issue.  ASUS is not responsible for any lost data. Please back up all your personal data prior to sending your unit in for RMA service.\"  As they verified, this was not a software issue, but a hardware issue, so I thought that they would only do this if that was necessary, not with what was obviously either a screen or graphics card problem based on the symptom as a diagnostic tool before looking at the screen wiring or the graphics card.  I now have to reinstall all of my programs for school and transfer all my files back over.So yes, ASUS tech support is terrible, the worst from any experience I have and from the stories friends and family have had getting computers returned for service.  I could forgive the defect as \"defects happen,\" and any one of these screw ups as a random kink in the process, but the shear number of ways they screwed up what should have been a streamlined process indicates this is a systemic problem with ASUS tech support.  Don't buy an ASUS unless you're willing to either live with any defects or go through heck trying to get the problem fixed.", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "SPEAKS ARE AWFUL", "Author": "R.
