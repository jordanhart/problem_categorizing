{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Pretty Impressed", "Author": "Jenn", "ReviewID": "R3NYB9UAI846BQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE 10/16/13: I've had this system for a couple months now. It's still running really well, I'm glad to say. I've had no problems at all aside from drivers needing updating, so I stand firm on my 5 stars. Judging from other reviews people have given, there's a risk of getting a bad one, but that's a risk you ALWAYS take when buying computer hardware. The majority of problems people have appear to be software/OS issues (I've seen Internet Explorer pop up the most in these complaints, so people, please, don't use IE for anything other than getting another web browser. It's not worth the headache.) So once again, I highly recommend downgrading to Windows 7, or at the very least, install the updates for Windows, then update all the drivers, and make sure that's the first thing you do when you boot it for the first time. I think that would've solved a lot of problems people were having.I also want to add that my battery life is CRAZY. I can sometimes get 6-7 hours out of it on a full charge. Since there have also been complaints about short battery life on this system, I don't know if I got lucky, or if they (again) just got bad units. Either way, I love this laptop and I'm very happy with it, so I still very much say if you want a good priced system with some power to it, this is it.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I bought this laptop after two days of careful research. I know some people can't be bothered to read through a whole review, so here's a quick pros/cons list:Pros:Lightweight, slim, very portableGreat hardware, especially for the priceCharges quicklyTouch pad actually works wellFour speakers, so the sound is pretty goodConsWINDOWS 8.The keyboard keys take a little bit of getting used toTakes a little force to get usb drives into the ports, but just for the first couple timesVideo chipset uses system RAM if it needs additional video memory, so expanding the RAM comes suggestedI know computers pretty well, being a computer science student approaching graduation, and having built several custom desktops. So far, this laptop seems fantastic for the price. It shipped incredibly fast, (meaning I ordered it at 7 at night and it arrived at 9 the next morning. I'm starting to wonder if Amazon isn't hiring time travelers or something...) and took only a few hours to charge the battery.The first immediate problem with this laptop is Windows 8. I can't emphasize this enough. It's slow, clunky, and fails to properly utilize the hardware. It's TERRIBLE for gaming, or anything requiring heavy use of the hardware. My advice is to downgrade back to 7 as soon as possible.The second problem is the video chip. While it performs well, it also uses system RAM, so an upgrade of the RAM is also recommended. So far, this laptop has played Psychonauts and Oblivion flawlessly on full settings, The Witcher on mid-lower settings, and it'll play Tomb Raider on very low settings. It'll most likely be much better once I clear off the bloatware.Oh yeah, there's bloatware. Not as much as some manufacturers like to put on, but there's enough to gobble of some of the RAM.The feel of it is pretty nice. It's lightweight and easy to carry around, and very thin with the lack of a disk drive. The Steel color is also nicer in person than in the picture. Also, the touchpad is easy to use, and actually works, unlike a lot of other models I've seen. I'd still recommend a mouse, just because I find touchpads a little cumbersome, and this one is a bit big, so you may accidentally click something while trying to type, but it's smooth and functional.So in a nutshell, here's basically what you need to know:It runs well, but is slowed down by the OSIt's light and easy to carryThe speakers are on the bottomThere are 3 USB ports. Two 2.0 ports on either side and one 3.0 on the back.There are two fans on the back panelNo disk drivePerfect for lower-mid range gaming, may have some issues with high end gamingRecommended RAM upgrade, OS downgrade, and mouseI'm pretty happy with this laptop, and I'd gladly recommend it for anyone looking for a good budget system. It's still fairly new, so I'll update if anything significant happens.UPDATE: I just downgraded the OS to Windows 7 and my goodness, the performance went through the roof! It now runs The Witcher on high setting almost perfectly (with anti-aliasing turned off, since that was the biggest performance killer), and runs Skyrim with little to no trouble, though I've yet to mod it, so it runs as well as it did on release. I can now safely say that this is a good gaming laptop. Not the greatest, but I'm impressed.The bad part was that Windows 8 did not want to come off. I had to battle with it almost every step of the way to put 7 on, and it took a lot of patience. Hopefully others will have an easier time with this. My advice would be to plan to spend at least half a day on the downgrade, but believe me, it is completely worth it.It also worth mentioning that even though the speakers on on the bottom, the sound is great.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "minor caveats, great APU, fantastic value", "Author": "Brewineer", "ReviewID": "R26M25ZOBH52SW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Update 9/8:SSD installed and this thing is snappy and responsive (also lighter). This laptop only had space for a 7mm drive, so the 9mm case had to go (a little duct tape kept the SSD board from clattering around).UPDATE 8/31:Added a 4GB stick of RAM from crucial B005LDLV6Sand got a nice bump in performance (653 vs 450 3dmarks in Firestrike test) and will add an SSD soon.Also the speakers are quite good! I lucked out and got this model when it was $420, but it seems to be a great deal still (if you are lucky and do not get a failure unit like the negative reviewers). I've taken this thing apart a couple times and taken it to a couple LAN parties and it keeps working flawlessly.Original Review:I finally got myself a new laptop for light general use and the occasional LAN party as well as older games. Having a pretty fast AMD APU was exactly want I wanted. The A8-5557M is only second to the A10-5757M. I was very surprised to find this fast a chip in such a cheap laptop. It's also amazingly thin and light.However, the potent APU is let down by the single-channel 1333MHz memory (soldered to the motherboard, so you can't replace it with 1600MHz RAM) which is a significant handicap for the integrated graphics.However, it's easily upgraded! Taking back cover off allows access to the single SODIMM slot(unpopulated) as well as the Hard drive, so no need to pull the keyboard out to upgrade bits. I've already ordered a 4GB stick to double the memory as well as the bandwidth, and an SSD to really make it fly.The battery is low capacity, as expected on a budget laptop. The Li-poly packs are not packaged as a unit, so replacing them in the future may be difficult. This is one of many trade-offs for the thin and light build.The fans are somewhat loud and high pitched, as expected on such a thin laptop, but they don't bother me much.I'm not a fan of Windows 8, but that's hardly Acer's fault and I already put 7 on, which runs wonderfully. (FYI, pull the USB 3 drivers off before you format, Acer doesn't have them on the support page, and I thought they would be part of the AMD mobility drivers)I like the chiclet keyboard, nothing fancy but pleasant enough. The touchpad isn't so great. If you press the corner to click (not separate buttons), the whole pad tilts, and sometimes the cursor moves while clicking.The screen is your typical 1366x768 budget laptop screen with a gloss finish, works well enough. Things look a bit greenish and washed out compared to my IPS monitor. Once again, well within the expectations of a budget laptop.Of course, this being a budget model, many of the cons are directly the result of getting what you pay for, and I think you get a lot of value here, especially when you consider the upgrade potential. Similarly, the lack of optical drive and small battery allow this to be such a cheap ultra-thin and light laptop.I believe I will greatly enjoy this laptop!Pros:Thin, Light, cheapAMD A8-5557M APUUpgrade potential (Easy access to SODIMM slot and HDD)chiclet keyboardCons:no optical driveSmall batteryhigh pitched fans (moderately loud)1333Mhz Single Channel memorytouchpad", "Date": "August 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far so good", "Author": "KyleJA", "ReviewID": "R3B0EYWF65S0LX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE(13th Dec' 2013): So I've found the problem that has been plaguing this laptop. It turns out that there was a driver issue, preventing my WiFi from working properly and thus causing the laptop to freeze. All I did was disable the Ethernet driver, and so far about 3 weeks have passed and no problems, no hiccups, no issues what so ever, from what I can observe. Just putting this out there so that anyone who may have been experiencing the same issue, may be able to find a solution here.First off I'd like to say that Amazon was very prompt in delivering this product at my Mailing address in the United States. Secondly I've been using this laptop for the past few hours since I've got it and so far it's operating great. One hiccup though, this the first time I'm on a Windows 8 machine so it's taking some time to get used to. I have not had any problems with the OS so far but I must say that it's hard to use a start screen instead of the usual start button we are all used to for like over a decade. Anyone who wants to buy a new laptop, I advise you to not be afraid of windows 8. I urge you that once you're computer literate, overtime u will get used to it. That's it for my review of this laptop, however over the course of the next few months I'll try to update this review so that customers can be better informed.UPDATE: Still enjoy using this laptop. It performs pretty well and remains fluid when switching from app to app or program to program. Tested out the Graphics card with Deus Ex: Human Revolution. The quality is great it can play the game between medium and high settings. When Anti-Aliasing is on high, the frame rate drops though. The speakers on this laptop are beeeeeeeeeeeast! Best built in laptop speakers I've heard in a while and the dolby home theater just ADDS to the sound quality of the speakers, I love them. Only real problems I can note are just one, the touchpad. This touchpad tends to stick or stop working for short periods of 30 seconds or so. It's annoying, and I think this is attributed to the program which takes care of functions and processing for the touchpad, being bumped off at times in favour of another program. As such it takes the processor some seconds to get back to handling the program. Nevertheless this is not really a consistent problem so it can be forgiven. Overall in my opinion this laptop is a good buy. You get an all round machine that performs excellent for work and play. Just don't expect it to play a game like Crysis 1 on Ultra settings -__-UPDATE 7th October '13Ok I have been using this laptop for roughly 2 months now and it really is good except for one minor hiccup as of recent. WINDOWS 8 BLOWSSSSSSSSSSSSSS! There seems to be issues with regards to Windows 8 and the networking and communication services present in this laptop. Once I'm using the bloody internet browsing the internet, downloading updates or even sending files over the network I created for my laptop and desktop, the laptop would freeze with no warning. Mind you it's not Acer's fault but it is however Microsoft's fault. There has been tons of people complaining about this very same issue that has manifested itself on my laptop and this urks me! Now I am going to have to either wipe my laptop and Re-Install this stupid unstable OS or just downgrade to Windows 7 which is much more stable than Windows 8. My advice for anyone buying this or any other Windows 8 laptop is to go back to Windows 7.....forget that 8 even existed.", "Date": "August 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "For 380 dollar it was worth it.", "Author": "Anonymous", "ReviewID": "RXG940LGRJOTN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is really good for the price that I got it on sale.-It has a quad core A8 5557M in it which shows in benchmark it's comparable to the Intel's i3.-The integrated graphic card is decent but it shares the system memories so you will want another set of ram in this laptop.-I only have minecraft installed on this system so I can mess around while I am at school.

Idle Temp : 89, fully Loaded : 109 (It doesn't even feel like it. I know how it feels since I had a asus N71jq laptop and that was blowing out 98 easily. But on this laptop it feels really cool on the bottom).To me this laptop was worth the money. It is fast enough to do school/homework but it isn't a gaming desktop replacement. There is a youtube video with a person testing out the same model but with a dedicated graphic card. He said there are some drop frames in LoL when a team fight occur and in D3, when mobs start spamming a lot of stuff on to you. These are on low settings btw.When you get this laptop I insist that you will want to get another ram stick to go with it. I bought the G.skill 1333 mhz ddr3 204 DIM Slot (I usually buy their rams even for my desktop). It is easy to get windows 8.1 to boot to desktop instead of starting off on to the Start screen. All you need to do is right click on the taskbar -> properties -> Navigation -> Check \"When I sign in or close all apps on a screen, go to desktop instead of Start\". When you check Show App view automatically when I go to start, it will somewhat look like the all program in the previous Operating System.I talk to Acer about taking the laptop apart and they told me that you don't void the warranty as there is no sticker on the bottom of these laptop. But when shipping it in for repair, you will need to replace the things that you replace as in the ram, ssd/sshd back to the original ones.", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Thin and Powerful", "Author": "TCCC143", "ReviewID": "R1H10WX83O28NS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Probably the thinnest laptop I have ever owned.

Also Windows 8 does not have Word or Excel programs, but I see I can get it online for a minimum monthly charge through Microsoft.

When I received it and took it for a spin, it sucked so hard I returned it the very next day. It's a good looking machine, but it ran awkwardly and clunky for me. The main thing wrong with it is it has the worst touchpad I've ever used. It's key with Windows 8, apparently, to have a decent touchpad- because with this one you will be jumping from window to window inadvertently. Forget about trying to explore the World Wide Web with this touchpad, the two-finger scroll will see to it that every time you scroll up and down a page you will accidentally highlight text, without fail. Adjusting the pad settings to turn off the \"tapping\" option did not seem to fix this somehow.Overall, look elsewhere for a decent laptop as I did.
