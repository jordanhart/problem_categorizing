{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Love this laptop!", "Author": "HollyW0607", "ReviewID": "R2KTTY2SCDLXEQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I retired from my full time job, I wanted to get an up to date laptop for home for my part time job of teaching at our community college. My desktop is 8 years old and slow! I researched for several months, checked the local stores, and wound up ordering this Toshiba through Amazon Sellers. I'm using it right now to type this review. It's a great laptop for the price. It doesn't have a touch screen but I didn't want that. It does have the RAM that I wanted, the mid-range Intel processor, and the hard drive that I wanted. I love that it has a numeric keyboard - my laptop at my full time job didn't have that - and it still has the DVD-R so I can watch movies, etc. It's got a big enough screen and is very light weight, something I really needed since it will be traveling with me quite a bit as I visit my new grandsons this fall, both of whom will be over 1000 miles away. It has a cool design to it, very sleek and modern looking, not that I cared about that but it's a nice bonus. Two things that aren't great - I'm still getting used to the keyboard. The keys seem to require that you hit them dead on. Haven't found a way to adjust the touch, if there is a way (and I admit, I only read the quick start up instructions). The other thing is; I HATE WINDOWS 8!!! Nothing to do with the laptop but it came with 8.1 and I did that intentionally since the college where I teach is going to that in all the in-class computers. The good news is that I have managed to get the laptop to mostly boot up in more of a Win7 look but I still have trouble finding things on the laptop that were so easy with XP and not much worse with Win7 (I didn't like Vista, either, but even that was better than Win8). Bottom line, this is a great laptop for someone who does a lot of classroom type stuff, videos, etc. Boots up fast and has lots of speed for videos and Web searches. Plenty of USB ports, too. I don't know how it would be for gaming since I don't play anything other than Solitaire on the computer (I much prefer XBox or Wii for gaming). It's lightweight and loaded with features at a reasonable price. It came in just a few days, well packed for shipping, and took me no time at all to set up. Would probably be great for business people, definitely great for educators.", "Date": "May 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Thrilled!", "Author": "Karen HElms", "ReviewID": "R3B87XY0NM5CBP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It was purchased for a friend snd he loves it!

The trackpad seems to be too sensitive and scrolling through a page leads to accidentally clicking some link and also selecting text on the page. The keys on the key board need to be pressed properly from the center else the key press does not take effect. Performance-wise seems to be ok so far.", "Date": "May 17, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$899.99", "Features": "8GB RAM\n750GB Hard drive\nDVDRW\nHDMI output\nIntel\u00ae CoreTM i5-4200U Processor 1.8GHz (4th Generation)", "Name": "Toshiba Satellite L55-A5184 Intel\u00ae CoreTM i5 processor and 8GB of RAM 750GB Hard drive DVDRW WIFI HDMI WEBCAM", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RBXNQwAcL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00IO5QO0I"}}
