Didn't have the chance to see every feature, but I can say that I loved this PC at first sight.. Looks so solid, not like some others giving you a feeling that they will break down if you don't be very careful. Only problem for now seems to be the touch pad. I can say that its little bit sticky, hard to move the cursor precisely.. Also, left and right click buttons are really hard to press. Clicking means really clicking for this laptop !!! Don't hesitate to buy, perfect item for its price. But make sure you order a nice mice too..Now, after using the PC for a few days, I m happy to see that the touch pad buttons are getting easier to press. Finger print reader and Hp Simple Pass application that allows you to use your fingerprint instead of entering usernames and passwords works very well. Swipe your finger once and all the websites you enrolled in fingerprint system shows up. Swipe it once more, you are logged on in seconds.

I removed many including Norton. Try AVG free for anti-virus, search google you will find it.Also, some want just the Windows 7 OS! This is easily done by pressing the F11 key during boot up. You will then go into the Recovery console and choose the one on the left that says \"Minimal Install\". After you reboot the only thing on the laptop will be the Windows 7 premium (64bit) OS and I checked in device manager and everything is working!As noted above the F11 key that kicks off the HP recovery console is a very nice feature but another is the one built into Windows 7 called \"Backup\" (type in Backup in the search when in Windows). Choose to create a \"System Image\" and have a portable USB/eSata hdd ready. You can then save the image to that drive in case of disaster. At the end of the System Image creation make sure you create the System Repair CD. The System Repair CD will be used to restore the \"System Image\" if you ever need to. This is very usefull after you get the laptop loaded and customized with all the software that you want.The touch pad, don't be so quick to judge. Look in the control panel for the touchpad control and try a few different options.

I purchased a HP Pavilion laptop with a Windows 7 Professional operating system in March 2010. The hard drive crashed while the system was under warranty in September 2010.  I discovered the external Seagate backup drive performed a selective backup instead of a complete backup, backing up only 18 GB out of 200 GB of data. According to one computer repair technician, many of the files were still readable on the defective HP drive. I then decided to replace the hard drive myself at my cost and reload the OS, only to learn that HP \"tatoos\" their drives preventing anyone from replacing the drive with anything other than the exact same drive from HP. Without the tatoo, I could not reload my operating system which came from HP. HP quoted me a price over $300 for the HP replacement \"tatooed? hard drive.  Identical drives without the tatoo cost approximately 1/3 the price of the HP drive. As I had already purchased a hard drive from a local \"big chain\" computer repair shop, I decided to obtain a new copy of Windows 7 Professional and just reload the operating system. Again, I learned that this also does not work. HP informed me that they would give me a replacement hard drive only after I gave them my original hard drive.  Since I first needed a computer with the Windows 7 operating system installed to transfer the recoverable data files from the bad drive to a good drive and then to securely erase data on the the old drive, this was not an acceptable option. HP tech support failed miserably during this process since the HP technician (who had a heavy India English accent) told me that I had to go back to the computer store where I purchased the hard drive and have them fix the system. It took four weeks for me to discover that ONLY HP could fix the laptop. I did take the laptop back to the place of purchase.  They experienced the same problem in attempting to get HP to fix the laptop. The computer has been broken now for seven weeks. While the HP laptop operated okay (not great, just OK) when it worked, I discovered that HP laptops are simply no longer repairable unless you bite the bullet and allow HP to make the repairs at an incredibly high price. In reviewing prior laptop purchases, I realized that ALL of my prior HP laptops had broken after a year or so and that the other brands of laptops I purchased - while old and banged up from use - continued to operate. It does not make sense: why would a company (HP) which brags that it is a \"green\" company produce disposable laptops whose users will throw them away into the dumpster when they break and when they learn they are not economical to upgrade or repair.", "Date": "October 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "HP Pavilion dv6 series laptop", "Author": "p. fossier \"pfossier\"", "ReviewID": "RU7C2LPQGTLUL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "You be the judge:Bought an HP Pavilion dv6 series notebook new from Best Buy on 11/01/09.Repair history:HD died and was replaced on 03/22/10.HD died and was replaced on 05/24/10.Integrated mouse broke 08/22/10HD died 11/12/10 - parts and laptop are out of warrantyReplacement parts have a 90 days warranty.Tech support in India is not allowed to connect me to a manageror refer me back to a customer support department in the US.They do want me to sign up for extended care for another $200/yearbut even if it were free - who would want to go through this type ofordeal.

It looks very cool and it is very thin. I so want to keep it but the track pad is driving me crazy. It is very hard to use and it's already causing me finger pain on my second day. The cursor jumps around as I am typing on the keyboard, but when I do need to use the track pad to scroll up and down, it is half dead. Very very frustrating to use. Another thing I hate about this laptop is the monitor. The colors appear strangely purplish and it is nearly impossible to see details if the colors are light. For example, it is impossible to see a lace pattern on the screen. I went through color calibration but it didn't help.

This is a great friendly laptop that will definitely meet all your requirements. I would give this more stars if possible. The keyboard is amazing, the battery life is amazing, and the overall performance of the windows system formatted on here is perfect.The only thing I do not like about this laptop is the sensitivity of the mouse touch pad. It is hardly sensitive and with other laptops you can scroll down the page with one finger and here you have to use two.

I've gotten plenty of use out of this machine in that time and these are my thoughts.The first thing you must do to get the optimal experience from this device is to remove every bit of HP bloatware installed on the machine.  This is VERY important.  Most if not all of it can be removed as each HP bundled application is a fancy interface for something windows already provides, such as an application to interface with your wireless adapter.  I got rid of everything except the support interface that automagically checks for new drivers.  If this is not done, you cannot make a reliable comparison between this machine and a similarly specc'd machine from a different company.  Removing the hp bloatware will also help to increase your battery life as well.With that said, after removing hp's stuffs, this machine performs like a champ.  I can run virtual machines while doing development work and compiles happen quickly.  I haven't had the greatest experience getting all hardware to work with linux-based distributions, so I've pretty much stuck with Windows 7 as my primary OS.  Touchpad drivers in linux (synaptics) are spotty with support at best.For those making comments about the machine getting hot, here's the reason.  The fan intake is on the bottom of the machine.  If I block the fan input by putting the machine on a soft surface, it can get hot.  This is my number one complaint with this machine is the placement of the fan intake.  If it is placed on a hard surface, I see no such issues with heat.  Don't lay this device on a pillow and expect it NOT to get hot though, that would be unrealistic.I don't do any PC gaming (console gaming mostly), so the less-than-stellar graphics hardware was not and is still not a concern for me.  The graphics hardware as-is will play HD video very well, which is the only requirement I actually have.All in all, this was the perfect device for my needs and I got it on sale at $550!  This is definitely a superb budget development machine with lots of ports for different components.  If you want to properly care for this device, you have to be mindful of the fan intake and ensure proper ventilation.  My teenage sister has killed 2 machines (from different manufacturers) by not allowing proper ventilation.Other random cons:No keyboard backlighting2 hour-ish battery lifeI hope this review will help others make an informed decision.", "Date": "April 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Solid laptop...but!!!!", "Author": "Chris O \"Contrarian\"", "ReviewID": "RCB8UDZP4T9SO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a pretty solid laptop and I can't add much more to what any of the others who have reviewed this before me have said.Really, I have only one minor negative and one really major negative which is just now cropping up.The minor:  I hate, hate, HATE the power cable/input.  It's a giant and stiff thing jutting out from the side of the computer.  I know from experience that I'll end up beating it up until the power jack inside the laptop ends up breaking.  I've done it with several other laptops in my life, and this one will be worse than most.  At least it's not on the rear of the computer.  Those go quickly.  Yes, I'm rough on my equipment but I really wish manufacturers would give this issue a little more thought.  If you're really careful with it, you won't have any problem other than two inches worth of power plug sitting there on the side of your laptop.The major:  You should be aware that if you're buying this for the fingerprint reader, it's not going to work for you if you've upgraded your browsers (Firefox 4, IE9), and it doesn't work at all in Chrome.  To add insult to injury, the manufacturer (Digital Personas) has ceased support for this scanner to concentrate more corporate things and less on the consumer market.  The scanner was a deciding factor in my purchase of this laptop over some other models, so I'm pretty irritated.  There may be some third party support in the form of plugins or whatnot later, but that doesn't make me any happier.  The scanner still works and still manages passwords, but it will not auto-fill website logins when using these newer browsers and this was its primary reason for existing.  You can still use it to unlock your computer and do some other minor things, but if you're going to use it to make your web experience better, forget about it.Other than that, this is a solid, if unspectacular, laptop.  At the price Amazon is charging for this now (I got this for two hundred dollars cheaper from Amazon 6 months ago...wth?), there are probably better options.
