Full keyboard, beautiful display. Light, sleek.Con: None so farOther Thoughts: The A4 processor isn't known for its amazing speed, but this laptop really seems to kick it up a notch.  I was very impressed with the snappy-ness of this laptop.  It's also able to stream netflix and hulu through the HDMI port at full 1080p HD without any problems and browse facebook with no problems at all.Overall: Great Value!!!", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "toshiba laptop", "Author": "brian", "ReviewID": "R1DVVZMMTDLAM1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "this computer has a beautiful clear picture.

I mainly use this as a means by which I can watch streaming video on my television - I watch movies and shows on Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Instant Video and could not find any other solution that would give me HD quality of all three services in one device. With the HDMI port, this is the perfect solution.As for the laptop itself, it is a better-than-basic level machine. I may add more memory if that becomes any kind of an issue, but it is more than adequate for basic computing, multimedia, web browsing and portable use. Great bang for the buck!", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Arrived with a non-functional battery", "Author": "Rick Conway", "ReviewID": "R2NK7PH5YLRFBV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The laptop got here quick, but it arrived with a dead, non working battery.
