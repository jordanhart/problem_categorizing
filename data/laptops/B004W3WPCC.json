Tech has come a loooong way... :D", "Author": "Anthony Gomulka \"Tony\"", "ReviewID": "R3AG85U5IK6FW8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop directly from HP with slightly different specs. I only got 1gb of ram for the GPU, the steel case, and a 1080p screen. My 750gig hard drive is a 7200rpm. I wonder what the one in this laptop is because they don't feel like specifying... :PBloatware wasn't that bad, the speed of this laptop made going through that process reaaally fast. I'm a DJ/Producer and this laptop handles Traktor and Ableton without a hitch. Its just amazing. :DI work at a computer repair shop and I find it ironic that I bought a dv6 even after I've seen 30+ dv6000s from 3-4 years ago with bad motherboards. :D I just hope that trend doesn't carry over with complete redesigns... :DThis is a relevantly new laptop, so no one can speak on longevity, but with tech progressing like it is, life expectancy should only go up. :) If your looking for a high end PC for a little over a grand, this is a great place to start.Amazon might decide to edit my comment for me saying this, but consider buy directly from HP, you WILL wait at least 2 weeks for your laptop to arrive, but for me its worth it. :D You get exactly what you want. For me I really wanted the 1080p screen. :P", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great purchase", "Author": "Eduk79", "ReviewID": "RNYD3HL84BZX0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This computer has an excellent overall performance. I owned a HP Pavilion DV5 before this one with a Core 2 Duo and there is a big difference between them. The 15,6\" display is great too and the aluminium case is well finished (although a little bit cold in winter and finger prints get easily marked on it). Memory size and HD are also significant pros in this laptop. I have only two minor issues: the battery charger is quite large, even bigger than the one my previous HP had, thus it's not very nice for travelling. The second issue is a simple but quite annoying thing: the num lock key has no \"on\" indicator (very strange considering the caps lock key does).Above that, the laptop provides an excellent user experience, with a much better boot up speed and delivering a noticeable processing power.I must point out that this laptop didn't came with Bluray player. There must be some mistake in the description.", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop for the Poweruser", "Author": "Kevin", "ReviewID": "R6913T2IP4KIY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this laptop recently and I love it. Definitely a slick deal if you can ever get it for under 1000 dollars and the same specs. I'll make a list to keep it short and sweet.Pros:-Switchable Graphics are awesome. Just use Catalyst Control Center to switch between high powered gaming graphics and battery saving integrated graphics.-Super powerful! the i7 quad core is fast. Really fast. Especially for me, who upgraded from a single cored desktop.-Design is great. Everything looks really sleek. Aluminum finish is nice, but can get fingerprinty.-Keyboard is awesome. I can type really fast on it. Chicklet, comparable to Macbook's. The numpad/tenkey can be annoying for some, but I like being able to type:'-Fingerprint reader is actually pretty useful. I thought it was just a gimmick, but it works really well.-Amazing battery life if you can get the 9cell battery. I've gotten around 5-7 hours with light internet browsing. Maybe 3 hours with heavy [sc2] gaming.-Runs games well.-2 USB 3.0 slots.-A lot of other hp goodies, like coolsense and that one harddrive protection thing.Cons:-Keyboard is not backlit-touchpad's multitouch gestures (2 finger scroll and pinch to zoom) are kind of faulty-Screen resolution could be better, but for the gamers, remember that lower resolution will help games run better.Would definitely buy for any:GamerCollege StudentWindows enthusiastAnyone in need of a powerful windows computer.", "Date": "June 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great features but broken graphics", "Author": "Christopher J. Ashton", "ReviewID": "R1QSE541VH1VFY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this configuration (except with 1GB graphics) but this holds for both 1GB and 2GB cards:AMD/HP have enabled dynamic switchable graphics in this laptop.  This means you can on-the-fly choose which applications you would like to be high performance or low performance... but it doesn't guarantee which card the application will run on.  The driver does this, taking your suggestion into account.  Unfortunately, by design the driver never switches OpenGL graphics to the dedicated graphics card.  This means if you use any OpenGL applications regularly you will only use the integrated Intel graphics card, which is better than previous generations but by no means powerful.  Classic example: this is a laptop that can't run Minecraft, one of the most basic games.  It also won't accelerate any content applications like Photoshop, etc. that have optional OpenGL acceleration.If you don't use OpenGL ever, this is an amazing laptop.  Unfortunately it's advertised as fully supporting OpenGL, which in my mind makes this a product broken by design hence the score.EDIT: I'd like re-iterate out that this laptop isn't defective, by design OpenGL doesn't work.  HP is unable/unwilling to fix the problem and AMD has been completely silent about it.", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Distracting Fan Noise", "Author": "Gregory Miller", "ReviewID": "R2G2EG371J05O6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I sent this machine back for a refund.

The main problem, other that its an underwhelming product in total, is design oriented. The laptop has an aluminum band around the edge.

But, it's been feeling slow and it really can't keep up with some of the new software as well as having USB 1.0 ports that are painfully slow compared to USB 2.0.  So I wanted to get a new machine.  My main requirement was that the screen needed be be a high resolution one.  That limits choices.  I found a great deal on the HP.  So I took the plunge.The HP arrived on schedule and I started to use it right away.  Man this machine felt fast.  The screen was great.  The speed was great.  Sound was good.  No matter what they want you to believe, there is no way tiny laptop speakers will sound anything better than good.  They will not replace anyone's dedicated home stereo, unless it is really, really bad.  I was really happy with the computer at first.I was a happy camper until I started doing some typing.  I noticed that when I did a remote desktop connection to another computer the cursor would unexpectedly jump around.  This was annoying.  I thought that maybe I had a wireless router issue and tried reconnecting.  The problem kept recurring.  Then I noticed that the problem also occurred when I was using other software.  I then paid a closer attention and figured out the problem.  The touch pad on the computer is not centered with the keyboard.  It is offset to the right about 1/4\".  I have no idea why they did that.  But that 1/4\" offset means that when I type my right hand kept hitting the touch pad and making the cursor jump.  I don't have large hands, so I'm sure others would have the same problem.  I can't believe they would release a product with such a major problem.So less than three weeks after I got it and spent many hours setting it up and loading software I had to return the laptop.  When I called to get an RMA I was offered a discount, they didn't say how much, but I declined it without a second thought.Since then I have gone to a few stores to test out various laptops and I have no issues with other non-HP laptops.  Right now I am probably going to end up with a Dell, Sony or possibly an ASUS.It's really too bad as with the exception of the mis-placed touch pad I really liked the computer.", "Date": "June 30,
