The i5 processor is a big plus and a noticeable difference from my last PC. The computing experience is elevated using this machine. The aluminum finish gives this a nice clean cut look. The battery life is 3.5 hrs which is excellent considering the power of the machine. The beats audio sound system is a pleasant touch when viewing multimedia. Also for those who are tired with all the \"log-ins\" online the fingerprint reader is a great bonus that can automatically sign you in with one swipe of the finger. With all the features, this laptop can go toe to toe with any other 17\" laptop on the market and is drastically cheaper.", "Date": "February 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop for the price", "Author": "Mandy", "ReviewID": "RHBR6GD057AXR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this laptop and after haveing an Acer for so long this laptop really makes you relize what quality and performance HP gives in thier PC's.It has a fingerprint reader which is so nifty cause I just scan my finger to log on to any website or enter my computer super security.This laptop is wi-max ready which is helpfull for anyone who needs long distance internet.The Silver titianium shell is durable and pretty.This is the nicest laptop anyone can get for the price;Also consumer report's gives HP laptops Dv7 modle notebooks 74 out of 100.", "Date": "January 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Comp", "Author": "Tiff Taff TX", "ReviewID": "R32LYM0ZOTJ5RZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this computer for 4 months now and I love it. For one thing, I love the exterior design. Be forewarned however, if you have you laptop in your room like I do and you don't turn in off every night, the HP symbol on the back glows... VERY bright, I have to set something on top of it to block out the light so I can sleep (I haven't checked, but there might be a setting to turn it off).When you lift the lid of the laptop, you have a very neat and tidy layout. The screen is huge, so there is enough room on the keyboard to have a numlocks pad. I also like the mouse pad. You can use two fingers to scroll and you can also zoom in and out on any screen (I just tested this on the desktop too, and it changes the size of your desktop icons when you do that). On my older laptop, the finger pad, left and right buttons were all separate, but on this HP it is all on one pad, so that took some getting used to for me.I also like having the finger scanner. I use it to log on to the computer quickly - no more typing in user passwords. You can also use it to log on to other websites, such as skype, wellsfargo, hotmail, gmail, facebook, etc. HOWEVER!!!!!: DON'T EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO USE THIS FEATURE IF YOU ARE A GOOGLE CHROME USER!!! I hear it works on internet explorer and firefox, but as of YET, it is not compatible with google chrome. Personally, I can live without the finger scanner to log in to various sites until chrome gets this worked out - I have no intention of switching to another browser.The Webcam is FANTASTIC! I love it. Very high quality. It even has some fun features that come with it; faces, hats, drawing. It's cute. The microphone is also amazing. It will even pick up a very quiet whisper.The graphics are beautiful, and the colors are very vivid. I am not a huge computer gamer, I just play Halo and Guild Wars and a lot of minigames on bored.com, but everything looks great while I play.The speakers are good. I think the associate at Best Buy was right when he said that in order to use the Beats Audio to its full potential, you would have to  get some external speakers or listen through headphones. But when I'm walking around the house, the speakers are good enough on their own.USB plugs are on the side, not on the back. I like it when they are on the backside of the computer, because whatever you are plugging into the computer would be out of the way, but that's not possible with this computer because of the battery. It also only has 3 USB plugs.The computer itself is also quite quiet. As I sit here now, even with multiple programs running and without the computer even being plugged in, it is very quiet - just the faintest whisper of a fan.And the battery life is long. Probably about 7 hours. I usually leave it unplugged on the kitchen table and it will last for about a week without it needing to be plugged in - so long as I use the battery saving preference and close the lid when I'm done with it.Before I decided to get this computer, I read the good and bad reviews from multiple sites. From my experience, it seems that people who wrote the bad reviews probably had a defective machine which is a risk with anything you buy, whether you're buying a laptop or xbox or a washing machine.All in all, I love my computer. And this computer has turned me into a HP FanGirl. After this computer I got a HP External Harddrive, mouse, and my bf and I just bought a new HP Printer yesterday.", "Date": "September 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great laptop", "Author": "HankT", "ReviewID": "R1JXZG00N5W2I5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Overall this is a great PC.

I especially liked the Beats audio.But with time and the usage the shoddy built started to show its true face. Mind you, I used my laptop primarily as a desktop replacement which means it was not moved around much, it stayed on my desk 90% of the time.The battery died before the warranty expired, HP refused to replace it because laptop was bought in Canada and I live in Europe.The metal top case is coming apart, the metal screen encasing is slowly ungluing as well.The keyboard was faulty from the beginning, the space bar (I think this is probably the one of the most used and crucial keys) did not respond well - had to hit it hard a couple of times to take effect - the rest of the keys feel like they were all slid slightly to the left and are not responsive enough. Actually, I never really liked using the keyboard and would attach another one for daily and heavy use.This laptop with its shiny looks (especially in pictures) and a long and impressive specs sheet sounds like a good choice but after a year long usage it falls quite short. HP tends to use low quality components across the board which starts to show over time.Because of all this and their horrible customer service I will never even look at another HP product.P.S.

The specs looked great, and I even returned my unopened mid-range HP Laptop to get this unit. A mistake probably!  The unit has no ability to maintain aspect ratio!  That means when you play a game or run an older software app you will have to view it in a small box, or have the app/game distorted/stretched over the widescreen!  My 5 year old HP laptop doesn't suffer from this!  When you find the settings for \"preserve aspect ratio\" they \"don't take.\"  The unit refuses to keep the setting. 2 hours on the phone to HP, two different techs - they're baffled!  No answer.  Add to that the horrible distortion of sound through the laptop speakers (it's bearable through headphones but still not great) and this is simple junk!  Bejeweled 3 and Bejeweled Blitz are completely distorted.  Adjusting various sound settings (tone in Windows, even killing the EQ in beat audio's settings) either muffled or distorted the speaker sound. Unbelievable.  Fixes on the internet for the aspect ratio either don't work, or involve tedious settings-fumbling in 3D elements in ATI control panel, and only for 1 game at a time. There is no solution for the sound horror. All drivers updated.
