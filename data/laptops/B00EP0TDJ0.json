Fast enough for normal uses, well laid out, good resolution screen.  It is a 'touch screen', but a 'soft' LCD screen, NOT the glass screen type.  With keyboard, mouse and touch screen,  it is pretty flexible efficiency-wise.Good size 500 Gig hard drive, and the 4 Gig of ram is adequate.  Expandable to 16Gig, and the PDF Manual even shows you how to add memory.Toshiba keyboard functions are well thought-out.  Nice.This laptop is worth a look.

Flimsy, cheap, unreliable, and built with the cheapest components available. Save your money and spend a bit more on something else not built by Toshiba. Best case scenario, you might get 6-12 months out of your laptop before things start to fail. Worse case scenario (as I've just experienced), your laptop will last a matter of weeks before the lights go out. And unfortunately for the buyer, Toshiba often refuses to meet their own warranty obligations. Considering how cheap the laptops are, they don't want to help you, or fix the laptop. They would lose money otherwise. So if you send it in for repairs, like they'll inevitably recommend, you'll find yourself being asked to pay elaborate sums of money because the 'scope of work' is not within the boundaries of the original warranty agreement. This of course is not true. Toshiba is simply trying to force the added costs of warranty repairs down the throats of uninformed customers. Their laptops are cheap, but they won't actually save you any money in the long run.Save your money. Don't buy Toshiba. Consider any laptops made by Toshiba as being purely disposable, or built for third word countries with no consumer protection laws.", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "I Love this Laptop", "Author": "chris and sherry", "ReviewID": "R2FJPBK1UD5MK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought mine in December 2013. I also bought a 3 year warranty to top the toshiba manufacture warranty that came with it, so I am covered for 4 years. I have not had a problem with this laptop. It works perfect at all times. I did buy a toshiba 2 TB external drive for back-ups. I had some problems getting used to Windows 8.1, I called toshiba, he spent over an hour walking me through everything, and gave me time to take notes, (I am used to windows 7). After almost 6 months, still no issues with the touchscreen or anything. I use this for online college, selling online, I have ADD and usually have 8 to 10 tabs opened at once, and unless I have internet issues from my phone company, I never have a problem. My teenage daughters go on their sites with this, and it comes with a free windows security scan. I loved the support that I got from toshiba, and this laptop. I carry it all over, and it does get bangged up through my laptop bag (This is why I have a long warranty plan). I take pictures of everything, up to 300 pictures a week, they look so amazing and more detailed on this laptop. I have gotten addicted to the touch screen to manage my pictures as well, it makes the task so much quicker!! Another bonus, I can copy DVD's without any other programs, Windows 8.1 is set up to do it easier. Overall, it took me a few weeks to get used to windows 8.1 and I kept going back to my HP with fingerprint reader, but, now I only use this, and love it. It takes some time to adjust when upgrading, do not judge it until you have used it for at least 1 month. It starts up quickly every time and is connected to your FREE microsoft account for start up. Also, you can choose to keep a credit card on file through your microsoft account and buy apps that are not free, or there is an app to go straight to the toshiba store already programmed for you. Not only can you get updates from Microsoft for free, but Toshiba as well. The only thing I do not like is, I miss my fingerprint reader and have to remember my password (bad memory). This is a great buy and worth the money. If you have the option to get insurance, do so, touchscreens do break down more often.", "Date": "May 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great laptop", "Author": "Mayco", "ReviewID": "RL4Q9DVES9KYY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only had this laptop for a few weeks but so far it's been great.

It is a brand new unit and the battery does not fully charge.  It is only charging to 77%.  I did a troubleshooting and followed all the suggestions on fixing this and nothing fixed this.  I called Toshiba directly and they are sending me a battery for \"free\" with a $140.00 hold on my debit card for 30 days to ensure that I send the defective battery back to them.  I am not happy with this, but the only reason I am trying a new battery is because Amazon is so good on their word and customer service if I need to send this back.  So, the verdict for me on this laptop is still out.  IF, the battery fixes this problem, I will probably change my rating and revise my review.  However, if the battery problem continues after this, I will be returning the laptop to Amazon.  I have to give big kudos to Amazon for customer service.  I had 2 Amazon packages stolen from the building I live in, and Amazon gave me every penny back via an Amazon gift card within 24 hours.  I will continue being an Amazon customer because of this.  As of right now, I am barely satisfied with Toshiba customer service and hoping this improves if I keep this product.", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Refurbished machines sent as NEW", "Author": "RPlanet \"Rich\"", "ReviewID": "R1UJJSF3J9UTL2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We received at least one machine that seems refurbished rather than new and it was also DOA (keyboard didn't work).", "Date": "March 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "stupid design squared", "Author": "Nick Halbrook", "ReviewID": "R3BK2M7NZGMZO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Firstly, bought this from Best Buy as they had it for ca$40 less than Amazon. In this get it now world in which Amazon performance is iconic Best Buy took nearly a week to get this to me and I am in a major metro area. Big box vs no box as they never processed this Saturday order until Monday and did not ship until Tuesday. Oddly, this price only available from them on line making my trip to their store pointless. Screwed up bidniz model IMVVHO.Touch screen design is absurd. Must gingerly reach across expansive keyboard to get to screen and in doing so you had durst not touch the keyboard! Max angle of screen tilt is only ca135 degrees making it difficult to view and use keyboard at same time up close if you hold it while in a recliner. Screen is very very touch sensitive. Huge keyboard which is nice. An odd nearly 2:1 aspect ratio on screen which reduces its at first gloss largeness utility as headers and footers eat up too much vertical space. A myopic gamer benefit? Puter has a zillion bloatware items - must have hired the same people for doing this as Verizon! Edges of open case are hard and sharp w/virtually no radius so not comfy to rest hand upon. All in all a rather paradoxical do not touch me design! Screen has a very small view angle before things become obscured by color change even on high contrast.As far as Win 8.1 goes, so far so good. Seems just like another of their new OSs with change for the sake of change and fixes for things not broken - a MS if not  a big bidniz penchant. Desktop icon text shadow cannot be turned off as the selector box to turn it off does not work so only way to get non-fuzzy view of text is to use a black desktop. Apparently there has been a devolution in the intellectual capital that used to exist in there being an amazingly effective auto select genetic like ability for the OS to choose color contrasts between text and background as well as between adjacent backgrounds. Color wheel stupidity now seems to rule. Hmmm - did accidentally find a way to effectively deal with the text shadow and have my yellow desktop but damned if I can figure it out again. Something to do with larger font / bold font as I recall.This monster is beyond heavy! Definitely a home machine only unless you are a Charles Atlas. Battery life ... what battery life ??? Again a home only machine. Trial only versions of office and security suite software. Put Avast on last week.

I've had so many problems with this computer I can't even begin to discuss them all. The main issue right now is that the touch screen doesn't respond to touch anymore, which makes Windows 8 the biggest nightmare in the world to navigate. The sound controls sometimes work, sometimes they don't. Sometimes the touch pad works, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes the size of the screen expands to 200% and won't go back until I restart the computer. I've had to wipe clean the computer twice to get it to function correctly, as correct as possible without a touch screen that is. Screws unscrew themselves on the bottom of the laptop and fall out occasionally. Please save yourself a headache and spend an extra $100-200 dollars on a better quality, non-Toshiba product.
