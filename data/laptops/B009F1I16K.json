This model is a huge upgrade, super affordable, and linux is definitely the way to go.  BUT I have now purchased two devices (same model) and both are defective.  The first one had a hard drive failure.  I'm a computer person so this can happen.  I contacted Asus and sent it in for a RMD request to get repaired.  In the meantime I ordered a second computer because I liked it so much.  The second one had malfunctioning sleep settings which results in the battery dying whether you use it or not.  So it's impossible to leave the computer \"where you're at\" without plugging it in which feels a lot more like a desktop.  Also the speakers hiss at me, intermittently so it's just awful and the sound has to be muted.  In the meantime I got the first computer back and it was returned in the exact same condition so now I have a second RMD request.  Disappointing ASUS - I will be returning the second machine purchased and hoping that the second RMD process is successful.As a side note, you can only email or \"online chat\" with the support team.  Sometimes you just need to talk to someone.  The online chat system would be a fantastic idea if it wasn't executed so terribly with huge delays, incredibly generic responses, and no personal touch.Three stars because I still love the computer - if it worked!  And I know like 10 percent of electronics fail in the first thirty days so it's not so unusual BUT I can't believe they returned me the same broken computer and that I ended up with two defectives out of the 10 percent.*****Update - Asus returned computer a SECOND TIME not booting.  Customer service so terrible this will be my LAST Asus.  Returned second laptop and am going to see if first one can still be returned.  Unbelievable that they would return a broken computer....TWICE!  Dropped to two stars and that feels generous somehow....maybe it's because I like Adorama Cameras, not their fault.UPDATE 01/08/14 - So I finally figured out what Asus was doing.  They replace the hard drive but failed to reload the operating system - TWICE.  As such I certainly wasn't sending it back a third time.  I had a copy of Windows so I've put that on (a two day affair getting the drivers right) however I cannot get linux to be recognized.  In research I found that the linux that ships with this computer is built just for this computer and not publicly released.  So I don't know why ASUS wouldn't have restored that.Ultimately despite the ridiculousness above, I still LOVE this machine(back to three stars), but only because I fixed it MYSELF best I could.  Returned the second computer purchased and use the first item daily (but I definitely miss Linux and it's frustrating that I'm stuck in Windows....)", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far so good, beside one major flaw, read on to find out!", "Author": "V", "ReviewID": "R1866HVVEZ6M4Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": null, "Date": "April 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic little laptop", "Author": "Greg Taylor", "ReviewID": "R2FNZE6U9SVIZR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The build and construction of the laptop is great. It feels solid, looks great, and it's super small and light. The keyboard and screen are very nice, though I do wish there was an option to get a non-glare type screen. I'm not used to these multi-touch touchpads so I'm still getting used to it, but so far it's slightly annoying having to click the whole pad instead of a separate tactile button and I haven't quite mastered it. Damn you Apple for popularizing both the touchpad with no buttons and the glare-type screen. Very minor complaints though; this really is a nice laptop--not just for the money; its a fantastic value--it feels like quality hardware that might cost much more.Out of the box I scraped the stickers off the front, booted it and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64-bit was installed. The wireless worked right away (another older reviewer had trouble with theirs which had 10.04 installed I believe). One interesting thing is they had all the package repositories disabled, so you should go and enable them to get updates and to install more software. Another reviewer also commented on the interesting partition configuration. There is a small EFI partition required for boot, then a 3GB backup partition which I assume contains the original configuration, then a 175GB EXT4 root partition, an 8 GB swap partition, and the remaining space is configured as an NTFS partition, which auto-mounts and shows up on the desktop. It's usable space but quite odd that they did this.I prefer Xubuntu and I also wanted to use full-disk encryption as well as wipe out the odd partition config, so I downloaded the latest 64-bit (required for EFI) Xubuntu iso and used usb-creator-gtk to create a bootable USB 3.0 thumb drive with it. I allowed the installer to wipe out the existing installation and enabled FDE. I encountered no problems and it went quite smoothly and surprisingly fast. They really make it easy these days.The performance is great for what I am doing which is web browsing, email, Spotify, Skype, Dropbox, and the occasional software development in Eclipse. I do my heavy lifting on a decked-out desktop, so this is a perfect product for me. Everything feels quite responsive. The Skype video quality is great. My girlfriend who is a computer novice has no trouble logging in and using it either. She has a Macbook and likes to use this laptop more and she even complimented it on it's looks. I'm glad I went with this instead of the Acer Chromebook. The hardware seems nicer and if you plan on putting Linux on it anyway as I was, this might be a better product. Before I bought it I thought I might want to swap in an SSD, but the system is plenty responsive enough for me as is.I'm very happy with this purchase.EDIT: I've had the laptop for about 2 weeks now. I've decided the touchpad is pretty weak. I'm slightly downgrading my rating from a 5 to a 4.

This little unit fit the bill perfectly.This particular model includes Ubuntu out of the box, but I am not really into the pure Ubuntu experience. So I installed my favorite lightweight Distro which is based on Ubuntu 14.04LTS called \"Linux Lite\" in 64-bit (if you have not tried it you would be surprised how awesome it is). I tested windows 7 first for fun and it works pretty well on this thing, but opted to run it in VirtualBox with Linux Lite as the host, just in case I absolutely need it for something. All the hardware worked out of the box in Linux Lite.This thing is not a powerful beast like a full sized laptop might be. Since it easy fits into the category of a \"netbook\" it is, in a sense, a stripped down version of a laptop. There is no optical drive, installs must be done with other means such as USB. As a whole it seems like sturdy construction, the fan is quiet, the charger is much smaller in size and more discrete than the bigger laptop \"powerpack\" I am used to. Which helps make it more mobile and has decent length at about 8 feet (just a guess). Real world battery life is about 4 hours. I am sure this thing will serve me well for years to come.Notes: I find that it helps to set the touchpad to \"disable while typing\", which deactivates the pad for a set amount of time after a key stroke (default is 2 seconds). Otherwise your typing will get interrupted when you accidentally rub the touchpad and click on something. The hard drive is removable and it would be a great idea to drop in an SSD drive.

It's worth noting that, like others have mentioned, the Ubuntu install that comes on this computer has serious issues in terms of wireless connectivity. This was not really problematic for me, because I intended to install Arch from the beginning--and I did, and it works without issue. I imagine the issue is probably fixable via methods not involving installing another distro or a newer version of Ubuntu, but it's worth noting for those who may not want to deal with a laptop unwilling to immediately have reliable wireless connectivity (if this is descriptive of you, though, you're probably not the type of person who should be buying a machine with Linux pre-installed anyway).This laptop is seriously the most adorable thing I own; it's essentially the babiest laptop ever.
