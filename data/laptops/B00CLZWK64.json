There is a reason why.  Microsoft 8 is killing the PC market.  I bought an HP laptop with Windows 8 several months ago and it is a horror.  I hate the computer.  I have researched and Windows 8.1 does not appear to be much better and it is not even available yet.  And so I just ordered 2 of these laptops to get Windows 7 while they are still available. It is difficult to find them in stores.  My software is not compatible with Windows 8, many files do not work, my scanner did not work, my printer is agonizingly slow.  It is a HORROR. Microsoft should recall all of the Windows 8 computers it sold.", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mostly very pleased", "Author": "Cas Walker", "ReviewID": "RVYF246BD0BBL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm mostly very pleased with this laptop. The big screen and the performance are great.The big 17.3 inch screen comes at a price for portability. It weighs 7 pounds. That's a bit much to carry in my hand or on one shoulder but not as bad in a backpack. I've been using a backpack on little luggage cart. That may seem like a lot of bother but I really like this big screen.This past week I tried to use my USB3 Toshiba 1 TB portable hard drive on each of the USB3 ports. But it kept disconnecting & reconnecting making it unusable. I tested other USB3 portable drives and had the same spontaneous disconnect problem. These drives work fine on the USB3 ports of my Win8 Samsung laptop & my Win7 Dell desktop. These portable USB3 drives get power from the USB3 port.Acer recommended reinstalling the USB3 driver and that fixed things for 3 of my 4 USB3 portable drives. But not the Toshiba 1TB drive, it still disconnected occasionally.From Googling I found the disconnecting problem is common & vexing with USB3 portable drives on a lot of Win 7 & Win 8 computers. I tried turning off Win7's USB power control but it didn't help. Both my portable drives work fine on the Acer's USB2 ports but not at USB3 speed.I read that the disconnecting problem might be due to the drives starving for power so I ordered a HooToo USB3 hub with its own power supply. That fixed it, the Toshiba USB3 drive now works reliably.I hope other reviewers will comment on their experiences using portable USB3 hard drives on the Acer's USB3 ports.==================On 11 July I commented on someone else's review:I just got mine and had to check on your comment about the one RAM slot. I took off the bottom cover and found one slot with a 4GB SODIMM, and a separate second RAM slot that's empty. I expected it to have two 2GB RAM sticks. Having just one 4GB stick and an empty slot is much better because upgrading only required buying one stick. Alas upgrading to 8GB didn't noticeably change performance. It was already doing fine with 4GB. If you do upgrade RAM use CPU-Z to check the specs of the supplied 4GB stick. I had to look around to find another that matched it. I bought CORSAIR Vengeance 4GB PC3 12800, Model CMSX4GX3M1A1600C9 and that works. It has the same high performance as the original RAM.I was shocked to find this laptop has an empty bay for a second hard drive. There's no \"caddy\" to secure a second drive inside the bay but having the space and the SATA+power ports is very cool. (I found the caddy for $30 w/shipping at itec4less.com)I also found the supplied 500GB hard drive is a Seagate Momentus Thin ST500LT012 5400 RPM with 16MB Cache. 16MB HDD cache in an inexpensive laptop is an unexpected nice surprise. Every laptop in this price range I've seen have HDD's with 8mb cache. The extra drive cache will be a welcome little performance boost.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "To be used in motorhome", "Author": "wiyndog", "ReviewID": "RA0DUD0RZE7FS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this laptop for use as  a full-time RV'er.  It has Windows7!!!  I already increased the RAM to 8gb (the max).  I mainly use the computer for web browsing and record keeping; no games or video processing.  Everything on the computer has worked great, so far.  The built-in wifi is fast.  I don't use the touch pad, I have a trackball which I use on the right side, where I am constantly bumping into the headphone plug-in.

Alcorn \"Warren\"", "ReviewID": "RPY2ZJLP2DBJZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased my Acer Aspire through Amazon for less than $500 and have no regrets, as it's well designed and even has a 'reader' slot for SD & other cards, to download photos, etc.  I chose this Acer with Windows 7 (Premium Home edition) as it's far easier to navigate than Windows 8!  I especially like the fact that it has LED backlighting for super sharp resolution.  I chose this brand after talking to some computer specialists who believes this is one of the more reliable laptops on the market.  So far so good, as I bought it early June.  If you have the room, pay a little more than a smaller screen and get the 17.3-inch screen, as it's awesome.", "Date": "July 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Windows 7 Easy Transfer with this Acer worked for me!", "Author": "Susan Bame", "ReviewID": "R1PUXP7TT1MSXA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My 7-year-old Sony Vaio laptop with Windows 7 needed to be replaced fast, and I bought this one several weeks ago.  I should also say that I own a MacBook Air, an iPad version 3, and an iPhone, and use all of them and take all of them to work with me on an almost-daily basis.  I created some databases with Microsoft programs on my Sony laptop, and try as I did, I couldn't figure out a good, efficient, quick and easy way to transfer the databases from the Sony to the Mac, unfortunately.  Buying the Acer was my solution.I transferred the files from the Sony to the Acer using the Windows 7 Easy Transfer program -- which wasn't all that Easy, but I figured it out.  What I learned about Easy Transfer was that I had to go in and actually make sure the files I wanted were checkmarked -- which included file folders with all my existing work-related Word documents, and my photos -- and then transferred using my high-speed wireless network.  It took a while, but it worked.  And, thanks to some advice from a computer-geek friend, the first thing I did before transferring any files was I uninstalled Microsoft Office Professional from my Sony computer and installed it on the Acer, then did Easy Transfer.  So now I have a nice big *working* computer that will last me a few more years while I figure out a better answer to the database and client-tracking quandary on my Mac.I have had no problems with the Acer, with the packaging, the battery, any of that -- that was all perfect.  Delivery with Amazon Prime was two days after I placed the order, which always amazes me.  The fact that I was able to set up the computer and get it running the way I want it, by myself, was also amazing.  This was a good choice for what I wanted and needed to keep my business going.I also bought a new case to go with the Acer:  B0029L5SQ4  This has room enough in it for the Acer cables and my iPad and bluetooth keyboard and all the cables &  to go with the iPad.It's great to be able to take my whole office with me when I'm going between home and the office, carrying my Acer, MacBook Air, iPad and iPhone in two bags.  I still prefer doing most of my work on my Mac -- I love the feel of the keyboard and the elegant design of the Mac, but most of the world I work with still uses Microsoft for everything, so I must use the Acer for that part of my life.  This was definitely a good purchase for me and I'd recommend it to others.  The Windows 7 Easy Transfer program was also a big plus.", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Brilliant Display and it uses Windows 7", "Author": "Diane", "ReviewID": "R3JFW0HU6EELZJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good looking large format display (17\") - loaded with Windows 7 which is a major plus with none of the Windows 8 stuff getting in the way. The wifi is amazing fast and Netflix is no problem and other downloads seem almost instantaneous.The keyboard is not as good as the equivalent Toshiba but very usable. The CD/DVD reader/writer works flawlessly and having 2 USB 3.0 ports and 2 USB 2.0 ports plus hdmi and svga makes for a very competent machine at the price.The intel chip is only a dual processor but unless you are doing heavy video editing it keeps up quite well.I added an extra 4Gb memory with no problem but with Windows 7 there have been few times that I have needed the extra RAM.The hard disk is plenty large enough and seems to work fast with few delays even when fetching 1+Gb video files.The machine comes pre-loaded with the usual irritants such as 30 day free trial of anti-virus software. So you will need to spend a little time removing these unless you intend to subscribe.Battery life is a bare 4 hrs on most of my early tests.Overall rating - brilliant laptop that is good substitute for a 'mobile' desktop.", "Date": "October 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Purchase", "Author": "Darrell Marcum", "ReviewID": "R1LUU1F69SEBVR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I first purchased a couple for some employees.

Taormina", "ReviewID": "R59E80ECYATDX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I agree with one of the previous reviewers,the keyboard is not good. If you don't hit the spacebar in the center it doesn't work. I'm not a fast typer and this really slows me down. I spend more time correcting than creating. I would NOT buy this machine again, it's really poor quality. I saved a few hundred bucks, but I've used that much in aggravation in two days. The service and delivery from Amazon was good.As a follow up,I just spoke with Acer support. After allowing them access to my machine for diagnosis, they claim it is a software problem which is not covered in the warranty.They offered me a software warranty for $400 for three years under which they could repair the problem. It was a pretty intense sales pitch. It feels like a physical problem to me, the keys, especially the space bar don't work properly.So, no help from Acer for my 2 day old machine! Maybe it's my imagination, but the machine seems worse after they got into it. I definetly will not deal with this company again", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pros and Cons", "Author": "H&H Home Inspection", "ReviewID": "R2M0SLD9SG8PWB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop because of other reviews and also previous experience with Acer (I have owned another Acer laptop and liked it).  I really like the larger screen.  As my eyesight fades with age,it is very helpful to have.  The speed of the computer, etc. are all good, and it is a very nice looking product.Typing on it (uh, its main purpose) is not so easy.  Because of the larger area for the keyboard, I'm guessing, Acer chose to add a little extra space between the keys--and I am constantly hitting the incorrect key while typing.  The spacebar is extremely insensitive and does not respond very well (or at times it will add extra spaces).A slight touch anywhere near the touchpad can cause the computer to highlight typed text, and your next keystroke then erases everything typed--VERY frustrating!  I installed TouchFreeze in an effort to eliminate the cursor from jumping around and reiserting itself at a random place within my document, but that hasn't worked for this or the text-highlighting issue.  This could be a Microsoft problem, since I had this issue on other computers, too.Another frustrating problem I am experiencing is that I am constantly being disconnected from the Internet.  A friend mentioned wanting to check my DNS settings, but this sounded like a foreign language to me; I am not well-versed in \"Computer-Ese.\"Overall, I would recommend Acer products, but probably not this specific model.  With the purchase of any computer, I would definitely recommend typing on it, getting the \"feel\" of it before purchasing.  Everyone is different, and as I've learned, the reviews of others do not mean that a product will meet my specific needs.", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good computer, but mouse drives me crazy", "Author": "Lisa Marie Piper", "ReviewID": "R1A7ILPA77UDV1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I like the computer well enough, but the mouse pad drives me insane.

The DVD playback has good resolution, with sufficient RAM (plus add-on memory capability; I haven't even needed to try that yet).  Internet is fast too.  Windows 7 OS is okay, but I do miss the 'manual override' that the older OS's still permitted - so Microsoft sells us another OS every few years, always touting its correction & perfection (a lesson learned from Apple).  I prefer the older OS's, but they are rendered obsolete after a time & we are again forced to update (not necessarily upgrade!), even though it kills functionality of older favorite software programs.
