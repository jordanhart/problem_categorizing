{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Amazing machine!", "Author": "Noj", "ReviewID": "R3DP3545FDVAGT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is everything you'd expect from a high-end gaming laptop. From inside to outside, all features and components have been designed for top notch gaming performance.This particular model utilizes Intel's latest CPU- the 4th generation i7 8 Core processor which packs more processing potential than most users will ever need.This model is loaded with 16 gigabytes of DDR3 RAM and is upgradable to 32 gigabytes. This is more RAM than most games will recommend for system requirements.The GPU is Nvidia's latest mobile model- the GeForce GTX 770m. Packing 3 gigabytes of super fast GDDR5 dedicated VRAM this bad boy will push high frame rate benchmarks even under high graphical settings. Some games will drop significantly in frame rates under super max video settings due to poor game run engines but I have never been happier with graphics performance since purchasing this laptop. This system also comes equipped with a super cooling feature at the push of a button. The fan system will kick into high gear and DROP temperatures of the CPU and GPU to extremely admirable levels making this laptop very versatile. This mobile GPU is second only to the GeForce GTX 780m which is Nvidia's top GPU model.Three USB 3.0 slots. Two USB 2.0. Top of the line networking adapters for WiFi, LAN etc... The keyboard is the new SteelSeries with a customizable backlit keyboard that may be adjusted at the touch of a button. I have to stress how comfortable and responsive this keyboard is. I have never type so fast on another keyboard. The keyboard on this laptop is truly a wonder in and of itself.The sound system is remarkable. Three speakers- left, right and bottom. Crisp and clear sound. No crackling or muffling. Even has some bass to it. The sound system is the best you can get for laptops. You won't be disappointed.THE ONE FLAW...This particular model comes with only a 7200RPM HDD. It has an open bay to add a solid state drive which will greatly increase performance when and if you upgrade. The system comes with a mounting bracket specifically for this SSD upgrade. It will be located inside the box with the power supply in a sealed bag. Windows will score this laptop at a very insulting 5.9 due to the HDD being the lowest sub score. The processor and memory score a whopping 7.9 and the graphics/gaming graphics score a very nice 7.1. Once upgraded, this laptop will score an all around 7.1.Buyers will be pleased nonetheless. I am so happy with this system.", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect!", "Author": "Valentine Palazkov", "ReviewID": "R3Q07GPN895XY4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got it about 3 weeks agoQuite powerful.

Just remember to turn off protected mode in IE security settings and disable active filtering.

Being unfamiliar with the MSI brand, I had reservations concerning quality, but I went ahead and bought it as a gaming machine, and it has not disappointed.  I also use it for software development (mostly Java and android programming so far).  The only real complaint I have is the Page Up and Page Down keys also double as the Home and End keys via the Fn key.  This isn't that big of a deal for most users, but for a programmer this is a serious pain.  I probably actually use Home and End more often than I use Page Up and Page Down.

Quality feel; doesn't feel plastic and cheap.  Keybaord is responsive and quiet. Backlighting is nice as it helps in low light situations.  Screen and display is crisp and bright at 50% brightness.  Battery charge is decent if the Nvida GPU isn't engaged.  Runs quiet as well but when the fan revs up under load it will be noticed; louder than most desktops I think.I've only run into 2 issues and potential issue, which I haven't yet figured out: 1) Nvida drivers won't update, 2) Sims 3 will not run.  On 1), the driver update will start to Install then fail due to not finding \"compatible hardware\".  Everything seems to be working with Nvida graphics; Device manager shows its working properly, Nvida driver website recognizes the GPU and recommends the driver update.  Running it or saving it and then running it locally results in the same error.On 2) the game loads fine but when it enters game mode from a typical install and game updates from launch console, Windows displays a messages that it had problems and is terminating the TS3 program.  Made recommended adjustments the DEP and then game goes into \"game mode\" but then blacks out\".  Sometimes get a popup saying TS3.exe has been prohibited from accessing graphics hardware.  Only way out is hard reboot.  The kids weren't happy but I uninstalled the program and will continue to look for a solution.  THe potential issue deals with the BD burner not always recognizing a disc I load.  SOmetimes I'll have to open and close the drive several times before it will recognize its loaded and display in Explorer.Win 8 is just a terrible interface for laptop/desktop use.  Not efficient at all.  Some movements from the mouse or touchpad will take you from your app or desktop window to the tile window.  Just very annoying.If you don't want a big and heavy laptop then don't buy this.  The physical specs are pretty true; it's big, barely fits in my Victronoix messenger which is for most 17\" laptops.  The power unit is also big and heavy.

Because I am by no means a computer expert I brought it to a computer repair center locally where that my friend owns. They confirmed it was a defective machine. Amazon shipped me another one next day. (I had paid for next day when I ordered) If I had to go through MSI it would have taken weeks. This confirmed why I love to purchase through Amazon Prime.As for the laptop, when I received my replacement I brought it to the computer shop and they updated to 8.1 and took off Norton Anti-Virus for ESET NOD32 Anti Virus. $59 for 2 year which I am very happy with. Seems to work great without messing with performance. I do not game and bought this for video editing. Have Adobe Creative Cloud and this can handle everything I need and then some. Very sturdy build but I can still bring on the road if I need to do video editing. Most of my travel is in the car. Only wish for me is if the mouse pad was a little bigger but everything else is great including the keyboard which was important to me.IMPORTANT: Tip I learned from the computer repair center. When updating computer. After you update Windows get all the updates for the driving for Nvidia, Killer, etc. from the MSI website. They have a Live Update app that will pull all updates for all the devices for this model computer for you. If you get the updates from the company website you could have compatibility issues.", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice laptop", "Author": "tongtong.wu", "ReviewID": "R2PAPM8JZ2QP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think this is a very good laptop.

I was given an MSI GX620 notebook from my previous company as a reward after completing a project for them and I have had no trouble with that laptop at all and I've put it through just about everything you can possibly throw at a computer - video editing, web design, running continuously, etc. so I figured I would stick with MSI for a new laptop and have had my eye on these G series models for well over a year.The only complaints I have is only to do with Windows 8/8.1 driver support so that is not really MSI's fault at all. I have discovered that basically the only USB 3.0 devices that I can use with this laptop are the WD Passport series hard drives. Any other type of a USB 3.0 device will really cause problems and/or not even be recognized at all. Before trying this notebook, I tried a new HP Touch Smart Envy laptop and I had no problems with any other USB 3.0 devices on that. I guess MSI uses the Intel USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller and HP uses a different model. There are lots of problems with the Windows 8 drivers on the Intel USB 3.0 host controller and neither Intel or Microsoft want to release a new more compatible driver. But that's rumbling again and has nothing to do with MSI.The other complaint is that this one only came with Windows 8 instead of the new Windows 8.1. Microsoft says that you can easily do an upgrade from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 through the Store, which would be fine and dandy if they would give you the option of performing a clean install instead of only making you upgraded the current version to 8.1.  I have tried over and over again to upgrade and can never get the upgrade to result in a perfect Windows 8.1 system. However, I have no problems with performing a clean install of 8.1 and everything runs smoothly and flawlessly. I hate the original Windows 8 and really cannot stand it. Microsoft never should have released 8 because it wasn't ready. 8.1 does a really great job to finish the operating system off and make it more complete and polished. In fact, I really like 8.1 a lot better than Windows 7! Anyway, I ended up going out and purchasing a copy of Windows 8.1 Pro (on sale) to use so that I can do the clean install and not have to bother with all the problems of upgrading Windows. It would have been nice if MSI could have shipped this machine with 8.1 on it instead so that I would not have needed to purchase a full copy of it. All I would have needed is just an ISO image of 8.1 and I'd be all set.", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great high-end gaming laptop for the price.", "Author": "Rhett Facer", "ReviewID": "R2TZTTOLCNCE9L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great high-end gaming laptop!  It feels very solid, and the keyboard isn't too bad for a laptop keyboard.  Runs all of my games on highest graphic settings.  Doesn't seem to have any overheating issues.  The webcam is turned off by default unless you use a keyboard command to turn it on.My only complaint so far would be the integrated Intel graphics card and nVidia graphics card conflicting with each other, and sometimes the integrated card will try to run a game instead of the nVidia GPU (I'm guessing this is designed this way to save battery life when not gaming).  This is fixed by setting power settings to \"high performance\" and making sure that the nVidia graphics card is selected as the primary GPU under the nVidia control panel.  In my case, I had to reinstall my nVidia GPU drivers in order to set the nVidia GPU as the default GPU properly.The keyboard LEDs don't serve much purpose but it does make it look pretty (you can customize colors and set lighting patterns based on 3 keyboard sections), and makes gaming at night time nicer.Also, I installed a 512GB Samsung 840 Pro SSD as the primary drive, and changed the 750GB HDD to a secondary data drive.  With Windows 8 and the SSD, boot up time is frighteningly fast!

For the price, which isn't the price you can always find it on Amazon for, this was a great value.  The components are comparable to high end laptops like Ailenware, but the computer costs less!  Starts up in 20 seconds or less so the spinning HD is very fast as it is.  Overall the computer is very cool looking.  The keyboard feature that lights up the keys and allows you to change the color pattern is really cool.  I think this feature is to help you focus on only those keys you use for gaming by lighting them up a separate color.  Even if it really has no purposeful function, I can tell you it wows a teenager.  The typing on the keyboard is very nice and effortless.  The computer has metal case components that make it very sleek.  Windows 8 takes getting used to, but its ok I guess.  I think I need to learn how to get the most out of it.  I have been using Vista previously so I'm behind the times OS wise.. Regarding the gaming, I have to say my son has not complained about any game he has played on it.  The 3GB DDR5 memory video, I believe, is a great feature of this computer.  It has good cooling.  Due to my mess up and/or a problem with Windows 8.1 upgrade (that my son downloaded after we had bought the computer) disabling the recovery disc function on the computer, I also had to call technical support for help.

They even answered general questions I had about installing an SSD HD so I could make the computer even faster.

And the part that really broke my heart is the fact that right under the spacebar next to the mouse pad lock button theres a bump on the glossy marquee ( dont really know how to call that part) that leads me to believe the laptop suffered tampering or its deffective or something. the best way to describe it would be to take your finger and put it on the lower left  on the part where the left Ctrl Key meets the glossy border and fllow through to the right you will feel a bump and 2 depressions along the way.
