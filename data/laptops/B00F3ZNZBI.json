I finally decided on this Dell, specifically this 7500sLV 14\" touchscreen (there is a 7501 model). The 7500 seems like a good laptop, but I have a couple of gripes. I saw a review of the 7501 where the customer complained he has a missing pixel. Well I do as well on this model, but it's not a huge issue.  But also I'm not really impressed with the highest res being so low-the standards have risen significantly but Dell doesn't provide those resolutions on this laptop. Even my 10 year old Sony Vaio had much higher res options. This can be a big deal for me, so I have until Monday to decide to keep it or return it. Windows obviously had to be upgraded to 8.1, but I'm finding the touch screen on certain internet apps doesn't respond well. Sometimes I have to touch or tap 2 or 3 times to get it to respond, even though I adjusted the touch sensitivity.  I can get over the hurdles of jumping from Windows XP to Windows 8.1, but I'm not convinced this is the laptop for me. I'll add more once I decide. In the meantime I'm giving it 4 stars because these issues are individual, subjective and I don't want to downgrade the machine, even though it has a blacked-out pixel.", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice little machine", "Author": "William Sever", "ReviewID": "R1RTZ60JDQSG0B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this machine for an associate and set it up for them.  My first real experience with a touch-screen machine and the setup/data transfer went well and as expected.The only point I would make is that I prefer NOT to have anti-virus software pre-installed on a machine.  Most of the time the manufacturer's choice is not what I want.
