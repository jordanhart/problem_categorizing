{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Was pleasantly surprised", "Author": "Bill James \"Bill\"", "ReviewID": "RIF9MRC3HTCA9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all this will not be comparison between PC and MAC. I use both as well as a few different flavors of Unix (Linux, Ubuntu, BSD) and I also own a current generation 21.5 inch iMAC that is maxed on it's hardware and 15\" MacBook Pro that is also maxed out on it's hardware.So why did I buy this and why did I buy it from Amazon. That's easy, I'm lucky enough to have a large Apple store 20 miles from my house so I have been \"playing\" with the Air ever since it's release but until now I could not justify owning one but secretly always wanted one. I will admit that I have not played too much with this particular setup until now. I bought this from Amazon because I received lots of Amazon gift cards for Christmas and needed to use them and now with the 90+ dollars off Amazon was offering, let's just say my cost out of my pocket was down in the $800.The reason I bought this was the ability to travel lite. My 15 inch is not that much heavier but I found that I just do not use all of it's features when I travel. I very rarely need more than one USB port and if I do with the Air, I'll have a small USB hub in the case. The lack of a DVD player is also not an issue for me. I can count on one hand how many times I used the one in the 15 model and that was only to install some software. I use the one in the iMAC a lot as I create video and DVD's for myself and others.I thought the smaller screen and lack of ability to add memory would be an issue but so far I have not even worried about more memory. I went into buying this Air knowing exactly what it could do and what I expected from it, but like I mentioned the ability to add more memory would be nice.Would I recommend it to someone, yes I would, but only after that person understands what it can and cannot do. If all you are going to do is run the occasional program like Office, or any of the iLife or iWork products then you will be in good shape. Start adding in most Adobe products like Photoshop CS4 and the like and you will see a performance hit as the machine is not built to do that kind of work. It will work, but it will be a bit slow. I read another review were the person says the Air is in-between a Netbook and a full fledged laptop and I'd agree with that to a point. While much more powerful than any Netbook I looked at, it is still a full fledged laptop, just toned down.As far as the price, with the 91 dollars off right now and the gift cards I got a steal and them some. I suspect that the normal price reduction is based on what Apple is suppose to release on Jan 27, 2010. This actually made me wonder if I should wait to see if a new generation Air was coming, but the price was just to hard to pass up. I doubt seriously if they do announce a different Air I would be disappointed, I like mine way too muchWhat will I do with the 15 inch, I'm going to place it in the spare bedroom for my overnight guests to use and only allow it access to the internet and not the rest of my network, they will have access to the other software on it but I'll do what the Apple stores do and make it so that a reboot literally restores the machine to a just installed setup. I've seen how they do this and it's not that much different than using the Kickstart program that comes with just about every version of Unix nowadays, this way my guests can configure it any way they would like and a full restore is jsut a reboot away", "Date": "January 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "The only indispensable computer.", "Author": "Samuel Chell", "ReviewID": "R11PYCIH4NVFRR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "[Still my most used computer and, unless you want to supplement an iPad with the optional keyboard, the best bet in terms of either a laptop or netbook--providing you have a desktop machine for the heavy-duty media work (movies, photos, tune collection).  The one thing I've missed are those stretchable, lightweight skin cases that could be fitted on to the bottom of the machine (like the ones available for the Touch).  As light as the Air is, its heat and sharp edges make an impression after extended use in one's lap.]I dropped my Air and paid the price--a steep one.  The Air has a flawed hinge design that can disintegrate, requiring replacement of the cover.  Apple is covering many of these cases, but not when the user drops the machine.  It's thin, sharp, and slippery--so such a prospect is far from unlikely.  The first two Apple repair places I went to said it was a lost cause, and charged me handsomely for the dire news. But I persisted, finally getting Apple Store itself to give me the address of a cooperative repair place.They fixed it--and for less than half of what I paid for a new model 13 months ago.  I never realized how much I missed it.  I've had a Mac Powerbook, iBook, Macbook, and tried some of the inexpensive non-Mac netbooks.  But nothing compares with a Mac Air (though, to be fair, I have yet to spend extended, intensive quality time with a Kindle).  I'm going to glue this thing to my fingers, put a parachute on it along with 2\"-thick shock absorbent material.  But if I drop it again, I'll have it repaired it again.The only computer that compares with this is a desktop model in top operating condition.  The Mac Air is not only a supreme pleasure to use but it actually motivates you to write.  Don't judge it based on its specs, lack of a hard drive, and reports by many Apple nay-sayers who have never owned the machine or used it for any length of time.  If you use a computer for writing, this is the only one worth having.  I can't understand why transforming it into an electronic slate for drawing pictures or writing by hand would be an improvement.  May Apple realize sufficient success with this machine to keep it in circulation, knowing when not to mess with a good thing.", "Date": "November 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best Mac Yet", "Author": "Riverrunner", "ReviewID": "ROTPOVF5LIYGP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had a macbook for years.

No longer state of the art, the Macbook Air is still superb at doing what it does. Compared with the new MacBook Pro 13 you give up battery life, speed, and storage. What do you gain? A computer you can, and will, take with you everywhere. (I am writing this review as I watch the BBC news.) A computer that is so so thin and so light that you will be delighted each time you pick it up. As another reviewer noted, if you are a writer, this is your machine. It is a writer's notebook you will take everywhere with an illuminated keyboard and a superior screen. Does it make sense to buy a Macook Air? It has not been substantially updated for two years-- lifetimes in the tech world. It is expensive and it is Apple's slowest computer. If you can be happy with another Macbook, by all means buy one. If you suspect you will not be happy with anything but the lightest, most portable MacBook, well, you won't be disappointed. In fact, if you're anything like me, you'll be delighted.", "Date": "May 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "So great we had to buy another!", "Author": "N.

I'm not a techie so for me it is a perfect fit.  I own a desktop mac and can do on it what I can't on the Air.  The Air is great for travel or just to carry around the house when I don't want to be pinned down to my desk.  It is super light weight.  Yes, it meant shelling out some serious change for what is basically a Netbook on steroids but unlike a Netbook, it is substantial.  Full keyboard, GREAT screen, etc., etc., etc.  Then again, the new IPad may fill those needs for others.  Your choice.

The MacBook Air with the SSD option is great.I love the thin profile, light weight and speed of this computer.  In the 2 weeks since it arrived from Amazon, I've been streaming my iMac's iTunes library (music and video) to the Air, watching YouTube, general Internet use, email, gaming (Quake III and Pangea Arcade.)The system is very responsive and doesn't really heat up much unless I'm playing a game or watching video (iTunes or YouTube) for a while.  The fan is pretty quiet and quickly ramps down when the processor idles back.  The LED-backlit screen is great as is the backlit keyboard.  Typing is a pleasure with this keyboard and I thought I wouldn't like it from the pictures.As many have pointed out, it would be nice to have easier access to the USB port.  I happen to have an extension USB cable that I use to connect a 32GB thumb drive.  The thumb drive casing is too large to fit the port otherwise.  I'm planning on getting the Air Superdrive soon.  However, using Remote Disc from my iMac was super easy and trouble free.Battery life seems fine, as I'm getting about 4 to 5 hours if I'm conservative with the backlight.  This is with WiFi on and Bluetooth off.  We have an Airport Extreme (dual network) base station and I'm getting full network connectivity throughout the house.I do wish the vents on the back/underside were a bit different, as they appear to be prone to getting covered up if not on a flat surface.  I'll be getting iWork and Photoshop Elements 8 in a few days and will see how those apps work.  I haven't connected my Canon EOS 40D camera yet, but expect the Air to be a great traveling companion to the camera.All in all, I'm a very satisfied owner of the MacBook Air.  Amazon was a pleasure to order from as usual.", "Date": "December 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Perfect laptop for most people", "Author": "Dave94", "ReviewID": "R3MEXCMWPKNEXR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first Apple Macbook and after struggling between purchasing the Air or Pro I have no regrets.  First, it is obvious that this is not the best value between the two.  You get much more bang for your buck with the Pro.  The key in making the choice to the Air at least for me was to look at my needs and uses. I wanted a light and portable laptop that I would use around the house and occasionally take on trips.  The next item of concern was the 128Gb hard drive.  I am not a gamer and my itunes library consists of 1000 songs and a few movies.  I would recommend anyone considering the Air look at your current laptop or desktop and view your  memory usage.  I was surprised when I looked at my 5 year old Dell to find only 26GB in a 250GB hard drive used.  Again, the Dell is 5 YEARS OLD.  Unless you have a vast media library you will never use it up.  Finally, the lack of ports and optical drive.  I have no need to hook up via ethernet and I can't remember the last time I used a disk since everything can be downloaded wirelessly.  These are the reasons why the Air works for me, and why I feel that anyone who has similar uses will find the Air the perfect laptop.  Regarding performance, the SSD makes everything run so much quicker.", "Date": "October 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best apple product I have ever purchased.", "Author": "jloughnot", "ReviewID": "RVT64ARNW16S7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a creative professional and have multiple computers including a MacPro 8 core with 16g Ram, 27''iMac, Macbook pro 15'' i7, iPad, iPhone, iPod, etc.  In my opinion this is the future of computing.

I learned how to use a computer with an Apple.  Eventually, sometime the switch to a PC happened and I never really looked back.  I purchased other Apple products, like an iPod, iPhone, etc, but I never intended to purchase an Apple laptop.After selling my pink Croc Sony VAIO, I was looking for something lighter, smaller, and a little more \"grown up\", since I'm now out of college and in the work force.  No one takes you seriously when you have a pink crock laptop.  I was contemplating a Vivienne Tam HP mini, but I saw a pop up add for the Macbook Air and googled it....and decided this was it.I bought my first one on eBay, which was one of the earlier models.  I LOVED it, absolutely adored it.  It was perfect.  However, it had problems and the eBay seller took it back and refunded me.  I then went ahead and bought the current model MC234LL/A, with warranty and AppleCare and I couldn't be happier.  I LOVE it!For my purposes, it can be used a sole machine, especially this upgraded version.  It's light, fast, and the screen quality is excellent.  I will never use another PC, or a different laptop.  I just can't!I did use the Vivienne Tam by the way, for a few days...and I couldn't stand it.  Maybe I'm spoiled by my MBA, but the HP Mini was SLOOOOOOOWWWER than molasses.  And the keyboard didn't feel solid under my fingers; it felt cheap and it was noisy.

The Mac Air wins out after approx 19'trials' with other laptops. I presently have the now 'old' version, though I just bought this 2.13 from Apple about 2 days ago!! Yeh, next day, the 'new improved' version is available. I do not plan to trade for it however. The new version has 2 USB ports which was much needed. Also a new 11 inch screen size is available. Perhaps the biggest improvement is the much longer lasting battery, nearly 5 hours! I would like to handle the 11 inch version, for comparison, but pretty sure I will stay with the 13 inch. I have another Toshiba netbook with the 10.5 inch screen and there is some scrolling one has to do in order to see all I want on one screen. The Mac Air is one super cool laptop at any rate. I put on Windows 7 with BootCamp utility and it really works wonderful. I have one program that still, in 2010, has not made upgrades for Mac compatibility.

B MacBook Air with the 128GB SSD for more than a year now and I can confidently say that it is the best computer I have ever used. It is certainly the best laptop I have used, including my much loved 12\" PowerBook, and I rank it slightly ahead of my venerable Mac IIci (lest you think I am ignorant of Windows, I will disclose that I also have a PC in my office in addition to an iMac and I manage many PCs at my work but prefer Macs for my own use). I especially appreciate the brilliant screen and full sized and very responsive keyboard which has excellent ergonomics. I really like the trackpad and the multitouch capabilities. Some will contend that it is the footprint that makes for a portable computer but after experiencing the ease with which this super thin and light computer can be carried around in one hand, I have to disagree. Besides, I would not sacrifice the larger screen and the full size keyboard for a smaller footprint. This computer is so easy to carry, I got rid of my laptop bag and just slip the Air into a sleeve and into my regular briefcase. The Air has been plenty fast enough for what I use it for (mainly office productivity software, but also graphing and statistical programs, numerical and symbolic mathematics, and drawing programs) and the solid state drive makes it very responsive. I am not a Youtube fanatic but the only time I (briefly) had the \"kernel task\"/overheating problem was when I was messing around trying to play some iPhoto slide shows on my TV. The problem lasted for maybe half a minute and then the slide show played fine.  I use the computer every day, generally connected to AC, but battery life is also very good. However, I have never achieved five hours running on the battery (but I haven't tried any extreme measures and always have the screen brightness set to automatic). I did not buy the external disc and don't miss it at all. The remote disc feature works fine (I used a wired ethernet connection when I upgraded the system). I did buy a powered USB hub for work since I prefer a wired ethernet connection using the USB adapter (WiFi is available, just not as useful due to network limitations) and I also have a USB drive for Time Machine backups and Super Duper clones. I did end up buying an extra USB ethernet adapter for my travel bag as many hotels (not the crummy ones, always the expensive ones) do not have WiFi available in the rooms. Leopard, and now Snow Leopard, have been very solid and I rarely turn the computer off, generally only rebooting for updates.Finally, I have noticed that I get better WiFi reception and more reliable bluetooth connections than with my previous PowerBook.I did have an occasional problem with the fan which Apple repaired. I don't see any evidence that this is a widespread problem so I am not reducing my rating. In addition, the fan is now much quieter than before and I can't hear it under normal usage even in a very quiet house.I hope Apple continues to update the Air as I don't know that I will ever want to go back to a blockier, heavier laptop.", "Date": "September 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "A lemon", "Author": "Reader", "ReviewID": "R2IIY925XUD5X7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We purchased a Macbook Air two years ago and unfortunately it was a lemon right out of the box.  Almost immediately there were problems with pixels on the screen going out in large vertical bands, over-heating, sluggish performance.  We purchased it for our son to use during extended travel in China, reasoning that the light weight would be a plus in these circumstances.  Unfortunately, Apple doesn't have any service in China so he was unable to get the problems fixed.When he returned from China we took the Air into Apple for repairs.  That was the beginning of a long cycle of multiple repairs and the nightmare of dealing with Apple service.  I've never encountered so many frustrations with a computer company.  Perhaps if you've ever had any serious problems with an Apple product you might know what I'm talking about.It seems that other reviewers have been pleased with their Air, so it is entirely possible that our experience was the exception rather than the rule.  However, a lemon should be caught by Apple's quality control process BEFORE it goes out the door, before it gets into an unfortunate customer's hands -- and that didn't happen in this case.Some things a potential buyer should be aware of...  The Air is basically a stripped down computer, with things such as a CD/DVD drive not included, in order to reduce the weight.  But you still need these components.  By the time I had purchased the additional items, including the expensive CD/DVD drive, the total package not only came close to $3000, but weighed significantly more than my small, light weight Sony which is a fully loaded computer, including DVD drive and extended life battery.Finally, from our experiences with trying to get the Air repaired, we learned that many of the internal components, including the hard drive, are non-standard and not easily replaced when they go bad.  When my Sony died after 5 years, I was able to remove the hard drive, a miniaturized Toshiba, and transfer it to an external case, enabling me to continue using my data with another computer.  Not so with the Air.  When the Air died recently, although still under the extended warranty, Apple was unable to offer any assistance in removing the hard drive.  Their service dept. said that the Air hard drive is non-standard and that Apple doesn't service it at all and that it can't be removed.  We gave up on Apple and took the Air to a local PC lab that was able to remove the hard drive and transfer the data to a new device which can be used externally.To be fair, we've had other Apple products that have performed well and that we've been mostly happy with.  Now, however, the frustration level, not to mention time and expense, in dealing with the Macbook Air and Apple service has turned us off to Apple forever.  We'll be sticking to PCs from now on.  Our Air, which still has more than a year of warranty on it, has totally died and we've dumped it for an Asus.  Check them out, they get excellent reviews (rated highest for reliability), have incredible battery life (10-14 hours), have an amazing warranty, and they make some very lightweight models (the UL series).", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great for traveling!", "Author": "muraty", "ReviewID": "R1PBA5LW4BEQ0K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Super light, very user friendly... overall good price for what you get.Love MAC OS X, it is all about the ease of use and seamless software and hardware integration.Not recommended for desktop replacement!!", "Date": "January 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very good computer, some small problems", "Author": "Online Shopper", "ReviewID": "R112V10WBQF31V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall, a good computer.
