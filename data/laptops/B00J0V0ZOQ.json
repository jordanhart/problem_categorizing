This is my first Lenovo (formerly IBM) laptop and I am still tryingto figure out the little red button; however, based on my limited use I am very pleased and I have every reason to believe onceI fully exercise the unit, I will be very satisfied.  This unit is a back up for my desktop and I do not use it nearly as often as I use thedesktop.  Expect to really exercise it the next time I travel for any extended period of time.  I have not been pleased with Lenovo'stechnical support, so this review is for the actual laptop, not manufacturers support!I have been very impressed with Eluktronics, the computer reseller who modifies computers with various upgrades and then services what it sells.  I really like their business model because rarely have I found any off-the-shelf laptop with the configuration that I wanted.  I have had contact with the CEO, emails and telephone, I am convinced that Eluktronics will be my first stop for any future computer needs.  Based on my experience I believe Eluktronics is committed to Customer Service!  I consider them agreat little company plus I have always supported the small business entrepreneur...they keep our USA ticking!!!", "Date": "June 8, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$899.99", "Features": "Windows 7 Professional 64-Bit; AMD Elite A6-5350M 2.9GHz up to 3.5GHz Turbo Core Accelerated Processor\n15.6\" diagonal LED-backlit HD anti-glare display (1366 x 768); 8GB DDR3L 1600MHz PC3-12800 RAM (2 Dimm)\n1TB Hybrid 8GB NAND SSD 5400RPM SATA III Hard Drive; AMD Radeon HD 8450G Graphics; DVD+/-RW\n802.11b/g/n; Gigabit Ethernet; Webcam; 3 x USB 3.0; USB 2.0; 6-Cell 48 Wh Li-Ion Battery (Up to 6.2 hours)\nSpill-Resistant Keyboard with Numeric Keypad; Dolby Audio V2; HDMI; VGA; 1 Year Lenovo Warranty", "Name": "Lenovo ThinkPad Edge E545 20B20011US AMD Elite 15.6\" Windows 7 Professional Business Notebook PC (A6-5350M 2.9GHz, 1TB Hybrid SSD Hard Drive, Windows 7 PRO Laptop, 8GB RAM)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/319%2BXp6ceeL.jpg", "ProductID": "B00J0V0ZOQ"}}
