Finney", "ReviewID": "RHJPAKBTYG27Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Though I have only had this computer for about 5 days, I am liking what I'm seeing.  It's fast, has a great display, and is running all the additional software, that I've loaded, without a hitch.  It even was willing to run my HP printer without downloading the specific drivers from HP.  The keyboard is comfortable, and is not cramped as was the case with my netbook.  The dedicated numeric keypad is also a definite plus.  When hooked to an external monitor, I don't have to tell the computer to turn on the external display, it does it automatically.  The trial software that comes with Windows 7 is a pain, but is easily removed.  It isn't necessary to shell out a bunch of cash on Microsoft Office when Open Office is readily available as a free download.  This past weekend when I had some free time I popped a movie into the DVD drive, and enjoyed a couple of hours of downtime.  I hooked up some USB powered speakers to enhance the sound a bit, and was set.  The picture quality while watching movies was great!  I will update this review as I gain more experience with this laptop, though I doubt that I will have anything negative to add.  It looks as though this computer is a gem.  I let you know if I continue to think that way.  Right now I'd say that it merits my recommendation to anyone looking for a very nice laptop. ***Update*** Having had my VAIO for a while now, I can still claim that it's a great computer.  So far no hardware, nor OS problems with it at all.  I got crazy last week and decided to double the memory.  I went to Crucial.com and ordered 2 sticks of 4 gigs of memory.  Mind you that the memory I put in is almost double the speed of the old.  The difference was instantly obvious.  Not only do applications load faster, the computer boots up in about 40 seconds!  I subscribe to the belief that it is impossible to have too much memory, and this experiment seems to have bolstered my argument.  In summation, this is a great computer.  It does what I want, and does it well.  I can, and will recommend the Sony VAIO(R) VPCEE23FX/T E Series 15.5\" Notebook PC to anyone wanting a great little laptop!", "Date": "August 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "After 3 weeks, still an Amazing Laptop!", "Author": "Ivan \"The Consultant\"", "ReviewID": "R1WCQY9ZB6WRJ9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first under $700 laptop ever and I have to say that this is an extraordinary product.Awakes from stand-by in 4 seconds and from hibernation in about 12 seconds. My colleagues, family, and friends are impressed by its processing speed. Truly!Despite its large 15.5\" screen it isn't heavy in my briefcase. Maybe because of the lighter than usual power charger, which I also like because of its cable junction design (it won't break as with all my previous HPs)If I wanted something different I probably asked for a larger hard drive, but, I worry that making any change may mess its apparently unique configuration.", "Date": "August 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop for a Bargain Price", "Author": "Jeneane P", "ReviewID": "R157TEZ738VUYG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After doing some light research, I bought this laptop as a quick fix to serve as my go-to AutoCAD tool for school.  I already have a Mac so the stakes were high for this machine.  Right out of the box the thing worked like a charm.  It detected my wi-fi and printer in almost seconds so I was ready to go.  Loading the AutoCAD software was easy as well, no hiccups, and I've been able to use it consistantly for 3 months without incident.  Overall, I'm extremely pleased with this laptop and I have to say Windows 7 isn't half bad either.  I have yet to spring for the full-blown MS Office 2010, but the Office Starter that comes with the machine has worked perfectly enough that I find I don't need the full version yet.  I'm able to work in Excel and Word without a problem, inclusive of editing and creating new docs.  I use Excel a LOT and have yet to be hindered with the Office Starter capabilities.  It is a free tool, which means there are ads present, but they are shuffled to the right margin and never jump out into the document itself. Granted, you lose a fair chunk of working space, but it IS a free tool so consider what you are getting for the money.  For my school needs, I'm just fine working around that for now.A couple nits:1) the constant Windows Updates.  It seems like everyday, either Windows or VAIO wants to load something new on my machine.  I've started becoming selective based on my needs, but if this sort of thing doesn't bother you then its a non-issue.  It has died down since the first days of having the machine so it probably just needed to catch up with the current info once it started up for the first time.2) the screen is HIGHLY reflective and that can get annoying if your light source isn't in the exact, right spot.  I've not quite found that sweet spot, but it's definitely not behind or directly overhead.  Off to the side and not directly pointed at the screen seems to work well.Other reviews I read poo-pooed the power cord placement on the side of the laptop vs. the back, but this hasn't been a thorn in my side or anything so it's all personal preference.For under $700, I am extremely happy with my purchase and definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a cheaper alternative that will still handle most tasks with ease.PS - I've streamed Netflix over my home wi-fi very successfully as well.", "Date": "December 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "I have had this PC for 1 1/2 years and I am still happy.", "Author": "eveningstargems", "ReviewID": "R30BMD9OX9KH9Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Though I didn't purchase my PC through Amazon,  I feel that I have an obligation to review this PC.  I bought it last August and have to say between now and then I have had it running at least 2/3 of the time since.  I fall asleep to movies in my MediaGo library.  I use it to record local music.  I use it to make music.  I go to college online with it.  I work this machine, there are always at least 4-5 programs running.  It rarely crashes because of hardware issues.  No problem running and Adobe CS5 program. This computer is truly a beast, I could keep listing what I have put this machine through all night. I have put this machine through hell, it comes everywhere with me.  In the time that I have had it, I have only had 2 issues.  The first I easily fixed myself because it was a software malfunction, I had to restore the system to factory settings which is a grueling process when you create and accumulate as much data as I do.  Though my computer is still a fully functional machine after the few hours it took to get it to where it needed to be.  The second issue is that sometimes when I put it down swiftly when it is closed, it shuts down.  The strange thing about that is.... It doesn't recognize that it shut down incorrectly when I turn it back on.  But this happens few and far between, like I said I've put this thing through the electronic equivalent of hell, and there is no handbasket involved.  I have definitely received output of data that is far beyond the financial input for this laptop.  I find SONY to be a very reliable company, any time I have had a problem or question they have been easy to deal with.  I look forward to upgrading the Hard Drive and RAM in the next coming months.  I enjoy its aesthetic, and the full sized keyboard. Its not heavy, it does run a bit hot.  The power button is awkwardly placed, I accidentally put it to sleep sometimes when I pick it up open. (reminiscent of the poorly place power switch on the PSP, when intensely involved in a game it is easy to accidentally power off... I guess that's the price we pay for smaller and smaller electronics).  All in all, if you are looking for a PC that is reasonably priced, will meet your entertainment (besides hard core gaming (though oblivion runs fine on it... prolly not skyrim though), and can handle multitasking too, SERIOUSLY consider this Machine.(BIG)prosQuality ScreenUpgradable Hard Drive, RAM, and Optical DriveFull Size Keyboardgreat for  Everyday Entertainment useand...

Closing one even longer. If a window freezes while sufacing, go get a cup of coffee because that revolving circular thingy will be going for at least a minute. It's insane. This new operating system has none of the snap that Windows XP had. Everything kind of 'floats' open, like it's in no rush. Despite having 4GB of RAM and a 320GB Hard Drive and doing little more than surfing and some word processing, this computer is just plain garbage. I will say, after my HD fried, SONY did provide excellent customer service as it was still under the one year warranty.

Everything had been great before this.  I must've spoken to 5 or 6 different tech support reps, who tried to be as helpful as possible, but kept telling me how many problems this model has. Two reps even said this model had been re-called and when I asked why I wasn't contacted, they retracted the recall statement.  I also had 2 visits from repairmen who fixed the problem but only temporarily.  I also had to pack up the computer and send it back twice but again, the problem kept on.  So, the final result was that it apparently needed a new motherboard but was past the warranty so it would cost me over $700 which was $100 more than what I paid for it!

It goes in a hard case inside a hard case inside a hard case anytime I transport it. I don't Download anything that would cause any problems. This has been an absolute nightmare.

The replacement stopped after 2 months & couldn't take back to store. Called Customer Service in October 2010. After lots of phone calls, it is December 2010 and the computer has not been repaired nor replaced... no one from SONY has looked at the computer and it is still completely non-functional.They kept telling my daughter that the part (they've never looked at the computer to see what was wrong with it) is back ordered and that they would call within 2-3 days every time she called (which was almost weekly).  The parts never came in AND they never called.  Finally, they scheduled an appointment on December 23rd to come out and repair it... You guessed it, no call...no show!!!!I spent 2 hours on the phone with SONY December 27th. They finally said that they'd send a box in to expedite a repair (after putting us off for 3 months now they want to hurry it along all of a sudden!!!!)If you're considering this computer... don't.
