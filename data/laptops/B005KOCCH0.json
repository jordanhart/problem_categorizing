Great screen and keyboard. I added 4G of RAM (total 8G). With such addition most of the applications open immediately. 650G hard drive is OK for laptop. However, most of new laptops have 750G hard disk, at least. I would rate it 5 stars, but it has really bad-bad sound.", "Date": "October 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sony laptop", "Author": "Gary of Burchard", "ReviewID": "R2CVHTRKNODTJH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Outstanding laptop, absolutely not problems and the on line backup from Sony has been very good. I am taking online classes and the larger screen is very nice. On the down side this is a heavy computer and carring it for any length of time can be tireing. I also had to buy a different case as my pervious laptop was much smaller.", "Date": "September 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "A few hiccups but otherwise great.", "Author": "Ekapa", "ReviewID": "R33NLLTOD99JGN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really like this little (well I suppose \"big\") laptop. It doesn't feel huge because it's so light but the screen size is amazing for the price. I play light games on it and it runs them perfectly. I'm also a digital artist and it runs photoshop, corel painter, etc. with no lag and no fuss. Only issue I have with it is that the screen is not good for drawing; the color difference from the top of the screen to the bottom is dramatically different even at a straight on angle of view. This sort of comes with the territory of the screens on laptops anyway but my old Toshiba with the smaller screen had a less dramatic difference.Even so, it's a fast computer. I added the extra bar of memory but I probably wouldn't have even needed it.I did have one issue where the finger pad started jumping around a bit. I found this troubling from a brand new computer but the problem went away when I rebooted and hasn't appeared since. I rarely use the touch pad anyway, so I, personally, didn't find it as a huge red flag.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great laptop!", "Author": "John Lindsey", "ReviewID": "R1L9WABXRAETYW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this laptop today and I am enjoying it so far!

Seems to move pretty good.  However, the battery life keeps draining in less than an hour.  We charged it completely then used it until it died.  The first time it died it lasted almost 3 hours.  Then we let it charge fully before using it again but it still only lasted about 2.5 hours.  I contacted the seller now they told me to contact Sony.  If I do not get this resolved it will be going back.  It has been less that a month & the battery stays charged less than an hour.  It doesn't matter what I do on it.  I could unplug it & leave it sit off & when I turn it back on it is down on battery by about 1/8.  Something definitely wrong.", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very good", "Author": "Victor Quintana", "ReviewID": "R5XLP20M2PVE8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Brand is very good and this one is the only one (I think) in Peru, I don't see this one", "Date": "April 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excelen", "Author": "Ernesto Torres", "ReviewID": "R22TJ766V38UH5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My order arrived perfectly, I recommend your purchases through this site is absolutely secure and fast, I am very satisfied with the operation.", "Date": "March 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Horrible", "Author": "Joshua Benefield", "ReviewID": "ROZ5IDC9C0N0C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This computer was extremely slow since the first time we turned it on.
