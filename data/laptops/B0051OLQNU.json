I purchased mine from HP's online store with the following specs:15\" standard screenBlu-Ray player upgradeAMD A6 ProcessorUSB 3.0 included (10x faster than USB 2.0)HDMI port (for connecting to the modern plasma screens, etc)The case is very attractive and has a sleek, grey shape.The cutting-edge AMD \"Fusion\" processor produces amazingly-smooth graphics (DVDs, Youtube HD videos, Netflix, Hulu, etc).  I run complex financial risk simulations on my DV6 laptop, and they complete within seconds.  My previous laptop, an Intel Duo Core from Geteway, took minutes to finish the simulations, but this new HP laptop finishes 5x faster!Naturally, internet browsing is awesome, as web pages seem to open within the blink of an eye.  I never realized that an upgraded laptop could make my life so much easier. The laptop is incredibly fast and powerful, yet it produces virtually no heat.I also watch BluRay movies from a projector connected to my DV6.  Again, I have to compliment the amazing graphics capabilities on this laptop; completely smooth video!!Hulu and Netflix caused my my old Intel Duo-Core laptop to stall and choke, but this new AMD-powered laptop runs completely smoothly on this laptop!  If you have broadband internet, you will never see any flickering or missed frames.At this price, the DV6 is the best value you will find.  It runs better and has a better build quality than similar laptops that are usually priced in the $800-$900 range.I think HP and AMD did a fantastic job with this laptop.  I am a very happy customer.", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Consumer beware!!", "Author": "kenpao", "ReviewID": "R2HYKI8O1LA2L1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "HP sent me a defective screen on my new HP laptop. I requested them to replace the computer and they asked me to take a quick-ship model at a higher price. In addition, I have to pay for it first at a higher price with lower specs!! I asked for the manager and they rejected me saying they are busy.I have bought 4 HP Pavilions over the last 10 years and this is how they repay me. If there are no problems, I am sure HP is fine. The real problem is if there is something wrong and you are stuck with their customer support. After 10 years, I am going with another brand. I have also spent 80 minutes on the phone with no avail.I have put a similar comment on their HP website. Do you know they exclude the 1-star and 2-star comments from the consumers?!?! Therefore, I thought it is only fair for the consumers to know. If there is something wrong and you have to deal with their customer support, you will literally get the short-end of the stick. Therefore, you should think twice before purchasing from HP.I have wasted two days of my life dealing them and now I am investing a full-day going through all the HP e-commerce sites to let the consumers know. Good luck with your purchase with HP.....", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Computer", "Author": "vito murillo", "ReviewID": "R3F07BTAFII092", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received this computer today and to tell you the truth it is an awesome computer. The display screen is flawless and just gorgious with its brightness. The updates took less then 1hour so it was pretty fast. The A6 quad core works awesome, this computer can handle anything you throw at it with awesome resolution. The speakers are so loud and sound great. The keys are nice and easy to hit, they're not like some computers which has them hard so you have to press pretty hard to use them but rather this once has it just right.  This 500dollar computer out performs a 800dollar computer any day of the week. If your thinking about purchasing a computer for school, entertainment or just to play some hard core gaming but at a reasonable price, not like those $2000 alienware computer, then this is the computer to buy. You cannot go wrong with this computer. Do Not be afraid of the 1.4ghz processor, its a A6 quad core!!! Thats four cores that work consistenly to keep up with your demand, and the weight of the work is distubited evenly to the four cores so it hardly heats up. Its literaly impossible to hear the fan. Im trying my best to listen to it and it makes almost nooo noise whatsoever.  In Summary, If you want to purchase a great computer that can handle anything you throw at it then look no more and purchase this computer immediately.", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "For the price, laptop is great!", "Author": "Tushster", "ReviewID": "R1CBW9QYO04U6O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop to replace my old Gateway.The specs of this computer are fantastic!The 4GB of memory is definitely enough to run most common software. 640GBs of hard drive space is going to take a LONG time to fill.Unfortunately, the A6-3400M Accelerated Processor isn't at the top of the A6 series, but it will still help you get your tasks done. The higher processors will be found on high-end entertainment machines. I'm still happy with the chipset this laptop comes with!The AMD Radeon HD 6520G isn't top of the line either, but video quality is still pretty great! As well as gaming, I was able to run World of Warcraft (at high settings), and both Doom 3 and F.E.A.R. at medium settings each.As far as the way the laptop looks, the glossy black with silver borders looks very classy! Also, I've noticed that it prevents fingerprints on the case. That's a huge plus for me, especially coming from my old laptop which would have my fingerprints EVERYWHERE.The keyboard looks quite different than you find on most laptops. It's a full-sized keyboard with an island style number pad, which is useful for quick number typing, or whatever else you plan to do. I do have an issue with the keyboard, however: up and down arrows under the right shift key are incredibly small.The laptop is missing a fingerprint reader, which you can find on the HP DM4 series and higher end DV6s and DV7s. The 6110us doesn't come with integrated Bluetooth either. Something else that a lot of people look for is Beats Audio, which this computer doesn't have. However the built-in Altec Lansing speakers are good stock speakers, which provide decent sound quality and bass.The Windows 7 Home Premium on this laptop ships with Office 2010 starter, which is nice in some ways. It has Microsoft Word, Powerpoint and Excel, but unfortunately doesn't have all the features as the full version of Office 2010 Home and Student, Home and Business, or Professional. It will do the job if you're just planning on using it for simple tasks.Aside from the missing features which are found on higher end laptops, this machine has everything I was looking for. I'm a college student and didn't need anything super extravagant. This laptop certainly does the job, and I'm happy with my purchase.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Champion of its price category", "Author": "Bishal Sinha", "ReviewID": "R1HJ1IZHKDV1HH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got the HP-DV6-6110US after a dissatisfied experience with the Toshiba Satellite L755. Returned the satellite and picked this one up. Has a good build quality. The keyboard layout is a bit strange and needs to get used to. Keys feel a bit sticky compared to my macbook(less then half the price who's complaining). The AMD processor takes care of my needs. Surfing, basic pic editing, word documents,netflix streaming and gaming on onlive. A bit too much of bloatware but easily uninstallable. Most of these cheaper laptops have basic Windows 7 which doesnt let you backup to a wireless network drive. Plenty of connectivity options. Cant beat it at the 449 price I got it at the local staples.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "AMAZING!!!", "Author": "Tiger2014***", "ReviewID": "RC9FSOKBEWAGN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I LOVE LOVE LOVE this laptop. I was a little hesitant as their were both good and bad reviews. i wanted something that was great for gaming, music, portable and perfect for a college students. When the laptop arrived the packaging was perfect. Right out of the box, the laptop was of course brand new. When i first used the laptop, the battery lasted for 5 hours which was great since my last hp only lasted about 2. the true vision webcam could be a little more clear but the quality of the laptop overall is great. It is fast loading with documents, web browsing and gaming. The keyboard is very easy to work with and easy to clean. Overall, this is the best laptop that i have bought so far.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very good Laptop, good value!", "Author": "Tommyr", "ReviewID": "RAW6PWWBRJ85V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received my DV6 6110 last Friday from Amazon.com and I must say I'm impressed. My main machines are Macs and my 8 year old Mac Mini's HD is finally showing signs that it's dying so time for a new machine. Since my 2006 Macbook is still going strong and the new Mini does NOT have an internal optical drive I opted for a new laptop with Windows. Now I have to say, I am NOT a Windows fan. I have been Windows free for 16 1/2 years now. I bought this HP knowing that I will eventually put Linux on it but for now I'll play in Windows 7. Setup of this machine was a breeze. The set up program walks you right through it. I was online in no time flat. The screen is clear and crisp and the machine is pretty fast. Plenty of USB ports and the overall layout of things is nice. HP put in plenty of help if you need it. Things you don't want (those bloatware programs) are easily removed in the remove programs menu. I ditched Norton right off the bat and downloaded Malwarebytes. I also use Microsoft essentials. Until I switch it over to Linux that is someday. One bug a boo is that several times the battery came out when lifting the machine up. Needs a better/more sure locking mechanism. Battery life is great though! Better than most at 6 hours. Another bug a boo is my older Lacie HD was not seen by Windows (A Windows problem not an HP problem). A look around Lacie's site was no help. Windows did see my WD Mybook though. This reminded me one of the reasons why I left Windows, Macs and Linux see and let me access my Lacie drive with no problem at all. Hmmmmm. The HP DV6 6110us is a great laptop and a VERY good value and I recommend it but just remember, it does have Windows on it. Expect Windows type behavior.", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "AMD Power and Graphics~!", "Author": "Abhay Charan James", "ReviewID": "R3DBSHD3A8OFCE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Right, the Hp Dv6 with AMD A6 Quad core is a powerful little machine! It lets me do my college work  and also play games at an incredible price! The on board APU is more than adequate for most needs, although you can opt for the AMD Dual graphics too. The battery life is fair to good, I get about 3-4 hours off a single charge in real life. At this price I think people would be stupid not to buy this! paid $499 for a machine which can match and beat machines a lot more expensive from Intel. The AMD A6 3400 Quad core and the 6 gb of DDR3 ram make this a fun laptop which is good for engineering software too.Overall, I see no reason to not recommend this laptop, HP is after all #1 in the world!Thank you,Abhay", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Little Machine - watch for virus", "Author": "Warrant", "ReviewID": "R24UAD8RB0E2PA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good little WIN7 machine for basic programs and small gaming applications.  Wifi and mouse setup was a breeze, and it even was able to connect to my wireless printer (which my other slightly older but more powerful HP laptop was unable to do).  There are lots of pop-ups with the pre-installed Bloat-ware from HP and require a careful eye on what you allow or not.  It came with a 60-day free trial of Norton Anti-virus, but we didn't need that so it was uninstalled.Sound is very good with speakers coming from a silver panel on the front above the keyboard, good treble and bass pickups.  It has a 10-key number panel on the side, something we needed.  Keyboard is nice and quiet and is not crowded.  Battery life is average, getting 3-4 hours on it's own and takes an hour or two to fully recharge.It's relativly lightweight and easy to move around the house.One MAJOR con is the malwar and virus's found.  Yes, I said virus's.  After downloading a bunch of WIN7 and system updates and installing, I then downloaded AVG Virus Scanner, Spybot, and AdAware.  Three programs I consider essential to a safe computer, I downloaded them, updated them all, then ran them all.  The virus scan found 4 virus's with names associated to malwar games - instant delete.

If you want to get into some decent gaming, this MIGHT be the laptop for you but it probably wont. Its graphics aren't that great, like you guys have said the shift button is pretty awful. I dont plan on buying a laptop again, for a while at least, because it did what i wanted it to when i got it but now that im REALLY getting into computers I'm rather disappointed. It does have some nice features but once again, if your gonna game this isn't the computer for you.

I have had two dv-4 laptops (slightly older model than dv-6) that have died due to similar problems, after less than two years.

The computers were bought for Christmas, 2009, less than two years ago. I can't speak for current DELL quality, but I have a 6-year old Inspiron laptop that's still working fine, and a 7-year-old Latitude that is also still plugging along -- so HP has no excuse for such dismal performance.
