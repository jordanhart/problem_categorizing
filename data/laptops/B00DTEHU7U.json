I'm upgrading from another Satellite laptop that used a dual core i3 processor (which was rated as 2.10 GHz), and this dual core i5 (rated at 1.8 GHz) is pretty fast. I ran a Webroot scan, did a disk clean up and defrag, copied my music files to a 1.0 USB flash drive (I have a ton of music it took about 15 mins), opened a few word docs, opened my iTunes and played it, and on top of all that I opened 12 Chrome tabs and clicked play on all the videos (understand this utilizes your internet and memory more than your processor). While I did all this I opened the CPU performance manager and watched the processor kick up to 2.65 GHz. The CPU got warm but never hot. I'm very happy with the processor performance so far.While all this was happening, only 3.5 of the 6 gigs of memory were being utilized. So I KNOW I won't need to upgrade the memory (you are able to upgrade to 16 gigs of RAM).Windows 8 was a pain in the ass when I first started using it. I've grown to like it and I think of it as Windows 7 with a different start button with the ability to download apps.On top of everything the computer looks sexy as heck.Complaints: The backlit keyboard only offers you one brightness option.Also, as with my other Satellite laptop, sometimes (on rare occations so far) this computer does not detect Wifi signals. I accidentally put the computer in \"Airplane Mode\" and when I turned Airplane Mode back off, the laptop was unable to find any Wifi signals. I figured out how to fix my last Satellite by turning off the laptop, removing the battery, then turning the laptop back on. Since there is no battery on this one you have to go into Device Manager..go to Network Adapters...find Intel(R) Centrino(R) Wireless-N 2230...right click to uninstall this (IMPORTANT: do NOT check the \"Remove drivers\" option)...wait for it to uninstall then right click on any of the other adapters in the drop down...right click then click \"Scan for hardware changes\"...the Intel(R) Centrino(R) Wireless-N 2230 should show back up and your Wifi radio switch should be turned back on and it will then detect wifi. You may never have to deal with this issue and its not enough for me to take away a full star so I'm sticking with 5 stars.", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great laptop", "Author": "Shivani Ramsaran", "ReviewID": "R245GJ5S14U6RP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it's light, sleek, simple to use (as toshiba usually is), great screen display at the 15.6\" sizeWould have liked if speakers were louder (but that is minor)I have no problems thus far..Would recommend this laptop to anyone", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "No Manual, No removable battery, No replaceable hard drive", "Author": "Anterjot Singh", "ReviewID": "R1HSDPEWJS6YE0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Laptop has no dedicated manual.

If fact, sadly, I'm writing my review on my old clunky computer.  The \"Quick Start\" instructions were skimpy, skimpy, skimpy. The problem is Windows 8 is like a foreign language. I had to buy a $35 book to explain it.The \"Charms\" weren't so charming until I figured out how to stabilize them. My email is not up and running due to the fact that Windows 8 does not support a POP connection. I'm still trying to figure out how to do an end run around that. (Part of that problem is the only internet service available to me in the boondocks where I live is horse and buggy). Windows 8 is very visual which I love and once I learn the \"language\" I think this will be fun; but its not \"plug and play\". As far as the hardware, love the design, the great keyboard and the large speakers. I'll have to wait to test the rest, like web cam, speed, etc.Wish me luck, thank God for U tube tutorials.", "Date": "September 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP", "Author": "ricardo", "ReviewID": "R2CZNAOD2NYI3L", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP, when I checked the hard drive looking for the 750gb, low and behold it only had a total of 685gb and only 649gb was free. do not buy this...Toshiba nor best buy are  willing to rectify this problem.
