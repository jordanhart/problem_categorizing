After having a terrible experience with laptops (bought two acers, both broke within 6 months and acer didn't even bother helping me) this laptop gave me hope. The RAM is just right with 4gb and a 2.30 gh processor this machine is so fast. Its been working great for me, and is good for traveling. I am a DJ and use my laptop for music and it worked great at my first gig a couple weeks ago. I also use it for my personal use and I like my computers super fast. This is perfect. Also Dell is a great company with excellent support. I would recommend this computer to anyone weather it be for personal or business use. Also never buy from Acer I amazed that their even allowed to stay in business with the crap they sell.P.S. I didn't buy my Dell at amazon I bought it at BestBuy.", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect Machine", "Author": "saini", "ReviewID": "R2X0HSNH0K9NZB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Dell Inspiron i15N-2591BK Laptop with Intel Core-i3 2330M 2.20GHz. is very Rich Featured Powerful Machine for Every-Day Computing.
