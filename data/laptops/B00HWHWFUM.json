Extremely thin and light. Very silent, even during hard jobs.It comes with Windows 7, which is a bonus for me (not really interested in W8), and it does not have a touchscreen, which makes it a bit cheaper.The only weak point is the keyboard, looks a bit fragile, feels \"cheap\". Other than that one really has the impression that this is a really high-end laptop.It includes a dongle for RJ45 port (ethernet), so you don't have to worry about it.It does NOT include the dongle for VGA, nor HDMI (although it has a Mini HDMI port). You may want to consider purchasing those.", "Date": "June 3, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,699.99", "Features": "Ativ Book 9 - Intel Core I7-4500U - 256Gb Ssd - 8Gb Ddr3 - 13.3 Led - Intel Hd G", "Name": "ATIV Book 9 NP900X3G 13.3\" LED (SuperBright) Ultrabook - Intel Core i7 i7-4500U 1.80 GHz - Ash Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31KIWQQBkML._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00HWHWFUM"}}
