{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Some key points for now..", "Author": "ArmyguyNCali", "ReviewID": "R3261EK2OY9RIS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A few posters above have given the meaty basics on this thing so far so I won't go into all of those again.  I will provide some of the technical features of this device.I will add to this review as I figure things out a little more.  But I figured that I would post this here for now.  I just purchased this from a Microsoft store as well.  No Samsung apps on it as TechNurse said.  It is also very top heavy and will fall over if not on a hard flat surface.  Here are a few key points that I have noticed.There are four different models of the 700T1C which end in A01, A02, A03, and A04.  I reviewed the Samsung site and found all specifications for each one.  I can tell you I don't even think Samsung knows what these things have since they are so new.  I did my research and found right off the bat that Samsung's specs are wrong on this model.  I have the XE700T1C-AE02US.Samsung's website states it as having a 32bit version of Windows 8.  This is incorrect.  It has a full 64bit version of Windows 8.Another thing I found right away is that Samsung lists this model(A02) as only having a 1.5ghz processor which is also incorrect.  It has a 1.7ghz processor just like the rest of them.It shows the A03 and A04 as having a TPM security chip, and the A01 and A02 as not having this chip.  I don't know if they just have them disabled for a reason or if they think people don't know what they do.  I was able to activate mine on my A02.  You have to go into the BIOS and enable it.  You cannot do this from the desktop, etc.  Once it is enabled via BIOS, then you install and configure it via the desktop.  So here is one more thing that it doesn't list, but it does have it.The other main difference in the A04 model is that it comes standard with Windows 8 Pro whereas the other 3 do not.  It also looks like it comes with some type of Office as well for the $150 price difference.There is only one other thing that I found that the A02 does not list which the other 3 do.  That is having the built in WiDi.  I started researching that and it is basically from transmitting Wireless Display to a capable TV set and a few other products.  It is made by Intel.  It seems to me like it is more of a software download than hardware but I could be wrong.  I need to check on that as well.Ok so another question I see a lot of is the 3G/4G capabilities.  I don't know if there is some kind of adapter needed to get the SIM cards to fit, but I tried both a Verizon and an At&T; SIM card both out of cell phones.  They were both way too small to fit in the slot and they just fell right in.  I was thinking that there might be an adapter or maybe the SIM cards for tablets are different sized.  Either way I will try to see what I can find out.One thing I do not understand is why they would have four different models that are pretty much the same thing, and three of them are the same price.  The A04 is the only one that seems to be more expensive, but is also the only one that comes with Windows 8 Pro.Heat: So far I have not had this thing get very warm at all.  I never hear the fan kick on either.  I have not ran it too hard but plan on watching some Netflix and stuff over the weekend and will see how it goes then.Battery life:  I have ran this thing watching youtube videos, surfing the web, and downloading stuff.  The battery lasted 6 hours before needing recharged.  As stated, these things do not have a battery in the keyboard so what is in the tablet is all you get.Keyboard:  Seems a little cramped but gets the job done.  No backlighting which is unfortunate.  Not too bulky which works out fine.  I think the overall thickness of the tablet and keyboard together is a lot thicker than many ultra books as well as heavier.One last thing to note is that upon opening and looking at the instruction manual,  the front of it said that it was for the 700T/701T models.  There is no 701T models out yet so maybe this could be either the 256gb hard drive version with the I7 processor...who knows???Problems so far:  I am not sure why but I have had this thing freeze up a few times now where I have had to restart it to get it back to where it will run again.  Very irritating to say the least.  Not sure what is causing it but I will probably be reformating it anyways with Windows Pro here in the next few days.Any questions feel free to ask and I will try to answer them for you.Update:***How to turn on TPM module***Since there have been a few people that can't figure it out, I will give a step by step on how to do it.  I take no responsibility with anything you choose to do in the BIOS.  Changing things around can mess up your computer if you don't know what you are doing.  If you choose to continue, that is completely on you and you are doing so at your own risk.1. Go to \"Settings\" tab.  It is the little gear shaped icon in the side menu.2. Click on \"change PC settings\" which is right underneath the keyboard symbol.3.  This will take you to a screen that says \"PC settings\".  Click on the \"General\" tab.4.  Scroll down on the right side of the screen until you see an option that says \"Advanced Startup\".  It is at the very bottom.  Underneath this option there is a box that says \"Restart Now\".  Click this box.5.The system will restart and a blue screen will appear.  It will say \"Choose an option\" at the top and give you three boxes to chose from.  You want to pick the middle one, or the one that says \"Troubleshoot\".6.  It will then give you 3 more boxes to choose from.  You want to click the bottom one, or the one that says \"Advanced options\".7.  It will now take you to another screen that has 6 boxes to chose from.  You want to click on the box that says \"UEFI Firmware settings\".8. It will now say \"Restart to change UEFI firmware settings\".  Click the little box that says \"restart\".9.  The computer will now restart and take you to the Samsung BIOS configuration.  It will give you 5 colored boxes on the left side of the screen.  You want to click the box that says \"Security\".  It is an aqua colored box.  It will give you the security options on the right side of the screen.10.  You will see at the bottom an option that says \"TPM Configuration\".  Click on this option.11. It will now say \"TPM Device\" and have a little box to the right of it that says \"Disabled\".  This is a drop down box.  Click on it and click on the \"Enabled\" option.12.  It will now give you another option called \"TPM State\" with another drop down box.  Click on this and select the option that says \"Enable and Activate\".13. Now click on the \"Save\" tab on the right side.  It will pop up a white box that says \"Save and Reset\".  Click on the box that says \"Yes\".14.  Your computer will restart and take you back to the login screen.  TPM is now enabled.  You now have to go to your desktop screen.  You will see the TPM icon in the right hand side of the toolbar, next to the clock.  You have to click on that and go through the settings to initialize it.That is it.  If you don't know how to do it from there, you probably shouldn't be messing with any of it in the first place.  Take it to a computer place that knows what they are doing and they can help you further.  Good Luck.", "Date": "November 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Elusive Samsung Ativ PC Pro 700t", "Author": "L. Breda \"L.\"", "ReviewID": "R2NGKR1VS1JQ8G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I chatted with Microsoft via there online chat support, and I called my local store November 12th and nobody had any idea when they might be getting the 700T in stock. I had read that people were getting them at their local Microsoft stores from the Q&A; section on Amazon discussions as well as from a few other forums. Apparently this tablet has a pretty large (and frustrated) following.I myself was just about to throw in the towel and think about maybe going with the Sony Duo Slider or buying a series 7 slate and downloading windows 8 to make it more usable. I really want the  active digitizer and the only reason why I didn't jump on the Sony Duo was because its Digitizer is the inferior N-Trig.Today on a whim I called my local Microsoft again and held my breath as the store clerk went to check to see if they had the 700T in stock. When they guy got back on the line and informed that YES THEY DID HAVE IT IN STOCK I almost keeled over!!!! After all this waiting I could finally get my hands on the elusive Samsung Ativ PC Pro! I asked the store clerk if I should RUN over because seeing how they are selling out like hot cakes online I figured they must be in store as well! He didn't seem to think they would sell out before the afternoon, but let me tell you I got in the car and booked it over there anyways!I wrote a quick review earlier but it was pretty useless so I am rewriting my review to see if I can more effectively give people some insights on this wonderful tablet. Here are my first impressions -Build Quality - I had read online that some people felt the build quality of the Ativ 700T was cheap. I disagree; while it is made of plastic I think it feels quite nice in my hands. I previously purchased a Series 7 slate and returned it because I disliked how wide it was and now I remember why I disliked it! in landscape mode the tablet is wonderful! But turn it to portrait and its pretty long and awkward to hold. However, since I use my ipad for reading and web surfing and I plan to use this for digital art and light photo editing I think the width will end up working in my favor. I also think that the design is improved over the series 7 slate. There is now a slot for the S-pen which is much more practical (though it also has caused major design changes for the s-pen over the pen that came with series 7 which I will talk about later) and its seems slimmer and lighter though I haven't actually compared the specs. I also like the black  color I think it looks more professional and less like a toy.S-Pen - As I mentioned above in order for the S-pen to fit into the unit Samsung has changed it significantly from the stylus that came with the series 7 slate. I liked the build quality of the series 7 stylus but it was useless to me if I couldn't keep it house in the unit. I think for long periods of writing I will see if the stylus from my intuos 6 tablet will work with the 700t. For my smaller hands I don't think I will experience too much discomfort while writing or drawing with the tiny stylus but for a man with large hands I think it would be uncomfortable quickly.The S-pen works great in the s-note ap! No lag and shows nice pressure sensitivity. However, I don't really think the s-not ap is that practical for storing all my drawings and prefer more mainstream ap's like one note and Corel Painter. So far I downloaded Corel Painter and did some quick sketches and the S-pen worked pretty good! I am not noticing very good pressure sensitivity I think its there but it is not as responsive as in S-note. I am going to try out art rage and some other programs and also experiment more with Corel and hopefully get some better results. However, the performance of Corel Painter was really good and I am very satisfied. I downloaded the one note ap in the microsoft store (free version) its not full one-note its and ap version of one-note -  its not great - performance wise there is no lag but its hard to navigate and I think the full version will be better and more familiar. However, I can't really complain when something is free.Performance wise I am pretty happy! The microsoft guy showed me computers with the same specs so that I could see just how impressive the internals are of this device crammed into such a slim shell. It is responsive and snappy and the tile mode is SO BEAUTIFUL and easy.I got the version XE700T1C-A02US version which is supposed to be 32 bit  - but it ended up being 64bit -  nobody seems to know what is what with these models. The store clerk informed me there was no keyboard with this model  -  well when I opened it much to my surprise there WAS A keyboard included! I think Samsung has some clarification to do on their models!So the keyboard was my one point of disappointment - I couldn't snap it on when I tried and then I realized that there was two little plus in the holes -  I felt like an idiot and was glad I didn't rush back to the store to complain I had gotten a faulty item (Though I am not sure the microsoft  store people even know enough about this product to know these plugs exist and might have thought there was a problem with the item as well) I didn't like the keyboard because for some reason it feels cheap to me. It's so light compared to the tablet it seems really unnatural and when its up and running it looks like I am working on a computer with the keyboard side up. I bet the 500t looks way sexier with its keyboard attached. I do think its an extremely practical design (I like it way better than the surface snap on covers with the stand in the back of the tablet, and way better than the series 7 keyboard solution with its individual dock and keyboard. My biggest gripe is it does not allow you to tilt it back far enough so when you use it on your lap its a bit to forward to be comfortable. I think maybe one more generation of keyboard docks and Samsung will get it right. However, I have to say the keyboard is cool and practical and makes the tablet a complete laptop replacement for users who need to do allot of typing. The track-pad is pretty slippery I really dislike it, but I overall I love that this thing can be used with a keyboard so nicely.Battery, I have not used it long enough to clearly asses the Battery. On the series 7 I got horrible battery life I think I see some improvement on the Ativ. I think the solution here is to just get a portable battery pack. I loved the 500t's longevity but I would rather sacrifice battery life for improved performance in my favorite programs.Overall I think this tablet is great! I think if you don't use intensive programs but you want the wacom digitizer for writing go with the 500t. I think if you only plan on having ONE tablet go with the 500t (I can't imagine doing my daily new york times reading on the couch with the honker of a tablet in my hand) Honestly, If it is for surfing, email, kindle etc... I would still go ipad... but if you want productivity this is the only tablet to go with!I hope I have helped some people out with my story and I am always happy to answer any questions I can! I will also try to post some updates as I use the Ativ 700T more.Update* I'm changing my rating down to four stars it is a great tablet but I have had some problems with force quit and crashes while doing corel with multiple layers also noticed some lag. I also HATE THE KEYBOARD and believe it has some unforgivable flaws. Overall this is still a good tablet especially if money isn't and issue. It is amazing to run programs in something this compact. I am returning mine, mostly because I think that tablets coming out in 2013 with Haswell will suit my needs better.", "Date": "November 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great tablet, terrible keyboard design.", "Author": "Tech Nurse \"Tech Nurse\"", "ReviewID": "R2SYU9LW72AKN1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "UPDATE:I've made the hard decision to return this item.  I use my laptop 70% of the time, tablet functions 30%.  I can't justify the cost on a product half baked.  Between some win 8 bugs and the issues already documented below, I've opted to update to a ultrabook laptop.  HP Elitebook Folio 9470m which you can read my review here: http://www.amazon.com/HP-EliteBook-Folio-180GB-Notebook/dp/B009PHUR66/ref=cm_aya_orig_subjIn 6 months, there will be better devices, hopefully one that addresses the shortcomings of this device.  By then Win 8 patches should be in place and more sites will address IE 10 compatabilities.  Even Amazon's site struggles with IE 10.Hopefully the Elitebook Folio will have a touchscreen and stylus option with a tablet option by then.I find that I need to work via laptop 6-10 hrs a day and then I want to relax and use the tablet functions, but with battery limitations with this device, you don't have this option.  So when I actually want to use the tablet, the battery is already drained from the day use, unless I was plugging it in everytime I returned to my desk which sometimes is not an option.So for now, I'll continue to use a laptop and switch to a tablet as needed.  As a tablet, this product is awesome.  The question you have to ask is, $1,200 awesome?  For me, not right now.UPDATE:You can read my updates below, but I put this on the very top.  I have to echo the review by Isaac related to the keyboard.  I've mentioned the issues below, but the price for just the tablet doesn't justify not having a functioning keyboard.  The top heaviness and the lack of being able tilt the tablet further back and that it's just a basic keyboard without much more to add to the tablet functioning, I've dropped my original 4 star rating to 3 as this combo just fails as a combo.  As a tablet, wins hands down, but I didn't spend this much money for just a tablet.  Samsung sells the keyboard alone for $130 which is ridiculous since it has little to offer that another external keyboard couldn't offer. I'm hoping Asus comes out with a pen input device as they already nailed the keyboard design with the SD card, extra battery.  The only missing item would be extra storage option.For those looking at tablets with pen options, here's a link that compares the tablets: [...]Previous Review:Fortunate to have a Microsoft store near me and they had just received a shipment, hadn't even had time to put it on display.They do not charge a restocking fee and they are in their holiday timeline, so I have until Jan 14 to decide whether to keep or return.  Just to make sure, I had them write this on my receipt.Ok, not that any of the above really helps in the review, but in the event you have one of these Microsoft stores nearby, it may be an option, especially since Amazon seems to still be sold out.I have an asus transformer 1st gen, kindle fire, ipad 1 & 2, I use a Toshiba R835 Ultrabook for most of my day to day computer work.I'm looking for something that can replace essentially the need to carry a tablet and a laptop and can handle windows software for business.I will update this review as needed.  I'm not going to repeat the typical reviews on specs, etc.  There's plenty out there, this will be on a more simplified level, from an end user perspective.INITIAL FIRST IMPRESSIONS:Tablet is big.  As a computer it's almost too small, but it's a compromise.  Weight as a tablet felt heavy, but not as heavy as my first gen asus transformer, but I'm use to carrying the ipad 2, weight as a laptop feels fine.  Nice and compact, although a bit on the thick side, but a nice smooth profile.Cons: No backlit keyboard, touch pad is narrow, no full size SD card, no VGA port (I hate carrying dongles and adapters).  Wish the keyboard had an extra battery and storage, ie. another hard drive, this would help weight down the keyboard.  The keyboard base is light, making it top heavy.  Wish they used USB 3 ports in the keyboard base instead of USB 2.  And it would of been nice if the ports were together so you could use an external DVD drive (which requires 2 usb ports typically).There's a large learning curve, mainly due to the new OS.  What doesn't help is, no manual.  It comes with a vague quick start guide.  I'm still trying to figure out how to turn the blue tooth on and NFR.  I'm sure there's a pdf, just have to find it.I did load a 64 GB micro sd card and the system recognized it without problems.  The power adapter is nice and compact, about half the bulk as my Toshiba R835 which was light to begin with.Even though it comes with a 128 GB hard drive, you actually have 78 GB of 101 GB available, so space will be tight.Before you dock the tablet to the keyboard, you have to remove 2 plastic tabs which I ended up having to use a knife to pry them up and out they were very tight fitting.Also they don't plaster stupid stickers all over the device (Except for 2 on the back side of the tablet.  No bloatware which is something Microsoft stores pride themselves on.Anyway, I know this is not much to go on, but I'll update this the more I start using it in real world work, once I load my programs and get use to the navigation.  Hope this helps.ADDITIONAL UPDATES:Took about an hour for the battery to charge to 100%.  I've now been using it for almost 3 hours and the meter still says about 3 hours left.  The screen resolution is fantastic.I haven't really stressed this computer out yet.  Mainly just learning how to navigate windows 8.  I did come across setting up my blue tooth and I have it paired with my Samsung S3, no really I'm not a Samsung employee, but it's one of the few that offered a pen input solution along with the other added benefits.I did come across an option to have the fan run automatically, at reduced speed, or not at all.  It's default is off, so I changed it to auto.So far, the unit's remained cool, but again haven't stressed it with lots of videos or intensive applications.Viewing angles are definitely better than my Toshiba R835.  The stylus is short, about 2/3 size of a normal pen and it's very narrow.  It's housed in the tablet and it's a very snug fit.  I'm sure it'll loosen over tine, but if I had nails, they'd be breaking trying to get it out.Also one thing to note is the screen when docked with the keyboard doesn't tilt all the way back.  I'm finding myself wanting to tilt the screen back just a bit further, but that's just me.  Probably done this way to prevent the unit from falling over, referencing the top heavy design.More Updates:The Box I have says OB 4 GB Ram which to me means On Board RAM.  The hard Drive says 128 SSD 4mm, which I'm guessing means it's part of the mother board also, since most SSD footprint are the typical 7-9 mm in height.  I see no means of removing the back without damaging the plastic.  I wish I could upgrade the storage and RAM.  Samsung really missed an opportunity not having extra storage in the keyboard, no backlit keyboard, no full SD card slot and no extra battery.  If they had done all of that, there would be very little reason not to like this completely.  It would also address the top heaviness.  If this had a battery on the bottom with twice the capacity of the tablet portion and it could charge the tablet, I would definitely take the added weight for that additional run time.As far as the camera appears to be 2 MP on the front and 5MP on the back based on running the camera app and they have a size selection and the back only went up to 5MP.The Samsung apps are found in the apps store.  Tap on the store tile, scroll to the Samsung picks.  All the aps are listed right there.  Somehow I totally missed these the first time because I checked there first since I figured it made sense.  Samsung must of added them between the first time I looked and after my factory restore.I'm not too impressed with the Samsung apps, they appear to be just the overgrown version of what you see with the Samsung S3 android apps.  I ended up downloading the free MS one note.BTW, I tried one notes, handwrote a bunch of stuff, lassoed it and was able to move the items with very little lag.  Yes, there was a slight one, but nothing that wasn't usable.I like that the device has a palm detection so when it senses the pen, you can rest your palm on the screen.  That may be more the software, but it's worked with one note and S note.I'm really not liking this keyboard, feels cramped and trying to hold the unit by the keyboard is not comfortable as all the weight is on the top so it places a strain on your wrist when carrying or holding.  You'll probably find yourself holding the top which to me seems awkward as I don't do this with a laptop.I'm having work load Windows 8 Enterprise as my work requires the Pro edition of Windows 8.  That's more related to my work, not the device, but once they do this, they'll load the MS office and I can start loading additional software.  So far, I've been using it more for typical tablet use, which I definitely am enjoying.  I'm seriously thinking of just getting a Bluetooth keyboard.Also this device is abnormally long in length, making it long and narrow (bigger than a pad of notebook paper, yet narrower than a typical pad).  Which means at meetings, it looks a bit odd.  I have to look for a business folio that I can place this in, unfortunately I don't think many folios will be accommodate something this tall.  I'll let you know if I find one.  I would of preferred one that was the same size as a pad of paper.  Could of used the height to even the look and that would of given the touch pad some added room too in the height department.Also, Samsung has included a Samsung utility called quick starter that includes the start menu, so if you get really stuck, this will help.Of course if you've made it this far in this review, I'm impressed as I know this is getting long, but hopefully this is helping.As soon as I get Win 8 Pro loaded and MS Office loaded, I'll really be able to provide run time in real world usage.  So far just browsing and basic tasks, the fan doesn't kick on and I'm getting roughly 6-6.5 hours.  I did watch about 45 minutes of you tube videos, which the fan did kick in and the top felt slightly warm, but nothing like my laptop.  It was barely noticeable to the touch and I had to hold my ear to the vent to even detect the fan was running.*** I just loaded a few pics ***Update: The 3G/4G slot next to the micro SD card slot is an empty shell.  I'm guessing there's no antenna as there is definitely not a card slot, if you try to place your sim card, it will just fall into an empty space and good luck trying to retrieve it.  Explains why the slot isn't marked.  Little disappointed as I took optional as if I went to a cell carrier and asked for a sim card and an account, I'd just be able to put the sim card in and I'm good to go.  A bit misleading.  For me, it's not that big of a deal as my cell phone on 4 LTE has the capacity to be a hot spot for no extra charge.Also, the hinge for the keyboard appears to be loosening up a bit too much in which the tablet will move by itself once it passes a certain point.  I'm thinking that I'd prefer a backlit Bluetooth keyboard built into a portfolio tablet case.  At least I have until Jan to see what else comes out.  Perhaps Samsung will create another optional keyboard base with all the missing features that were mentioned above.  Ok, one can be wishful.Other issue noted is attempting to upgrade to Windows Pro and having difficulty having the tablet boot via a usb.  Changed the bios boot order, but so far it's not booting from the USB device with the wind 8 Pro install files.  I'll update this when it's successful.", "Date": "November 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Exceeds Expectations", "Author": "TraderGary", "ReviewID": "R3B4XWOCWEJ9KB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased my Samsung ATIV Smart PC Pro 700T at the Microsoft store in Atlanta, GA on Tuesday November 13.  I cancelled my two week old order with Amazon.  The Microsoft Store had it first.  Sorry, Amazon.The plus with buying at the Microsoft store was getting their Microsoft Assurance insurance policy.  I'm fully protected for anything except loss or theft.  I can drop it or spill liquid and I'm covered.  In addition I get 3 years of phone or in-store Microsoft Support.  For me getting the insurance/support policy was a no-brainer.  I'm covered no matter what for $329 for 3 years.After a week of use, I'm more than pleased.  The IPS screen is absolutely stunning at 1920 x 1080 with no discernible pixilation and with over 400 nits of brightness the only screen that currently compares is the iPad 4.  The keyboard has a great feel and won't drain the battery as there is no back lighting.  I touch type and have no need for a backlit keyboard as I never look at it anyway.  I strongly disagree with the reviewer who said the keyboard was flimsy and cheap.  On the contrary, I was impressed with its high quality and light weight.  There are all degrees of quality in plastics, all the way from cheap toys to high grade ABS plastics used by NASA.  Too bad there is such a negative connotation to the word \"plastic\".  Samsung uses a very high grade as after a week of heavy use carrying it everywhere I go; there is not a mark or scratch anywhere.  The entire unit has a very high quality feel.Don't make the mistake of thinking you are buying a laptop.  This is a very high grade \"tablet\" PC with a great keyboard dock.  If you want a laptop, then buy an ultra-book.  However, if you want a powerful tablet with full PC capabilities that will totally blow away any Android tablet or iPad, then this is your baby.  (I own a quality Android tablet and there are several iPad's in the family, so I do have a basis of comparison.)The Samsung ATIV Smart PC Pro 700T has a Wacom pen.  The pen stores in the lower right corner when looking at the screen and is very handy to get to when needed.  There is a huge difference between an ordinary pen option for just writing and marking and Samsung's Wacom pen with 1,028 degrees of pressure sensitivity.  A Wacom pen is an artist's tool.  I use mine mostly with Photoshop CS6 for photo retouching and it has completely replaced my old external Wacom pen and tablet combo.  It's a real pleasure to now be able to do my photo retouching directly on my screen.  When using the tablet without the keyboard dock and mouse pad, the pen can also literally replace the functionality of a mouse.Several reviewers were dismayed that when attached to the lighter weight keyboard, the combination is top heavy.  Of course it is.  It's a 1.8 pound tablet (that is only 6 ounces heavier than an iPad) and can be attached to a light weight keyboard dock. The electronics and weight are all in the tablet and not in the keyboard base.I have no problems when docked to the keyboard.  If one roughly rocks the tablet in the keyboard dock, I suppose you could cause the connection to make and break.I have installed Photoshop CS6 and my Interactive Brokers stock trading platform.  All my data files and pictures are stored on my Microsoft SkyDrive with a backup on a local 3 Terabyte Western Digital Live drive attached to my NetGear R6300 router.  The SkyDrive and the Western Digital Live can be accessed when home on my internal network and when I'm away from home on the Internet.  I was initially concerned that the 128 GB SSD would not be enough.  Now that I've added SkyDrive and my 3 Terabytes of local network storage, the 128 GB SSD is more than adequate.The bottom line: I wanted a tablet that had all the power of a desktop in tablet form.  This is the fastest and most useful computer l have ever owned. I love it.  For me Samsung got it right.  If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.Addendum:Several reviewers have said their units have defective connections between the tablet and keyboard dock. My tablet makes the chime sound when it first connects to the dock, but after it snaps in to place I can attempt to rock it fairly roughly and it will not break the connection. My connection between tablet and keyboard dock is definitely not defective and is very solid.I've been frequently using it as a laptop in my lap and experience no problems. The connection never breaks and remains solid.  I find after 10 days of using it, my division of use between tablet and laptop is about 50/50.I have 3 days left on my 14 day return period at the Microsoft Store in Atlanta.  As of right now I'm quite satisfied with mine and have no intention of returning it.Addendum 2:It's Dec 13th and I've had my Samsung ATIV Smart PC Pro 700T for exactly one month.  Reading the reviews following mine with the number of 1, 2 and 3 stars, it makes me wonder if we're reviewing the same unit.  One of the biggest negatives I read in the reviews is keyboard problems. Mine has no problems with the keyboard whatsoever, and in fact I really like it. When I got mine the first thing I did before anything else was do my Microsoft system updates and in particular I ran Samsung's \"SW-Update\" to update all of Samsung's hardware drivers.  I have to wonder if having done that eliminated many of the problems I see other reviewers having.My pen is accurate everywhere and I love using it.  When using my unit as a tablet, the pen functions beautifully as a mouse and makes the tablet an absolute delight to use as I've got pin-point accuracy and non of the problems of fat-fingering a touch screen. I have no problems using the supplied pen and having it always available in its slot on the back of the unit as amazingly handy.  In tablet mode I go to it all the time.I purchased a Logitech Blue Tooth laptop mouse and use it all the time in laptop mode when on my desk.  It works very well.  Highly recommended.I had a lot of trepidation with what I though would be a very small 128 Gb SSD drive, but adding 100 Gb of storage to my SkyDrive gives me all I currently need for a $50 annual cost and I can always add more if/when needed.  I also have a large NAS drive attached to my NetGear R6300 router that duplicates what I have on my SkyDrive, so I have all my irreplaceable files and pictures stored locally as well as off-site.  My pictures and data are very secure and I'll never lose anything.  A month later I still have 74 Gb free on my Samsung 128 Gb SSD drive.I've owned dozens of PC's since my first IBM PC in 1982.  This is the best and most useful PC I've ever owned by a very wide margin.Addendum 3:I've now had my 700T for over two months.Everything still works just as before.I have zero problems with my keyboard, it works perfectly.The 128Gb size of the SSD is absolutely no problem with Microsoft SkyDrive and my large NAS drive on my router.My Wacom S-Pen works perfectly and is highly accurate.The speed and power of this computer is amazing.My old desktop and old laptop sit unused.This computer has exceeded all my expectations in every way.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Real PC in a tablet with a Wacom stylus", "Author": "Tamas Demjen", "ReviewID": "R8ZO7XJ7P210N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Here are my initial impressions after a day of use.Pros:- Wacom digitizer technology- Real computer in a tablet form factor- Can run Photoshop without getting too hot- Better display and higher resolution than a 12.1\" CintiqCons:- Not quite the same features as a professional Wacom that artists use- No programmable physical buttons, like Ctrl/Alt (but you can buy a bluetooth keyboard)- Crippled stylus (but you can use an alternative Wacom stylus)[edit: Previously I said any Wacom stylus, which may be incorrect. My Fujitsu stylus works with the ATIV, but the Intuos stylus may not.]- Wide screen format is impractical for note taking (either too narrow, or not tall enough)- Tips over extremely easily in laptop configuration- Keyboard only works when physically attachedMake no mistake, the Samsung ATIV 700T is not your average toy for browsing and reading books. It is a real Tablet PC with an Intel i5 processor, running the full desktop version of Windows 8, which means you can run Photoshop, Illustrator, OneNote, and Visual Studio. As an engineer and photographer, I have used a Tablet PC since 2007. My old one was large, heavy, slow, running extremely hot, even when idling, and the battery life was dismal. I'm happy to report that this Samsung has none of those issues at all.The device's outer shell is made of plastic, but it is very solid. There is no flex, and the dock connection is surprisingly rigid. The main issue with the laptop configuration is that it's unusually top heavy, which means it easily tips over and falls on the ground. The keyboard portion has no battery, and unfortunately it does not function at all unless the machine is attached to it. That means I have to use a different external bluetooth keyboard, because I don't care for the laptop configuration. Otherwise the keyboard would be quite usable, if it was bluetooth. The touch pad is multi-touch, the whole touch area works like a single mouse button. It isn't as smooth as a MacBook's glass pad, but still functional. Of course touching the LCD is vastly superior.I have not experienced any heating issues so far. It does not really get hot, not even when running Photoshop. The built-in fan is pretty quiet, barely audible from a working distance. If you put your ear close to the vent, you will hear it, but not when it's on my desk. It's heavier than your average toy tablet, but only slightly so. I can hold it comfortably in my hand. It's not going to burn you at all.Windows 8 needs some getting used to, but I've had no big problems. I haven't tried to install OS X on it, I'm not sure if it's possible, but I really like Microsoft OneNote anyway, and Windows has pretty good touch support and handwriting recognition. It is surprisingly easy to operate with a finger, even without a physical keyboard. You need a physical keyboard for certain things, such as using Photoshop (for the shift, alt, control keys). If you touch the screen with 3 fingers, a toolbar will pop up with buttons like undo, copy and paste. The orientation can be automatic, or locked to either landscape or portrait.Of course you do not buy this computer for the touch screen, you get it for the Wacom digitizer. What Samsung calls S-Pen is really Wacom technology, with a pressure-sensitive pen. The included stylus is small and comes with a soft tip, so it feels like writing on glass. I would say it's too basic, with only one button that is difficult to operate, and no eraser. However, you could use any Wacom stylus -- my Fujitsu one works, only it has a harder tip, so you might want to use a screen protector in that case. The pen is super precise, it has many times the resolution of the display. You can write really tiny letters with a super thin line in OneNote. It's not your capacitive iPad stylus for sure. The included Samsung app isn't nearly as good, it's raster-graphics, like a JPEG; OneNote is vector-based.When you put the pen close to the display, the touch sensor turns off, so you can rest your palm comfortably. This requires a little getting used to, because as soon as you lift the pen too much, your palm can register a touch. I'm using OneNote, where a touch is registered as a scroll. In other apps you could accidentally ink something just by touching the screen, which is very frustrating. You should get into the habit of hovering the pen while resting your palm, or turn off the touch feature, which isn't easy to do (you can't just quickly switch it on and off). I'll try to write a small app for turning the touch sensor on and off and pin it on the task bar. If I can figure out how to do it, I'll let you all know. I would have preferred if Samsung had included a quick switch.The display is wide, bright and sharp. It is a glossy one, so you can see plenty of reflection in bad lighting. However, even a matte LCD reflects the overhead lights, this is a common problem with tablets. The resolution is amazing, 1920x1080 at 11.6 inches. It is not quite an Apple retina display yet, but for all intents and purposes, individual pixels are not noticeable, and you get a good sized working area. The retina iPad still has the edge for reading books and magazines.The device comes with some pre-installed junk, although many of the apps are useful, and you can uninstall what you don't need. Sadly an Office OneNote license is not included for free. Evernote and Skype are there. After installing Microsoft Office and Adobe Photoshop, I still have 70 GB of free space, plus you can add a Micro SD card for extended storage.I think this is an excellent tool for those who need it, albeit a highly specialized one. Apple could make a better device, but they won't, and the cost of the ModBook is astronomical. The reason I bought the ATIV is the combination of the Wacom and the real desktop OS in a near-tablet form factor.I'm not sure how good it is for a real artist, since it is not quite the same as a Wacom Cintiq or an Intuos. You don't get the same pressure sensitivity, the angle and orientation sensing. If you normally use Photoshop on a Mac, it's awkward to have Windows as a second device, and Adobe won't allow you to use the same license.Perhaps the most excellent use is engineering and note taking, if you need to draw a lot of charts, sketches, diagrams, formulas, tables, schematics, or anything that you can't type with a keyboard, then you will love the Samsung ATIV. The wide angle form factor is a tad inconvenient, I would much prefer a US Letter or an A4 size. The ATIV's display is 5 3/4\" x 10\" (145mm x 254mm) -- imagine an iPad stretched all the way to be wide-screen long.If you just want a tablet and a laptop, then you're better of buying a separate netbook and a tablet. If you don't get instantly excited about the possibilities of a Wacom stylus and a tablet PC, you'll find this device an overkill. A simpler consumer tablet costs less than half, weighs half as much, has no fans, and the battery lasts twice as long on a single charge. This is a hard-core tablet, folks, for those who need a real Intel processor and a super accurate stylus.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "This hybrid is the future of the computer industry ~ A simply amazing device", "Author": "Expressed Reviews \"Expressed Reviews\"", "ReviewID": "RNY46S2SGFBCL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My son, a software engineer, recently had the opportunity to try out the Samsung ATIV Smart PC Pro 700T. I'm writing this review based on notes that I took over the weekend regarding his brief encounter with this new Windows 8 based hybrid tablet computer. Before reviewing the computer, I would like to point out a few of the comments that he made regarding the Windows 8 platform. In his opinion; the highly anticipated Windows 8 was superb, but be prepared to spend a little time learning the new OS. Once learned, it's a very simple and well thought out design. There are many hidden controls on Windows 8, which in his opinion is a good thing as it saves precious real estate. No doubt, Microsoft had this in mind when they designed their new OS. You simply move the cursor to the corner of the screen to find the out of sight controls. He found this to be very easy to learn and after a few minutes of use, highly intuitive. As a big Apple fan and iPad enthusiast, he was more than impressed with the Windows 8 OS. While requiring a little more learning time, it compares very favorably with OS X from Apple. As for the Samsung ATIV Smart PC Pro 700T; he absolutely loved it. The device comes with an impressive 11.6-in. touch LED that quickly attaches to a keyboard base. You simply push a button at the top of the keyboard to release the display screen. The HD screen is very impressive, and provides the capability for 1920 x 1080 resolution. The hybrid laptop/tablet computer weighs in at less than 2 pounds and comes with Intel's Core i5-3317U chip. It includes 4GB RAM and a 128GB SSD. Since the keyboard detaches from the main display in less than a second; this is a true hybrid device and in his opinion, the future of computing. This is a legitimate, fully functional laptop computer, and a fully functional tablet computer, similar to the iPad. In the full function keyboard mode, the device operates no differently than a regular laptop or desktop PC. The keyboard touch-pad is a breeze to use. With the keyboard detached, you have a fabulous tablet capable of performing virtually any task imaginable. Samsung thought of everything on this device, including a 2-megapixel HD front webcam and 8-megapixel HD back webcam. The 8-megapixel rear webcam allows for superb images and is a major step above the iPad. The built-in stereo speakers are quite impressive for a device of this size. There's also a headphone jack for external speakers or private listening. It comes with a wireless N connectivity, with ability to connect to older networks as well. It also sports a Micro HDMI, a USB 3.0 port and Micro SD slot. The tablet can be used with your fingers or with the S pen that comes with it. The bottom line is that this is a high-end, fully functional laptop/desktop/tablet computer, capable of doing just about anything, just about anywhere.Pros: Fully functional laptop or tablet computer  Superb Windows 8 OS  Keyboard, touch-pad, or S Pen operation  Magnificent high resolution HD screen  Long lasting battery  Super fast Intel Core i5 processor  Much more functionality than iPad  3G or 4G LTE compatible  Reasonably priced for what you getCons: Slightly heavier than an iPad (Insignificant, especially when used without keyboard)  Slightly longer learning curve than iPad (Insignificant)Final thoughts: This device is the future of computing. While the iPad is a revolutionary tablet; this device goes beyond the capabilities of the iPad and is an overall better computing system. There is virtually nothing that can't be done with this incredible new offering from Samsung and Microsoft. Apple will have a run for its money with the introduction of this amazing new hybrid laptop/notebook computer. One last note: I own the new 3rd generation iPad which I consider to be an excellent device. In my opinion; it has always been the standard to which others are trying to catch up to. From what my son has told me, the Samsung ATIV Smart PC Pro 700T is capable of doing so much more than an iPad, that I may consider purchasing one. I honestly believe that the domination of the iPad in the tablet market will come to an end, as more and more hybrid devices such as this Samsung come on the market. Apple may actually have to play catch-up for a change.", "Date": "October 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Defective pen input, unstable in dock, scratches easily, way too many flaws for the price.", "Author": "Jimmy422", "ReviewID": "R2138544EKMB6J", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "[UPDATE: 11/16]Okay, I've spent less than 4 days with this tablet, and although my initial impressions were positive, I can't stand this tablet after some practical use.Let's start out with the kicker - the pen input. The ONLY reason I got this tablet over a competing tablet/hybrid device. And you know what? It's broke. And I'd like to say it was on just one tablet, but it's happened on two of them. I can't keep driving to a far-away store to get another replacement. When you try writing in the upper left (in this tablet at least, the last one was the upper middle and middle) it doesn't even recognize the pen is being used. If I'm in OneNote, this means the on-screen keyboard opens and starts typing all over my notes. If i'm in paint or photoshop, this means it's going to randomly start using my palm as the brush and puts a ton of marks all over my image. It's possible to avoid it if i'm VERY careful and use a certain area of the screen, but for the amount of money I'm paying for this tablet, that's completely unacceptable. I've tried updating the pen driver, disabling touch, and contacting Samsung, all of which were no use.Second, this tablet is useless in the keyboard dock. Forget it if you want to put it in your lap. It easily tips backwards and I have to hold on to the keyboard base if I don't want it sliding off onto the floor. And on a flat surface? It's fine, except for the fact that it doesn't work half the time. I'll be typing and the keyboard will stop working. Or maybe the trackpad will stop working. Or maybe they'll both stop working. It's a gamble to see what goes out first. There's no warning either - no disconnection sound, no loss of functionality in the dock's USB ports, nothing. Just a complete lack of mouse and keyboard input.And finally, having this in the front pocket of my backpack, with NOTHING else in that pocket and nothing sharp poking on it, it still has managed to get a ton of nasty, deep scratches in the cheap plastic backing. I could breathe on this plastic and it would scratch. The least Samsung could do was have an aluminum backing, but in the interest of cost and (i'm assuming) weight, they decided to cheap out.I really wanted to like this. The specs are great, and on paper it sounds like a fantastic device. It has the most beautiful display I've ever seen on a tablet. It's incredibly fast. I was willing to drive 200 miles to get another one, thinking the first was faulty. But this is inexcusable. It might have been a little more excusable if Samsung offered some kind of support, but they didn't, and honestly, the fact that I'd have to send back a product that's not even a two days old and I paid this much money for it, it's just not worth my time.[Original Review]After reading a previous review that mentioned I could get this at the Microsoft store, I decided to check with the one in Florida and sure enough they had just gotten some. I picked one ofthese bad boys up and so far, i've been quite impressed.The tablet is VERY fast. It boots in under 7 seconds. Sleep and resume is near instantaneous. Photoshop and Dreamweaver run flawlessly. Inking has ZERO lag (Unlike the Atom model!).It's very sleek. I've taken it to class in college and gotten comments on how slim it is and how cool it is. The keyboard is the perfect size and docked it looks just like a very small notebook.The screen is GORGEOUS. It's very bright and the 1920x1080 makes it very retina-esque. I can't make out the pixels. Unfortunately, the high resolution makes UI elements somewhat small, but Samsung sets the resolution scaling at 125% so it balances out.The pen is somewhat small and does not include an eraser, which sucks. As well as this, the pen digitizer was broke on the first one I received. It would not write on a 4\" or so area on the top left and bottom right of the screen. I returned it for another one at the Microsoft store and it didn't have any problems, so I think I just got a bad one the first time around.The fans are quiet and under full load they are barely audible. There's an option under the Samsung settings menu to tone them down or keep them off (Yikes!).I have not tested the 3G/4G capabilities as I don't have a sim card, but it definitely has a slot for it.So far my only complaint is that it's kind of top-heavy when in the keyboard dock. As long as you're careful it won't tip over, but be aware that it's not exactly laptop-grade stable.I posted an unboxing on youtube, which you can search for \"Samsung Ativ Smart PC Pro (700T) Unboxing\"Overall, I think i'm going to like this.", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "An Excellent Windows 8 PC", "Author": "PensFan66", "ReviewID": "RN3WL7DKNYF72", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So, I finally received my 700t - I was lucky to get in on a Tigerdirect on Amazon deal ....  I have used the 500t for a few weeks since I received one for my Wife and Brother for Christmas, so I knew what to expect to a point ....  I am an Senior IT person in charge of Windows and VMWare at a large world wide company, so I needed some power (and I need power for some video and audio editing)This machine is nice - I do not feel that the build is cheap or feels cheap by any means.  If your looking for a metal back, then you may say this is cheap, but having some form of metal back isnt a requirement for me to have a good build quality.  As some people have mentioned, the screen is just awesome - Color, Resolution, etc ... Its just plain awesome.  Its snappy all around, booting, operation, etc ....To this point, I havent taxed it too much - so I havent heard the Fans really kick in, but I will render some audio edits or video edits, and I expect the fans to do some work - but of course it would, thats taxing the CPU alot.Keyboard - No issues so far - used it for alot of my day and I had one \"disconnect\" sound, but the keyboard stayed working without an issue.S-Pen - Being a tech, I LOVE THIS THING.  I read alot of PDF Tech Docs and I have already taken a ton of notes on the PDF - I cant stress how cool that feature is!Anything bad about the system?  Well, I wouldnt say bad, this is just basic physics - Its a tablet, the whole PC is there, so when you dock it - it will be top heavy.  On a desk, no issues - Ive never had an issue.  On my laptop if you move around too much it may dip backwards - but of course it would, unless you want a keyboard dock thats 7 pounds :)You need to decide - Do you need the power?  I do, so I am VERY happy.  I do miss the .20 or so difference between my wifes 500t and the 700t, and the 500t was lighter.  However, the 700t added features makes it a MUCH better pick for my use.  If you want iPad3 thin - go 500t.

I am a bench scientist in the biological sciences, so my primary use case for the tablet has to do with using the active digitizer to take laboratory notes as well as annotating scientific papers (which are generally PDF files these days). Because the tablet runs x86 software and has a full version of Windows 8, I am able to run my favorite document management software (Papers2) right alongside the touch- and pen-friendly Modern UI Reader application for marking up my PDFs. This represents a huge boost to my productivity and will make staying up on the literature in my discipline much easier to manage.Speaking more generally about the tablet, it is really well-built, and the screen is gorgeous and extremely crisp (retina-quality to my eyes). Battery life has been excellent, particularly when using light productivity apps as I mentioned above. In contrast to the previous reviewers, I am finding the keyboard dock to be quite usable. For me, the screen angle in the dock is just fine. The fan, which does come on from time to time, is very quiet, and the tablet doesn't get too hot. There is also a setting to keep the fan even more quiet, but I'd rather keep it cool.As a media consumption device, the tablet shines as well. Firstly, it has surprisingly loud, clear stereo speakers. I've used the tablet to watch some high bitrate 1080p video content, and the device works very well in that context, too. I've installed a couple of my favorite PC games (Medieval II Total War, Star Wars: The Old Republic, Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim), and the games run pretty well (30-40fps on medium-low quality settings). Because the screen is so high-res, I am able to leave anti-aliasing off, so the image quality is better than you'd expect based on the other quality settings.", "Date": "November 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good \"power\" Windows Tablet, with some issues...", "Author": "J. McDonald", "ReviewID": "R3KBWS4J08MVPK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Update:  I've had to lower my rating on this tablet by a bit, due to quality and customer support issues.  After six months or so, I noticed that the touch interface was no longer responding (to pen or finger) along the right or bottom edges in portrait mode... The tablet developed a 'dead zone' about 1/4 of an inch wide along those edges.  And unfortunately, when you 'full screen' a desktop mode program (e.g. browser), that's where the scroll bars lie... so you can't use them to scroll.Samsung support agreed to fix it under warranty, and they corrected it *mostly*... not completely, but enough to make it usable.  But they gave me instructions on how to use their included utility to back up my user data to an SD card before sending the tablet in for repair.  I did so, and when I got the unit back, I used this same tool to try and restore my user data.Their data restore tool *bricked* my tablet.  I called support again and they authorized another warranty return for a disk re-imaging.  When I spoke with their repair guy about how to restore my user data from the Samsung backup, he said not to try... the tool was buggy... apparently, this isn't the first time he'd had to do this.  And he couldn't recommend any other tool that would work.So, while the tablet itself is back in working order and is functioning pretty much in line with my original review, I'm afraid I have to knock off one star for the touch screen not even making it for six months, and another star for their Samsung-specific software... a backup utility that bricks your machine, and no way to re-install Windows short of a warranty return.Once this unit is out of warranty, it's just a matter of time and luck before it's useless.=======  Original Review Below  ======I've had my ATIV Smart PC 700 for a little over a month now, so I thought it was time to share some feedback.I guess the most important \"take-away\" I can offer potential buyers is that I find this to be a very good \"power\" Windows tablet, but don't buy it as an Android (or iPad) replacement; that way lies pain and regret. :-)  I still own and use my Android tablet; I just use it for different things.This Windows tablet is an *excellent* replacement for my older \"convertible\" Laptop/Tablet.  This tablet has the power and resources of a mid-range desktop system, but it's in a compact and (relatively) lightweight package.  The battery life is decent... about 6-7 hours of actual use.  (I recently made it through a 12-hour day at a conference, using the tablet to read reference material and take notes.)  The USB3 and Micro-SD ports give me plenty of decent-speed extra storage.  And I can run existing Windows programs on it and surf the web with a real \"desktop\" browser, etc.All that having been said, it's worth noting that the *Windows 8* ecosystem is nowhere near as mature as its Android or iPad brethren.  There are far fewer true Windows 8 apps, and many of the ones that are available still have some growing up to do.  That's why being able to run existing Windows programs is so vital.  In practice, I find that I generally do my tablet gaming on my Android tablet, and most of my PC gaming on a desktop system; this Windows tablet is mostly for work-type stuff... development, documentation, and reference materials.  But the Smart PC Pro fills that role with power to spare.As for the machine itself, it had a somewhat rocky start (buggy firmware and drivers), but after a number of updates from Samsung, all of the big issues seem to be worked out.  The tablet now seems to be a pretty solid \"compromise\" between tablet and power notebook.  The keyboard is decent, if not great.  After a driver update, the trackpad is functional, though it does give me far more fits than other notebooks I've used.  Once I turned off the psychotically annoying 'Automatic Brightness Adjustment', the screen is crisp, bright, and a pleasure to use.  I prefer the clamshell keyboard to the MS Surface's kickstand; I can use this design in my lap.  Like some other reviewers, I had to learn to be sure and *firmly* attach the tablet to the keyboard; mine doesn't make a noticeable 'click' to let you know it's locked.As a tablet, it's actually more powerful than you really need.  (I might've bought the Atom-based Smart PC 500 if I could've gotten it with a 128 GB SSD.)  The larger screen size is nice, and I haven't found the extra weight to be a problem.  The speakers are decent enough for personal viewing.  The cooling fan seems quiet enough under most use cases that I don't even notice it.My biggest complaint through this whole experience was with Samsung Customer Support; their performance was abysmal.  Fortunately, Samsung Engineering released updates that corrected my issues, freeing me from my reliance on their customer support personnel.So, all in all I have to give this unit 5 stars.  While I can certainly name things that could have been done better, the simple fact is that this tablet does feel solid, perform very well, and provide an excellent replacement for my older convertible tablet... which is what I wanted from it.", "Date": "February 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Impressed with functionality", "Author": "Joseph Kitzmiller", "ReviewID": "R1MK501LYFKND6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Samsung Ativ 700T Pro from the local Microsoft Store. I was very impressed with the sales person and his knowledge and willingness to help me set up the tablet. I also upgraded to Windows Pro 8 and they got me setup and ready to go. If you do this be prepared for a wait as it took about an hour once the process started for the upgrade to complete. Luckily the store was in a mall and I did some other shopping while waiting for the upgrade to complete.Buying from the Microsoft Store, the hybrid comes without any bloatware which means no S note app which I love on the Samsung Galaxy S Note 2. I was bummed, however I searched the Microsoft App store and it is there so I downloaded the App and I really like the S note App.I did have problems with the keyboard as others have described. However, I called the Microsoft Store and they told me to bring the tablet in with the keyboard and they would exchange the keyboard from an unopened box. This process was pretty quick as I had to go to the mall anyway for black Friday. The exchanged keyboard works very well. I can actually bump the unit and not have the keyboard disconnect and reconnect continuously like it was doing before. I have decided not to let me affect this review as the issue was quickly resolved with little pain from the Microsoft Store.The screen is very nice as well. In desktop mode, I notice it to be slightly grainy due to the wacom digitizer. The grain appears more noticeable in the white background of the programs that are running. In running Windows 8 Apps the grain is less noticeable. The grain does not take away from my experience as I still think it is absolutely beautiful. Not Ipad 3 beautiful but better than I was anticipating. I also like all the real estate you get with this screen. Much more useable screen space than the Ipad.HDMI out work well as well. I can output the screen to an external monitor/TV very well through the micro HDMI connection. The two wireless keyboards I have connect very easily as well. The USB 3.0 port is great to have but would also prefer another port on the tablet itself. Nice to have the two USB 2.0 ports on the keyboard. I have also used an ethernet to USB adapter and that works well.All my programs work very well as well. I have installed Adobe CS 6 suite. I was surprised how well Premiere Pro worked. I loaded up several clips on the timeline and trimmed things down to a 5 minute clip and that worked well. There were no lockups or hangups whatsoever. I even did some color corrections on the clips with no trouble. I even was able to surf the web while waiting for my clip to render. Obviously my core I7 laptop is faster, but I was happy with the speed.I downloaded the Windows 2013 suite as well and those programs work great as well. Touch seems to work better in Office 2013 than Office 2010. When I touch on an feature that requires keyboard input, the keyboard pops up and I can input text in Office 2013. Unlike Office 2010 and other windows programs, which require you to press the keyboard logo on the bottom of the screen to pop up the keyboard to type when you need to input text. This includes surfing the web which can be frustrating. I keep touch a text input field waiting for the keyboard to pop up out of habit and then remember I have to first touch the keyboard for the keyboard to pop up.Battery life has been a surprise for me as well. I was expecting terrible battery life, but the battery has been more than decent for what I am doing. I haven't done any testing so I won't quote numbers, but the battery life has more than met my expectations. Obviously not as good as the Ipad, but I cannot use my power programs on the Ipad either. Which brings me to my next point. With this hybrid PC you get the full Windows experience: Running all your programs that you would on a PC/Laptop, complete control of where your files are stored and complete access to file explorer, acces to \"Apps\", etc all in a very portable device.I was surprised by the App store as well. All the reviews I read about the App store stated there were not very many programs in the store. I had one of the first Android Tablets and I had to wait months for the same Apps to become available that were available for the Ipad. It seems to me there are alot of Apps in the Windows App store than I was expecting. However, I will say that the Apps are definately not complete. I think they were rushed out without the Apps being completely ready. I am expecting that the Apps will be quickly updated. One example is the Nook App. I signed up for a couple trial magazine subscriptions. When in tablet mode, the magazine is left with a black screen. If you tap the screen, the thumbnails for the various pages appear with the rest of the screen dark. It doesn't matter whether you are in tablet mode or have the keyboard attached. However, when you output through the micro HDMI port, you get the full magazine with no empty black screen. My desktop running Windows 8 also shows the full magazine. It seems like they disabled the magazines when not connected to external monitor. I anticipate this to be quickly resolved. I also tried out Zinio, but did not think the magazines looked as good on the hybrid screen as I would like. Even when outputted through the micro HDMI connector to external monitor, I thought the images from Zinio looked like low resolution JPeg's. The Nook magazines looked much better with better resolution.I am giving this 5 stars because, while it is not perfect, I think many of my minor gripes will be improved upon. Sure they will improve the hardware as time goes on in later versions, but I am happy with the hardware now and the functionality it provides me.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Impressive Battery and Hardware Performance", "Author": "Joonbeams", "ReviewID": "R126JOG170P7JZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I finally got my hands on one of these - an A04 model from buy.com.  As expected, mine did not come with a keyboard (more on that later).  Anyway, I'm writing to talk about the battery life.  This is a long review, so I'll post those highlights up front. In short, it has outstanding for a tablet of this spec level.  You'll see a lot of iPad comparisons - but they are mostly just for context since the iPad is a totally and completely different use case.  I've spent almost 10 days with this focusing primarily on battery life and here's what I can tell you in bullets with a little more description later (again, this is my own personal experience as an armchair techie so all necessary disclaimers apply):* Average battery life with constant, heavy use (downloads, streaming, games, many \"apps\" open) has been about 4 hours.  I don't know about you guys, but that's shockingly good for a computer of these specs - i5 processor, and 1080p display.  And when I say 4 hours, I mean 4 hours down to around 10-15%.  What I've noticed is that the first hour or so dips fast, then it stabilizes.  (I also use the \"power saver\" profile in the settings).*Average battery life with light to modest use (e.g. email, documents, web surfing) is about 5-7 hours.  So yeah, a 20% increase, but nothing to sneeze at.* Standby battery life is - ready for it? - DAYS!  I was totally blow away by this.  One thing I've loved about the iPad is its amazing standby battery life.  This isn't quite that good.  But I've noticed about a 5%-10% drop/day with each idle day on standby.  And, from what I've seen, most of this use is in the first hour or so. That's because unless you consciously place this in a \"hibernate\" mode (all systems down but not off cold), it will go into a \"sleep\" mode where only the display is off.  By tapping the button on the top left you go into sleep mode and the tablet automatically goes to hibernate after a certain period of inactivity.  Now, I have noticed that for some reason, the hibernate does not always kick in on its own.  But even there, the battery is largely preserved.* Also, no performance drop is noted when not plugged in.  The tablet is optimized to fully function withoutSo, in short summary, I can reliably expect at least 4-7 hours depending on what I'm doing.  Again, that's not quite iPad, but if you're deciding between this fully featured version and the Atom processor version, you're probably doing so for price or battery.  Well, in my humble opinion, battery is a non-factor.  If you use this heavily daily, you will likely need to charge nightly, but that's also true for the Atom version and even the iPad.Now, there are a few more points about this tablet worth noting - and many others have.  First, it is big.  I don't find it to be heavy per se (but much heavier than iPad).  But it's wide and somewhat unwieldy for a tablet. I have big hands, but my thumbs can barely cover the real estate with a two handed grip.  Windows 8 does have a split keyboard mode to account for \"thumbing\" but it's much less reliable in terms of accuracy than the main keyboard (which is quite accurate).  As such, this isn't the ideal \"gaming\" tablet or tablet for two thumb operation.  In my opinion, this is a necessary tradeoff for the functionality this delivers.  Also, as others have said, it is plastic build, but it feels quite solid and well made, so no issues there.  But the display and speed are phenomenal.  I mean, utterly ridiculous.  You will have absolutely no complaints about either (from a hardware perspective at least).Now for the \"meh: and the bad.  This tablet is not the panacea of computing just yet - but that is mostly due to Windows 8.  However, I still dock one star because I believe it's improper to dissociate the software experience from the hardware since this is a package deal (and I cannot honestly say that Windows 8 has the same issues across products since I do not know).From what I can tell, Windows 8 is largely a \"veneer\" for Windows 7.  What do I mean by that?  Well, Windows 8 has apps that run in \"live tiles.\"  Those apps are essentially \"pure Windows 8,\" but they are few.  They are also much less reliable or functional.  For example, Windows 8 has an email app.  It runs entirely via Windows 8.  But it doesn't thread conversations, you can't selectively configure notifications, and it's very spotty with real-time email pushing.  However, you can also use Outlook.  Outlook 2010 (which is available as a trial if you don't have it) is the fully-featured, and much more reliable \"app.\"  However, this runs on the very familiar Windows 7-like shell.  So if you launch Outlook from the \"Start Screen\" you will moved to the \"desktop\" which looks and runs exactly like Windows 7, except, perplexingly and annoyingly, without the start menu.  If you use IE from the desktop it is totally unconnected to the IE app from the live tile screen (and it's also of spotty reliability).  Think of the \"desktop\" as, itself, an app, but one you will use constantly even if you don't launch it yourself.  I didn't really understand all the hubbub about the start menu until I realized that many of the real PC tools, like Adobe Suite, Microsoft Office, etc. all run in the \"desktop\" and not as live tiles/Windows 8.  So you get tossed there, with no easy way to navigate since your sans start menu.  The start menu thing is easy to fix with some free third party solutions, but still, it is at the desktop, where the experience starts to drop off.I bought one of these largely for productivity reasons (and, yes, gadget lust).  As such, I spend a lot of time in the desktop (which incidentally is the only place I've found where I can get battery life info.  There is no app or main screen notification I can see).  What this means is more reliability, but no live tile updates or notifications.  Also, no more automatic keyboard loading.  When you place your cursor into a text area in any true Windows 8 app, the on screen keyboard launches.  But if you are in the desktop, you must manually launch the on screen keyboard each time.  This is annoying and cumbersome because, unlike the Windows 8 apps, the keyboard often obscures the view.  Also, again unlike Windows 8 apps, it is very difficult to accurately launch links, close windows, etc. from the desktop using your fingers or even the S-pen.  And again, there are very few useful Windows 8 apps and the ones available are limited functionality and reliability wise (kind of like iPad apps that purport to be productivity apps).Now, I mentioned that I did not get the keyboard dock with my purchase which was a bummer (not to mention b.s. by Samsung, but I digress), and a blessing in disguise.  I deliberately bought this and not a laptop because I wanted a \"tablet.\"  Not having a keyboard helped me fully navigate this device primarily as a tablet.  So for the issues above, if you're using a keyboard (and I've used a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse without issues), you probably won't notice the problems I'm raising.  But as a tablet only, this is an issue.  Sadly, that means that for real work use, I will have to lug along a keyboard until, or if, Windows goes truly to Windows 8 self-contained apps.Had the \"Windows 7 desktop\" touch aspects been more smoothly implemented, this would be, without question, a true five-star device and the \"one device to rule them all.\"  Instead, this is a laptop with a detachable keyboard.  That said, given the specs and great battery life, and the fact that it's still fully operable as a tablet only, albeit with some hiccups, it's still pretty dang cool and worth getting (if you can stomach the ridiculous price), but just a tad short of perfect.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Keyboard does not work, Samsung support is almost non-existent", "Author": "R.

There were obviously some build issues, otherwise the tablet would not have been delayed without reason by Samsung.I received my tablet on Friday the 23rd.  After connecting the keyboard dock, I turned it on.  The initial boot was insanely fast, but shortly after it began constantly playing the connect and disconnect chime due to the keyboard not being able to stay connected for more than a second or so.I contacted Samsung on Saturday, and after multiple transfers, disconnected calls, and rude customer service reps, I made it to \"Tablet Support\".  It became obvious that the tech support rep did not even know that Samsung made a tablet that ran Windows 8.  He constantly tried to correct me by saying it must be running Android or Windows 7.  When I assured him it had Windows 8, he accused me of upgrading the computer myself since \"it came with Windows 7\" and that Samsung would not longer support the computer.  I decided to quit arguing with him, and simply pointed out it was a hardware issue with the keyboard, so the operating system did not matter.  He agreed, and put me on hold without any further questions for 30 minutes until my call was suddenly disconnected.After calling back, I reached another rep and immediately asked for a supervisor.  The supervisor asked what the issue was, and after I mentioned the keyboard constantly disconnecting, he said it would need to be sent in for repair.  Just to note, Samsung did not try ANY troubleshooting, which leads me to believe this is a known issue.So, that brings me to their repair process.  I had to ship the computer to Samsung via UPS Ground, which will take 8 days.  I shipped the computer on the morning of the 26th, and it is estimated to take until the 4th to deliver from California to Texas.  I really loathe UPS Ground.  Samsung quoted 5-7 business days for repair, and then they will only ship the computer via UPS Ground back to me.All in all, I waited 1.5 months for delivery, only to receive a broken tablet with the same issues as many other reviewers.  I will have to wait 8 days for the computer to be shipped to Samsung, another 5-7 days for repair, and probably 7-8 days for it to be shipped back.

It is light, thin, nice looking, quiet, and the screen is incredible.  The tablet itself exceeds all expectations I had when ordering this device.  To clarify for some of the confused and misguided users, this device DOES come with the keyboard dock and DOES NOT have 3G/4G (A01US model).The big disappointment and the reason I only gave 3-stars is the keyboard dock is unusable.  The physical connection seems solid and well engineered but the electronic connection between the keyboard and tablet is a complete failure.  The keyboard is constantly connecting and disconnecting forcing windows to play the ever so annoying connection/disconnection chime.  Typing is next to impossible because the keyboard is only connected to the device about half the time.  I can be sitting perfectly still and just the slight movement caused by touching the screen or hitting keys forces the connection to fail.  I've spent over 4-hours dealing with Samsung Executive support who has really tried to help but they seem unequipped to send me a new dock which we both decided would be the best first step in solving the problem in lieu of sending the unit in for repair (I bought this from Amazon thru Tiger Direct so an easy and QUICK exchange is not possible).  Samsung is supposed to call me back with a solution (fingers crossed).The S-Pen is also great!  Taking notes on this screen is better than using paper and twice as good as trying to use the S-Pen on the Note II due to the much larger screen.Bottom line is this would be a 5-star unit if the keyboard worked and if they shipped the first models with 3G/4G (the pain of being an early adopter).", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Digital Sketchbook", "Author": "Jon", "ReviewID": "R3OIMB85N4O8L9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this tablet purely to enhance my creative workflow.

Perhaps the early models were flawed or there was a bad run at Samsung, but my unit has been fantastic.

Something are definitely much easier to do with a mouse and others are FAR easier with the touch screen.

The fonts are a little small for many applications, but that is the disadvantage of having such high resolution on a small screen.  Depending on what I am doing, it is easy to just go to the control panel and lower the resolution a bit.... only takes a few seconds and is an easy solution to what some people seem to see as big problem.  Sure you could buy a unit with less resolution to begin with, or you could have options.  The only strange thing I have to report concerns all the internal sensors (compass, gyro,accel. etc).... at first they seemed not to work but a quick search of the internet turned up a simple solution that worked for me - just slowly rotate the tablet through several revolutions on all three axis - EVERYTHING started working immediately.

It's not too hard to remove without damaging it (I upgraded the SSD to 256GB).The Wacom digitizer with pen is very good - but it often has tracking problems close to the edges (for example, clicking \"x\" to close a program in a Remote Desktop session can be quite difficult), but the ability to store it in the tablet itself is a huge improvement and makes the tablet much more useful.  It also has the on-pen right-click button - overall, a great accessory when you need it.The keyboard dock is good and bad.  I like very much that when I dock the tablet, it works just like an ultrabook, and I can close the laptop with it docked - though it's a bit thick.  The keyboard itself I like just fine, and the touchpad is usable (I'm not a big fan of integrated buttons, though).  Some manufacturers like to mess with the system keys - F-keys, Fn, arrows, insert and delete - but I find their locations to be acceptable on this keyboard.  I have a few complaints, though.  There's no on-dock HDMI connector.  I like to leave my dock at my desk most of the time and just plug and unplug my tablet, but since the only HDMI connector is a mini-HDMI directly on the tablet, I have to dock the tablet, remove the little cover and then plug my mini HDMI cable into it.  The way the hinge works makes the heavy tablet part dig into my thighs uncomfortably when I use it on my lap for extended periods of time, and doesn't allow the screen to open up enough.

This maybe an overall poor engineering job, or perhaps there are just some defective units.  Either way, on top of that issue, I think the keyboard is very low quality.  The keyboard keys are ok  to use(I normally type 60wpm and tested at 50wpm on it, not bad), but it is too light (too top heavy with a solidly built tablet sitting on a flimsy cheap feeling plastic keyboard) and not backlit.

The tablet itself is great - super fast, awesome stylus (tested with one-note, wow it's awesome!), superb screen & resolution, feels solidly built, etc. However I bought it for the 'convertible' aspect, so the top-heaviness and overall poor keyboard is really off-putting.For me, as a tablet this thing shines beautifully (minus the fingerprints smudges), but due to my perceived pitfalls as a \"laptop\", it just doesn't warrant the high price point.

We have a 21\" Samsung LCD for desktop, a 32\" HDTV, a 40\" HDTV, a 60\" HDTV, and this little 11\" screen.  Among all of these, there is not one single dead or stuck pixel.  I have never seen a Samsung monitor with a dead or stuck pixel.  Dead pixels may not seem like a big deal, but trust me, if you have one, you will keep noticing it.I'm not sure I like the Windows 8 OS, but if you want Windows 8, this is a great tablet/PC for your needs.  It comes with Windows 8 64-bit version.Thus far, it seems very fast when doing basic browsing and it is very stable.  The battery is outstanding.  I've been using this thing for hours, and it still has more than half the battery left.The tablet has a full USB 3.0 port on the tablet device itself, which is really nice, as well as a 64GB microSD card slot.  There is no CD-ROM drive, so you won't be able to play certain games without buying an external DVD drive.  The laptop does seem a bit heavy considering its size, but I guess it's better than having a flimsy, light weight laptop.I don't notice the problems mentioned by some other reviews.  It seems to work fine for me.  I can watch YouTube 1080p Full HD video streaming without any slowness whatsoever.  Looks good when watching it full screen.  You have to select high definition on youtube to get it to stream in high definition.The laptop is a little bit top heavy, but if you leave it on a flat surface, it stays upright (doesn't tilt over backwards).  There are two USB ports (2.0) on the keyboard/dock itself.The keyboard is as good as you can expect for the size you are getting.  it is solidly built and heavier than you might think.The CPU is an Intel Core i5 3317U.  This is a 1.7GHz dual core processor, with turboboost to 2.6 GHz.  Basically, if you are running only one thread at a time, then it will turboboost up to 2.6 GHz, which is pretty fast.  On my old machine with a CPU monitor, you could see when it goes into turbo mode, and it would go into turbo mode like most of the time.  So 2.6 GHz is pretty fast.When you get the mini laptop for the first time, I would recommend running the Samsung Software Update software to update all the software like BIOS, etc.  That's the first thing I did on this laptop, and it seems to be running fine.Anyway, this seems like a great mini laptop, if you are looking for a Windows 8 tablet/mini laptop.", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Tried both 500 and 700 with complications", "Author": "Joel Cochren", "ReviewID": "RHSFXF399QALF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I liked the idea of the S Pen and the Samsung brand but I struggled with problems on both models.

They work on the demos in the store but not the new ones I bought.  I spent time with Samsung tech advisors with no luck.

The ATIV Smart PC Pro does this very well.  Here is what I use it for:Taking notes \u2013 I use the stylus to take notes using OneNote at work.  I love the fact that I can search through my hand-written notes on the device.  There is almost no lag between the gesture and the ink on the screen.Web browsing \u2013 In place of my Android Tablet, I\u2019m couch browsing every night on this device without the keyboard attached.  It is so much faster than my old tablet.  I find the experience very enjoyable, especially now that IE 10 supports flash content in Win8 mode.Gaming \u2013 I play Guild Wars 2 with my friends.  I was amazed the integrated graphics could play this game with no problems.  It gets very hot when gaming but that is no surprise really.  The core i5 processor rocks!Sketching \u2013 I use Sketchbook Pro.  I\u2019m a doodler with dreams of becoming an artist.  My goal is to draw something every day.  It is so easy to draw using this device with its integrated Wacom digitizer that I find myself drawing a lot more than I used to.Other notes:Keyboard: I have not seen any problems with docking errors that others have reported.  The keys have a great feel but the trackpad is sub-par.  It is way too small and I always opt for a Bluetooth mouse.Bootup time: Incredible!  It is ready to go in seconds.Battery life: Not bad.  I get about 5 hours with typical use.  I wish there was a battery in the keyboard though.If I had to criticize something, it would be that the screen can be hard to read in desktop mode.  There are a lot of pixels in that small screen.  There are ways to increase the font size, but some applications cannot be adjusted.Overall this is a great hybrid device that I can easily recommend.", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tablet PC", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1UQCHER1979VA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well I've had my 700T for a couple of days now and must say that I'm very pleased with it.  The build quality is excellent and feels very solid. The weight isn't bad either although it is noticeably heavier than my Galaxy Note 10.1, of course it is MUCH MORE powerful so I'm okay with it. My keyboard works great, I haven't experienced any of the disconnect problems that I've read about. The keyboard feels good to type on also, probably due to the extra width. Wifi connections have been strong. The tablet does get a little warm towards the middle at the top, not hot but warm. The fan is also audible although it is not loud to the point of distraction.  The screen is very nice also.  The image is set to scale up by 125% in desktop mode which makes everything very legible. I tried setting it back down to 100%, which made things a little sharper but also made them uncomfortably small.  I really like how Win8 feels in a tablet form factor. Haven't upgraded my desktop yet even though I did buy the program already.The only issue that I've had with it is not being able to setup my work email exchange account in the default mail app. This is a fault in the mail app and not the tablet though. I\"ve read that certain exchange servers have settings that make them incompatible with the mail app by default. You can apparently do something with ssl certificates to get around it but it sounds like more trouble than it's worth, especially since I plan on buying Office anyway and will have access to full blown Outlook.The app store is lacking currently but having access to all of the existing windows programs makes up for that. I did find a nice comic reader app though. I had been reading comics on my Galaxy Note 10.1 with an app called Perfect Viewer (great app by the way and better than anything I've found for Win8 so far) and reading them on the higher resolution screen of the 700T is quite a treat.  I looked at a bit of the Transformer movie from Amazon Prime on it also. The sound was nice and clear and the video looked good.  I haven't tried the Netflix app on it yet.  I wish that Amazon would release a movie app for Win8. Of course they still haven't released one for Android so I'm probably in for a long wait on that one.  Watching through the website is workable but still not as nice as it would be from an app.I would love to have a 700T version with a 256gb hard drive though. The 128gb hard drive is okay but I haven't installed much of anything on it and it's down to 75gb left already. I've installed a 64gb microsd card in it which helps some though. It read the card right away with no trouble.All in all it is a great tablet and highly recommended.*Update*Just thought I'd post a quick update after having used the tablet for a couple of weeks. It has worked great so far. Still haven't experienced any of the keyboard disconnect problems reported by others. I have used the tablet with keyboard on a table, in my lap and on a bed and had no problem with disconnects.  I have tested the tablet with microsoft word and everything works great when using the keyboard. I also installed the full version of Outlook 2010 which resolved the email issue that I mentioned in my earlier review above. That also works great. I am really looking forward to the release of the 2013 office suite though, which has been specially tailored for touch screens. I did buy a usb mouse that also works really well for desktop mode use.I have also played a few games with it and they worked really well also. I played Civilization 5 and Psychonauts. When plugged in the tablet runs in a power mode which gives it some extra processing power. I tested both games without being plugged in and with being plugged in. There is a notieceable increase in performance when the tablet is plugged in. Both games were quite playable either way but I was able to turn up some of the graphic options when plugged in.  I have been getting decent battery life, about 4 to 5 hours although I haven't let it run completely out yet. Having a keyboard with an extra battery in it would be a definite improvement though.  I have read that the 128gb hard drive can be upgraded to a 256gb drive but haven't done that yet. I'm not sure that I ever will but it is nice to know that the option is there If I find that I ever need to do it.Overall I am still very happy with it.  The only other tablet out there that looks like it MIGHT be even better so far is the Lenovo Helix. It hasn't been given a release date or final specifications yet though, but the early preview rumors make it sound like a real winner.", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic, but in need of a couple improvements", "Author": "Eric O.", "ReviewID": "R8VEUG42XONOT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After much anticipation and waiting, the Slate finally arrived the other day.  Windows 8 setup is a breeze, and the entire operating system works flawlessly and fluidly on this touch-screen tablet.  The power of the processor is adequate and as expected, just as the RAM and SSD.  The overall design ALMOST mimmicks that of the previous Slate version, however, this is where the Samsung engineers went backwards instead of forward.  For starters, the keyboard dock doesn't tilt back nearly enough to make this usable as a laptop-ish device.  It is a few degrees from 90 (straight up vertical).  The weight of the keyboard is actually just right, since it has to be significant enough to keep the slate from falling backwards when opened all the way.  At the same time, we all know that keyboards aren't very heavy in themselves, which means that whatever they used to weigh it down could have had a secondary battery in its place to add to the runtime of the machine.  Other than that, the keyboard dock is of good quality, tactile keys and good stroke, although the touchpad is a little towards the lower-end with no motion add-ons and only basic usefullness.  The real problem I see is that the power connector has been moved from the side of the device (great location), to the bottom of the device (assinine location).  This prevents a user from setting it in any other cradle but the keyboard dock.  How nice would it be to not have to attach the rather heavy and useless included keyboard when charging and using the device, and instead use a much better keyboard such as the Microsoft Wedge offering that includes a stable and practical cradle/keyboard cover?  Unfortunately, with the power connector on the bottom, the Slate must sit almost an inch off of any surface.  The USB location is on the top, which, too, is a worse location than it's previous version.  The side was a much better location, but at least this version has USB 3.0.There is no such thing as the perfect tablet, so in the end I'd certainly buy this one again if all other brand offerings remained the same.

The rotation lock button would stop working mid session (likely software conflict with the graphics driver).  Everyone uses these things for different reasons.  For me, it's as a pen tablet, and then as a semi- laptop.

Great tablet!  It has the power of a desktop in a small form factor.  I was scared of the keyboard from all the negative reviews, but mine works perfectly fine.  The size is a bit awkward to hold and I wish there was a stand case available for it (I know I can dock it in the keyboard, but if I wanted a laptop I would have bought one), but these are minor complaints.  The screen is beautiful and I am glad I went with a tablet with full HD.  I like the onscreen keyboard, it seems easier to type on than my iPad, and I am going to attribute that to the wider size of the screen.

Sola \"solar513\"", "ReviewID": "R1OWDLB4NSWBNS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had been on the market for a new tablet monitor and after weeks of research settled for a tablet PC instead.  It's form factor is smaller and it's far more portable than a tablet monitor which is an excellent device for on the go.There are some pretty major cons to accompany the pros so lets get to it:Pros:Large Screen.  This has a fantastic large HD screen spanning 11.6'' screen at 1920x1080 resolution.  Pixels do not appear on this easily.  The screen is very glossy and clear.  This can be a bit of a drawback since at times it is a bit TOO wide landscape-wise or too narrow portrait-wise.Full Size Keyboard.  This is non-negotiable for me.  The full size keyboard has chiklet keys that are easy to to type on.Ports.  There is a USB 3.0 port, a mini HDMI port, and a micro SD slot all part of the tablet.  The keyboard dock has 2 USB 2.0 ports.Home button.  Is part of the tablet as well.  It is useful when you don't have the tablet docked and need to return to the windows 8 screen.Speakers.  Front facing and has pretty decent sound quality.  I think it is odd that a lot of tablets have rear facing or bottom facing speakers which leads to sounds being muffled by your lap or hands.Stylus.  The stylus has a reservoir located on the bottom side of the tablet that you can reach easily.  Even when the tablet is docked, there's a wedge cut out to prevent you from having to undock, and pull out the stylus which is good design.  It isn't something that sits against the tablet like the Windows Surface Pro which would fall off if you jostled it even slightly.  While the stylus doesn't have an eraser, I don't feel too upset about that.  There is a button that acts as a right click.  According to the website, it has 1024 levels of pressure sensitivity.Cons:Touchpad.  There's something that feels odd about pressing the bottom edge for right or left clicking.  It's doable but it feels weird to me.  The biggest complaint is that your palms often rest on the edges of the touchpad which often brings up the right edge options on screen.  By often I mean every couple seconds of typing.Keyboard Dock. While the tablet has a decent battery inside, I feel like the keyboard dock not having a battery extender was a missed opportunity. Some people have complained that the dock suffers from connectivity issues but I haven't had this experience.  Another odd choice is that the dock connector itself allows for only one way of insertion, so you can't turn the tablet around and close the book.  The dock doesn't allow for bending far, which can be annoying if you are sitting at an odd angle.  I can understand why they did this, the dock itself is very light and the tablet would be extremely top heavy but it's still annoying.Wifi.  Has cut out randomly a couple times.  It goes down stays down for a few minutes and magically repairs itself.  Hard to explain why but it's kind of a drag when you are patching.Windows 8.  I understand that Windows 8 had tablets in mind which is fine and I accept that, however because this is a tablet PC it feels odd to treat some functions of this machine as just a tablet.  The windows screen is really strange to me and largely unnecessary and while I can see future use for it, not many programs I download use it specifically so I'm on the desktop more often than the windows screen.Battery.  Most tablets have their batteries inserted inside the chassis which means it has an expiration date which means at some point your tablet will not hold the same charge as it did when it was new.  The Ativ is one of those tablets.This tablet has full Windows 8 (64bit) on it and a decent 128 ssd disk space.  The Intel i5 processor coupled with the 4gigs of RAM ensures that the experience will be quick and snappy.  The Ativ has a weaker counterpart that uses the atom processor but I wouldn't suggest it if you are planning for the future.  You have to be pretty choosy about what programs and files you want to keep on this machine since you have a finite amount of space but thankfully there is a microSD slot for up to 64 gigs.Applications.  I installed Photoshop CS6 on it and it works like a dream.  There has been issues with the image suddenly scrolling in a direction when my palm is resting on the screen and it's happened far more often than I care to admit.  The pressure sensitivity requires some getting use to but it doesn't take much, though there has been weird issues with the cursor not lining up to where it should be which makes drawings at times really annoying.  Rebooting the machine fixes this, but I hope it gets fixed down the road.  There has been jitter issues but nothing too bad, certainly not as bad as iPad.  Drawing when everything works has been great.  The stylus though small, feels great in the hand.  I sometimes hit the button the stylus which acts as right click but not too often.  While the stylus from my Samsung Galaxy Note works on the tablet, the Intuos5 does NOT.While you could game on this, I wouldn't suggest it.  The video card is par...if that.  I've downloaded WoW on it and it runs at 25 fps at middle of the road settings.  I'm contemplating putting steam to see how other games work but as I don't see myself gaming on the go, this is something that is far down on the to-do list.Conclusion: With some minor bugs that prevent me from completely raving about this tablet PC, I have been pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoy working with it.  I haven't encountered the same issues others have experienced, such as the dock connectivity, or the BSOD (blue screen of death).  While it won't replace your desktop at home, it's a good on-the-go machine.Update 3 weeks into owning it: I am still enjoying the tablet PC.  I've since downloaded Sketchbook Pro and have been using this over Photoshop and am totally enamored by it.  The tablet stylus is nice, but it lacks the tilt functionality that the Intuos 5 has and SBP doesn't utilize multitouch so you can use your fingers to resize and rotate the image you're working on.  I've been testing the battery life while I draw on it without being near an electrical socket and after an hour and a half of consistant drawing, the Ativ is sitting at 76% which is pretty good considering how much power it needs to run a program like SBP.  I still haven't had any of the keyboard docking issues that people have complained about.  Even though I was concerned that the tablet may be TOO wide, having a drawing program open and the picture I'm drawing from side by side has assuaged my worries.Update as of 5/6/13: I found the settings to lower the sensitivity of palm detection on the touchpad and the icon skipping about randomly has gone away.  I've also disabled the touchpad right swipe so the weird Windows 8 icons don't keep popping up.  Due to the strangeness that is Windows 8, you have to go digging to find these settings.", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best Windows 8 Tablet I Could Find", "Author": "S. Martin", "ReviewID": "R2YP3ROGW75K9L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been researching Windows 8 Tablets for a while now trying to decide which to get. I had it narrowed down to the Microsoft Surface Pro Tablet or the Dell XPS 12 Ultrabook, or the Samsung ATIV XE700T1C-A01US Smart PC Pro 700T. I had been using a Toshiba Tablet PC for the last 4-5 years and it has worked great but I was ready for something new and needed to learn the ins and outs of Windows 8 so that I can fully support it with my clients.I ruled out the Dell early on as I wanted a pure slate tablet this time around rather than a convertible like my last tablet so I could save on weight and take better advantage of the touch screen. Having the keyboard always attached makes it so that being in slate mode is heavy and bulky.So, that took me down to the Surface and the 700T. I chose the Samsung 700T for 3 main reasons.1. First of all the screen is a little bit bigger but has the same screen resolution. Since the screens are pretty tiny compared to regular laptops, I thought a little larger screen would be a good thing. The high screen resolution (1920 x 1080) is VERY important to me. I want all the screen real estate I can get.2. You get an extra 2 hours of battery life per charge with the 700T. From reviews I've read, the Surface gets around 4 hours a battery charge while the Samsung gets about 6.5 hours per charge.3. The keyboard. The Surface has a flimsy little keyboard that uses magnets to attach to the Surface Pro. When typing, you really MUST be on a flat surface like a table. It makes it difficult to have the device in your lap. The Samsung 700T has a stiffer keyboard that is more like a regular laptop keyboard. I can use it in my lap, on the armrest of my couch, and other places and it is very stable. And, if people are willing to admit it, touch alone just isn't very productive. You need a good keyboard to be able to type with any real speed and accuracy.4. (Edit added 4-3-13) One more thing that pushed me to the 700T over the Surface is the weight. The 700T is basically the same weight as the Surface (2 lbs) even though it has the larger screen. Some people complain that the 700T is plastic, I don't have a problem with that and it still feels quite solidly built.And, for those three (four) reasons above, I feel I made the right choice. I have a client that purchased a Surface Pro and he has told me that those are the very things that he doesn't like about the Surface. My only complain is the hard drive capacity. I was really wanting something with a 256GB solid state drive. But, this will do for now.As for Windows 8? I believe it is pretty useless if you don't have a touch screen. Microsoft invested too heavily in re-creating Windows for touch screens. Guess What Microsoft, the majority of Windows users work at a desk with a keyboard and mouse and now they have to do some funky mouse movements in order to use their computers. And don't even get me started on the new Start Menu. Lets just say I'm not a fan. But I am happy with my Samsung 700T purchase, and that is what this review is about.", "Date": "March 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good tablet, but is it worth 1200?", "Author": "MDL", "ReviewID": "R21TAQJ6982JY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A Little Background: I owned the 700t for about 2 and a half weeks.  I am a college student and I've been looking for a solid note-taking tablet with OneNote for about 3 months.  I considered the 700T, 500T, waiting for the Surface Pro, a few random convertibles, the Asus Vivo Tab 11.6, and the Lenovo Thinkpad 2.  I went with the 700T because A) I didn't want to wait for the Surface Pro.  The 700T allowed me to have a tablet for the first few weeks of class.  B)The better hardware than the atom-based tablets.  The primary programs I used with it were: Microsoft OneNote, the rest of Microsoft Office, reading google books off of chrome (there was no app available :/ watching netflix, and listening to music.A key thing to note is that I was looking for a wacom-enabled tablet FIRST and a keyboard/laptop replacement SECOND.  I returned the ATIV 700T because of a host of minor issues, not any large glaring problem.  Also, I will attempt to give a comprehensive review.  It is tough for me to seperate which issues were Windows 8 and which were Samsung's.  Keep in mind I'm still giving it 4/5 so I'm attempting to base my rating on the 700T alone.  Finally, it should also be noted that I updated the device frequently.The first thing that I did was put the 700T on the charger while I looked over the manual.  At first I thought the cord didn't fit in the tablet very well.  It would fall out with the slightest movement, BUT it turned out the opposite was true!  I just had to push harder than I expected and it firmly clicked into place.  I say this only because I saw other reviews that complained about this connection.After charging the device I ran through the setup and update process.  It took me all of 3 minutes of using the device before I was frustrated with the on-screen keyboard.  As others have noted, it doesn't pop-up automatically about 80% of the time.  I know this is strictly a Win8 issue and has nothing to do with Samsung.  However, I cannot believe this simple issue got past Microsoft..  I imagine/hope it will be fixed very soon, but it made the tablet very diffcult to use at times.  (There were moments when I had chrome in full-screen and I couldn't get the digital keyboard to pop-up.  I actually had to get my bluetooth keyboard out just to navigate the web...)The first thing I checked after the updates was the keyboard dock.  Blessedly, mine connected wonderfully and I never had a problem with it.  The weight of it is very awkward though.  A) The keyboard was HEAVY.  for some reason it *felt* heavier than the tablet even though I knew it wasn't.  B) On top of that, the keyboard is back-heavy while the tablet is top-heavy, so tipping was an issue.  I don't know why Samsung didn't move some of the weight to the front of the keyboard, or toss a battery in there to make it more stable.OneNote experience:  OneNote usage was almost everything I wanted it to be.  The pen input was great.  The only issue I had was about a centimeter jump on the left side of the screen (in portrait.)  It made clicking a file tab into a little dance with the stylus, this happened with a variety of programs, not just onenote.  Calibration did not fix the problem.  Importing and annotating powerpoints and PDFs was quick and easy.The Screen:  The 1080p screen was gorgeous! vivid colors, netflix looked great.  It was one of the best things about this tablet (and not really a huge factor when I decided to buy it.)  My main complaint is the size of some of the buttons.  Trying to click the close button, or the maximize button with a finger was...difficult at best.  For my next tablet, I'm gonna try a 720p one just to see if that helps this issue.  I did have the windows enlarged icons setting enabled, but that seemed to only do that for desktop icons.  It didn't help with the super-small icons and links in webpages.Web-browsing:  Here was another place I ran into some issues.  Aside from the on-screen keyboard and small icons.  The tablet (or windows 8, I'm not sure.) wouldn't handle the pop-up java-like windows.  I'm taking 3 online courses, and I couldn't send e-mails or submit assignments with the online service my school uses.  (The window would pop-up but the 'send' or 'submit' buttons would be off-screen..  Also one of my main uses for this tablet was reading my book library from Google.  There wasn't an app in the windows store, so I had to do it through google chrome.  This worked fine with the pen or a bluetooth mouse, but anytime I tried to turn a page with my finger, it would go 2 pages.Some general positives:  The battery-life/boot time.  Was the battery-life great? No.  I had a long day of homework and I eeked out 5 hrs before I needed the power cord.  That being said, the boot-up time was super-fast, and the sleep-state allowed the tablet to easily last a full day of classes because it wasn't in constant use.  I'm still gonna see if I enjoy the atom-based battery life more.The Straws that Broke the Camel's Back:  I had a whole bunch of little isolated problems that led me to return this device.  1) Wi-fi was fishy.  I had 0 problems on my home network.  At school however it would erratically connect and disconnect, or not connect at all.  It was so random there was no way to troubleshoot.. 2)Similar issues with bluetooth.  It connected to my keyboard and mouse initially fine.  After that first time though I would have to make it forget the bluetooth device and re-detect it.  Sometimes it would do this, sometimes it wouldn't (sometimes it wouldn't even be able to forget the device for some reason.)  I found that I could circumvent this by leaving the bluetooth devices on all the time, I didn't like it, but it worked. 3) The device would randomly shut off.  Over the 2.5 weeks I owned it I probably had this happen about 10 times.  It wasn't the end of the world because the thing boots in about 6 seconds, but there was no warning, and I lost what I was working on. 4) The auto-rotate would stop working.  Yes, I know about the autorotate button, it didn't help.  The only way I could fix it was a restart.Conclusion:  Samsung's ATIV 700T is a powerful piece of machinery.  Especially if you're looking for a tablet and not a laptop-replacement.  For my current demands, I actually found the hardware to be a little bit overkill, and I hope I don't regret passing up the power in 2 years.  The final deal-breaker for me was the price.  at $1200, I expect a nearly-flawless tablet experience, and I didn't get that from the 700T.  Whether it was Microsoft issues or Samsung issues; they come as a full package so I couldn't just ignore Windows 8 problems.  At this price-point it's either a very expensive tablet, or an inexpensive ultrabook.  I absolutely would have kept the 700T if I had only paid $800-900 for it.  At that price, I could overlook those issues that would probably be fixed eventually.  For now, I'm trying to decide between the 500T, the Asus VivoTab 11.6, or the Surface Pro.I hope my long-winded review is helpful to some of you.

I also travel and teach with tablets regularly, so they get a good workout.I first purchased the Samsung ATIV T500, but returned it because the Atom processor was far too slow for many of my very large documents.  The T700 is significantly faster and handles all documents with ease.

The pen also works very well for writing, which involves much of my work.  The tablet has a nice slot to store the pen.  I haven't found the smaller pen size to be difficult to write with.  The pen lacks an 'eraser'.  The handwriting recognition with Windows 8 is vastly improved over Windows 7 and hasn't required any training.

Back in December I bought 2 XE500 units - one of which was flawless and the other was a complete disaster so I returned it and replaced it with the Asus VivoTab TF810C. ATOM tablet but unfortunately it too has been plagued with problems, having been RMA'd to Ausus twice now. The last time - the screen just went dead.  I loved the battery life 13+ hours, but it wasn't a workhorse and I couldn't rely on it, so  This Smart PC Pro XE700T1C replaces Asus and I must say I am impressed.  This unit has none of the keyboard disconnect issues we read so much about and the screen is magnificent.  The Keyboard has very good spacing between keys, and great tactile feel & response action.  And, there is plenty of palm support on the deck next to the mouse pad.  All in all it is a very satisfying experience.  The only complaint with the keyboard is that for this price there really should be an extra battery in it and the Elan Track Pad isn't quite as nice as a Synaptics track Pad - it does work fine there are plenty of user settings for fine tuning, it's just a little less refined than a Synaptics device.The screen on this thing is magnificent, in fact the screen on the XE500 is also brilliant - I still have one (my wife's machine).  In some ways the lesser resolution on the 500 is preferable, because on an 11.6 in screen, this high pixel count really produces very small text - I think the ideal resoution for an 11.6 screen really is 1368 x 766 - none-the-less this screen sure is crisp and bright.The Wacom digitizer on thing is also fantastic.  I've been buying windows tablets all the way back to Win XP (Have had no less than 4 Fujitsu Convertibles) and this Smasung is the best implimentation of the Wacom technology yet.  On this unit there is absolutely no lag in the digital inking experience.  We have two Atom Tablets in our home (the Asus and the Samsung Smart PC 500T) and both of those do suffer some inking lag.  Not this baby.  It's very responsive. But there is one caveat: Samsung should really have embedded a built in eraser into the stylus. There is a right click button on the pen - at the very least this should be a customizable button - to change the function to erase.As others have commented, the tablet portion is a little top heavy in relation to the dock but that it totally reasonable considering the guts stuffed inside this little case.  However, I must state base on real world usage that claims that it flips over because of the weight distribution are way over stated.  I'm typing this on the tablet connected to the keyboard dock in my lap and the balance is just fine.  On a desk or table it is just as stable as any other laptop I've ever owned.So, in conclusion, I've now had 3 Samsung Smart PCs - 2 Atom and One Core;  One was plagued with keyboard disconnect issues, the other two work perfectly.
