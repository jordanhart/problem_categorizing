For the money I almost bought an Hp with a T6600 processor and 320GB hard drive etc etc. I bought this for the same price as the other hp and got MORE memory and a better processor. Why wouldn't you want an upgrade of 180 GB hard drive for free? If your a student and like to have lots of music, videos and play light gaming and still have tons of room for your homework and projects, this is a great computer.I also love how its 14\" monitor, so I can take it anywhere and fit it into any bag. It has a very sleek and glossy exterior. A little bit of work to keep clean, but that's no reason not to buy a computer. The speakers are great for a laptop. I was actually surprised how clear sounds and music was.  As with most HP laptops, you get the lightscribe burner, which is great, but it also comes with a disc replacement thing so if you don't care to use a disc drive, you can remove it and save some weight. But really it doesn't weigh that much.The only downfall I have with this computer is the slightly low battery life. I think a little bit of that might be my fault cause I just plugged in and played rather than letting the battery charge fully first before I started playing with it.Great laptop for the price.", "Date": "February 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good system, recommended for most", "Author": "Jonathan R. Rynd \"seeker of quality\"", "ReviewID": "RO1BQQS0ZJ4MK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good system to own if you can deal with a few minor annoyances.Windows 7 works well. Most things are in different places than XP but it's easy to find them.This system has a basic graphics card. The Windows Experience numbers warn that the Aero interface will be sluggish sometimes, and I definitely feel that's true.The hard drive impressively large, although not all the 500GB is usable. It is split up into three partitions. One is the system restore partition (since Windows install discs are not included), and one is the quickstart partition (a fast starting non-Windows environment that lets you surf the web and browse your media collection), so the hard drive really has only around 320 mb free when you get it. That's lots for your pictures, videos, music, etc. It's also quite speedy.4GB RAM standard, which should be more than enough, except that about 1.5 GB are used for the integrated graphics so you only have around 2.5 GB for programs. In the future, when RAM prices come down, I'll be upgrading to 8GB of RAM.The only ads on the machine are trials of Norton Internet Security 2010 1-User, and Microsoft Office Standard 2007 FULL VERSION, prominent links to HP's accessories store (buy from Amazon instead), an ad for an online backup service, and an icon for one of Amazon's competitors (a Bay Area auction site). Not bad.I have no problems with overheating here. The touch panel for adjusting volume is very very useful.", "Date": "May 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Many features in a compact package -- a great choice!", "Author": "Deacon Blues", "ReviewID": "RMQSPPN0STARD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did mountains of research before committing to a replacement for my dead Sony (second dead Vaio = end of brand loyalty), and I chose this HP for its performance, value, and seeming sturdiness.  The new i3 processor is fantastic and there is plenty of RAM to handle multitasking.  I haven't even had to pace myself with my computing whims -- I'm downloading, word processing, virus-scanning, and listening to music without worrying about overloading the system.  What I like most about this laptop is the big bright display, which for me was important in the switch from 15.4 to 14.1 -- nothing else in this price range compares.  Finally, the machine is built well compared to others in this price range (I'm looking in your direction Asus and Acer).Some reviewers have mentioned overheating, and I was apprehensive about this -- and after buying I was constantly monitoring the temp to see if a return was in my immediate future.  But really it's not so bad, better than my last Sony, and I do believe that having the i3 processor  (still blazing fast, mind you) minimizes this problem in this configuration.  But if heat is your number one concern, sacrifice more computing power and go for one of the new super-mobile types with the dainty processors.  They will stay cooler of course.Overall, I am extremely pleased with this purchase and would recommend this HP laptop to my friends, family, and to all of you!", "Date": "May 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Value", "Author": "M.

There's a decent amount of junk software preloaded, but also some useful software (media organizers/ players, etc), and useless but fun games.Other than that, what's not to like, especially now that it's $50 less than the $700 I paid for it? It's 14\", so it's transportable. Has a DVD drive, a ton of memory, is really fast. Multiple programs run easily. Battery lasts about three hours, but can last longer with wireless/ speakers turned off.In contrast to some negative reviews, I have had zero problems with the computer overheating. The only reasons I can think to not purchase it are if you wanted either Bluetooth or Bluray capabilities directly installed, as it doesn't have either.EDITEverything I said previously was true, but I have altered my rating to take into account the poor lifetime of the laptop. The battery power fell to zero seconds within 12 months, and the cord powering the monitor became defective within 18 months, allowing only certain specific viewing angles, and causing general frustration.", "Date": "March 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pretty good computer", "Author": "J.

The screen size is perfect, not too big and not too small, and the weight is perfect as well. The only problem I have with this laptop is the mouse pad area. I guess as with any laptop, the mouse seems to have a mind of it's own a lot. Sometimes the mouse won't even move at all when you are moving your finger on the pad. It jumps around and randomly selects things when you didn't want it to. I've noticed the same problem with my friends HP laptops as well.

However, after carefully researching specs and reviews of other choices, the HP Pavilion was the best buy. HP Pavilion DV4-2161NR 14.1-Inch Laptop (Black) Faster RAM (DDR3), huge Hard Drive (500 GIG), and a 2.13 Processor.  The cost was a little more than I planned, but the trade off for satisfaction will be worth it.  The only issues has been the 64 bit OS.  Although not the fault of the computer, I haven't been successful in getting Microsoft 2003 Office suite to load. My only concern was when Norton's was doing some maintenance the hard drive was quite noisy.  Other than that it runs quiet.  I haven't tested the burning features.  Although my experience on cam-coders is limited, camera quality appears above average.  Sound is impressive and the ability to adjust the sound by touching a lighted control is a great feature.  You can turn off the wireless with a simple touch also.  Battery life is only fair.

Battery was not charging. After some talking with HP online support, I had to send it for repair. HP replaced a circuit board and the battery, but I think the battery was good and the circuit board of the notebook was not working.Both online support and authorized service center were good and fast. I got it repaired in one week.However, I'm worried with future problems. If HP let a basic defect like this to pass, what other issues may arise?Another issue is that the warranty start date is not the purchase date. It's 3 months before.

I had an old HP laptop before that was so heavy carrying it around was more of a burden than my luggage!I would say that it is a little heavier than I expected but again it's nothing compared to my last one so I'm fine with the weight. The only thing I am not sure about is the Microsoft Office Programs that come with it. Everytime I open Word 2007 it keeps asking me for some code that is supposed to be located on the side of the box that the program came in... I check the box that the Notebook came in... there ain't no such box or code in there...

I asked for this HP Pavillion DV-4 laptop for portability, ease of use, and it's features. For about 7 months, the laptop worked marvelously. And then...The computer began to shut down automatically with nearly 80 percent battery life in it. This seems to be the only problem that this computer has is that the battery life diminishes at an alarming rate. First 2 hours fully charged, then 1 hour and 30 minutes, then 1 hour. Now, I am lucky enough to get even 15 minutes of battery life. I have to keep the computer plugged in at all times so it does not crash. Well, so much for portability.I checked my warranty last week to see if I could get a replacement battery, and found out that my warranty does not cover battery replacement. How interesting that the warranty doesn't cover the only thing that plagues my computer. Overall, this computer would have been a nice 4-star or even 5-star machine, however, the dreadful battery life has made me rate this at 2 stars, and the lack of customer support has also brought it down to 1 star. Some people may say that my review is far too biased, and I should focus on the good parts of the computer. Well, I would gladly love to, however the basic need for a working battery overshadows anything else. How can i honestly focus on the good qualities when the computer keeps crashing without the charger in?And from the reviews I am reading, I am not alone in this.Here is my review overall:PRO's:-Sleek design-Great working touchpad-Very good ram, able to run multiple programs without any problems-Good speakers-Okay webcamCON's:-TERRIBLE battery-The two lone USB ports are too close together; you can only use one at a time (which brings up the question: what's the point of the second USB port?)-Wifi isn't too good; sometimes the connection will be lost for no reason.-A bit of a fingerprint magnetUPDATE:The computer has now officially died: it no longer turns on, plugged in or not.

From the start it likes to jump the cursor around when you are typing.  This is due to poor design of the trackpad.  Next it runs hot and overworks the heatsink fan.  Before getting this one I purchased a turion laptop which also had defects and this was sent as a replacement.  I have had two HP photosmart printers that were likewise poorly made.

I got a 3 month old DV6t-2000 i7 quad core with 8GB RAM for development purposes. I trusted in HP brand and bought this computer to see that there is absolutely no support. The computers GET issues from time to time, a well performing computer does not necessarily mean that it is a good product.The support department is going to offer you to replace the whole panel and reformat the PC if one of your key-caps(in my case up arrow) gets loose or broken. You will have to leave your PC to service department for at least a month if you have warranty, and if your warranty is over may God help you since your will have to pay several hundred dollars. There is absolutely 0 initiative, and prepare to talk to human robots. I went up to their CEO! and could not get a resolution. Managers are arrogant and chooses to fight with the customer instead of offering solutions.I am an IT expert and strongly suggest advanced and novice users to stay away from HP as far as possible...", "Date": "May 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "hopeless after sales support from HP...can't recommend this company", "Author": "evaluator", "ReviewID": "R246DRYYTXCR7G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought HP Pavilion dv5-1251nr in June, 2009 from a reputed US store.After purchase, for first few months my laptop was fine but thereafter from mid Dec'09, I started to face issues of continuous mild noise emitting from the right top corner of laptop (where power cord is attached to the body) while booting my laptop or running anti-virus scan on hard drive.I hear a metallic click click sound also (that comes twice) when I switch on my laptop by pressing power button. Again, I hear continuous noise during shut-down which is similar to that occurring during start-up and it emits similar mild noise when I open or save files from / to hard disc. This is not even one year after purchase and naturally, I started wondering how a quality (?) product can start behaving abnormally within a few months.I contacted HP tech support (1 800 474 6836) who operates from all over India (cities of Mumbai, Hyderabad, Kolkata etc.) for last few days and each time, a different technical assistant would handle the complaint when I would explain and repeat the same thing to them. Each technical person would suggest different opinions and ask to try out a service pack and/or trouble shoot different options sometimes for more than an hour but were unable to make any conclusion when it is simple and clear from the very noise that it is purely a mechanical problem and not related to vista operating system or any driver software. Some of them promised to replace the hard disc but, seemed to be extremely cautious and each time they would request me to do more repeated troubleshooting.More interestingly, HP technical assistants from Kolkata seemed to respond under a dubbed name as when I asked last name of one of them, he replied that they would not expose their names to customers !!!However, this is not the practice for HP technical assistants from Hyderabad or Mumbai !!!Exasperated, I filed a complaint at HP site ([...]) where they allow customers to fill in a complaint form when there is no provision for US customers (or any US state)! However, I entered my details clubbing all information in different form fields. I got a complaint identification number and was notified that it had been recorded and would be forwarded to the relevant department.However, I do not have any status update from HP as yet as to redress of my complaint !!!Unfortunately, I did not check and investigate reputation of HP - after sales support before laptop purchase. There are numerous complaints and posts about HP products and especially about its apathy to prompt service... some of the posts indicate that to tackle customer complaints, HP employees write favorable reviews about HP and its products over internet !!!I came to know that a number of customers filed law suit in China against HP and verdict went in customers' favor and HP had to comply with court order.Please read following posts before buying any HP product because of awful and atrocious service of this company !!!The last link gives a comparative analysis of HP with other reputed brands in the market (HP finishes last !!!).1.
