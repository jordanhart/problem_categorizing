There is nothing out there. I ended up taking the risk since I really like the spec and cant wait for Haswell.Pro- Display: Once you use this screen, anything less than 1080 will bother you. A beautiful display- Keyboard: Nothing much to say here. Work great. Love the backlit- Trackpad: Ignore what people say about Asus trackpad. Maybe they fixed it with this version but I find it good. Not the best. I have MAcbook book and I think that is the gold standard. You can customize the gestures and it works well- Design: Beautiful. Solid Built. Feels durable- Windows 8: I upgraded to Win 8. No issues. Work great- Battery: I use it primarily for work. 6 hours is what I am clocking- Sound: I read about poor sound. Frankly, it's fineCons- Fan: I do hear the fan at times. I am coming from Macbook Air so I am used to practically no noise. Frankly I am probably being picky- Wifi: Once in a while it will take an extra second or two to connect once it comes off sleep mode. Once connected zero issuesAll and all. I chose this over Acer Aspire S7 392 (tested it for a week). Performance wise both were close. Acer has the Battery advantage as it comes with Haswell and has touch. But I could not justify buying a white machine. Asus has a better trackpad. I think I am going to end up loving this machine.", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great laptop except for the trackpad", "Author": "Lara", "ReviewID": "R3TEV4QRB0RBQI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The laptop is great. It has a few annoyances like not being able to control the backlit keyboard enough and the most annoying being that the trackpad is not sensitive enough! The fact that the trackpad is such a VITAL part of the usage of the laptop, I'm going to have to take away stars.There is not even a control that allows you to increase sensitivity of the trackpad.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Average product", "Author": "Khalil Amine", "ReviewID": "R1LMREWBO1XAE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have sent it back as I was not happy with witless function.The vender told Me that they will deduct 15% which I will dispute with you if that happen", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Intel Core i7 3537U 2.0 GHz\n8 GB DDR3\n256 GB Solid-State Drive\n13.3-Inch Screen\nWindows 7 Professional", "Name": "Asus UX31A-XB73 13.3-Inch Laptop", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417bwp3J3gL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00EUMZ92S"}}
