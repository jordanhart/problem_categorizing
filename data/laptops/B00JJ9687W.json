The initial Windows 8 setup was pretty quick. A few minutes after getting used to the new Windows interface, Windows wanted to update.  I saw that there were approximately 100 updates to be applied, so I decided to just do it and get it over with.  Hours later, the updates were finally installing and then the dreaded \"Failure to update Windows\" green screen of death came up.  A call to Asus customer service told me to reinstall the O/S and try again.  That took hours and hours.I came home from work the next day and tried again.  Same thing.  Another call to Asus customer service and this time the guy at least explained that Windows was trying to force updates for Windows 8.1, which I should download.  He also suggested that I turn Windows Updates off, but I really didn't feel like that was a good idea.  I tried to download Windows 8.1 from the Microsoft store, but of course Windows wouldn't let me do this until I updated.  I figured I'd give it one more shot.  It took forever, but Windows finally updated, I downloaded Windows 8.1 for free and now everything is fine.I've only had it for a few days, but it's working flawlessly.  Nice touch screen.  No hangups or slowness.  I really like this laptop, but I can't give it any higher than 3 stars because of the Windows update issue.", "Date": "June 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worst computer I've ever owned", "Author": "Pancho's Kindle", "ReviewID": "R1EHFYGDS4O2QZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This piece of junk is the worst machine I've ever had to deal with.  Microsoft Updates hangs the machine up in a \"Failed to configure updates\" loop and it's all but impossible to get it out.  I can't even safe start because the hangup is somewhere in the BIOS.  I have managed to work around it with an Ubuntu boot USB that confused the Asus enough to get me to the repair screen.  Fortunately, the first time I had this catastrophe I made a restore point and and was able to restore back it (yesterday).  It's not a week old.  Here's the thing: YOU CAN'T INSTALL ANY UPDATES!!!  What-a-piece-of-#$@!", "Date": "June 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Slow, Unreliable", "Author": "Juancarlos Manon", "ReviewID": "RQU0M3XA79BUA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop recently thinking that it would be a satisfactory replacement for my HP G60 laptop that has been suffering from the blue-screen-of-death, however, my experience with this product has been abysmal. First, the Windows 8 OS that comes with this computer doesn't function correctly - some apps simply will NOT open. I attempted to open the Store App to see if I could update to Windows 8.1 and every time I received an error message stating, \"cannot connect to the server, please try again in a few minutes.\" (when I was CLEARLY connected to the Internet since I was browsing the web on IE and Mozilla Firefox while I was trying to access the application). I should also note that the optical disk drive was faulty and wouldn't close completely. You literally have to HOLD the disk drive in so that the PC can read from the DVD, disc, or any other form of media of your choosing. Unfortunately, I had to hold the disk drive IN as I was installing the software that accompanied my wireless mouse; a highly unpleasant experience. I also kept encountering a myriad of pop-up ads and spam as I browsed the web using Firefox (I'm not sure why since I had Norton 360 installed on my computer and pop-ups disabled). Despite having antivirus software installed, I still came across a vast array of annoying pop-ups and advertisements. This is most likely not attributed to Firefox nor Norton since I am currently using both on my desktop computer and they work just fine. The web browsing experience on this PC was relatively slow and distasteful. This PC also did not come with Adobe Flash Player pre-installed (although I'm not entirely sure if it's supposed to but nonetheless I found it to be a nuisance to actually search it up and install it myself). The touchscreen monitor worked well, although it should be noted that the aforementioned negative qualities of this product greatly surpass the presence of the monitor.All in all, a very, very bad product and I would not recommend it by any means. DO NOT BUY. I'd much rather recommend an HP product or a MacBook. This is the FIRST time I purchased a notebook PC from ASUS and thus far I am sorely displeased with the quality of Windows 8 and the hardware itself. Again, I strongly urge any readers and potential buyers not to buy this product.", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awful", "Author": "Ally Wakeman", "ReviewID": "RG89TRXZRX7N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This laptop is awful, it is always lagging and having malefactions.
