Feels really light when compared to 15' notebooks# Nice display and nice vivid colors !!# Very good Sound !# Battery !# Decent video quality for low resolution webcam.# Other features : Bluetooth , HDMI , USB 3.0 port , hotkey for One touch browsingCons:# Feels slow when booting up for a brand new PC.# Loads of HP software , which may not be required# Trackpad, although is not bad but will take some time to adjust to the new feel.Overall I feel this is a great product for people who love portable laptops and mostly use it for internet , chat , music and videos .Definitely value for money if you want it for school and/or home/personal use and travel. Not sure if will serve the purpose for high CPU intensive applications though .", "Date": "July 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great laptop, I love it.", "Author": "nataliejeans", "ReviewID": "RZNWO9SX992MP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product is great!I love the laptop. It's small and super light weight. The web camera is really good. The laptop is very fast.

The monitor hinge has failed 2 times and I have had to wait 1 month each time while the unit was at HP for repair.  The third time the piece of plastic that the base of the hinge attaches to separated from the rest of the computer.  The hinge does not directly connect into the chassis, but is connected only to a 2\"X2\" piece of plastic that is held in place only by plastic tabs.  HP offers no option but at third repair trip.I would return this unit if possible because of the hinge issue.", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Travel Laptop", "Author": "David A Hamilton", "ReviewID": "R3EN4T7HEWRKBR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the HP Pavilion dm1-4210us 11.6-Inch Laptop to use while traveling. My HP Pavilion p6-2108p Desktop remains my primary PC and I also consider the dm1-4210us to be a back-up to it because it has a 500GB HD. The HP dm1-4210us is a very nice little laptop; I wanted something small enough to watch my own movies/listen to my music on a plane or in a hotel, light and easy to carry and good to check e-mail. This laptop fits the bill. My most serious complaint is the built-in speakers. The HP BEATS audio hype led me to expect some pretty good sound but these speakers are just too small to deliver. I guess that's why they sell the BEATS headphones. I'm going to make do with some headphones and a set of portable speakers. I also wish manuals were included in the box; I don't like printing out 40+ pages at home. Other than that, I am still trying to figure out my battery life. Initially, the indicators said I had about 4 hrs of battery life, considerably short of the 7 advertised and my expectations of 5-6 hrs. Today I found I had over 5 hrs of battery life indicated, more in line with what I expect. The touchpad is a bit tricky but not a problem after a short while. I did buy a wireless mouse to use when space permits but I'll be OK without it. I'm really happy with my HP Pavilion dm1-4210us and can highly recommend it.ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS 2 MONTHS IN: I'm still happy with my purchase but concerns about speed have cropped up. The dm-1 was taking a while to boot up until I got ruthless about start-up programs. It can also be slow responding while web-surfing if too many background programs are running. A key to this laptop is getting it set-up properly. The HP external speakers make a big difference in the sound quality. I really like the HDMI output to put my movies on my 32\" TV.", "Date": "September 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Our Second HP DM1", "Author": "B. Lee", "ReviewID": "R6KM65GG3HJ53", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have an earlier model with the E-350 and just recently bought my wife this model (with the E2-1800) because we really like the weight and form factor. It's surprising how HP will shoot itself in the foot putting so much bloatware. After a couple upgrades, new SSD, 8 GB (1333 mhz) of memory, Windows 8, this machine boots up in less than 20 seconds. Surfing and Microsoft Office are both pretty zippy. Watching movies is not a problem either. Plus, the VGA and HDMI ports allow dual screen monitoring, which was important to us and a reason why we did not go for an ultrabook. Plus, I did not want to pay the premium having an Intel chip. Compared to my quad-core desktop, what this machine can handle, especially at this price, is very impressive.", "Date": "September 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Better than MacbookAir in perf/price ratio", "Author": "S. Starinski \"engineer\"", "ReviewID": "R215DB245ZMUO5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Usually I write long, profusely technical reviews.This is short (busy today).I love the whole DM1Z series and was one of the first adopters a year ago, got a new model a week ago - DM1Z-4200 Customized.Here you see a ship-ready (preconfigured model) but its basis is same as for my customized DM1Z (I selected E2-1800 processor instead of stock 1200).Immediatelly I removed Harddrive & replaced with Crucial SSD, sold HDD (note: HDD is 5400 rpm speed, unlike my HP Elitebook's whose HDD is 7200rpm also coupled with SSD except it's Intel-branded).I paid $30 more for a custom config.People who waste money on MacbookAir need a life - that product is so much about appearance & hype than function, likewise iPhone fad is a fad - Motorola Atrix and Samsung galaxy beat iPhone into the dust.But I am a dry technical professional so I don't represent teenagers, kids of housewives who think anything made by Apple is \"good\".This HP is a dirt-cheap superNetbook or subNotebook whcihever term is preferred.\"super\" is because it is NOT based on Intel-Atom, but is based on much better (for Netbooks only) E2-1800 processor which offers discrete-class Videocard, this little tiny supernetbook has video capability of a full blown midrange laptop.While I do serious work on HP Elitebook - that machine costs like a used car ($2K), requires ACpower (it eats battery in 4 or some hours due to crazy hi-end video), it has nVidia, weighs and sizes like a mobile workstation.  That's fine.  BUT for travel and fun computing on the go - I got this DM1Z.Sometimes I feel weird because some days even prefer using this DM1Z instead of a powerful Elitebook which sits at home.DM1Z will run for 8-11 hours depending on how good you are with power management settings & wireless & video use, which far better than MacbookAir which is using Intel core i3/i5 processors - more suitable for fullsized laptop than ultraportable laptop or netbook which is what MacboorAir or HP DM1Z are.  Macbook air will die in 5-7 hours, and IF YOU NEED Intel core i3/i5 processing power - I just had a thought, why not get a normal laptop then?  Netbook is supposed to be optimized for portability, weight, batterylife and connectivity; in this case DM1Z is also optimized for imporessive Video card rivaling many normal-sized laptops.  I run even Adobe Photooshop, YouTube, etc and all this multitasking is tolerable, not same experience as on HP EliteBook but still UNEXPECTEDLY good for a $400 netbook!E.g. I set brightness to minimum.Also I applied antiglare film to mimick HP Elitebook & other PROFESSIONAL displays which are always Antiglare, unlike consumer cheap type which is glossy to attract fools.Not having an option for antiglare screen is my only complaint but really - film costs $10-15 (HiDef version) and no big deal, besides many people aren't using it for business like myself and actually prefer glossy/glare screen.P.S. Changing TN LCD to IPS type LCD would increase laptop price by $50 or so, and as a side note to HP's management:I WOULD PAY FOR IT if it were availableIPS is a must for professional graphics work (e.g. CAD, photography).", "Date": "September 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very happy with this little laptop -- just the right size!", "Author": "Lauren Thompson", "ReviewID": "R3VRNBXNEL9J14", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my dm1 for about two weeks, and I'm very happy with it. The size is nice, for me -- just big enough while still being portable. The screen looks great, and I love the keyboard with the \"island\" keys rather than \"chicklet\" keys. It's quiet and comfortable to type on. My computing needs involve no games and little video-streaming, so I don't need a highly-powered machine. Still, this is more than powerful enough, especially considering the low price.I work from home as a writer, and I use this laptop all over the house. I also bring it with me to the library when I need a change of scenery. I do quite a bit of internet research, and this computer handles lots of open windows and open docs with no problems. Sometimes I listen to music at the same time. Most important to me are comfort, ease of use, responsiveness considering the work I'm doing, big memory for numerous large writing projects, and aesthetics. On all those counts, this machine more than meets my needs.One complaint would be about the internal WiFi networking device. It's very slow, at most 78 Mbps. I have an external netis dongle I stick in one of the USB ports, and then I get 160 Mbps. I'll probably buy one of those tiny mini-dongles and leave it installed in a USB port. When I'm close to my router at home, I plug in an ethernet wire, and I get 1Gbps.Overall, I'm extremely happy with my HP Pavilion dm1!", "Date": "October 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Buy", "Author": "Jason S.", "ReviewID": "R37U144C9QE9E9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This little laptop has all the features I need with a low price tag.

I feel a bit dopey, having to plug in an external DVD drive if I want to watch on-disc movies.
