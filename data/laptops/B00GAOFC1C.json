It works fine for my needs - I'm not into games. This is a second computer for me; I normally work on a MAC. I upgraded my old Dell laptop because I occasionally need to use apps that are not available for MAC. I had some initial problems, which I think I caused myself by changing a setting. Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out what I'd done. I tried MS help - which is close to impossible to find on their website. No help there.Eventually got it sorted out myself by using a utility that restores original settings..since then, it's worked fine.The display is nice. I don't find the computer to be particularly slow. Battery charged quickly , but I haven't had a chance to check the battery life. My biggest complaint is the way the Start menu is configured so you have to deal with it before getting to work on the desktop when you boot the machine. Also,lots of what amounts to advertising apps - but they are easy enough to get rid of. Some other minor irritations having to do w/Windows, but it sure beats the VISTA system that was on my old laptop. As I get used to it, I'm liking it better. This laptop does have a built-in DVD player. All in all, a pretty nice basic machine for home office, school work and routine stuff. Good luck if you need tech support.", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "Lauren Franklin", "ReviewID": "R1JZ9J74G7U5HF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "computer works really well!

He is beginning to get used to the new platform however he has had it crash once already, in less than a month, and had to initiate the machine as if it were directly out of the box.  This was evidently caused by a software glitch and fortunately he doesn't have a lot of saved information - it was just very inconvenient to have to go back through and set up mail and programs all over again.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Alright", "Author": "Colby Troxell", "ReviewID": "RGVWJMGEADOQ1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Its an ok product.

(This system will not support Linux at all and will BSOD when trying to install another version of Windows)2. System has a very slow processor that also shares graphics, thus newer versions of Photoshop that has performance based off GPU will see lag issues inside Photoshop when working on large scale pieces.3.The system processes uploaded video slowly, I can turn on the same video on my XPS laptop from Netflix with no lag, Turn on the same clip with this machine and you can see alot of issues with the processing.4.The system hangs at P.O,S,T ( Power on self test ) for long periods of time and sometimes you have to reboot multiple times for it to hand off to the Boot Process.All in all if your going to use this to check email or Facebook then this will work fine but for anything else then I wouldnt recommend it.", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "great computer", "Author": "dano \"dano\"", "ReviewID": "R251G50TJNIM9C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Not happy with windows 8.

Flimsy, cheap, unreliable, and built with the cheapest components available. Save your money and spend a bit more on something else not built by Toshiba. Best case scenario, you might get 6-12 months out of your laptop before things start to fail. Worse case scenario (as I've just experienced), your laptop will last a matter of weeks before the lights go out. And unfortunately for the buyer, Toshiba often refuses to meet their own warranty obligations. Considering how cheap the laptops are, they don't want to help you, or fix the laptop. They would lose money otherwise. So if you send it in for repairs, like they'll inevitably recommend, you'll find yourself being asked to pay elaborate sums of money because the 'scope of work' is not within the boundaries of the original warranty agreement. This of course is not true. Toshiba is simply trying to force the added costs of warranty repairs down the throats of uninformed customers. Their laptops are cheap, but they won't actually save you any money in the long run.Save your money. Don't buy Toshiba. Consider any laptops made by Toshiba as being purely disposable, or built for third word countries with no consumer protection laws.", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Problems with screen going red", "Author": "Catherine Owenby", "ReviewID": "R1BS0AHLG9BIL4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Although the laptop appeared to be in new condition it has continually had problems with the screen switching to red.

If the unit was found wanting then I would get a full refund. Otherwise, they would charge a restocking fee and refund the rest.It is entirely the word of their tech.
