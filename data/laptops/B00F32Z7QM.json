Everyone was comparing this to the Lenovo Yoga which retailed for 500 more dollars than this laptop.  I personally think that is crazy!!  It's like taking a ford focus and comparing it to a lexus, of course the lexus is going to be better!!  But, for what it is, I am extremely happy with my purchase!!!This is one of the few laptops that I found that has an i7 and a removable battery.  I don't travel a lot but, when I do, I like the idea of being able to switch out the batteries.  An even worse thought with laptops with non-replaceable batteries, is that in a couple of years, when the battery life gets really short and I have to replace it, having to send it in to the company and spending a hundred dollars to replace the battery.  With this laptop, all I have to do is replace it and spend the 40 bucks on a new battery.The laptop itself seems well built, great battery life and is extremely fast!!  I have 0 complaints about it!!  Lenovo did a great job with this computer!!  I know the screen doesn't fold back all the way like it does with the Yoga but, for a majority of us, I bet it's not needed.  I for one, hate holding at tablet through a movie, or on a plane.  This computer is nice, bend it back, set it in front of me and I can use the touch screen with ease!!What really surprised me about this computer was how great the speakers sound.  I for one, have always bought cheap laptops so I don't have to worry about them but, this thing sounds amazing!!  I like to play music from my computer and I have never experienced that before!!  Even my online school classes sound louder and clearer than ever before!!!To sum it up, if you are looking for a great laptop for playing a few games, doing work/schoolwork or just to have a laptop this is great!!  If you are looking for the yoga or a yoga like experience, buy a yoga.", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good for the Price - Advanced users beware", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3KRMO38TPPMJA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good computer.Needs some adjustment to work properly (turn off adaptive brightness in power management)If not, you maybe think the display is broken (going dark to bright and bright to dark all the time).Pros:Good cost/benefit relation.Cons:Poor display, poor viewing angle, poor brightness.No gigabit LAN.No dual band WIFINo HDD led.No antiglare/mate display.No SSD Drive (its hybrid, normal HDD with SS cache).Based in web reviews, this computer has blacklisted HDD and WIFI adapter.

I use some not too heavy engineering programs, such as AutoDesk DWG TrueView, and it runs pretty smoothly.Sure I had to do some Windows 8 cleaning (just browse the web, you'll find how to), but every new computer needs it! I'm pretty happy with my purchase.I just don't rate it as 5 stars because the screen brightness was flickering for no reason (there were no changes in the ambience lighting), but it seems to be solved after I updated the video driver.", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Sexy", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "REPKW0KHKOXLI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's just sexy. I'm writing this review from it right now. Every morning, I share a cup of coffee with Lisa, my Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 15.6-Inch Ultrabook. We laugh together, go to class together, and even sleep in the same room. Things between Lisa and I have gotten very serious recently. I simply touch her to turn her on. I know they say money can't buy happiness, but Lisa is different. She's one in a trillion and nothing can break us apart; well, except when the Wi-Fi is down (but we all know that happens once a month).", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "So far, so good!", "Author": "Sonia", "ReviewID": "RQ0ZX1ANHJ8KJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this laptop couple of days ago and let me tell you; my first impression was it was all talk but not practical but I was proved wrong! It's the best computer I think I've ever had. This is not my first Windows 8 laptop so I didn't have the that learning curve to deal with. The keyboard is smooth and soft. It really is one of the best keyboards I've used in a while. I'm still getting used to the large screen (It's a 15, but I am used to my old 11 inch screen!) It really seems larger then a normal 15 inch, but only by a bit. Which is not bad, it makes watching video and playing games that much better! It's fast, long battery life and has a touch screen, which i find very useful! This laptop has everything!The flip feature on this is awesome. I use it when watching TV or Videos for a long time or reading blogs/news. It lets the screen become closer to me and not get in the way. Even though the hinges are very study I am still nervous about them. I break things VERY easily, I got an Accidental Warranty on just in case. I don't think anything will happen too it but I'd rather be safer than sorry.Some people come about the screen flickering. It's an easy fix of just turning off the auto brightness. Personally it hasn't bothered me unless I sit in one place on the couch then it tends to flicker a bit more (It's right in front of a window). I think it is a cool thought, but may not be practical. Again, easy fix.Lastly, with any computer you have to delete some programs. (Came pre-installed with McAfee, ewwww),  On my laptop the '1/!' button popped up, I just pushed it back down and popped it in and it was fine, totally not sure what that was about.", "Date": "March 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very Sleek & Stylish", "Author": "chidambaram adaikappan", "ReviewID": "RP90L0508XTYA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Its very Sleek & stylish...I love watching videos on that...the 300 degree rotation is very good for watching videos & for touchscreen..i just love it.", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "I really like the computer", "Author": "Bruce \"unhappy customer\"", "ReviewID": "R3R8J73HC6ZL82", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like the computer and the ability to change how the screen is presented.

There's no button and you have to press really HARD on the bottom corners to make it click. It's way too deep and sometimes it sticks. On my other laptops, even if there's no button it's not that annoying. Also if you are not right in front of the screen, the colors get darker.I was surprised with the keyboard. I thought it would be cheap, but it's quite good. Also I really like the design and the way you can use it as a tablet. I really use this feature. The touchscreen is responsive and it works really well with windows 8.If you plan to upgrade it with a SSD, be careful when you open the chassis. It's really complicated and it could be more simple like on other laptops. You have to unscrew everything and 2 screws are hidden under plastic things to lift it up. It took me ages to find them and it's not in the manual. Those 2 plastic things are glued so they don't stick anymore. I will have to add more glue before I lose them.The good news is that there is no sticker that will void the warranty if you open the chassis. It's a big pro.For my budget, it was the best laptop I could get. I'm really happy with it.", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00F32Z7QM"}}
