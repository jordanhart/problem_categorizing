{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Performance and style without compromise - proving once again that you get what you pay for", "Author": "The Bee Bee \"BB\"", "ReviewID": "R1R3WUZ8CT60FZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When it comes to laptops, I'm at a point in my career when I am no longer willing to compromise in terms of performance and style. That mindset costs me a little more in terms of the purchase price of a new machine, but when I consider that I usually keep a laptop a minimum of two years, then the premium I pay for a truly state-of-the-art laptop like the Toshiba KIRAbook 13 is about $1 a day more than a model with weaker specs and FAR less style. To me, that's the definition of \"affordable luxury\" and given how many hours of use my laptop gets, it's well worth it.I had an opportunity to test both KIRAbook 13 touchscreen models--the i5 and the i7--before deciding which one to go with. On paper, the differences are negligible. The KIRAbook 13 i5 has a 3rd gen Intel i5 processor and the regular version of Windows 8. The KIRAbook 13 i7 has a 3rd gen Intel i7 processor and Windows 8 Pro. If you're not hung up on processor specs, or need the few incremental features of Windows 8 Pro, then save yourself $200 and go with the quite-capable i5 model.My testing involved a number of real-world scenarios that relied on the software tools I use on a daily basis--the Microsoft Office 2013 suite, the Adobe CS6 suite (InDesign, Illustrator, Lightroom 4, and Photoshop primarily), and various other programs that are RAM and storage hogs. I also did a lot of testing of media files like streaming video, downloaded 1080p video files, super-high-resolution graphics files, and streaming radio and music. The media tests gave me a good idea of graphics throughput and the ability of the large 256Gb SSD to perform when massive amounts of data were being written to the disk. The final set of tests were benchmark tests designed to see how well the hardware performed in real life vs. rated speeds published by the manufacturers of specific components.I'm not a big fan of wordy, highly technical performance reviews like the ones you might find on Tom's Hardware, so here's what I learned - in plain English:Processor performance: The i7 is definitely faster in terms of the benchmark scores, but the real-world difference is negligible unless you're using industrial strength software like Photoshop or InDesign. Those programs are going to tax any processor, and you will definitely notice a meaningful speed boost when you're driving the i7 KIRAbook. For me, that kind of performance bump alone is worth the extra $200.SSD performance: Incredible. The KIRAbook throughput is faster than any SSD-based machine I have used, and is as good as anything on the market. Boot time is awesome, as is awake from sleep (one word: instantaneous).Graphics performance: Also incredible. The Toshiba KIRAbook has the highest resolution display of ANY Windows laptop and it is absolutely STUNNING! Anybody who works with spreadsheets or programs with tons of toolbars (like the Adobe CS6 applications) will LOVE the expansive real estate you get with that display. Watching a movie is a joy, as well, and I would offer that once you've experienced a 1080p movie on the KIRAbook display, you will absolutely hate having to watch one on any other laptop.In terms of head-to-head testing, the machines are nearly identical in every meaningful way. The i7 is faster in certain applications, and Windows 8 Pro does have legitimate incremental value for power users and those who work in corporate environments. Aside from that, the two machines are identical twins.For me, the real test wasn't i7 machine vs. i5 machine, it was Toshiba KIRAbook vs. the competition. I have a background in graphic design and product development, and how a machine looks and feels is as important as what's under the hood--sometimes more so. Toshiba really nailed the design of the KIRAbook. Sure, it's as light as a feather compared to most laptops AND ultrabooks, but I'm not as concerned about engineering feats as I am about what the machine feels like in my hands, and how it looks on a conference room table next to my colleagues' machines. In this regard, the KIRAbook kicked a**. No matter where I used one of these laptops, people would come up and want to see it and try it--particularly that Retina-quality touchscreen. I love it when a device I own elicits a response like that, and I can assure you that that alone is worth the extra $1 a day it will cost you to own the sexiest computing device on the market.The Toshiba KIRAbook 13 i5 and i7 models are BOTH fantastic performers and genuine head turners.

The left side has the power input, two USB 3.0 ports, a charging indicator light, and the HDMI port. The right side has a single USB port, the headset port, and a slot that holds an SD card. The keyboard area has the touchpad, an illuminated power button, and a small WiFi indicator light. The front and rear have nothing at all. The bottom has dual speakers, a couple of small feet so that the dual speakers can be heard, and a cooling fan.Setup:The setup is very simple; Toshiba includes a small booklet, plus some cards that show how to navigate in Windows 8 with either touch or a mouse. For those with more questions, it comes with Platinum setup service that has phone assistance. The only issue I had is that the device really expects you to have WiFi to set up; this is part of Microsoft's implementation of Windows 8, where you really are expected to log in on line. That isn't a problem for home users, but for business use don't expect to be able to plug in a TCP/IP-to-USB device until after set up is complete. Toshiba highly recommends completely finishing all setup actions before installing add-ons. I used the WiFi router built into my phone.Use:This laptop is truly outstanding for Windows 8 computing. The touch screen is sensitive (but not too much so), and everything moves quickly and snappily. Typing is great; there is no sag to the keyboard at all, the touch indicators on the F and J keys are well done, and the keys feel nice when touch typing. Due to the extremely high resolution on a 13.3 inch screen, some of the toolbars in various programs are fairly small. Fortunately, Toshiba provides a utility that changes the size of the menu text, and that helps a lot. But on some programs (like Firefox), the toolbar icons will be small. This won't be a problem on Windows 8 applications; only desktop programs.Battery Time:A lot of the battery time depends on the computer settings and how it is used. For my test I used the default settings, which include just under 50% screen brightness. I made use of the computer for word processing primarily, so the screen was on pretty much continuously. In this use the battery lasts about 4.5 hours. Note that the default mode has full speed on the processor, memory, and SSD (so there are some savings available to increase time). On \"eco\" mode I would expect about 6 hours based on the energy savings created by that mode. Conversely, if you crank up the screen brightness and play games or videos, I would expect only about 3.5 hours. I plan to use this for business, and this level of battery is fine. It would also be sufficient for most college classes on a typical day, but one might need that charger at the library for the evening studies. It should be noted that the time estimates are not accurate (they assume about 6 hours of time on a full battery). Perhaps those estimates will get better. I'll update the review if these battery times change.Pro:+ Good overall performance numbers. The Windows Experience Index is 5.6 due to the graphics card. Other scores: Processor 6.9, RAM 7.4, gaming graphics 6.3, hard disk 8 (a perfect score!).+ Cool and quiet operation.+ Beautiful 2560 X 1440 screen. It does a great job of showing pictures and movies. The text is very crisp. I had to use the Toshiba utility to increase the text sizes in order to make the screen text readable (it is very small by default) - Windows indicates the increase is 200% of normal.+ Very snappy in MS Office 2013, using the trial version that comes ready to be activated.+ It includes a free 2 year subscription to Norton Internet Security, Norton Anti-Theft, and 25 Gb of online storage.+ Includes copies of Adobe Photoshop Elements 11 (photos) and Adobe Premiere Elements 11 (videos). Both are desktop applications.+ Windows 8 software: Skype, Vimeo (video sharing), Netflix, and Huluplus.+ Three USB 3.0 ports.+ Brushed aluminum body - beautiful and sturdy.+ USB drives can be set to provide power when the computer is asleep (for charging phones and etc).+ Full sized HDMI output, excellent for porting the video out to a TV.+ The device includes a 2 year \"Platinum\" warranty with 24/7 technical support, set-up assistance, annual tune-up, and gloal emergency assistance. It even comes with a credit card sized warranty card.+ Backlit keyboard for dark computing. It turns on and off with FN+Z.+ Excellent for typing, with a good touch and an almost full sized keyboard.+ Snappy 256 Gb SSD. The drive is excellent, and that amount of storage should suffice for most business users. The SD card slot can provide up to 128Gb more via SDXC cards. Due to the backup partitions and installed applications, there is about 185 Gb of space actually available listed by Windows.+ Eco-mode capability, which reduces energy use by 40% or so, and can be adjusted.+ Toshiba includes a special battery mode that will not charge the battery past 80%. This is intended to provide longer battery life, especially for those who keep the laptop connected to the power adapter a lot.+ The webcam includes video stabilization.+ Audio customized by harman/kardon. As noted elsewhere, it is great with headphones, but only adequate for internal speakers.+ The touchpad emulates the Windows 8 swipe actions. For example, one can swipe in from the right of the touchpad to bring up the charms menu. It is a bit difficult to close items with the touchpad, but it is simple to do charms or the task manager. Well done.+ The included charger is a mini brick, and the brick part itself is the smallest I've seen. This is great for storage.Con:- The internal speakers are a bit tinny. Headset output is excellent.- There seem to be an inordinate amount of Toshiba utilities (12 programs are shown in the control panel).- The laptop comes with a program called PC Health Monitor installed - it collects lots of data and sends it to Toshiba. The only way to disable it is by uninstalling. However nothing is listed by that name in the control panel \"Remove Programs\". At least the manual makes it clear that it is collecting lots of information. I believe this information is used to help Toshiba find better ways to improve their laptops, but it does raise some privacy issues.- One cannot make a backup media from the internal SD card slot (this may be a Windows 8 issue).- Touching the screen does not really work unless near the base of the screen- the entire display moves backwards. So swiping down is often a two handed (or wobbly) affair.- The laptop is expensive. One can find ultra portables for less money - but probably not as nice in the little details of construction.- For an ultra portable device (at at this price point), a GPS module might have been useful.- The camera is only .9 megapixels. It is adequate for video conferencing and not much more.- I think they would have done better to put the speakers on the top of the device rather than underneath. They cannot be heard well except on a hard surface.- The estimated battery remaining is very optimistic. I found that if the computer went to sleep, the calculation started creeping upwards (obviously the computer adds in the time, even though the device was not awake). It seemed to settle somewhat after a few minutes, but I would not trust the estimate for accuracy. This is in line with other computers I have seen running Windows 8.Value for the Price:This model uses the I5 processor, which provides a balance of good speed and power consumption. There is an I7 version for an additional amount if one really needs more speed, but I found this one to be quite sufficient for my computing needs. However, in many ways the touch screen is really unnecessary. I did not find myself touching the screen (except when I first used it, for the novelty). For a device with no \"tablet\" mode, there really isn't much point to a touch screen. The keyboard is always present, and the touchpad is closer to the hands when typing than reaching up to use the touch screen - and it is more accurate. Microsoft produced what is basically a tablet and phone operating system in Windows 8, and this ultraportable shows up the fact that touch is not really useful in a device with a full time keyboard. (I'm not attempting to criticize or review Windows 8, and Toshiba was basically forced to include this OS, but it is relevant to the decision on which laptop to buy). In my opinion, if you really want the great characteristics of this model, you would be better served by ordering the same model without the touch screen. It is hundreds of dollars cheaper and I don't think most users will find the touch screen that useful. I installed Classic Shell, which restores the start menu and bypasses the Windows 8 menus, because at this point I will be using mostly desktop applications anyway. With this sort of add on installed, it is basically the same as Windows 7 unless one pops back into the Windows 8 menus.Summary: A beautiful screen and silky smooth computing experience. If you can afford the cost and your computing needs fit into this battery life, this is a wonderful ultra portable. But check out the non touch screen model as well before buying. Highly recommended.UPDATE February 2014: Since I wrote this, touch screen prices have gone down, this ultra high resolution screen is not readily available on other models, and the price of this model has gone down. I would now say that this model is now more affordable (if still a bit expensive).", "Date": "May 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome!  Don't be afraid to retire your old laptop", "Author": "I Do The Speed Limit", "ReviewID": "R1C39ZX7YK0414", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Human nature being what it is, there must be lots of people out there like me:  I resist change.  Therefore, the night before I was to receive this laptop in the mail, I lay awake for a few hours worrying about how hard it would be to let go of the comfort of my old laptop.  Obviously, I had already made the decision to upgrade, but I worried nonetheless.  Would I like the touchscreen?  Would my older eyes be able to deal with the smaller screen?  Will the Norton security software (already installed) work with my internet connectivity problems at my home location?  What about Windows 8?  And, until I opened up the box and took a look at this beautiful piece of equipment, I continued to baulk.  Obviously, from what I've already admitted and questioned, you can tell I'm not a computer wiz.  I'm not afraid of computers and things electronic, but you could say I'm not totally aware of the most current electronic technology available and how to use it.  So, if you are like me, keep on reading--I'll try to convince you that this is the laptop to buy.  If you are looking for a review with a lot of technical commentary, you might want to save yourself some time and pass this one by.Bottom line is this:  I'm very glad I upgraded to this laptop.  All of my fears have faded away.  The more I use it, the more I love it, love it, love it.  Can you see me hopping up and down in excitement, with a big grin on my face?The touchscreen on this baby is so helpful and very easy to use.  It is user-friendly and your common-sense responses will aid you.  I can fly to the bottom of a page in a blink of an eye.  I can move things around, and twist them.  Immediately, I can enlarge the screen to see small type or a tiny item in a picture.  The touchscreen is responsive and accurate.  If can be used in conjunction with a mouse (And that is what I'm doing now, until I gain more confidence and experience.).The size of the screen is not an issue because the touchscreen has the zoom feature. Because of the zoom feature, this screen size actually works better than a larger screen.Besides the touchscreen, I also find the backlit keyboard to be immensely helpful.  How did I ever do without it?  If I only consider the touchscreen and back-lighted keyboard:  I will never go back to my old laptop again, except to transfer files.The sharpness and brightness of the screen is amazing.  The control panel allows for even more adjusting if necessary.  The clarity and the contrast seems to allow my eyes to focus on even smaller size type that on my old laptop.The sound is rich and full; almost as good as what is produced by a pair of Bose speakers.  Great for listening to music.  Be aware that the speakers are on the sloped underside of the laptop, which means that it should be kept on a flat surface.  It is not recommended that you use it on a bed or cushion or on you lap.  If you must use it on a soft surface you should probably get yourself a riser.A few words on the Intel i5 processor:  What is the difference between i5 and i7?  From what I've researched online, a \"normal\" user will very seldom, if ever, need to tap into the extra power the i7 provides.  So far, I've not noticed any difference between the speed of the i5 and the i7.  If you do a lot of sophisticated, detailed work with a lot of data, or use an intricate or elaborate software program, or if you just want to buy the best there is, you might go the extra $200 or so for the i7.  (For instance, if I wanted to install a Primavera software product on a laptop, I would choose the i7.  Engineers and Designers might also consider the i7 if they have thoughts about taking work home.)  The i7 also allows you to connect your personal computer to your work or school network, and it runs Windows Pro (which is a $80 upgrade at this time). Otherwise this i5 model should be way more than adequate.The graphics card is also top-of-the-line.Last, but definitely not least, the Platinum Service and Support is TLC for a person like me--someone not quite up to speed on the latest technology.  I can get quick, expert help whenever I need it.  It kind of feels like having an AMEX black card...One extra FYI:  If you don't want to, or can't, part with your CDs and DVDs, you will need to purchase an external drive.Like I said before:  The more I use this laptop, the more I love it.  Even in a relatively short period of time, I already feel that it is part of me.  Who could ask for more?

Hopefully this can get resolved.2) The scaling in some programs and windows is screwed up with the high screen resolution.

It is elegant looking with a streamlined shape, rounded corners and a magnesium alloy outer case with a brushed aluminum color finish. It comes with 8GB of DDR3 RAM, a 2.0-GHz Intel Core i5-3337U processor and a 256 GB hard drive. There are 3 USB ports, an HDMI, and an SD card slot. It has a backlit keyboard, a large touchpad and a touch screen. With the Windows 8 OS, I found it to be a blend between a tablet and a laptop.TOUCHPAD: I tried using only the touchpad and no mouse but found it to be unresponsive at times. Often the arrow pointer wouldn't go where I wanted it to and it got a little frustrating fiddling around with it. In the end, if I needed to be productive and precise, I used a mouse. If I was just checking my mail, the touchpad was fine.KEYBOARD: The backlit keyboard is flat and a change from what I'm accustomed to but it was easy to adjust to it. The keys have just enough contouring to make typing easy.TOUCHSCREEN: The touchscreen is nice for scrolling the screen up, down and side to side. Using either my finger or a stylus worked equally well. I like the stylus because it's a little more precise than my finger and I was afraid hands would leave prints, however that didn't happen. The screen is fingerprint resistant and it does stay clean. The hinge on the laptop is firm enough that the screen stayed steady while I poked and tapped at it.SCREEN DISPLAY: The display is incredibly sharp with vivid colors. With a resolution of 2560 x 1440, the look is stunning. My photos look fantastic. Only one problem, with such a high resolution the text on some of the applications (in my case, Photoshop) can get too tiny. I could barely read the text on the menu bar. Also, precise navigation becomes impossible without the mouse. I tried changing the resolution and this did make the text larger, but I didn't like the way the laptop looked once I went back to the desktop or the internet browser so I had to change it back.PERFORMANCE: Boot-up time is about 5 or 6 seconds. This is fantastic for someone like me who was previously using a WinXP system that took forever to load. The processor is fast and powerful and the wi-fi performed flawlessly working in all rooms of my house and outdoors with no dropped connections. The laptop runs quiet with little to no noise from the fan. I used it on a desk and on my lap. The fan is on the bottom and I thought there might be a problem with heat but there wasn't and the temperature stayed comfortable.BATTERY: I am getting close to six hours life on the battery with normal use. I allowed it to go into power-saving mode and I wasn't playing any video games. I did find that an increased demand on the system will result in less battery life. I used the notebook outside one afternoon and had to dramatically increase the screen brightness. This decreased battery life by 25 - 30%. The software will warn you that battery life decreases at that brightness level but it is necessary to run it on high in order to see the screen in the daylight.SOFTWARE: This model ships with Windows 8, Adobe Photoshop Elements 11 and Adobe Premiere Elements 11 plus an assortment of pre-loaded apps such as Skype, Netflix and Hulu. Also included are two years of Norton Internet Security, Anti-Theft and Online back-up. Two years is a great deal. Kirabook also comes with 24/7 support and US based customer service reps plus a limited 2yr warranty. Again, another great feature.DRAWBACKS: In order to achieve an ultra portable design there are few things that are understandably missing. There is no optical drive and the hard drive is only 256 GB. This is plenty of storage for most people but still a limited size. There is no ethernet adapter and you are limited to a 2.4GHz WiFi connection. The fan and speakers are on the bottom of the case.CONCLUSION: This is a gorgeous laptop but it comes with a steep price tag aimed at the luxury and must-have market. If you can afford it and don't mind the few drawbacks, this is the ultimate in laptops.This is one of those times I wish there was a half-star rating because this is more than 4 stars but not quite 5 star perfect. 4\u00bd Stars.", "Date": "June 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Would be a perfect machine at $400 less - comparing against Zenbook Touch and Chromebook Pixel", "Author": "ScOObydoo", "ReviewID": "R1IDQ29WLD3AIC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "To review the Kirabook, you are best off starting without knowing the price, because once you see it, you'll question everything about this machine.Lets start with the basics - this version is one of three different Kirabook models - the base is an i5, 256GB SSD and 8GB of ram with a 2560 x 1440 pixel non-touch display.Next up is the same machine, but with a touch screen as reviewed here - core i5 at 1.8GHz, 256GB SSD, 8GB and touch screen. At $1799, it is  one of the more expensive Windows 8 machines out there, without getting into Workstation or rugged models. The top of the line has the same specs, but swaps the Core i5 for a Core i7 at 3.1GHz.The Kirabook does come with a premium package of extras - 2 years of warranty, concierge service, relatively bloat-free, Adobe Photoshop Elements, Premiere Elements and a suite of Norton. Unlike most other machines, these are all FULL versions without any \"trial\" nags.In the box is another box with the actual laptop, a cheap looking AC charger and an assortment of quick start guides and a warranty card.So - lets go through the machine itself before comparing to its competition:On the outside, I have to say that the Toshiba just isn't all that striking. It looks like a cheap HP DM series. The chrome trim is just tacky, and the machine would look much better without it. Ports on the left include power, USB and HDMI. On the right is one more USB port, multi-audio in/out and an SD card slot. It does feel well made, there is no flex in the keyboard and the case is certainly not the usual squeaky mess you'll find on a $300 machine. Sadly, the SD card slot is not \"full depth\", so any cards in it will stick out, making it impossible to keep a card in it when traveling. There is a single LED showing the charger status on the left, but no HDD or power LEDS anywhere.On the inside things are a bit better - the keyboard is backlit and of MUCH better quality than recent Toshibas (like the Z935). The trackpad is a single slab (Synaptics) and also lacks the horrid buttons of the recent Portege.The screen is definitely the highlight of this machine - it is the first Windows laptop with a 2560 x 1440 pixel display (the Chromebook Pixel with the first computer with one). Yes - the screen is amazing, but Windows just isn't made for the resolution. Most things look ok (like the Metro interface), but other apps don't know what to do with the resolution. Chrome looks blurry, other apps show the text in the tiniest size you've ever seen. This inconsistent experience actually becomes annoying.Bottom line - amazing screen, but there just isn't much you can do with it. Unlike the iPad, there are no Windows app specifically designed for \"retina\" style screens.Performance on the i5 model is acceptable. Windows 8 is certainly at home on the i5, and even with some of the pre-installed apps opened (like Photoshop Elements), it never slows down or shows any signs of sluggishness. Unlike the higher powered i7 version, the i5 machine doesn't heat up as fast. With heavy use, the fan won't come on full speed until about 20 minutes into using it. On the bottom is a fan / jet engine. Without exaggerating, when the fan comes on, it actually sounds like the jet whine you'd expect from a plane. It is so loud, that it drowns out music when the volume is set to 50%. Also, the fan is on the bottom, so if you use it on your lap, bed or other soft object, the heat can't escape - there are no side vents.The machine has Bluetooth, but only basic WiFi using a pretty basic Intel Centrino N2230 adapter (which means no 5GHz wifi). For a premium machine, it really should come with dual band WiFi. The WiFi does support the Intel Wireless Display system, but that involves investing an additional $75-$100 in a WiDi adapter. The end result is not bad, but wireless display is certainly a niche.Display performance is fine - the machine definitely won't be a gamers dream, but desktop apps are not going to slow down due to the Intel graphics.Also, the speakers are touted as \"Harman Kardon\", but they really are just basic - they are down-facing, so place the machine on a bed or sofa, and the sound is gone. Little to no bass.But the biggest issue (and why it gets four stars instead of five) is that it just feels like Toshiba didn't go all the way here. Lets compare:Chromebook Pixel - comes in a gorgeous box with a very slick compact power adapter with cord that wraps around it. The machine feels amazing from well machined aluminum.Zenbook Touch - same well designed power brick, screen wipe, carrying pouch, Ethernet to USB adapter, MicroVGA adapterToshiba Kirabook - decently designed box, very cheap power brick (same one as used on their other machines) - and that is IT.There is no Ethernet port on the machine, so you will need to buy one if you need it, and there is no case included. For a machine so heavily geared towards its design, it really should come with a simple slip cover.And finally, there is the price - the base model touch i5 reviewed here is $1799, which is $400 more than the Chromebook Pixel (which has a miserable 32GB HDD and of course runs Chrome), and also $400 more than a Zenbook Prime Touch (which has lower ram/SSD on that model). Still, most people do not need the high resolution screen of the Kirabook. Amazingly, the Core i5 Kirabook is actually priced around the same as the similarly spec'd Apple Macbook Air 13\" - considered one of the more overpriced machines on the market.Other things to keep in mind - this machine can't be upgraded, so what you get is what you will need to live with, but with the specs out of the box, you should be fine. The pre-installed software leaves about 184GB free of the 256GB SSD. Boot time is in the seconds - so they clearly used a speedy SSD inside. The machine has a standard HDMI port, so you don't need any expensive Displayport adapters. It lacks a fingerprint reader option, and even though the USB ports are black, they are USB 3.0 (most USB 3.0 ports are blue), but this is a nice touch to blend in.And finally, unlike every other Windows 8 machine I've used, this one boots up and makes you connect with a local account instead of starting with a Microsoft account, so you'll need to switch that out if you want the full Windows 8 sync options.Bottom line - it is definitely one of the nicest machines Toshiba has ever made, some of the highest specs on the market, but about $400 too expensive for what you get. If you have the money, you won't be disappointed, as long as you don't remind yourself every day how much you spent on it.", "Date": "May 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Smoking Fast!!!!", "Author": "T.

Those are the laptops my wife would inherit.This time she finally got a new one.  A new one that is smoking fast, light to carry, and has a touch screen.  She has an iPad so she likes being able to touch the screen and have it react to her touch instead of just leaving a smudge.She likes the Adobe Photoshop Elements 11 and Adobe Premiere Elements 11 software that came with it and is already using it to create a scrapbook of our trip to Bonaire.She loves the start up speed and the battery life has been great.The one and only thing she does not like is Windows 8.  Like most people that have used it she finds it confusing and would like to see the scrolling start menu gone.  Other than that she loves it.All in all this is a great laptop for the price!!!", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Ultrabook", "Author": "Waffleater1", "ReviewID": "R35XUL3Y2XIIZX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I won't make this a long review, because I agree with the other 5 star reviews on here. The laptop itself is really well designed. It feels incredibly sturdy but is also very light and thin. I walk around the house carrying it on one hand while typing on the other hand, it's that portable.The keys are a bit shallow compared to a \"normal\" big laptop or an external keyboard, but I got used to it pretty fast. I'm a college students and write a lot of essays on this machine, and have no complaints at all. Keys are well located, a very usable size, easy to type on and once again the whole machine feels super stable.The included warranty basically mimics AppleCare, which is a big compliment. Especially because you get it for free. My power charger died without notice, and I called the (dedicated) Kirabook line and they shipped me a new one overnight for free. No questions asked.The laptop itself is fast (8GB of Ram obviously helps) and responsive. It very rarely runs into performance issues, although it does tend to overheat. My only gripe would be that the small fan on the bottom of the laptop isn't large enough to properly cool down the machine under a heavy load, so watching 1080p video on here without speakers or headphones is a bit annoying because it sounds like a vaccum cleaner. Under moderate use, the fan is completely silent though.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "A Bit Pricey", "Author": "booksy", "ReviewID": "R2JU76OKC1QSWB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This laptop has some really nice features and so far I like it. I'm going to make a list of the pros and cons that I have experienced with it so far.Pros:Small and lightweight, yet stable and easy to use the touch screenThe screen is truly gorgeous and the touch features work greatIt was relatively easy to set upComes with a full two-year warranty that looks really good. You can call them for setup assistance but I didn't need it.The touchpad is pretty sensitive and works wellHas a lot of RAMIt doesn't come with tons of extra junk (though it does have Photoshop Elements, a nice touch)The battery lasts a decent amount of time (4+ hours?)Cons:It's hard to open! It feels like prying open a pistachio and required two hands.It runs a little bit loudThe hard drive is not very bigAt first, whenever I opened this laptop, I couldn't automatically connect to my network. I thought it was a problem with the computer itself, but it was actually a setting in Windows 8 that did not automatically open any hidden networks. I had to tell it to look for hidden networks and then it was fine.This machine comes with Windows 8 which may or may not be what you want. My last PC OS was Vista, and this is definitely a change for me. It took a couple of days for me to find my way around the screens, but once I did, I found myself using the touch screen as much as the keyboard. I really liked the touch screen capability.So is this computer worth it? Frankly, I think it's a little over-priced, especially the way that it's so hard to open. It makes it feel like they skimped. I have an old Macbook that opens instantly and I never even had to think about that function, but I definitely notice it on this one. I think they spent most of their money on the beautiful screen and the extra RAM and SSD hard drive. Those are definitely great features. This computer seems tailor-made for Windows 8, so if you like that and are used to having a tablet or are interested in the touch screen and want fantastic resolution, then it would probably be worth it.", "Date": "May 23, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,799.99", "Features": "Intel Core i5-3337U Processor 1.8 GHz (up to 2.7 GHz, 3 MB Cache)\n8 GB DDR3 RAM\n256 GB Solid-State Drive\n13.3-Inch Screen, Mobile Intel\u00ae HD graphics\nWindows 8, 6.16-hour battery life", "Name": "Toshiba KIRAbook 13 i5 Touchscreen Laptop", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41fEzJqSSOL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BM1PX08"}}
