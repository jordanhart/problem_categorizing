Mine performs excellently, and came with Windows 7 Professional installed as promised.It arrived promptly and was well-packaged.The current price ($517) is excellent for a computer with a relatively fast processor as well as upgraded ram and, best of all, a 7200rpm hard drive: those can be pretty hard to find on inexpensive laptops. If you custom build a E545 at the Lenovo website with these same specs, it will cost substantially more than $517.Lenovo makes a fine product. Prior to this I used a T500 Thinkpad; the hinges finally gave out after about five years of heavy use, but the performance remains good. The E545 takes the same charger as the T400 and T500, which is very convenient.", "Date": "May 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "E545", "Author": "Dominick Falzano", "ReviewID": "R21SX0IVYEGS4P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything I wanted in  portable, fairly priced, delivered ahead schedule.

The computer itself is a beauty and I am loving it! I love the matte textured surface, so no fingerprints to clean off. It doesn't get hot on my lap, it's very quiet, and very expensive looking. I've only had it for 10 days now, so still haven't explored all its features, but I just had to leave a review so more people could know about it.", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "I am picky about my laptops, but I really like my T530", "Author": "C. McNamara", "ReviewID": "R1DZ2N6XZ0CWCN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a Lenovo R500 for many years, and loved how it worked, but it was an XP machine and I wanted to upgrade to Windows 7.I struggled to find a laptop that did not have a numeric keypad - the keypad is a waste of space for me, and it forces the touchpad to be on the left side of the laptop, which makes it awkward when trying to drag and drop items, e.g., an email into a certain email folder.I also struggled to find a laptop with a touchpad that had buttons on the bottom that I could use to hold down the clicker, while I dragged an item to a folder or highlighted certain text when word processing.  I dislike the touchpads that are one entire platform that has you using trial and error to know if you're pushing down on the left side or the right side of the touch -- I wanted a button that would distinctly tell me which side I was on.The Lenovo T530 has all of that.  It was easy to install.  Unfortunately, Lenovo no longer produces this model.  But I wanted to share how much I liked the laptop anyway :-)", "Date": "April 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nothing is perfect, yet many things are excellent.  This one is excellent.", "Author": "stephen paul kendall", "ReviewID": "R1NY97T1KE10ZE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good sounding audio, screen display is sufficient, bright and clear, keyboard feels good to use, battery lasts a long time +5 hours, style is nice and for my first laptop, I couldn't be more pleased.  I would recommend this computer to everyone.  I hope to enjoy it for years to come.  I don't know why anyone would buy a used computer when for this very low and reasonable price could have a great new one with warranties.  I will seek and look harder from now on to find new computers at such low prices and let others take their chances with second hand and worn-out ones.", "Date": "April 20, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00HJB9Z1I"}}
