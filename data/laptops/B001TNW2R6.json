Still working although I just replaced the OEM power cord with a cheap one from Amazon. Now it charges great and cosmetically it still looks and runs like new.Some people have had issues with the OEM power cord. Mine worked fine for about 4 yrs. but it became very inefficient and the 'brick' started getting way to hot, but all is good now that I replaced the original adapter.While the 700m is not as slick as my newer Apple MBP, Win XP Pro is still running fine and all my cool PC games are loaded on it so I hope it lasts 7 more years!A very lightweight notebook(even lighter than my old Sony VAIO) so it is easy to travel with.I own 2 batteries - the original and a 3rd party battery with longer capacity. The newer battery lasts about 4 hrs unless I watch DVDs and play games continuously. That runs it down in about 2 hrs.", "Date": "July 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "awesome small laptop!", "Author": "skb", "ReviewID": "R3M9XQLGBC7GFC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "all that needs to be said is if i could find another version of this laptop today, i would buy it again!  it is super compact, almost like a netbook, but still has a cd/dvd player.. which a lot of netbooks don't.i just bought a dell 14 to upgrade, but it just doesn't compare to my little 700m :(", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Older but It works", "Author": "AKR", "ReviewID": "R24XVARMGSAKMS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just purchased Dell's newest laptop XPS 15z, wonderful, thin, lots of goodcomponents...but, I can't get it onto my home wireless network. After a long,protracted and repitive discussion with a Dell tech, she wanted to sell mesome additional software because the new computer already had fragmentedfiles, etc. (it was diagnosed over the web). I had not even started loading myPhotoshop CS2, or any other programs.At the same time, my little, old, slow Inspiron 700m goes online (wireless),does the job albeit very slowly but it does it!I thought buying from Dell again would be good but it is just frustrating andtime consuming no matter the cost of the product!

Mowry", "ReviewID": "R1RXHHCCYWW96P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had this laptop for six years, it lasted me through college and grad school. It has a truly beautiful screen, and having a dvd-cd drive is really convenient. Between the optical drive, the nice display, and the faster processor I like this a lot better than my netbook.Sadly, the motherboard on mine fried after six years, and I am bereaved. It's been two months, and I'm seriously thinking of getting a second used one, because once you upgrade the RAM to have at least a gig then this is a really powerful machine for how small it is, and I've really missed that in my netbook even if the battery life is lacking in the Inspiron. (You'll have about half an hour for movies or games, though it can do about two hours of word processing on a new battery.)", "Date": "January 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Little Laptop ever!", "Author": "S. H. Jolly", "ReviewID": "R199ODK43YQWXP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought our 700M the year we were moving from New England to Florida (2006).  After moving a lot of stuff, including the big computer, to the new house in the winter of 2005/06, we returned north to pack up the rest of the household items.  The 700M came with us and was our \"only\" computer for almost 6 months.  We picked up a Kensington USB hub with ports for a parallel printer, an external monitor and a serial keyboard and mouse, and we used the laptop like a CPU for most of the time, connected directly to our cable internet provider.When the time came to hit the road, the laptop came with us and worked great with hotel hookups, cable, dial up and wi-fi.  Because of the small size (and light weight), the keyboard is a bit small for real fast typing and the screen is a bit small, but very clear and bright.  Now I am still using it for travel, and also for sitting on the patio or on the couch to read emails and surf the web.  It has all the features I have ever needed, plus plenty of computing power and storage. And it looks really cool!! I dread the day this little laptop dies...I don't know what I will replace it with, maybe an upscale netbook, if they are still around.", "Date": "January 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "You're not going to find a better WinXP notebook!", "Author": "Kenneth", "ReviewID": "R1RLKM5XFWRIL7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This notebook was really Dell's flagship \"small and light\" model when it debuted several years ago.

It costed over 1000$ back in 2004, but it still works perfectly almost 10 years after I bought it! When I dropped it hard  (I mean 3 feet high) years ago, it didn't suffer a scratch.In the meanwhile I upgraded the RAM with 1GB and installed Linux, because I mostly use it for internet, and it keeps doing the job. I wished every product had the quality this 700m had. I hope to keep using it for many more years, perhaps upgrading the RAM to 2GB if necessary.", "Date": "November 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Wendy Collins", "ReviewID": "R3W4E9DJQRPEQZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this machine so much I bought 2 more as gifts.

I picked this up several years ago when it had just come out and the thing works like a charm.  In my opinion this laptop blows my newer Inspiron 1318 out of the water.First off the computer is super light, you can stick it in your bag and take it wherever you want while not giving yourself major back pains.  Secondly the performance on this machine is awesome and it is very powerful.  I am able to run newer games such as Doom 3, Quake 4 and Resident Evil 4 on here without any problems or lockups.  Conversely my newer Inspiron 1318 which is supposed to be upgraded and more modern wont play ANY of these games.  This laptop is super fast, it is great for general use, school work, buisness and gaming.  Not only do I use it for gaming, I use it for research and projects for my graduate classes as well as for running my buisness.I only have 2 minor complaints about this computer.  The first is that the glossy screen does not work so well outside and the outdoor glare is a killer, but that is easily avoided by replacing the screen for a matte version.  Secondly the wireless card is not exactly the fastest at long range, but this can be easily avoided by getting a wireless expander or an addition pcie wireless card such as the one I use by NetGear.  This is a great windows XP computer, soon I am going to try to upgrade it to Windows 7, and if that works correctly than it is a wrap, i'll get a second one!!Just a warning, dont drop the computer too many times, since it is smaller, the screen is quite a bit more deliciate than most laptop screens, although the laptop is built like a tank, and god knows mine has taken a beating, the screen is a little delicate.  I dropped mine a cracked the LCD screen, but replacement parts for it are easy to find and the screen is super easy to install.  Secondly, you dont want to drop it too much becuase this model was one of the ones with the exploding batteries.  While mine did no such thing, there were stories of it happening but Dell has since replaced the batteries and offered all owners new batteries, so this should not be an issue, it is just a quick heads up.  (the battery only exploded if it was dropped and it fell on the battery).This had to be the best laptop I ever bought.  I got this when it was very expensive, and to see it on here for cheap is like a dream come true.  I have had mine going on almost 10 years now, and it is still kicking and has not stopped working!  When mine finally does decide to die, I am going to pick up another used one from here, that is how much I love this laptop.  Forget the new stuff, this one is great and a real workhorse! By the way, get the laptop here the price on here is amazing, I paid over $1000 for it when it first came out, and it was the best money I ever spent!", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "My second Dell Inspiron 700m", "Author": "Phil", "ReviewID": "R2DEVH0DCHE4SM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my first one maybe 5 years ago and now found an application for a second one on a different project. I don't need all of the bells and whistles, and its compactness is an asset. My only gripe is that with the first, the decals on 9 of the most frequently used keys had worn off and I had the keyboard replaced before the warranty expired.
