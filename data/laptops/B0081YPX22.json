The viewing angle on the screen is very limited. The laptop crashes about 50% of the time when I put it in sleep mode. And don't get me started about the quality of the touch pad: it's so bad that I have disabled it and connect an external USB mouse instead.I would recommend buying a real Macbook Air instead of this cheaply produced clone.", "Date": "November 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent procduct both quality and proformance", "Author": "MG", "ReviewID": "R1AWGV4W2TDM7Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Computer lives up to the hype.

The laptop arrived in a box with a handle, well-padded against impact, and with accompanying manuals and CDs. The latest drivers had already been installed (including touchpad drivers).I had a difficult time choosing between the Dell XPS 13 and the HP Folio 13, its closest (and worthy) rival. I am SO glad to have gone with my preference for better aesthetics, because the XPS 13 is simply beautiful. I like it even better than the MacBook Air, which I had been borrowing from my university's library. The keyboard - black and backlit - has soft keys that are well-spaced.I only have one complaint regarding usability. The first is touchpad buttons. The buttons are slightly stiff and loud; but then again, I'm comparing them to the soft buttons of a Dell Inspiron 1420, the model I used for 6 years.Overall, I love the XPS 13 for its ultra light weight (3 lbs), impressive aesthetic design, decent battery life, and good screen brightness. Students who may have been hankering for a MacBook Air might find the XPS to be a highly satisfying alternative.", "Date": "September 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "v. s.", "ReviewID": "R3AHEVCCXRP6GP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop for college, looking for something cheap and durable. After reading a few reviews online and getting the nod from my older brother, who was helping me pick it out, I decided to buy it here, mostly because this is the cheapest I found it. The machine is very lightweight--a plus since I'm a French horn player who has to carry her instrument around with her--and any issues I had with the mouse and keyboard just took a little getting used to. The screen was a little dark, but that was easily fixed when I turned up the brightness a notch. The buttons to play/pause/stop/etc. music and movies is really convenient, along with the volume control buttons. It came with Photoshop 9, too, which saves me the time of reinstalling CS2. Just some tips for potential buyers, though: It only comes with two USB ports (one on each side), so I would recommend buying one of those things that gives you 4+ extra ports if you need to plug in things. (These sell for about 2-3 dollars on Amazon, so it's not that much of a major investment.) It also doesn't have a DVD/CD drive, so if you want to use any sort of CD, you might want to buy an external DVD drive.My mum and her boyfriend were both really worried when it arrived (I was at my dad's for the weekend when it came) because the box came and it looked a little tattered, but we opened the box and it was protected very well (styrofoam, then a hard box that it came in, and then another very small amount of wrapping around it). It came very quickly, too--I ordered it on a Wednesday and it came on Saturday--but that may be because it was shipped from either New Jersey or Pennsylvania (I forget) and I live in the western area of New York.All in all, it's a great laptop, and the service was great when I ordered it. If I wound up buying a laptop again in the near future, this is probably where I'd buy it.", "Date": "August 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Satisfied with the laptop", "Author": "Grace Wills", "ReviewID": "R1L991DM1VJ6TO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have been having problems with the item.
