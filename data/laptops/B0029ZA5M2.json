It actually performs well for my needs. I have it on about 15 hours a day. It is still fast and does everything I need it to. I do not do any heavy gaming though, just web browsing, email, movies, music, online games like Pogo, etc.I paid 300 dollars for it brand new, on sale. It was an excellent laptop for the price, no doubt, as far as performance, but their are some build quality issues. The laptop around the battery area, on top and bottom gets super hot, super fast. The charger block gets very hot as well. The laptop would shut down on its own occasionally because it was overheating. This was not due to the fan being blocked or anything like that. The hottest part would be right at the area where the charger plugs in, which is on the left corner, by the hinge to open and close the laptop...Which brings me to my biggest issue with this laptop. About a year after owning it and getting multiple charging block/cord replacements, both by HP warranty replacements, as well as buying them on my own, one day the screen literally burst open on the left side by where the charger plugs in. So I was left with a laptop screen that is cracked open. The display still works, but I have to have it propped up against a wall, etc to use it. The hinge is completely busted and the framing around the screen just hangs open. I will upload a picture so you can see it. I have been using it this way still for awhile now. As I said, it still works perfectly fine, but the screen is just barely hanging on. Of course it was out of warranty period so HP would not help at all, even after knowing all the issues I had with it overheating and them sending me replacement parts numerous times.What I have ended up doing ever since the screen spontaneously combusted (lol) is remove the battery permanently and keep it plugged in nonstop. That totally rectified the overheating issue. It feels slightly warm at times at the charging area, but it is normal - not the super hot, burn my finger hot, that I used to experience.Other than that, it would have actually had a 5 star rating based on specs and price. I am still using it right now. I figure I will use it until it completely dies. I mean, it works, it's just not structurally sound as far as the screen is concerned. The battery life itself does leave a bit to be desired as well, but that didn't bother me so much really, because I am pretty much always near an outlet to charge it. You get about 40 minutes of use on a full charge.As far as specs, it is a great laptop for a student, or someone like me who isn't into hardcore games. It is fast enough and runs any program I need. I can run multiple programs at a time without having it slow down on me. My antivirus runs while im watching videos and it doesn't slow down on me. I typically have about 5 tabs open at any given time on my browser (as I write this there are 7) and I never have any problems. I can burn cd's while I play online games and it still runs fine.I haven't even looked at reviews to see if my issue is common or a fluke. If it weren't for the screen busting open, I would recommend it. I get the idea that HP/Compaqs on the lower price range like this aren't built to last and not much thought or quality goes into the battery/charging/overheating. It is a shame too because they are great budget priced laptops that do everything a typical, everyday user would want/need... until it bursts apart.", "Date": "October 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very poor AC adaptor design, repeatedly breaks !!", "Author": "Patrick Corley", "ReviewID": "R3UQIPIW490HYU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have always favoured Compaq Laptops. However, one silly design flaw can be really offputting. The AC / DC adaptor for this series of laptops keeps breaking because there is too much mechanical stress on the point where it plugs into the laptop. It plugs in so that the powercord of in line with the point, so that it keeps breaking. Most other laptop DC adaptors have an L shaped configuration, so that the stress dosent load on the insert point. I have been through 3 adaptors already; Ultimatly had to get out the soldering iron, remake the insert into an L shape, and seal with epoxy putty. I shouldnt have to do this though.....When buying your next laptop, try to make sure the power adaptor is a L shaped insert, rather than straight line in.", "Date": "June 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "compaqs are bad", "Author": "Ryan L", "ReviewID": "RYGPMC4XMMDHO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Had a CQ60 computer for a little over a year and the battery gets to 40% and the computer dies.

We both work with computers for a living, and have had 4 or 5 computers all networked together through our MAC timecapsule, and have never had an issue of any kind. I was trying to save money, and get a good deal, but I ended up spending money we didn't have, on computers that don't work. If I had to do it over, would spend the extra money and get a MAC.

Today is 28 Sept 09. I have been on the phone with tech support more times than I can count trying to figure out why this piece of junk keeps popping up a bluescreen error and shutting down. After a month of calls they finaly decide I need to return it to the factory so they can fix it. The kicker is now HP has decided they will no longer pay shipping to return their defective product under warantee. This unit has yet to remain operational for more than a day at a time, their tech support can't fix it (great at teling me to contact Microsoft; everything is Microsoft's fault if you listen to them) and now I get to fork out some $20-30 for shipping and insurance.

The one last year, the screen died and can't get them to replace it, or fix it even though it is warranty according the the flunky e-mail support team. I bought another a week ago and was dead on delivery. The laptop I have still running is an old IBM. This is for my home use. At work I buy MAC laptops. The Dell laptops we bought years ago, some are still running even being 6-7 years old and swapping parts to fix others. I just bought 8 HP desktops and all are good. I would recommend a DELL or a Toshiba if you need a laptop and it needs to be a PC; but do not know how well their replacement is because they outlasted warranties unlike HP-Compoop laptops.
