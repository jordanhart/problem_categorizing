I had far too many issues with this laptop. TONS actually. From the motherboard going out, over heating, screen not turning on, wireless stopped working. I would have it fixed. Then 2 weeks later, SAME ISSUES. HP finally sent me a \"refurbished\" one, which worked for about 1 month, than the SAME EXACT THING....I now actually have the DV6000 and I have not had one single issue. It's bigger, larger ram, and I'll have it until the wheels fall off, so to speak....So, not out of hate or dislike for HP, but do NOT purchase this product, especially with no warranty, because I feel confident enough to say you will have similar issues and wish you went with your gut feeling...", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Owned for over five years!", "Author": "Mark D.

My friend refurbished an old Sony Vaio for me, and admittedly I'll be sad to see this one go. My issues with it throughout its lifetime:1. Mousepad messed up. It was a very minor thing (I think the clicker wasn't working well?) and Geek Squad actually completely made it un-useable. My warranty expired right after they \"fixed\" it, so I just used a mouse ever since. If I use the pad, the mouse will just jump all over the screen and click things. Again, Geek Squad's fault. They're horrible.2. It overheats... But that's because I never clean the fan. Woops.3. Battery can finally not be charged (after five years+, I'd say that's a good lifespan for a battery), but works fine plugged in!4. Got some nasty viruses and had to get the hard drive revamped about.... 2 times? But that wasn't the equipment's fault.All in all, super glad I made this purchase. Most places are offering me 8-25$ for this used babe. In my eyes, she's worth at least 100$! ;-)", "Date": "January 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "HP Pavilion laptop was a disappointment", "Author": "M. L.

I'll never buy an HP again. This model is especially rotten. It gets extremely hot. I have to run a noisy cooling platform under it at all times. Also, the sound card is THE WORST I have ever heard. You might think that an \"entertainment PC\" would have somewhat decent media specs, but NOT THIS ONE! When jacked in to my stereo, it creates whirring and hissing noises that obscure any subtle audio details. Also, the onboard microphone is about the noisiest thing I've ever heard, including old JC Penney tape recorders and the like. I kid you not... the worst sound of any laptop anywhere. HP have outdone themselves in lowering the bar for consumer laptops. And now, not even three years old, the motherboard has given out. I'll be shopping for another brand. Don't be seduced by a low price or ultra-clearance markdown... it is not worth the hassle this piece will give you.
