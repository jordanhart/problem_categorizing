If you're using this for word or just regular typing you will get about 4 hour battery life. Internet? 2 1/2 hours or so. This has a crystal clear display. great sound and great keyboard feel. I love the Sexy Red Color.If you haven't given windows 8.1 a try, give it a chance.

We spent a month trying to figure out the mess that is Windows 8.  Finally, I asked her if she wanted me to just install a Linux distro on it.  She gave me the go ahead and has been happily computing ever since.Flash forward another couple of months and I was in the market for a new laptop for myself.  I decided, based on my experience with my fiance's machine to go with the Asus X550CA.  As soon as I received it, I took the back off it, removed the Windows 8 HD and plopped in a SSD I had laying around.  I then booted off a thumb drive with my Linux distro of choice and installed.  ! Never once had to have to even look at Windows on this machine!The 4 GB of RAM supplied in the machine is more than adequate but, never one to let sleeping dogs lie, I found a 4 GB stick laying around and upped the total RAM to 8 GB.  Now we're talking!  However, I found out that this machine allows for expansion of up to an 8 GB stick.  I quickly placed my order and once received, maxed out the total RAM in this machine to 12 GB!  Holy smokies!  With 12 GB RAM, the Intel integrated graphics can take whatever I throw at them.The only things I don't like, If I can really even say that, is I wish I could've gone with a core i5 or i7.  However, the i3 with all the RAM I threw at it is more than enough.  I'm not computing lunar orbits here.  Also, with the Linux distro, I had to find a fix for getting wifi working.  Not a big deal though.  Ubuntu Forums had a fix that took 30 seconds.Things I do like about it.  The build quality is really good.  When I swapped out HDs, I was surprised to find an all metal drive carriage/heat shield holding the drive in it's bay.  The laptop I took the SSD out of used a cheap tin foil heat shield.  The thing I possibly like the very most is...IT'S RED!!!  Very sexy, good looking laptop.  The screen is wide and clear.  Bang for buck, I can't really find any fault with this machine...once I put a usable operating system on it.  I would recommend this machine to anyone looking for a mostly out of the box Linux compatible laptop.  I would not, however, recommend it if you want to run Windows 8.", "Date": "May 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "not what I expected", "Author": "greg heppe", "ReviewID": "R1DY8KEJL4O510", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Windows 8 has been difficult to use.

We received this laptop a couple of weeks ago, and 4 or 5 days it stopped working. The hard drive was fried! I gave it a 2 star rating because while it worked, my son loved it. We have requested a return and Amazon was great about our returning the product. It has been shipped back today. However, we will not chance another incident like this one so we will buy a laptop locally. The laptop is very important for homeschooling and we just can't afford to keep shipping 'lemons' back to amazon.", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00IZQZ7KO"}}
