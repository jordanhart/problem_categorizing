{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Does what I need it to do", "Author": "Calvin Hodgson", "ReviewID": "RD35CTIXZR0H2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, I bought this laptop brand new on ebay for about $400.Now on to the laptop itself. I wasn't expecting much except for an ultrathin laptop. I was actually quite impressed when I first booted it up. Before this laptop I had any extremely bulk HP Probook 4436s with extended battery that was a pain to take around college. It had 8 GB of ram but suddenly, after booting one day, only recognized 4. That laptop died for reason I don't know why, but anyways back to this review.Acer didn't cut any corners with this sleek laptop. It has a nice sleek brushed aluminum look and very minimal plastic. This ultrabook is so sleek that I can carry in my backback and barley notice it as my textbooks sometimes weigh even more then this. The performance of the core i3 1.5GHz is good for the needs of me, a college student. I can do web surfing with multiple browser windows/tabs open at a time and still have minimal lag. The 4GB on memory is soldered onto the board so it is NOT upgradeable if that is what you are looking for. It is speedy enough to do work on Libre office. Boot times are fast, but the sleep wake time is a little longer then what they state. It is more around 2 seconds but still not bad as my old laptop would take 15+.The keyboard is extremely nice to type on. It is very quite and when I press a key I don't have problems with it not registering. I am a touch typer so I am more gentle then others when typing. My old HP would have problems with registering a key click and it would bug the crap out of me as I had to constantly go back and fix \"lok\" and \"shool\" from my writing. This is not a problem present in this Acer.There is very minimal heat when this computer is doing basic tasks like word processing and surfing. It does get a little hot, I would say around 90-100 F but I don't know exactly. The fan is quite and even when it does turn on it is blaring loud like other laptops can sometimes get. If doing an intensive task it will get louder but nothing that isn't bearable.The screen is altogether great for the price. It is not full HD like other screens but then again you aren't paying an extra $100 either. Viewing angles from looking from the top are bad. If viewing from the side or bottom it mostly gets dim and glare is more noticeable. As there isn't a anit-glare coating that I can see of. Colors are vivid on medium to high brightness.The charger that is lightweight and doesn't feel like you are lugging around a giant brick. Also, it is somewhat small and fits nicely into a bag. Can't really say much more about that since I am not a electrician.Had it for about two weeks and am so far impressed with this slim, speedy little beast. Might write another review after I get some more real world data.Update 3/10/2014: It has been a year later and as of now there are much better devices out there. Technology moves fast. I have not had bad battery life like others complain about. I use this typically all day and charge maybe twice per day. I can last about 4 hours between charges and that is with having a web browser with multiple tabs open at a time. The 4 GB of memory is really limiting. I use Photoshop CC and Lightroom 5.3 and the Intel graphics has problems. In PS CC at certain times the picture will flash black so I cannot see what I am editing. Lightroom starts to get really slow even in high performance mode. If I could I would get a screen resolution that was at least 1080P because of the work I do with photo editing and looking at stock charts.For now it will serve my needs since I really don't have enough money for something that is much better.", "Date": "January 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Would Look Elsewhere", "Author": "John Garvin \"JRG\"", "ReviewID": "R38PGUX9OZ2A54", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I love the 13\" screen. No noisy fan, no cooling ports on bottom to worry aout blocking, never hot, quick start-up. Changed to Windows 7. After having for a few months the keyboard is strange and when typing cursor jumps around and you have to constantly follow what you are typing or next thing you know you have deleted part of your text or started typing in the middle of what you have already entered. My wife has an Aspire S3 that looks identical except with Spanish keyboard.

I paid under $350 for a refurbished unit and at that price point this laptop is unbeatable.  The track pad is a bit \"clunky\", but that's not a deal breaker.  It's light weight and ultra thin profile is fantastic and every bit as good as the ones that cost $300 - $400 more.  The time to up and running from sleep mode is very quick and the boot up time from a complete power off mode is acceptable for the price.  This line of Acer Ultrabooks is at the bottom of the performance and specification spectrum for this category, but unless you place a high demand on your laptop you won't be disappointed in this machine for the price.", "Date": "August 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Looks and feels like a macbook", "Author": "Ravi", "ReviewID": "R203LKZ2JF0KFH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best value for the price.

Bought a high end Sony Vaio with 12G memory a few months ago. Always have problems with wifi. Totally crashed once already. I put that laptop aside collecting dust now.This Acer is simply excellent! It weighs about the same as 11\" laptops while 30+% screen area makes my every day on-the-road job much much easier. It runs reasonably fast. It connects to any available wifi without hesitation. The screen is bright and clear. It does not have a touch screen. However this does not bother me since I don't like to use that feature which gets finger prints on the screen, reduces the clarity of screen display.I would recommend this laptop to anyone without hesitation.

I have pretty simple computer needs...browsing the internet, watching netflix, using the occasional spreadsheet...it does all of those things well, and I didn't have to drop more than a grand to get it. The computer is very slim and looks sleek; however, you can definitely tell that they use a lot of plastic where apple would use aluminum. The result is a very light laptop that feels a little bit cheap (though much less cheap than some of the other ultrabooks in competes against). The only thing that I'm disappointed with on this computer is the battery life. Brand new, out of the box, it only lasts 2.5-3 hrs while browsing the internet.
