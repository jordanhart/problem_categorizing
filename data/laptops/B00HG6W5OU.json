Wilson", "ReviewID": "R3FG9LE9APF3NN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A farewell to Sony's Vaio line.  Sony sold their VAIO PC business.  See my last paragraph for more about that.Sony states that the VAIO Fit E SVF15323CXW laptop is for business or pleasure (however it is not a gaming laptop--which typically have an i7 quadcore CPU and faster graphics).  This Vaio has a dual core Intel i5 CPU, 6 gigs of memory, and a 750 gigabyte hard drive.  There is a CD/DVD writer (not Blu-Ray).  The 15.5 inch LED widescreen screen is full HD 1920x1080 resolution and is vivid and sharp.  The LED screen is not a touchscreen. (If you want a touchscreen, see the similar Sony VAIO SVF15324CXW 15.5-Inch Touchscreen i5 Laptop, which at this time is remarkably only $70 more--and has 2 GB more memory but also 1.4 pounds heavier.) The speakers (with subwoofers) sound great.  There is one HDMI output.  Battery life is rated at 5 hours.  It comes with Windows 8.1.  The stated warranty is one year.What's in the box:  the Sony VAIO laptop, charging cord/brick, quick start guides, and spec sheetsBootup and wakeup: The Sony boots up in about 15 seconds.  After you sign in the Windows 8.1 modern or metro screen with tiles is displayed.  The Rapid Wake technology lets you just close the laptop to put it into sleep mode, and then when you open the laptop it resumes where you were in less than two seconds.Windows Experience (Performance) Index:  Processor (CPU): 7.2;  Memory (RAM): 7.2;  Graphics Score: 4.9;  Gaming Graphics (3D): 5.1;  Primary Hard Disk: 5.9;  Base Score: 4.9Playing DVD movies:  Windows Media Center is not included.

If you are not using a touchscreen device or computer then you may find the Windows 8 experience to be user unfriendly and unproductive. Expert Paul Thurrott stated that Windows 8 is a disaster and \"has set back Microsoft and Windows by years, and possibly for good.\"  The Windows 8.1 has been called \"slightly less terrible\" as it did not fix many user complaints. There are still a number of annoyances, one being that the 8.1 Start button just takes you back to the Metro Start screen with colorful tiles and does not show a true Start menu with a list of programs like in Windows 7.  From the Metro screen, if you click on one of the tiles to start an app or program like Weather, then the Weather app will fill the entire screen and there will not be minimize/maximize icons on the top right corner, you will not see a taskbar at the bottom showing open programs, and you won't even see a Start button in the lower left corner (unless you drag the cursor into that corner--and sometimes not even then).  The Start menu is still dead and a third party fix is still necessary if you want a Windows 7-like Start menu. There are numerous annoyances and the learning curve has been described as steep.Other thoughts: Consumer Reports to my knowledge has not reported on this Sony laptop.  The 2014 Buying Guide included the older and less capable  Sony Vaio Fit SVF15213CXB ($725), which was the only Sony laptop shown in the 15\" to 16\" category, and it was ranked #23.  It was given an excellent rating for ergonomics and very good marks for versatility and display.  No fair or poor scores were given.Final note:Consumers prefer to avoid risk. That is why the user reviews are so valuable to Amazon. Some degree of risk may have been introduced as Sony sold its Vaio computer business to Japan Industrial Partners (JIP), who will reportedly sell the Vaio brand only in Japan for now. Sony is reporting a $1.1 billion loss for the year and laying off 5,000 employees worldwide. Gartner reports that global PC shipments fell 10 percent in 2013, returning to 2009 levels, marking the worst decline ever. Some of this may be attributed to sales of smartphones and tablets. However some of us don't want to work in Excel on a small touchscreen or type a long document with one or two fingers. Nor have consumers wanted the Metro style Windows 8. History has now repeated itself. Businesses and consumers didn't want Windows Vista (2009), nor Windows 8 (2013) which some called a disaster.  So these unpopular Windows versions lead to falling hardware sales and manufacturers such as Sony took a hit as people wait for the next version of Windows.  Windows 8 was released 16 months ago and now has 10% of the marketshare of all operating systems--one-third of the percentage for Windows XP.  So the question to a potential buyer becomes one of whether the news about the Vaio sale will cause prices to fall on the remaining inventory.  And what risk does Sony's sale to JIP introduce for warranties, support, updates, and drivers in the US for the next year or 3 years? Will the Vaio's be upgradeable to Windows 9 in 2015? JIP says they will honor Sony's warranties, but does that leave you with any uncertainty? If the unknown risk factor is higher than you wish, then I would mention that the latest Laptop Mag annual review rated Lenovo, Asus, and HP (in that order) as the best Windows notebook brands.  Note that Samsung and Sony were next, followed by Dell, Acer, and Toshiba. (And Apple was rated higher than any of the Windows notebooks. A interesting note: there are reports that Steve Jobs wanted to work a deal to run Apple's OS X on Sony Vaio laptops.  Maybe things would have been different if that had come about.) This Sony Vaio is very nice, no complaints except for Windows 8.1. But will there be support and update issues in the future?

Runs really smoothly, etc.  But it was missing a key feature shown in the description for this product -- the touchscreen.  This is not a touchscreen product.  It is indeed HD, but it is not touchscreen as shown in the description.  Which makes me think Sony just copied/pasted the description from elsewhere.  I chose to keep this laptop for now because that was not a deal breaker and everything else is great, but Sony needs to be more careful describing their products as it was misleading.Edit 2/20/14-  It seems like Sony removed the touchscreen illustration and accompanying text from the description so I bumped up my star rating to 4 stars from 3.", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "it's ok i guess, if you dont like wifi, that is.", "Author": "stephen", "ReviewID": "R310WZY106UPF6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am kind of a fan boy when it comes to Sony.  I own a ps3 (don't game enough to justify a ps4 yet) that I bought when they were first released, I have a Sony smart tv, I have a Sony hdr-hc1 that I bought when they were $3k.I love all of those and they have been great to me, but this laptop has not.There is a known issue with the WiFi and Sony should recall all of these and fix them.  It disconnects on it's own randomly.  Signal strength is weak even though it's 5 feet from the WiFi router.  Might as well be a desktop because you have to plug the cable in.Do not buy this until Sony starts caring about it's costumers again.

In comparison to my three year old HP Pavilion, the first thing I noted was the weight difference. Despite being nearly twice the size, the Sony is lighter and slimmer than my HP. The sound is very good and the speed, graphics, and image are all much better.There are some remarkable advances in computers these days, and one in particular really caught my attention. There is a \"two-second\" wake mode (it automatically goes into sleep mode upon closing) and it will stay in sleep mode for up to 4 days unplugged. That's way cool.I'm intrigued if a bit overwhelmed by the personalized start screen full of big, colorful blocks of favorites instead of a simple home page. You can option around for various set-ups, but this factory setting is pretty in-your-face. The photos on the page show this perfectly. This will take getting used to, and I grew frustrated with what seemed like a constantly shrinking screen whenever I touched the mousepad. I'm not sure why the zoom setting is so sensitive, but getting used to that will also take time.Spring-boarding from the previous concern; another odd and off-putting thing is the design of the keyboard. Because it is a larger computer on the whole, there is room for a full numeric keypad on the right hand side. This is pretty cool but also shifts your hand placement correspondingly to the left. In addition, the mouse/keypad is just a flat square, without any distinction between right and left. You simply gauge intuitively. This takes some getting used to as well as seems unnecessary. Again, pictures on the Amazon page show these issues in detail, but I thought it worth noting.This laptop is a sleek, gorgeous, and very impressive machine. The screen is big enough to enjoy movies on the go, there are four USB ports, one HDMI plug, a power cord featuring a small and lightweight block, and a lightning fast response - at least out of the box. We all know that adding programs, items to memory, etc. slows a computer down, but for now....wow.The bottom line is price, but Amazon thoughtfully has a list of four comparable models with varying prices, this being the second cheapest. Also, this is not a 2-in-1 laptop nor does it possess a touch-screen. The monitor does not detach to become a tablet, if that's what you were considering as a requirement. My issues were merely of acclimation, so please take them as such. In time, I feel quite confident that this will become a vital appendage in my life.For now - 4.5 stars.", "Date": "March 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "Sarah", "ReviewID": "R1PDHIAWVIV6D1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love it! It's a little big, the keyboard has that extra digit keyboard on the right side that usually desktop computers have but it's all right, it's not gigantic or anything, it's just kinda big, which surprised me but you definetely get used to it.

Also, I have never had a Sony laptop prior to receiving this one. I've used Dell, HP, and ASUS but never Sony. I'm now sorry I've never tried one of these. I don't even know where to begin with this Vaio. First, the design of it is spectacular, beautiful, and very user friendly - especially the keyboard (it's a full keyboard with the extra number pad on the right side) with its backlit keys and smoothness. When I say the keys are smooth, I mean to the touch and very sensitive. No need to apply too much pressure so it's much easier to type faster, which I love because I'm a writer and this is important for me. It's amazing how quickly the key lights come on the second you touch a key. The weight is good - sturdy but not heavy and it's also a lot slimmer than any of my other laptops. Sound quality spectacular. Graphics amazing. And the wake/up sleep modes are very quick with a 2-3 second response time. The laptop wakes up almost instantaneously and I love this. I love the simplicity of the mouse pad without all of the lines and markings delineating right and left clicks - we all know how to use this by now, no? The only thing that threw me with the mouse pad was the pinching and expanding function - much like a touch screen iphone or tablet. Took me a bit to figure that out but it's fine now and I actually like it.I love the internal disc drive and it's quick reading ability. I was able to insert program discs and download them almost immediately. It doesn't have much of a lag time in responding.Also includes 4 USB ports and a card slot for digital media. 750 GB of internal storage is nothing to sneeze at either even though many people are looking for a terabyte this days. I'm good with the 750.One minor thing I had some issues with is Windows 8 and this isn't a reflection on the actual device. Windows 8 is so different than previous versions, it's rather off-putting at first. I'm dealing with it but there's just too much stuff bloating the opening screen. I would never choose about 75% of the \"apps\" they think are interesting or useful and I haven't quite figured out how to delete a lot of this nonsense. Really, it's completely overcrowded with useless junk. Windows 8 is a work in progress for me at this point but I think it's a bit much, overall.The only other thing I would say is that I was surprised by how thin the power cord is. I'm not sure if this is just how they make them now but it seems like they could have given this a bit more heft. I guess it's a simple thing to replace if necessary so I opted not to remove a star for that.Like I said earlier, I'm not an IT person just a high volume user. As a writer, my laptop is the most important tool I have and I absolutely love this one.Recommend.", "Date": "March 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worst Vaio I've ever bought", "Author": "Dawn Brink", "ReviewID": "R1C5E9TEGZ3IMV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "USB ports and SD card slot drivers/ won't stay installed.

The initial repairman said nothing about damage but all they say is that \"Our tech says there is damage and it is not covered\".  Really!!
