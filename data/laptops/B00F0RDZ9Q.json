I call it netbook because its small and has no DVD drive but its powerfull enough to rival any basic laptop.  It has a Core-I3 processor and plenty of memory.  I can accomplish any task on this netbook that I would ordinarily do on my home or business computer.  Plus, its small and lightweight enough to carry around in my briefcase.  I love it and recommend it.", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love It!", "Author": "Joe H", "ReviewID": "R314826GFLUDDZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easier to use after the free upgrade to Windows 8.1. I've only had it a week but two things I am happy with so far is the plastic body has a carbon fiber look and feel to it and more importantly the wireless internet reception capability is awesome. At work in a room with a very weak signal this laptop beats all(compared to about 8 various laptops). As far as start time, I am up and running and on the internet 53 seconds after pushing the Power button.", "Date": "April 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "horrible touch pad other than that is quite nice", "Author": "Miguel Lorenzo", "ReviewID": "R1157T3EWXH2RE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I feel is a good notebook.

I have used it for my online college classes while I recline in my favorite chair. The computer has the power of a much more expensive computer, but can be used on the go owing to its light weight. I also use it to stream directly to the HDMI input on my audio amplifier. I have had this computer for two weeks and have watched Netflix streaming programs via home WiFi. The computer does wake up in 2 seconds due to the hybrid hard drive. When asleep it uses minimal battery power, so you can close the lid and then open it back up and resume whatever you were doing. I use this feature when I take it to and from work. The cost is the lowest when comparing similar features with other brands. I am very happy with this computer.", "Date": "May 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not worth it considering alternatives", "Author": "Daniel Sacilotto \"krelianx\"", "ReviewID": "ROH1IJQTAVI5N", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is considered a successor model to the x200ca, although it's basically the same build.I got my hands on a refurbished x202e model by ASUS, which has pretty similar specs, except that that model ran on a third generation i3 3217u vs this model's 4th gen Haswell 4010u chip. Besides that, only the battery (3-cell vs. 2-cell) build is different. I sold my x202e because I found that the battery, although acceptable, was coming up short for my expectations (3 hours ish on browsing...)With a low voltage Haswell, and a 3-cell battery, well, I  expected a boost in battery life. So I got this thing new. The build is much coarser, and plasticky. The battery life is only marginally better. And the trackpad came in wonky... slightly sunken on the left side, which I hear is a recurrent problem with ASUS zenbooks as well.On the upshot, although this also comes in at 4GB ram, it is allegedly upgradable to 8GB.The screen brightness is also a bit too low on this one, and it is both a tad thicker and heavier (marginally, however).In addition, the machine feels actually slightly slow and sluggish at present, compared to the x202e. I upgraded to 8.1, and the drivers, but the performance is still less than what I was expecting. Also, the restart time is ridiculously long after the 8.1 upgrade. It takes about 4 minutes...My advice is that you stick to the i3 x202e, which you can get refurbished for $300 if you have a little patience. This model is uglier, not better in performance, slightly heavier, and only marginally superior in battery life. And, of course, the defective touchpad is not a relief. As per the camera and sound, I haven't really tested them yet. It is still probably a good deal overall, but I just don't get why anyone would get this over the x202e.I am very let down by this machine; I was expecting better battery, and the loosened touchpad right out of the box compromise the comfort and solidity as well. I will send it back and get a x202e when I see it for a good price, or maybe just a t100...I'm getting around 3.5-4 hours battery, which is only very marginally better than what I had. Not worth the additional $200 I spent.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Ultrabook Type Laptop Under $750", "Author": "John3:16", "ReviewID": "RW8VQ1DUHV0OV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Edit: My apologies, this review is for the excellent S200e not this model.Not long ago a powerful compact Ultrabook like this would have cost you $1500 +.  In the last year there have been a proliferation of compact laptops. Unfortunately most are underpowered using a weak Celeron or AMD processor with little RAM and no connectivity or expansion options and therefore have limited usefulness. Not this model; it has a strong Intel I3 processor and 4 GB RAM and more competing power than my desktop. You have a slew of connectivity options: ethertnet, HDMI, USB 3.0, multi card reader, VGA, stereo out etc. If you are a road warrior or on the go student this is your laptop.ProsPerfect size and lightweight for on the go useBright, vivid screen with accurate touch responseStrong Intel ProcessorGreat keyboard and track padExcellent Speakers for a LaptopAwesome Asus build QualityGood Video CameraPlenty of ports and connectivity options.Almost instant start up with Hybrid Hard DriveConsNo DVD DriveNote about Hard Drive. I was initially reluctant to buy this model as I wanted an SSD drive. A 500 GB SSD drive would cost more than this entire laptop. Asus wisely chose a hybrid drive which includes a small SSD drive for the operating system and a 500 GB traditional hard drive for everything else. The result are the fast start ups you get from an SSD with plenty of storage for all your programs, files.Note About Multimedia / Presentations: With both VGA out and HDMI you can play Power Point presentations in the board room and High Definition movies on a TV or projector. There is no DVD drive but the hard drive has room for over 100 DVD quality movies while leaving room for your programs and files.", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "product arrived a day earlier", "Author": "WT Ho", "ReviewID": "R2JYPRW3EUMX8O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "4* was for the fact it arrived a day earlier and my husband was able to get his hands on it. however, the price is pretty high for a laptop with such specs. i'm pretty disappointed a i3 laptop is still selling at this price.", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$499.00", "Features": "Intel Core i3-4010U (1.7GHz)\n4 GB DDR3\n500 GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive\nWindows 8, 5-hour battery life", "Name": "ASUS X200LA-DH31T 11.6-Inch Touchscreen i3 Laptop (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41WoRFPWOzL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00F0RDZ9Q"}}
