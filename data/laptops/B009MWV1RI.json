If I could change one thing, I'd move one of the USB ports to the right side.  With all USB ports on the left, I have a mouse cord crossing around in front or behind to use my mouse with my right hand.  It was very well packaged and I would have no hesitation about buying from this seller again.", "Date": "May 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Budget laptop!", "Author": "Bill", "ReviewID": "R3CJ1V4Q0FR5KX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very good for the price! The other reviewers must be crazy. I think this is a perfect college computer or if you need it for light to medium use. I mean, this is no laptop for hardcore use. But, it is very suitable for everything else. Windows 8 can take some time to adjust but it gets really easy. I wish there were better hotkeys, too. Oh, the speakers are nothing special. But, all these drawbacks are to be expected with an inexpensive computer. I highly recommend it if you are on a budget or if you need a laptop for school or maybe work.", "Date": "September 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "ASUS Computer", "Author": "Andy Hunter", "ReviewID": "RBTQ0G6B93PD4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The computer did not work out of the box. Windows 8, which I did not want, was preinstalled and the backlite for the monitor was not working. Had to mail the product to ASUS in California for repair. Also had to pay the postage as ASUS did not authorized postage. Not happy with this experience.", "Date": "September 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "lots of issues", "Author": "Zimothy", "ReviewID": "R2JYKMADJPWX51", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "i'm pretty mad about this, tbh. as soon as I got the laptop i was having issues with programs 'not responding' or my internet stopping. i have to keep skype open at all times because it's the only way I know if I stop having a connection. it doesn't even make any sense because when that happens i open the networks and click on mine - not even to disconnect and reconnect. i just click it and the internet is restored.so that sucks. and programs crash pretty often. I think I had three tabs up on my browser and I went to click something and it just freezes everything, sometimes the not-responding program affects the whole computer and suddenly I can't even open my start menu. I went to do an automatic update two days ago and the entire computer crashed. nothing we did would get it to work. i finally had to get to this emergency menu setting and completely reset the computer, losing all of my data because I didn't realize that this computer doesn't come with a backup CD. you have to make one.so there's that too.i mean. the start up is really fast but yeah. i wish I had bought a different laptop.", "Date": "August 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "I bought as a gift for my brother now Im getting one for myself! :-)", "Author": "chuck ashlin", "ReviewID": "R1PL09ZI6355MQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In my opinion, Asus, is one of the best notebooks, if not the best avalible today. I bought this for my brother...I did the quick setup, activated the warrenty and registration and my brother loves it! No problems whatsoever. A quality product at a very cheap price that funtions like a notebook costing far more. I dont know how Asus sells their products so cheap, but the price has to go up sooner or later. Fantastic Seller and support. The shipping was so fast I still cant believe it!", "Date": "June 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ok computer for word prossesing", "Author": "Justin Brian", "ReviewID": "RFD8L3CNENILA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I highly recommend that you DO NOT PURCHASE THIS COMPUTER. First the battery life when you just purchase it the battery will be strong, and after a month really bad. 2nd the graphics card turns off so much and you have to reset your computer to turn it back on. Also all the Windows 8 pad gestures get really annoying so now I'm using it with a mouse. And I'll never forget the time I got blue screen on this. The ASUS X55C is especially not meant for gaming In most games you get about 9fps (Frames Per Second).If I were you I would save up for a different PC with no windows 8 or a Mac.", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Intel Core i3-2350M 2.3 GHz\n4 GB SDRAM\n500 GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive\n15.6-Inch Screen\nWindows 8", "Name": "Asus X55C-DH31 15.6-Inch Laptop", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Ex-qG67LL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009MWV1RI"}}
