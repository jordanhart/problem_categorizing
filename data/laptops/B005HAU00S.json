Altogether very solid and attractive. Processor is fast enough and memory is more than enough. Battery is phenomenal.But there is a serious flaw with the Elan touchpad: it's very erratic and unstable. It jerks around, frequently opening apps you didn't intend to, or straying around your document. While I'd done my due diligence research on this unit before purchasing, it wasn't until I'd delved into some geek forums that I discovered others making the same complaint. Several expressed astonishment that ASUS has been letting this flaw pass for years now.After reporting this problem to ASUS support, they instructed me to reinstall the touchpad and load BIOS default. I did this, but it didn't correct the problem, which I assume is uncorrectable after reading about it in the forums. In the end, I bought an external wireless mouse.I wish I could recommend ASUS to friends, but this mouse issue is so fundamental, I cannot do so. And it is truly jawdropping that ASUS would let this problem go on for years without intervention.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "ASUS i-5, 2410M 2.3GHz, 8GB RAM, 750GB HD, Win7 Home Prem", "Author": "Atlanta Guy \"In Atlanta\"", "ReviewID": "R3EN8Q6OWDGUY0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this laptop about 3 mos.  For the most part I love it.  It's fast, clear, thin, light, and doesn't get hot.  I've had it on my lap for about 1 hour and it's fine - barely warm.  Yes, the battery makes it heavier, but compared to other laptops the same size it's great.  I love the full keyboard with number pad.The mouse pad is okay - not as smooth or large as macs, but better than most PC mouse pads.  I use it with a wireless mouse - they are cheap and very good these days.  There's a youtube vid on this laptop and the guy comments that the dvd drive is very sensitive - I haven't used mine for burning yet.  The speakers are definitely small - but I think they had to do this to get the profile so thin.  If you use a laptop for music you should probably have separate speakers anyway.", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great laptop, but you can find better at this price range.", "Author": "Zone", "ReviewID": "R21RFYC6UGPYJV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this product about a year ago from a big box store for about $500 during a sale.  Overall I have been very happy with the product.The greatest appeal to this laptop is it's power and it's battery life.On a full charge this thing can go about five hours.  And while you may not have a the best processor or video card, I can still play games like Oblivion and Starcraft II on it at decent quality.Like others have said, the touch pad is a bit too sensitive.  I have often bumped it and unintentionally clicked things.I have used the laptop heavily for a year and a half now and the battery is beginning to show it's wear.  It's only doing about 3 hours on a full charge now.My only other gripe is cosmetic.  Some of the letters too quickly wore off.  The left mouse button got worn as well.Overall I am satisfied with my purchase.  The laptop runs quickly, quietly, and coolly.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Really enjoying this laptop!", "Author": "Bob", "ReviewID": "RGEEDQTUUND16", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this laptop for 3 months and got it at Best Buy out of the box. Really, like the keyboard and the design of it and it has been excellent for my online courses. I have minitap and SAS software on here and it runs very smoothly.

By 16 months, the motherboard rendered the laptop unusable. ASUS would not honor the repair even though the unit was just a few months out of warranty.  In my opinion, the motherboard was not manufactured to be a durable component and spoils the good features of the laptop since it is not usable without an expensive repair (around $400).  ASUS had an opportunity to practice good citizenship and take responsibility for the substandard component but chose not to.  I have seen a number of identical complaints involving some ASUS motherboards.", "Date": "December 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Thorn Brings Down the Lion of a Machine", "Author": "Dan W", "ReviewID": "R371AN0H8V430K", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Purchased for $630 at Best Buy Feb2012. Absolutely loved this laptop when compared to other similar units for the price. Unfortunately, after 3 months of breaking it in, I would recommend looking for something else.Wanted to get to the I5 processor level and wanted to get away from a history of HP purchases. ASUS had a good reputation so for the price, the U56E seemed like a great deal.I can't stress enough how absolutely annoying the touchpad is. I have tweaked the ELAN software infinitely and can't find a setting that is comfortable. Scrolling is the worst. ELAN breaks from the traditional regions model and replaces it with finger gestures that they should have tested on a focus group or something. Instead of scrolling with one finger on the right side of the touchpad, it takes two fingers anywhere on the pad. Scrolling is very jittery and unstable. It's distracting enough that I will use the arrow buttons to scroll down instead of using the touchpad.Additionally, and even worse, it is a nightmare tapping a link. The touchpad is so oversensitive I have actually moved the pointer without even touching the pad. My finger hovered right over it and moved the pointer. So when you think you are clicking on a link it moves the pointer ever so slightly away from the intended link and you end up repositioning the pointer AGAIN and trying to tap the link. I've done this up to three or four times to try and get to the same link. This alone negates my desire to ever purchase an ASUS product again as research on this problem shows it is not fixable, adjustable, and is widespread.PROS:1.Wonderful battery life. Never as long as the meter shows but 6 to 7 hours is a given2.Great feel when typing. The smooth texture on the bottom part of the laptop is a pleasure to type with3.Charges quickly.4.USB 3.0 allows for fast charging for phones, IPODS, etc.5.Great specs for Hard Drive and Memory.6.VERY quiet and never gets hotCons:1.Touchpad -worst I've ever experienced. This alone makes me regret purchase2.Keyboard-Loved the chiclet keys in the store and still like to type on it but find I make many more typing mistakes than a conventional keyboard.3.Keyboard layout -Terrible layout. Common features such as Volume Control, Wifi on/off require a Function button to be used. Very annoying. There is a full number pad but it is so compact that it isn't really an advantage to have it. Plus, due to the addition of the number pad, the placement of the arrow keys, the home,end,delete, pageup/down keys are in weird spots. Really bad if you are a heavy Excel keyboard user.4.Speakers are a joke. They might have been fine if the placement was not UNDER THE LAPTOP.Not sure what I would recommend in it's place but I would keep looking.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Earlier review retracted: 11 months later", "Author": "Okoa", "ReviewID": "RBELX6NO2TGJX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "In March of 2012, I bought this ASUS laptop and after testing it out for a few weeks, left a 4-star review on here saying how light and functional it was, despite the terrible speakers (underneath the laptop, guys? Seriously?). After owning it for 11 months, I've deleted that review and I'm here to warn you: this is one of the most unreliable and absolutely pathetic excuses for a computer I've ever seen. It began a few months after I bought it when it started shutting off randomly on its own, which got worse and worse until I decided to send it into the manufacturer's for repairs. They replaced the hard drive, but the problem actually persisted. After ruling out the possibility of a virus, software conflict, overheating issue, overcharging the battery, this leads me to believe that the hard drive itself has a fault and all laptops of this brand are similarly faulty (especially going by many of the reviews on here). The official Asus live chat was also unable to troubleshoot it. Very, very disappointed.

I use mine for surfing the web, watching movies, listening to music, some work, and some play. This computer is not a gaming computer but used more for other stuff. I was aware of this when I bought it. The graphics for the game are not the best, hence why they say it's not great for gaming. Two years having this laptop and no issue.
