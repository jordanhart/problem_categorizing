Mainly because I had bought a netbook back in 2009 and it had sufficed for my mobile computing needs.In November 2011 this unit was at Bestbuy's BF sale and I bought one.Construction:- The unit feels quite solid.  I found no problems with its construction.Display:  The 15.6\" screen size is more than adequate for most all of my computing uses:- browsing- working with office docs, spreadsheets and such.- video viewing (such as youtube or DVDs) is great. No display problems, no choppiness in playback.External screen outputs: Either one works fine, to drive a larger, external monitor.- VGA port (aka HD15 port)- HDMI portBuilt-in card reader:I have tested some 16GB SDHC cards which had \"Live versions\" of linux loaded on them.The card reader worked fine both an SD card reader and as a secondary boot device for the \"Live\" linux OS loaded onto the SDHC cards.Battery life:- This laptops battery life is quite good. I have not ran the battery down completely but with my choice tokeep the screen \"brighter\" than normal while it's on battery, I'm still getting an estimated 4 hours+ of battery life.- this factor has moved me away from using my old netbook as often as I had in the past, since my netbook's 3-cell battery's life was short compared to this Gateway laptop.Wireless:- reception and connection speed is good for this device. It does it's MS updates, it's AV updates and all downloads via wireless with no problems.CPU:  This CPU and this unit's overall speed is better than I had expected.I use i5 and i7 laptops at work and have not found this gateway i3 to be much slower than the fasteri-series CPU laptops I use at work.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Bang for the Buck", "Author": "Kym", "ReviewID": "RJCQZ4MGLV27X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this computer on Cyber Monday of this year (2012) at a rock bottom price of $309.00  If that isn't unbelievable enough, let me tell you what an awesome package this is!  It works unbelievably well and has all the bells and whistles as it came with Windows 7 which I love.  The laptop is lightweight, the battery lasts just long enough, and it has plenty of space; even for a homeschooling parent.  I think this MUST be the best computer on the market for the most reasonable price!  We watch our expenditures in my house and this product is worth much more than I paid for it.
