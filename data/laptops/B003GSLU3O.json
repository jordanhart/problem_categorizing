{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Dollars and sense", "Author": "KSBAY", "ReviewID": "R13PL3KVC9MS7V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is an able computer, but the so called value additions that make this model $300 more expensive than the standard Macbook Pro 13 are hardly worth it. If you're thinking about buying this version of the 13 inch Macbook Pro, please consider taking a look at the standard Apple MacBook Pro MC374LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop.The only difference between this $1499 MBP 13 and the $1199 MBP 13 are  processor speed and hard drive space - this MBP 13 has a 2.66ghz processor and 320 gb hard drive while the standard MBP 13 has a 2.4 ghz processor and 250 gb hard drive.So you're paying $300 more (20% of the cost of the $1499 MBP 13 or 25% of the cost of the standard $1199 MBP 13) and getting only 70 gb more hard drive space and a processor faster by 266 mhz (Approximately 10%). Whether that's  worth a $300 price difference over the standard MPB 13 is questionable.Everything else is IDENTICAL in both MPB 13's - Superdrive, backlit keyboard, multi-touch trackpad, screen (1280 x 800 resolution Glossy LED backlit screen), iSight camera, Nvidia Geforce 320m integrated graphics, speakers, amount of ram (4gb - good for multitasking),number of ports(1 Firewire 800 port,2 USB 2.0 ports), SD Card slot, wireless capabilities (802.11n specification; 802.11a/b/g compatible, Bluetooth 2.1 and Gigabit Ethernet -10/100/1000). THE SAME EVERYTHING.The software included is also the same - OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard and the iLife 09 suite of content creation tools. A 1 year warranty on parts and 90 day telephone technical support is also standard on both modelsLet's consider a situation where you choose to buy the standard MBP 13 instead of this model. You'd save $300.You could then put it towards purchasing a 500 gb hard drive (for approximately $80 on Amazon) and install it yourself. That's a bigger hard drive than the one included in this $1499 model. The installation instructions are included in the MBP 13 manual and it doesn't void the warranty. You'll need a Philips #00 screwdriver. Installation videos are also available online.You'd also have $220 left with which,(if you decide to) you could buy Applecare or Squaretrade and protect your machine for 2 more years after the first year limited warranty runs out.If you're interested in using your money optimally, do consider the standard Apple MacBook Pro MC374LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop It's 99% identical in terms of hardware and capability in comparison to this $1499 MBP 13 and is in all aspects, a much better value for money buy.Hope this helps!", "Date": "August 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Video Review on the MacBook Pro

purchasing a Mac is to determine if you are ready to make the leap from the world of the PCs. Personally, for my day-to-day use (and creating video reviews for Amazon.com) I love using Macs. They are very intuitive - and importantly- they always seem to work. Rarely do programs randomly close down or does the computer just completely freeze.Now that is out of the way - why should you consider the 2.66GhZ MacBook Pro? Is it really worth the extra cost versus the Apple MacBook Pro MC374LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop and the Apple MacBook Pro MC374LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop? For me the answer was a (pretty) easy, yes. I love the increased speed in Video editing provided by the 4G of RAM (compared to the 2G on the standard Macbook) and the 2.66GHz Processor.A run down of the things I like about this model- The display is awesome - the LED screen is very crisp and uses less power.- Firewire port -- SD card reader - it comes in more handy than you might expect- 10 hours of battery life- The 4G of Ram helps with video processor and other memory intensive activities- Super Fast... programs open almost instantly.- I was able to load all of my old programs using Time Machine- Aluminum frame - I had some issues with the plastic on our previous Macbook- Very lightweight- The wireless N card seems to work much faster than the N card on our older Mac ...in truth, it seems like it help to expand the range of the router Apple AirPort Extreme Base Station (Simultaneous Dual-Band) (MC340LL/A)- I really do like the backlit keyboard - I know it seems like a minor thing, but we really do like it.- I do recommend purchasing the Apple Care. It is expensive but Apple customer service can not be matched.Final Verdict- While the Macbook Pros are more expensive than comparable laptops to me it does't make much of a difference - the Macbook Pros are worth it. They work perfectly out of the box and offer great performance. I really couldn't be happier5 Stars - No Second Thoughts on this Purchase", "Date": "June 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing Laptop", "Author": "Joel Herrmann", "ReviewID": "RNII1LKVH3XP4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first Mac ever, and I absolutely love it. The only downside is the high price, but this laptop is certainly worth the price you pay. The trackpad is amazing, and the aluminum unibody is so nice.

Though low resolution...", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R8UM3S0KB570I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I programme a lot and use my laptop for both intensive work and sometimes for games too. It handles both supremely well - and has a very crisp screen that's easy on the eyes. I got the 256 SSD harddisk and it's bloody quick! I changed over from my IBM thinkpad basically for the ascetics of the new macs (and the fact that I found out there are two programmable mouse buttons on it!)Battery life is around 4-5 hours with normal use I'd say. With careful and low level stuff, I think maybe 6-7 hours is possible doing reasonable things... If you do almost nothing but use a text editor with everything else off one may well get 10hrs out but I've never tried it.I got the 13 inch because I prefer something portable and sleek, which the mbp certainly is! The only thing I have against it is that the resolution for the 13\" is very low for a high end laptop these days and you can't fit as much information on one screen as I would like. Typically at work I have to plug in an external monitor (non-apple, which displays to the full capabilities of the screen without fault or hassle).Otherwise the computer sometimes runs a little hot (though nowhere near as hot as my old ibm).It is in summary a very good laptop - the best I've ever owned.

It seems as though Apple hit the mark, especially in the education realm, as this laptop and it's various versions (15, 13, different speeds and revisions) are almost ubiquitous in the classroom.  So much so that the PC users are sometimes made fun of for their choice of computer.I am a power user.  I've had computers from a 386, an Acer 486DX, 2 Toshiba's, 1 compaq, 1 Macbook Pro G4, 1 Macbook Pro aluminum, 2 custom build desktops, 1 Macbook, and now this guy.  The elegance of design, the crispness of the screen, the ease of use of the chicklet keyboard compared to that of the Macbook Pro aluminum, the battery life, the speed....they all add up and you really do notice a far superior experience than on your run of the mill PC laptop.  True, the laptop is not the state of the art with processor and high end graphics card, but Apple pays attention to power draws and makes that a hug portion of their decision when it comes to upgrade options.Thus, I can't justify the computer on the basis of sheer processor power and gadgets alone.  If you're a user that needs all those features (TV tuner, multicard reader, and state of the art graphics card), then this computer isn't for you.  I would suggest looking into an HP Envy or, if you have money to burn, buy a ridiculously overpriced but jaw dropping Alienware laptop that will probably only get you 2 hrs of battery life.  The point is, there are lots of options out there but what this computer and it's macbook product line offers is a computer experience that will literally change the way you do everyday things, everything from web browsing to managing files.Pros:- Multi-touch pad is amazing.  I've gone back to use my old Macbook Pro aluminum that I sold and absolutely hate using that trackpad.  I HAVE to be able to use all fingers now.  My productivity depends upon it.- The screen, although not the highest resolution screen out there, is incredibly bright, responsive, and crisp.  It's the best screen I've had to date.- The keyboard is amazing.  I love how they've designed it.  Not only does it look good, but it's incredibly easy to type on and makes other keyboards inferior.  The backlight is great and I can't imagine how annoying it would be to have a laptop without a backlight after using it.- The battery, despite everyone saying it's not up to what's advertised, is good up to 7 hrs and I'm fine with that.  I easily get a full day's worth without charging it and I have to watch lectures and do writeups on it throughout the day.  The battery hasn't ever let me down.- The OS.  Right now Windows has a product very comparable to the experience of OS X and I actually do enjoy using Windows 7 on my desktop (LOVE the new window sizing scheme!), but at the end of the day I feel more comfortable getting my work done under OS X.  The ease of use, the availability of everything, the snappiness in speed, Spotlight, and Time Machine all make me prefer OS X over Windows 7.Cons:- I do wish it had a better graphics card, but I understand Apple's reasoning and it is, after all, a 13\" laptop.  It runs Call of Duty: Modern Warfare just fine on full.- I hate it how Apple fills up the memory slot's with 2Gb sim's and not one 4Gb sim.  If I wanted to max out the memory at 8Gb, I'd have to buy two new 4Gb sims.- The harddrive is a little left to be desired.  It's not terrible, but it's not great in terms of size.  I would also like to have had a faster drive.- Price.  This is what gets everyone every time.Ultimately, if you have $1400 saved to buy a laptop and you're looking for a good, dependable laptop that will honestly last you for the next 3 years before you might see lag in performance with the greatest and latest software, I would HIGHLY suggest this computer.  It truly is the best laptop I've ever owned and there is a reason why it comes so highly recommended by students.", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "THESE MACHINES R WORTH THE PRICE", "Author": "Big \"Harry Kintama\"", "ReviewID": "R13VZ5RHIB8CP4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Between using the Macs and PCs, it's always been Macs, hands down.

I remember passing on buying one of the early Macintoshes via the student discount and using an IBM AT or Korean Leading Edge PC to write many of my papers in one of my universities' \"computer clusters\".I've had good PCs at work, but again, the hair on the dog gets pretty long when the upgrade cycle for your machine is 24-36 months, by the time you get past the 18 month mark, your machine starts slowing down from IT patches and software upgrades...As far as my personal life goes, I've always lived on the trailing edge of technology as far as computers go, and stuck with PCs even though I experimented with OSes - I've tried Linux, and I stuck with OS/2 until IBM gave up on it when it released the Warp version.My first personal PC was a PS/1, and then I had a clone box that I swapped out the MOB 1x... when that died, I got a cheap Compaq/HP laptop that started blank/blue-screening < 1 year (I only paid $400 for it). I replaced that with a Toshiba Satellite Vista laptop, again around the same price, and less than 6 months or so similar issues - sticking keys, having to constantly download OS and software patches, mysterious system lockups that required hard reboots, USB devices disappearing and not being recognized for no good reason...I've also spent 1000s on software and hardware upgrades during all of the years I've owned PCs.Anyway, as an avid music listener/musician, I've had an iPod since 2007, and absolutely love it, and when the Toshiba started electronically farting with stuck keys, I thought \"Why not Apple?\" Yes, its more expensive, but you get what you pay for, and I've been very pleased with this machine. Quality just permeats the product. It boots and shuts down much faster than a PC, and seems fairly crash proof. There are differences in the way you do stuff in Windows vs. MacOS, and those take a little getting used to. I definitely think the MacOS handles music (I also bought the machine for Garage Band and I use a third party software called Band in a Box) and media much much better than Windows does.We'll see about reliability issues, but so many of the Mac users I talked to noted they'd had their machines for years and they were still going strong, and Macs actually still fetch decent used prices on eBay, that says a lot right there, whereas you can't give a used laptop or PC away. I figured why not drop $1500, because if the machine lasts more than 3 years, that's about what I'd be spending on a new laptop on a year basis ($500+$500+$500) with all of the aggravations of moving files, software, etc. built in.If you are coming over from Windows, you are going to love not having to screw with USB drivers anymore to have your devices recognized...", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Deal, Good Delivery time", "Author": "Anise", "ReviewID": "REPJJ15W87LM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have Bought the Macbook Pro 13\", everything was fine and smooth.I'm writing this review from my new Laptop now..Best Regards,Anise", "Date": "November 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Apple is the Beemer of electronics", "Author": "Steve C", "ReviewID": "R372A5CC0ZF2G6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Having used a PC my whole life, trying to use this laptop was a nightmare.
