But for the most part it is true. Yes the first day or so I had some choice words for my new MBP. But now, everyday I am more amazed what this thing can do. A lot of thought went into the design of this computer. The speed of just shutting it on and off his truly remarkable. In the morning I would turn on my HP, make coffee, and if I was lucky it might have made it to the desktop by the time I got back. I then clicked the Firefox icon and went to the bathroom and read War and Peace. When I got back I was on the internet. I'm not even going to mention email. Suffice to say. It wasn't quick.The other day I went on my wife's HP. It was like stepping out of a Ferrari and into a Model T. Most people, me included, get hoodwinked into believing you get more for your money with a HP, Dell, etc. Yeah you get a bigger screen, more Ram and a bigger Hard Drive. But you also get a plastic piece of crap, constantly updating itself with more crap, capable of catching more viruses then an epidemic of Swine Flu. Honestly; I don't know how the competition stays in business.The bottom line. When you have one company who designs the computer, the OS, browser, and virus protection, built on a rock solid Unix foundation you can't go wrong. My HP ran Windows XP Firefox browser and McAfee virus protection. It was agonizingly slow with loads of compatibility issues.To sum it up...The Mac and the HP... the difference between a spaceman and a caveman.Apple's slogan should be...

But then I read a few articles suggesting that this laptop is such a good investment, comes with tons of software, and so solidly built that it'll last for years.  Plus with Apple computers you can use the slick, affordable iWork, instead of the expensive Microsoft Office.  You can still get Office for Mac, but Apple's iWork is so much more impressive.I can barely begin to explain what I love about this laptop, but I'll share with you some of my favorite features.Aluminum \"Unibody\"Not only it the laptop stunning to look at, but it feels strong and durable.  No flimsy plastic casing.TouchpadNot only does the extra large touchpad feel amazing, but it's been a huge boost to my productivity.  Apple really has perfected the multitouch experience.  Two fingers for smooth scrolling, touch one finger to click, two fingers to right-click, four to the side to switch apps, four fingers down to view/access all open windows.  Efficient and fun!Battery Life7 hours on a single charge, according to Apple.  My battery actually lasts longer, and a recent Wired article says their tests got an extra hour of battery life.  Now I can finally get a full day's work on-the-go.  And it's perfect for long flights.SoftwareTurn it on and it works.  Starts up fast, feels nice, looks good, responds well, works perfectly; such a different experience from Windows PC.  Imagine the wonderful, intuitive iPhone/iPod experience on a laptop.  Amazing.Backlit keyboardSuch a nice touch.  When the sun goes does, the MacBook senses the light change and the keyboard begins to glow.The list goes on and on.

Words cannot do justice to the experience you get with the Macbook. Everything is there where you expect it...instantaneous. I am talking about user experience something which windows still need to learn.Cost? Well I would have paid double to get this. Think of how much you spent trying to upgrade your pc, the software needed to do anything, virus protection and it adds up. Still do you get what you need?Its there... ready when I need it. Open the Macbook and press 2/3 keys and you are inside the application you want. Few more keystrokes you are done with it. Now close the lid and you are on your way in less than 5 minutes.Well..

Im kinda paranoid about destroying things so ofcourse I google constantly to see if everything im doing is right. Im still learning how to calibrate the battery every month (you should do this) and I try not to press to hard down on the keys, cuz I type really fast and have a tendency to press with force. I especially love the trackpad. I had a Logitech mouse for $50 and right now its getting dustbunnies in my drawer! I most especially love the backlit keyboard becuz I am a nite owl, I like to type in the dark and this is just great for me. I bought a purple Speck Satin seethru case to go with (love it) and it working quite well, I might add.I am glad I didn't buy the upgraded version, becuase I saw cheaper prices for 4GB Ram and 500GB HDD.

I still can't believe I paid the premium price to have a Mac, but I am glad I did.  The only fault I see with this laptop is that it will get hot if you are using it alot for photo/video work, It's not unbearable but it does get hot.  Battery life is good, not sure 7hrs, but I always have WiFi on.  I also purchased VMWare Fusion for the Mac so I can run Windows Vista or Win 7 if I need it,  I've not really seen a need to use it much but the software does a great job.If you are on the fence and have the $'s go for it!

I've had it for about three months now, and I've used it practically every day.  It takes a week or two to get fully used to all of the features, but now I have a hard time using a Windows computer.  It really is easy to learn how to use though.  And so far I haven't experienced any sort of problem whatsoever whether it's with the OS or any of the software, it just works.  That's just it, from the moment you hit the power button, everything is pretty much 100% ready to do anything in 25 seconds.  The LED backlit display is beautiful, compared to a matte finish LCD and a high-gloss LCD, this one hits a home run and it's easier on your battery.  The one thing I sort of didn't like too much, was the exaggerated 7-hour battery.  It will probably last you 7 hours-or even longer, but only if you're doing the most basic computing and on the lowest screen brightness and the backlit keys off.  But if you have maybe a few tabs open in Safari or Firefox, and a few other applications with the lowest brightness, you should get about 3-4 hours, which is not bad.  Also the graphics are good, but not amazing.  It is amazing, however, that it's actually an integrated graphics processor, rather than a dedicated.  For instance, I can play The Sims 3 on the highest possible settings and I can still get a playable 15 FPS.  And finally, the casing.  Many people say that you shouldn't buy a computer because of it's casing, I think it's well worth mentioning at least.  It's a metal shield around the inner components.  Would you rather have a plastic one or a metal one?  The plastic will shatter/crack when under pressure or if it drops, the metal one might dent so this is a good thing.  I've seen MacBooks drop and they are still running when you open it back up, so it kinda gives you that reassured feeling that you that you have a reliable and a dependable computer.I don't regret buying it one bit, I realize what sort of Windows computer I could have gotten with $1300 (with tax) but, like I said...it's a computer that works, it's light, durable, beautiful.", "Date": "December 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Apple MacBook Pro 13\" 2.53Ghz Core2Duo 4Gb 1067 - ROCKS", "Author": "Gaurav Kishore", "ReviewID": "R3DSD5O3H49VKG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first Mac laptop, absolutely love it, 100% satisfied with it in every way.

Two months after that the problem was with the internal microphone, and again bring it to apple to fix it...now, just as the one year guarantee ended, another important problem, this time with the magic pad. This time, however, not even apple knows for sure what is happening, and if you browse on blogs, you will see that a lot of people experience the same as I am now experiencing, and no clue to how to solve. I am sure that whoever read this and had not experienced any problem will say I was not lucky with my equipment, that they NEVER had any problem, etc...but the fact is, apple does have a lot of problems, with a lot of its customers and, what is worse, the problems in a Mac, when they do happen, are ALWAYS harder to fix than in a PC.

Instead, my wife fell in love with the MacBook Pro.Latest model with SD card, firewire.  I purchased this refurbished off the Apple site, and am using the savings to buy Applecare protection from Amazon.  Amazon's price is great.As a longtime and reasonably proficient Dell user, I am stunned by the quality of the Apple. My refurbished Dell is almost 5 years old, but I have suffered plenty. Ignore reviews about long learning curves on Apples.  Simple to use.  I had never used a wireless connection, but the Apple immediately walked me through the connection to my Linksys router.  Worked immediately.  My wife can now surf from the kitchen table - her big wish. I did have a few questions.  I sent Apple a support request, and they immediately called me on my phone. Sixty second wait on the callback. Person was clearly a US type-with perfect English. A wonderful treat.I had a few other minor questions, and we drove 45 miles to the nearest Apple store.  What a treat.  A tech person immediately showed us how to do a few things, like enlarging the print.  I then realized that since Apple designs both the hardware and software, all questions are handled in one call - or visit.  No jumping between hardware and software providers.  If any problems do arise, I can drive down to the Apple store, and they will fix it while I wait, or send it away for me.  As I said, I am buying the Appleware Protection plan, because it also provides 3 years of phone/store support.Another treat-I tunes. I never expected to use it. As I said, I'm retired, and never could understand why I Pods were so popular.  I do now.  I have downloaded 20 of my favorite songs, exactly the songs I wanted, many hard to find. Even one great Robert Palmer video song, Simply Irresistible, for $ 1.29. I don't use my computer with productivity software, but I'm sure having a blast.  Love the built in mouse.

I have seen this notebook heat up to over 170 degrees on the processors side. This reduces battery life. I am yet to use this computer for 5 hours consecutively, but I have used it for at least 3 and it still had juice. This is a rather informal review but just know that it is still great, it is still fast, and beautiful...but it heats up a lot and the aluminum helps, but you can feel the heat just beneath you.

I had high expectations for this model and the actual product didn't meet them.  Also, the firewire port is 800, not 400.

It sounded simple, and I did it. I waited 1 hour, and 2 and 3, and then called Amazon again, and they said to wait couple of hours, and I will get it. I waited until 12AM Sep 5th (since I wanted to go out of US, and needed to do this before leaving), and they assured me by the time I am up, I will have that number in my in-box.Next day there was nothing from Amazon, so again I called, and this time I was assured by 5PN that day the number will be there. At 6PM it was there, and I used it and made a 1279 dollars purchase.Amazon tried to put 3 charges, each 1279 through my Bank, therefore they stopped all of them, and I did not know about any since I was out of the country, until Sep10th(which was the date, I was suppose to get the shipment delivered to my house0. Again I had to call Amazon for almost 6 more times, and every time some joker was telling me, that let me know your Bank phone number, and we will take care of it, and for 4 days this went on, and on. I called Amazon again, since daily I was getting e-mails from them saying my order has not gone through, because of insufficient funds in my account. I called, and asked the rep what is going on, and after her trying not to answer my questions, she said let's call your Bank, and talk to them directly(I am not sure if you have tried to call your bank directly these days or not, but it is not an easy task) but we did anyhow, and my bank's rep told the Amazon rep, that the reason the charges were denied, has been the quantities of them, and she said in the past 2 days alone, Amazon has requested 5 times, the amount of 1279 dollars(If you remember I bought it a 500 gift certificate, and the true charge should have been 779 dollars), so I told my bank give a verbal OK with Authorization number to Amazon Rep and let's get this thing resolve once and for ever, and when she tried, Amazon refuse to accept it, and told me that I have to cancel my order and order this again, and when I asked her to let me talk to your manager, and why did you ask to have my bank online, if you knew that later on you will refuse their Authorization, she put me on eternal hold, and then I got cut off.So I tried to cancel my order, but the system would not let me, so I called Amazon again, and asked to talk to a manager, and every time you call you have to tell your whole story otherwise you will not get an opportunity to talk to a manager. When I told him that, he said no Robert, you do not have to do this, and we are putting your order through, and charge you 779(since I did lose 7 days by then I upgraded the shipping, and after 500 dollars gift certificate, my charge out of my bank account raised to 809.00), and he said he will e-mail me about our talk, and this amount, and do not worry about anything Robert, TRUST ME.Believe it or not I never got an e-mail, and on Sunday 13th, Amazon went ahead and charged my account more than 1300 dollars, and since I did not expected them they will do that, and I got assured the total amount after 500 dollars gift certificate will be 809.00, I went ahead, and used my ATM card for other purposes. Amazon by doing that caused my account to be over drafted and I ended up getting 100 dollars bank fee for that reason alone.So what did I do today? Guess. Called Amazon again (this was my 17th times, since Sep 4th). They said that Amazon Gift department somehow missed giving me credit for 500 dollars, and therefore 1309 dollars went through my account instead of 809 dollars, and it will be 10 days until they can resolve this.I wish Jeff Bezo will know these types of horror stories happening to his loyal customers. I have been Amazon's loyal customer, and even though we are not rich, we bought over 3000 dollars of goods in the past 3 months from Amazon. I swear to my mother's life, that no longer will I do business with Amazon, after this past 10 hell days. I have spent over 19 hours on the phone, and have been so upset the other day, I thought I am having a heart attack, and guess what it is still not over, and I have to deal with it another 10 days. Just for one deal. Then people say what is wrong with corporate America? This is it, lack of care, and do not giving a DAM what your customer feels, and goes through. If I would have decided the other day to go through Apple (even though their laptop price was 10 dollars less), and was not a loyal customer of Amazon, I would have been using my laptop 1 week, and already was used to it, and on top of that I would have not spent 1 hour with some Joe Shmo on Philippines, day in, and day out.SAHAME ON AMAZON to take of customers like me and my wife this way, SHAME.Robert Shah", "Date": "September 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Toyota Syndrome", "Author": "James S.
