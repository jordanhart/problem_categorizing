It wasn't listed under Laptops in Amazon and I've never seen an ad so I initially bought an HP ProBook 4525S. That has a screen that was DOA. No problem with the refund but we decided to go with a different manufacturer.I knew of Fujitsu as the maker of high quality scanners and saw this laptop reviewed with a slightly different configuration in an Asian computer magazine. I was very surprised that a search showed Amazon as a seller, much less the lowest priced seller.Based on Fujitsu's overall reputation and the written specs I took the plunge. So far I am very pleased. The build is very impressive for the money, much better than the laptop I returned. If the specs and price suit you I strongly recommend it. The only drawback I see is the mirrored black case which shows finger marks.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "My Fujitsu Lifebook is a POS as is their customer service.", "Author": "P. Davenport", "ReviewID": "R6FPZOBFAPLJG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I will never buy a Fujitsu PC ever again.  Last year I bought online a Fujitsu Lifebook AH53x with Windows 8. Windows 8 didn't help usability, but that's not the issue. Less than 1 year later, the screen went out and needed replacement, and now the hard drive is not recognized no matter what I do.  Tried everything, even replacing, still not recognized. Drive works fine in other computers and via USB, so there's some kind of issue with the controller, hardware or BIOS, but the diagnostics don't report anything wrong even though only the DVD drive is recognized.  Refuses even to recognize it as a USB hard drive.  Contacted Fujitsu over a month ago explaining the issue.  Only response I got was that they received my request and it is being \"processed.\"  Never again.", "Date": "October 12, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005BNYFHK"}}
