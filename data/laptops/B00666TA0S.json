Solid LT, no camera or fingerprint reader (never wanted either one, so that's fine for me)disappointed that it didn't have a lighted keyboard (didn't realize it was a specification (my last one, just came with one). About 3 weeks after I got it, it wouldn't boot. Bad HD was called out in the on-board diagnostics. Emailed them through Amazon and they immediately sent a new drive out to me, preloaded with the OS. Plugged it in and transferred all data to the new drive. (Unable to access the old drive through USB and external case, so it really died)! Asked about a larger HD upgrade option, since they were sending a new one anyway. Figured a few bucks more to upgrade from 750GB to a 1TB drive, but 750 is their largest. They did offer to load the OS onto any drive that I purchased and sent to them. I figured 750GB was good enough for now.Definitely were prompt in delivery of LT and again with replacement drive. Very helpful in both sales and service. (I had a question about specs not matching the item shown on Amazon. After clicking on a 320GB LT, this one showed 750GB and no camera in the detailed specs. My Email was responded to the next day with item list # and what it actually had. I immediately ordered it.)Recommended!", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "awsome", "Author": "James N.", "ReviewID": "R368UQARM0V3M4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The product is fantastic.
