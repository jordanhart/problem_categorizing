{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fantastic price for a laptop! Great for College and on the go!", "Author": "The Shadow Warrior", "ReviewID": "R22JEPNY8YRP5K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At first, I didn't like the fact the Windows 8 was installed onto the machine. However, I ended up liking it in the end when I found out how useful it was for school and homework. As a 19 year old college student, I find this perfect for school projects and note taking. The multi-tasking and Metro options of Windows 8 make these things simpler. The battery lasts 5-6 hours on power saver, and has lasted me through 3 hour lectures!If you want a laptop that looks nice, has a webcam and boots up in less than 30 seconds, I definitely recommend this laptop. Only had it for 2 months, and I just love it! In fact, I am typing with it now!*If you are a Gamer, you might like this laptop for \"mild\" games, but this machine won't handle the best. With the Windows 8.1 update however, it has given Gamers a chance to tinker with their graphics settings and some other cool stuff.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "College Bound Daughter", "Author": "Christopher T.

I love that it boots up quickly, the battery life is pretty good with about 4 hours depending on what I am doing. I use this for school and day to day web surfing, chatting etc.It is very light weight, the screen size is large enough to work comfortably and the keyboard also works very smoothly. I have used other laptops where the keys stick or you have to really hit them hard to get certain letters, but not this one. This one works perfectly.I was  bit worried about windows 8 at first because of all the negative reviews that are out there but I must say that I absolutely love it. Once you get used to it, which really does not take long, you will realize that it a great operating system.Finally the pricing on this laptop makes it a very good deal.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not bad for the money", "Author": "Joseph A. Dobbert \"mplsjoey\"", "ReviewID": "R3B77U2L8IS5G3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this as my budget machine. It wasn't meant to compare with my custom desktop that I dumped a ton of money in - just to be a way to surf the web and work with clients at their office. It meets my needs. WiFi doesn't always work when it wakes from sleep - you have to put it in airplane mode then take it out. It hiccups and hangs up now and then, but it's an AMD so it does the best it can. Overall, a good bargain laptop that I won't cry about if it's lost or broken.", "Date": "September 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Little Laptops", "Author": "Rafael Nieves", "ReviewID": "R11WYXFAPIK089", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've initially ordered 10 of these then in this last order another 8. They are great little laptops capable of handling anything the average user is capable of throwing at it. The full-sized numeric keypad is great for those users who kill it on spreadsheets. Orders from this seller are always quick to get sent out and arrive in good condition packed properly.The only complaint I have about this HP Pavilion Sleekbook is the fact that during the set up process you set up the Wifi password and it successfully connects to the wireless internet connection but when you restart the computer the password you entered is not remembered and you actually have to go into the network adapter settings and enable the adapter and reenter the password. This only happens the after the first restart on about half the laptops I've installed. It's a weird bug and one that may throw some beginners for a loop. Other than that excellent buy.", "Date": "February 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "great", "Author": "Ian mcCoy", "ReviewID": "R2BIP2L0NPDYYQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this laptop is a good laptop for surfing the web and making documents and just doing general things.
