I'm still figuring out how to maximize battery life.Pros: Thin, light, good build, keyboard and trackpad work good (need to adjust sensitivity to your liking) Screen is sharp enough and bright enough, wifi works great, hybrid sd card works great, boots up in 10 seconds from cold. and 2 seconds from hibernate. shuts down in less than 5 seconds. (you'll have to do some windows 8 speed tweaks to optimize it, i suggest advance system care which has lots of startup options).cons: fan noise, fan is constantly running, slight heat from the bottom on the hard rive side.", "Date": "August 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Super Light Acer Aspire UltraBook Laptop", "Author": "Matthew Shea \"peacefultimesbooks\"", "ReviewID": "R1I2O5YKIBD1RZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this Acer Aspire S3 13.3\" Ultrabook Laptop for my business. I needed something very light as I have to hold constantly at a client's home or business. Didn't need anything fancy or super high-end as I use this mostly for my proprietary software, email, social networking, etc. The power of the Intel Core i3 processor is perfect, along with 4GB RAM. Boots fast because of the mSSD drive, 320GB hard drive is more than enough storage. Will be upgrading the hard drive to an 256gb SSD soon. Screen bright & clear and audio is okay, don't really need as I don't use this for entertainment. I do however use for video and PowerPoint presentations to customers, perfect for my applications.PROS: Super lightweight; Bright screen; fast enough to run all MSOffice applications, video, photos, etc. Bluetooth is a great bonus.At this low price point, you can't go wrong. Don't buy more laptop than you need, most are overkill- especially since most people only use them for the internet, social networking, watching videos & playing music, and Office applications.CONS: Batter life absolutely stinks, maybe 3-3.5 hours max., even with brightness on low. Got about 4hrs when not using WiFi which I don't need anyway when with customers.Overall a perfect laptop for my business. Price is low and quality is great.

Light, thin, very portable.  Set up is quick, easy and painless - didn't even need to look at the instructions.  Connected to my network without any effort whatsoever.Contrary to many other reviews, I find Windows 8 easy to use and intuitive.  I think I may like it better than previous versions of Windows.  But, if you don't like it, it's easy enough to just click on the Desktop tile and never use the tiles.  Easy peasy.It boots up quick and does everything I need it to - fine for surfing the web, and for my writing software.  I haven't tried anything resource heavy, but I expect it would be great for any normal office usage.The only complaint I have is the battery life is very short.  The Amazon listing didn't say anything about it, but a PCMag.com review said that Acer listed it at 5.5 hours, and their tests gave it 4 hours 45 minutes.  The computer itself says it only has 2.5 hours when fully charged, but it actually runs down much faster than that.  I would say the battery only lasts 1.5 - 2 hours, max.  I will update my review if I find a way to improve this. I will be contacting Acer to see if there's a way to fix this problem.Otherwise, I'm very, very happy with this machine!  Exactly what I was looking for for a reasonable price.", "Date": "October 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cheap and Light - A Steal at Reduced Prices", "Author": "Ryan", "ReviewID": "RUXA0K9AINIPL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I Got this on a budget deal for around $350 after my last machine met its unexpected demise, and for that price I couldn't be happier. At the original retail price, however, I would never have bought it. The machine doesn't meet the high standards of some of the other \"ultrabook\" price point laptops, but it is also significantly less expensive, especially with recent reductions. However, the form factor is thin, and the laptop is incredibly light in my bag.Performance is reasonable. If you're coming from a high-end system, you won't be particularly impressed. If you're coming from a netbook/budget laptop, you might be impressed. The i3 processor goes a long way over the celeron or atom found it many other machines. The soldered-in 4gb of ram is a bit of a bummer, but usable nonetheless. With the stock configuration and Windows 8 the SSD/HDD combo is used well to accelerate the boot, hibernate, and resume functions. Build quality is so-so. The case is plastic other than the metal lid top (which looks nice), so you palms rest on the plastic-y surface while typing, etc. The screen came preconfigured with a bit of a blue hue to it, but I was able to re-calibrate it using OS tools rather quickly. Screen viewing angles are not particularly great, as to be expected, and at higher brightness things can look slightly washed out. Beyond that, however, the display looks great. The keyboard keys are a little shallow, but not impossible. It'll take a day or two to get used to them if you haven't used really shallow keys before. The trackpad was surprisingly great - with some configuration. By default it came with \"natural\" scrolling enabled (read: apple reverse-scrolling voodoo) and some other functions disabled. Two finger scrolling works perfectly (one of the first non-mac PCs I've owned that I can claim this for), and although the trackpad is \"clicky\" (loud) it gets the job done and is bigger than many other trackpads at similar screen sizes.The fan is very loud by stock configuration. Be sure to see other reviews here for a solution from the user forums at notebookreivew - the difference is night and day.I dual boot linux, and the dual boot process was made slightly complicated by UEFI BIOS, but wasn't as hard as it could be. I just had to shrink the C drive in windows to make room for linux, use a UEFI-signed Linux installer (Ubuntu, in this case) and set up my partitions manually. At first I thought my Linux partition would suffer without being able to use the SSD, but up to this point I have hardly noticed the difference. A few notes: brightness control might not work out of the box, but is fixable. Also, fan control is also possible under Linux but the command line tool \"fancontrol\" won't work with the S3's hardware. Instead, check out \"acers3fand\", some custom software for controlling the fan on the S3. All in all, this makes a really strong linux machine.At a higher price, I don't think this computer would have been worth it to me. At the new low prices we're seeing for this laptop though, it's the perfect deal for someone looking at Chromebooks, tablets, and other cheap computing options but want the full experience of Windows or Linux.", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "System couldn't boot and froze at Acer logo screen", "Author": "Yun Zhu", "ReviewID": "R2CJS8P3DDDY78", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After several days' use, the system could't boot, and froze at Acer logo screen.

Screen has decent brightness when unplugged and was perfect for my commuting/travel needs. Unfortunately, it ran slow out of the box and seemed to get bogged down very quickly just doing the simplest tasks (browsing, etc.). Also, and I know this really isn't the fault of the laptop, Windows 8 is a bother - and I'm a long-time PC user. I'm not a fan of the tablet-oriented OS, and even though you can quickly get to the traditional desktop I found that little swipes on the touchpad were constantly sending me back to the mobile homescreen. The touchpad itself is not great and it has an oddly-loud click. The two-finger swipe is also a little off - I prefer the one finger scroll on my current Dell XPS.However, I could have dealt with all of these things if it weren't for one thing: the ever-present noise of the fan. It runs constantly doing nothing but browsing or using a simple program. I tried downloading Speedfan to help quiet it, but the program didn't work on this model. If you are an advanced PC-user you may be able to get into the BIOS to control it, but tinkering with the fan can void the warranty and is not recommended. And who wants to worry about driver and motherboard performance on a new PC?Appearance-wise this was the perfect laptop for my needs but overall it has too many deal-breakers - it's going back.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Required Repair After 4 Months", "Author": "Karen L.
