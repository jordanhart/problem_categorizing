I think this a great lap top and it gets the job done. I kept reading all the negative reviews and i have no idea why there's so much bad press. I have never once called customer service and i ordered my laptop at Dell directly through their website. I have no reason to contact customer service and i never experienced any problems at all with any of my Dell products. I get so baffled when i read all these negative reviews. My Dell products which i have had for years including a Dell desktop and a recently purchased new netbooks have never been a problem. The desk top i have is more than 6 years old and I never have any problems. It runs great. It can definitely benefit from an upgrade in some areas.The Studio line is Dell's midrange laptops. The Inspiron being there low end range for consumers that just need a standard laptop. The Dell Studio laptop is completely plastic and it's a bit on the heavy side in my opinion. Maybe because i am so use to my light weight Dell 10 min netbook that i have been spoiled. This is a good lap top. However, i think the flaw in Dell is that their products can get very pricey very quickly. Especially when you are adding in high end features like 6GB RAM rather than 3GB RAM or 2.99GHZ instead of 2.33GHZ etc. You can get the same thing at HP for probably around a hundred dollars less and their quality feels a bit more refined, polished, and sturdy. That being said if you check Dell's website they do have deals going on all the time especially on holidays. But for some reason the price never seems as low as it should be. If you check periodically you will find yourself a deal. I go to that website religiously and build the exact same laptop that I have and it always comes up to more money. I got mine on a special promo.I really regret getting the green covered case. I didn't realize how bright it would be and once i opened it out of the box - I really wish i purchased the Dark Blue or Dark Purple colored case. It's really way too bright. I like the personalization options of the different colors, but i really do regret getting this bright Caribbean green color. My laptop also includes the backlit keyboard which is great for typing in the dark. It also has touch sensitive controls towards the top of the keyboard near the speakers and i think that's a great plus. The DVD is also an optical drive, so there is no door that slides out for you to pop in your DVD. It's like a Playstation 3 slot. You slide the DVDs in & out.Pros:15 inch screenOptical DVD slot4GB RAM750 GB Memory2.66GHZBacklit keyboard4 UBS slotsHDMI outportSleak shiek designDifferent colored casesWi-FiWebcamCons:Windows Vista (Super Whack)A bit pricey in my opinion (That's Dell for you)A bit on the heavy side", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not the laptop you're looking for.", "Author": "Keegan the Awesome", "ReviewID": "REA2QIC90FO0N", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "If you're thinking about buying a Dell laptop (or any laptop), this isn't the laptop you're looking for.

She uses here Studio-15 in college. Our lap tops came with Vista and that was a headache unto itself. Cannot blamed Dell for that, Microsoft wins the prize on the failures of Vista. Changed to Windows7 and did not encounter any problems since. The lap top is good, works fine, and has not had any problems.My issue is with Dell tech support. I have to contend with foreign accents, some are clear but many are not and occasionally I get some accents that are so terrible, I have to hang up and redial. When I describe my problem, I can hear them flipping through the solution sheets to read down a script. If you ask a question off script, they are really lost in a fog. When the good old American technician was at the helm, they would whip you through the solution so fast and it was spot on. The guys and gals knew their stuff. The adage is true; you get what you pay for. Dell pay for cheap overseas tech support and their tech support is worst than 3rd graders.Back to the topic, the studio 15 is a fine piece of equipment which was complimented by my daughter's college tech support at UNC Charlotte. Just remember, when you buy a computer you are also buying the tech support and Dell's tech support has become awful. It has cause me to reconsider buying another Dell lap top because when I call for assistance, it is what I expect.

They are making computers thinner and lighter which ends up restricting the airflow. This causes internal parts to overheat. The typical result in my computer is that the graphics card will overheat and cause the system to lock up.I have this Dell Studio 15\" with factory upgraded ram and other goodies totaling about $1000 investment. Since the new box arrived at my door a year ago, it has continually crashed and locked-up. Dell support has tried everything under the sun, short of giving me a new computer. This includes sending techs to my house and replacing internal parts like the graphics card, motherboard, etc. Alas, nothing changes. The fan always runs at full throttle within moments of start-up. If I try to watch a video or even if a web-page has anything using flash, immediately graphics card failure occurs resulting an over-sized cursor and a total system lock-up. My only option is to do a hard system shutdown. Disabling flash or other scripts only delays the inevitable.I have owned several Dells in the past and WAS a huge fan of Dell; however, this experience has left me very frustrated and disappointed.

Less than two months old and Dell has had to send out the on-site repair man twice.  The system freezes unexpectedly several times a day and the display goes bonkers periodically without warning, sometimes even going completely blank.  The system can even suddenly stop and shut down (and I do not mean it goes through the shut down procedure; I mean it just stops as if the power disappeared).Dell customer support is a total joke.  First there is the customer run around issues.  Then they sent the repair man the wrong parts and he called Dell directly from our house and had to argue with them as they couldn't figure out which part they were meant to send.  The repair man knew the part but the Dell operator did not know what they were doing.The case is absolute rubbish as well.  The plastic is the thinnest plastic I've seen yet on a laptop and it appears to not be very durable.In addition the keyboard is not good either as already the 'M' key is not registering correctly when you press it.  Sometimes it works and sometime it doesn't.The cooling fan is permanently stuck on full now as if the system can not cool down or something.Dell, replaced the motherboard and the speakers in my wife's Studio 15 already and the system lasted all of one day and is back to it's old tricks.  We've concluded the only way to fix this computer is to get a full refund; which we are in the process of doing now.STAY very FAR AWAY from DELL now.  They used to be good but they are worse than garbage now.  If you buy a DELL you might as well light your money on fire.

This happens to my Dell Studio at least once a day, up to around 10 times a day.  Usually the freeze only lasts for about 30 seconds, but sometimes it will cause an application or the whole system to crash, dumping any data you may have wanted to save.If you go to Dell Support for help, prepare for the runaround.  Dell's whole support system seems like it was designed to be unhelpful--which makes sense given their various schemes to \"encourage\" users to pay for support.  If you try to figure out the problem on your own, you may conclude as I did that the cause lies in the BIOS (yes, the one installed by Dell).  Fortunately, most manufacturers have updated BIOS files available for download from their official sites.  Unfortunately, on the Dell site, the link is connected to the wrong file, so you have to find the right one yourself.  And then, when you finally download the right file, you will find that the enclosed program has multiple bugs & won't update your BIOS after all.  As far as I can tell, there is NO WAY to update BIOS for my Dell without paying, which to me seems outrageous.I got this Dell because I read some great reviews online.

I EMAILED DELL & DEMANDED A REFUND, I WAS DELT WITH BY A SO CALLED MANAGER WHO REFUSED TO INFORM ME OF HER LOCATION, HER SUPERVISOR OR HER TELEPHONE NUMBER, I WAS TOLD THAT SHE WAS THE LAST CONTACT, LIKE SHE OWNS THE COMPANY OR SOMETHING. SHE TOLD ME TO ACCEPT THAT THE COMPUTER WAS FAULTY AND THAT DELL WERE NOT OBLIGED TO GIVE ME A REFUND.

Just four months after I bought it, it began running very loudly and overheating. I contacted Dell support, and they sent a technician to replace the heat sink, fan assembly, motherboard, and battery. They essentially told me that they didn't know what the problem was, so they were just going to replace everything and hope for the best. It did work for a while after this, although occasionally it would still make the whirring noises, especially with a cd in the drive.The computer is made of very cheap, flimsy plastic, and all of the plastic around the power button that is (very stupidly)located on a external hinge had already broken off. I was literally holding it together with tape, and a friend I know with this computer had the same problem. Then one day, just about a month after the one year warranty ran out, it would not turn on at all. I assumed that maybe the wires going to the power button had been damaged, since they were exposed. Instead, when I took it into my local computer repairman, I was told that my motherboard was totally shot, and apparently ordering parts from Dell is difficult and very expensive. Thus, just barely over a year after purchasing this computer, I recycled it for parts and said good riddance.Horrible. I will never buy a Dell again; next time, do yourself a favor and get an HP.", "Date": "June 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Avoid This Dell Machine", "Author": "Gregg S. Nichols", "ReviewID": "R3033JVJNLMTBH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This machine is now 2 years old. While still under warranty, the hinges cracked. Many people have encountered this issue.After talking with two customer services reps and a supervisor (explaining the situation in detail), Dell told us to send it in for warranty repair.Once it got to Dell, they called and told us we had \"damaged\" the machine and wanted to charge us $180 to fix it. We did not authorize service. We told them to send it back.It came back dirty, the hinges were cracked worse than before, and the OS needed  to be rebooted from a restore point. They had obviously worked on it without our authorization and then hastily put it back together when they found out they weren't going to fool us into paying them.I didn't know this when we bought the machine, but Dell has been involved in fraud allegations for years now. A simple Google search turns up several articles.We now believe that this bait & switch tactic was their plan all along, as they knew what the issues were (even other Amazon reviewers have encountered the same issues) and they told us to send it in anyway.It's patently obvious that it was always their plan to try and charge us $$$ once they got their hands on the machine. Like petulant children who did not get their way, they sent it back in worse condition than they received it.These tactics are both illegal and inexcusable.We will avoid this company and all its products from now on.
