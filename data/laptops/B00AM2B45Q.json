I've been a Mac only guy for at least 10 years, but I do know my way around the windows infrastructure. This is an i7 machine with a good amount of memory, and it does everything you need.  The screen quality could be a little better although it is sufficient. The auto installed HP applications are a nightmare. I would strongly recommend disabling all of them.  Warning, this machine is not only big but it's also pretty happy I had to switch briefcases in order to be able to carry with me on my last trip. As a desktop replacement it's a homerun but as a traveling computer just keep that in mind.  I bought the refurb and so far no problems.", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect!", "Author": "Chiquito", "ReviewID": "RFTTE3V86AEW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this Refurbished Laptop and it's exactly like a new one!I am using it for 2 month now and no problem!", "Date": "April 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hard Drive will fail", "Author": "Melody Lynn Seelye", "ReviewID": "RPGK1AUD8TEGZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I brought one in February 2013 by August 2013 it was shutting off randomly.  I was told by HP that because I brought it refurbished they wouldn't do anything on it.  By November 2013 it was dead.  I will never buy another HP product and I had been a faithful user for many years.  When I took it into a local repair shop (because the HP customer rep said they wouldn't even look at it) and I was told that it is a common problem with HP laptops and it would cost half of what I originally paid for it to get it fixed because the hard drives are going up in price due to the demand of them from so many failures.  Now I have a $600 paperweight.  It did work really good while it worked though, but $600 is way too much to pay for a product that will work for 9 months.  I have a cheap laptop that I only paid $300 for 5 years ago that still works.", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "I always stick with HP.", "Author": "theknockoutboutique", "ReviewID": "R2LABCW6MY4S4X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the laptop I am using to write this review.

Sadly, this machine is plagued with problems that add up as time goes on. I actually purchased this particular laptop last year, but had to return it right away (less than 30 days) because of a faulty hard drive. Now almost a half-year later, many issues have arisen. I was no longer able to view pictures at first, and there were many software issues. Now not only is the mouse severely malfunctioning, but the sound card is completely out, and like the previous commenter, the HD is having major issues, and I've tried every possible way to fix it, and I consider myself pretty tech-savvy.The previous HP laptop I had lasted me over five years, and that machine serviced me very well. That one had minor malfunctions, but they were all fixed just fine at little or no cost. However, this m7 has turned out to be a disappointment, and just managed to begin to majorly malfunction after a short time. Sadly, I will have to purchase another laptop that is not an m7. That is a real shame because there are so many quality features that the m7 has that most other HP laptops do not have like the backlit keyboard (which is a GREAT touch, but I can now live without it), the extended battery, the Beats audio, and the advanced Core i7. However, all of those features are overshadowed by the phenomenal failures that happen over a short period of time with this particular product. I really gave this laptop a chance, but it has now failed me twice.If you want a top-of-the-line computer with amazing features that may only last you less than a few months, give this a shot. If you want a durable and longer-lasting laptop, then you are much better off looking elsewhere.", "Date": "October 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "best computer ever!", "Author": "Anna DeRosa", "ReviewID": "RD79OY48T3JXH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent a lot of time reading reviews and researching a computer to replace my desktop.

After a plethora of phone calls to HP tech support, they finally determined a hard drive was failing.  I won't even go in to that nightmare (getting the hard drive replaced when I need this laptop daily.)  Anyway, the \"new\" hard drive is really putting out some heat and I'm afraid we're heading down the same path.  I have installed all my software so many times that I have my 20 digit MS product key memorized.I've decided that I'm going to buy cheap, cheap, cheap laptops from this point forward, and treat them all as disposable.  But not everyone can afford that.Other than the failure of the hardware, this is a great Win 7 laptop.  Just too darn bad a critical piece of the hardware is not up to par.", "Date": "September 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Windows 7 Permissions Hell", "Author": "Eric Bentsen", "ReviewID": "R4UXX1CR8NRQA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this at Best Buy during the last month Win 7 Home Premium was on laptops at Best Buy (Oct. 2012). During the first week I visited the Windows Seven Forum and everybody there was complaining that programs were disappearing and becoming unusable. The OS was stealing permissions in the background from newly installed programs and disabling them within a day. I tried to use the recovery partition and that failed, tried the USB recovery stick and that failed. I had to download Windows 7 from Digital River and burn a DVD image; wipe the hard drive including the recovery partition and install this basic Win 7 Home Premium version from DVD. I used the recovery USB stick to add-on all the HP essentials against professional advice on the Forum. My permissions were still all messed up for several months but at least programs weren't being swallowed whole by the OS monster. Trying to copy stuff from my other computer to the hard drive became a nightmare because of permissions though. I tried some backdoor way of copying using Acronis 11 & the Take Ownership program on the menu from an internet download. I wound up with a lot of folders with Access Denied anyway, it's just unfathomable coming from XP where I never had these Permissions problems. The guy at Best Buy warned me that Windows 8 is even worse with Permissions.I bought the laptop in part to burn Blu-Ray disks with my ASUS external Blu-Ray burner, but after some failed attempts with that recently, people on Amazon are being told by ASUS Tech Support that the BD burner won't work on Win 7 (I did get it to work at slow speed on my XP machine), and I should install Windows 8 to get the burner to work with the USB 3.0 ports on the laptop.I have been using the laptop as a desktop replacement, but I do a lot of data shifting so for a couple weeks at a time I have to use my old desktop while the laptop is busy doing backups. I appreciate the much better Kernel Memory in Win 7 when using programs like Acronis 11 (Win XP needed a registry hack to get Acronis not to crash on too little kernel memory).My old desktop only had 3.25 GB of RAM and since I surf all day, my browser uses up 4-5 GB of RAM in a few hours so I have to shut down the browser and maybe even reboot. The laptop has 8 GB of RAM and I still use 4-5 GB of RAM for my browsers, but I'm not running out of RAM and crashing the browser. Browsers have gotten very memory hungry during the last 2 years, to the point of ridiculousness. I'm getting worried already that 8 GB of RAM is not enough, but this computer may or may not handle 16 GB of RAM (I'm researching that now).I've had this laptop hooked up to a 19\" 4:3 monitor via the VGA cable and the sound out to my home stereo amplifier. I tried HDMI out to my TV once and the sound went to the TV and cut off the audio to my amplifier. So if I get a replacement monitor, it had better have speakers if I'm going to use HDMI. I'd rather hear my audio through my stereo anyway so I'd stick with VGA.When I used to use my laptop on a single desk, I would hook up an optical mouse to it because there's no way the typical mousepad is applicable to my computing habits. Now I've got USB Hubs plugged into it so I rarely do anything portable with it.I paid for Geek Squad, but I'm gonna try to install a 2nd hard drive in this and install Windows 8 Pro in it soon. I can use my ASUS Android Tablet to deal with the Metro UI, and use my mouse & keyboard for the desktop area if I can locate the Classic Shell from the internet to get the Start Menu back (Windows 8.1 failed with the Start Menu, June 26, 2013).I've put my ASUS BD Cyberlink software on my desktop & laptop and on both computers my mouse has become very sluggish. I'd like to get that software off of both so my mouse can move unimpeded.I got the Classic Menus for M$ Office 2010 for a few bucks. I cannot handle Ribbons.I've upgraded to Windows 7 Pro two months ago via the Anytime Upgrade for ~$100 so I could get XP Mode (120 GB dynamic virtual drive). XP expires in April 2014. But there are some programs that just work so much better in XP. So gotta get those updates for XP before they disappear.I'd recommend this laptop if you don't mind a crash course into the failure of Windows 7 that takes weeks to overcome, because I don't know that Windows 8 is worth it yet.", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Multiformat media reader Supports Memory Stick, Memory Stick PRO, MultiMediaCard, Secure Digital and xD-Picture Card formats. 3 USB 3.0 ports and 1 USB 2.0 port For fast digital video, audio and data transfer.
