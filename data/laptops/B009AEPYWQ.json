{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Lenovo U310 - Good For the intensive School User", "Author": "Josiah Khan", "ReviewID": "R8604LH5BLNAL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchase DetailsLenovo U310 Graphite SilverIntel Core i5 3317U 1.7 GHzIntel HD 4000 GraphicsI had this laptop as well as a couple others in my WishList for a good while but had problems deciding about which to choose. I got this from amazon on Black Friday for $599.99 and went with the Lenovo due to the Good Company Name and their Well Built Products.The Main Things i needed in a laptop- Good Battery Life (>5 Hours with moderate usage)- Light and Small (Portability is needed as I am on the Go most of the time)- Ability to play 1080p content and run semi-intensive applications and VMs for testing purposes.Initial ThoughtsThe laptop is pretty light and has a nice finish on the outside lid. It feels sturdy and fits perfectly in my Bag.Keyboard and TouchpadWhile typing on the keyboard, you can feel the laptop flexing which can get annoyingwhen typing large documents.The Touchpad on the other hand is nice and large and the left click as well as right click buttons are easy to press. The gestures in the Touchpad software also allow you to scroll with using two fingers so you no longer need to use your fingers at the end of the touchpad to scroll.Re-installation of WindowsI got irritated of the User interface in Windows 8 and reinstalled Windows 7 on the Laptop almost immediately. I didnt care for the interface in WIndows 8 as i mostly use applications external to Windows for school. . I noticed that the SSD built in was used for caching and the OS was actually installed on the Magnetic Hard Disk. I realised that UEFI was also enabled and had some issues getting Windows 7 to install. I wanted to remove UEFI and install Windows 7 directly on the SSD.I Went into the system BIOS, disabled UEFI and then booted a Windows 7 Installation of a USB device. I then deleted ALL the partitions until there was none left. I then installed Windows 7 DIRECTLY onto the 24GB SSD. After the windows installation i had about 5GB remaining on the SSD.Usage and PerformanceHaving Windows 7 installed on the SSD makes the boot time as well as opening of apps extremely fast. Windows 7 performs a cold boot in about 12 seconds and then takes a further 3 seconds to login. Applications installed on the SSD opens up instantly.The i5 as well as Intel HD 4000 Graphics performs better than expected. I am able to stream 1080p content while browsing the web and using skype. This is more than enough for the average student. I mostly have the laptop downclocked in powersave mode and the device still performs like butter while playing music on iTunes and web browsing.Battery LifeWhile iTunes runs in the background with Chrome and MS Word 2010 opened, i get about 5 hrs 30 mins battery life. With just Word Opened i can squeeze about 7-8 hours battery life once the screen is dimmed to the lowest with wifi on. This is more than adequate as i no longer have to walk with my charger to every class.WirelessThe Wireless card equipped with this laptop is an Intel Centrino 2200 Wireless MiniPCIE adapter.At home I have two Access Points (A Dlink DGL_4500 and a Dlink DIR-625) One network is 150N and the other 300N. The Wireless card in the u310 connects to these both networks at 54MBPs for some reason. My older laptop with an AR9285 Atheros Chipset connects at 150MBps and is able to attain transfer rates of 11MBP/s. THe 2200 in the U310 only is able to transfer at 2MBps and only connects to both networks at 54MBPs. WHen i connect to my Neighbour's 300N Network (TP-LINK TEW-633GR) i am able to connect at 270MBPs. I do not know why this is as it is. The range is also much less than my AR9285 but i assume this is due to the material of the U310's Lid. I although bought an external USB Adapter for this issue. I was going to replace the internal card, but there was a sticker on the bottom of the laptop that would voided my warranty if I was to open the device.This card was also VERY difficult to get to work in UBuntu 10.10 and some other older linux distros. I have not tried to see if it works out of the box on any of the newer distros. I had to use drivers from the ipw2200 sourceforge page in order to get this semi-working.Heat and TemperatureUsing Speedfan to attain the Core and HDD temperatures while streaming 1080p content, the maximum the COre reaches is 55 Degrees Celcius. On idle, the core temperature goes down to around 41 Degrees. (This is in an non AC Environment) The fan also is very quiet and can only be heard while you have the laptop next to your ear. THe surface and bottom of the laptop do not get hot and for the most they get warm under INTENSE use. My old HP would get soo hot that i wouldn't be able to even keep it on my lap.SpeakersThe speakers in the laptop are horrible. The audio sounds too mid-ranged and there are no hights. Using the Dobly Software makes the audio sound even more horrible and i am unable to find a decent setting that gives me the true sound of the music. I mostly use my headphones if i have to play any audio on the device. The speakers are located by the hinge which allows the laptop lid to open and close.ScreenThe screen is bright and vibrant and looks good on even the lowest brightness setting. Images and VIdeos on the U310 look clean and 10 times better than my old HP with a 14 Inch Screen (G42-475DX) Comparing images on the U310 and Mac Book Pro 13\" was although a failure as the Screen in the U310 is no match for that of the MBP. THe images on the MBP look 100 times more crisp and the colours look more realistic when compared to the U310.Closing ThoughtsThe U310 is a good device for portability as well as moderate performance. It is perfect for students (With the exception of the Speakers) and I have no regrets buying this device. I although wished there was another wireless card on this laptop (Preferably Atheros Based) and that the SSD was slightly larger.I will keep you guys updated as I continue to use the laptop for school purposes.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Wi-Fi on this model (and all models in the line : U310 , U410) is DEFECTIVE", "Author": "Ryan Judy", "ReviewID": "R2HTDG1ZACG7U8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ignored all of the postings on here about the wi-fi being defective because according to Lenovo there was a hardware change after sometime in July which was supposed to fix the wifi issue.THIS IS NOT TRUE.

(symptoms : It will not work sitting more than 20 feet away from your router, , Wifi speed is much slower than other devices on the same network.How they can still be selling these defective models is beyond me. There are hundreds of pages on forums about the problem yet it is still not fixed.While Lenovo's are usually rock solid machines (at least Thinkpad) I suggest people stay away from this model line.

Nafziger", "ReviewID": "R3RBHQI5WF6WHF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Summary: its an inexpensive, easily portable, plastic laptop with a decent battery and a horrible touchpad.------Pros:Core i5 is fast enough.Keyboard is fantastic.Thin and lightweight.Fan is still quiet and bottom surface is just barely warm even after prolonged (over 1 hour) 100% cpu usage (on all 4 cores) doing video conversion (using ffmpeg) with ambient temp about 70 F.Battery life seems to be about 4-8 hours of internet browsing.------Cons:------The construction is just ok. It is not metal, its plastic. Some of it feels very cheaply snapped together. For example, the lcd bezel snaps on and its plastic. If you twist the screen slighlty you can hear it the typical plastic stress noises. Sometimes if I close the lid by pulling it down on one side, it feels like the lcd bezel might pop out.Some parts of it look like a Macbook pro, but is not build like one. Everywhere the Mac is metal this thing is plastic. In my opinion it feels cheap. The cost is 2x-4x less than a Macbook pro, and it feels about 2x-4x more flimsy than a Macbook pro. So I guess you get what you pay for.The RAM is nearly impossible to upgrade, unless you are willing to pry off the bottom cover with a paint scraper and risk scratching the edges and breaking all the little plastic tabs which snap it toghether. I'm not saying it cannot be done. It can be done. There just isn't an easy way to remove the bottom cover. You have to fordibly pry it off. I actually gave up attempting to upgrade the ram.The touchpad is the worst pointing device I have ever used. An old dirty \"ball\" mouse would be less irritating.Some idiot at Synaptics designed the touchpad so that the left/right buttons are seamlessly on the same surface as the main touchpad area, and the touchpad area extends onto the buttons. So for example, if you try to press the button, you will almost certainy move you finger slightly while doing so, which causes the mouse pointer to move slightly before the click event is fired. This happens in both Windows and Linux, so its obviously faulty hardware design. There are no driver options to disable the touch feature on the surface of the buttons.If you're looking for a cheap laptop thats easily portable, fast, and not interested in upgrading the RAM, and willing to use a USB mouse, then this may be a good consideration for you. Otherwise look for something else.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Portable, effective ultrabook", "Author": "JJ", "ReviewID": "RHHI15QLE1P8Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "UPDATE: After a few uses, there are a couple qualms I have. First, the keyboard is really difficult to type with, and not just in terms of design. The keys don't seem to respond very quickly, and it's a lot easier to make typos or double-cap items (guess the shift key doesn't release as quickly as I'm used to). It's also just uncomfortable.Additionally, what I REALLY HATE is that the F keys aren't the default on the top row - you have to hold down the orange FN key anytime you want to access F2, for example. Otherwise the button just defaults to the lower volume function. Who the heck decided on this?? If anyone knows how to fix it I'll greatly appreciate it. You definitely need to invest in a plug-in outside keyboard.Original review:This met my needs for an affordable, portable ultrabook. It's very sleek with a design that's reminiscent of Macbooks. The screen color seems a bit deeper and less bright than what I'm used to in my Toshiba laptop, even at max setting. In that sense, I don't find it great for watching videos. However, for portable work purposes, it does the job.As others have said, the space bar is oddly small. I have very petite hands, but even I found myself almost missing the space bar on a couple occasions. Overall I think it's worth the price.", "Date": "August 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "LENOVO PATHETIC CUSTOMER SERVICE", "Author": "Siddhant", "ReviewID": "R205JOH5ZDWGLN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Hi!I wouldn't have purchased this laptop, if i knew that Lenovo is so pathetic at its customer service.

I don't regret my purchase [that much]. Obviously, there are going to be trade-offs for all the features floating around the ultrabook universe, so I kept realistic expectations. But anyways, I love my machine. It boots relatively quick, the keyboard is comfortable, the keypad is responsive, and to date, I've had NO problems with my WiFi. I liked its look better than its Sony cost-rival, plus there were some minutia tech reviews said were superior on the Lenovo. Bloatware is minimal (but still annoying). I can't speak much for the audio as I have a main entertainment desktop. The grey is a little dull, I suppose, but it doesn't matter to me, as mine is covered with Pink Floyd and The Oatmeal decals. :)Sidenote: I kept Windows 7 on mine so I cannot speak on how it runs for Windows 8 (which seems pointless without a touchscreen.

So either previous owners received defective models, they fixed the issue, or I got a non-affected machine.After wiping the hard drive and SSD and putting a fresh version of Windows 8 on the machine, it runs like butter, although I'm sure it would run like butter without doing all of that, but I like my computers to be clean. There isn't much space left on the SSD after installing all the necessary updates and whatnot, but you can put a few essential programs on the SSD before you're forced to start installing programs to the HDD. I'll put the rest in bullet form:PROS:  -Design/Build: It looks wonderful, very minimal, very Macbook-esque. It could be better but no laptop is perfect. It doesn't have a lip in the front like Macbooks do for ease of opening, but I open my laptop from the sides anyways so it's a non-issue for me. The keyboard is acceptable. The recovery button on the left side is sort of useless for me though.  -Reliability: The computer does exactly what I need it to do, exactly how it needs to be done. Although I am pretty good when it comes to maintaining my computers so I'm use to that. Windows runs smoothly, haven't gotten around to dual booting Linux yet, but I'm sure it can handle that just fine.  -Speed: With windows 8 installed, for me, it cold boots to the login screen in 10 seconds, shuts down in about 6 seconds, wakes from sleep in about 2, but usually takes another 4-5 seconds before the keyboard is operational to login. I don't notice lag when using the computer either (using the internet, Microsoft office, coding, etc..) The 24GB SSD is definitely useful for stuff like this, and the 500GB HDD is adequate size for all other storage needs.CONS:  -Trackpad: Now, it's not terrible or anything, but it's not a great trackpad either. Sometimes I'll right click and although I press a half inch to the right of the split line, it will left click. It hasn't happened recently but it has happened before. other than that though, it works fine.  -Heat/fan: I notice while playing minecraft, the CPU temp can get into the 70 degree range and the fan becomes rather loud. that being said, it runs minecraft pretty well (60 fps easy if the settings are set pretty low, 30 fps with higher settings, at highest settings maybe more like 20fps) and although it's loud, it spews out the heat quite well, so it does a good job of dissipating the heat. Most other times the fan is barely noticeable and temps are around 40-45 degrees Fahrenheit, which is still higher than I'd like but it's a laptop so you can't expect great temps.  -Screen: I'll preface this by saying that I'm use to my IPS panel I use for my desktop computer. Compared to an IPS panel, the viewing angles on this laptop suck...plain and simple. If you're use to TN panels and don't mind it, then fine. However if you're use to IPS panels be prepared to recede back into the dark ages of screen technology. Deviate more than 15 degrees in any plane from exactly perpendicular to the screen, and colors become pretty distorted. Most of the time this isn't really a huge issue though.So, if you want a good looking computer that will do all your tasks (besides super CPU/GPU intensive) and do them quickly, this computer is a steal. It's super thin, very quiet, and runs great. It doesn't have some of the higher end features of a Macbook, but it's also 4 times less expensive.
