{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Solid notebook for the price but Windows 8 is an ABOMINATION!", "Author": "Finn Riley", "ReviewID": "R13RKXBVREBHD6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "OK so, my new Dell Inspiron 15 i15RV-8524BLK arrived yesterday well packed in a double box. My old portie is a Dell Inspiron E1505 and it has been a decent portie thru the years so I thought I would give a new one a try. I knew I would be replacing Windows 8 when I bought it (I am a tech expert).PROS: The price is good for the hardware you get: 6GB RAM, i5 cpu, HD4000 graphics, HDMI, USB 3, etc.  The build quality seems good, cover is a nice matte finish that doesn't show finger prints, full numeric keypad, keyboard has a nice feel. Fast and quiet with good battery life from the 6-cell battery. It is thin and light.CONS: Hardware has improved so much over the years but the display on this new one is only 1366x768 compared to the 7 year old E1505 with 1280x800. Not a big deal to me but it seems like there should be better default displays by now. I miss the old media control buttons on the front edge of the E1505. Touchpad is very hard to use/get the hang of.The big knock on this machine is true of most portables today - they come with Windows 8. Microsoft has had lemons before but this is such an utter disaster. Why does Ballmer even have a job? I personally hold M$ responsible for the demise of the PC market by introducing this turd. Anything you want as long as it is W8. WTF!??My solution was to just to delete Windows 8. I now dual boot Linux Mint 15 XFCE and Windows 7 Pro. Non-experts should be careful when considering a new machine with Windows 8 on it.EDIT: The touchpad was just too unusable for me (it is my only pointing device). After trying different settings with no improvement I have returned this purchase.EDIT 2: I guess Ballmer *is* leaving Microsoft now!", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice computer - touchpad gives me problems though", "Author": "J. Cox", "ReviewID": "R7IQG6OVPQT1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice computer that does everything I want so no problem there.  I don't game, just use for internet and basic programs.My biggest complaint is with the touchpad.  It is either too large or sits too far to the right or both. The palm of my hand touches it and sends the cursor somewhere else on the page (twice while typing this so far).  Guess I can disable and use a mouse or use better posture.The keyboard is a minor problem and may just be me. I would suggest checking out a Dell at a store though to see if you may have the same problem.  Looks like many models use the same layout.The other thing is Windows 8 (does anyone remember \"New Coke\" or \"Pepsi Clear\").  It is terrible but many have complained about it so I won't go into detail.  It is so bad I almost returned the computer.I have since downloaded a shell that gives the look of older versions of Windows and also have done some tweeks so I have been able to get by pretty well and only have minor issues with the OS now.- J", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good", "Author": "Prasannjit", "ReviewID": "R36383GOD1XF3Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For a basic \"off the shelf\" laptop, this Inpiron is amazing.

I bought it for my brother who's a high school student and it seems to work for his needs such as writing papers and completing projects. Although the battery life isn't too great, it is able to get the job done quickly and with ease. The large hard drive capacity is also a great feature. The disc drive is also a great feature, and is able to run HD games with ease.

I needed one for college and I wanted one that would last me awhile. Of course, I have only been using it for a few weeks, so I'm not sure about long term use yet, but so far it is working well. I wanted a laptop with i5 so it should hopefully last me through college and beyond. Yes, it has windows 8, but it isn't that bad once you get used to it. Once in a while, it can get annoying because the charms menu appears more than I want it to (the menu on the right of the screen to search or return home), but overall, the price was worth it and I really like this laptop.", "Date": "September 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great computer", "Author": "Shari", "ReviewID": "R2X2PMANYDGN04", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Computer works great.
