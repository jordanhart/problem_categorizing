Duhon", "ReviewID": "R30P2GGI9L6UNG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's tough to get used to the change from Vista to Windows 8. But the computer is very light, very fast and doesn't get as hot on my lap as my old, heavy Toshiba laptop. My wife and I both like it due to the size and weight. It is amazing what a few years does in technology.Love the keyboard with a number pad on the right side, like my old computer. Most computers this size don't have this. It is good when you work with numbers a lot like me. And the price was the best deal.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bought it as a birthday gift.", "Author": "Rwong \"Rwong\"", "ReviewID": "R21D4ZRYQA7ANZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My friend needed a new computer so I bought him a laptop.  I was looking for a laptop that was simple to use.  I was glad that when he got it, it was easy for him to use.  I do not know a whole lot about this laptop but I do know my friend was happy and he loves using it.  It does video great and he uses it for simple streaming and surfing the Internet.  Can't complain too much about that!  I thought the Windows8 system would be complicated, but he said it was pretty easy to use.  Great purchase!  I recommend since the price is right for what it does", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "laptop", "Author": "phil", "ReviewID": "R1MCLDEY7JQPF5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Christmas gift for my son and his fianc\u00e9,,,,easy set up,  quickness and the larger 15.6 \" screen were a big hit with them...", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Sensitive mouse", "Author": "Bruce & \"Mary\"", "ReviewID": "R15A8EZI5W28T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The laptop does a good job \"so far\" since we only purchased it on September 21st 2013. The only thing is the mouse is (realy) sensitive hard to get it where you want it without bringing up all that you don't want . Color is good . Windows 8 isn't that bad at all . I would recommend it to someone that wanted a everyday computer but not to someone that wanted to play games on . Good price.", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ugh!

It's extremely slow to do regular, simple things.  I am no tech aficionado, so my fella says he'll look at it.  He says there's probably so much useless crap on it that it causes it to run slow. Seriously, it works so slow that it actually misses keystrokes. And Windows 8... gawd, the horror. Who would have thought any of it was a good idea??  Seriously, this slow piece-of-crap computer skipped three letters in that last sentence.  I only gave it two stars because it even started up.
