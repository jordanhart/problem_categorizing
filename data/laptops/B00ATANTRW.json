First off the device is very slick, its light weight, looks great. It not the easiest thing to open but once its opened it works well. As excited as I was to get this, there were several blaring quirks that I wouldn't expect from a $1500 device.1. The wifi intermittently cuts out.

There is no keyboard light, which have been on all my Lenovo work computer, so it's hard to see the keyboard in the dark.3. When you flip the Yoga and try watching a movie, you'll notice the speakers are now pointed away from you! Even still the speakers are louder than the iPad.Ok about Windows 8The biggest problem with Windows 8 is that it comes preloaded with Junk! The start bar is full on things I will never use and there is a ton of Trial Wear already installed. I was particularly disappointed that MacAfee (part of the company that gave me this Ultrabook) was continuously popping up messages that were very hard to close with tiny buttons and dropdowns asking me to buy a subscription or register when as far as I can tell it comes with a subscription.Once you remove all this and get things set up its actually pretty nice, however moving tiles around is hard work (not nearly as easy as a ipad).There is no Official Facebook App, after some research you can integrate facebook with the People App but when I did this the news feed is different and nearly all the businesses I liked are featured and it is missing a ton of features such as unliking the businesses I don't want to see as full page adds.Also the App are more expensive. Why is Star Wars Angry Birds $5?User profiles are very nice and this is something iPads don't have. I am pretty happy with this feature and you can add picture passwords that work okish.Overall once you get it set up I think it is pretty nice, I don't think the average user wants to spend the time I did to set this up though and I really think it could have been done better.", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice, but two issues...", "Author": "D. Elswit", "ReviewID": "R85K0PV4K80MW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got the Yoga 13 in support of my photography - it allows me to have a fairly high-end computer in a very lightweight package, fully capable of running Lightroom and Photoshop and being able to process 18-21 megapixel images efficiently. I also like the touch screen and tablet mode for watching movies, viewing slideshows or just surfing.  I have two issues though, that have made me sometimes wonder if I should have waited until there were competing models out there.  (This was without a doubt, the most capable touchscreen laptop available at the time.)First, the fan runs continuously, even when the computer is just idling. It can get quite loud when the system is working even modestly hard.  This is apparently a well-known issue and there is no fix at the present time.Second, the trackpad is absolutely awful.  I'm in IT myself and have seen many many laptops over the years, and this compares with the worst, trackpad-wise.  It alternates rapidly between being hyper-sensitive and not responding at all, it skips, it causes random effects... I've sent emails prematurely, deleted blocks of text, moved things around, etc.  After a fair bit of fiddling with the mouse and synaptics settings it's gotten slightly better, but it's still much more effective to use a real mouse with this computer.One other, relatively small item: the right shift and Enter keys are unusually small, leading to some mistyping.On the flip side the screen and video are magnificent, the tablet mode works very well, sound is great, and all in a remarkably compact package.", "Date": "March 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not perfect, but I recommend it.

(Mine has all the same specs save for 8GB RAM - I have 4.)  I love it!  Getting my programs and files transferred from my old laptop was a breeze and took very little time.  I had an issue upgrading Windows 8 to the PRO edition with Media Center.  Microsoft Tech support was outstanding (I know?) at getting me up and running in 20 minutes.I have to imagine you've read all the professional reviews, and now you want to know if it lives up to it on the consumer end.  I haven't used it much as a tablet yet because I plan to do that more in the summer.  Also - one of the first things I did was install Start8 to replace the start menu on the desktop.  Very good software that is well worth 5 dollars. I move this thing around frequently.  Battery life with heavy use is about 4-5 hours.  If I am going back and forth to the machine, then it will last much longer.  Every works really well out of the box, and it's speedy.So here is the one thing I think everyone buying this machine needs to know.  For me, it's not a deal breaker, but it was disappointing, and annoying.  In my opinion, Lenovo needs to redesign the keyboard.  I tried and tried to get used to the cramped shift key, backspace, and enter.  I'm telling you, I missed them every time.  So now, at my workstation, I use a high quality external keyboard and mouse and keep the laptop in tent mode.  I LOVE this setup.  The keyboard on the machine is above average for on the go stuff.  It's outstanding in fact.  It's just not something I want to use for long periods of work.  So really, I have the best of both worlds.  And for the record, I have read reviews that directly contradict mine.  However, I think anyone buying this machine needs to know they might have an issue here.  The keyboard issue seems to improve if you approach the keyboard off center moving your hands slightly to the left.  This is hard to get used to doing.  The other thing is, it would be nice for the keyboard to be illuminated.Compared to my old laptop, this is a revolution.  I am extremely happy with my purchase and would not hesitate, despite the keyboard annoyance, to repeat the purchase.One more item.  I tried using a bluetooth mouse with this machine.  It performed very poorly.  In my research, this seems to be an issue with Yoga and Microsoft Mice.  I switched to a mouse with a receiver.  perfect.You will not regret this purchase unless you are planning on writing a novel in a coffee shop on this thing.  And even then, maybe you will adapt easier than I did.My guess is, Lenovo nailed the future of the laptop.", "Date": "March 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exactly what i was looking for.", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R2EWVSEMNX5QZL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been looking for a windows 8 tablet/touchscreen laptop for development work, i needed a i7 or i5 processer with a SSD as the primary boot drive. I purchased the Acer W700 first but returned it, it was very fast and well made but the high screen resolution made it unusable in desktop mode.I had originally overlooked the Yoga 13 because of the exposed keyboard in tablet mode, but later after reading a review talking about about a second unused hard drive slot in the Yoga 13 - (yes a tablet / ultrabook with 2 drive slots !!!) i decided to give it a try.Lets get the bad out of way first so we can talk about the good in more detail:- My Yoga is going back - it has a stuck/bad pixel, But i am going to get another Yoga 13 to replace it.- Windows 8 - enough said.- Screen can bounce back at ya if you jab it to hard.- Single band WIFI in 2013?- Single channel RAM holds down performance a bit.- Difficult to to a do a clean install - no OS disks or option to buy them.- To many partitions from the factory - WTFO?- touch-pad tries to be jack of all trades but ends up being master of none.The good:- The hardware is superb - build quality is a 10. This alone makes up for all of the negatives.- The screen size/resolution is a good trade off for desktop mode.- Display quality and brightness are both excellent - (even with a bad pixel).- Actually usable in all of its 'advertised positions' and you will find it will adapt and be usable in almost any environment.- If feels so good in your hands - you will find it hard to keep from touching it whenever you walk by.- Very slim and light (for a laptop).- No issues with WIFI as other posters have said.- Room for a SECOND HARD DRIVE (very well kept secret).Tips:- Make your icons on the desktop 'small' - gives the desktop a roomy feel.- Turn off edge swiping on the touch-pad - otherwise it will drive you crazy.- Learn and use the keyboard shortcuts in place of some touch functions (like F4 to close an app/window).- In tablet mode hold it 'hinge up' - this places your hands on the palm rest area on the keyboard (feels good) - not in the keyboard (feels bad).- In laptop mode angle the screen slightly back towards you - this prevents some 'bounce back'. This also helps illuminate the keyboard.- While lack of a lighted keyboard is a negative the keys have a very bold white lettering that makes it easy to see by the screen light.", "Date": "June 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "For those of you that are having wireless connection issues...", "Author": "Russ", "ReviewID": "R3S4KCT77O5FT4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For those of you that are having wireless connection issues... go to the Lenovo com website, click the Support tab, and then click \"Drivers and Software\", then next to \"Quick Path\" type \"Yoga 13\" (without the quotes) and press Enter.Click the section that says \"Networking: Wireless LAN\" and notice that there is a newly released driver (June 6, 2013) that you need to download and install to correct your Wireless issues.Hope this helps.", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Almost the prefect machine", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R5N1JJ1CNF3D8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this so I could have one light weight machine that operates like a tablet when I'm just having fun on the computer, and operates like a powerful laptop when I need to do serious work such as software development.  This device achieves my goals!  I fold it back and use the touch screen when I just reading, browsing the internet, shopping or playing games.  If I'm watching internet based movies, I plug my TV into the HDMI port and watch the movie in 1080p on the big screen.  When I need to get serious, I fold it differently and start using the keyboard.  When I want to work, I switch from metro view to desktop view and it looks pretty much like a Windows 7 environment. ( I did buy StartIsBack for $3.00 so I could have a desktop Wind 7 Start icon, but that's a Windows issue, not device issue)The touch screen works great.  It responds quickly and accurately.  It is very bright and crisp when viewing.  The keyboard feels pretty good under my fingers and I don't have a problem with typing letters.  Finding the arrow, shift or delete key is always a problem for laptops and me.  Sometimes I plug in an external monitor for more screen real estate using the HDMI port.  The USB 3.0 connection supports an external BluRay or harddrive device.  Another USB port provides for thumb drive plug in, or external mouse/keyboard when I'm at my desk and working.A weird thing about this device is the multi-touch pad.  I'm not sure why they have multi-touch pad along with multi-touch screen but it's there.  This caused me a few problems with the pad's buttons before I realized that I had other fingers on the pad also!  Once I figured out how to manipulate it, I discovered I could do things like zoom in on web pages when using Chrome when in desktop mode.Things that could improve: The small right-shift key is a problem.  I keep missing and hitting the up arrow.  It's hard to get into the BIOS until you read up the solution online.  The reason this lost a star in my review was the non standard power cord.  I wanted to buy a second power supply for home only to find that this device uses a different power connection than the other Ultrabooks resulting in higher cost for a second power supply.Bottom line:  I would buy this again and recommend it to anyone needing serious computer and touch screen.Geek info:  As I said, I development software.  That means I install a lot of non standard stuff on this machine including Microsoft  Development Environments, SQL server Express, IIS server, Virtual PC, and a bunch other things.

I don't write many reviews as in general, I am pleased with my purchases.I received this laptop and was delighted with it for 24 hours. Wireless connected although I had read over 78 pages of complaints on the Lenovo support site after I ordered the computer. (I had read many rave reviews, but never thought to search for Lenovo Yoga issues prior to making an order). I did not like the keys being on the bottom, but I knew this going in, and purchased the Lenovo \"sleeve\" that fits over the keyboard in tablet mode.The next day, the wireless stopped working. It would say it was connected but \"limited\" connection. I read every single forum and technical support help guide out there. The network adapter just does not work unless you want to sit directly in front of your router. I also applied every \"fix\" and updated everything out there. Amazingly, I was still willing to wait for a fix of some sort, as I really loved the design and speed of the Yoga.However, the computer started to freeze every time I opened a program. Any program, from a windows 8 app to a desktop application. I decided to return the unit within 2 days, and after reading about so many various issues that rendered the computer useless, decided to purchase a computer with another company.Where the one star review really kicks in is Lenovo's return process. Initially I was pleased with the quick pre paid label. My computer was back at Lenovo by the beginning of August. It has been over a month and my credit card has not been refunded. I received nothing to indicate my return was received. To make a long painful story short, I confirmed with UPS and Lenovo the computer was received within 2 days. It has been sitting there since then. I allowed 3 weeks for them to do something. I have called and emailed several times. Customer service can do nothing for you. Nothing has been done. They do not respond to emails.I've just sent another email.  This computer comes with serious issues that technical support is well aware of, but they do nothing. The complete lack of customer service is appalling. My guess is, they are so back logged with returns of this inferior product they just can't handle returns. Be wary.Good alternatives are the 4th generation Dell XPS 12 and the newly released Sony \"Flip\" series. Or just get a Surface Pro with a good keyboard and call it a day.

Awful is an understatement. These Yoga's don't have a built in ethernet port so your only option for connecting to the internet is through wifi or purchasing an Ethernet dongle. Who wants a cable hanging off a tablet style laptop? The problem with the built in realtek card is that they sometimes connnect and sometimes don't. When they connect, sometimes it will barely work... extremely slow. You also have to be close to your access point. If you are in a business with multiple wifi access points you have to turn your wifi off and back on every time you get in range of another access point. Crazy. Additionally, I've seen on other reviews where it said these laptops have 5Ghz. No they don't. There is a 61 page, as of today, discussion on Lenovo's forum about this problem with still no solution.

So far, weeks later, I have used the Yoga 13 every day and have yet to use the Sony,though the Sony is a beautiful machine. I like carrying the Yoga. Though its screen is smaller than that of the Vaio, the Yoga's screen provides sharp definition,too, and the text supplied, or the screen definition, or something makes it easy to read even and you might use one-half or less of the screen for Word, and the rest of the screen for something else. The Yoga's keyboard is smaller so that if you have giant hands, or lack finger dexterity, you might have a little trouble typing, at first, although I am a male and I have no trouble typing with it at a very fast pace. The Lenovo Yoga continues the IBM tradition for great keyboards. Lenovo bought out IBM's personal computer division.  The relatively small Yoga keyboard should be absolutely no problem for females, and all but the most clumsy males.  At only 3.3 pounds, the Yoga laptop is a dream to carry around from place to place, and always have it with you--and get more work done. The touch pad on the Yoga, though excellent, can easily be shut off, and you can carry a small mouse if the typical touchpad is unpleasant for you. The Yoga runs Window 8, a little bit confusing, at first, but nice. Even though the keyboard is a little smaller, you quickly begin to adjust to it. I like to move around a lot, so carrying a great, but heavy Sony 15.5\" would became a little bit of a burden for me, though I love Sony machines and have bought several over the years. Before buying it, I thought the lightness of the Yoga would not make that much of a difference to me, but somehow it does make a very pleasant difference. I am very happy with the Yoga. The tablet side I am sure is excellent, though I have not yet used it yet as whole Yoga machine is light and I am fast on the keyboard.", "Date": "March 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's OK, could be better considering the price.", "Author": "Mer584 \"mer584\"", "ReviewID": "ROSTOMNQZZIE8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The computer is sleek and pretty sexy but there are a lot of annoying problems.Pros:1)very light weight and portable2)decent battery life, even for streaming video.3)The power cord plugs in nicely and stays in well, unlike the old dell or HP ones that I'm used to.4)The computer is fun to use in different modes and the physical computer converts to these positions easily.5)The screen is well lit, unlike some of the new Asus comps, and the color is good.CONS:1) The track pad is TERRIBLE. It is by far the worst one I have ever used. I had to buy an external mouse to use because it was so bad. I've used different lap tops over the years and have never had to do this. You click on it 5 times and maybe it reads 2/5 clicks. So it's not sensitive at all.....but yet if it's on my lap and I'm typing my shirt might brush it or something and then it gets confused and has a mind of it's own. There is only one button (no set distinction between right and left click besides a hash mark) but sometimes when I click all the way over on the left side it will still read as a right click and vise versa.2) The speakers are not loud enough, and this is even worse in tablet mode. I might have them on 75%, and if i have a light fan on in the room I can barely hear it.3) The backspace key is small and the home key is right next to it. This is down right stupid. Anyone who is used to hitting backspace in the middle is going to mistype on occasion and hit the home key. This is so annoying. You're going along and trying to backspace and suddenly you are typing randomly at the front of the line again and all the words are jumbled together. My boyfriend downloaded an application for me that makes the \"home key\" = \"backspace\" so now when I hit the home key it just works as backspace. But why should I have had to go through the trouble of doing that? People have mentioned having the same problem with some of the other keys as well, such as with the enter key. But I have not personally had a problem with this.4) If you are using anything but the IE app for web-browsing or a windows 8 app the computer will crash/freeze immediately when you switch computer positions (ex: tablet mode to tent mode or whatever). At first I was excited and was switching the computer to a lot of different positions, however, since no other computer does this yet websites aren't ready for it.....so the result? I rarely switch modes because I don't want to screw everything up. This is honestly the most disappointing thing for me because I thought it would be nice to also have a tablet and the way I personally use the computer it's not really reasonable to switch back and forth quickly without risking a browser crash.5)I can't get any internet connection in our second bedroom office space with this computer. My very very old Dell (greater than 5 years old) was able to maintain a connection at that distance from the router without an issue.So what's my true opinion? Even though there are equal pros and cons listed, I have to say I feel like I over paid for this computer to get the \"gimmick\" of rotating it only to find out that switching positions is not something I'm really be able to do unless I want a browser crash. The track pad is literally intolerable and carrying around an external mouse is pretty annoying. I feel like for the price I paid the basics like the keyboard and the track-pad and the speakers should be outstanding...and at minimum not worse than those on the 5 year old computer I replaced this with (and yes the keyboard, the track pad, the speakers, and the ability to connect to the internet are all worse than a >5 year old Dell that was cheaper than this one 5 years ago!!!!). Stupid me to think that technology has advanced in 5 years.I should also say that I haven't used the webcam but have read lots of complaints about it, so I'm sure that it is also terrible.I wish I'd gone for something a little less sexy and a little more functional and saved myself 400-600 bucks.", "Date": "June 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Waste of Good Money", "Author": "Robert J.

I posted here because most of it is true for this model as well and may be useful to some looking at current updated models.The Yoga 13 is an excellent device.  Laptop, Tablet, Mini-HD TV? What's not to like. The current versions seem improved and do not have many of the issues which plagued the earlier ones, or at lest mine does not. No Wifi issues, no trackpad issues, no disk portioning mess. Just a very nice laptop/tablet with a good keyboard, a very good display, great performance and an excellent, innovative design.It's not perfect, no device is, but is a great, functional design, well executed and with solid build quality. If you can get it at a good price, I think you will be pleased with it.Here are my notes on the Yoga 13 i5 model based on my experience so far: A bit larger than I expected, but still reasonably portable and very slim. Great display, not the best ever, but very good. The resolution is perfect for this screen size, leaving text readable, and very good for photos, movies/videos, and graphics. Very bright. Good black levels for videos. Only small criticism is that the blacks do not have as much detail preserved as on the best displays I've used. But not anything awful, most will never notice. I only notice because I have used some truly great displays. Still, a very ncie display and I am quite content with it. Viewing angles are great. Colors are vivid. I think anyone will be very happy with it.Keyboard is quite decent. I am not having any issues. Like many, takes a little while to get used to, but overall feel and action is quite good, I think.  As many have noted, a shame there's no backlighting, but the keys do have bright white on black lettering, so good visibility with even dim lighting. But a backlight would be nice. Guess the bonus is less drain on the battery.Battery life seems pretty good to me. I get 5-6 hours easily and with some \"management\" I can stretch this to 6-7 hours. Can get a full day's use if you are careful, put into sleep when not in use, and so on. Charger is very nice. A new design that is much, much better than almost any other laptop I have used, I really like it. Feel sure this will be the trend for future models. It's very much like a USB connector, but can be inserted either way. Good design.Windows 8 works very well and is very snappy. In fact, this is the best Win 8 experience I have had to date. The Yoga 13 seems to have been designed to make Windows 8 easier to use. I for one am getting used to it and don't feel the need for any add-ons. Have not updated to 8.1 yet (really, feel no need to do so) and still I'm fine. Everything works very well. The touch screen helps a lot, of course. And the great display. Very readable in tablet mode or laptop (desktop) mode. The touch has been flawless for me so far. Very sensitive and responsive. Also, the special function keys help a lot. That and knowing a few key shortcuts like Win+D for Desktop, Win+C for \"Charms\" and so forth. There are dedicated function keys fpr switching between apps easily, closing an app/window, and other common tasks.Performance is very good. Listing windows performance scores below. In daily use, everything is quick and snappy. Boots quickly, shutdown very quickly. Very nice. I really like the function keys being dedicated to things like Airplane mode on/off, Display On/off, volume mute and control, touchpad on/off. brightness up/down, and so on. There's even a dedicated \"Refresh\" key (F5). Nicely done.Windows 8 64-bit Experience Index scores:Processor -- 6.9  (Good. 1.8GHz i5 CPU))Memory RAM -- 5.9  (A bit slow, single channel RAM?)Desktop/Gaming Graphics -- 4.7/6.3  (Fair, Intel 4000 embedded Gfx)HDD -- 7.7 (Very good, decent SSD drive is nice to have)-- Overall, performance is very good in daily use.Trackpad works fine for me.  Actually a bit nicer than many I have used. It's large and supports gestures. The button \"areas\" work fine, as does single and two finger tapping. You can go into properties and turn off things like \"edge swipe\" if they cause you any problems.While watching videos, I switched to tablet mode without a hitch. Pretty cool. In general, I am very happy with the flexibility of the various modes possible with the Yoga 13. I use it primarily in laptop mode, occasionally tablet. But can see stand and tent modes being useful as well, sometimes.The fan does run pretty much constantly, but the fan noise is rather low and not troublesome to me. I only notice it when things are very quiet. They were smart to vent out the back and in use the Yoga 13 seems to stay fairly cool. Some warm spots near the upper left corner under heavy use, but nothing objectionable.All in all, I am enjoying the Yoga 13 very much and think it is a fine unit. It's very nicely designed, looks great, is very portable, has a great display, a fine keyboard, very good performance, and some nice bits like a full size HDMI port.

After calling support and waiting hours to see if it would finally free itself, we tried a hard reboot. We got the machine started again, but I spent hours on the phone with a support rep who tried everything to get it working. By the time I decided to restore the machine to factory settings, I'd wasted more time than it took to reinstall everything from scratch. So I lost 2-3 days of productivity that time.A few months later, the mousepad/trackpad stopped working. I see now that there are lots of other people reporting the same problem, The cursor skipped all over the screen, randomly opening and closing windows without any input from me. I used an external mouse for a few days, then wiped the machine and sent it back to Lenovo. They repaired it (it was under warranty) and sent it back to me, but I lost two weeks use of the machine, not counting the time I spent wiping all of the data from my machine and then adding it back again.Then I found a problem that has never been resolved. I do a lot of public speaking and I learned (the hard way) that the HDMI to VGA connector does not work with high definition projectors. It works fine as long as you're connecting to a typical projector, but if the conference room happens to have a new machine the PowerPoint flickers on and off. Changing settings does nothing. There are a dozen or more people on the Lenovo user forum who have the same problem. Lenovo won't even acknowledge that it is a problem.I was trying to live with this issue when my computer finally went dead on Friday last week. I had no idea what was going on, but soon realized that my battery wasn't recharging. I called Lenovo support and they first informed me that my warranty had expired three weeks ago. Then they told me that they'd repair the problem if I send it back to them.I immediately went online, did a few hours of research, and ordered a Samsung ATIV Book 9.I've owned laptop computers for more than 20 years. I've had a ThinkPad (when they were made by IBM) two Dell's and two Sony Vaio's. They all had their flaws, but never have I had a single hardware failure or problem within the first three years of ownership.

Once again, not a very tech savvy type of guy, but my learning curve was pretty short and I found using the operating system to be pretty fun and simple. I like the live tiles and the ability to switch to a \"normal\" desktop mode that I've grown use to on older operating systems.WEIGHT & SPEED: From boot-up to getting online to pulling up previously worked on documents, I'm pleasantly surprised with how fast I can get right back in to the swing of things after hitting the power button. I travel extensively overseas and toting this around is truly non-fatiguing what-so-ever. 13.3 inch is a perfect size in my opinion for a travel laptop. my hands don't feel all scrunched together as I type, it's comfortable in my hand when I use it in a tablet mode and it's great to watch movies on:-)DISLAY & SOUND: the display is brilliant and movies, photos and charts really seem to come to life on its screen. The sound is certainly adequate and the ability to connect it either by the headphone jack or by Bluetooth really adds to its limitless configurations for listening to anything from youtube videos, to music to watching your favorite movies.TOUCHSCREEN: The screen has been VERY responsive to my touch and sometimes it reminds me of a very large smartphone in the way I can swipe or pinch or drag and drop and just completely interact with whatever task I have up on screen.  I guess it just goes to show that an \"old Dog\" truly can learn some new tricks:-)BATTERY LIFE: I can get approximately 5 hours of life from it, and that's with medium usage (I.E. watching a movie, playing a game or two, surfing the internet and working on Microsoft office based programs). It would be nice if I could get closer to 6-7 or even 8 hours out of it, but, I suppose 5 hours is a happy median.PORTS: It only has two USB ports; a 2.0 port and 3.0 port. This seems to be a bit minimal. I think three would have been MUCH better, but for me it was not a showstopper. Because of how thin it is there is no onboard DVD drive, once again, not a showstopper and it does have an HDMI port and media card port.Well, that's about it.

This was easily fixed by changing the settings.(2) The most comfortable typing experience I've had on a computer this small.(3) It weighs nothing and is so thin that its profile is invisible.I'm concerned about crunching it, but I've never had a computer this portable.(4) I've heard complaints about the wireless, but haven't encountered any problems connecting to my modest home network with Windows.(5) The trackpad is not that bad and supports fancy gestures like pinch-to-zoom and two-finger scroll.(6) I very much enjoy using it as a large tablet.Overall, this is a very nice product that has grown on me as I've used it.My advice to the user is: (1) Change the default font size!

Thinking I liked the versatility of this computer I went ahead and purchased the fully tricked out version for a little under $1500, quite a cost for an ultrabook computer but about $400 less than the Carbon X1. And in general I've been happy with the computer with the exception of two significant issues with the touchpad and the display that gave my three star review.The first and the major issue is the touchpad which has been a problem since I unpacked the box that the computer was shipped with. Occasionally the touchpad works perfectly for about 10-20 minutes. But then it starts to act up for me in two ways. First either the touchpad fails to respond to any movement or it responds very sluggishly to motion making it very difficult to use. The second issue is that clicking the left side of the touchpad often brings up the right click menus. When this occurs the left click does not work until you tap the screen to get rid of the right click menus. To try to fix this, I downloaded the driver again from the Lenovo site (this has been done 3 times), I've tried to first download the Synaptics driver and then replace it with the Lenovo driver and finally erased the software and did a full wipe and new installation with Windows 8 professional to get rid of the bloatware that comes with Windows 8. I downloaded the Lenovo driver again for the touchpad and that still did not help. The only way this works is to buy a Bluetooth mouse and use that instead of the Touchpad. I think the problem with this stems from the issue with turning the touchpad off when the computer is flipped to the tablet mode, which is does automatically to prevent you from accessing the keyboard when the computer is it tablet mode. Unfortunately, it seems to do this even when the computer is in notebook mode.The second problem I had was the virtual keyboard going away after about 1 second when the computer was in tablet mode. I fixed this by downloading a new graphics driver for the computer as that was the problem. Once those issues were fixed I found the computer to be a wonderfully good piece of machinery. But those were enough issues for me to rate this down to 3 stars and wish that I had purchased the Thinkpad Carbon X1.", "Date": "June 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Qulity!
