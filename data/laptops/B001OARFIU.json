{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good basic laptop", "Author": "Mike K \"technoguy\"", "ReviewID": "R1L0OYX70NKXJO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have to say that I like this little laptop.  I got mine for $369 at Office Depot.  At a \"netbook\" price I have a real laptop.  That means I have a 14\" screen (not 7-10\"), a full size keyboard (not a tiny one) and a CD/DVD burner (not available on netbooks).  In addition, it came with Vista Basic which is less of a resource hog than Vista Premium and a number of useful programs like Microsoft Works, NTI burning and backup software and Google Desktop.  My computer came with 2 GB RAM.I find the performance to be more than adequate for routine tasks and much speedier than netbooks that I have used.  With a real sized keyboard I feel that this computer could handle real tasks like typing a 10-20 page paper.  There is more than enough power to do those things that the typical user would want, like some simple photo editing.Obviously this is a bargain laptop so you can't expect the same features that you would get in a $1000 computer.  You won't find a webcam or even a SD card reader but you can certainly add those via USB if needed.  Speaking of USB, you only get 2 ports as opposed to the usual 3 and don't expect anything fancy like an HDMI or external SATA port.Will this computer:Run MS Office?  YesRun a simple photo editor?  YesRun Adobe Photoshop?  Probably not too wellRun Print Shop?  YesRun Adobe Illustrator?  Probably not too wellEdit a short You Tube video using MS Moviemaker?  YesEdit a long HD movie using Adobe Premier?  Probably notPlay simple 2D games?  YesPlay complex, high action 3D games?  Probably notUse a web cam for Skype?  Yes, but you will need to supply your own USB cameraRead flash cards?  Yes, but you will have to buy a cheap USB card readerAll in all I think the folks at eMachine thought long and hard to create a useable machine at the lowest price point.  In my opinion they succeeded.  If you want a super powered gamer in a fashion color look elsewhere.  If you need a basic machine that is bigger but also more user friendly than a netbook check out the eMachine.", "Date": "February 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "DOES EVERYTHING THE EXPENSIVE LAPTOPS DO AND COSTS HUNDREDS LESS!!!", "Author": "John Boland \"John  Boland\"", "ReviewID": "R37RF7X49HC22E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this laptop for a coumple of months.

I understand it is 3 years old now but I can't afford another one at the moment. Firstly the left hinge is broken, thinking I was alone I went on Ebay to see if I could get a replacement but found 2 laptops with the same problem. After googling the problem I couldn't believe how many people had this problem.I am now afraid to close my laptop and when you pick it up the screen falls flat, I've not mistreated it the hinge just cracked.  Also the laptop gets HOT and I mean really HOT!!I wouldn't buy it again as I now know of the emachines hinge problem. I would not recommend it either.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Broken hinges are common with E-Machines", "Author": "William Thorne", "ReviewID": "R2DU717XZBX29P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I too bought one of these. I have had it for about a year and my wife mainly uses it. I liked the price and the features and it does work well. BUT, now the outer case is cracking where the hinges are located. It has had careful use and this has cracked just from opening and closing. When I did a search on the internet, I was shocked at how many people have this problem that E-Machines washes their hands of. It is clearly a design problem, but this low class manufacturer has run not walked from any responsibility.", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Cheap Laptop", "Author": "Shishio", "ReviewID": "R12VJ7TSI0PIR3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop in 09/2009 from Best buy for about $300.I upgraded the memory to 2Gb for an extra $20.It has been a great computer for the last year.

I have traveled with it cross country 5 times now, 2 by air and 3 by car, and its held up. I am currently in art school, and run the Full CS6 Suite on it. With Windows 7 it runs really well for as little ram as it has. In fact I ran side by side tests with a 2 month old Mac Airbook and they had the same start up times for photoshop, illustrator and indesign. Works perfect with my Wacom Bamboo Tablet.Great for people on the fo and on a budget", "Date": "January 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop for the Money!", "Author": "Ben", "ReviewID": "R3GFOSNLMLPPSL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this computer I have to honestly say that I love the hell out of this thing ! It was a great deal, perfect size (smaller than your normal notebooks) and has everything you need on it. It is fast, clear, nice size screen, great resolution, battery life is about five hours. Has a fast enough processor for web surfing and MS Office. Good alternative to a netbook that has a micro-sized screen. I am very, very pleased with this computer !!!", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bad laptop  headphone jack broken one key on the laptop broken to fix these repairs would cost 400.00 dont buy this laptop !!", "Author": "George", "ReviewID": "R3PWADTC4ZD8EH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "pros fast inexpensivecons parts easily break thick low battery time no windows 7i bought this laptop in june 2009 then in august 2009 the headphone jack broke off then in september 2010 the shift key came off and wouldent go back on these parts would be 400.00 to reapir so i got a new laptop dont buy this laptop get a toshiba their alot better then this junk even with the inexpennsive price to purchace this it will break a lot faster then another laptop dont buy this thanks.", "Date": "February 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Doing OK...now....", "Author": "Roger", "ReviewID": "R3VVJ7SX0OJMW8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this laptop or one close to it (mine has 2G memory) for 1.5 yrs now.  This was my first laptop and my first experience with Vista...got a bit frustrated with all the security measures in Vista and almost corrupted the OS trying to get my stuff setup...would recommend shutting most of the Windows security stuff off before installing your own progs.During the first few boots...it tended to overheat...to the point of having a strong burnt electronics smell...after which I downloaded a prog to monitor the processor and drive temps...and its been OK since.Managed to corrupt the OS finally when using a prog that monitored changes for backup purposes, but which did not uninstall correctly.  Surprisingly...the OEM recommended backup disks I made reinstalled the OS as it was originally and I got it back up again using my manual data backups.Actually this laptop has done fine....EXCEPT for the overheating issue....which has not reoccurred...and the intrusive Vista security crapola...and I would STRONGLY recommend making the backup disks for both the OS and the drivers as soon as you have it up and running.  Battery only lasted 1 year though.", "Date": "February 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "a great $299.00 laptop", "Author": "Tankery \"Tankery\"", "ReviewID": "R1YB0896RPJSRH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought two of these D620 laptops when they went on sale briefly at Best Buy for 299.00 a piece.  I bought two 19.00 1 gig memory modules to upgrade them to 2 gig.  The back panel is a little tricky to remove, so be careful.  Otherwise, the design is solid and this D620 is a much better acquisition than a Netbook, in my opinion, as the 4 pound 14 inch monitor is light but not at all bulky.They are well worth the three hundred dollars with DVD read-writable/Vista Home Basic, etc.  They are made of solid plastic and unless you drop them they should be fine.As for selling one for 499.00?  Well, there are probably fifty better laptops in between 299 and 499 you could buy.a D620 only has2 USB ports and no webcam and with only 1 gig, they are a deal at 299.00, not a deal at much more than that.jhA Bottle of RainNowhere Near the Sea of Cortez", "Date": "December 29, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001OARFIU"}}
