Never got response from Asus support...", "Author": "Turbohawk \"If you're not living on the edge, ...", "ReviewID": "R1R0Y5ISMQBRCJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First, I have to give credit to the awesome Amazon customer service rep on how the return for this defective item was handled. I've always dreaded buying computers from online retailers but I don't fear anything with Amazon in this regard anymore.I really LOVED the performance and IDEA of this machine. With the Optimus dual video card setup, the balance of battery life/performance from a higher end dedicated video seems to be achievable. Unfortunately my unit had issues, first with the system not recognizing the Nvidia card, then with the wireless network refusing to power up, that were never acknowledged by Asus tech support even after several email complaints (via their online reporting system) and attempting calling their phone number (nothing has been heard even to the date of this writing).I believe that Asus builds quality components, at least in my experience, but their support with other items I've owned (motherboards) leaves a LOT to be desired. I once returned a defective motherboard that was returned to me without any explanation or physical clue that anything was done. It did seem to work, so I guess I shouldn't complain?  Would have been nice to know what went wrong, that's all.For some reason the Asus notebooks UNDER the $1400 pricepoint (as of this review) only carry a 1 year warranty. Granted, they also include an accidental damage coverage (one time use) which is nice.I probably just got a defective unit but there weren't any available to exchange.This model does not have bluetooth, BluRay, and the DVD burning was woefully slow (8X max). It's lightweight (a feather compared to my old HP) but doesn't feel like very tough either.  Unfortunately I didn't have this unit running long enough to fully explore it's capabilities. Your mileage may vary. I will consider another Asus (especially after learning that Sony uses their motherboards in many, if not all, of their laptops) but I'll do a lot more research before I pull the trigger on the next one.", "Date": "March 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "The most perfect laptop currently available - but not 100% perfect", "Author": "M. Falcon \"Falcon4\"", "ReviewID": "RK0RJTH2A6W0H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So, I'd done a lot of research and saving-up before buying this laptop, the first laptop I'd ever bought at retail. From the experience of countless secondhand budget laptops, I'd come to understand just what makes a perfect laptop, and while this laptop isn't 100% perfect, it's as close to perfection-to-price as you can get. For double or even triple the price, you can get a comparable laptop with some of the quirks resolved (like in an overpriced, less durable Sony laptop), but for most people, this is \"IT\".Let's talk about its strengths. 500gb 7200rpm hard drive, fast enough to compete with - and even beat - some desktop hard drives in my own testing. Since the hard drive basically directly determines a computer's real-world performance, this thing really, really flies. And at 500gb, it's big enough to store anything and never have to think about it. It's still a good idea to think about it, but still. The cover is actually very much black, not \"dark brown\", which is a huge lifesaver to me... I would hate to carry around a brown laptop that literally \"looks like crap\". It's got two clear indicators on the sides telling you when the nVidia graphics chip is turned on, or the i5-integrated Intel IGP is in use. The Intel IGP is absolutely eons ahead of its class, able to rip through simple 3D games and HD video as if it was on a dedicated chip. But for those times when you really DO need a dedicated chip, the nVidia GT 325M kicks in and totally roars through anything you throw at it. Haven't yet been able to get it to stutter. CUDA support means when developers finally get off their lazy arse and embrace the technology, you can run your video encoding and various other computations on there as well. There's currently a CUDA h264 encoder available, but due to a lack of advanced settings (such as motion estimation mode & range), the quality is really poor. SuperSpeed USB 3.0 is an amazing new technology (I bought a SATA-to-USB3 adapter for this as well) that really delivers \"holy crap\" speeds - AND power - to an external interface. A Flash media holder in the ExpressCard slot cover is a nice touch as well. Battery life is pretty average for a laptop, around 2... 2.5 hours with average use. More when just watching a movie, less when playing a game or otherwise engaging the power-hungry nVidia chip (all the more reason to love this laptop - it can actually turn its discrete graphics chip *completely off* and runs that way most of the time).Weaknesses? Well... it's got a few. For one, no Blu-Ray drive, though the hardware is more than capable of it. And no Bluetooth... even though the header on the board - AND preapplied double-stick tape! - are right under the front-left part of the palm rest. Those can both be resolved by installing a SATA Blu-Ray drive, and acquiring the appropriate model Bluetooth adapter. The others, not so much. First, and quite annoying for some, Optimus is \"automatic only\", with no way to manually change graphics adapters. You can add exceptions for \"use the nVidia chip for this application\", for example, but you can't actually engage the nVidia chip full time. I almost think it has something to do with Optimus itself, perhaps that it doesn't actually \"switch\" graphics controllers, but merely uses the nVidia chip to render certain applications and pass the rendered graphics to the Intel IGP to be displayed. That would explain why the screen never even flickers when the nVidia chip switches on or off. *shrug* Anyway, the sound also isn't that hot... not nearly as \"Amazing\" as the description implies - less tinny than most laptops, but still not as mind-blowingly \"big sound\" as some Toshiba laptops I've used. And the software, oh god the software. Comes with so much Asus bloat & crapware, I spent a good part of the first day owning it just cleaning it up. The Asus auto-updater is totally useless, never offers updates available on the Asus website (like a BIOS update, available right out of the box). And the hard drive is partitioned into 2 main parts - OS and Data - both for performance and for safe keeping, but Data is - as with all known OEMs - not configured to be used for anything by default. It takes some techgeekery to relocate your user profile (C:\\Users\\You, for example) to this data drive (D:\\You), but it's worth it. And the touchpad is absolutely god-awful, taking several days to get used to its quirks and oddities. Software is cheap Chinese \"Elan\" crap, far unlike the polished, refined Synaptics touchpads the world has grown up with. Picks up stray taps that weren't even touching (just hovering over the pad), and misses taps and gestures that are. Really wish Asus just stuck with what works, and stuck with a Synaptics touchpad.Overall this laptop is, quite simply, the most perfect performance for value you can get. Raw performance is mind-blowing - it's a laptop you can throw ANYTHING at and be able to run. Any PC game, any computing task, it can do it. It's a portable powerhouse. It's just a little rough around the edges, but at under $1,000, you'll never find a better deal. Period.", "Date": "July 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Buying ASUS only from now on!", "Author": "S.

So first things first, the product arrived in pristine condition which was a relief. Everything was included and well packaged. After putting it together and turning it on, the first message i got when i logged into windows was about creating a back up DVD of everything on the laptop including the windows. This was perfect since I have a habit of reinstalling windows every year and clearing my HD. So right off the bat it was reading my mind because I was going to do that anyway but now ASUS has created their own back up program that does it all. You just need 4 DVD's to burn the data. I don't use the laptop primarily as a gaming system but I do run SolidWorks and MATLAB and Rhinoceros on it as well as a couple of other programs that require high specs. And I am happy to say that it outperformed and not only runs each program without any glitches, it is perfectly capable of running them all at once.The only thing that gave me a worry about two days ago was the wireless card. The front I/O switch wasn't working and the hot key for enabling the card was also not working. This went on for a couple of days and when it started to get irritating I decided to actually try and fix it. After Disabling and Enabling the card from Device Manager, the card seems to be working again. There hasn't been any other issues with the laptop and I'm happy to say that it is definitely a good choice for the price. Not to mention that it comes with a one year accidental damage warranty from ASUS, that you just need to register your laptop for.", "Date": "April 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Buy", "Author": "Dermott", "ReviewID": "R1QG9L57CI1HNZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using this computer for a little more than a month now, and I love it.As a little background: I'm a computer science student graduating in a week. I've done a lot of work repairing laptops, so I know a nice computer when I see one.Here are the highlights> chicklet keyboard - despite the pictures of the computer up on Amazon, the computer ships with a standard US keyboard. There are no weird euro symbols, the shift keys are the right size, \"at\" and \"backslash\" are where you expect them to be. While that may not be a big deal for most people, as a programmer I expect my keys to be where I want them -- I was holding my breath in fear of a euro-board when this baby shipped. Thank God for US keyboards.> The nVidia GT 325M handles amazingly well. L4D2, Half-Life 2 all run with the settings cranked all the way up without any serious issues - around 30-40 FPS, up to 50.Optimus technology is AMAZING. The only way you can tell that the computer switched graphics cards is by the LED lights on the sides (the blue lights turn white when the nVidia card kicks in). The nVidia control panel gives you a lot of options for setup with individual programs - make use of it!> Battery life is decent, given the power of the computer. On power saver settings I can pull about 5 hours of note-taking for class.> Screen is PAINFULLY bright. Don't bother with a desk lamp - the webcam handles well in the dark, so just the light from the screen is more than sufficient.> Core i5 w/ 4GB of DDR3 RAM, 64-bit win7, 500GB 7200rpm hard drive. With a real graphics card. for $900. wow.There are some down sides to this product.> number pad keys are small> the nVidia card doesn't play nice with the computer on battery, and driver support is still a little immature. This hasn't caused me serious issues, but every now and then serious games will hang for 2-3 seconds. This happened to me twice playing through portal (about a 4 hour marathon) and more often in L4D2 - sometimes it happens every 2-3 hours, sometimes it happens every 10 minutes... I have to assume drivers, as I can't find any other probable cause. Still looking into this... Framerates on battery power, even on High Performance power settings are around 10-15... seems Optimus doesn't play nice with battery power yet.> ASUS ships their computers with TONS of crapware. And by tons, I mean \"do a clean install the moment you get your computer\". The driver disk is very handy - you can re-install all of your drivers, including some that aren't on the ASUS website by simply checking/unchecking boxes and hitting go. This is much easier than sitting around and uninstalling 20 useless programs that shipped with the computer. Seriously - I don't need 3 third-party applications doing power-management and wi-fi management... it's built into Windows.> This bugger is heavy. If you're after something portable, don't bother. If you want a moderately-carriable laptop that will play Left for Dead at your buddy's house... well... keep reading.> ASUS touchpads are their own animal... you'll have to spend time dorking with the settings before it works the way you want it to. There is NO dedicated scroll section of the pad - it's multi-touch scrolling only. You get used to it, but it takes awhile. Eventually you'll find yourself using multi-touch for right/middle clicking things... it even works. sometimes.Conclusion:This processor has a lot of get-up-and-go for a laptop - it's not an i7, but this computer won't cost you $2000 either. 4GB of DDR3 RAM, with support for up to 8. 1GB of dedicated video memory, and a real graphics card. Sound is reasonable for a laptop. It has two USB 2 ports (I believe it says that a 3rd is shared with the eSATA port, but that is NOT the case), a single USB 3 port, eSATA and HDMI. A few more USB ports would have been nice, but it's not bad. The webcam and built in mic work surprisingly well.For $900 this is an amazing computer, especially with the USB 3 and wireless-N support. I expect the nVidia issues will probably work themselves out with newer drivers in the near future, but in the meanwhile the chip is still very usable (as long as you aren't on battery...)", "Date": "May 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop", "Author": "S.

Based on previous reviews, I immediately updated all the drivers including BIOS updates and the computer worked beautifully.The (sorta) BadI almost returned it because my wireless would turn off every time I shut the lid which I found incredibly annoying.  After doing some research, I resolved to completely reinstall windows 7 premium and not install any of the ASUS special software.  That fixed everything.  The computer boots faster, the wireless doesn't shut itself off and the battery lasts longer.The card reader won't read my SD card from my canon.  I know that the card itself is fine because my husband's HP envy will read it.  The card reader will read other SD card's though, so it could just be because the SD card itself is about 5 years old.The screen can get a pretty bad glare- if anyone has a suggestion to fix this, I would really appreciate it!The GoodI was concerned about 2 main things before I bought this laptop- battery life and the weight.  The battery life is better than I expected- although keep in mind I only use battery life during long seminars and meetings, so I keep the screen dim and am pretty much just using a word processor to keep notes.  The weight was also a pleasant surprise.  Asus seems to somehow balance the weight in the machine as to not make it seem as heavy as it is.  Go to a store near you that sells computers and pick up a few Asus computers as well as comparable weighted machines made by other manufactures and you'll see what I mean.The computer handles very well.  I can have 27 word files open, 5 excel files open, 8 pdfs, itunes running in the background and have a sequence alignment program going with no slowing of speed.Gaming wise, it handled several MMORPG's and RPG's with no trouble, there is another review with better specs on here if that is what you are interested in.  The only issue I ran into was getting the graphics card to switch.  When I first loaded AoC, the lights stayed blue.  I had to right click on it and tell it to use the Nvidia card and after that it always remembered to use the Nvidia (although, this was also before I got rid of all the asus stuff).This is the coolest temperature-wise computer I have ever owned.  The keyboard and palm area stays pretty cool despite whatever processes I am running.The mousepad is AWESOME!!!!!  I came from a macbook so having a multitouch mouse pad with 2 finger scrolling was a must.  The mouse is every bit as responsive as my old computer and much more customizable.The chicklet keyboard is also really awesome.  The keys aren't too loud, they bounce under you fingers nicely and have great spacing if you are used to typing on a laptop.  I love that there is a number pad as well.

I am sad I had to return it because the other alternatives I found were significantly more expensive :/. At any rate If you are not worried about your video card performance this is a great deal and I would recommend it highly. And who knows, Nvidia might come out with the working driver any day now...", "Date": "July 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great laptop, lose the bloatware", "Author": "K.

Sure there are minor grips about where some keys are on the keyboard (arrow keys,  0 key on numpad) but you just learn where they are.  I've never used a laptop that I would consider replacing my desktop with, but I definitely would for this.  The drivers for the video card were a little premature when it shipped, but windows 7 found new ones and installed and its working much better now.The features really are packed in this.
