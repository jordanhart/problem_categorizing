I had to get use to windows 8 took me about a week to get comfortable with it. Having a touch screen is a must have for a laptop with windows 8. The screen is a bit bad i don't like the angle glare but not a huge problem. I have upgraded to windows 8.1 with no problems at all very smooth install very surprised i had no driver problems. The laptop is used between all in my home my wife and two young children ranging from video editing to small time gaming like minecraft and word documents the computer is very fast and handles everything with ease.", "Date": "February 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "This Computer is amazing", "Author": "Nicki-Patricia Lawler", "ReviewID": "R205XV5GX6EZZ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been using a Toshiba Satellite 105 computer for about 8 years until I bought this a week ago. Since windows XP was no longer going to receive updates, I decided to upgrade.  I researched online, compared lots of products and decided on an i5 processor because I do not do any video or picture editing, nor do I do gaming on my computer. I decided on 8 gigs of ram because I noticed the price difference between that and 4 or 6 gigs was not drastic and as it helps run processes better, why not. The screen size and resolution are excellent, it has a built in camera (it will be nice for skyping with my parents who live in a different state) and the an excellent feature that I did not know it came with was that it has a cooled palm rest area. The cooled palm rest would not have been a make or break deal for me with it, but it was a more than pleasant surprise. The touchscreen is responsive and easy to use like the one on my iPad, this feature was also not a make or break feature but compared to other models that did not have it, it was essentially free at this price. Also, it came with a Terabyte hard drive (1000 gigabytes), which to be honest is probably more space than I'll ever need but I do take and store a lot of family pictures.The only con that I have with the computer and I can not even fault the computer for this is the operating system. It does come with windows 8.1, which honestly is not the greatest operating system ever. It takes a while to get use to and to figure out how to edit the \"app screen.\" Once I figured that out, got apps I actually wanted and got rid of the ones I did not it made that screen a lot more pleasant, though I rarely use it. As for the \"classic view\" desktop that we are all use to with windows, that just requires creating some shortcuts on either the desktop itself or the tool bar at the bottom. I essentially spent a day setting windows up to where it was easier to use for me and every now and then I have to set something else up that I had forgotten about. I would not say windows 8.1 is the absolute worst operating system, but it's not the best. I feel like once you set up shortcuts on your desktop or tool bar, the lack of a start menu is negated.Again, I can not recommend this product enough for someone who is microsoft office work oriented and not in to heavy picture or video editing. For the price, with tax and $5.99 next day shipping, the processor, ram, touchscreen and hard drive are a steal and you will be hard pressed to find another computer with this many features for a price even close to this one.", "Date": "April 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Really?", "Author": "Shaina Corbin", "ReviewID": "R2QG69G8NE9OCF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I loved this computer when i first got it. It looked great worked great and then a few months of use the problems became apparent. I very gently use my electronics because I want them to last. After 5 years with an Asus laptop I decided a new computer would be great. This computer boasted some good specs perfect for me. Fast foward to now. Ive had the screen dim out on me several times to where it practically goes dark and you can very faintly see whats on the screen if you look closely enough. this can only be reconciled by turning it off and back on. A normal tap of the space bar or the touchscreen or the mouse should cause it to click back  on. Then the shotty keyboard began to loose buttons. Most computers are pretty solidly made but with very little pressure applied to the keyboard or the back of the screen reveals how much empty space is between it and how cheaply the materials feel that make up the product. Bottom line is looks can be deceiving. I wont purchase another lenovo computer as a quick google search will reveal the problems i listed across several models. steer clear", "Date": "June 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop, had Defect, great service from Amazon", "Author": "Reed", "ReviewID": "R2RFKSJAFA71DA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this laptop a week ago here on Amazon. In many ways it exceeded my expectations. It came with Windows 8.1 (so I didn't have to do the update) which was nice. I like the keyboard and the feel of it. The touchscreen works well and it's a cool feature. Though Windows 8 takes getting used to, it's kinda nice having the apps and various new capabilities. All in all great laptop.Following the initial excitement of the new laptop, I soon discovered that the optical/DVD drive would not open. Pressing the exterior drive button resulted in a blinking light and an ever-closed drive. By going to 'Computer' and selecting 'Eject' on the DVD drive there, I got a little more noise from the drive but it still didn't open.I called Lenovo technical support and received help from a nice lady who after our 30 minute discussion/service concluded it must be a hardware issue. My 2 options are to (1) return the laptop to Amazon, or (2) ship the laptop to the Lenovo repair depot in TX for repairs. She informed me that the typical turn-around rate for repairs is 7 business days. Lenovo would cover all of the expenses, other than the initial shipping to get it out to the depot.I'm leaning toward option 1 since that should save me time and money. Amazon covers up to $12 of return shipping, and I won't have to wait 7 business days for the repair. Lenovo's repair service option just seems like way too much of a hassle.***EDIT***I changed my rating from 3 stars to 4 stars because I had initially taken 2 stars off for poor service (Lenovo's service and options were sub-par). However, Amazon's service was amazing. The only reason I did not rate this at 5 stars was because of Lenovo's service.I decided to do a replacement return with Amazon. Amazon completely covered all shipping & return costs. (The UPS drop-off  option prints a free shipping label). I received my new laptop within 2 days (before they had even received the defected laptop). The replacement laptop is in perfect condition with no defects. On top of that, I noticed a price-change from the original $649 to a lower $589 after I had completed my replacement return. I contacted Amazon and they refunded me $60 for the price change, though there is no policy I could find requiring them to do that. (It was more than a week after my original purchase, but it was within 7 days of the replacement return purchase).IN SUMMARY: 5 star laptop, 5 star service from Amazon, 3 star service from Lenovo. 4 Stars. If you're going to buy a laptop buy it from Amazon!", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Office Depot Sale with Groupon - less than $400.00!", "Author": "Capt. Pickles", "ReviewID": "R3BHHX54Q4OWZ9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this from Office Depot two months ago for $389.00.  Was on sale for $449.00. THey shipped for in store pick up in two days.I had a Groupon for $60. So I was able to buy 2 year service warrenty that includes battery and accidental breakage.Out the door for $502.00!Unit was Windows 8 with 4th gen i-3 and 6GB ram. Plenty for home use and even works well on my measly 1.5MB DSL compared to my old computer - 1997 Dell Pentium 3 with 512MB ram running Linux.Touch screen is a big plus and is very clear and well responsive like most android phones.  Not membrane where you need to use a nail to get it to work. This screen is capacitive so light touches work fine.Speed is great compared to P3. 500MB HD is plenty although I use a 1TB external for storage incase i need to return it for warrenty work. I wont lose my stuff.  Comes preloaded with minimal bloatwear but it does include McAfee Live Safe.  After the 30 days trial Lenovo customers can buy the first year for $19.99 right on the laptop form the softwear. You do not have to fish through McAfee's web site.  All in all this is a great general purpose computer. i run older games in 32 but mode that work fine. THis unit has all the RF connections including BlueTooth so you dont need to get anything else.  Connects fine to Windows Nokia Lumina and works better than iTunes.BTW, the 90's called.  They wanted my old computer back but when they saw the postage, they said to just keep it.It is now a dedicated media server on my Wifi.Look for the sales  from Office Depot. I was surprised how easy and thourogh they are when it comes to the few high end notebooks they carry.  They beat out BJ's and Costco on brand and features withthe price even without the groupon even with purchasing the 2 year warrenty.  Lenovo is a first pick for brand vs value, then Asus.", "Date": "April 2, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00HO9P046"}}
