{"Reviews": [{"Title": "You Get What You Pay For....", "Author": "Bubba_Gump", "ReviewID": "R34VW6SXHOGM4K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been an avid user of desktop and laptop computers for 20, plus years... also done most of my repair and \"mod\" work. I have seen, read and heard just about ALL the sales hype online and off line at \"retail stores.\"I posed two questions about this system to which another reviewer replied. I also replied to their answers with more \"specific\" questions, as well as, thanking the individual for the information.Briefly, the website posted my reply with the second set of questions for more clarity. I also asked the individual if they are a Dell Alienware employee. I suppose that is why my reply (comments) to the person's answers to my questions was removed. I do not see it posted here.The reason I give this system a \"5-Star\" rating is because of the \"added\" work the company (HIDevolution) puts into building a laptop (Alienware) that was once \"Made in USA\" a better product by \"today's standards,\" before the company was acquired by Dell.There is, as I recall, approximately $600.00 difference between the price of this laptop v. the top of the line $5,700.00 Dell Alienware version which requires that you use an \"external\" drive in lieu of an \"internal\" optical drive that comes with the HIDevolution version. The HIDevolution Alienware version gives you MORE storage capacity and allows the consumer to have a slot for an \"internal\" optical drive (DVD, etc). Proper thermal grease for enhanced heat dissipation is a must, especially, for such a confined environment in a high performance laptop that is truly a \"mobile\" desktop replacement. HIDevolution focused on \"detail\" by being \"proactive\" to take care of that issue.Forget about the weight and size. This is a \"high performance\" mobile desktop replacement that can be used for any application you use (i.e. gaming, CAD, Photo/Video Editing...... etc, etc).No..... I am not an \"employee\" with HIDevolution. I do not receive a \"fee\" to monitor websites and post comments. I am, however, a consumer who is ready to replace an aging Vista Ultimate 64 BIT OS running on a Toshiba \"Made in Japan\" laptop with something that should last (on the hardware side) for MANY years, aside from the inevitable replacement of worn components. Judging by the component list for this laptop failure of worn components should be minimal.I hope Amazon will keep this post intact.", "Date": "May 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "wonderful alienware", "Author": "Sweta Sonulkar", "ReviewID": "R36CFQLBRQ0K8H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The lighting features are excellent and can change to users choice and the laptop has huge capacity of hard drive,memory, and excellent gaming features and the look is awesome.The screen is big and wide.The volume is great features for high sound movie and games and i love the color too", "Date": "May 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "The king of all laptops.", "Author": "Shawn Fenn", "ReviewID": "R2WW4D5HYP3HQ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is one of the best laptops in the market despite being so overwhelmingly overpriced and bulky.
