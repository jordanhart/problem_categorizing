It's very light weight which is a big plus for us since we carry it around a lot. I hate the fact that it came with Windows 8, but for the price you can't find another comparable laptop that doesn't.I don't like how the trackpad works.

Olawski", "ReviewID": "R10B2APY9G1KGZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Samsung Laptop Model: NP270E5E-K02USPurchase: 10/30/2013 (TigerDirect via Amazon)Delivered: 11/06/2013This laptop worked the first two weeks then after performing a Windows 8 update it stopped working.  The laptop would attempt to boot, show the Samsung splash screen, display a 2-second error message, re-boot and then cycle through the same process over and over again.I contacted Samsung and with the assistance of their technical support person attempted to recover from the error.  After a while he determined that a full restore of the hard drive was warranted and that he would ship me a recovery disk.  I asked him why a recovery disk was not included with the laptop and he said it was because the recovery information is on the hard drive.  You see the hard drive has various partitions including one for the OS (Windows 8) and one for recovery information.  The problem is that if the partitions are compromised, recovery may not be feasible; such is the case with my laptop.I waited for over two weeks for the recovery disk, but it never arrived.  I contacted Samsung again (now a month after receiving the laptop) and spoke with two different customer support people.  I was told is that the recovery disk was not available, that it\u2019s on back order and they don\u2019t know when it will be available again.  I asked what other support options were available since I have a laptop that cannot be utilized.  They offered no further assistance and told me that there is nothing further they can do.Apparently, if you purchase a Samsung product and something goes wrong, you\u2019re on your own.I\u2019ve tried installing Windows 7, but the laptop does not recognize the install disk and none of the F keys respond.I contacted Amazon to see if I could return the laptop, but since it was purchased through TigerDirect and fulfilled by Amazon, it\u2019s TigerDirect\u2019s return policy that applies.  Amazon did contact Tiger Direct on my behalf, but I have not heard back from them to date.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent", "Author": "Francisco Barros", "ReviewID": "R1DW42XI2QWDML", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very faster, big screen, a numeric pad, a single port for audio/mic (like cellphone hand free), dvd recorder, great sound, its ok ! =)", "Date": "November 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice laptop but hate Windows 8", "Author": "Ana", "ReviewID": "R2XFA2NKBTXLZY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "By the time being the laptop is great.
