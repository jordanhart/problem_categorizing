{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great computer, given the price is right", "Author": "J. Shariat", "ReviewID": "R3NHWY80NQPNE9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this computer from another site when they had a promotion on it.  I looked at the specs and the price, and saw that it was a steal, and I abandoned my prejudice against HP for their past products and bought it.  I am very happy that I did.  I won't say the exact price that I got the computer for, but I will say that this computer is in the $600 and under category.This computer is a good mixture of good technology.  The processor in this computer is a very good processor for a number of reasons.  The L2 cache is 2mb as opposed to 1mb in most Turion IIs; the energy consumption is 25w, which is very low for a laptop processor of this magnitude.  The M880 chipset and ATI Radeon 4250 provide a decent graphics setup; obviously, this computer isn't for modern gaming due to the lack of a dedicated video card...  However, this video setup is much better than you will get with any Intel onboard graphics and will work just fine for most anything short of intensive 3D gaming/ 3D rendering...  The 14\" screen on this computer is a good one, with great viewing angles.  The speakers are good for laptop speakers, but really, there aren't any spectacular internal laptop speakers and so if you want great sound quality and volume, invest in a decent pair of laptop speakers.Aesthetically, this computer is certainly pleasing.  The silver-ish patterned case of the computer is really unique and I really enjoy it.  14\" is the perfect size for me, as it cradles perfectly in my lap and is much, much more portable than 15.6\" or so laptops than I have owned in the past.The keyboard is not bad at all...  No Num Pad, but the buttons and function button planning are very well done.  For a 14\" laptop, I'm not sure if you can ask for a smarter/ better keyboard than this...As for the cons, there is one that may just be something I am misunderstanding, but it really seems like the USB port that is on the right side (for the mouse) is not USB 2.0...  For some reason, it doesn't get nearly the transfer rate as the other USB ports.  I recommend getting a high speed hub with this computer so that you can easily add the additional USB ports that you will surely need.  The other con is also fair in magnitude...  HP has a lot of programs that it installs to keep your computer running well with HP updates on the drivers on your computer and such.  Some of these programs are helpful and some are bloatware.  It is much harder to sort out which is which with HP laptops than other brands, since they get so much more involved in the upkeep of your computer.  I have it set up just fine on my computer now, and practically any laptop that you get nowadays is going to have some kind of bloatware on it, so the problem is easily handled with a bit of time, just like with most laptops.  Extra care is needed to make sure that you do not remove programs that HP has created to help your computer, such as keep the hardware drivers up to date, etc...All in all, this computer is great...  Just what I was looking for!  This laptop is perfect for just about anyone that doesn't do intense 3D graphic stuff.  I would even go so far as to say that anything better than this is overkill if you are not going to be doing that type of stuff.  This is a great desktop replacement computer that is very versatile in its uses and very good on the battery given the power of the computer.  I was hesitant to buy HP before this computer, but I am certainly not anymore.Five stars from me!", "Date": "August 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excelent purchase!", "Author": "Christian Boj\u00f3rquez (Lima Per\u00fa)", "ReviewID": "R14S4SJADKEH7V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop for my wife. She uses it mainly for MSN Messenger, Facebook games, hotmail and photo viewing. I was looking for a decent laptop that costed me no more than $700. I also read before that the AMD based computeres performed well with games/graphics and were cheaper than the Intel ones. The design and size was important as well. Its white case makes this laptop look finer than the ordinary black laptop. There is nothing to regret about it. Even Windows 7 turned to be very friendly (first time we ever use it). Net is: my wife is very happy with her new laptop. The only thing this laptop lacks is the Bluetooth connectivity, but it's ok 'cause I can buy a USB bluetooth connector. Also, the wireless network radio is better than my Lenovo T400's. The HP does not get disconnected in low signal areas but mine does.I recommend this laptop if you're looking for a nice computer for a basic user with eventual gaming.", "Date": "October 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "VERY FAST COMPUTER--WONDERFUL BATTERY LIFE--READON...", "Author": "Daisy S \"Daisy S\"", "ReviewID": "R206JS1YSQ8ZWG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The reason that I bought this was I have found HP Computers to run quietly and the Laptops stay COOL! I am very picky about laptops and I give this one ALL 5's in all of these areas below:1) BATTERY LIFE - This one is rated at 4.5 hours (no computer will achieve the battery life the manufacturer states). However, when I use a computer I have WiFi ON all the time and I am always on the internet. So I tested out this unit and with WiFi on ALL the time with 4 tabs opened, I had a battery life of 3.5 hours! I was so pleased. I believe if I turned my screen down to 25% and just typed in Word, kept the WiFi off, I would have had 4.0 to 4.25 hours! So I give it 5 stars. (My Acer Aspire (old) netbook only gets 4.5 to 5.0 hours, and my old 15.6 Acer (with Vista) only got 1 - 1.5 hours of battery life.2) COOLNESS: I have owned several laptops in the past and they ran so hot that I could have fried an egg on them. This one is 95% cool and now with my Thermapak Cooler, it is 100% COOL even with I run it for 12 hours at one time!3) QUIET - Cannot hear the HARD DRIVE and the fan is so quiet.4) Hard Drive does not spin much.5) Fast, fast and fast computer: Booting is in just a couple of seconds. Opening programs is very fast.6) Love the keyboard, so easy to type on this!7) Lightweight and small but not too small. Fits easily into my laptop backpack!8) The 14\" is best for me and better than a net-book for travel because the screen is so much larger and this laptop has a DVD/CD read/write drive. I watched a movie on it and it was plenty large enough for me with beautiful picture and colors!I love HP and have used Dell and Acer, however, I prefer HP to the other brands!In summary: In my opinion, this is the best laptop for the money out there!", "Date": "May 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop", "Author": "PV2 Bunting", "ReviewID": "R2HUONOHO36V9Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop about two months ago and it has been amazing.

My first upgrade was to replace the original 350GB drive with a 500GB and the second upgrade was to upgrade from the original W7HomePrem-64bit with W7Ult-64bit. This OS upgrade allowed me to pick and choose what \"bloatware\" to reinstall. My latest upgrade was replacing the original Elpidia 4GB DDR3 memory kit with Corsair 8 GB DDR3 Laptop Memory Kit CMSO8GX3M2A1333C9. Once installed, I ran the built-in HP diags, including a successful 3-hour memory testing cycle. The HP diags displays the newly installed Corsairs as having PN# CMSO4GX3M1A1333C9. I also ran Windows 7 Performance Rating Tools. Before the upgrade the RAM Rating was 5.9 and after the upgrade the same rating registered 7.1. The Gaming Graphics \"Total available graphics memory\" numbers went from 1696 MB to 3067 MB. In practical terms, I don't know what all these numbers imply. The online transaction with Amazon was flawless, as usual. And my experience with this laptop and upgrades were excellent. With all these techie stuff running on a tiny form factor and a tiny fan, heat and fan noise are going to be an issue. This is going to be true of any OEM brands. Three things I did to address these: Disable the \"Fan-On\" all the time feature in the config-setup, use an external laptop \"cooler\" and remove the 6-cell battery when I don't need mobility.Corsair 8 GB DDR3 Laptop Memory Kit CMSO8GX3M2A1333C9 USB Powered and Most Efficient Metal Cooler Pad with 3 Built-in Fans for Laptop ComputerHitachi Travelstar 2.5 Inch 500 GB 7200 RPM SATA II 16 MB Cache Internal Hard Drive 0S02858Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate Upgrade HP G42-240US 14.Inch Laptop", "Date": "April 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worst laptop I've ever owned.", "Author": "A. Hickman", "ReviewID": "R1EZRNQGXBDWB6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "27 August 2011 Update:I've had the computer for a year year now and it just started overheating and shutting down randomly.  The terrible part is my warranty is expired by like 2 weeks.  I will never by an HP again.Original Review:This is by far the worst laptop I've ever owned.  Right out of the box the box the multi touch mouse features didn't work nor have worked since.  At two months of owning the laptop, it locked up and I couldn't fully start Windows.  The silver lining to this was that there was a feature that allowed you to backup the computer even if you couldn't fully start the computer.  This did save it, and almost temped me to up the rating review on this laptop.  So I was able to restore my laptop, and restore all my documents, but still frustrated that I had to do it.  So now 3 months into owning the computer my lcd screen is malfunctioning.  Half the screen is dark and grainy.  I've talked to customer service, who to their credit, was very helpful, and I'm sending in my laptop.Now I suppose I could be having these problems with any laptop but there are other features I just can't stand with the laptop.  Probably my biggest complaint is the mousepad.  I hate the way it feels, the pointer is stiff, the mousepad is slow and at times unresponsive.  A number of times I've accidently shut the whole mousepad off, because I've accidently kept my hand/finger over the little whole on the mouse pad.Now to the computer's credit there are a few things that have been good.  The keyboard is comfortable, the laptop itself is pretty light, and it's nice having an hdmi port on the computer.  Also as mentioned earlier, it was great to still be able to backup the computer after it crashed.  If I hadn't had the problems with my mouse, screen, and computer crashing, then I probably would give the computer 3 stars.On a side note, my wife loves it, doesn't mind the mouse, thinks the laptop is cute, and loves the built in camera.", "Date": "November 7, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "AMD Turion II Dual-Core Mobile Processor P520 (2.3GHz, 2MB L2 Cache); 4GB DDR3 System Memory (2 DIMM)\n14.0 inch diagonal High-Definition HP BrightView LED Display (1366 x 768)\nTextured HP Imprint finish with the prism design in white; HP Webcam with integrated microphone\nIntegrated 10/100BASE-T Ethernet LAN (RJ-45 connector); Wireless LAN 802.11b/g/n WLAN\n3 Universal Serial Bus (USB) 2.0; 1 HDMI; 1 VGA (15-pin); 1 RJ -45 (LAN); 1 Headphone-out; 1 Microphone-in", "Name": "HP G42-240US 14.Inch Laptop", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41wYyE-1K%2BL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003KN3K42"}}
