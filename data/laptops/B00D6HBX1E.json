{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Desktop Replacement.", "Author": "Ayan111", "ReviewID": "R3F37EGJWI9ZDV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a really great machine. Ram is expandable upto 32 gb, 1 msata slot, 2 hard drive slots. Runs everything i can throw at it without any issues. The laptop is also incredibly easy to work on. Opening two screws on the base gives you easy access to the ram slots, hard drive, cpu, gpu, etc. I was able to add in an additional 8Gb Ram and a 128 Gb SSD in minutes. Also the HDMI port on it is an IN/OUT port, that allows you to attach an external hdmi source like an Xbox or Ps3 and view it on the internal laptop display (pretty cool feature).", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't buy Dell?", "Author": "Timothy Boyle", "ReviewID": "R2F4E9OFFTZYCM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Nothing to do with seller I'm sure.Lap top LCD doesn't work.Dell sends a repair guy. Repair guy takes 3 hours and it's worse then before, it won't start at all, just keeps restarting over and over. And the repair guy installed the LCD cord THROUGH the hinge of the laptop. So the first time you open the screen, the hinge breaks.Then I ask dell for an exchange because it was well under 30 days, but they won't exchange it because it has had a service call to it.So they send me a box to mail to their repair depot.Owned the laptop for 30 days now, and I haven't been able to use it at all.", "Date": "December 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Can't beat it for this price", "Author": "Qiong Jia", "ReviewID": "R319DT1LXLFI66", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pro:1.This laptop acts like a desktop.  No lagging with anything.2.HDMI input/output.3. 3 harddrive spaces.4. RAM upgradable to 32G.5. Excellent cooling for laptop.6. Easy upgrade/repair.  2 screws will open up the entire bottom section of the laptop.  It is actually easier to work on this than my gaming rig desktop.7. Nice LED light show on the chassis.Con:1.  Keyboard does not support gaming too well.  There are certain combination keys that will not work.  The touchpad does not work with AWSD keys together.  I think it is the design of the keyboard buses.  Too many keys sharing the same bus.  I had to either change the key functions or a separate keyboard/mouse.2.  No eject button for DVD drive.  I must use eject function in OS.3.  I got the cheap TN screen.  The color is not as vibrant.  I will probably upgrade it to IPS.4. Weight and size.  It barely fits in my laptop backpack.Summary:  I would recommend this laptop to anyone who wants desktop replacement/gaming laptop.  As long as you don't travel a lot with it.  Then, this is true for most gaming laptops, except maybe the Razer Blade pro.  Even that thing is a handful.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Dell  Alienware AlW17-3745sLV 17", "Author": "Charles Edward Adams, Jr.", "ReviewID": "R1E933U73Z8TI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very well built study laptopSatisfied with everything so farexcept for the on board speaker systemsFor the cost of this unit  they could have put in somethingsimilar to the  old big  Mac Pro , which I have and has really good on board sound.The sound on this unit is very tin cannish and has no bass bottom end.If the sound was better i would have given this a 5 star.thanks", "Date": "March 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "This is a great laptop, but too bulky to limit its use", "Author": "dongkuixing", "ReviewID": "R3GFLJJBP7HBN3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great laptop, but too bulky to limit its use, I love this.it is so cool and Beautiful", "Date": "February 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "fancy laptop!", "Author": "SIHAN CHEN", "ReviewID": "R1E2SHDEH1YE98", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can change color light by myself and run all kinds of games.
