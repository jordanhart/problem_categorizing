After a lot of back and forth Toshiba will replace the drive free of charge again for which I am greatful but I am saving up for a new laptop!ETA again:I finally received my laptop back- hard drive repaired but now the fan does not work!!

The problem with this model is, the processor uses 10-year-old technology. It's the slowest on the market.I see some of the reviewers bought this at Walmart (for $278-$300). I would NOT buy this laptop for that price. I strongly recommend a Toshiba Satellite, but this model was specifically made for Walmart & discount stores, with the cheapest possible chip.The chip used here has a clock speed of 510, which is pathetic (CPUbenchmark-net). For LESS MONEY, you can get a Toshiba Satellite right here on Amazon with clock speeds of 800-1,200. If you've come here looking for a Toshiba Satellite, this is a good company and a good brand, just don't buy the \"Walmart version\".There are plenty of options right here on Amazon for under $400 (just look at the processor type, and look it up at the CPUbenchmark site - 800-1,000 should be the minimum by today's standards). And, don't think that faster chips means it will cost more. Actually, it may cost less.That said, let me proceed to the review:PRO's:-We tested a dozen models, and except for variations in speed, all the models were great.-Screen is fine - no complaints. (I would not recommend the Toshiba models with the Trubrite screen - models with the TruBrite cost about $100 more & it picks up lots of reflections.)-I'm fairly impressed with the battery. I also have a netbook with a 10 hour battery life, but for a full sized laptop these are great. For normal use (internet, some music, etc) I get 2-3 hours. If I'm just working on data offline, I get 4.5 hours.-Stays very cool (even when playing videos), and the fan rarely kicks on.-It's light weight & durable. My 12-month old will pound on the keys occasionally, and it holds up just fine.-Comes with built-in antivirus software. I recommend also installing Avira, and every computer/laptop you own should be running Hostsman (both are free downloads).CON's:-No built-in camera or mic.-Sound is not great. Most people assume it's cheap speakers, but it's not. Speakers are fine - but the sound driver itself is the problem for some reason. You can uninstall the driver & have Windows install a generic driver that will boost your sound levels by 50% (easier said than done in Windows 7).-This model lacks the numeric keypad on the side. I would not buy a model without the keypad - with page up/page down, and other shortcuts, it's very convenient.Bottom Line: (1) Please be an INFORMED consumer. Don't pay more because you think they're higher quality, but also don't buy the cheapie because you think it's a good deal. (2) Unless you need a super-computer for specialized programming, you should be able to find a Toshiba Satellite with a great processor & all the amenities you need for under $400, right here on Amazon.Hope this helps, and enjoy your new laptop!", "Date": "February 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Terrible Laptop Don't Buy", "Author": "Anthony", "ReviewID": "R2HL9K2V0N09ZF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "From the first day I got this this thing ran hot.

Several days later I am contacted by Toshiba and told that the LCD is damaged and this is not covered under their warranty because it is considerded customer damage. My argument was how do you damage a computer simply by opening the case and turning it on? In my estimation this computer is a cheap piece of junk, less than 3 months after purchase it is damaged and the company does not stand behind their 1 yr warranty. Avoid at all cost, I will end up having to replace this computer because of the price it cost to repair it.

Well, I should have bought the 4 that Walmart had in stock the day I was there. Instead I ONLY bought two of these AMAZING laptops. I am beyond pleased with this purchase. The processor speed is insanely fast! I can run multiple programs that require a heavy load on the AMD chip. I am very very pleased. This computer does EVERYTHING I need it to do instantly. The only problem I have is that I could have bought 4 of these and I didn't. I have one still in the box I am saving for my Daughter who starts college Fall 2012. I will give it to her a week before school starts so she can familiarize herself with it. I will probably pull it out of its new packaging next week. (Feb 1, 2011) to make sure everything works just fine, then I will package it back up and save it for her. The peace of mind I have is that I ONLY paid 278, plus I bought a 3 year warranty from Walmart, that even covers accidental damage. Thats AWESOME!!! Folks you cant go wrong on this computer.

For me a perfect laptop is one that is not dog slow like a netbook and also one that won't incinerate. :)  This one so far comes out like a champ on both fronts, after about 3 months of moderate use.I've tried netbooks and found them unusable because they are way too slow for my purposes, which includes using some pretty heavy and cumbersome programming IDEs in Java that themselves tend to be dog slow.  This machine is fine with those.  This machine is not super-fast or anything but good enough for those type of things, unlike the netbooks, which are brought to their knees weeping and stuttering by those aforementioned IDEs.  ;)Also the budget factor is a good thing, because it means this machine runs cooler because it only has one processor/core.  I should not need multiple cores for web browsing, email and the like.  I'm guessing the single processor core is why this thing is rarely hot to the touch.For performance, it's nice for you readers to see hard numbers, and Windows 7 makes it easy to get these:  In the Windows 7 STARTMENU+BREAK window mine has these RATINGS: 4.1 for calcs per second, 4.4 for memory ops per second, 3.1 desktop performance for Windows Aero, 4.4 for gaming and 3D business graphics, and 5.6 for disk data transfer rate.I don't mostly care about desktop performance for Windows Aero, though mine has I think all of those features turned on, including right now I'm looking at the transparent glass effect, the start-menu+tab collation of windows, the vastly improved Mac-like taskbar of Windows 7 with pop-up miniature Windows.  All that works fine here, so not sure what that 3.1 is about.But for the rest, those are respectable numbers for this price.  The 4.1 for calcs/second is perhaps the rating most of concern - a core i3 or similar will have about 5.5 here at 32 bits or a core 2 duo desktop of mine has 6.5 at 64 bits - it seems running at 64 bit gets you higher numbers there from my experience, so if you can install 64 bit Windows 7 on here, that number may go up to the 5's and you may be seeing more visible speed with the 64 bit OS, though you may have a couple non-functioning 32-bit software challenges.  (But the 32 bit stuff in theory is supposed to work fine with the Windows 64 bit operating systems.)I'm running this with the Windows 7 32 bit that it came with.  The 4.1 like I say is adequate.The battery life is pretty good too.  I'd say about two hours of steady use, though not necessarily playing movies or something taxing like that - I don't generally do that on here either.  I also don't use it for games, so no idea how it works there, probably acceptable for many though since it runs Aero decently and that requires I think a number of the same primitive support.So I'm extremely happy with this purchase.  A very nice, clean, simple cool business oriented laptop I would call it, for those like me who want respectable performance, but don't need higher levels of performance for the latest games - and notably even on the gaming front I would gather this again would be mostly just fine again!  I think many people out there would benefit from dumping their old laptop clunker and getting this bargain with Windows 7.", "Date": "March 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "price leader", "Author": "William J.
