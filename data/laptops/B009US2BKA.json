It is attractive and more importantly worked out of the box. After booting, I went immediately to Windows update and downloaded 61 updates and all loaded successfully. This little beastthen recognized my other system computers and downloaded music and software for various printers. I have been able to load and run older versions of Microsoft Office, Dragon Naturally Speaking,download video and music from the Teaching Company and and Amazon as well as update Skype..... The keyboard is perfect for my ratherweak touch, but not overly sensitive. Multiple open programs work quickly. I was expecting that an i3 would be slower and have hesitancy with all that I threw at itbut it just churned on. I have not tested the HDMI port yet but will update the review later.One reviewer mentioned that the Windows 8 update would be problematic, but I don't think so. I see also that the links for the 15 dollar rebate AND the Windows 8 upgrade for 14.99 have been restored and I was able to register this computer at Dell Advantage.. no problem.The service tag is present both on the box AND below the battery. A manual of the computer's specs can be easily downloaded at DELL.I really do see more rapid data transfer with the USB 3 ports. There are  four USB ports not three and the aforementioned  HDMI.This is my sixth or seventh Dell computer in the last several years. While they all have some  battle-scars (mostly due to my travel and bad habits) and a few naggling problems; they all can still function.This computer is the least priced with the most power and ease. The sound is a bit weak and tinny but is easily remedied with a stereo connection.Thus, I would rate this computer an outstanding value, working well out of the boxand exceeding expectations. I am uncertain if the Windows 8 upgrade will be a benefit or an aggravation as this computer segued into our home network Windows 7 premium with ease and perhaps unnecessary updates are just that!I sympathize with those that received a problematic or DOA computer. Last year the same happened to me with another internet vendor (Tiger.....)and it really has taken a lot of time and effort to deal with it.My opinion would be to give this laptop a try: Amazon will always back up their warranty and it would not be difficult to ship a defective unit back.Good Luck!Update: I just tested the unit with respect to  the HDMI port functionality. I went online and streamed a lecture I had downloaded from the Teaching Company. I then projected via the HDMI port of the 15 R 5110 to a Sony internet TV. The laptop performed extremely well in both connecting to the WIFI and streaming in real time and the HDMI port to the TV via a generic Amazon HDMI cable. There were no buffering issues, hesitations or drop outs and the quality of the picture was excellent. I had to fiddle with the Sony TV controls a bit to get the audio to come thru, but when it did it was excellent. The quality was equivalent to the AV output I get from my Blue ray disc player playing ordinary DVDs. No complaints. I hope this is helpful for all of those who have doubts about this little i3 laptop. I am not a gamer but laptop is a good companion and appears to be very reliable to specs. It does not run hot. I posted a review of the generic 15 R 5110 from May 2011 in the comment(3) section of this review. I hope this helps.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just what I ordered", "Author": "M. Finn", "ReviewID": "R128O3XLR9VD0Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this a few days ago when I ordered it from a black Friday deal(yeah so that offering was not a scam, some people did get one). It was a Christmas gift so I wasn't planning on opening it. After reading the 4 reviews for the product on 11/29 I decided I better open it and check it out...cause if it can go wrong, it will...that's my luck.Anyway, I opened the box with a fair amount of trepidation, and it was in there, so far so good. Next I unpacked it and plugged it in waiting for the blue screen of death, smoke, hard drive clicking, a total lack of activity, or anyone of the myriad of other signs indicating issues with the product.Well after holding my breath for a few seconds the machine started right up, went through its initial use procedure, got online through my network and is now being updated. PERFECT, works great! No ISSUES. Was just what I ordered and arrived as described. Now I can't guarantee it will still be working in a few months, but right now I am a very satisfied buyer.To address issues in other reviews:1) I bought it with windows 7, it came with windows 7, I didn't buy it for any windows 8 upgrade special so no points off there.2) Not repacked came new in a sealed box, no points off there. I must point out that one reviewer complained that no one checked his laptop to make sure it was configured correctly prior to shipping and another complained that his had been opened, so it comes down to how do you please everyone? Me, I want mine unopened please.3) A reviewer said his did not work, mine did so no points off there. Who knows maybe he forgot to hit the start button. This one doesn't automatically turn on when opened unless it's already been turned on...hey I've seen weirder things than that, like the guy who emailed brighthouse from his home computer to complain he couldn't get online from his home computer.Bottom line I have a working Dell I3 with 750GB hard drive, internet access, and it is a 15.6 in laptop running windows 7. I have what I ordered, it works fine, so 5 stars.", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "crashes every week, Dell touchpad doesn't always work", "Author": "Dannyboy", "ReviewID": "RRDMY1YI0GLFN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "See UPDATE below, dated 3/24/13. Original review 12/12)I needed a basic laptop that was less than $500 and was dependable. I went through no less than 3 expensive HP laptops (around $2500 each) that were all lemons in less than 2 years, and had to hassle each time with the company from which I purchased them because I also bought an extended warranty. After my 3rd HP laptop crashed for the second time, I decided to buy a relatively inexpensive computer from Amazon.This was $470 with free shipping. I bought the Dell Inspiron because I really like my Dell home computer which is also an Inspiron but has a wireless keyboard. This laptop loaded up in no time at all. In less than 10 minutes I was on my work website and printing to my wireless printer. It already had MS Office 2010 installed, so all I had to do was enter in the product key. I purchased MS Office 2010 from Amazon for $94 and it came on a disc and allows downloads to 3 PCs.This laptop has a 15 inch screen which is larger than I really needed. For this reason, it's also a little heavy, but that doesn't bother me. Today I sat in an easy chair with the laptop on my lap and, surprisingly, it never got hot after working for 9 hours from home.I like the keyboard and large touchpad which gives my wrists plenty of room to rest while typing. If there is not enough room for your wrists to rest, the wrists end up resting on the edge of the laptop and can get really uncomfortable. This laptop doesn't have that problem.The one disadvantage I found, which may not be a problem for most, is that the power cord plugs into the left side of the unit. While it's still 8 feet long, with the plug being on the left side and my outlet located to my right, it didn't quite fit into the outlet located across the room. I solved this problem by plugging it into a surge protector (which will no doubt be better for the unit to protect it from surges). I still don't like the cord hanging over my legs, it would have been nice to have it plug on the right side or in the back. I consider this a minor nuisance.It is Windows 7 and has a CORE-i3 which is plenty fast for the work I do. The keyboard doesn't light up, but the display light is bright enough so it doesn't need it, even in dim overhead lighting. It has more memory than I'll ever need, and also has DVD/RW.I'm happy with my purchase. I'll never waste my money on expensive computers, especially HP, again.UPDATE: 3/24/13I am sad to report this computer is a LEMON. It crashes every week when I am in the middle of a program, despite my running Webroot Spysweeper daily before I power it off. It crashes in different programs, like MS Word, my work program, amazon.com, etc. The Dell touchpad also fails to work many times, despite my changing the sensitivity. It is frustrating to try to scroll down, only to have the screen stay in one place. Maybe not all of the Dell Inspiron laptops are lemons, but I certainly bought one. Next time I'll stick with local Best Buy and get the warranty.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice keyboard, works great", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R36TV8T1ZNS2OZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This has one of the best keyboards of any laptop I have tried.

Sen \"Ted\"", "ReviewID": "R3IDC1Z82VISZ6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop the day before Thanksgiving and had waited for 6 days. After calling Amazon customer service several times and hearing a different story from each Rep. finally found out it had never been shipped out of Amazon Warehouse.There was a UPS tracking created but they didn't have any left in the warehouse. After fighting and using different kind of languages with Amazon Customer Service Reps, suddenly they had it in the stock and gave me the lightening deal and plus an extra discount and send it to me next day with no charge.I received it 9 days later from my original order and since my old Toshiba laptop was dead for almost a month, I kind of destroyed the box in the opening so I am not sure if the seal was original.As soon as registering with Dell, I tried updating to Windows 8. Again I had to call Microsoft, since I didn't receive their e-mail with the upgrade link to Windows 8. Technician spent about 20 min and run the download after purchasing (14.99) the upgrade (haven't received the rebate from Dell yet, probably it will be another call). After a small challenge in the restart I was able to set up Windows 8 and start enjoying the laptop.This is a great laptop for the price definitely. For someone like me who is a Toshiba laptop user, I was surprised to see the quality in the screen and keyboard. I3 processor with 6GB Ram, should be enough for everyday using and again it is very good deal for the price. Bluetooth is an extra which I appreciate a lot, since I like to use my Bluetooth headphone most of the time when I am watching sports ( so wife doesn't complain about the none sense noise !).I saw another version of this laptop in Costco with little bit better features and processor it was $750. (it was windows 8). Please bear in mind that this laptop's list price was $699.I will update my review later on and change my rating if necessary, since I am expecting to use this laptop for couple of years. Hopefully I will not have to change the brand again.Update 12/21/12:After 22nd day of purchase, screen lost all the color in the task bar and became all white. I called Dell customer service and they said since it was more than 21 days after the purchase, they can replace with a refurbished lcd screen. No way I could accept a refurbished part on three weeks old laptop, I returned it to Amazon and decided not to buy any Dell computer in my lifetime. Dell is a lousy laptop manufacturer for Retail Consumers.One addition, Amazon advertise 15 dollars rebate from Dell next to the price tag. This is not true. There is no way you can get that rebate. I called multiple times and spend maybe around 10-12 hours on the phone with Cust. Reps. who has first no idea if there is a rebate, then check and learn and still do not know how to proceed and keep you wait for 20 min minimum and then calls dropped.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dell never disappoints!!", "Author": "Never received!", "ReviewID": "RNECIVVZVHFS5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this at on Thanksgiving as a lightning deal..

I have to admit,I was a little concerned about some of the reviews on here for the Dell Inspiron i15R-1633sLV 15.6-Inch Laptop, but it was so well rated everywere else that I had to consider it. It well fit my budget at $459. (I was willing to spend up to $700) I intentionally only looked at laptops with Windows 7 as I have an old engraver that will not work with Windows 8 and I needed the CD ROM/DVD player to run my old software.  (I have a mobile business and did not want an external drive). I do not pretend to be a computer expert...far from it...I have very limited knowlege and a fair amount of anxiety when it comes to computers!So, my laptop arrived today. From the time I started to open the box until the time I was finished with set up it was less than 45 minutes. That included adding my wi-fi,wireless printer and preferred search engine with all of my settings. The set up process was a breeze! It recognized and connected to my wi-fi instantly. I have opened several windows at a time, watched videos with Facebook open in another window, and downloaded some documents without any hang ups, freezing, or buffering. In other words, I have intentionally tried to create the same problems that my old laptop used to encouter.I am finding it fast and easy to use. It has many new features that I have not yet explored but my initial impression is wonderful! I will update my review later if my opinion changes!12/26/12 So, here's my update....The first night,all was well....since then I am having connectivity issues....sometimes I cannot stay connected for even 5 minutes....I spent some time on the phone with tech support last night and it did not fix my problem....I spoke to our internet service provider this evening and they are coming out to check their equipment tomorrow. (Even though our other wireless devices are working fine)....If that doesn't fix it,I will give tech support one more try...Even using my phone Hot Spot within a foot of the computer it disconnected some...(Too expensive to run that way anyway...)1/3/13... We have had 3 long calls with Dell tech support with them making adjustments in the computer, once even going into my router to adjust settings. I have also had my internet provider out to check our service. One Dell tech tried to tell me that I needed to keep it within 10-15 feet of the router. (Why not just wire it in? Why have a laptop?) I am trying to not send it back because I have now downloaded Microsoft Office and had my engraver hardware installed. (So purchasing a new one will cost me about $200 for my software again!) They are suppose to be sending a Tech to my house tomorrow to change out the wireless card \"\u00c4nd something else\"....In the mean time, my old HP (+/- 5 years old) can sit right next to it and maintain it's connection just fine! I am frustrated! It they do not fix it tomorrow, it will go back for a refund! I just hate to eat the cost of the software again!

Not something you expect to be a problem out of the box). However, after about an hour on the phone with a very helpful tech service technician from Dell, we had addressed that and now I am enjoying my new laptop. I am moving from the Macbook Pro I used the last 2.5 years for my job. To be honest, I don't feel like I am losing that much. The battery life is the biggest difference, going from about 5 hours to about 2.5. Also, the screen is not nearly as vibrant but it's by no means bad. Unlike the last PC laptop I bought several years ago at Walmart (the cheapest they had), this thing is blazing fast. I have not lost any speed or performance moving from a $1500 Macbook to a $450 Dell PC. Like I said, the Macbook was for work, so I didn't pay for it. And, after purchasing this computer, I definitely would never pay that ridiculous amount of money. It's not worth it.Yes, it's a lot heavier than my 13\" Macbook was but so what? Also, one definite positive so far is it does not get scorching hot like the Macbook did. Seriously, with that aluminum casing, that thing could leave red marks on bare legs.

One problem I had was that when printing an article from the internet at least once a day the computer would blue screen then black screen and shut off and reboot, causing whatever I was printing to be lost.

My other chief complaint is that even though this computer has Windows 7 it does not work quite the same as my middle computer.  Dell integrated some features of 7 differently and I don't care for the changes.  But I am getting used to them.  What can I do?

The technician I spoke with at the end of the day on Saturday said there was no way it could be fixed that day, and said he had to create a new work order, and it would be 2-3 MORE business days before the laptop was fixed. In the meantime, he promised that a supervisor, a SUPERVISOR, mind you, would call me on Monday between 9-11am my time.

After just 3 months, my computer would overheat to the point of automatically shutting off. I've had to take it apart, pull the heat sink off the CPU, only to find that there was almost no thermal paste, and what was left had the consistency of dried out gum. Also, the heat sink makes an arc, passing from the CPU over the graphics card part of the motherboard. The heat from the CPU just gets passed on to the graphics card, so my GPU is always about 15 to 20 degrees hotter than the CPU, which gets up to 80 degrees with just internet browsing! Horrible design.Also, the battery dies after 2 months. What's the point of having a laptop that you have to haul around the power cord or else it dies after 5 minutes?Dell lies about battery life. They said it would last 6 hours light use, 4-5 hours moderate use, and 3 hours with heavy use like gaming. Lie. When I first bought it, it lasted 1 hour with heavy use and 2.5 hours with light use. Then, like I said, the battery completely died after 2 months.Never buy a dell, period. This is not a one off situation. Search the internet about dell overheating and dell skimping on hardware.

That's a story for another review and another day however. I also purchased this laptop because I liked the other features that it offered (such as an excellent keyboard) and at a good price point. Dell does offer a great range of computers and with a very attractive selection of features.  Overall, this one is a beautiful machine and at a good price. Now for the problems, however.This is the fourth Dell computer (and first Dell laptop) that I have purchased over the years.  Of the first three Dell computers I purchased, one was DOA and had to be returned to Dell for a complete replacement. The other two died within the first few hours of operation and required a Dell tech to come to my home to repair them.And....what do you know? Exactly 2.5 hours of use of this laptop it died completely as well. That's four out of four failures on Dell computers for me. After a fruitless hour on the phone with a Dell tech, he finally informed me that I would have to ship the laptop back to Dell for repair or replacement (shipping and repair at their expense under warranty of course).  It took several other phone calls and e-mails to finally get the machine back to Dell. Right now, my laptop is somewhere in the bowels of Dell's repair depot in Houston, TX being repaired and prepared for return to me.To be fair to Dell, the problem in this laptop turned out to be a bad hard drive (not of a Dell brand and which of course was not manufactured by Dell). The problem on one of my other Dell computers also turned out to be a bad drive from another manufacturer. Also, the laptop seemed quite spiffy for the several hours that I have spent with it before it failed.Some people may call me a slow learner for continuing to purchase Dell computers even after all of these problems but it's been my experience that Dell works hard to correct situations such as these once they occur and I am eventually left with a fine computer. I do fault Dell over specific weaknesses in their service operation, such as length of time it takes for them to grasp the particular problem I am describing (even when it should be quite simple for them to do so) or my not being able to understand what the person on the other end of the phone call is saying. Unfortunately, getting caught in the Dell \"service pipeline\" is usually not a very pleasant experience.Dell service seems to be becoming aware of this however, since they now seem to redoubling their efforts to try and improve their customer satisfaction. For example, whenever I have talked with a service person recently, their supervisor gets on the phone at the end of the call and asks how the tech performed. Sometimes the supervisor will not get on the phone but will call you back later to follow-up and see if you are satisfied with the transaction and if your problem was solved to your satisfaction.Also, I notice that Dell is starting now to respond to negative reviews on Amazon by providing soothing balm and apologies for the user's poor experience and by providing a list of other \"options\" such as their \"Dell Cares\", \"Dell Community Forums\", \"Facebook Account\", etc. I have tried those options and found them either only marginally useful or completely unuseful.  This entire process seems to be an attempt at damage control.Only time will tell if I have any other problems with this laptop once it is returned to me. My other Dells settled down and performed quite well after their initial problems however. The oldest one, a Dimension has been performing flawlessly (knock on wood) for 15 years now after being replaced originally. One of the other ones is less than a year old. I do not regret this laptop purchase however since it seems as if it is a great machine for my particular needs. I just wish the darned thing had worked and I will update this review as necessary once I receive my computer again and can start (hopefully) using it for real! Right now, I have given this review a marginal 3 stars (barely above 2 stars). If the machine settles down and works as well as my other Dells have once repaired, I would consider it a 5 star machine!", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Product was non functional", "Author": "Mark Haugen", "ReviewID": "R33PKMP5WRFYCL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "As soon as I recieved it I had to call Dell and have their techs take control of the laptop to install a new wi-fi chip..( which I ended up having to finish.
