{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Avoid this computer, or Lenovo altogether.", "Author": "Elisa Lambert", "ReviewID": "R2QDN81WQU99AQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My experience of this computer has not been good at all, neither has my experience with Lenovo customer service-- I will disclaim and say I may have gotten one of those rare fluke computers that doesn't work-- still, based on my personal experience, I would say avoid this computer and maybe even avoid Lenovo altogether.I went with Lenovo because I read everywhere that it is supposed to be one of the top brands. I use my computer quite frequently for work, so I wanted something dependable, but I didn't need anything fancy. This computer was rated higher than many other similar brands in its class, so I decided to give Lenovo a try.From the beginning this computer has acted like a Windows 95. It constantly freezes, and is extremely slow, and its performance has been very bad. It occasionally blacks outs as well. It has had trouble just running Google Chrome and Word, let alone anything else. This computer acts like a 5 year old computer, and is not performing at the quality that a brand new (Lenovo) computer should. Even just as a computer meant for simple tasks, this one has failed to be useful. I was shipped a faulty product and have been extremely disappointed in the quality of this computer. The computer also constantly disconnects from the Internet and lines have appeared on the screen.Moreover, I have found the Lenovo customer service to be extremely unhelpful. The process to try to get a replacement or my money back has been bureaucratic and frustrating. Lenovo has been dragging their heels for over a month now, and after multiple phone calls, I haven't been able to talk to anyone who can really help me. You would think that if someone gives you a faulty product, getting a refund would be pretty simple, particularly if you express that the need for a good computer is very urgent (as I have told them multiple times). I feel like Lenovo has stolen $500, and I am very unhappy with their response to this situation. I do not feel like they value me as a customer at all, so I will be taking my business elsewhere next time.I know Lenovo is supposed to be great, and if it hadn't been for the laborious process, I might have considered giving them another shot. But now, after my experience, I definitely won't be shopping Lenovo again. I hope you have a better experience with them, but if you want my advice, go for ASUS,  or another brand.", "Date": "June 9, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GPEND2M"}}
