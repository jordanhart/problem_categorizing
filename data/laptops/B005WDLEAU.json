Overall, it's a pretty good laptop. It's not a gaming machine, by any means, but that's not what it was purchased for. The negatives are as follows:Offset touchpad - This thing is so far off to the left that it's almost uncomfortable to use. It's aligned directly behind the spacebar, but due to the full numberpad, the spacebar is not centered on the laptop itself. Also, it's very easy to accidentally hit the touchpad with the edge of your hand while typing. This can cause the cursor to move to some random point in a document, or cause you to accidentally click on a link on a webpage while you're filling out an entry field. Definitely an inconvenience, and definitely something that should have been thought of when Gateway was designing this product.Speakers - Point blank, the volume level at max is still a whisper. My iPhone has louder (and better quality) speakers than this laptop does.Those are the two major downsides to this product. It's a good laptop, but it's definitely got some flaws that people should be aware of before buying it.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent bang for your buck", "Author": "c", "ReviewID": "R1XKSBL985BBTD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent laptop features second generation sandy bridge i3 processor which is more than capable of handling any power hungry programs.  The casing is beautiful and is a quality build being a gateway.  The lappy is also super cool and quiet which is a huge plus.  I didn't have any problem with the mouse, in fact I found it quite responsive and the keyboard is great.  I shopped around for months looking for a quality unit that is above an entry level laptop for an entry level price and this is it.  Couldn't be happier with my purchase.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "great price for a great machine!!!", "Author": "Raptor0135", "ReviewID": "R108XOKJU0NWFW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Intel i3 dual-core processor( two processors in one, can perform operations up to twice as fast as a single processor can), 4gb of RAM and 320 Gb of hard drive for a very low price! what are you waiting for!?!?Bougth this laptop on black friday. wanted to update my old gateway i have had for the last 4 years. I know gateway is not one of the \"best\" or biggest brands out there, but i must say that this is still a great product that can go face to face with Sony, Toshiba and HP.The only reason why i bought this laptop was because i have had a gateway for the last 4 years as i mentioned before, and never had any software or hardware problems with it. Its being 4 days since i got this laptop and it has worked perfect so far.hardware: It is just awesome! the fact that it does not look like any other laptop out there makes it unique. The texture and desing is  the keyboard is very easy and accesible, the F or \"functions\" keys are just very helpfull and easy to control. I think the best thing about it is that it has all you want to do built-in on the keyboard, so you don't have any \" extra\" keys outside the keyboard for the volume control, wifi or even changing songs. If you like simplicity and elegance, this computer will be a good choice for you for a great price, but if you thing gateway is not a good brand just get a MacBook Pro and spend $1200 on a machine that you  wont even make the most out of it. Bought it essentially for school projects and my social life ( Facebook, Youtube, MSN, Skype e.t.c). I have installed two games that require lots of RAM and i can say it does the work with very smooth graphis. ( the games are WOW and AOE III)It looks like they didn't do a very good job on the mouse pad, i have 4 main concerns about it:1. the mouse pad was placed to the very left side of the computer, and althought i haven't had any problem when typying, like another person that did a review on this previously, i will say that it looks like they made it just for left-handed people! sometimes it gets annoying when you have to move your right hand to the very left of the computer, but i guess is just a matter of time and getting used to it.2.The interaction with the mouse pad sometimes is a bit slow, when you put your finger on it, it takes about 1 or 2 seconds for the pad to recognize it and then you can move in the screen. I know it doesn't sound like a main concern but it will have a big effect when you are in a hurry and need to move along your windows really quick.3. the option to scroll down and up on the page ( to the very right side of the mouse pad) sometimes just doesn't work! It seems that it only does its job when you are working on a microsoft word document but when it comes to srcoll down on an internet browser MOST of the times doesn't work.4. They included a very nice feature on this mouse pad that i am sure most of you didn't know before. you can zoom in and out on the page that you are just by placing your two fingers next to each other and opening them(zoom in) or closing them ( zoom out), YES like a Mac! :) . Althought it's a great feature it doesn't work as perfect as it should, it frezzes or even do the oppossite SOMETIMES.15.6\" is a very descent size, i am not a a very big fan of small computers. Althought the size may seem too much for some people, i just thing is the perfect size to do just anything. it is very light and thin and it won't get warm if you keep it on a flat surface ( i guess all new computers can do that).Overall is a great choice for a very descent price, i bought it for less than it is listed here but i will definitelly recomend this product to anyone out there willing to have a very elegant and unique product with the capabibilty of doing just anything on daily basis.any other question? ask me i will be more than happy to answer! :)", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Basic Laptop", "Author": "S. Fuller", "ReviewID": "R2R1H4ZZ1YCQHQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought the Gateway NV55C56u, which is just a little update from the 54u, as a replacement for an older laptop with Windows Vista. It's performance with Windows 7 is better then the older Vista laptop, but from signon to fully ready to use is still slower then other Windows 7 Laptops. I upgraded the memmory to full 8GB for about $38 purchased from Amazon online. This was to get better performance when needed for graphic's etc. Initial setup was easy an only took a few minutes, then had to do about 8 or 9 Windows software updates once online The screen resolution is great and shows crisp images. I do not like the keyboard as much as on other laptop as it feels and looks cheaper. I also do not care for the on switch as it also feels like low quality. The offset of the touchpad to the left is a little more then other laptops and takes a while to get used to. I like the wireless and wired connections as it does process at a higher speed then older laptop that were 10/100. Have not used with webcam yet, but will update if I do use it", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Product unusable, seller juliojdavid refuses to repair/replace/refund", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Tim\"", "ReviewID": "R1U1R3S7NB037Z", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Computer began to glitch intermittently about once a week, refusing to start and going into auto-repair mode.

I bought it for less than what it's priced now at Best Buy (I think it was on sale). Anyway, I never thought this mattered because it never was a problem before but the mouse thing (can't remember the name) is way on the left, so whenever I type, my cursor accidentally goes wherever the mouse is hovering over. That is very, very annoying! I always have to go back to what I'm typing because it suddenly jumps to places I don't intend. It would've also been okay if I could just easily press a button by the mouse pad thing to disable it while I'm typing but whoever their designer is thought it'd be better if you had to hit the Fn and F6 first at the same time. Also, they also figured it'd be best to hide the Del (delete) key since users probably won't be making mistakes often. What the...?What I like about this laptop is that the keys are easy to type with. Also, since I like using the actual number pad on the right of keyboards, I find it very helpful. The volume control is 1-touch too which is very good! I don't know if they made all of these Gateway laptop series like this but I like the texture(?) surface. It makes it look different from other laptops. It's like it has a black wooden finish. ha haI say, for the price, it's great. BUT, I probably wouldn't buy this product if I'll find myself needing to buy a laptop again just because of the mouse pad thing. I have small hands and I still keep accidentally touching it! But I guess I could get used to it since it only happened once while I'm typing these paragraphs. But then again, I've been mindful of that fact, so I guess I've been careful with my left palm (which I shouldn't have to be when typing). For the price though, I think I still got a deal.", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Inferior Laptop because of a crappy keyboard", "Author": "Frankie", "ReviewID": "R1Z1T240V1YYGF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop several months ago and thought it was a great buy, even though I read reviews that others didn't like the left sided keyboard.I thought that was great since I am a southpaw.  Well I got used to that then there was an issue with the touchpad causing the cursor to jump back in the sentence until I learned I could use a wireless mouse and Fn + F6 to disable the touchpad.I thought I was getting along with this laptop because it is fast and powerful, until a fly landed on the keyboard, which I lightly swatted with a thin newsletter.That was the end of my relationship with Gateway.  Now the keys just pop up or fall over and after some research I learned this is a very crappy keyboard.I wondered when I did searches on the Gateway NV55c I would see dozens of websites with the keyboard for sale anywhere from $15 to $30.You will either have to keep buying keyboards or purchase a separate usb or wireless keyboard eventually (but that kind of defeats the purpose of buyinga laptop.  I can say with confidence. I do not recommend this laptop because you cannot get an improved keyboard. You will always be stuck with a cheesy replacement and probably repeat the same problem, I will never buy another Gateway laptop. This is the crappiest keyboard I have EVER seen anywhere.  Once a key is dislocatedits never the same again and you are constantly popping them back in place. I now have 3 keys that will never again work the way they were intended to work. So I have a touchpad laptop that I MUST use a handheld mouse with and an external keyboard.Just point me to a barebones case that works so I can rebuild it, then I will be happyUPDATE: MARCH 16, 2013I still have this laptop, could not sell it, could not find a replacement keyboard thatwas any better than the existing one so I am stuck with this laptop I STILL DISLIKE.What I had to do was crazy glue the keys back on that kept popping off.  I still find that as timegoes on new keys will pop up and need to be fixed.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS LAPTOP EVER!", "Date": "October 25, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005WDLEAU"}}
