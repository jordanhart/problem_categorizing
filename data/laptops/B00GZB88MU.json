{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Surpassed my expectations!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2NAZUC18GNNMD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is manufacturer-refurbished unit arrived in mint condition and contained the 100GB Google Drive offer intact!  The screen is crisp with sharp, easy-to-read text and the anti-glare coating works wonderfully in bright sunlit areas.  The speakers are clear and loud enough to fill a hallway but they lack depth (bass output is weak).  No matter, I prefer plugging-in my headphones to experience the best sound anyway.  The hardware is well integrated with the Chrome operating system, with smooth scrolling (like on tablets!), multi-finger touchpad gestures, and keyboard shortcuts abound.  Plus the ability to run Linux (via Crouton) simultaneously alongside the Chrome operating system transforms this little laptop into a powerful workstation for programming, digital content creation, legacy software emulation, gaming, and more.  All in all, this is the BEST laptop I have ever owned and I highly recommend it to everyone.
