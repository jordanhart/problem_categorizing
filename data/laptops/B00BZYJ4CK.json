I needed a laptop for school and sometimes when I need a computer my family all of the sudden want to use the desktop.  I purchased this as an open box item at Best Buy and had it for several months and here is my experience so far.  I haven't have much issue in connected to the WiFi at my house or at the public library and so far it doesn't drop signal unless it is bad weather or someone tripped on the WiFi cord that is plugged into the phone jack.  Even if I drop a connection, it was relatively easy to reconnect (but then again I am completely comfortable in doing this since the beginning of getting internet connection).  It boots up pretty fast compared to my Toshiba, but my Toshiba was bogged down with so many application that load at startup and disabling only marginally improved.  The battery life is pretty decent so far.  I can get about three to four hours if I dimmed the display and only did some light web surfing and typing.  I assume I would get more battery life if I turned off the wireless feature.The things I do not like about this laptop: it has Windows 8.  Don't get me wrong Windows 8 is a decent OS, if you are on a tablet but this laptop doesn't have touchscreen so it doesn't make sense to me to trying to have that feature on a laptop like this.  And what really sucks for me is that some of the programs which I need for school are not compatible with Windows 8 and the only work around is to install an VMWare and in that VMware environment install Windows 7.Another thing that kind of annoyed me is the following: The HP Support Assistant have this prompt where you need to download update to help keep your machine operational.  I am partly blaming my internet connection at home but it takes forever to download but when it comes to installing it, it takes several tries before it installs the updates and fixes.  Speaking of fixes, there is a update for an audio driver that HP encourages you to update.  I did that and the next thing I know, there is no sound coming out. I mean nothing from the speakers, the headphone jack, nothing.  It took me several hours to try to locate a solution, which ended up me doing a rollback to previous setting.  Now I am weary of installing update from them.  I guess it is not HP fault because I think the driver was from another company who makes the audio card installed on this machine.  But I must stress that you must create a restore point as soon as you get this machine.  The speakers on this machine is not that great so don't expect theater quality or even mp3 player quality.  I find the placement of the power cord odd but then again I am right-handed.I must state this, if you have a printer or any device that came out before Windows 8, you might have a bit of trouble finding a driver to make it work with Windows 8.  I have an old HP laser printer that serves me well and I struggled to find a proper driver that works with Window 8.  I found a workout but printing is erratic at best.  So I guess I will have to purchase another printer in the future that works with Windows 8.In short, this is a okay starter laptop.  I am so glad that HP included a update/patch that recreates the start button.  I know that is such a small thing to bring up but to me it seems so wasteful of mouse click to try to find the application you want to use and I hate a cluttered desktop so this is something I wanted for so long.  Why Microsoft got rid of it, I have no clue.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "In love with this laptop!", "Author": "Dan", "ReviewID": "RRCXUSXXQ4Q4U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Talk about a value for what this laptop carries!
