The performance of laptop for Matlab, Solidworks and Arena is similar to Pentium 2 733 desktop Pc. I donot suggest you ,if you are planning to use some programs which require more cpu power.

Cd writer causes problems sometimes. I have to fix it to write a cd. Appearance : It has a good looking.

It is sleek and the display is great, but good luck if you need tech support! I installed DeLorme's Street Atlas 2003 and Earthmate GPS. It wouldn't run even after I followed all of their trouble-shooting advice. When I called DeLorme they refused to help and told me it was a hardware problem. Toshiba's tech support person was foreign and almost unintelligible. I was not impressed with what I COULD understand. She told me my brand new 2.0 GHz, 256 MB computer with XP Pro \"probably doesn't have enough space on the hard drive to run the program.\" When I insisted my laptop met minimum requirements she told me it must be a Windows OS problem! Moral? Dude, I'm getting a Dell!", "Date": "July 17, 2003"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00009RTR6"}}
