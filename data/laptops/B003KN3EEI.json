The keys are a little stiff when you first bust it outta the box, but that eases up with time. Also, your version of WORD on the computer is only a trial version, which isn't cool if you're primarily a typer/writer, but you do get 60 free days of Norton internet security, which I always recommend you get, because nothing protects you better.Two thumbs way way up.", "Date": "October 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Where has the sound gone?", "Author": "C.

This is a monumental pain, since I am travelling outside of the US and I use the laptop for presentations. I am very unhappy indeed about this development.", "Date": "October 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "HP Customer Service and Quality are horrible", "Author": "Glenn Luck", "ReviewID": "RO256K5SE59KU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased a Pavillion. Just a few months after the 1 year warranty expired the video card went out.  The problem was related to a faulty solder that could not withstand higher temperatures.  Despite the fact that the solder was defective, they said they would only fix the problem if I paid $500.  Thanks a lot HP.", "Date": "December 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awful input.  Do not buy.", "Author": "Christopher R. Bush", "ReviewID": "RIXW2CJBD3X21", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The boss found these on special and got 3 for the office, and I got one.  I hate it SO MUCH! The trackpad is absolutely awful - extremely temperamental, fails to register clicks very frequently.  Additionally, the keyboard has these extra keys along the left side.  They open your email, web browser, the \"hp media center\", the calculator, or the print dialog.  They are pointless and extremely easy to accidentally hit, so you bring up the calculator in the middle of typing an email, for example.  Additionally, while you can remap most of the keys using hacks, you can't remap the print key without remapping the \"P\" key also.  Idiotic design.  Did HP's engineers ever use this?  They should be sentenced to using nothing but this machine for the next year.It's fine when using an external mouse & keyboard.  But IT'S A FRIGGIN' LAPTOP IT SHOULD BE USABLE ON MY DAMN LAP!!!", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003KN3EEI"}}
