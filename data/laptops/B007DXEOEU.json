This laptop is really a hell of a value for the price. Screen looks great, build is sturdy. It has everything you need, except maybe blu-ray. Yes, it's not the absolute fastest, but it's still pretty fast. And guess what - just a few years ago, top of the line computers weren't even as fast as this one, and we did just fine. For the price of a top of the line computer, you can buy like 4 of these. You really can't beat that deal! I just feel bad wondering what slave labor must have been involved to keep the price so low.", "Date": "November 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "product performance and prior consumer of a compaq desktop", "Author": "peter", "ReviewID": "R8ASWX0FJPFS9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I chose this rating because the product met my expectations, I like that it has a 1yr  warranty which gav", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "price", "Author": "Frank", "ReviewID": "R2CL9P5EAP3VI3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I found this laptop at Walmart last week $228I know, it's a special price butyou can save money...", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "garbage", "Author": "John J.

Wow..No idea it was possible for anything to be this cheap. Speakers are no where near loud enough so I have to plug in powered speakers or head phones. No big deal in itself but the jack or plug doesn't get a good connection. Jiggle jiggle jiggle then stabilize the wire so it doesnt hang and cant move....I wont continue with everything I have done trying to keep the sound but it is the cheap computer. I know this because I have tried 2 sets of head phones and 2 pair of speakers and none of them work properly.  Watching hulu or netflix it pauses 4 to 30 times an hour. It has froze up several times in the first 3 months of having it...OH  2 days here and a button or key just fell off it.  I have no idea what it was ...3rd on left from the space bar.  Sometimes its dial up slow and I have high speed-comcast. Yuppers, ya get what ya pay for. However this has been crap since day one so if they dont even make an effort to put out a quality product on their cheaper stuff there is no way compaq will ever get any more of my money in the future.", "Date": "June 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works", "Author": "Brandon N", "ReviewID": "R3IKNT2LUR3XVV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I picked mine up at a pawn shop for about $190 and it was the cheapest they had.I haven't had a computer better than this, but know how they are. This computer doesn't exactly handle multitasking well, and it can have some issues with lagging behind after a few hours of intense use. The processor is absolute garbage, it's about as slow as it could be, and the RAM amount isn't much better. It is however USEABLE for gaming. I am a PC Gamer and haven't had any problems with most games I play. Most things I do run fine, with a little lagg on response time here and there.
