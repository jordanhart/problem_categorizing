This AMD 10 is incredible. So far it is flawless.  I love the screen clarity especially on my Slingbox streaming.

Singh", "ReviewID": "R1XJFSINDZT0V9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop from a different retailer for a much cheaper rate than what's listed here but I thought I'd write my review here as well.Pros:Touch screenBacklit KeyboardBig touchpadKeyboard is very pleasant to type onAMD A10/8560G Graphics APUVery lightVery thinPowerful speakers, says it has 4.6GB ram, better than the usual 4GB, up to a max of 12, which is pretty good.Cons:Dpad is the half key style which is terrible and barely usable being so smallTouchpad drivers aren't the best. 3 finger tapping can be enabled but doesn't work right.Touchpad has too much friction is nearly impossible to use with default settings for scrolling. (I reversed 2 finger scrolling for usability); If the touchpad was smooth instead of this texture it'd be much more easy to use.Battery life is a bit short but does meet the 4 hour usage time.Other:Screen resolution is a bit low at 1366x768Could have better viewing angles.These aren't cons because these are things are pretty standard.This laptop has an APU rather than a regular CPU, this means that the graphics \"card\" is built directly into the Cpu's chip; both the cpu and gpu being on that single chip. Intel has started to do something similar but currently AMD is leading in graphics of course. This particular APU is the best AMD offers and at a sub $600 price is better than the intel offerings. To beat the performance of this chip, you'd need an i5 (no i3) or better and a powerful nvidia graphics chip to compare.I am not one who is fond of Acer and for a long time this company has had quite suspect quality. But recently Acer has changed and have been paying more attention to quality, this notebook is proof of their efforts that has few complaints against it. This notebook looks well built and has powerful hardware that is hard to find at these lower price ranges, I believe I got a pretty good deal until the next generation of cpus and DDR4 comes out.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "It was a pleasant surprise!", "Author": "E. Chavez", "ReviewID": "R3VNHC12OQYT23", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a little hesitant to buy this computer after reading some of the bad reviews. The price was way below retail so I took a chance anyway and I am really glad that I did. I'm not to fond of  the windows 8 interface, but all of the new computers ship with it so I can't fault them there. Im a photographer on a tight budget, so I needed a high performance laptop at a low price $499 was a steal. Overall the performance is amazing! It runs Photoshop and adobe lightroom with little lag and it exports 24mp images very fast. The built in graphics card is good enough to play a lot of 3D games. The screen is crystal clear and very bright. There is a little bit of glare outside or near bright windows. I'm also a huge fan of the 4 built in Dolby digital speakers, really loud with out distortion. Its a really great buy and I would highly recommend it.", "Date": "April 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Breath taking", "Author": "Hanszamora", "ReviewID": "R3SHZW2GJ5XCD3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love this laptop!!

I had 5 or 6 main criteria for the computer,1 Bench test at least twice as fast as my old computer2 be under 500$3 have decente graphics4. have usb 35. have HDMI out6 Have full keyboardThis computer meets all of those and more.I pulled the SSD from my old computer and put it in the new one, This provided Marked Improvement in boot times, read/write times and general responsiveness, and being that I do quite a bit of photoshopping and video editing, I needed more memory.Luckily the 4 gb stick from my old computer fit perfectly. giving me 8gb.after the upgrades which only costed roughly 150$ 2 years ago, I was very pleased with the improvements in performance, Battery life, and useability of the computer.even before the upgrades, the computer benchmarks in the 4000 range which is a tremendous improvement over the 1800 range for my old computer. which had a 2.4ghz processor 8gb of ram, and a 256ssd.I checked every laptop I could find under 500$ and this one spec'd far better than the rest of them, this alone should be motivation for buying.I was familiar with windows 8. And didn't like it, but decided to give it a try with this computer being as it had a touch screen. in the beginning, there were a few bugs, ie. google chrome desktop would crash every couple of days, and mircosoft office 2013 would stall when opening more than one project. I was frustrated, but microsoft and google quickly remedied the issues and now both work great.I do not like, But do not use the touchpad, it is very unusual, and not intuitive, but the accuracy and response of the touch screen more than make up for it.if you are hesitant about windows 8, I say just make the plunge, as long as your computer has a touch screen. it is awful without it. but with it, it's brilliant, hands down the best thing to happen to windows since chips challenge on windows 98.overall:pros: - excellent value, could not find a better computer for the money- excellent battery life 5 or 6 hours per charge with ssd- responsive touch screen- windows 8- solid build, metal chassis with plastic exterior. should hold up well for a few years,(although one corner makes a clicky noise when you press on it. after 5 months of use- full keyboard- hdmi out, coupled with hippo remote turns this into a great video streamer, My nephews and I use it to play emulated  N64 and SNES games on the bigscreen- usb 3 is super fast.- handles anything I throw at it from editing photos to videos.Cons- awful touchpad- bland design- windows 8 bugs in the beginings, now fixed  as of 4/29/14-lacking cd drive, which makes installing old software a pain in the butt- oddly placed powerbutton - i turn off the computer whenever i try to plug in a usb cableyou won't be disappointed.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Cannot come close to beating this deal", "Author": "Steven M. Buell", "ReviewID": "R2510V1EH9CD62", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It great especially for the buck spent on it. This is replacing my Acer TimelineX, which was an incredible machine but have a sickness that has me purchasing a new laptop all to often.  Overall the performance is great on this new machine, the sound quality of the speakers is outstanding, the screen quality is outstanding, the touch screen is sweet didn't think i would like it as much as I do, the only concern is it seemed to get a little warm at first, and the fan was a bit noisy, but since most recent Windows update it seems to be running fine and have not noticed the issue, guessing it was a outdated driver or something.  After owning this for several days to make sure it was the right fit, I decided to purchase a  SSD, so I just in installed Samsung 840 Evo SSD, now this thing fires up in seconds, boot to desktop load speed is amazing now, launching and closing programs is close to instant.  Great laptop stock and especially great with an SSD.Pros- Good performance (would rather have an I-5 processor), touch screen is a nice feature, nice style, thin/compact design.Cons - Only one memory slot which is annoying. They did not make it easy to access internals to change memory, hard drive, etc. Ports in back (have some advantage, but also annoying).  Not necessarily a con but no optical drive. The touch pad is positioned such that this would be good for someone that is left handed, I seem to always click the right side or in the center, kind of drives me nuts, have never had this issue with a laptop.  Seems to run kind of hot and is a bit noisier compared to my last Acer.  Having the USB 3.0 and HDMI in some ways is annoying and difficult, I have come close a couple of times forgetting that my USB drive was plugged in back there and almost had it destroyed.  Decent laptop but there are a definitely a few things to be aware of.", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Have to reset on day 1", "Author": "Ehan", "ReviewID": "R18HV7B0ZIJGLR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The price is great for a computer with settings like this one so I bought it. Shipping is fast. I got it the second business day after I bought it. The design is new, Windows 8 works well. The first software I installed was Chrome and this laptop dead after the first time I open the Chrome. Then I have to reset the computer that will take about 8 hours. So by far, it is still resetting and I have not had a chance to even try the computer. Even though I still believe this computer is a decent computer with the discounted price, and I really do not care about dvd drive. I also wonder if it is because of  Win 8 not complying with Chrome. I just do not like that I have to reset computer on the first day to use it.

I Play games for like 8 hours straight , it doesn't heat up  much and no freeze or any sort of issue. Games I play are MMO's like Path of Exile, DC universe Online, Neverwinter. And games like Fallout new vegas in ultra graphics.The touch screen is awesome and this PC is super easy to use! Plus that windows 8 is amazing, especially when you update to 8.1. Ohh yeah and the space on this baby is great too. My Xbox 1 has 250Gb less lol.But yeah I bought it for light gaming but it turned out to be able to handle much more than that! Super Fast Quad core for multi tasking. And I Love the snap feature. I play games and Snap SKype my bud all at the same time. Super clean PC. for $500 I got a lot more than what I payed for honestly.I recommend this to anyone looking for a great Sexy looking PC that can handle good games. Oh! And of course it can Run Skyrim on ultra settings. Looks beautiful. Just put an HDMI to your tv and you're all set!OH ONE BIG THING. Buy an amazon basics mouse because the touch pad isn't the best sadly lol.

This laptop does it as expected. The post doesnt say but backlit keyboard is inclusive....i think the P in the name (552P) stands for touch screen  and I think that all v5 touch have backlit keyboard. Battery life is good. they advertise 4.5 hrs.....with wifi on and power settings set to save battery power, u get almost 4 hrs. Battery is built in though :/ but there is  a button u can press to  \"simulate\" taking the battery out and placing it back in. The laptop looks sexy ,I must say. The track pad is hugeeeeeee....the size of the smooth part surrounding the track pad is too long, my wrists  hurt :(.  Speaker are so LOUD. Its like this is too much :D. The mic and phone jack is combine :/. I have installed some games.....they run nice without mods on low- medium settings: far cry3,simscity,mass effect 2,batman arkham origins,civ 5 and sniper ghost warrior 2.

Received it pretty quickly, and it worked amazing...for those 2 months. One night was watching Netflix and the screen and sound stuttered, then froze. Recovered after a few minutes. I downloaded HW Monitor AND Core Temp to check temperatures and was pretty bothered with what I found. My CPU was sitting at over 100 degrees CELSIUS. That's over 200 degrees F! At around mid 80 and up degrees Celsius is when the CPU starts going out. Don't bother buying. Also, if you decide to buy this or any other laptop, don't bother buying from \"uShopMall (Tax Free)\" as the Seller. I bought this laptop from them, and after it went out their support on this matter with a return or replacement was TERRIBLE.

I am a very cautious person and likes to compare items. I decided to purchase this after consulting with 3 of my IT experts, all work for Intel and Microsoft, and they all agreed that this is a great laptop. The price is right, the CPU is fast, and the design is so light. It's very modern and chic. However I am not thoroughly satisfied with it.Pros: Touchscreen, fast, modernized look, fashionable, light.Cons: Mouse pad sucks, keyboard isn't as high as I thought, sometimes the computer froze, battery life is short (4 hr 30 mins).Overall, this is a great computer for students like me who is looking for a temporary replacement until I can graduate college and get a job.

Big disappointment. Clicking on apps took ten seconds or more to open. Tried to download Windows updates but didn't have the patience to wait for hours over a 10 mbs per sec. connection. On top of this the screen was washed out and had little contrast. I recently updated a seven year old HP desk top to Windows 8 and added a touchscreen monitor and all went smoothly. The old computer  had no problem with updating Windows 8 to 8.1. With this I couldn't even get that far. It would not download updates to apps from the Windows Store. It seemed like a bargain but sometimes you don't get what you pay for.I am now restoring it to factory settings so I can return it. It has been doing this for two hours and is 22% complete, sloooow.
