{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice laptop!", "Author": "Grateful Bob", "ReviewID": "R2R1IPE0ELD71M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like most things about the laptop.  The aluminum case seems to stay cool even after long use.  The laptop came with Windows 7, which is what I wanted.  (Windows 8 needs to be dumped by Microsoft ASAP!)  The 3.0 USB port is very fast.  It seems like I move files back and forth between the hard drive and a flash drive almost instantly. The screen is very readable.  The computer came with enough RAM (4 gb) to suit my needs and a large enough hard drive.  The I3 dual-core processor is way faster than my other laptop.I do not like the placement of the \"mouse\" pointing device -- it is off-center to the left, so I constantly click the right rather than the left button.  I also have trouble with gestures, which I should just turn off in order to make the pad act more like a traditional mouse.  I wish that the keyboard had a numeric keypad separated from the regular keyboard.But overall, this was an inexpensive good choice for my needs.", "Date": "April 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great school laptop", "Author": "Chris Burns", "ReviewID": "R25HGYAPTD9PRY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great computer for the money.
