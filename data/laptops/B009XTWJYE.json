{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great computer", "Author": "Jack", "ReviewID": "R14JJS27TAZCML", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I actually purchased this laptop a week ag from Staples - for about $100 less than the Amazon price. I love it! I agree, Windows 8 takes some getting used to, but the more I use it the more comfortable I am with it. I simply use the Windows 7 desktop that I can easily access from the \"Metro\" desktop that comes up when I first log on. Also, the Metro desktop shows all the files and program shortcuts that I have on my Windows 7 desktop. They are located over on the extreme right side of the display, and so its only takes a second to get to the programs I use...without even having to go to the Windows 7 desktop.I love the nice, crisp display. The keyboard is like silk and it's size makes it, at least for me, very easy to use. The Fn keys are useful, and having a separate number pad is terrific. This laptop also has both USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 outlets, which is a real plus. The only thing that is a very slight disappointment is that the battery only last 4 hours, but considering that the battery on the 7 year old Toshiba I had been struggling with (as a second computer just for email and writing)only lasted 15 minutes, 4 hours is a breath of fresh air.I would buy this computer over and over again. It seems to be a fantastic machine.Additional comments two weeks later:I still really like this machine, with just one complaint...the display has a blue cast that is impossible to get rid of, no matter how many color corrections I try. I've been able to reduce the  blue cast significantly, but if I go try to reduce it further in the color cast setting or in the processor settings, the cast starts turning green or red. Since I use this computer to do some photo editing, I'll just have to make the color cast corrections (which are usually only white balance changes) with my desktop that has a 22\" ViewSonic LED and is connected directly to the printer. I have tried three HP G7 laptops, two with AMD processors and one with the Intel i3 processor, and they all have the same cast, so it's the display and not the processor. If anybody has any success correcting this, let me know.Incidentally, I LOVE Windows 8. Nearly all the low ratings for this computer are because of Windows 8 and not the computer itself. I've been through XP, Windows 7, and now Windows 8, and I think 8 is far better than the other two. Here's what I like so far:  The charms provide easy and quick access to all those files, folders, programs, and system tools that were so darn hard to find, particularly if they're in the control panel. Just type in the name of what you are looking for and the links to the item show up instantly. Very cool.  I can switch back and forth between the media window and the traditional Windows 7 desktop with a simple push of the windows button on the lower left side of the keyboard. And get this - every program I install has a shortcut on the traditional desktop AND the media desktop. Since they open at least three times faster when I access them on the media desktop, I always start there. And...with some patience, I've been able to move all the programs I use to the left side of the media desktop so they are front and center on my display at startup; a piece of cake.  One aggravation is that I have not figured out how to make a shortcut to the system tools I use - \"create a restore point\" and \"computer management\" to put on the desktop. If anybody knows how, please let me know because I use these tools a lot.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great notebook!", "Author": "Richard Perdue \"sage533\"", "ReviewID": "R3JRXBTS1UL8MP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have bought several lately of various brands, 2 of this one for me and my wife.

Once I got it up and going, I immediately installed all updates (91!  Yikes!) and downloaded Windows 8.1.  Then I installed Classic Shell and set it to automatically boot to the desktop.  I couldn't be happier with it now.  My game library on steam plays like a charm (I don't have the newest games, but it's easily able to handle say, Portal and Portal 2).  The speakers are loud and crisp, and while I thought I'd totally hate the apps, having the netflix app running while simultaneously working on my desktop is well nigh magical.  The screen is bright and vivid, and the whole machine feels solid without feeling bulky.  It's light years better than my old Dell, or even the Macbook I had before that.

I upgraded from a 15.6 inch display to this 17.3 inch display which makes a huge difference. The screen is sharp and vibrant with pretty good contrast among indoor lighting conditions. It is not a touch screen. The keyboard area is large and keys well-spaced if a touch small. The numerical keypad is a nice touch and the function keys are intuitive and responsive. The touchpad works well, but I have always found the \"touch gestures\" somewhat superfluous and this time is no different. This machine is powerful enough to handle Windows 8 which the kids and I adapted to fairly quickly, but some may prefer the Windows 7 shell. My only real gripe with Windows 8 is the laborious shut down sequence. This machine is not meant to be a tablet and needs shut downs and restarts occasionally. So far performance has been reliable with the gamut of standard household programs, such as internet to word processing executed without complaint.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "OK, buy for the money", "Author": "John Grimm", "ReviewID": "R10H6G7WYG7RD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I hesitated on this one because of Windows 8, but after reading the reviews on Windows I went ahead.  Windows 8 does take a little getting used to.  I set mine up with auto logon and put my browser and other apps on my start page. I also turned off gestures on the touch pad. This works great.As for the machine.  Some of the functions don't work all the time, such as the power button having to be pushed just right to get it to turn on and off.  I got around this by setting the lid to power on when opened and power off when closed.  Turning the wifi on and off does not work.  There is no volume control other than windows.  No blue tooth. No \"F\" keys.I do love the extra large screen.If you are just going to do the internet, a little word processing and some photos, this might be the machine for you.", "Date": "August 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT BUY", "Author": "MJC", "ReviewID": "R385ZQ13W5S7IZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like others I have found this laptop for a much lower price (in my case $299 after rebate) at local brick and mortar office supply stores (Office Depot). It is last years model so it is on clearance. It runs fine and has a very, very nice screen and keyboard. It took a while to get used to the mouse pad but with a bit of tweaking of the settings it settled down OK. Still, it works much better with an external mouse but that is just my personal preference. Windows 8 took 1/2 to get used to but Toshiba provides a single click link to the traditional desktop. My fifth version of Windows so I guess I've gotten used to making transitions. So I am very, very happy.
