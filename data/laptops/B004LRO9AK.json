I was not looking for a gaming notebook, but as this is not much more money for a gaming notebook. Now this notebook is huge, view it as a desktop replacement. Asus has also improved and not having a ton of bloatware. It is pretty much remove from box, remove wrappers, place battery inside, and fire it up and get to work. I love the layout of it. awesome keyboard, straight forward approach.It runs quiet, and doesnt require fiddling with the setup, such a relief these days.If the P4 extreme alienware area 51m, was not a dead give away... I'm and old gamer. I was playing crush crumble and chomp and soldering 6502 microprocessors, when many of you were not even born lol.I love how the hard drive is setup with the partitions that make sense. Just be sure and setup your games on the 500gb partition and installing them there.All the normal issues with new computers I have not seen here. The manual is crap on real geeky useful information, but whose isnt these days. The designers think we are all idiots, which is mostly true, but give me useful info.. took me awhile to figure out which hdmi cable I need to hook this up to my 55in samsung.So, If you are in the need for a decent gaming notebook, and are not worried about size, weight, or battery life.You know who you are when you buy a 17in notebook which is a desktop replacement, and then post a 1 star review complaining about how heavy it is, blah blah.THIS IS A DESKTOP REPLACEMENT GAMING NOTEBOOK!it weighs in at 8 pounds, it wont fit on the drop drown tray on the airplane unless you wedge it and halfway thru your lost season 3 dvd the battery will die anyway.I am quite pleased with it as I transfer my games to this.

Shame on you Amazon.The cons although annoying are not in any way deal breakers, this is a solid laptop with screaming performance from a great company. You will not find a better laptop for the price. 4 stars on this review, lost 1 star mainly for the sound card and bloatware.

(i have asus monitors which are excellent.)i'll update this review later after the next set of tech support.--update May 25, 2011received the 2nd RMA laptop.  turnaround was quick.they replaced the keyboard (w/ a different color one for some reason) and hard drive (which now makes a clicky noise once in a while).  again, new setup.after setting up windows, it did it's asus live update and windows update... still freezes!  sometimes tries to boot, and then shuts itself down.  sometimes fails to even show bios screen... basically, the same thing as before.3rd contact to tech support in progress.--a lot of the positive reviews seem to be immediate impressions.  i have to say, mine was very high as well when i first got it.  it's really the long term problems that i think this laptop has and all the little issues that seems to pop up (to me and to many others) that i never really had w/ other laptops.", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "awesome! but", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1NPN6TVUXPGNO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So, I got this beast a few days ago and the first 12-15 hours I spent debugging the other 6 hours installing updates.

I have not seen any Sandybridge-related issues after a couple of weeks of hard use.I did run into the function key issue, but there is already good documentation out there on how to fix it.  Supposedly, some of the Win 7 64 bit updates screw up ASUS' ATK drivers (and result in the function keys not working anymore).  Simply removing the ATK drivers and reinstalling from ASUS' website fixes the problem.[...]I've read that some users needed to do this twice, but that was not the case for me.  I would recommend installing all of the important Win 7 updates BEFORE re-installing the ATK drivers.There WAS quite a bit of bloatware that came with this laptop, but it is easily removable.  Some users report going to the lengths of reformatting their hard drives, but I did not find that to be necessary.  Remove the software from the control panel, and then sweep through the C:\\ to remove any remnants.  That should be more than adequate.  Most folks who need this kind of processing power out of their laptop probably have the know-how to get this done pretty quickly.I'm not sure why people are complaining about the sound quality.  Sure, it won't compare to studio monitors or your 7.1 surround system in your home theater... but it's a laptop... not sure what you were expecting.  It has good sound compared to most laptops I've heard (although probably not the best).  If you need better or bigger sound, use nice headphones... or run it through a stereo receiver.This is a big laptop.  It's not super light or super portable.  When you buy a 17.3\" laptop, you forfeit portability.  If that was a surprise to you, you should have done more research.  'Nuff said.All in all, I spent an hour or two removing bloatware, updating drivers, adding software, and downloading/installing Windows updates... and then this computer was ready to rock.  And rock it does.  I have yet to run an application or game that this workstation can't handle with ease.  The screen is sharp, the keyboard is nice, and it stays cool after hours of hard use.  That is everything I was looking for.My only real complaint is that the brick on the power cord is very big, bulky, and heavy.  It's roughly 8\"x4\"x3\", and I estimate that it weighs 3-4 lbs.  Given that this computer is intended to be used while plugged in (primarily), you can't really get away with not lugging the cord around with you.  It'd be great if ASUS did a little R&D; and shrunk it down a bit.  Is anyone aware of a reliable, safe, compatible, and SMALL power cord/conditioner that I could look into?", "Date": "May 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "EDITED: Finally fixed most: Problems ever since I got it, stutters, system restore didn't work, function keys did not work", "Author": "Chris C.", "ReviewID": "R15EMGHVCABH71", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought the ASUS G73SW-XA1 currently for sale.System restore came bugged and had to messed with to work properly.Function keys did not work properly either, had to delete drivers and reinstall ones from the website.Installed Installed Medieval Total War 2 and Shogun Total War 2.Both games have lag and stuttering issues on the campaign map and the battle maps.It more than meets the specs on Medieval and no matter what I set the graphics settings for the game (low or high) the lag issues still occur.I have tried multiple builds including with initial build, Asus auto driver updates, windows updates, and the new GTX 460M drivers seperately and all give the same problems (Note the GTX 460M updated drivers cause the screen to flicker also).Have also tried before and after uninstalling bloatware and have reset it to factory settings 3 times now with the same results.Is there any recourse for this?  This is the first item I have purchased from Amazon and it seems to be broken.I'm wondering for the people who have used it to play games what did you do to get it to actually work without lag during games?Thanks,ChrisEdit: Forgot to add whenever I run anything it sounds like the fan is on overdrive.Edit: Finally fixed stuttering you need to get the Nvidia beta drivers.Overall,PROS: higher end hardware for good priceCONS: So much work to fix the screwed up factory settings and the ASUS auto update crap.", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Asus G73SW \"Bertha\" is her name!", "Author": "Lee Haynes", "ReviewID": "R2AM87BVUC2MTB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay where should i start?First off, you're probably doing the same thing i did when deciding to buy this computer.

It's a fantastic value.  The screen is great, bright and clear with a lot of real estate for a laptop.  Big improvement over my old 17\" Dell Ultra-Sharp.  The keyboard has a solid, comfortable feel.  The system is heavy, but that's not an issue for me - it will rarely, if ever, be leaving my desk area.  There is a fair amount of bloatware that needs to be uninstalled at first use.It's very quiet yet the bottom stays cool, even during extended operation.  However, although it is fast enough, I estimate only a 15%-20% boot-up speed pick-up over my 42 month old desktop (Q6600/4 gb RAM/GeForce 8800GT w/256mb/Vista 32).I have not yet tested the system with modern games.  I do own a number of \"classic\" titles between 2 and 15 years old. Three of the more recent, World in Conflict, Company of Heroes, and Civ IV, all play easily with graphics settings at or near the maximum.If you are connecting external speakers or plan to use headphones/ear-buds extensively, I recommend turning off the THX software that is enabled by default and using the included RealTek audio software instead.  The THX software works well with the internal speakers.I have a couple small issues, the most significant of which is likely caused by my ignorance and poor documentation rather than a problem with the machine.  The keyboard lights up during the POST, then turns off and stays off.  The e-manual references <fn><space bar> as the on/off switch for the keyboard lighting, but this combination does not work for me.  The lighting button at top left only turns the lighting on and off for - wait for it - the lighting button itself plus the other two \"special\" buttons.  So the hardware works but is being overridden by a software setting that I can't locate.  Frustrating.  The documentation should be more clear.Additionally, Asus includes its own \"live update\" software that offers newer software and drivers.  If for whatever reason you choose not to accept everything that is offered, you will receive a pop-up notification a few minutes after each boot.  The only way to disable this is to uninstall the software, meaning you may miss something in the future that you actually DO want to install.  There are also no embedded descriptions explaining the updates and their purposes.There is also an \"instant-on\" capability (not Windows) that comes with a primitive but functional web browser, a music player, and some primitive casual games.  Waste of time and disk space IMO in this age of tablets and smart phones.All-in-all a very good system, but docked one star due to weak Asus software and documentation.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great laptop", "Author": "cutigeriv", "ReviewID": "RNEQ0DN146KFG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although it failed to arrive with the advertised backpack and mouse I have no regrets with my purchase.

Also it's 3d capable using a 120 Hz. external monitor and Nvidia kit(purchased separately). Great price for this quality! Can't do better elsewhere. Buy with confidence.

Usually I just read the comments and decide for myself whether the product is worthwhile, but this time, I hope to help the readers with my experience, and maybe answer the same questions I had. I spent nearly 20 hours searching for the best possible balance between price and specifications. I was hesitant on this laptop for several reasons. For one I play WoW. For those that don't know, it's a very demanding game graphically. To be honest, that was my only concern. The CPU/RAM/HD, those are the things that come standard on every machine. No gaming laptop dares to use an i5 nowadays, unless they're Alienware, in which case, you might as well burn your money before further feeding the trolls facilitating the pricing at that company. An equivalent machine from Alienware would run you over two thousand, and I checked. A 17\" AW still lacks the 1080p. Seriously? Brands shouldn't charge an extra thousand for their terrible reputation, and their customer service script reading monkeys.So the pros:-The display is simply amazing. High gloss with 1080p. Everything looks pristine. Just simply gorgeous.-I was really dreading the keyboard, based on reviews, until I was able to finally try it for myself. It's great. Bright and spaced, and has a soft touch.-The design of the laptop looks god awful on the site. Not in person. It's brilliant. Has a really unique and comfortable texture, both on the exterior and the palm rest area. Really has that stealthy high tech design the engineers were going for. Superb.-The graphics card pulls strong. The great thing is the \"dashboard\", the area near the speakers is comprised of mini buttons that interact with the motherboard. They establish the mode of power and display type. So if you're playing a game, run high performance and turn your visuals to \"Vivid\". Looks great. Or if you're watching a movie, turn it to entertainment mode and run the \"Theater\" display mode. Great innovation on this machine.The only con I have is the sound. My previous laptop was an XPS 1530, and the music on that machine, through headphones, was really amazing. I haven't spent enough time running through settings or browsing online to find the necessary configurations to run similar on this machine. I would imagine it should, but maybe the XPS just really excelled in the sound department. Regardless, small infraction for what is top notch engineering from a reputable company.By the way, Amazon is the best company bar none when it comes to customer service. I actually spent a little bit more just to order this machine from them, because regardless of the situation, I know they will actively try and help the customer. And who can beat Prime? 2 Days and I had this on my desk. Most gaming companies will take several weeks just to ship an already pre-configured machine.So for those still on the fence, get off. You will love this machine. And those complaining about the size; it's a gaming 17\" laptop. Get over it. It looks small anyhow, compared to the 27\" iMac behind it.Cheers.", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Short in Power Block cord", "Author": "Consumer", "ReviewID": "R1XY5LZF54DCTX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "3rd time I have turned this laptop on and now there is a short in the power block cord.You think you have your laptop plugged in but then it dies.

(Makes everything look extremely smooth.)  -Amazing GPU  -Light up keyboard! (Working at night has never been easier)  -Great heat dissipation. I Have had it for 6 days, have not even heard my fan come on yet. I thought i did once, but that was desktop idling in the background.  -Quick boot-up. After the first boot up, takes no longer than 3 minutes to get to my homescreen.Cons:  -Battery level. Battery is really small, only last about 2~3 hours. Which is pretty sad since i have to have it plugged in all the time. Not much of a con for me because i was looking for a desktop replacement.  -Size. This computer will not fit in your bookbag, Do not even try haha.Really the only con i hate, is battery life. Bought this on the basis that i needed something strong since ill be going to college and want to study computer science. The GPU would help a lot when it came to render times on both after effects and cinema 4d. The battery life screws me though. I wish i had more, however there is no way to turn off the GPU when not in use and instead use the one that comes with the processor. This would increase battery life as i see it, however asus didnt make such a setting available. This computer is going to be a stay at home machine. Im not going to do much moving with it. That is my only reason as to why its not getting 5 stars. At one time i got 1hr and 30mins on a charge just browsing internet. However the way i see it, you can have power, or battery life. Maybe even both. I decided on power however.Alright now down to some benchmarking!(Used Fraps with all of these!)Portal 2:  It is positively amazing. I was expecting low FPS since this is a laptop after all, however i was completely blown away. I maxed every single setting possible, and played on a 1080p resolution. I got steady 60fps. No drops ever. This was really good for me, i think im going to be playing games for a while.Fallout 3:  Set it on ultra. I get 52 fps, with 45 at its lowest. I was blown away by the amount of visual detail this was giving me. My console will never match up with this.Team Fortess 2:  This ones a doozy. Didnt play it much, however at some point I got a FPS rate of about 120 FPS. I maxed as much settings as possible and came to this. Love it a lot.Minecraft:  For the indie game lovers! I got an FPS rate of 180 FPS. Thats on high settings. Get rid of smooth lighting and such you get somewhere aroung 500~600 FPS. I did not even know so much was possible.Lastly, if any of the people reading this know of a case that i can buy for this laptop please inform me. I bought one. But unfortunately it did not fit. Stay away from generic cases. The one i bought left the back of the laptop, where the vents are, completely exposed.

End story; I invested on a $100 dollar mouse unnecessarily. The bonus items were still valid, but did not inform me, the buyer.As cool as it may be that I now have 2 very good mice, If I had known, My investment would have gone to some other peripherals I had in mind.

After sending all 4 back here is my take on ASUS and the republic of gamers laptop.  First off none were impacted by the new Sandy Beach processor (at least not that I was able to single out).  The bottom line is either you get a good one or a bad one.  Regardless some things are the same. Frist, yes there is bloatware and no two reivewers have removed it the same way and once you do there are messeage errors that haunt your system.  The lighted keyboard is sometimes working and sometimes not working.  Yes you can reload drivers or press fn and f4 or you can reboot or you can pray but in the end its always something and there are multiple ways to fix the problem however does the solution stick (I am not sure it does).  Yes sleak design and great feel, and packed with a lot of punch and amazing display....but how many times do you have to reinstall the software after you have backed it up for 2 1/2 hrs? I am not going to discuss the weight or size of battery life cause its a gaming laptop and the last 5 reviews have all been on the money.  Asus needs to pay attention to detail and take care of the things mentioned over and over again.  Yes put some things on the back of the laptop so right handed and left handed folks dont have the power cord and other devices in their way.  I believe ASUS has built the best bang for the buck and can do even better by paying atteniton to the words that others have taken time to write.

I received this computer yesterday and it is very nice.I had been looking at the 15\" for myself because it is lighter weight and even that one is very heavy, still trying to decide, however after receiving the 17\" for my son, I'm really considering getting one for myself as well.  It is heavy, truly a desktop replacement (that being said it is not as heavy as my original 2004 17\" HP that I have and I lugged that thing all over a college campus for 3 years). For reference I'm a 5'0\" tall woman.  So if you really want it to be portable, go for it!Display -- WOW!  It is the clearest, crispest display I have EVER looked at!I really like the matte, rubbery feel of the case. Absolutely no fingerprints on this baby!There didn't seem to be as much bloatware as other recent computers I've purchased, but they did pre-load a bunch of game demos, Trend Virus Protection, an MS Office launcher (buy or type in code you already have - I suppose if you already own Office 2010, it would be convenient, but I don't, so I uninstalled it) and some other miscellaneous stuff.I was surprised at the size of the battery, it seems small, but out of necessity, since the fans go on either side of the computer and have ducts running from front to back.  Again, it's supposed to be a desktop replacement, so I'm thinking they assumed most people will have this computer plugged in most of the time.Immediately picked up my network and asked for password, instant internet.Keyboard has small chicklet keys.  I prefer this style keyboard, my Sony Vaio has the same thing and I really like it.  Hardly any noise from keys, nice that it is backlit like my Sony. Doesn't seem to be as much space between the keys as my Sony.  Function keys are much smaller.Silence!!! This thing is so silent, if I wasn't looking at the screen, I would think it was off.  Unbelievable!  So now the question is, if this behemoth of a laptop can be so silent, then why do all my other computers sound like jets taking off and why aren't the manufacturers doing something about that!This is a gift for my son's 15th birthday, needless to say, he loves me dearly today!  He has loaded Minecraft which he said took about 30 seconds (probably exaggeration). He said it is much brighter and smoother than my old XP machine and that ancient HP I mentioned before.  He also loaded Rift (said 1 hour to download)and played that long enough to get the red eyes.  It was gorgeous (my own observation), graphics on this thing are just beautiful.  He just downloaded the trial for Rift on my Sony i7, I can't see much difference in how it runs on mine vs the ASUS, but the display is definitely much better.  Since I have no experience playing Rift, I'm waiting for him to download WoW so I can check that out.  If there is as much difference in display for WoW as for Rift and I can tell differences in the way it runs, I will definitely be considering replacing my desktop with this.", "Date": "May 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Ideal as a Desktop Replacement", "Author": "Brian F.

I have called them several times, they would keep apologizing and claim they would fix the issue, and then screw it up yet again. I have reached my limits with dealing with these people! They refuse to simply replace the unit with a new one or just refund my money, they even refuse to let me speak with a manager. I have never met people with this level of incompetence in my life!I can't get anyone at ASUS to actually do anything useful, FedEx won't re-route the package because they only let the shipper do it. So I guess I am just supposed to be out my laptop!This is the kind of service you can expect from these people. I guess that is why they have over 1000 complaints listed with the BBB over the last 3 years.", "Date": "April 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Extremely Dissapointed...", "Author": "Jimmy", "ReviewID": "R3RAGWY06MYOQF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After waiting a long time for the Asus G73SW-XA1 to become available, I finally was able to order it (after Sandy Bridge issue was resolved).  I read a lot of good reviews about this laptop and about Asus in general; overall it seemed like they had great build quality and reliability.  I also owned a few of their motherboards when I built my Desktop, so I was really looking forward in replacing my 5 1/2 year old Dell laptop.However, upon first powering the system on I got nothing but a gray screen and a bunch of lines. I tried restarting numerous times without any luck.  I couldn't easily find a phone number to call at Asus, nor did I feel like going through the whole process they would probably put me through, especially since I just got the laptop. I promptly started the return process with Amazon. Hopefully it goes smoothly and I get a full refund and shipping fees that I paid.This system seemed like an awesome deal, great specs for a great price.  Needless to say it was very disappointing that I didn't even get to use this laptop, but it's better that it failed now then later when it would be hard to get the issue resolved.  This laptop left me with a lot of doubts about the reliability of Asus now and I will probably buy a laptop of a different brand.  Even my 5 1/2 year old Dell laptop hasn't given me trouble yet and is still running strong.Good luck to anyone who already owns this laptop. Anyone considering this laptop should beware. It could have been a fluke that this laptop did not work or it could be a build issue.  As another note, I couldn't get a replacement because it became unavailable shortly after I ordered it (coincident or a sign of issues?).", "Date": "March 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Screen SO fragile, total insecurity", "Author": "ASUS user", "ReviewID": "R4Z3OO1NZXPR9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this ASUS G73J excited about its two year GLOBAL warranty and for its great reviews. However, within the first year of buying the laptop, I have had to send it in 2 times for screen repair. I am not talking about bright-dots. I am talking about TOTAL screen misfunction. It is a tempting buy because of its specs, but PLEASE do not buy this computer. For anyone who depends on it for their work, especially if they travel abroad, their global warranty is false advertising. Repairs are only available at certain centers in the US and in other limited countries, making it almost impossible for users who travel outside of those regions to get service. DO NOT BUY THIS BRAND OF COMPUTER.

Wallace \"Al\"", "ReviewID": "R3VVJ91QFVMAZ4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Here's the story on the G73JW...If fiddling with the OS is your joy, then this computer is for you. Remember when fiddling with keyboard drivers was fun...well the G73JW will not disappoint. Lost keystrokes, or a frozen keyboard, well, this is the norm, It appears that the keyboard drivers conflict with the touchpad drivers, so you need to make a choice. Which one do you REALLY want? If you turn off the touch pad, then the keyboard works fine. But if you don't, then I hope you are a one finger typist---oh and don't forget the first character you type will be ignored.Do you like crashes - well then you will be in heaven. Frozen cursors mid document are kinda fun, dontcha think? And those buggy USB 3.0 drivers are great. Copy 1 TB of files with USB 2 ports? Not with this computer. Maybe 50GB tops before a freeze-up.  But if you use your single USB 3.0 port, well a crash is only minutes away. And how about that SD card reader? It works with some 8GB cards, but ignores most of the others. But it loves 4GB cards. I guess 2^2 is cool, but 2^3 is not! And for such a powerful CPU, it is just a litle shocking that DVD's burned faster than 2X ALWAYS fail the verify. But hey, no big deal right?Turn on your wifi while ethernet is still plugged in? Oops - crash time.Battery power was touted as 2hrs 45min in the reviews. Actual battery life is less than 60 minutes! And that's in 'sleepy' CPU mode. Are you getting this?Sound drivers are awful. Mondo distortion.Oh and one more thing...Windows 7x64 by itself seems to need at least 30% of your i7 CPU at all times. So if you think this thing is fast, you are mistaken, because the OS is too busy servicing itself to have any time for applications.For those of you that are saying \"must be a hardware problem\", Linux dispelled that myth. Linux is fast and reliable on the G73, expecially Linux Mint or SuSE...except that if you let it go to sleep, say with a lid close, you can't wake it up.So how do I rate the G73JW? The answer is obvious..the G73JW is alpha, It is feature complete but untested. If you like debugging premium price hardware/software, you will be happy. For everyone else, look elsewhere.Forget the benchmarks, the G73JW belongs in the QA lab, not in consumers' hands.", "Date": "April 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Terrible Customer Service (ASUS) & defected laptop", "Author": "S", "ReviewID": "R1DCYN3YNYXMUU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "You have to wonder why they train people that no nothing about computers to help you out with your concerns. Luckily I know a thing or two about computers. I have a USB flash drive for my internet and it would not load on this laptop. The lady at customer service told me to contact my internet provider and that the software was the issue. Wrong! I went to the device manager updated the drivers and it loaded fine, however, it should have automatically loaded when put in the USB port. At least it did so on my previous HP laptop. As soon as I got this laptop there were problems, POWER SYSTEM FAILURE appeared after I backed it up and did a system image of the computer. I tried to restore to factory settings but continued to get POWER SYSTEM FAILURE.IT WAS BRAND NEW, RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX. These computers are defaulted and I suggest to never buy a laptop online. I paid an extra 23 dollars for 2 day shipping and had to send it back the next day for repairs. ASUS, shame on you, your customer service is awful and this laptop is a joke. My orignial HP g71-340US had its issues that had to be repaired, such as the heat sink fan, but never had any problems with a brand new laptop like this ASUS, how pathetic.
