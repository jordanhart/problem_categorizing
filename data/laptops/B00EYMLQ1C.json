I have had to reset this a lot and am getting frustrated with it. Small and cute, good size for my 7 year old but not recommended if you need it for work purposes.

Typing with a mouse on the keypad that pops up is not my idea of fun.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great and efficient mini-computer to take along to remote places!", "Author": "Rafael E Pena", "ReviewID": "R3P700MVSURYBK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Superb customer service by Wolvol out of Brooklyn, New York! Fast response to any questions or concern I had with this product. I purchased two units; one for me and one for my wife and we use it to travel because they are so small and nice to  pack. No problems; they work any  where there is WiFi connection.  We use wireless hotspot connection by local providers for our internet connection. We love this tiny companion! Thanks Wovol!

Your prodcut is highly recommended and your customer care is the best!", "Date": "May 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "I was very much happy", "Author": "katurcia", "ReviewID": "R9K1K1C9HYTFK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great & Excellent customer service I fell in love.
