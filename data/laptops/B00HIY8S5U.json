I ordered this, and it has the 720p screen, not the FHD, and there is no pen or digitizer support.  Amazon was fine with letting me return it for a full refund.", "Date": "March 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lenovo - horrible customer support!", "Author": "Crysti Bellamy", "ReviewID": "R31S8I8WTV8BJD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased a Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga in December; last week it just stopped working.  I had paid for the upgraded warranty, and they overnighted me a box to return it to their repair center.  I had asked for a local place in Houston to take it to and they directed me to a partner finding page on their website.  The customer care rep had no idea who to call.  After calling 3 different venders from the list and finding them all out of service, went with the overnight shipping back to the repair center.Received it back the following Friday with a note saying they replaced the motherboard and everything was tested and working correctly.  But, still did not work!  Called customer support; was advised they could ship me another box to have returned back to the repair center.  Asked to either have someone sent to the house to repair it, ship me a new computer, or refund my money.  Was put on hold so the guy could talk to his team leader.  After 15 min was sent back to the switchboard, transferred back and disconnected.  Called again, new rep was rude, could not find original info, and when asked for his name, hung up on me.  Called again, and finally got a team leader to call me back.  Said he could ask for  a one time exception to have someone come to the house, but it would have to be approved, and probably wouldn\u2019t be.  Same response for immediately shipping out a new computer, or refunding my money so I could purchase a better brand.  We need this computer for our business and this long delay is unacceptable.  So I told him to email me a shipping lable and I would immediately put it in the mail back to them, his response, we have to ship you a whole new box and label?????  I have the box I just received 2 hours ealier, just send me the label!The worst customer support I have ever received.  They should buy and apple product and call their support to learn how to operate.  I will be trying to get my money back to do just that!", "Date": "May 16, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$949.00", "Features": "Intel Core i3-4010U 1.7 GHz Processor\n4 GB DDR3 RAM\n500 GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive; 16 GB Solid-State Drive\n12.5-Inch Convertible Touchscreen Display\nWindows 8.1; 6-Hour Battery Life", "Name": "Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 12.5-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Ultrabook (20CD00BDUS) Grey", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41LYZt4EtfL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00HIY8S5U"}}
