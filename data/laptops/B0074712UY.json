because of the move to the new Intel processor, \"Ivy Bridge.\" The 2.9GHz Intel Core i7 dual-core processor just makes this MacBook Pro fly. And it runs much cooler than its predecessors. I had my laptop running while on my lap for a couple hours and the bottom case was barely warm. Fan noise was not noticeable whatsoever. To be honest, I don't even know if the fan was operating or not, it was that quiet.The aluminum  unibody case has remained pretty much unchanged for several years. In fact, my previous MacBook Pro, a 2.4GHz Intel Core 2 Duo with 4GB of RAM has the identical case that this new laptop has... it is designated as Model No: A1278 if you look at the bottom of the laptop case.What Apple threw into the mix, which made my decision of which new Apple laptop to purchase more difficult, was the addition of the Retina Display MacBook. Initially I was tormented with making the correct decision of which computer to purchase. After I weighed the differences and factored in the cost, it became clear to me that for my use, the 13\" MacBook Pro was the way to go rather than an Air or Retina Display MacBook Pro. Here are my reasons...-The Retina Display MacBook lacks an optical drive. For me, that was a critical feature as I am a Mobile DJ and still rip a lot of CD's to my computer. I did not want to have to carry around an external optical drive so having the internal optical drive on the new MacBook Pro was key.-The Retina Display MacBook does not have an Ethernet port. Again, this won't affect all people, but for me it was an essential feature that I use all the time. I wasn't ready to give up my dedicated ethernet connectivity port.-The Retina Display MacBook was priced out of my comfort zone. It's a phenomenal computer but I just could not justify the price.-The Air doesn't offer the disk space that I need nor the right combination of ports.Honestly, the display on the 13.3\" MacBook Pro is gorgeous. I can see where a photographer might enjoy the Retina Display, but for me, the 1280x800 resolution of the screen on this laptop is perfect. The display is bright, very bright, sharp and has excellent viewing from side to side. I'm a little conflicted with the glossy screen, but I think I have grudgingly accepted it for the most part. In most situations I find it nicer than a glare-free screen. For some situations however, it is not the best because of the reflections on the screen of surrounding lights and such. You must remember that while reducing glare on a screen might make it easier to view in certain situations by reducing reflections of light and surroundings, by its nature the anti-glare will reduce sharpness of the screen image. By having the glossy screen you have an amazingly bright, clear and sharp image that is just beautiful to view.I had also considered getting an early 2012 refurbished MacBook Pro. That was my second-best option. But for the small difference in price, I would not have gotten USB 3.0 ports and that was important to me, as well as getting Thunderbolt. Admittedly, there are not yet many peripherals that utilize Thunderbolt or USB 3.0 but that is certainly going to change quite rapidly. USB 3.0 is 10 times faster than USB 2.0 and offers throughput of up to 5Gbps.  Thunderbolt is even faster and allows daisy-chaining of monitors and other devices. This new MacBook Pro also has an upgraded facetime camera. It is now 720p HD and that's pretty awesome.Firewire 800 is still included on this MacBook Pro. Undoubtedly, Firewire is getting towards the end of its lifespan but many videographers are still using video cameras that use Firewire and I also have external hard drives using firewire, so this is still useful for me.The newly added Tunderbolt port is also useable as a mini-display port and you can easily obtain adapters to enable you to hook up to DVI, VAG and HDMI. I do miss not having a dedicated HDMI port, but at least it is possible to get an adapter to fill that need.The Lion and soon to be released Mountain Lion operating system has garnered a lot of comments both positive and negative. Personally I have not experienced any issues with Lion. The integration with iCloud is fantastic and allows me to keep my contacts, address book, bookmarks all in sync across all my devices (iMac, iPhone, iPod Touch and another MacBook Pro.)The iLife suite of applicatons included with the computer are excellent. iPhoto, iMovie and GarageBand are tightly integrated and work well. There is room for improvement, to be sure, but I use iPhoto and iMovie all the time and it is an amazingly capable duo.If you're considering a MacBook Pro for the first time and are coming from the PC world, welcome. You will have a little adjusting to do but it's really easy and you will probably be impressed with how straightforward the operating system is. It just works. I can't even think of when I had a crash or freeze.I've not yet reached the 7-hours mark for  battery life, but still, I've been getting at least 5 hours plus so no complaints.If you are considering the new MacBook Pro and you're already a Mac user then you will welcome the addition of a much faster processor, the addition of Thunderbolt and USB 3.0.I am really liking my new MacBook Pro and with 8GB of RAM, and the new i7 Processor running at 2.9GHZ (turbo-boost to 3.6GHz) you will be very happy with the performance.Regarding the 8GB RAM memory maximum for this MacBook Pro, it is interesting to note that Crucial sells a 16GB RAM kit for this particular model. Despite this, Apple does not acknowledge that the computer will accept 16GB of RAM. I called Apple Technical Support to ask about this and I was told that even though the computer may accept 16GB of RAM and seem to run without any problems with 16GB of RAM, the full amount of RAM may not actually be used by the MacBook Pro. It's kind of hard to say what the implications are of adding 16GB of RAM when Apple says the maximum is 8GB for this model. What will happen though is if you have any issues with the computer and Apple discovers that you've put 16GB of RAM in it, you could be denied service under the warranty. So I guess I'd be happy with 8GB of RAM until this issue gets more clarification, either by benchmark tests that show an improvement in performance or a firmware update or some acknowledgment from Apple approving the option of 16GB of RAM. I\"d like to think that if Apple wanted to make as much money as possible that they would offer this computer with an 16GB option. Since they don't, there must be a technical reason why.I've been using a protective case for my MacBook Pro and I recommend it. It's priced very fairly, comes in a variety of colors and has worked really well for me. It even lets the Apple Logo shine through the case. Here is a link to the Red color version of the case. RED iPearl mCover\u00ae Hard Shell Case for A1278 Aluminum Unibody MacBook Pro 13-inch (RED color)UPDATE: July 1, 2012 - I've been reading reports online about the fact that the new Retina Display MacBook Pro has pushed the graphics handling capabilities of the computer to the max. This has resulted in some problems that are only just beginning to manifest themselves, such as sluggish screen draw in some situations, slow frame rates in other situations and image retention issues.In other words, by pushing the limits, as Apple frequently does (and I'm not suggesting that that's a bad thing) early adopters are paying the price. So I'm feeling even better about choosing this particular model rather than spending significantly more for the Retina Display MacBook Pro and having to deal with the first generation issues.UPDATE: July 5, 2012 - Note to PC users considering the switch to a Mac. Don't be intimidated to switch. Mac OSX is a fantastic operating system and not difficult to learn at all. But there are definitely some subtle differences between the PC and Mac user interface and experience. I would strongly suggest getting a good book such as Switching to the Mac: The Missing Manual, Lion Edition. It's an excellent overview of what you'll need to know regarding the Mac experience and the Lion operating system. I use both Windows 7 and Mac OSX and own both a PC laptop and Mac laptop and desktop machines. I consider Macs to be my primary computer because of my familiarity with them and their ease of use. However, a helpful book will ease your transition and eliminate the guesswork.UPDATE: August 24, 2012 - I've upgraded my OS to Mountain Lion, 10.8, and have been running it for about 2 weeks. I have not noticed any issues and the upgrade went very smoothly. Some of the new features are great. I particularly like the dictation feature that lets you speak while in any application that accepts text input and the MBP will automatically and accurately convert your speech to text. The new way that messages are handled is very similar to IOS and I like it. Some users are reporting less battery life but I have not noticed any degradation in battery life on my comptuer.", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Loving it!", "Author": "Spencer Atherton", "ReviewID": "R3H4T4E7OE0ZDA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is not my first Mac computer, and certainly will not be my last. Before I begin, I will say that I am not like a good percentage of the people that will end up writing a review on this computer - I am not an Apple fanboy. I have owned many PC computers as well, and like them too. I currently own a Lenovo laptop as well as my new MacBook Pro, and each have their own strengths and weaknesses.To start with the strengths:1. OSX Lion is a great performer..extremely fast and reliable. I have it installed on my iMac desktop computer as well and love it. Not to mention this comes with a free upgrade to Mountain Lion, which is very nice.2. Screen looks great. Even though it is not the Retina display you can get on the 15.4 inch model, the screen is fantastic. Very bright and crystal clear with excellent color.3. Quietest laptop I have ever owned. Keeps quiet even when the computer is under a heavy load.4. First computer I have owned with USB 3.0. I bought an external hard drive when I purchased this laptop as well so I could utilize the USB 3.0. I got the hard drive yesterday and transferred all of my files from my old laptop to the new hard drive so I could put them on my MacBook. It took about 1/5th of the time it did with USB 2.0.5. My Lenovo laptop does not have an illuminated keyboard, so the keyboard on this laptop is a big plus in my opinion. Excellent for people that like to work or surf the web while their significant other is sleeping.6. The trackpad - can't even compare it to any trackpad I have seen on any other laptop computer.7. Excellent battery life while being a very fast performer. It definitely has the best of both worlds. I average about 6 hours on a charge. My Lenovo (with similar graphics, processor, etc. and same use) only lasts about 4 or 5 hours on a full charge.8. Typical Apple simplistic styling. I love the look of the Apple products. Simple and clean.9. Many, many more...but those are the most notable ones to me.Now, for the weaknesses.1. The only thing I dislike about this laptop are the rubber pads found on the bottom of the computer for grip. They may get softer and more sticky as time goes by, but right now they are far from that. The pads on the bottom of my Lenovo are definitely much better and don't allow the computer to slide around while I am using the computer on a glass topped desk.2. Price - it's a bit pricey for the performance you get, but the added perks of Mac OSX and the durability and support of Apple products makes up for it. For the same price, you can get a PC with more memory, larger hard drive, better graphics, and a faster processor, but then you remember you're running Windows 7, which isn't nearly as well built as Mac OSX.In conclusion - this is a great laptop. Although it is a little pricey, it is well worth the extra money. So far, the only issue I have with it (rubber pads) is a very small problem that does not change how this laptop performs in any way.If you are thinking about getting a MacBook Pro laptop but do not want to spend a huge amount of money for one, this is definitely the way to go. It may be considered the \"base model\" MacBook Pro, but it still an excellent computer. The size and battery life of this computer makes it excellent for people that need a laptop that is very mobile. Between work and college classes, I needed a lightweight yet durable computer and this definitely fits that criteria.9.5/10", "Date": "June 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "macbook air 13inch vs macbook pro 13inch", "Author": "intrimitido", "ReviewID": "RVJ43DY1SH9JK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this review is about my personal honest experience, i am not a computer wizard.like most of you, i had a hard time thinking which one to buy, an air or a pro. what i did is purchased the two and see which one will better suit my needs and send back the one that I won't like. so I went at my local best buy and did so. after using both products for 14days, here are my thoughts.the macbook air looks very beautiful on the outside. it's so thin and light and can be used anywhere like a tablet. to sum things up, the MB air is more of a fashion statement than a work horse. is it faster than a pro? yes only by 10-15secs during start up. the audio quality sounds thin but loud. the pro has a deeper sound. air has higher resolution but the fonts are small. what I hate about it is the screen display color. macbook pro by far has more vivid colors and if you love to watch netflix and hd videos like me, the pro is a better choice. i like the design of the air but i'm sorry to say that it is more like a toy than a real life laptop. if you have a main computer, the air is a very good addition but if you only need an all in one computer like me to take with you, store data, watch videos, do picture and video editing and plan to use for a very long time, then the macbook pro is a better choice and for me is more sturdy. one reviewer says that the air has better screen display but I don't agree with that because i am an amateur photographer and im pretty sure i know which has the better display. in the long run you will be needing that dvd drive, the storage and ram that you can customize, the ethernet and ports that are already built in and most of all the screen display. the macbook pro still looks stunningly beautiful and is a more capable laptop. even the keyboard is better to type on. the air is super light weight but the pro still is light. we still need to use our muscles sometimes. battery life are identical 5-6 hrs.I got more from my money on the pro and it is a better choice for me that's why I kept it and sent the air back for a refund. again this is just my personal honest opinion.", "Date": "March 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Surprisingly unimpressive compared with new MacBook Air", "Author": "Farb Dannon", "ReviewID": "R2688UMHBW3YHE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased the newly updated 13\" MacBook Pro and the newly updated 13\" MacBook Air the day they were announced at WWDC and released for sale in June 2012. (My 13\" MacBook Pro is the 2.9 GHz i7 model, and my MacBook Air is factory upgraded to a 2.0 GHz i7 processor and 8GB RAM.)After using the two machines side-by-side for a couple weeks now, I can say that the MacBook Air outperforms the MacBook Pro in almost every task and in terms of overall speed and performance. Compared with the newly refreshed and updated Air, the new MacBook Pro is frankly a significant disappointment, and I've pretty much stopped using it altogether in favor of the faster Air. Despite the Air's slower CPU clock speed, it performs faster than the Pro in actual tasks due to the performance boost afforded by it's SSD hard drive. The SSD drive on the MacBook Air makes an enormous difference in everything from casual web browsing to video editing.If you're debating which 13\" MacBook to buy, the 13\" MacBook Air or the 13\" MacBook Pro, here's a side-by-side comparison...Speed and Performance: Advantage MacBook AirApart from the hard drives and port configurations, the technology inside the machines is virtually identical in both the newly refreshed MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. Both Pros and Airs come with either i5 or i7 Intel \"Ivy Bridge\" processors, Intel HD Graphics 4000, USB 3.0, and lightning-fast Thunderbolt ports. While the MacBook Air models are at a disadvantage to the MacBook Pro models in terms of CPU clock speeds, any performance disadvantage from the processor speed is more than made up for by the lightning fast performance of the Air's SSD hard drive, which Apple markets as \"Flash\" storage. In everyday tasks from gaming to web browsing to watching Flash movies and editing video, the MacBook Air is faster significantly faster in virtually every task. The Air boots up in less than 12 seconds while the Pro takes upwards of one minute.Screen: Advantage MacBook AirIf you've never used a MacBook Air, much less the new Retina display 15\" MacBook Pro, then you won't notice just how outdated the MacBook pro's screen is. However, once you get used to the super high resolution 1440 x 900 LED display on the MacBook Air, the 1280 x 800 back-lit LED display on the MacBook Pro looks downright grainy and primitive. Simply put, once you get used to a higher resolution display, the 1280 x 800 display on the 13\" MacBook Pro just isn't acceptable. Even for simple tasks like email or word processing where you wouldn't think the resolution would matter, the graphics look grainy and pixelated, which just isn't acceptable for a pro-level laptop in 2012.Upgradability: Advantage MacBook ProThe Pro's only major advantage over the Air comes in terms of the flexibility of its hardware, ease of repair, and upgradability. With only a screw driver and about 10 minutes of your time, you can add more memory to the Pro, replace the hard drive, and even add a second hard drive in place of the optical disc drive. The Air, on the other hand, is stuck in the configuration you purchase it in except that you can opt to replace the SSD \"Flash\" hard drive with a higher capacity SSD drive.Design, Weight, Portability, Battery Life, and Form Factor: Advantage MacBook AirThe MacBook Air is the most beautiful computer ever produced by man, and the MacBook Pro looks like it's older, pudgy relative. The Air's aluminum case is impeccably designed, almost tailored to accommodate the necessary internal components, while maintaining practical ergonomics. It's an incredibly thin, svelte, sexy little notebook. The MacBook Air's aluminum case seems sturdy and durable, and its mechanics are very similar to the time-test unibody construction of the MacBook Pro. The MacBook Pro, on the other hand, is a bit of a dinosaur in its bulky circa 2006 unibody. The Pro is heavier than a half gallon of milk at 4.5 lbs, while the MacBook Air weighs in at less than 2.9 lbs. Battery life is roughly even on both machines at anywhere from 4 to 7 hours depending on workload and settings.Summary Judgement: Buy the MacBook Air (or opt for the new 15\" Retina display MacBook Pro)Simply put, the guts of the MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro are basically the same, but the Air's SSD hard drive gives it a tremendously significant boost in performance. Sadly, the MacBook Pro's 5400-rpm hard drive leaves the machine unable to capitalize on the newest, most expensive Intel \"Ivy Bridge\" i5 and i7 processors that you're paying a $300 premium for in the newly updated Pros. If you are going to buy a Pro, invest the extra money and get it upgraded with a SSD hard drive and get an extra external hard drive if you need additional cheap storage space for multimedia files. When you also consider the superior display, lighter weight, increased portability, and lower price of the MacBook Air, it's hard to find a reason to justify purchasing the current 13\" MacBook Pro, which to me looks like a dinosaur rapidly headed for extinction.Specs on the models compared:13\" MacBook Air (mid 2012) factory upgraded to the 2.0 GHz dual core i7 processor and factory upgraded to 8 GB RAM (1600MHz DDR3L SDRAM) with standard 256 GB SSD (\"Flash\") hard drive13\" MacBook Pro (mid 2012) with 2.9 GHz dual core i7 processor, 8 GB RAM (1600MHz DDR3L SDRAM), and 750GB Serial ATA Drive @ 5400 rpmBoth feature Intel HD 4000 Graphics, 3.0 USB, Thunderbolt, 802.11n, etc.", "Date": "June 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Simply the best computer I've ever used... with one possibly irrelevant issue", "Author": "Elizabeth A. Schauble \"Azunai\"", "ReviewID": "R3BX8E2I17GA4P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used to be a die hard windows fan. I was always bashing OSx for the usual things (too expensive, too dumb, et cetera, et cetera), and I never really gave it a chance. Windows 7 was my OS of choice from the day it came out, and I used it on many different computers with (or at least what I thought then) good results. It's certainly not a bad OS but...This past holiday season, I got an Asus tablet PC. I wanted to love it, I really did. I gave it a five star review here on Amazon, and I tried my very hardest to use it to it's fullest potential. It was working fine for a while, until I tried the Windows 8 beta. It was all down-hill from there. Viruses, problems (beyond those that should be in a beta, and a general ugliness drove me absolutely insane, and I decided to move away from Windows, at least temporarily. I bought a Chromebook, and while I absolutely love it and highly recommend it, I wanted more out a computer than it offered.So, nearly on a whim, I bought a Mac. I have never made a better tech decision. Literally everything about it is better than any computer I've ever used, from the operating system to the hardware.People typically say that the real reason they love Macs and other Apple products is because of the build quality. While the build quality on this computer is INSANELY good (I feel bad hauling it around with me; I feel like it should be in an art museum), I really think it's the software that makes this a standout computer and computing experience. I've had absolutely zero backround in OSx up until now, and already I am easily finding my way around this computer. Granted, I've had a good backround in Linux and OSx is similar, but the fact that I'm easily navigating a brand new operating system after only one day is quite the contrast from Windows, now that I can look at it objectively. OSx Lion is wonderful. The multi-touch gestures and the multi-touch mouse itself are immensely helpful, and it's because of features like these that make it clear to me that it's almost necessary for a company to make the hardware for a product if they're making the software as well. Everything works extremely well together.Like I said, the included apps put Windows to shame. With the exception of Outlook (which I personally hate, but my Mom has a Mac and can't stand the contacts App and uses Outlook), I can't think of a single, rational person who would pick Windows software over Apple software when it comes to things like media, photo/video editing, and email. To be perfectly honest, it's ridiculous how well all this stuff works. I downloaded the iWorks office suite (which is not free, though significantly cheaper than Microsoft Office), and they also work like a charm. I really don't create a whole lot of spreadsheets or slide shows so I can't guarantee a qualified opinion on Numbers (Excel) or Keynote (PowerPoint), but the Pages app is lightyears ahead of Microsoft Word. I also downloaded Logic Pro 9 (an music synthesizer/recording studio app) after having used it with friends a few months back, and have spent hours digging into another fantastic piece of Mac Software, and I can say for a fact that it is truly unparalleled in the Windows world.The actual hardware internals of the computer are amazing. The new Ivy Bridge processors whip through anything I can throw at them, and the 8 gb of fast (1600 mhz) ram makes multi-tasking a breeze. The nVidia graphics card, while not a show-stopper, is completely adequate for some heavy-duty video editing in something like Final Cut or Photo Shop (though I haven't used Photo Shop in about a year now, so I'm not COMPLETELY sure about the latter of the two statements), or gaming (whether you dual-boot or pick one of the games from the increasingly impressive OSx catalogue). The speakers, while not mind-blowing, are much better than what I'm used to from integrated laptop speakers, and the screen, even though I opted for the non-HD screen, is very good; colors are bright and saturated, the pixel density is more than satisfactory, and the viewing angles are some of the best I've ever seen. Battery life is as good as advertised, and the computer starts and runs much more quickly than I'm used to, especially considering that this computer doesn't have flash storage.I haven't run into a single thing I would change about this computer up to this point. I love the software, I love the hardware, and I love my decision. If you're in the market for an exceptional, powerful notebook, look no further. I can't recommend this computer highly enough.Edit: While the great things that I mentioned about OSx are all still completely viable and even after several weeks (months, perhaps?) of heavy usage I haven't experienced any problems. Mountain Lion is a great update and even though I don't own an iPhone or an iPad (I'm more of an android guy), I still like almost all of the additions it brings to OSx.However, I have since installed Windows. Bootcamp is a marvelous program, and in about 20 minutes I had Windows 7 working great on my computer. All the drivers were installed and performance was great. Once I actually started playing games though, several design flaw were suddenly extremely apparent to me, and they were apparent in a very bad way.I'm not sure if Windows is just a more demanding operating system or if a fan driver was left out of my Bootcamp install, but the cooling of this computer when doing ANYTHING intensive under Windows is absolutely atrocious. The unibody design is gorgeous. It's revolutionary, it's stylish, it's classy, and it has major practical issues. The vents are hidden under the hinges of the screen, and anything but the most perfect of screen angles will block off much of the fans output. Even with the fans blowing full blast at nearly all times while running Windows, the computer gets extremely hot during usage. I use a laptop as a literal \"lap\" top computer frequently. This works fine under OSx; it's impossible under Windows. The bottom of the computer gets painfully hot during heavy usage (to the point where I literally can't touch it for more than a few seconds), and the metal area (ironically) around the \"wasd\" keys gets extremely hot as well. I've had the computer completely overheat three times only in the past two weeks. Since I only play online games, this isn't a real issue, but I can't imagine what would happen were someone actually doing something important on a Windows partition and have the computer overheat and shut down. Even with good ventilation (meaning smooth granite surfaces and a laptop stand specifically designed to enhance ventilation), there is no avoiding an extremely hot computer and constantly whirring fans.Long story short, I'm very glad they improved the fan design in the Retina Display Macbooks, because it is, frankly, very, very poor here.I'm conflicted on whether I should change my overall rating of the computer though. Even though Macs are equipped (through Bootcamp) to run Windows, they weren't designed to do so, and I certainly haven't had a single issue while running (the far superior) OSx. Considering the fact that I should be basing my opinion of the product on its own merits and not on those of a competing product, I don't think I will change my overall scoring. I do think it is prudent to add, however, that cooling while running Windows 7 is terrible. If you NEED Windows, stick with a Windows computer. They will most likely handle Windows better than this one will.", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Used item being sold as new", "Author": "sinclairvoyant", "ReviewID": "R2XQ1JNF39YUKH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I just want to issue a warning to people who purchase this product trying to save a bit over Apple prices.

Let me start off by saying that I was highly reluctant to spend so much money on a laptop. I've always been a Windows guy so I've known that you can buy laptops with equivalent specs to Macs for a good deal cheaper. Though after comparing different laptops I was not able to find one that had  a satisfactory build quality. The closest I could find were laptops made by Asus, but even then I read of too many build quality issues that made me uneasy. Ultrabooks made by other companies had good quality, but by then they cost just as much as the MacBook but with lower specs.  So I decided to take the plunge with this MacBook after demoing it in a Apple Store. Here are the things that made me confident with my purchase:Build Quality - Seriously, you can't beat a unibody construction. While other laptops creak when you pick them up due to the various plastic components screwed together, the Macbook feels firm. The only thing that initially concerned me was that the lid would slightly creak when you closed it. Running waxed dental floss through the hinges solved this.Trackpad and Keyboard- This extra large trackpad is heavenly to use. Having the whole trackpad function as a giant button is a lot more comfortable to use. Plus two finger clicking as a replacement for the right click button is surprisingly intuitive. The keyboard keys are well spaced and the led backlighting is very cool.Power System - I regularly get around 6 hours from the battery, which I am more than satisfied with. The magsafe plugin system is more handy than I thought it would be, and there is a neat led battery indicator on the side of the notebook that makes checking the battery level with the computer off easy.OS X - Mine initially came with Lion, but after upgrading to Mountain Lion I am even more satisfied. Everything runs fast and animations are fluid. I love the multi touch features, which again is something I initially didn't think I would really need. It took me a little time to get used to using finder after being accustomed to windows explorer, but I am confident now in my ability to navigate through files just as quickly as in Windows.Dual Booting - I have a few engineering programs that only run on Windows so I decided to install Windows 7 through bootcamp.  Because it boots natively from the hard drive, it runs just as smoothly as any other Windows laptop. Remember folks, this computer doesn't have any magical internal components. The Intel Chipset is the same used in any other laptop and thus Windows runs just the same with the proper drivers installed.Chipset - The Intel Core i5 runs very fast with minimal heat. The Intel Graphics 4000 is more than adequate for most applications.I could even run Portal 2 on maximum graphics settings and play 1080p video without it breaking a sweat. The fan almost never revs up to an audible level. This is in part to the aluminum body being a giant heat sink. So yes, the laptop body can get warm at times. But it is never uncomfortably warm when I use it on my lap. Ill probably upgrade the RAM and the harddrive to an SSD in the future, but for now they are fine.So all in all I am very happy with my purchase. I am officially a Mac convert and will use this laptop for a very long time.Also, all the Windows \"gamers\" who are trashing Macs need to gain some perspective. Yes, I can get a Core i7 laptop with a dedicated graphics card for a lot cheaper than the MacBook. But I decided to spend the extra money to get a better engineered laptop with some nifty extra features.", "Date": "July 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "DON'T BUY THIS, IT'S NOT A NEW ITEM!

Added an iMac about 2 years later. Then, switched back to primarily PC for work on a HP Envy 14. I also took some time to build a sweet gaming PC rig. And now, after selling the iMac (not really used since college), the gaming PC and the HP Envy 14, I have hopped back onto this MacBook Pro 13 inch.I'm very glad to be back on an Apple product. Having used PCs exclusively for the last 2 years, I can identify a few specific reasons why I wanted to get back to Mac.1) Mouse mechanics - there is really nothing in the PC market that compares to the Mac trackpad. The closest alternative to its smooth, accurate and conveniently place functionality is the Lenovo ThinkPad's red nipple. Since I work often where having to pull out a separate mouse would be inconvenient, this was an important point for me.2) Battery life - even new, the HP Envy only hits 3 hours or so on a full charge. I can squeeze close to 6 hours out of the MBP. Trips on the road make the doubled battery life very useful.3) Lion productivity features - I remember having to use a second monitor on my PC setups just for the real estate. i can honestly say that I am fine without that now when able to swipe between desktops with 3 finger motions on this trackpad. Having a second monitor anyway is a bonus now that lets me just keep iTunes or Outlook open on the side.4) Speed - Lion and the upgrades I've added to this MBP (listed above) have made this computer incredibly fast. I can crunch through 500,000 row Excel spreadsheets, update my iPhone firmware, and watch a 720p YouTube without any noticeable hitches. Startup takes less than 10 seconds, waking from start is instantaneous (so awesome and useful!), install speeds are zippy.5) Prettiness - beautiful work machines can inspire better and more creative work. It does more than just make me want to use the MBP more - it's a constant reminder of how careful planning, bold design choices, good engineering, and hard work make inspirational products.Clearly I'm a fan. Still, I'm going to deduct a star for three reasons:1) Price - it's expensive for the components inside. The price essentially values the Lion OS X and integrated software/hardware at something like $200 over similar Windows systems.2) Fragile aesthetics - the aluminum frame scratches a little too easily and the glossy screen picks up fingerprints/oil. I'm babying the hell out of this MBP, which means taking off my aircraft aluminum watch before using it and wiping its screen down about once every other day.3) Glossy screen - screen glare makes working in sunlight basically impossible.", "Date": "July 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Counterfiet product", "Author": "MARIANO MUSSI", "ReviewID": "RC3RCV89ECK1V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was dissapointed by Amazon.

But Apple does not pretend it has any of these. What it does have is great reliability on the software side and hardware side, Apple's OSX Mountain Lion, the sleek looks Apple always delivers, reasonable specs, good battery life, nice keyboard, and excellent trackpad.Now, the question is, who is this computer for? Those looking for a bargain laptop will shy away from the enormous price tag, and those who want to play the latest games do not ever use Macs. The average computer user will be served better by a Macbook Air, since it is faster (for basic tasks), lighter, and has a higher-res antiglare screen. The MacBook Pro 13.3 inch laptop is for those who want to use a Mac, but value performance and upgradability over weight and screen resolution. This Mac will last longer than any other simply because it is the easiest to upgrade and repair. Hard drives can be replaced, RAM can be added as needed, and the internal battery can be replaced after losing its ability to hold a charge. The processor is roughly 15% faster than the one inside the Macbook Air, which also extends this computer's usable lifespan.The fact that the screen is fairly low-res for the price (MBP 13 has a res of 1280x800, while other windows laptops have a res of 1600x900 for the same price), really detracts from my personal experience with the computer. The retina display of my iPhone 5 has indeed spoiled me, and Apple should update the screen of the MBP 13 or bring down the price of the retina model. This, added with the fact that the speed of the hard drive is very slow for the money, detracts from the computer's value. Lowering the price by one hundred dollars would justify the hard drive and screen and make the computer a five-star purchase, but for the price, this is a four star (good) computer. Those looking to drop $1200 on a new laptop will have to decide if the upgradability and processor performance is worth the money over the sleeker MacBook Air. In addition, if Mac OSX is not something you enjoy using, then I would advise that you look elsewhere for a laptop.TLDR version: good, reliable laptop with mediocre screen and slow hard drive.", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great computer for both consumers and professionals.", "Author": "Alexis Carstens", "ReviewID": "R2UXSK9XZZVA6W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my MacBook Pro 13\" two weeks and I'm amazed by how good this machine is. I was having a though time deciding between the 13\" MacBook Air or the MacBook Pro 13\" (Both baseline models, priced at 1,200 $ retail) I went for the MacBook pro because I needed lots of storage and 128gb on the MacBook Air are just not enough for me and even if I had bought the MacBook Air it would had defeated the purpose of the Air since it wouldn't be so \"portable\" if I had to take an external Hard drive everywhere with me.  So... Pros and Cons:Pros:Speed: This MacBook pro is fast, really fast, it boots up in around 30 seconds, apps open quickly and the MacBook doesn't lag when it comes to video editing, and Photoshop also runs decently. Design: The computer has a great design, its not that thick, it has all the necessary ports, even a battery indicator which I think is awesome, it also has USB 3 which is really nice and fastKeyboard: The keyboard is amazing, the keys are sensitive and it feels amazing to type on them, the keyboard is backlit, which is perfect for typing in low lights situations.Trackpad: The glass trackpad is really nice, its big, the entire trackpad is a button and the gestures are really nice. Simply the best trackpad I've used.Battery: Battery life is pretty good, I get around 5-6 hours doing normal tasks.OS X: This is my first mac and I'm impressed by OS X Mountain Lion, it comes with no 3th party software, it comes with all the apps you need + the Mac App Store is great for finding new apps. The OS is fast and fluid, everything is organized and it's just beautiful. I'm coming from Windows 7 and the switch was quite easy for me.Cons:Screen: I think 1280-by-800 is quite low for a computer this expensive and that its claimed to be a professional notebook, even the 13\" MacBook air has a better display. Don't get me wrong, the display is not that bad looking, in fact its quite good, but for something this expensive it will be nice if it came with a better screen.Overall this is a great computer, its fast, has a great design, big storage (Even though it's a bit slow, but I'm planning on upgrading to a SSD soon) and awesome battery life. I will recommend this MacBook to anyone looking for a good portable notebook.One more thing, Windows users don't let OS X stop you from switching, the first days it's a bit hard to get used to it but after you will love Mountain Lion, and if you need any specific windows application that wont run in OS X there's plenty of ways of getting Windows 7 in a Macintosh", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Apple: they make a mean Laptop", "Author": "LinuxMan03 \"Jib\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZR97RDBP0C7N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Years ago I only use XP, but the debacle with Vista left me looking for a new OS.  I turned to Linux distributions.  Ubuntu, Mint, and many others offer a great variety of OS to fit my needs.  After years of doing that, I tried my first Mac.  So, here's an aging geek's take on the Mac.Getting accustomed:The first time you start a Mac it take a few minutes to understand the gestures.  What makes all the screens visible, shifts from one workspace to another, and scrolling a page.  Within a few hours I was using the gestures unconsciously.  I found my experience was not atypical when a friend bought her first Mac and was able to make the gestures a habit within a day of on and off use.Browsing files and starting programs is a little different that windows, but it's easy to figure out.  To browse local files, use the Finder and to find a program, use the Launchpad.Compared to Windows 8, figuring out how to use a Mac is a walk in the park.  I have a Win8 machine gathering dust because of this laptop.Hardware:I built many computers.  Most of then are 4+ cores and built for speed.  Apple hardware is not the newest, but it's rock solid.  They make products that work!  Everything is fluid and intuitive- something that can't be said about Win8.Software:Like it's hardware, these Macbooks have well tuned software that simply works.  For those who need to use a Windows program, a program called Parallels works very well to run those programs on a Mac.Price:Yes, you pay a premium for this kind of hardware and software.  Is it worth it?  If you are looking for a long term, everyday laptop- the Macbook is an ideal choice.  If you need something that will get trashed (going on deployment, you tend to drop your laptop, ect) or you just need something short term, maybe an investment in a laptop isn't best.  For some people, a tablet is a better choice.  Samsung makes the Note 10.1 and 8 which read handwriting very well.  Choose hardware that will fit your life.Overall:Great product for home and/or business users that need a full laptop.  Instead of buying a low cost laptop every 2-3 years, get a Mac which will last you 10 years.Note:Please take care of your battery, no matter what laptop/tablet you have.

Can't do that with a retina.- with bootcamp you get the best of both worlds OS 10 and windows.- great for gaming I've been running Far Cry 3 and Fallout New Vegas and it has plenty of power to spare.My criticisms- I really can't think of any. I wish apple would add a touch screen that would make this the perfect laptop.The bottom lineIf your looking for a mobile powerhouse that is user upgradeable, and the quality that can only come from apple this is the computer for you. This is still the real MacBook Pro in my opinion. If you want a design that is tried and true and don't want to spend your life savings on a maxed out retina model (because you can't upgrade them) still like having a DVD  drive and other practical ports give this one serious consideration.", "Date": "February 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Screen started flickering and freeze after just 4 months.", "Author": "Naresh", "ReviewID": "R13XM70HQUF8WF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am writing this review after using it for around 6 months.

After learning from many who use macs, and the software that's offered, I caught a real bad case of the Joneses and purchased one of these bad boys that I had never gave much thought to in the past. I was so convinced I would love it, I bought 8 gigs of Crucial ram and a geeky toolkit to install it with (which worked very well). Sadly, I just don't get it. Well, I kind of do, but I did not fall in love with it like planned.PROS:1. Everything, and I mean, everything, looks beautiful. Not just the aesthetics, but every single piece of software looks great. OS X designers are light years ahead of Windows, I am 100% convinced of that.2. The App store is amazing, and full of useful software to help with any task you need to perform, especially with Design. This is the #1 reason I wanted to switch to Mac, because of all the wonderful apps that are available that function AND look amazing.3. The trackpad is bananas. I never used my laptops mousepad, because it sucked. The Mac's mousepad is genius.4. The power cord confused the heck out of me at first, but once I figured it out I was very impressed. And the way it connects by a magnet is the coolest thing I have seen in a long time on a computer.5. Expose, Spaces, and Hot corners are genius. Whoever is responsible for those deserves to retire young and be set for life.Cons:I can safely say that most of these cons are opinion and preference based. So please don't take offense if you don't agree.1. Price. I am not fully convinced the high cost is worth it.2. Performance. The performance was fine, but it didn't blow me away like some people who I talked to tried to convince me it would :) Boot up was pretty slow, a lot slower than my 3 year old Vaio running Windows 8. In fact, they pretty much run at the same speeds. But the Mac is a little faster than my Vaio when it is running Windows 7.3. Display. The glossy screen ruined it for me. As I mentioned, I do design work, so any time I try and make something with a Dark background, the screen literally turns into a mirror. I couldn't believe it, and would not recommend a glossy screen to anyone who is going to be working on dark backgrounds, or under any kind of bright lighting. Even in lower lighting, I could still see myself more than I wanted to.4. Only 2 usb ports...seems kind of...limited.5. The dock and global menu are horrible compared to the rest of the features of OS X.Unfortunately, I am returning this. I do give it 4 stars though because it truly is a great computer, but at the same time, currently, not the computer for me.

I own an iPhone, iPad and Apple TV, and long ago my first computer was an Apple II+ and I loved using the old Macintoshes in the 80s. So, I'm partial to Apple. Their products, including the MBP, are beautiful, sleek and clever. I haven't had an Apple computer in a long time.However, other than its graphics capability, this Apple computer and apparently its brethren are not ready for real work in the professional world. Apple remains a novelty item mostly living on its own island, preferring to interact with its own tribe on its own terms. I spent $5,000 on the best version of this machine available and peripherals, so I could switch from a PC. After two months of trying to make it do the things my PC laptop did, I'm about to ditch it all and buy another PC. I don't do this lightly. I've put many hours in to trying to make this work.Among the reasons:1. My printer won't work with this so I bought a new printer.2. My scanner won't work with this so I spent $150 for special software inferior to the original.3. My professional software doesn't work on Apple so I run those programs through Parallels. That makes them so very slow, more complicated, and less usable.4. The Word processing program is a more limited accommodation of the Apple system. Same for Excel, etc.5. The mail program is inadequate for managing a lot of email from multiple sources.6. The keyboard is awful and makes it a chore to navigate around a document. People who do a lot of work fast need to move around a document. We need buttons for going to the beginning and end of a document, page up and page down, and so forth. On an Apple these and other functions are either missing, hard to use, or you have to use multiple keystrokes to do them as a work-around.7. The Apple engineers have not yet discovered the delete key. Again, you have to do a work-around to delete, rather than just push a button.8. Also, the engineers at Apple don't think people use faxes anymore. Please note Apple: The world still uses faxes and you don't. It took me extra time and money to buy an external modem that would work with a Macbook, and to set it up specially with this OS. Then I learned that I can't fax out of the Mac using my professional cover page. Their cover page is nothing more than a few words on a blank piece of paper and of course looks like it was done by a 10-year-old. Again, Apple is not ready for the professional world, it's a novelty. My PC does this very easily and it looks good. I had to work around this through Windows run through Parallels. Therefore, I also had to install another version of Word through Parallels to handle the documents to be faxed. More work-arounds that are clunky, slow, and bothersome.Peripherals are very pretty, and not very functional.1. The Thunderbolt display is magnificently beautiful but rigidly low in functioning. It doesn't turn, bend, or look up and down. You do it their way or not at all. And it only talks with certain macs and never, ever anything else. You fit to the display, it doesn't try to fit to your needs. My Dell display fits what I need physically and electronically.2. The external keyboard I bought is cute and useless for hard work. It belongs in a dollhouse or the hands of a teenager writing emails and tweets. A waste of money. I bought a better one from another company.3. The magic mouse is the same ... cute and clever, but not ready for someone who needs to use the computer to write, edit, move documents, scroll around and navigate through web pages often. A waste of money. I bought a better one from another company.4. The Time Capsule I bought has great wifi and it works wonderfully with a Mac. However, not so much with anything else. It's dropped my PC on the wifi net so I can't use it to store or transfer data, which it still communicates very well with the Mac. So now the work-around is to move information back and forth with an HDD or flash drive. Ridiculous, I know. But I can't use the Mac to do the things the PC did for me so I have to have one foot in each system, still trying to make the MBP work.I spent a lot of time at the Apple store using my $99 one-to-one service being told \"No, you can't do that on a Mac.\" One-to-One service had its problems:Like the Apple products, the staff at the store was also attractive, smiling, rigid and unaccommodating. You do it their way or the highway. I do my professional work every day out of my laptop. The service included transferring all my data to the Mac, but they wanted me to leave it with them for three days even though the actual work would take far less time. Losing the machine for three days would be very hard. I had a three and a half day span in which I didn't have appointments so I could give it up for a day. I called them beforehand to ask if we could work together to get it done in one day. The woman didn't want to discuss it or hand me over to a manager. She told me to drive to the store to talk about it.I drove to the store that night after work and met with another employee, explaining I'd accommodate them any way they want as long as I just leave it for a day. She didn't turn me over to a manger. She told me to come back the next day to have it done as a one-to-one session. I came back the next day where the employee said he couldn't do this because he wasn't told it was a PC-to-Mac and he doesn't do that. He went back and forth to someone in charge, but wouldn't let me speak with anyone who could work with me. So he reiterated that the only way to do this was to leave it with them for three days, acknowledging that almost all that time it would be sitting on a shelf. I said no thanks.So the bottom line is that1. The MBP is beautiful has many wonderful capabilities.2. However, you have to adjust yourself to what it will do, not what you want it to do. It does much less than what PC's do.3. It works extremely well with other Apple products. The synchronization between the MBP and my Apple TV, iPhone and iPad is amazing and easy.4. It does not work well with any other systems or products.5. It is not ready for many forms of professional use.Right now I'm in a quandary. I've spent a lot of money and massive amounts of time trying to make this into a professional's machine. Instead, it is becoming a toy I use for limited purposes in the field, bringing information back to the PC system to be managed, communicated and stored.

I wanted the familiar  Windows OS with the hardware the MBP had to offer, but initially ran into a few problems. I'll post the problems and their solutions that I discovered in case anyone else runs into similar problems.1. After installing the drivers for Windows, my webcam didn't work. It said that the drivers were not installed yet even after I downloaded the most recent driver package from Apple. Solution: it turned out to be pretty simple. My previous laptop had software preinstalled that controlled the webcam and added effects to it, and I erroneously thought that since my MBP didnt have this program that the webcam wasn't working. After installing the drivers my webcam actually worked fine with Facebook chat.2. The MBP got REALLY hot when running windows 7. This couldnt be good for the computer components, but also posed a fire risk.Solution: while on windows I installed a program called MacFan (just google it) that after typing in a few commands in the command prompt allowed me to turn up the fan speed indefinitely to significantly cool off the laptop. While in windows the fans aren't correctly utilized according to CPU usage so you'll have to do this process upon each startup. Just search on YouTube \"how to install macfan\" for thorough instructions.3. Videos on youtube while in windows do not expand fully to the screen, instead leaving black bars on the bottom and right sides. Still haven't solved this. I'd expect adjusting the screen resolution would have an effect but I haven't tried this yet.4. The battery life decreased from 7 hours to about 2.5 hours while on Windows.This couldn't be solved either. It's just how windows works on the Mac. The only solution is to turn the brightness down, etc.5. When I click an icon on the taskbar, its title flashes over it. (not the biggest deal but its annoying) Updated my Nvidia drivers from their website and it solved minor graphics problems.As for my actual review of the MacBook Pro, I am very satisfied. I run both windows 7 and mountain lion on it through bootcamp (helpful detailed instructions can be found on YouTube). That way I have the ability to run all my old games and programs on windows while having the Mac side to use for top notch picture and video editing, plus the App Store. I've always preferred the relative simplicity of Microsoft office 2007 for windows, so I use that.After adjusting trackpad and click settings on the windows side, navigation is easy and fluid. The separated keyboard buttons took some adjusting to but that's not any issue. The screen is bright, clear, and rich while the backlit keyboard helps for typing in dark environments.It's about 2 pounds lighter than my previous laptop and significantly thinner, and what I'd consider to be portable. Ill be using it at college next year and will report back on just how portable it is.Graphics, processing, and RAM are all lightning fast and should be useful in intensive software that ill be using. The only problem I've noticed is that after partitioning the hard drive, startup takes a little longer (around 22 seconds total).The power cord is portable and extendable, while its nice to still have the optical drive, Ethernet port, and card slot. Only having 2 USB ports so close in proximity is a minor issue with larger thumb drives, etc. but I may just purchase a separate hub.All in all, you won't regret buying this.

Kavuri", "ReviewID": "R1KWV88UFXTQ4N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have already posted a similar review for the MBP old version, I am posting the same review here again since my review concentrates on the user interface of OS X. (not too sure whether I am allowed to do post the same review but just thought it could help some people before they switch to OS X)I have been a Windows user since I started using a computer and I never used a Mac OS X till I actually bought the MBP in 2011. So, this review would really help someone who is considering a Mac for the first time and wants to use it either at school or to remotely connect to work. This article summarizes what you would love and what you could be missing.I previously owned a desktop, a HP laptop and a Compaq laptop before I bought a MBP. Also, I still use Windows machine at work. One of the major reasons I bought the MBP was because it was available on a eBay deal from Macmall for $950. I assumed that if I did not like it, I could always sell it for at least $850 on eBay or Craigslist.Before reading the next part, please do understand that MBP and OS X come together. Things you need to know --**OS XSwitching between applications - This is one of my biggest quirks with OS X. Windows 7 does an awesome job in switching between applications. When you want to switch between the applications, you use ALT+TAB in Windows 7 and this would shift the focus to the next application. If the application is minimized in OS X, you can switch between applications by using CMD+TAB but it does not automatically bring up the other application, it just changes the active application in menu bar. I never understood the reasoning behind this, why would I just want to see the menu bar of the other application, I cannot imagine doing anything just with a menu bar.After some search on the internet I found the work around to do this in OS X. The answer is to press CMD+TAB followed by the option key (just before releasing the CMD key) to switch between the applications perfectly. You can also scroll your four fingers on the track pad to bring up all the applications and then highlight the application you want to choose to change the active application window. It is simply irritating to switch between keyboard and the track pad when you are typing some document or email. You can also use function key F11 instead of swiping the four fingers on the trackpad but at the end of the day Windows 7 does a great job here.Please do note that you can only switch directly between applications but not directly to the active window of an application when you use CMD+TAB, for example you cannot switch directly to a open second excel workbook, you have to bring up the excel application first and only then can you switch to the second excel workbook. I am aware that there is software available (namely Witch for $14) to do this but I already paid for the machine and why should I go through all this trouble and change the system registry entries to simply switch between applications.We can also use spaces and assign some shortcuts to spaces(like option+arrow) to make the switch between applications easier but you need to assign a different space to every application and this could be tedious after some time. Also the animations could make you dizzy after a while (not too sure whether everyone would share the same opinion) and there is no way you can turn off these animations AFAIK.Switching within an application - To switch between the various windows of the same application, the answer is to press CMD+~, it works but what if I have 3 open excel workbooks. Same answer as above, scroll the four fingers or press the function key F11 to see all active windows.Taskbar could be a big deal - It is irritating not to have a task bar in OS X. You can never actually know that you had two open excel workbooks or two separate browser windows at a glance. To put this into context, try working in Windows 7 grouping all your applications together all the time, in Windows 7 the users have the option to ungroup individual windows by selecting \"Combine only when taskbar is full\" in the taskbar properties. The problem with this approach in OS X is that you will never know all the application windows unless you display all the active windows or highlight the application in the docking bar.Also, the docking bar still occupies a substantial amount of screen space even in its minimal size , in Windows 7 the taskbar is comparively small. Due to the screen size and resolution constraints we usually tend to hide this docking bar on the 13\" MBP so that we can see the applications in the maximum available screen space. So either compromise on seeing the active applications in docking bar or full screen mode for applications.Again, the app Witch is the answer for taskbar but it will display these active windows only when we press CMD+TAB.Full Screen - I am addicted to seeing everything in maximized window mode in Windows 7 machines, I could never be satisfied with the default resized small windows, so I installed a free application RightZoom to address this issue. So far, so good.Quick Links - The docking bar essentially acts likes the quick link shortcuts in Windows 7. CMD+W closes the application and CMD+Q quits the application, you have to be careful enough not to press Q instead of W. Please note that closing a window does not automatically quit an application, the application is still active and consumes CPU resources.VPN Connection - Certain (or many?) VPN connection softwares like Juniper cannot be installed on OS X because some of these VPN connections connect using some plugins that are designed specifically for Internet Explorer, which is not available on OS X. I wanted to connect to work using the Microsoft Office remote desktop client but could not do it due to this restriction .External Applications - All the applications cannot be installed in OS X. There are lots of companies out there that make products just for Windows machines. I had to install StatTools for my course work and the tool was not available for OS X, so I had to work from another Windows machine at work on the weekends for my course work. I could have also installed Bootcamp and that comes up next.Bootcamp - I installed Windows 7 using bootcamp on MBP. I observed that Windows 7 is slow and the hard disk makes squeaky noises when you are trying to open an application in bootcamp, also the track pad experience is not the same despite the various drivers and the keyboard layout is obviously different. You can overcome these problems by connecting the MBP to a HDTV or any monitor and then using a wireless Windows keyboard + mouse but then the whole setup is too much hassle and defeats the purpose of a laptop.Microsoft Office - The experience of using Microsoft Office on OS X is pretty subpar in comparison to Windows 7, may be it the fault of Microsoft but it is simply pretty hard for someone to transition from Office 2010 in Windows 7 to Office 2011 in OS X. For example, I am used to zooming in and out of Microsoft Word using shortcuts like Ctrl+Scroll Up (on trackpad) and Ctrl+Scroll Down but this option is not available as shortcut in the OS X version of Office. I wanted to type a formula for a cell in Excel and cannot find the formula bar. May be someone can help me if they know a way around enhancing this experience.Delete button - There is no substitute to Shift+Delete in OS X(CMD+del). Deletion followed by emptying trash is the only way to do it, if you are someone who is addicted to deleting the file at once there is no shortcut. CMD+SHIFT+DELETE is a shortcut to empty trash after you delete something (so two steps, not a major gripe).Cut + Paste - There is no such option as 'Cut+Paste' in OS X. If you want to move something to a different folder, you have to copy and paste the file into the target folder and then delete the original from the source folder. Or select the file and carefully drag the file from the source into the target folder.Preview - Preview can be used to view PDF files and image files. Preview can also be used to make some markings in a PDF file, that is pretty cool. But what if I want to see all the pictures in a folder at once using preview, the only option is to select all the images and then right click to open with preview to see the files (In certain situations we can select all images and press space bar and the photos come in a stream slideshow. Also, every time you open a PDF or an image file the preview application becomes active, I would have preferred the application to quit automatically when I close the image). In summary, it is easier and cooler in Windows 7 to view images.Software Installation - There is no control panel in OS X. Just drag the application into the trash bin and it is gone. It has traces in your system but essentially it is gone for all practical purposes. I like this easy deletion aspect in OS X.Wakeup time - The MBP is pretty fast on this aspectMountain Lion - Mountain Lion will provide you the option to wirelessely stream the content from your MBP to HDTV if you own a Apple TV (I do not know the other improvements, this stood out for me), something similar to the WiDi on the Windows laptops. Thats a really cool option, you do not need to have any HDMI cables at all to stream content.**HARDWARETrack pad - This is something you would love to use and a big selling point, you can never think of going back to other laptops after using this. I always used a mouse on the Windows laptops but never even felt the need for a mouse on the MBP. The two finger swipe to scroll and three finger swipe that replace the 'Home' and 'End' buttons, pinch and zoom for PDF document and images are pretty cool options. I was pretty amazed at the track pad when I started learning more about the OS X.Keyboard - Keys are located spaciously. My previous two laptops frequently had dirt stuck in between the keys which used to drive me crazy.Heat - HP and Compaq laptops generate so much heat that you can use them as a personal heater (I used to do it). The whirring sound made by my Compaq laptop's heat fan used to be pretty embarrassing for me in my class or in the meetings, I hated opening the laptop. In a contrast, the MBP is very calm, the fan does go up occasionally when you run some intensive applications such as office (along with some other intensive applications) or play graphic video games but you will hardly notice it.Build - Unibody aluminum build with just 10 screws at the back is something you would appreciate only when you have used other laptops made of plastic material that make creaky sounds every time you lift them. The upper lid of these other plastic material laptops tend to wobble a lot over time but the MBP's lid is pretty stiff even after 7 months of daily use (at least 3 hours a day).Screen - I personally like the fact there is no slight gap between the glossy screen and border of the lid. In other laptops dust gets stuck between the screen and the plastic and it could be really irritating when you cannot remove the dust. Screen quality, there are different manufacturers for the LCD screen, please search for 9CC3, 9CC5 and 9CC7 to know more about this. I have a 9CC3 (luckily) and it is supposed to be the best one available for a 13\" MBP.Ports - HDMI port is not available directly but you can buy a 10 feet long HDMI output cable for less than $20.DVD Drive - Other laptops tend to have DVD drive as an attachment but in a MBP it is inseparable (at least by the looks of it). The DVD drives on the two other laptops I owned before MBP used to make a quirky sound when I used to wake them up from sleep or do a restart, no such sounds on the MBP.Battery - The longest battery life out I could extract from MBP was about 6 hours with browsing. That is pretty good considering that other cheaper laptops can only last for 2.5 hours. Of course you can upgrade your battery on the other laptops but you need to compromise on the weight.Power Chord and Charger - One of my friends accidentally tripped over a $1000 Sony Vaio's power chord and the machine fell on the floor with brute force. I still remember how anxious he was till the machine powered up. This would not happen with a MBP, the chord attaches to the MBP with magnet, in case of an accident the power chord would detach itself and nothing would still happen to the MBP. The adapter is light weight and you can carry it in a backpack (no big bundles like the ones you see for HP and Dell).Function Keys - I use the function keys in Windows 7 machines to close application, essentially which means that I am going to just use F4 for pressing Ctrl+F4 or Alt+F4. I like the Apple's way of function keys, pretty easy to use and only contains what we exactly need. Ctrl+F4 and Alt+F4 are replaced by CMD+W in OS X.Webcam - 720p & perfect for Skype.Backlit Keyboard - If you have not used one without a backlit keyboard before you will love this option.Resale Value - Based on the eBay listings I can say that you could expect to recover 75% of the actual value of a MBP if you maintain it well (if sold within a year of purchase).Apple Warranty - International warranty for 1 year + easy replacement within 3 months + Apple protection for 3 years for $200 (warranty is international again) is really worth it. I felt that my battery was losing its power quickly and Apple Store promptly replaced the battery for me.Cons (the only one)Speakers Sound - Sound is kind of low for me, I really wish that it was louder.So to summarize I am impressed with the hardware by every bit and I really do not have any complaints about the hardware design.******************************************************************************In conclusion, if you are going to use your laptop for Microsoft Office and want to connect to Windows machine through Remote Desktop or VPN, I would recommend not to jump the ship to OS X and instead consider other alternatives listed below. The experience of Microsoft Office, switching between applications and productivity is much better on Windows 7.I would still recommend a MBP if you want to buy a laptop for casual browsing and simple applications at home, the hardware design is pretty awesome and Apple support is trustworthy.Alternatives to consider - Similar hardware design with Windows 7 would be a very good combination and that brings me to Windows Ultrabooks. Ultrabooks are about the same price (or in some cases cheaper than MBP), faster with a SSD and are very appealing with Windows 8 soon on the cards. I read on tech websites that HP Envy Spectre 14, Lenovo U300S, Asus Zenbook, HP Folio 13, Dell XPS and Samsung Series 9 are pretty well built like a MBP but run on Windows 7. Samsung Series 9 looks pretty good and has a 15\" option as well, so thats some good news if you are a Windows fan.", "Date": "July 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Long Time Mac USER", "Author": "R.

Great laptop", "Author": "John Ryan", "ReviewID": "R2Q240RQGFCWUX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're like me, you'll have spent ages comparing features and specs before splashing the cash on a new laptop. I certainly did, and I finally settled for a Mac.Quick word of warning: I'm a recent (this model Mac) convert from Windows to a MacBook Pro, and was lucky enough to recently upgrade to a stunning 13 inch Retina. While I love Apple products, I'm not a Mac expert, and this review is for similar non-experts who are thinking about \"converting\". Because it's a review of the MBP range, you'll find the same review on other specs - skip to the end to see the specifics on this model.Be aware, this is NOT the very latest hardware (it's been replaced by the \"Mac Book Pro with Retina\"). However, there's a strongly compelling reason to buy this model (aside from the fantastic price), but you'll need to read on to find out.Firstly, the hardware - which is just stunning. It's nicely thin and relatively light, and the screen looks surprisingly big sitting here on my lap. In common with all Apple MacBooks it's beautifully carved out of a solid slab of brushed aluminium, with a huge track-pad and a beautifully made back-lit keyboard. Apple traditionally don't brag about their hardware specs (as it's all about the experience of the machine - not just about comparison of numbers, but....In terms of hardware there are lots of options.  The one I bought was:-* * 2.5 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with 4Gb of Memory (pretty zippy)* * 500GB hard drive (huge amounts of space for photos and videos)* * 13.3-inch LED-backlit display 1280 by 800 pixels* * Built-in FaceTime HD camera (for FaceTime or Skype calls)* * 8x slot-loading SuperDrive DVD - The last Mac Book Pro model to include one* * A Thunderbolt port for high-speed I/O and Mini DisplayPort to attach a monitor* * SDXC card slot (for photos), a FireWire 800 port, two USB 3.0 ports* * Gigabyte Ethernet connection and 802.11n Wi-Fi for wireless internet* * Beautifully designed backlit keyboard with ambient light sensor* * Preinstalled Mac OS X and iLife (free upgrade to Mavericks)Apple hardware (when comparing by pure spec) is more expensive than the equivalent running Windows, but you really do get what you pay for, and they come with incredible attention to detail. This includes the cleverly designed \"Mag Safe\" magnetic power socket - so if a small child accidentally pulls on the power cable it disconnects from the laptop rather than dragging it crashing to the floor.The only complaint I have is, all the connections are on the left hand side - including both USB ports, and it gets a bit cramped (I have two USB devices where the plug is too wide). I soon solved this by adding a set of external USB ports. Other than that - it's an wonderful laptop.As a prior Windows laptop user, the multi-touch trackpad is a real revelation. You can scroll down web pages (two fingers up/down), or scroll through web history (two fingers left/right), and the \"System Preferences\" window where you can configure the options includes a handy video demonstrating the options available. It's hard to over-state the benefit of this. It's so wonderfully accurate, it makes your laptop a real pleasure to use (again compared to my Windows laptop).As already stated, the keyboard is fantastic. Island style black keys - nicely spaced out, and back-lit. There's a set of dedicated keys along the top to control features including screen brightness, play, fast forward and stop, plus sound.Of course this is one the the last machines to get a CD/DVD drive - but even still all software is available online through the Apple Mac Store, and another nice surprise - consistently cheaper than equivalent windows software, and without the annoying collection of boxes, software keys and disks to avoid losing.Battery life is quoted at something silly - and I ran an entire day of general use (web browsing, videos, mails etc), in the end I got at least 6 hours before I started getting warnings - so you should be able to take this on a longish flight or a long train journey without any problems..Sound quality is not bad, although not as good as I'd have hoped - but I plug in external speakers myself - or better still, stream music to my Hi Fi speakers via an Apple TV. It's worth noting - you can stream anything on screen (videos or Netflix) to an Apple TV - including high quality sound. A great bonus.Although I don't often play games, I'm told the MBP is not a serious gaming machine, for for web use or video streaming it's more than capable. I can't really comment more than that.In terms of software, these are well provided for straight out of the box including free copies of:-* iPhoto - to import, edit and manage photos - including from the \"cloud\" (any photos taken on an iPhone or iPad)* Garage Band - a drum machine on your laptop* Movie Maker - to edit and publish home-made videos* Calendar, Mail and text editor etc* Reminders - to remind youSince I bought mine (July 2012), Apple announced anyone buying a new machine will also get a free copy of Pages, Numbers and Keynote (their presentation program) - but I'm not 100% sure if this includes this model as it's no longer the latest available. Even if you don't these are only around \u00a310-\u00a315 each - not the \u00a3100-\u00a3150 we're used to paying for Word. Excel and PowerPoint.During the past 18 months I've also noticed how the OS is becoming even more integrated with the iPhone, iPad and Apple TV. For example, you can now write a Pages or Numbers or Keynote (Word, Excel or PowerPoint for the rest of us) on a Mac and then view and edit them on an iPad (and the software is also free on a new iPad). You can also set a reminder on your iPhone and see it pop up on your Mac, or take a photo on your iPhone and see it appear (no wires, in fact completely automatic) on your Mac in the iPhoto application. This may not be a compelling reason to buy THIS particular model, but it is a great advantage if you already have (or plan to buy) and iPhone or iPad.But, (and this is ironic really), one the best reasons to buy this particular model of machine (and not the very latest Mac Book Pro with retina display), is you can upgrade it. It's a little known fact, that starting with the 2013 Macs, Apple decided to prevent ANY upgrades - including memory and disk. (The memory is literally soldered in place). If I understand it correctly, this is one the very last MBP models you can actually increase the memory or replace the hard disk. For example, I bought and installed a Samsung 840 EVO 250GB 2.5 inch Basic SATA Solid State Drive to upgrade the hard drive, and it now REALLY FLIES. Much faster than it was before, and it means I'll get a few more years out of it.Whenever I can afford it, I'll also buy a memory upgrade from 4Gb to 8 or even 16Gb.On balance - I'd have to say I love Apple Macs - and indeed all Apple hardware (iPhone, iPad included) so it's hard to give a purely objective view. But this is a beautifully designed, well built machine.

No you cannot. There are many PC laptops that have copied the MacBook design but not one of them comes close at surpassing it.  This is a laptop with almost no fault. Awesome design, great screen, great speakers, blazing SSD, and build quality only Apple seems to pull off at such a small size.You can shop around and find a lot of laptops that have better this and better that, but where Apple excels is making everything great and not skimping on anything. That is why I love this thing.Pros:Awesome ScreenGood SpeakersBoots in 14 secondsVery FastBest Trackpad design, no one even comes close here.Great KeyboardThunderboltCons:If at certain angles edges can be a little sharp.No DVD drive (does not bother me, but some might find it annoying)Keyboard lacks numpad (not a big deal to me, but if you work a lot with numbers it's something to think about)Only two USB ports (If you plan on plugging a lot of crap into your MBP then you might want to invest in a hub)So while the MBP is not perfect, it comes closer to it then any other laptop out there.

I come from the high-end Windows laptop user base; my previous laptop was a Dell XPS. I thought the transition would be difficult at best and would take some time to fully familiarize myself with the new Mac ecosystem. If you are considering switching from a Windows computer, do it. I have no regrets. OS X is simply amazing, and while there is a learning curve if you're coming from another OS, it's easy as pie to understand. Everything just works on a Mac. WIth the exception of some games- but with Boot Camp you can install Windows on any Mac.  And this MacBook looks as good as it performs. Simple details, crafted aluminium and real glass make this laptop blow away the other plastic ridden, bulky sticker filled laptops. This computer exceeds my expectations in almost every category.My only issues with the laptop are as follows:1) It looks beautiful. Yes, that's a good thing, but it's made from aluminum that scratches easily. You're better off buying a case alongside the purchase of your mac. A keyboard cover also wouldn't hurt. A scratch on a $1,500 MacBook is unforgivable.2) There is no HDMI port. This is an issue for me, as I frequently connect my computer to my television. But there is a simple solution; purchase a mini-displayport to HDMI adapter.3) The sound on this laptop is severely lacking. On my previous XPS (and other mid-range laptops) sound really wasn't an issue. But with this laptop, the bass is very weak and the sound comes out sounding tinny. My solution to this was to purchase Boom by Global Delight ([...]). Boom is a software application that adds sort of system wide equalizer to the Mac, thus affecting all outgoing sounds. It's a good fix, in my opinion. I have it set up to bass boost all the time, and the music comes out sounding decent, if not SLIGHTLY tinny (MUCH less tinny than before).So there you have it.

I could have a full charge and unplug it from the adapter and within one hour my battery would be going dead.I initially took my laptop to the Apple Store in South dale Mall sometime in July or August 2012. The tech ran some diagnostics on the laptop and reported to me that the logic board needed to be replaced. My system was held at the store for about two days.In November 2012 I took my laptop back to the Southdall Mall because I was experiencing the same issues and at that time I talked with three different techs for about two hours.

They are great and seem to be able to do just about anything.The new operating system makes this computer into a super iPad.  It does just about everything an iPad does except a forward facing camera BUT adds the feature of having a keyboard.  Yes it is bigger, requires a little more time to startup but I believe that the keyboard and actually having a real working computer make up for those two things.  You use the pad on the computer instead of on the screen on the iPad but they seem to work exactly the same.  Try typing on an iPad and then on one of these computers.  No comparison.  Until screens are developed enough on iPads to allow for quick data entry they will never be more than a viewing machine.  Not that that is bad but it is limited.A word of advice, when installing hardware like a printer or additional monitor DO NOT use the disk that came with them.  I did for my epson printer and that required me to call epson and they had to help clear out what had been installed.  Apparently this computer is smart enough to recognize just about any piece of hardware.  It also recognized my viewsonic monitor.The screen is clear, the keyboard lights up, you have the ability to upload your software to the cloud so that you can safely access it later.  It has the ability if you let Apple to locate it if it gets lost or stolen.  It does automatic backups either to the cloud or a drive or a stick storage.  Dang I think this computer is neat and very powerful.  It is even spell checking as I type here.BUTIt is expensive, with applecare, microsoft office and a vga adapter it ran almost $2k.As neat as this computer is do I need all this power.

Me, I am a physically broken 68 year old whose dell computer broke on him.  I use it for getting on the internet, playing games, watching a few movies while on the go and lastly to do a few spreadsheets and write some letters.  This computer is way overkill for me.  Will I keep it?  Sure, it does all that I want.  If Dell had been more helpful than I probably would have bought another one.

Then the system would many times not power down without a forced power-off. The problems only got worse: reformatted the system hard drive to try and fix the system and then it lost total ability to connect to the Internet.Thank goodness that I bought Applecare before the included warranty expired. So I brought it into the local Apple Store for repair. This was a mistake.After 14 days, and two separate trips, and even a phone call to support in between the first and second repair, I'm still not sure that they got it right. First they replaced the logic board and the second time the memory. In the last 4 days after the second repair the system froze with a tick-tick-tick sound until forced powered off.There was a large 4-day gap in the second repair when, after two unanswered calls to the store, the Store employee who finally answered my return call to them (which stated that they needed a call with my go-ahead) did not inform the original Apple store employee that I had authorized the go ahead, so the system sat not being repaired for 4 days until they called me again asking for the same authorization.Now I am wondering if the hard drive is bad and caused the OS corruption and not the RAM. I bet they didn't check this.I now believe that I cannot trust this system, nor the repair techs at the Apple Store that I took it into.I now want a replacement system, refurbished or new, since I've lost trust in this system now and have spent countless hours restoring from my backups. If this had been a work system, I would have been down for 14+ days.I loved my older MacBook Book Pro 15\" and it only needed a new logic board after 3+ years. This one was to be my dream replacement system and I am in no way confident that this will last 1/2 as long.Needless to day, I am really very disappointed in Apple. Poor customer service has really wrecked this experience for me. The only reason I am giving it above a 1 star is that when it works, the system is pretty awesome: fast, beautiful screen and physically perfectly sized.UPDATE 2/4/13: More problems surfaced since my last review. Video is now officially glitchy (white/random rectangles dancing across the screen before the screen goes black) and has joined a new problem: a 3-Beep (pause) 3-Beep (pause) repetition that occurs when coming out of sleep mode. This beep will not stop until the system is hard-powered down. Apparently, this has to do with a memory issue--like the RAM that they replaced at the Apple Store.I now have an escalation going with an Apple Care Senior Adviser, apparently higher than your standard Apple Care tech, who promised to fix this given the myriad of problems. At this rate, they will probably replace everything within the unibody shell before they simply give me even a refurbished replacement system.Update 2/28/13: after now weeks of remote analysis and reporting, and essentially nothing being fixed, I've now been authorized to mail in the system for repair (with promises that Apple will not let me be stuck with a non-working system). At this point, it is so unstable that I cannot even do a backup without the screen shuddering and then the system locking up completely. I'm resigned that the hard drive will need full replacement as well as the RAM, and that I will essentially need to rebuild the system (again) from the backups. I'm hearing 4-5 business days and NO promises of a new/rebuilt system at all.

I have been wanting to switch from PCs to Mac/Apple for a LONG, LONG time because I HATE Bill Gates (but that's a separate issue!) with a PASSION and I absolutely despise Microsoft and Windows-based computers. Until I got this MacBook Pro, ALL the computers I've had were PCs going all the way back to Windows 3.1 in the early 90's. But, no matter what kind of computer I've had (whether laptops, desktops or netbooks) and regardless of the brand (whether HP, Acer, Toshiba, Dell, Gateway, or some generic brand), and no matter what Windows operating system it used (whether Windows 3.1, Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 2000, Windows NT, Windows XP or Windows Vista), I had nothing but problems with the PCs from day one, with constant screen freezing, computer crashes, incredible slowness, viruses, spyware/malware/adware (despite anti-virus protection and anti-spyware/malware/adware software) and other hassles, while, most, if not every Apple user I spoke to said how much easier and user-friendly that Mac was -- and my own experiences using Apple/Macintosh computers all through school from elementary school through high school, was further confirmation. However, although I'd been wanting to switch to Mac for the past several years, I hesitated because of the price. I couldn't really afford it, and although I mentioned to my family how much I wanted to switch from PC to Mac, I didn't want to ask them (since they usually give major electronic items like computers as their main Christmas gift) to spend $1,200+ for a MacBook instead of the $500 -$600 max that they'd otherwise spend on a PC computer bought at Black Friday \"door-buster\" sales. So for at least 3-4 years I kept using the same crappy Windows laptop, while looking long and hard and comparing different Macintosh models and dreaming of someday being able to switch -- which finally happened this past Black Friday, when Best Buy had a sale for the 13 inch MacBook Pro for under $1,000 (okay it was $999, but still under $1,000!) which my family got me for Christmas. I am so glad they did, because I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my MacBook Pro!I am also VERY glad that my family got me THIS model, and NOT the Retina version, because the non-Retina MacBook Pro is the ONLY Apple/Mac product available now that still comes with an internal optical drive (although internal disc drives are not really a necessity with desktop models [like the Mac Mini or the iMac computers] that remain stationary and do not need to be carried around everywhere). Personally, I would MUCH rather have THIS MacBook Pro, and  I think its RIDICULOUS that the Retina version does not include an internal optical drive! Having no internal Blu-Ray in ANY of its products is bad enough but, especially, given the price-tag for MacBooks, lacking even a basic CD/DVD drive is ridiculous. Just because the greedy concept of \"planned obsolecence\" deems it necessary, does NOT mean that some of us are going to suddenly stop using and abandon/dispose of our dozens (if not hundreds!) of DVDs, CDs, cassette tapes and vinyl records, and just jump up to blindly embrace a disc-less and virtual future!I mean, although I only have probably about a half dozen or so Blu-Rays, I have HUNDREDS of CDs & DVDs (I lost count somewhere around 100, and wasn't 1/4 or even 1/8 of the way through the collection!) including both commercially-produced CDs & DVDs of music, movies & TV shows, as well as home-burned CDs and DVDs. I also have a few dozen vinyl records, and what seems like several hundred VHS videotapes, and audio-cassettes (either commercially-produced or purchased as blanks & painstakingly recorded personally) bought & collected, nearly all of which I still watch or listen to at one time or another. Many of us are not able to just jump like a jackrabbit from one latest technological craze to the next, from vinyl records and 8-tracks, to cassette tapes, to CDs and now to mp3s & iTunes, and from Betamax to VHS, to laser-discs to DVDs, to HD-DVDs, to Blu-Rays, and now to online video streaming. More importantly, not all of us are willing (or able to afford!) to suddenly replace our collections of music, movies and TV shows, recorded in a certain format, just because the technology has arbitrarily changed, often necessitating the re-purchase of that media in the new format. Which is why, even though I now DO have an mp3 player (which just got recently in the past year or two), an Apple TV (which I got from my brother this past Christmas) and a Sony television set with online streaming, I also still have & use not only a DVD player/recorder, but also a VCR, a 200 disc CD changer, a stereo with AM/FM radio & dual-cassette tape deck, and even a record player (a NEW Sony PS-LX250H Automatic Belt-Drive Turntable that I got a year or so ago) for vinyl LPs. Because its all videos or music which I enjoy watching or listening to, but yet, for the most part, I still don't like enough to waste money paying yet again to download it from iTunes (or other online streaming). Although it would probably be cheaper overall to just convert the music and videos to digital format on my own, it would probably take a lifetime to transfer everything -- and I'm not going to spend money to buy equipment to convert them to a format (like mp3) especially when, in a few years, it will likely just be deemed obsolete anyway!Which is another reason why I \u2661 my MacBook Pro! I LOVE that it includes an internal CD/DVD drive (and best of all, UNLIKE all my previous PC laptops, its NOT a bulky CD/DVD drawer, but rather just a sleek thin slot on one edge of the laptop). I'm almost always using my computer's CD/DVD drive to see movie or TV show DVDs or listen to CDs, and in my opinion having to carry additional components, like an external DVD drive totally defeats the purpose of even having a laptop (being a virtual replacement/equivalent to a desktop computer and yet also being portable enough to use it just holding it in one's hands while mobile!). Furthermore, its not like there's nothing available for those who want portable computing devices without optical drives. There ARE already more than enough options for them. They're called netbooks, iPads, iPad Minis, tablets, some kinds of Kindles, MacBook Airs, and even to a lesser degree, iPhones, smartphones and iPods -- and its one thing to make those without any disc drives because they are SUPPOSED to be ultra-portable, and CD/DVD drives would take up too much space & weight to keep them small and lightweight. But regular laptops are different, and what's the point of even having a laptop if a user is going to be bogged down having to lug around a bunch of other external peripherals like CD/DVD or Blu-Ray drives (as well as discs they want to play)  external hard drives & USB \"thumb\" jump storage drives, along with the requisite power cords/battery chargers................they may as well get a stationary desktop computer! UGH!!!! :\\In any case, the now-rare (since Apple have discontinued the internal optical drives in the 15 inch & 17 inch MacBooks and are planning to phase them out in the 13 inch ones) internal CD/DVD drive, is just one of the MANY things that I LOVE about my  Apple 13.3-Inch MacBook Pro. Even with only 4GB of RAM memory (though I'm considering buying a 16 GB of RAM memory \"upgrade\" from Crucial.com in the near future) this MacBook is LIGHTNING-FAST compared to any of the Windows computers I've ever had. Not only is it much faster, but Mac is far easier to use. For example, with every single one of the crappy Windows computers I've ever had, the screen/system would be freezing AT LEAST once or twice a day, if not more -- whereas in just the 4 or so months since Christmas that I've had this MacBook, I've only had like 1 incident of minor (far easier to handle than when the Windows PCs would freeze!) screen freezing, and even that was only when I was installing/updating some software so, in my opinion, the freezing was understandable -- and when I called Tech Support, Apple handled it so efficiently, that as soon as I spoke to them and did what they suggested, the computer was immediately unfrozen and I've had NO more problems since (though I don't even consider that particular incident a \"problem\")I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my MacBook Pro! The differences between this laptop and ANY & ALL of the Windows-based PCs I've had for the past 20+ years, is literally like NIGHT & DAY!Not only are Apple products much sleeker, and elegant-looking, but after experiencing first-hand how much faster and easier Mac OS is compared to Windows, I will NEVER, EVER buy a Windows-based PC or device again if I can help it! If only Bill Gates would spend more time trying to fix his bug-ridden, virus-plagued crap Windows PCs, and less time getting in bed with Monsanto & Merck and trying to pollute the planet and destroy mankind..........maybe then he'd be able to manufacture a quality product that, like Apple, is not vulnerable to every single virus and bug! There's a saying I heard from Apple users who said, \"Once you go Mac, you never go back!\", and its so true!

I am a resident of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and a customer of amazon for some time now. I have never had any problems with anything from the company but on the 29th of August I ordered a Mac-book Pro 13 inch Computer, it was to be delivered on the 4th of September. According to the tracking number it was delivered to the address that I use in the US for this purpose. On the 26th of September, after trying a number of avenues, I contacted Amazon telling them of my problem, so as to get some advice on how to track it down.I was incredibly but pleasantly surprised when I was offered a refund or replacement, where I come from this would never happen for an Item of this value.I did take a replacement and was willing to pay for expedited shipping when I was told that the company would do this for me at no extra cost, I am happy to say I received my mac-Book on the 1st Of October. I  am forever grateful to this company since a mac-book of this type costs approximately $12000.00 Trinidad and Tobago dollars and I have been saving for this for some time now.  I would like to say that Amazon has a customer for life since in reality it was no fault of their own the item went missing. Thank you Amazon and your wonderful staff( I think they all deserve a pay raise ;).Now on to the Mac-Book, while I never had a laptop PC before, I have had the use of quite a few, I am a practical person but if form can match function I would be satisfied. The Mac-Book is an amazing piece of hardware engineering, its beautiful to look at and exudes class, the screen is amazingly clear and crisp and the trackpad is heavenly to use. While there can be more USB ports, I suppose as a laptop there wouldn't be too many accessories attached since it may as well be a desktop. Another problem is that with extended use it becomes hot not overly so but it is quite noticeable. I am yet to fully explore the operating system and the programs on the computer but from the use that I did have, it is quite user friendly and  has exceeded my expectations.The one problem I do have is that there are some windows programs that have been the mainstay of the tasks that I usually have to perform. On the other hand the windows OS can be installed on the machine thereby giving the best of both worlds.

The laptop been a great educational tool (better then the iPads) and I can recommend it over any other Windows laptop. I am splitting this review into two parts, the laptop and the operating system.Laptop:The laptop is expensive; but you should consider it because of the stability and dependancy. The laptop is extremely quiet; even while I am typing this review I can hardly hear the fans going. Someone I know recently got a Dell laptop and the fans were so loud that it practically vibrated off the counter. Also, it hardly ever crashes. I did encounter a glitch that caused it to shut down without notice when I first started using it, but a month has passed and I have not seen it happen again. Along with the amazing durability is incredible speed. My Toshiba laptop will take three minutes to fully boot up and another five minutes to launch Chrome or Word. It's not an old laptop either; I received it roughly two years ago to replace my broken netbook. In comparison, Macbook Pro takes at most 30 seconds to boot and most applications will open instantly or within 10 seconds (with the exception of the Adobe software). The battery life is average, it will last almost 7.5 hours on normal settings. The graphics card supports split-screen (something my Dell could never do) and is able to render models with high-polygon count. It's a high-priced but worthy laptop.The operating system:What really kills Windows is the Mountain Lion OS, which is on the Macbook Pro by default. The UI (user interface) can be customized in almost every way; from repositioning the dock to changing the color of the menus. The \"multiple desktop\" function allows you create more than one desktop, allowing you to spread programs out. A simple swipe across the trackpad and you can switch between desktops easily. Applications are easily found by activating Launchpad, an iPad style grid. The UI is simple enough for most people to learn and includes a lot of bells and whistles for those who want full potential. Keyboard shortcuts are another handy thing that Windows lacks a lot of, by entering a key combination you can access Spotlight (Mac's version of the Windows start button), empty the trash, create new folders, even hide applications! Mountain Lion also offers voice recognition, by entering a key combination (FN x2 by default) the Siri mic will appear and you can speak whatever you want to be typed. Windows 7 has something like this,but  all I remember it doing was asking \"What was that?\". Along with easily access to these features you get various functions that Windows does not have. Airdrop is a mode that allows you to send to anybody on the LAN (Local Area Network). It has came in handy multiple times when I am in class and need to send a file to somebody. Dashboard is a special screen that has things like a translator, calculator, and sticky notes on it for easy access.Overall, Macbook is something you must get. Macbook can dual-boot both Windows 7 and Mountain Lion, so you can have both on one laptop if you must. The durability of the laptop will make it worth the money.", "Date": "October 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE LOVE LOVE!", "Author": "rolltide714", "ReviewID": "RB65C60F84XA2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being a tech savvy, APPLE - product loving person, I'm glad I finally got the MacBook Pro!

I have had PC's all of my life and have been afraid of Mac's because I was always told they were mysterious and complicated. That could not have been further from the truth, it is just a different type of operating system that downloads programs in app form. I just look at it as a bigger version of my ipod touch, same concept (well at least IMO).The weight is a non issue for me, I am allowed to have a laptop in three of my four classes, so I only bring the laptop to school along with my tablet and for that other class a standard notebook. It suits me. I like the fact it has a optical drive, I don't care that optical drives are apparently on their way out and that apple now has something you can hook your other non optical drive mac's up too, I really like the freedom of not having to drag around another piece of technology and be able to use it whenever I want. This machine is solid, and built very well, call me old school, but with laptops I have always prefered solid and an optical disc drive.The speed is wonderful, the sound is so-so, but it makes up for the performance of downloaded films from itunes. On my PC, the downloaded itunes films tend to lag, so it's really wonderful to be able to watch something and not have it lag and then freeze and then catch up with the dialogue a minute later.One issue I do have is it does not seem to get along with my Google/Android devices (phone and tablet) that I have tried hooking it up too, does not regard them, nor bring them up.

The added storage space is great considering I upgraded from 64 gigs to 500gigs. The only complaint I have with the machine is that when booting up the laptop after its been asleep causes a delay ranging from 15-40 seconds. This can be very frustrating when you need to get work done immediately.

Mainly bought a 15.4\" MacBook Pro as my older 13\" felt cramped for working with audio projects and using an external monitor often was getting tiring. With most storage products shifting to USB 3.0, I felt it was perfect timing to shop.Key highlight of owning a Mac is the iLife suite, iPhoto is still the leader of being a great photo album/management tool with some consumer friendly editing features, iMovie is the benchmark of easy to use video editing software and GarageBand went from being an audio recording platform for everyday users to adding more teaching lessons since '09. Out of the box you have a very nice ready to go creative machine.Hardware features:--15.4\" screen(non-high res) is still great, I prefer 16:10 displays over the squished 16:9 displays. While I'm not a fan of glossy screens the way Apple designed the glossy cover over the screen it keeps the backlight from bleeding vs makers who put a glossy coating onto the screen panel itself. Viewing angle on glossy vs non-glossy MacBook Pros is better than most notebooks on the market.--Processor, I know my review at this point is already \"old\" with Haswell(4th generation Core i) based computers reaching the market, Ivy Bridge(3rd Generation Core i) Quadcore easily crunches through encoding/decoding vs dual-core.--Graphics processor, this is the only reason you'll want a 15\" MacBook Pro/Retina MacBook Pro is the nVidia graphics as it can handle running software which are GPU dependent(animation, editing software and gaming). I can admit if you plan to do light gaming, consider using Boot Camp to run Windows 7 as you're able to use the newest/better nVidia graphics drivers--Apple only updates graphics drivers with software updates or new OS releases so performance can vary.--Bluetooth, in an era where most computers have this optional, Apple has always made this standard on their notebooks since 2004. Often I use this to sync my phone contacts/calendars/to do lists.--USB 3.0, this was my 2nd excuse to get a new Mac. Backups and transfering large projects via USB 3.0 is much faster than past Macs with USB 2.0.--Thunderbolt, at the moment you're either seeing PCIe expansion solutions for audio/video professionals or RAID storage products. With USB 3.0 being cheaper, I'm starting to worry this will fall into Firewire territory of only select groups of owners actually use it. Beyond highspeed, most users will use this for a 2nd monitor.--Firewire 800, looks like this could be the last Mac with it built-in based on the direction Apple is shifting towards. I use audio interfaces with Firewire so this is important. Older Mac owners may also still use FW400/800 external hard drives.--DVDRW Drive, some of us still use/need the drive and wasting bag space to carry one isn't ideal.Overall this is the only option for an aftermarket upgradable portable Mac. I didn't bother making notes on the memory/HDD as I cloned the HDD to a WD Black 750GB and installed 16GB of memory.

The exterior is absolutely gorgeous. The backlit keyboard is a great feature not to mention the key spacing makes typing so natural and easy. I also like how the rear apple logo stays lit while the laptop is on. When connected to Wi-Fi the Internet runs blazing fast and the screen quality is bright and crisp. Even after comparing this model with the MacBooks with retina display the little difference I saw didn't seem worth paying several hundred dollars more. 500GB is plenty of hard drive space for my needs and later on I might upgrade to 8GB of DDR3 memory but for now I'm very happy with its performance. I know some PC fans are hesitant to switch to a different operating system but honestly it's very easy to get used to especially if you've owned other Apple products in the past (i.e. iPhones, iPods etc...) The one and only thing I would change to match that of the PC laptops is on a MacBook tapping the touch pad does not serve as a \"click\" on a program. That's definitely a minor complaint so don't let my nit-pickyness discourage you. Sure MacBooks are a little pricey but take my word for it the investment is well worth it. These computers last on average 5-6 years which is way better than paying a little less and buying a PC laptop that is likely to break in a year.

I wanted the familiar Windows OS with the hardware the MBP had to offer, but initially ran into a few problems. I'll post the problems and their solutions that I discovered in case anyone else runs into similar problems.1. After installing the drivers for Windows, my webcam didn't work. It said that the drivers were not installed yet even after I downloaded the most recent driver package from Apple.Solution: it turned out to be pretty simple. My previous laptop had software preinstalled that controlled the webcam and added effects to it, and I erroneously thought that since my MBP didnt have this program that the webcam wasn't working. After installing the drivers my webcam actually worked fine with Facebook chat.2. The MBP got REALLY hot when running windows 7. This couldnt be good for the computer components, but also posed a fire risk.Solution: while on windows I installed a program called MacFan (just google it) that after typing in a few commands in the command prompt allowed me to turn up the fan speed indefinitely to significantly cool off the laptop. While in windows the fans aren't correctly utilized according to CPU usage so you'll have to do this process upon each startup. Just search on YouTube \"how to install macfan\" for thorough instructions.3. Videos on youtube while in windows do not expand fully to the screen, instead leaving black bars on the bottom and right sides.Still haven't solved this. I'd expect adjusting the screen resolution would have an effect but I haven't tried this yet.4. The battery life decreased from 7 hours to about 2.5 hours while on Windows.This couldn't be solved either. It's just how windows works on the Mac. The only solution is to turn the brightness down, etc.5. When I click an icon on the taskbar, its title flashes over it. (not the biggest deal but its annoying)Updated my Nvidia drivers from their website and it solved minor graphics problems.As for my actual review of the MacBook Pro, I am very satisfied. I run both windows 7 and mountain lion on it through bootcamp (helpful detailed instructions can be found on YouTube). That way I have the ability to run all my old games and programs on windows while having the Mac side to use for top notch picture and video editing, plus the App Store. I've always preferred the relative simplicity of Microsoft office 2007 for windows, so I use that.After adjusting trackpad and click settings on the windows side, navigation is easy and fluid. The separated keyboard buttons took some adjusting to but that's not any issue. The screen is bright, clear, and rich while the backlit keyboard helps for typing in dark environments.It's about 2 pounds lighter than my previous laptop and significantly thinner, and what I'd consider to be portable. Ill be using it at college next year and will report back on just how portable it is.Graphics, processing, and RAM are all lightning fast and should be useful in intensive software that ill be using. The only problem I've noticed is that after partitioning the hard drive, startup takes a little longer (around 22 seconds total).The power cord is portable and extendable, while its nice to still have the optical drive, Ethernet port, and card slot. Only having 2 USB ports so close in proximity is a minor issue with larger thumb drives, etc. but I may just purchase a separate hub.All in all, you won't regret buying this.

It has a 90 degree bend in it that either requires the cord to bend along (and partially cover) the various ports on the side of the laptop or bend away to the rear which generates a long loop for me the way I plug it it with the possibility of accidentally popping out.Pro:  Besides delivering the higher level performance that I expected of the new platform, the display on the MBP is much better than my old MacBook which had a poor quality display with a waviness I never liked and poor off-angle viewability.", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "A great laptop for the money", "Author": "Vikram Jairam", "ReviewID": "R8D7TTB1G3MVF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: Fast CPU.

I wanted to explore what the Mac was all about. 6+ years later it's still working just fine, but with a limit of 2 gig of RAM, it was getting a bit slow and behind the times.It's nice to see Apple still making a laptop with a DVD/CD drive. The price from Amazon was GREAT, so, I had to order it. The buying experience was good. However my experience with UPS was a 0 on a scale of 0-10. The driver did not knock on my door, left a post it note notice. I went to UPS that night. The driver had checked in and they could not find the box. I was told it would be at Pick Up the next day. I went back the next day, they could not locate it, and discovered that it was on the truck. I missed the driver by 3 minutes. He did leave it with a neighbor, and if I had not found the driver who was exiting the apartment complex, i would have had no idea where he left it. Bad UPS, BAD.Anywho, back to the MacBook Pro. While the screen is not Retina, it is still superb. Far superior to my MacBook. The build quality is typical Apple, solid, solid, solid. The SuperDrive is quiet. Sound quality is very acceptable.I haven't had it long enough to test battery life, but I will assume that up to 7 hours is realistic.The Intel i7 processor and 8 gig of RAM makes this a great desktop replacement.Based on my time with the Black MacBook I decided to take out Apple Care. It did come in hand once way back when and more than paid for itself the first and only time I used it. By the way, the Black MacBook is still running strong. All I needed to do for it was replace the battery in February 2013 as it had swelled.The MacBook Pro may look pricy at first, but due to the build quality, parts used and it having an aluminum body, I can see this one lasting 7 years or more. In that light, the 13.3\" MacBook Pro is very reasonable in price and a winner in performance. And with Parallels 8 I am also using Windows 98SE, XP and 7 on my MacBook Pro. All run as if they were on a native Windows desktop machine. The 8 gig of RAM and the i7 processor make running virtual software a snap. With the latest MacBook Pro I actually have 4 computers in one. The latest version of OS X, and three versions of Windows.

The iMac is still functioning for the kids and still works great after 8 years. The issue is we can no longer upgrade to the newest version of OSX thus we don't get the benefits of the new features. The new MBP offers great portability and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to purchase a new laptop in 18 months. Something we did often when we purchased Windows based laptops.Apple OSX is simple to use and has a more enjoyable and intuitive interface than the new Windows 8. I'm not saying it's for everyone but it's a great solution if you want a simple to use device that you know won't be at the end of it's life cycle in a couple of years.Pros-Great functionality-Integration with iCloud and many of the apps you use on an iPad and iPhone.-Log battery life even with wifi on and streaming movies via netflix-Very durable unibody case-Still has an optic drive-Mag Safe power cord is a nice touch-Intel i5 processor works very well-The chicklet keyboard is AWESOME!-The single best function is the backlit keyboard. There is nothing worse than trying to work on a plane and not being able to see the keys without an overhead light that blinds you.-The track pad is incredible. I'm a person that will not use a laptop without a mouse. I just don't like trackpad's because they never work right. That is until now. I can easily use the Apple Track Pad without any issues and now I don't even travel with a mouse. My bag just got a little lighter. I do however like the Apples Magic Mouse but I really don't need it.-It just works. We found that out when our new MBP found all the office and home printers, installed drivers and started working with no effort on our part.Cons-Heavy compared to Ultrabook laptopsRecommendations: I would definitely recommend 8 Gigabytes of RAM. Just because the processor is a 64bit architecture and can efficiently utilize the RAM. I wouldn't by the factory RAM just because it's expensive. Amazon has a nice selection of RAM from various suppliers that will work. We went with the Corsair Vengeance 8GB (2x4GB) DDR3 1600 MHz (PC3 12800) Laptop Memory (CMSX8GX3M2A1600C9).If you have never installed RAM in a Mac Laptop go out on YouTube and watch a couple of videos.

Datavision (Amazon's reseller - you're not getting it straight from Amazon) informed me that I could take it to a local Apple Store for a \"replacement,\" which is simply incorrect. An Apple Store would attempt to repair this same unit under warranty. My other option was to mail it, insured, AT MY OWN EXPENSE, back to Datavision for an exchange.Extremely disappointed both with the product and the experience buying it from Amazon. I advise buying direct from Apple or choosing a different authorized reseller than Amazon's \"Datavision\" retailer.Anyway, I've elected to have the Apple Store attempt to repair the unit. I may update the review as the adventure progresses.UPDATE 1/10/13! The Apple Store sent it off under warranty, and it returned in just a couple of days with a new logic board and magsafe (power charger) component in the laptop.SCREEN -Noticeably brighter than my 2006 matte screen MacBook Pro. I was worried about the glossy, reflective screen, but inside at least it's perfect. I have yet to attempt to use it outside. No dead pixels. Great color. No issues.PERFORMANCE, HEAT & NOISE -Very fast. The 2.6 GHz processor, 8 MB of RAM and the 1 gig NVidia 650M graphics card all make a zippy machine. I also like the fact that it has an additional on-board graphics card, and automatically switches between the two as needed to extend battery life and reduce heat output. Overall, runs much, much cooler than my 2006 MacBook Pro.The traditional magnetic hard drive suits my needs just fine - no need for an expensive SSD. This machine lets me edit large photos in Photoshop CS5 quickly and easily, with little to no delay in rendering.The hard drive is very quiet. The optical drive machinery makes more noise than I expected when it takes in a disc, but it reads CDs/DVDs quietly and effectively once it gets started.BODY -The unibody construction really does feel lot more solid than Apple's previous laptops. The screen hinge works well and appears durable.OVERALL RECOMMENDATION -4/5. It's a great machine. Get it if you can afford it. Buy it from Amazon direct, not from another reseller.Why not 5/5? Mine arrived with a dead logic board and no ability to charge the battery--a $2,000 brick. The Apple warranty got it repaired for free in just a couple of days, however. I bought AppleCare and would not be surprised if other parts need replacement over the next three years, just as my previous MacBook Pro had its logic board, topcase, hard drive, battery, and optical drive replaced through Applecare. Apple seems to periodically have bad batches of logic boards, but according to the other customer reviews on Amazon I just got a lemon and the vast majority work perfectly.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Machine! Easy transition from Windows.", "Author": "JMX", "ReviewID": "RYCFUIN5YETAI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been a PC user for most of my life. I used windows XP, windows Vista, and Windows 7 extensively. Most recently, I put Windows 8 on my old Dell laptop in an attempt to breathe new life into it. This plan ended when the hinge holding the screen on finally gave out. I purchased this computer from Amazon during the Black Friday sale, and got a much better deal than Apple was offering. Though the computer ships with Lion instead of the current Mountain Lion OS, the free upgrade that Amazon describes was processed and approved by Apple within about 10 minutes. The computer arrived very well packaged and in perfect condition.Hardware: The Macbook pro's physical form is wonderful. Not only is it beautiful, but it feels really solid. Screen is bright and gorgeous. Trackpad is nothing short of dazzling when compared to competing Windows systems. Wake up time is very short. Sound from concealed speakers perfectly adequate for normal listening.Software: Though I was excited to try Mac, I was a little apprehensive. I have been a PC person for many years and feel really comfortable navigating Windows to accomplish tasks. Not only is Mac different, but Mac programs (in my experience) typically expect you to think in a slightly different way when trying to figure out how to do something new. I was a bit worried that I would experience some frustration. My fears, however, were unfounded. The system is amazingly intuitive, and, after a short learning curve, you begin to feel like Mac is a big improvement over Windows 7, and that Windows 8 is an unsuccessful attempt to recreate Mac successes. For example, I feel like the new Start screen is analogous to the Launchpad, but more cluttered and a bit clunky. Anyway, the transition is not difficult, and the experience trumps Windows easily.WHY THE MACBOOK PRO, WHY NOT THE AIR? I did consider purchasing the Air instead of the Pro. I was attracted to the all flash architecture of the air. Solid state drives don't wear out, even after 5+ years of operation. Also, lugging around a heavy computer just in case I need it is a peeve of mine, with the result that I often don't have my computer when I need it. The Pro is by no means a heavy computer, but the Air is remarkably light. I don't really believe I would have ever missed the optical drive, as I still have a desktop that I can use to burn CDs/DVDs and to store massive files that would overwhelm the relatively small solid state storage of the Air. Why, then, did I get the Pro? Longevity for one. I expect a laptop to last around 5 years at this point. While the base Pro and Air have similar performance ratings, in two years I can open the bottom of the Pro and easily and cheaply upgrade the RAM. I also plan to put in a solid state drive at that time. This can all be done more cheaply than paying Apple for the upgrade right now. Also, though I understand why it may be reasonable to make the Air without an Ethernet cable, my office at the university does not have Wifi. There are no plans to expand coverage to my office and I am not permitted to expand the network on my own. This means I am restricted to ethernet connection. I realize that there are USB and Thunderbolt adapters for this, but I would need to use this adapter literally every day. In the end, I don't think it would be worth the hassle. Also, some users report issues with getting the Air to use these adapters, a situation which would be extremely negative for my work situation even on a short-term basis. In the end, these reasons led me to get the Pro over the Air, and I am highly satisfied with my decision. The relatively greater mass of the Pro is not an issue, as the computer is still highly portable, and not having to mess with the ethernet adapter is a pro that I am already grateful for.Overall, my experience with this computer has been great. I would highly recommend the switch, and I will not be returning to the Windows platform for the foreseeable future.", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Solid laptop with no noticeable flaws", "Author": "Warhawk", "ReviewID": "R28LTDZK600NDB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My previous Macbook was a 2011 Air, also 13\".I bought the base model as I was to upgrade the RAM and HDD myself, and the processor upgrade wasn't worth it to me.Initial thoughts:- Boot-up is much slower than my last Macbook Air because of the HDD instead of an SSD- Screen does look better even tho it has a lower resolution- Keyboard is a tad stiffer than Macbook Air- Hearing the DVD drive spin up every boot-up is strange, but not annoying- Much better graphics and processor performance- Thickness or weight doesn't bother me, since I use it as my main computer- Mic is above the 'esc' key and not next to the fan vent like the Macbook Air- Runs much cooler and quieter- USB slots are next to each other instead of one on each side- Upgraded to 8gb ram(http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Y4XAAK/ref=pe_175190_21431760_M3T1_SC_dp_1) shortly afterMore Detail:- Boot-up takes around 45 seconds compared to my Macbook Air taking around 15 seconds.  Applications also start slower, instead of almost all my apps opening instantly, it takes 2-3 seconds.  An easy fix to that will be an SSD which I should be getting November sometime and will update this with comparisons.- I compared my roommate's 2011 Macbook Pro 13\" to my 2011 Macbook Air 13\" before I sold it.  His looked much better, darker blacks, more saturated and warm.  My Air looked stale and not as detailed as his Pro. The resolution is only 1280x800 compared to the 1440x900 of the Macbook Air, but I kind of like that better because text is bigger and I don't have to squint as much(not that I did that much before).- The first time I typed my name and password for the Pro I noticed the keyboard is slightly stiffer. I can say I liked the Macbook Air's keyboard better, but not a lot to be bothered by it.  Having used it for a month now, I don't even notice it anymore.- Having no DVD drive for almost a year was amazing, but frustrating the few times when I needed it. The noise isn't loud when turning on the computer, shouldn't be enough to wake someone up in the same room that is sleeping. Now I can't move my Mac around as fast since it has more moving parts in it, but thats not a big deal for me.- Graphics are much improved.  The comparison Apple gives is 60% improvement over the previous generation, however I went from a 2011 Macbook Air to a 2012 Macbook Pro. I'm not sure if thats more than a 60% improvement as I don't have a 2012 Macbook Air to compare.  Lets just say with my Macbook Air I had to have the lowest settings on Starcraft 2 to play a 3v3 game online and it would still lag later on and dip below 20fps.  WIth my Macbook Pro I can have medium settings on a 3v3 and have a steady 50fps the whole game.  The only time I could have a steady 50fps on high settings was a 1v1 game. However, medium settings look 10x better than low(mainly from shaders), while high settings looks only 2x better than medium.  Other games like Portal 2, Left 4 Dead 2, Torchlight 2(Windows Boot Camp), League of Legends, Half LIfe 2 series, CS:GO, TF2 I could get almost the highest settings(usually excluding AA) and be smooth.  Converting video via Handbrake was also quicker on the Macbook Pro, I don't have a video for proof, but from what I remember it was at least 2x as fast.- I used my Macbook Air for everything including school, work, games, video, music, etc. So it was on my desk 90% of the time.  So naturally moving to a thicker and slightly heavier Macbook Pro had no affect on me.  Even when I use it on my lap while watching TV or helping someone on the XBOX with a game, it doesn't feel like a brick.- My biggest complaint on the Macbook Air was the placement of the mic.  It was right next to the exhaust vent, so when I was playing any game online and using Skype, the other person could hear the fan blasting at a full 6500 rpm.  The mic on the Macbook Pro is now above the 'esc' key and not right next to the fan, much better design decision.  I've played games online and people don't hear the fans anymore.- As I mentioned before, while playing a game on the Macbook Air the fans would climb to 6500 rpm fast and be very loud and quite hot to the touch in the upper left corner of the laptop.  The highest I've seen it on my Macbook Pro is 5300 rpm, and it doesn't always do that.  Strangely enough it would do that on Starcraft 2 then would dip down to about 3000 rpm during a game and I couldn't hear it anymore. So noise is reduced at least 50% and the heat is much better, now it doesn't feel hot but warm.- The USB ports are right next to each other on the left side which is fine by me since my laptop is on the left side of my desk, so everything is out of the way for me.  On my Macbook Air cords would come out of both directions and cause a mess sometimes.  Even if it was the same as the Macbook Air, wouldn't bother me much.  Just be sure to have a USB drive that isn't super thick or you can't fit another next to it.- I was restricted to 4gb of ram on the Macbook Air which I thought would be fine before purchasing.  However I was new to Macs and didn't know that OSX uses a lot more ram than Windows, which is fine because its a lot more responsive, I just wish I had known before hand.  For me, after booting up with no apps open it was taking around 2gb or half the ram already.  Windows used around 500mb-750mb with no apps open.  So if I were playing a game, I couldn't have any other programs open or it would run slower.  I also had to keep track on how many tabs I had open in Chrome or Safari, especially if they had flash content like Youtube.  With 8gb of ram I can have Safari running with several tabs, Mail, Spotify, Preview, Textedit, and Steam open while playing Starcraft 2 and it doesn't slow down at all.- Another random note to mention is the screen bezel is black and not white. I kind of like the black better, especially when playing a game or watching video when the screen is darker.Overall I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and can't wait to get a 256gb SSD and watch this thing fly.That is really the only thing I miss from my last Macbook Air.Will edit my post when I get an SSD and if I find other things I forgot to mention.Hope this review was informative!", "Date": "October 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Another great experience with Apple with a Caveat for Video Editors", "Author": "F.

The speed: Very, very fast, it boots in less than 30 seconds and loads up all your applications and documents flawlessly. Not to mention the 8gb of RAM (Great addition).2. The looks:  The attention to detail on this computer is simply amazing from the aluminum finish, to the little lights on the keyboard, it really is a quality product.3. Its Apple, you know you're getting a reliable product which devaluates very little in time, as you may see any Windows computer goes from being $1300 (A very good one) to around $300 dollars in 2 years. Apple products retain their value and don't devaluate very fast.4. You may find reviews that say \"This computer can be beaten by any PC at half the price\" but the thruth is you're not only paying for a great quality product, but also one that will really satisfy you for a long time, and one you may sell in 1-2 years for 30% less of its retail (Compared to a PC's 70%)In the end you will find that, if you decide to buy this product, it was totally worth it.

It was getting old and I needed a new school computer. I was looking around and I knew I wanted something fast, able to multitask, and very portable. I also like to play games so I needed some nice graphics. I kept looking at the 15\" because it had good graphics and a good processor. But I thought that it was just a tad too big for my needs. I went into the apple store and I was looking at the 13\" and I knew that it was perfect. It has a great screen, it is the perfect size, it is not too heavy and it is very powerful (Ivy-Bridge processor :D ). I was not sure about the new Intel HD 4000 graphics but I decided if I could not play may favorite game that it would not be the end of the world. So I got home and I booted it up, put windows 7 on and started my favorite game (Just Cause 2) and it worked!!!! So I am very pleased with my purchase. Overall this computer is perfect for my needs. If you want something with more graphic power I would go with the 15\" but if you want something portable and powerful (average user) then this is a perfect laptop.ConsThe screen does not have a high resolution compared to some PC's. (Not that noticeable)It is a bit pricey. Average PC with the same specs = around $800-But an important note is that if you treat your computer well your macbook pro will last a long time. My old Macbook was made from plastic and it still lasted me almost 6 years.  It is still running well not running its more at a walking pace right now but it works.

She claimed it was imperative that she have a MBP for school.  She makes videos for some classes and said Macs are best for this.  She also told me she needed FCP X.  So, I paid out $1500.Power cord failure after 6 months. Common complaint, Google it.About 9 months after purchase the glass monitor cracks.  Of course I thought my daughter had dropped it, but a witness--her grandmother-- said it made a \"pop\" sound while sitting on the table, and just cracked.  We had to replace that on our dime. Common complaint; Google it.One year after purchase my daughter goes abroad to study.  Shortly thereafter her MBP starts to act up, but can she find anyone to service this computer, on the island where she is living? Of course not. (Note:  the University she is attending is still using FCP 7 and ancient Mac systems; exchange students beware). So I have to FedEx her trusty old Samsung netbook from way back, the same $269 netbook that she took to the Amazon jungle eons ago, to get her through the rest of the semester.Daughter returns home midyear, we pay for logic board repairs, and off daughter goes again, this time to study in Turkey. Within 2 months of arriving in Istanbul, her MBP is showing the gray screen with the ? and all you Apple users know what THAT means. We tell her, take it to the Apple store.  She says, what Apple store? There is NO Apple store in Turkey! So she takes it to an \"Apple authorized service center\" but they won't work on it, they say it might be a hardware problem, and besides, Apple is opening a store soon, take it to their Genius Bar.So in the meantime I am once again Fedexing yes, you guessed it, the trusty, banged up, dented, scratched 5 yr old Samsung netbook to Istanbul.  While the $1500 MBP w/FCP sits, a cool, cold, and beautiful reminder of a bad relationship, awaiting it's fateful appointment (3 weeks away) with the Genius who will nicely inform my daughter that she will have to pay several hundred dollars if she wants her MBP working again.And surprise! Now my daughter discovers that none of her peers are using FCP X because it is too costly, too restrictive, too difficult to learn, and they are going back to PCs and using  Avid and Adobe!In a few months my daughter has an assignment to North Africa. She is taking the old Samsung netbook with her, and leaving the Macbook Pro (as she says, selling for parts) behind in Istanbul.If you are the type of urbanite who has access to an Apple store and/or can call Apple care toll free, maybe a MBP is for you.

Counting the one this came with, this was the fourth to go down. Apple finally threw in the towel, and replaced the unit.  While I appreciate this, it is something that should have been done after the first replacement failed. Apple's failure to respond appropriately cost me not only time, but a significant amount of money lost when commitments couldn't be met (backing-up work means little, I've found, when you don't have a place to recover it to. Repair turnaround on this laptop averaged a week or more.) As I see it, Apple had an identified problem (witness similar complaints across the web) and their delay in acknowledging that this problem was not \"fixable\" was not just inconsiderate, it was irresponsible. Apple is allegedly a premium brand -- and yet they offer not only a product with quality control issues, but just-fell-off-the-back-of-a-truck customer service.Original Review: Just had the second motherboard replacement -- and this laptop is not even a year old! Also had one power cord replacement, one track pad replacement, USB port replacement...you name it, it's blown. \"Genius\" (sic) techs also screwed up my data recovery -- all but the most recent hour had been backed up, but I needed it -- we tried to attached the external disk drive before they sent it in, but somehow they crossed a couple of wires and fried everything. I had to pay an outside company, recommended by the Geniuses, to do data recovery. Said company explained it was not unusual for the Geniuses to screw up in this way.Searching the web, I see a lot of people have similar/identical problems with this model.Obviously, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.However, if you want to take the risk, here are a few observations:I sent for the 13.3-inch, which in retrospect is a little tight. I probably would have sized up.I'm not crazy about the OS. It's not nearly as intuitive as they claim.

I had been wanting a MacBook for three years before I actually had enough money to purchase one. I am a college freshman and I bought my MacBook Pro mainly for school and so far I am loving it! The screen is nice and very clean. The downside to the screen, however, is you can't see in direct sunlight (which is a problem for someone like me who likes to sit outside and do work on the plaza at my school) and it is a magnet for dust and lint. The laptop is very lightweight and portable; I rarely even notice it's in my backpack! The keys are very well lit and comfortable to type on and you don't hear the annoying click-clack that most keyboards make (a plus for someone like me who enjoys the quiet). The sound is nice and loud; I don't have any problems with hearing anything. One of my favorite things about it is that you can't hear it running. I've had this laptop for only a week now but I've had it running pretty hard with all apps open and it'll just get hot, but you can't hear the fan or computer running. This is perfect for when I'm in class taking notes because I don't get distracted or annoy others by the computer being loud and disruptive. I only have two complaints: 1) the laptop heats up pretty fast but it doesn't burn your leg or anything and 2) the battery indicator is very indecisive, meaning that the \"Calculated Time Remaining...\" isn't too accurate and it'll show only 4 hours left after I've completed a full charge and have my keyboard lights off and my screen at half brightness.

I am pleased to report that it is one of the best presents I have received to date. I had been wanting alaptop for a long time. In my home we have a desktop computer in the family room. This is where I would do all of my homework, but because of my other family members this became more and more strenuous. My mac laptop fixed this issue.  This laptop is a fine device, it is very sleek and modern. I actually enjoy using this laptop whenever I open it. The screen resolution is crisp and clear.  The 13 inch width of the screen works great for me. The screen doesn't feel to big but at the same time It still doesn't feel too small.  I have never used a mac before, and I was scared that my steep learning curve would be a major issue. But i was pleasantly surprised to find out that I was wrong. Much of the user interface on the mac is pretty intuitive. Also when their is something that a user does not know but needs to find out, google is a quick and easy way to find this knowledge.  Mac's also seem to be quite durable! i have dropped mine a couple times with only a slim plastic case covering it. Yet my mac continues to function properly. Also I have spilled water on it once or twice and my mac still continues to work perfectly.  I would recommend buying this mac to anyone who is looking for a sleek and trendy personal computer, that is also functional and durableThe cost is a bit high but worth it in my opinion.

Soft touch, anodized aluminum with laser cut precision and no flaws. I love the little rubber seam that runs all the way around the edge of the screen that protects the screen from being scratched by the palm pads of the inner side. The keys are durable, and only start to wear out (become shiny) after about 1,000,000 hours of continuous use. I have another 2008 Black MacBook That has seen the most lengthy writing sessions with much sweating upon, and the keys still feel as good as new. I don't like the fact that the Screen is a fingerprint and dust magnet, but I fix that by wiping the screen down as a thing I do every Saturday Morning. The paint indicators on the side of the MacBook indicating which port is which has slowly become rubbed out from abrasion, but I know what port is now, so its ok. I wish I still had the paint in case I needed to sell it. The fan exhaust is located right under the screen hinge, and since it is easily covered, the laptop easily heats up. The trackpad is as smooth as velvet. I wish it was a entire button, so the trackpad wouldnt have to bend down when you press it at the top, but I've gotten used to the old way of thinking and using my thumb as a button-presser.Software:I can't say muchI love Macintosh. Grew up with it from OS 8I love how seamless and flawless it is. I can't wait for Mavericks, and I know it'll be a bestseller.I really love the fact that Mac has an app store with its constantly growing database, and great games.I wish iLife came hooked up to your account as soon as you enter your apple id with icloud so you can update it as part of your app collection, but since it doesnt cost that much, its coolHardware:Apple always has bleeding edge performance and I love their support of everything out thereMy Mac rarely ever lags, and even when it does, (unless the fan is blocked), the fan is almost unnoticeable. I've heard that they fixed the problem with the new Retina Display MacBook Pro though with the adjusted frequency fans. I really want to try that out for my self.I also love the super fast Ivy Bridge 2.6 Ghz processor with Great battery life.They only fact that I wish they had done was refresh the ENTIRE Mac lineup along with the MacBook Air's when they changed the processors to Haswell.Overall:I love this product.I love appleJust wish they continued the color variety.I dont know how much effort it would take to make an anodized black macbook pro, macbook air, and a iMac, but if they did, I know that if they did, people would trip over each other just to get their hands on one of themI know I would.So until that happens, I'm sticking with this.", "Date": "August 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "So Far, So Good", "Author": "Judy T", "ReviewID": "R2TXT4IAQ22JO3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the MacBook Pro MD103LL/A on 7-30-13 and received it from Amazon (through DataVision) on 8-2-13.I've had this computer now for one week and love it.I also bought the AppleCare Protection Plan for this computer from Amazon on 7-30-13.I received that on 8-8-13, registered for this plan, and look forward to using it if the need should arise.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great and fast", "Author": "Nicky Rus", "ReviewID": "R37630LCJ92KIE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Highly recommended, insanely fast and great computer, doing heavy multi-taking and office work etc all at once and it just runs and processes flawlessly, the battery life is extremely great as well.", "Date": "August 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Apple MacBook Pro MD101LL/A", "Author": "worldunix", "ReviewID": "R1IZ48TWWDJ5R8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this for my Kid for CollegeShe love itreplaced her older one that i now use :-)Get one you wont go wrong", "Date": "August 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great computer", "Author": "Hannan", "ReviewID": "RQSWJJI0K7GFU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great computer, very happy with this purchase.Mac runs just the way you'd expect it to.No problems at all.Highly recommended!", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mac Book Pro 13\" Great Brand and Great price!", "Author": "SuperClear", "ReviewID": "R75V6THAM2CG9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Mac Book Pro 13\" is a perfect Laptop if you want use it for your home.

Although there  is a small learning curve for Mac OS to get some hands on - but as I am familiar with Linux I am very comfortable with Mac OS... this is the only thing I see difficult with Mac Book .... and this is advantage in other sense coz you will be amazingly in a new world of OS and features...... and even if you are too restricted to MS Windows, you still can have partitions and Windows installed virtually or through boot camp... with all native speed...2. Macs never crash... I never see any application taking too much to respond and going nasty ....and same applications I saw going goofy on my other laptop which carries Windows with similar hardware.3. There are no issues at all with internet security and virus attacks... I don't even have any anti-virus ...4. If you are restricted to Word processing applications like MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint, you can have MS Office on Mac just in $119... but if you are not restricted but still want this capability, Open-office can solve all your problems...5. You can make Mac virtually same as Windows if you are Microsoft fan.... I am also Microsoft fan and doing the same....6. Incredible display, laptop size and weight.... great battery backup...7. accept trusted content only e.g. tools, software etc.8. No other brand has touch pad like Mac .... you don't even need lot of keys from keyboard or mouse when you have MacBook touch pad with youDisadvantages:1. Cost is more as compared to other brands. Other brands can come with higher configurations in same cost.... but Mac is Mac2. learning curve for OS and other features3. less free stuff compared to other communities... accept programs from trusted developers only", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Joe241", "Author": "Joe241", "ReviewID": "R3UU1BQ7QR5HGO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose this product for their exellent craftsmanship and fame of apple.

For personal reasons, I needed hands on.  One reason that I can share is that I had been an MS user for years ... and put up with the many frustrations associated with MS.  The latest frustration was having a certain brand of laptop, a gift, that was less than two years old suddenly go black screen, only the power light lit and then 7 beeps, a short interval, and more of the 7 beeps (I thought I was in a vehicle backing up).  I took it to the store.  They didn't even open it up but looked up the beep code which says that it is a processor failure.  They handed it back to me and said that it would cost more to repair than to replace ... PERIOD (and more to retrieve any data).  I then found that in a matter of a few weeks since the new OS came out that there were just a few machines left with Windows 7, some being the last item on the shelf.  I was given a demonstration of Windows 8.  I nearly had a 'melt down.' It was overwhelming!!!  If you have any handicap, i.e. visual, it is worse.  But, that's just my opinion.  BTW, I checked online regarding the old laptop that 'died' and found that I was not alone, far from it.  I found a number of people with the same laptop a year to less than two years old that had the same sudden failure.  Some had replaced the processor without any change.  I was told that it seems to be a multi - component failure.  One upset person said that the company knew of the problem and was doing nothing about it.  I won't say which brand but I was not going to be a ding dong and go back to more grief and certainly not put up with Windows 8.  The advertisements are great ... but I did not find the reality good for me.  I never used a Mac before.  But, when I got it home, I looked at a few videos online and was using it without much difficulty in a short time.  Hooking up to my WiFi and wireless all-in-one printer was almost like talking to the Mac and telling it to hook up by itself.  What would have been a 'grand process' with a device using MS was a breeze for me on the Mac, the guy who never used a Mac before.

That should make this computer worthy of 5 stars.The ssd and extra ram are an option if you order directly from apple, but your definitely going to pay for it.  I think it was around 16 hundred bucks last I checked.

It's a solid laptop, and the aluminum body at least makes you feel like you've got something for your money as opposed to a plastic shell.  And I don't feel like I'm going to snap it in half on accident like the macbook air.I'm also thinking of taking out the optical drive while I'm putting in the new ssd.  I watched some video's it's not rocket science so if your comfortable with electronics you shouldn't have a problem.  This should make it a little lighter, but may void your warrenty (but not forever apparently).  If you need to get it serviced the guys at apple just told me to pop back in the optical drive before I get it serviced.  They definitely have good customer service, so that is always a plus.They said changing the ssd and ram doesn't affect the warranty at all so if your sketchy about removing the optical drive you can at least upgrade to the ssd and upgrade the ram and not affect your warranty.

Also networking PC's together for an amateur got difficult a lot of the time.

Pure genius. I have damaged several laptop jacks over the years because of either myself tripping over power cords, or people tripping over power cords. It might sound crazy, but the MagSafe power cod was my main reason for going to Mac. I am not sure when the patent will run out and PC's can get it, but it works flawlessly.Glass trackpad: Simply the best in the industry. Many companies have tried to duplicate it and they have all failed IMO. The trackpad on my last machine was horrible. Apple has it down with the many gestures, they all work flawlessly.Design: Solid aluminum, this is built like a tank.OS:X. Well I love it. Blows Windows 8.1 out of the water.The only downsides about Apple products is the price. But you do get what you pay for.

With such a machine, any audiophile or media person is practically assured of having a self-contained portable audio workstation, one that will record LPs, cassette tapes, FM broadcasts with a simple line (in my case, from an Onkyo receiver) to the \"Audio In\" of the machine, nothing else required.  Moreover, the presence of the two ports permits near-flawless capturing of any of the sounds emitted from a website or from the computer by attaching a simple patch cord between the two ports (I use an inexpensive splitter at the \"Audio Out\" port for monitoring purposes.  Finally, the built-in optical drive obviates the need to drag along an external drive, which can prove clumsy at best (taking up extra space on the desk) and mal-functioning at worst (I've never had a problem with an internal SuperDrive, but the external Apple Drives have failed with astonishing regularity, requiring all sorts of ingenious tricks to remove a stuck CD and often suffering damage in the process of removal).By contrast with this machine, the new iMac (and most of the other Macbooks) offers neither an optical drive nor an \"audio in\" port. Moreover, with the lack of an internal optical drive, I've forfeited two of the machine's USB ports--one to an interface; the other, to a burner--while attempting, with sporadic success, to import decent audio into the computer.  (At least, I've learned to purchase only external optical drives that have an eject button and a slide-out tray.  None of the non-Apple optical drives has presented so much as a single problem--and each has cost me under $50).I was among the first to purchase the unloved, scorned-upon Macbook Air back in 2008.  The first model had some costly problems (that problematic hinge!), but Apple withstood the flak (especially about the absence of an optical drive) and by 2010 came to market with not one but two Macbook Airs--an 11\" and  13\".  The criticism has waned, and now I'd be the first to recommend an Air for truly portable computing.  Unfortunately, what was once regarded as an aberration, then a curiosity, and finally a respected member of the Apple family, has now, it would appear, become the \"prototype\" for all Apple models.  I would expect the machine you're looking at to be the last Apple machine to come with the 3 features mentioned above.This may be a transitional time in Apple's history, one leading, moreover, to another consumer computing revolution and to a roaring comeback in Apple's stock price.  If people increasingly find CDs useless--even in their music collections--and if makers of ancillary products begin to show more products that might benefit from the added speed of US 3.0 and Thunderbolt (which is close to being all that remains of Apple connectivity apart from \"the Cloud\"), Apple could win big--really big.  But in the meantime, consumers who purchase, for example, a new iMac can only be left scratching their heads about how to make use of all those super-fast ports (USB 3 and Thunderbolt) on the back of their new machines, however ahead of the curve they may be.  At this point, the iMac has become less about practicality than bragging rights (\"look guys, mine has a Fusion Drive--just take my word for it\").", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Rating product", "Author": "Monica Ardon", "ReviewID": "RJFRJI8AZFI8S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": null, "Date": "March 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bought this to replace a 2006 Macbook Pro", "Author": "Eric Chang", "ReviewID": "R2YRZQ0ROTEJ78", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had to replace my old Macbook Pro not due to defect, but was rather unexpectedly smashed to pieces from a fall.I enjoy the speedier processor and better battery life, although I think 7 hours is a bit optimistic.

Boot time is super fast, around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute. Apps launch super fast, and the 500GB HDD is more than sufficient. I usually use my Mac for school work and internet browsing, so the entry-level 13\" MacBook Pro is already more than what I expected from a computer I would typically use it for. Macs hardly ever get viruses, and they are completely incompatible with existing Microsoft Windows Viruses. Furthermore, Mac OS X Mountain Lion's Gate keeper prevents the user from downloading malware and trojans, which keep your data safe and your computer running at optimum speed. The keys on the keyboard are evenly spaced and are back-lit, which make it easy to use at night and for speed writing (Typing?). Overall, the screen resolution, though non-retina, is sufficient for normal web browsing and work. I still don't get why retina displays are standard on most new iOS devices, but are only available on the MacBook Pro with Retina Display (Total cheapskate!). The thunderbolt port is awesome! It's 10gbps transfer speeds surpass even the super-fast USB 3.0 (Which also comes with the MBP). US 3.0 comes with the MBP and has transfer rates of up to 5gbps. Other ports include FireWire 800, Gigabit Ethernet, MagSafe port, Microphone jack. SDHC card reader and an optical drive for burning and reading discs.The glass track pad is large enough for Apple's highly acclaimed multi-touch gestures for scrolling through web pages with two fingers, zooming in on certain parts of certain apps by double tapping with two fingers, accessing launchpad by pinching with five fingers and using mission control by swiping up with four fingers.You can also buy one of Apple's magic mice, which connect to your Mac using Bluetooth, and also allows you to use certain multi-touch gestures such as zoom and scroll.For Windows users switching to a Mac, you can also enable right clicking (known to apple as secondary click) in the system preferences> Mouse and enabling right clicking.The unique to apple aluminium uni-body is a real beauty. It makes the MBP very durable and protects it from scratches, though you shouldn't go launching it against a wall for the sake of trying it.For Windows users who are used to using Microsoft Office, you can buy a license for the latest Microsoft Office software for Mac (Currently 2011) at any of apple's retail stores, Apple Authorised resellers, any store that sells Microsoft Office for Mac or downloading the software directly from Microsoft's website.*Users without an optical drive can skip the installation of Microsoft Office and head to the next section*To install the software, simply insert the disc provided in the package into the optical drive and open and install all the files.Enter your code printed on the back of your CD sleeve when prompted.Done! Enjoy using Microsoft Office!*For those without an optical drive (MBP with Retina Display and MB air), read this. Users with and optical drive can skip this section*To download Microsoft Office, go to Microsoft's website and download the trial version. When prompted, enter your code printed on the back of your CD sleeve to unlock the full potential of Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac.The Mac app store and iTunes store are phenomenal. The Mac app store is your one-stop shop for Mac software, though you can also download software online at your own risk. There are currently around 10,000 apps on the App store (and counting...), and billions of songs available for download fro the iTunes store. iTunes is also you default (And also your only) media player besides DVD player, or any other media players you may come across on the internet. iTunes is one of the better media players available on the market with it's simple to use User Interface. Users switching from a PC will definitely prefer iTunes to Microsoft's Windows media player.Overall, the high price of the MacBook Pro may convince users to buy a cheaper Windows PC instead. But remember, you are paying a high premium for a product with better build quality and high quality software, which is a joy to work with, considering that you can finally work in peace without having to worry about the millions of Windows viruses out in the wild attacking countless careless and oblivious PC users.

At the apple store I had the guy change the track pad so you don't have to click it, I can just tap it to open an app.The graphics are pretty good for someone who doesn't game a lot, if you're used to a lower end PC's graphics you'll be impressed by these graphics, although before I bought the mac I had a netbook and I was impressed by it's graphics too. If you haven't played with a mac in person, be sure to check one out somewhere if graphics are your tipping point. The screen is really nice, very clear and bright. The mac installed Microsoft office for mac with no problems. The only thing I would say that I don't like about the mac is that you cannot download more than one app at a time and it takes forever to download apps. I had to install Mountain Lion and it took a good two hours. I've noticed that if you close your open windows the app download time is less. The mac does get hot when it's charging, and when it's not it's still pretty hot (and I mean hot not warm.) Be sure to have good air flow where ever you put it.

If you're going to let a little one play with it make sure you set it on a desk so it doesn't heat up your baby's lap. I've read that the mac becomes cooler as it gets more broken in, but I have no proof of that yet. I would recommend to a friend if they can afford it, if not an iPad or an iPod touch really isn't too far off. Also if you're a netbook user like I was the macbook will seem kind of heavy, but I'm sure after carrying it to and from your destinations (school, work) it will seem lighter.  One more thing, this mac does NOT come with restore disks and I am not sure if you can make them direct from the mac like you can with newer PC's, also the charging cables are made of the same cheap material as the iPhone/iPod touch cables. In my experience with the iPhone, the charging cable became very frayed and I could see the wires and aluminum in the cord. WIth a seven hour battery life I would recommend keeping the charger in one spot at home and making sure your battery is full before you leave home, or buy a second cable for use at work or school. Maybe that will save the life of the cord and keep it from being frayed from too much movement. This mac does come with an extender cable and I'm using mine right now hoping the cable will stay nice for the many years I plan on using this mac. The part where the charger connects to a mac is a magnet and a strong one at that, be sure to keep your credit cards and cell phones away from it so it doesn't erase the data. I did read that in the fine print of the mac booklet. I might have read it incorrectly, but better safe than sorry right?Hope this helps!P.S. the camera DOES NOT look hot it does on TV! It's very pixely, I don't know if you can change the quality of the camera, BUT just a heads up. It may be because the room I use it in has poor lighting, but it could also be that the camera just isn't that good. What you see on TV is probably pre-recorded using a real camera. I didn't buy the mac for it's camera or FaceTime or any of that so it's not a deal breaker for me, but it could be for someone else.", "Date": "August 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great computer!", "Author": "Jonah Koonce", "ReviewID": "R35NQK186T3DK0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Out of all the laptops I have owned, this is by far the best!

Land", "ReviewID": "R1GZW1BW96QA2K", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I wanted to love this computer... I really did.  Apple makes a fine product but, I have had very bad luck with them, and they are simply over priced.  For me, If this computer ran fast, stable and efficiently, it would have been worth the cost.  However, this has not been my experience so I am returning this product.I first purchased my macbook off of amazon and it ran glitchy out of the box.  The trackpad was erratic and unstable and programs crashed out of the box.  I contacted apple who gave me the typical line \"well, you have to buy it directly from us to be sure it is good\".  So I sent back my macbook and went through all the trouble of getting a return.  I purchased a new macbook at the inflated apple cost and got my second computer.  I soon realized that I was having more problems that were related to the operating system.  For one thing, I bought this computer to edit movies.  iMovie was a laughably bad program which was non-intuitive and hard to learn.  I shelled out the money to buy Adobe Premier which is an awesome program that I was able to figure out without seeking help.  Unfortunately, this particular program runs very glitchy on a mac.... but wait, I thought these computers were supposed to run these type of programs better than a PC.On top of that there is a massive learning curve when you are switching over from a PC to a Mac.  I don't care was Apple says, Macs are NOT more intuitive then PC's... especially when organizing files.  I ended up spending hours on the phone with apple care to learn how to perform system functions that should be intuitive enough to figure out on my own.  Now, don't get me wrong... this is NOT apple's fault.  Macs are different from PC's and they take time to learn.  However, what IS apple's fault is that they only give you a 14day return window when you order a 1500+ product from them.  This is insulting and unacceptable and is the main reason why I am sending back my second Macbook.  If I was given a more appropriate return window, I likely would have stuck with it but apple is twisting my arm to return it while I can still get my money back.So in the end, here is my final point.  Apple makes a fine product.  However, it has been my experience that shelling out the big bucks for this product DOES NOT GUARANTEE that you are going to escape the headaches of dealing with a PC.  My experience was that I had spent three times as much for buy a product that included the same headaches as a PC if not more.  Keep this in mind when you are purchasing one.  In the end, I think it is better to buy this product from amazon because they actually have a BETTER return policy than Apple themselves.", "Date": "May 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not happy", "Author": "Tina Shuemake", "ReviewID": "REA39C19IG9SB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After one week the main board fried - I guess this happens, but not often.

The uptdate worked perfectly and easily I had no problums downloading or installing it it took a tad bit longer to update then my fairly new 27 in iMac but was still quick for a whole operating system. The next step for me is to install the 1141 songs and three movies I own on iTunes. For that much I was suprised how quick it went. It downloaded them all in about a hour or so while dowloding other apps lisining to internet radio seting up email ect. I have setteld into it know and it is working very well. I use it to do the average persone may do and maybe a bit more. I love the backlit keybord and suprisingly doesnt drain the battery that much and remains around apples 7 or so hours. If this is your second mac you will be suprised with how much power it has just like me it runs probibly faster than my imac (also mountain lion).

Often homework assignments require using a computer, which the MacBook Pro assists with because it provides Internet that can give information for research. In my opinion, Safari, the Internet browser that comes with the MacBook Pro is very fast and is extremely easy to use. As a result of having user-friendly features, Safari has a top sites page that contains frequently used websites. Also, in addition to top sites, there is unified smart search field that takes you right to the web page and fills in the entire URL when you enter a web address. MacBook's built-in sharing feature provides access to various web pages without having to leave Safari. By just clicking the Share button, you can choose how to send a web page by using Mail, which then gives you four options. Also the MacBook Pro has a fast performance that helps college students complete their work. The MacBook Pro provides many features, such as a dual-core Intel Core i5 that allows users to be able to take their laptops on the go. Also it has a 22-nanometer processor, cache, and graphics processor, and a fast 1600MHz memory controller on a single chip. Also applications like Aperture and Final Cut Pro help make work go smoother and faster because they automatically increase the speed of the active cores up to 3.7GHz. Hyper-threading technology allows two threads to run at the same time on each core and can get more jobs done. In addition to its high-quality features, it has an amazing new modern design that adds to the MacBook's overall easy usage. The new design contributes to assisting college students in need of getting work done because of its LED backlight technology that makes the display continuously bright. Also, on top of the screen is the built-in FaceTime HD camera that can be used to talk face to face through the laptop to loved ones or friends. The multi-touch trackpad is the button itself, which results in more room to click everywhere, which personally is nice because it is easier to double click when needed. Another valuable feature of design is the MagSafe Power Adapter's magnetic design, which is made to disconnect harmlessly from the port in case someone trips over the wire so it does not cause the laptop to fall. In conclusion, the 13-inch MacBook Pro is a wise investment for college students and any users interested in an easy-to-use productive laptop to help get work done.

I was finally done with high school and moving on to bigger and better things. All my life I had been striving for the best and getting my first laptop was not going to be anything short of the best. After my graduation party and selling my car, I finally saved enough money to purchase my first `real' life purchase. I knew I wanted a MacBook Pro since early senior year and now was the time that I was finally going to get it! I begged my mom to come with me to Best Buy to help me buy it. She didn't see the need to come with so I brought my sister. Checking and double checking that I had the right amount of money in my checking account I told the sales woman that I'd like to buy a MacBook Pro 13 inch. She gladly went to the back to get it and without hesitation I swiped my debit card. A screen popped up asking if I wanted to purchase insurance. Being the 18-year-old kid with only a new laptop on my mind, I stupidly said no thanks. After signing my life savings away, I walked/ran out of the store carrying my new `baby', just as the store was closing for the night. Getting home I opened the box and started to set-up and install all of the new and coolest things on my computer. At around 12:30 that night, after convincing my mom that Macs never had any problems and they were the best laptops around, my laptop completely shut down. It was charging so I knew the battery was fine, but it still wouldn't turn back on. Reluctantly I walked downstairs with tears forming in my eyes. How would I tell my mom that it wasn't working. After spending what seemed like days on her laptop searching what could be wrong, we decided to call the Apple helpline. They were dumbfounded, just as we were. They said that we must have gotten the `lemon' and that I should not have any problems returning it tomorrow for a new one. It was the longest night of my life. Waking up at the crack of dawn, we exchanged the `lemon' for a new one, as well as bought the highest amount of insurance possible.

An application I've been running on Wine in Ubuntu does not run on OSX. There's Virtualbox but not VMWare player. My favorite desktop editor Geany is not available on OSX and a lot of the better text editors are expensive.

It Did Get Better ~ But Really, Not Worth the Price", "Author": "Nu Mantra", "ReviewID": "R2ESY0I0FFOVTD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So where do I begin so that the legions of Apple critics and fans do not view this as support of their narrow views? I will say that I am not into the Windows vs. OSX argument - I do not think Apple is evil nor that they have, hands downs, the best products. I have had Windows desktops and one laptop - and yes - I had the typical problems with them that are often used as reasons for one jumping ship to Apple.I had said that my next notebook would be an Apple, but never really wanted to pay Apple's steep price. OPEN BOX is the way to go - I got 10% off a returned MacBook that looks to have never been used - the power cords had not even been unwrapped. Then - as a student and an educator - I was able to get another $100 off the price. Still, at nearly a grand after taxes, the cost was pretty steep when BB had PCs with similar or better specs for half the price.So, why stick with this? I want to find out for myself if this is worth the price and the hype.  I already knew that Apple's customer service is great, and that alone is worth maybe $150. I do very little on my comp - read the news, write some papers, watch a movie, play chess at Yahoo!, so I do not need it to be a power machine, I simply need it to work. And it does, very well, in fact. Processes are seamless -There is great integration of things like the email client, the Apple store, and iTunes - of which I have NEVER been a fan. I avoid iTunes on my iPhone at all cost - I use Media Monkey instead - But I can see how valuable it is on the notebook. I love how even the websites  and files can be viewed in cover flow.  Apple thinks of \"little\" but important things like using a charger that is magnetically help in place, so that if you trip on the wire, it disconnects, instead of sending your expensive computer crashing to the floor.  And the fact that I can dual boot was a big selling point, if only so that I do not have to spend $100 to get Microsoft Word, which I will need once I start school again in a few weeks.I have had my MacBook for exactly two weeks, and  I do enjoy it when I can use it, but I have not yet decided if I will keep it. This is because the thing gets so unbearably hot, that it becomes too uncomfortable to use. My first day with this, I set it up, started playing chess through the included app -I was not even online - and within ten minutes, I thought the machine would burn a hole in my pants! I turned it off and ran to my desktop to do some research. And wow - what did I find!Yeah - yeah - I get that Apple says the MacBook should not be used on laps- I get that I should go into Activity Monitor and quit programs that have high CPU - which are NONE - as I am doing very little on the thing in the first place. Yeah - I get that all of the Apple fans out there have this way and that way - some of it costing extra money - to try to help make my computing experience on the MB a more enjoyable one. But this is an experience I should have right out of the box! What other company makes a computer at this price that you cannot use for ten minutes without fearing you will suffer a burn? Now, before the fans come out and say, \"Take it back, yours is defective,\" I will remind you that this problem has been documented all over the Internet. I do not want to hear I should update to Mountain Lion. I have already done the research, and  some are complaining that their MacBook is running even hotter after the update. A co-worker of mine told me that he had a student bring a MacBook to him that had a battery so swollen that the chassis had separated by about 4 inches. Then I thought back to my own iPhone, which had to be replaced in January because of the same expanding battery issue; it split my phone's casing right down the back!How Apple sells these products (with consistent-enough overheating and battery problems) and gets the accolades they do is beyond me. Maybe it is because, other than these very serious flaws, they pioneer very good and exciting technology. You have the fans who will accept any ole shortcoming to remain loyal to what they think is a superior product. Then perhaps there are others who are in my situation, who for the most part really enjoy this MacBook and would love to spend more time learning and using it, but who experience discomfort in just trying to use it for basic computer tasks. This puts me on the fence, as I try to find solutions that do not require my having to dip into my pocket any more to use a computer that simply should not run this hot, especially at this price! If you do not mind the heat and/or are dedicated to spending more money to cool the MacBook, I say go for it.  Even if you are not, but you have been thinking of taking the Apple plunge, I say try the MacBook out for yourself so that you can come to your own conclusion about the overall quality and worthiness of  the MacBook.  As for me, I remain hopeful and very disappointed at the same time.  I soon have to make a decision about returning it, but I have to admit that I really like this machine so much now that the cost bothers me less and less everyday, but that heat... that is a whole different story!UPDATE -10/29/12After taking the comp in and meeting with the folks at Apple, the heating problem has simply resolved itself.  As someone on the Apple forums suggested it would, it just stopped heating up so much and so quickly.  For two months I have used the Mac - and for the most part have liked it.  However, it certainly is not worth this much money, not my money!  The novelty and mystique of the great Mac Book has worn off!There is just too much clicking I have to do to for basic functions like  minimizing a screen and finding files.  What takes 1 click on a Windows computer takes 2 on the Mac Book, what takes 2 on a Windows machine takes 3 on the Mac Book.  Sorry, but it DOES crash, and it crashes as much as any Windows machine I have ever used.  I do not like being forced to use iTunes.  If I had known beforehand that I could not download and use Media Monkey on this, I would not have bought this laptop.  I should be able to decide on the media management software that I want to use.  iTunes is not even very intuitive; rip a CD that is a compilation, and iTunes will not even rip it as ONE CD, rather as a different CD per different artist, and then you have to go in and correct all of the tags so iTunes can properly catalogue your music in its library, and then you have to tell the program to go back and find album art?  Who has time for this? Freeware is a whole lot easier and enjoyable to use, and allows you to use MY music the way I want to!  The Mac Book has stopped being fun for me, and I do not see what it has/does so much more/better than a PC to justify paying twice the price for half the specs of a Windows machine.I have not yet decided if I will sell it; this will be determined by how much I end up paying for a Windows laptop.  With Black Friday coming up, I should be able to get a good price, but if I end up paying more than $500, I will sell the Mac Book.  Never thought I would say that I am looking forward to buying a Windows machine, but Windows 8 is very enticing, at the moment.  The very good thing is that Apple products have great resale value, and my machine is only a few months old and is great cosmetic condition, as well as I have the latest Windows suite installed on it, so I should get a good price for it, if I do sell it.", "Date": "August 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Too early for Screen problems", "Author": "TD", "ReviewID": "RO6G2HGJNOLPN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i bought this item recently, i havent used it much yesterday when i switched on my macbook pro it attempts to start up i see the white screen, hear the sound, can feel the fans are onthe screen just goes to hibenate and doesnt come on for me to sign on to my mac. after a while it comes on and i am using it playing musicand the screen suddenly hibernates, music is still playing but i have no visual.for an item i havent used much and for what it cost, its too early to start giving problems", "Date": "August 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bricked after 2ft drop on carpet from bedside.", "Author": "Deimos \".\"", "ReviewID": "R34QRUOZQ1CK6O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "At the title says my pro (which I had running wonderfully with Windows 7 as primary OS as OSX was way to limited) fell off my bed (the cat rubbed against it and pushed it off) and it landed on the carpet.

Initially, I loved my 13\" Macbook Pro and vowed never to go back to PCs. With my new 15\" Macbook Pro, I still won't go back to PCs and in general I really like my Mac, but I no longer love it. I have the new 2012 edition with 750 MB hard drive and 8 GB of RAM. It's quite fast but doesn't seem any where near as fast as it should be based on its rated speed. RAM should not be an issue with 8 GB but it regularly runs out and I have to use 3rd party software to free up RAM, whether I'm editing photos in iPhoto or Aperture or running Final Cut Pro X. It seems that Apple should by now have figured out how to cycle RAM in a way that constantly frees up older allocations and keeps space open for applications being used currently. Seriously.Most egregiously, I'm really pissed off with how computer makers consistently lie about battery life. The 2012 MacBook, as with the few generations before it, advertises a 7 or so hour life under normal use. I find this unconscionably off the mark. My Macs have NEVER lasted more than three hours on one charge under even light usage (Word, web, etc.), and generally last about 2 hours new. This is so far from seven hours I don't know how it's legal to advertise seven hours.Conclusion: I like my Mac (and I really like my Mac desktop), but I expect a lot more from Apple nowadays. Three stars out of five. And I'd appreciate any tips (beyond the obvious) for increasing battery life or managing RAM.Update 10/6: I forgot to add that it gets REALLY hot, to the point where I can't hold it on my lap. This is far hotter than any previous MacBook or Air that I have had has gotten. Even the palmrest gets really hot.

Not only was it referbrished/used, but I was paying so much more than a brand new apple macbook pro would of cost. Got ripped off too. Yeah. I should've looked into that more, but I was right out of high school, so I didn't know much. And let's just say my old macbook pro is hunk piece of junk. Everything that went wrong with it did which I won't get too much into, but I wanted a replacement. PC laptops, I wasn't too crazy about, so I decided to go with an updated version of the Macbook Pro.I had to decide between the this and the Retina Display. I wanted the Retina Display one so bad. I think I wanted it mainly because it is thinner than the regular macbook pro, but did I really want to pay $400 more just for that. It did have other features, yes, but I won't pay $1400 for a laptop. I would do a $1000 for a brand new one though. Getting it in the mail is like Christmas! ALl packaged up securely and when I opened it, it was perfect.I had a 4-5 year old macbook pro. So there were some pretty big changes that I am still getting use to. The trackpad is a little confusing, it scrolls in opposite directions and you can click anyway in there. I think that's the biggest thing I have to use to. It is smaller in size, like weight like, I'm talking about. Love the black keyboard with the lighting. Finally I have photo booth again! I missed it. I am still basically messing around with it, but I remain in love with it.I have had my ups and downs with Apple products in the past, but honestly apple remains to be the best in my opinion.

I called Apple support, and after working with a Tier One advisor who was not very informed, I was escalated to a Tier Two advisor.This is my second experience in 20 years with Tier Two Apple support. The first in the 90s, the second in 2013. Both experiences are the best tech support I have ever experienced, by far. In this example, my router's firmware was old and needed updating. The advisor tried several things, then had me look at the router. He helped me update my router's firmware, even though my router is not an Apple product! Because that's what it would take to resolve my problem.I am not experiencing internet problems anymore. Apple has successfully turned a situation around from regretfully wanting to return my computer to being completely satisfied.I give 4 stars instead of 5 because of my experiences at the Apple Store and with the Tier One advisor. If they had taken me seriously, I would have been able to resolve the problem sooner.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I really want to give a good review. I had a mac in the 90s, back when only graphic artists and schools had them. It lasted for years, easy to upgrade.I cheaped out after that and bought several PC laptops, none of which lasted over 4 years. So, I decided to spend the dough and go back to a mac.I cannot maintain a wireless connection. Sometimes, it goes out every 3 minutes. Sometimes, if I'm lucky, I get as much as 20. Doing the research I, admittedly, should have done before purchase, I find that thousands of people are having the same problem.I have purchased a cheap wireless adapter, rather than do what the Apple store advised, which was to buy a new router (none of the other computers in my household have any problems). Hopefully, bypassing the mac's wireless capabilities will do the trick.But, that is pretty pathetic for an $1,100 machine, right? Plus, Apple seems to be in denial over the issue. They should at least be honest with their customers. Their own support forums are overflowing with people reporting this problem:[...][...][...][...][...][...]Like I said, I am far from a mac hater. I was really excited to receive this laptop, and I wish I could give it a good review. But wireless connectivity is mission critical. Sorry, Apple, this is a fail.

Apple has implemented an aberrant pricing policy that varies widely from the industry standard pricing policy for professional software.  Apple, in true corporate fashion, has made this change without warning or notice.  The new policy is NO PATH TO UPGRADE.  You heard me right.  If you pay professional software prices for a piece of Apple software, and two months later they release the new and improved package, you will be stuck paying full price for the upgrade.  Do you feel like you got a deal now?  You have now paid more for your software than if you had gone with the industry leading software package (PreSONUS, Adobe Premiere, CorelDraw, etc.) and next update, you will be well behind the pricing curve.  I do not have a problem with Apple software, but rather the sneaky way in which they implemented the pricing policy.

I suspect its fan is different it idles at 2000rpm.The CPU,  the difference isn't always apparent but does perform well so far and is noticeable watching videos. Ill need to play with it more before i can really say more. Originally I had interest in a MacBook air but didn't want to get an even weaker device than the base series pro,  since apples products are underpowered to begin with and I recall the AIR isn't user upgradable (unless I'm wrong?) I felt this model was best. And I could most likely upgrade ram to 16gb (still have to confirm this is possible on this release)Lastly battery sustains itself ever so slightly better.

Owning everything Apple owns, and having my older macbook side by side, and my new Mac Air beside it as well, and after endless adjustments in brightness and contrast, there is no doubt the screen used on the macbook pro non-retina is inferior to my MacAir and macbook.Apple uses Samsung and LG on their monitors on the same model, both in the Retina MBP and non-retina, but they dont advertise this fact. As of 3/19/2013 Apple is being sued over the 'secret' that MBP retina use either LG or Samsung, but you dont know which one youre getting until you notice bad ghosting on the screen (which is the LG problem, not found on the Samsung). Its sad that you 'roll the dice' on WHO made your monitor on two MBP exact same model and mfg. date. That is something Apple should've known would soon rear its head like a snake in the night.Foremostly I must comment that I own Apple stock, and own tons of their products and sing their praises to no end, as such I am not an 'apple hater' by any stretch. I am shocked at how fuzzy, and flat the screen is on this MBP, and wonder WHO made the monitor on this laptop, since you never know, and Apple isnt saying, and they wont tell you, nor is it indicated on the box WHO made the monitor, since Apple uses multiple suppliers for the SAME MAC models.I am returning this unit for a refund, the screen is rather painful to read and type on, ...and since I use 7 different computers, I am not 'addicted to one type of screen', and am adjusted to many, ...but this unit is painfully unbearable.Side by side, believe it or not, BUT TRUE, the speakers on my Mac Air crank out crisper and MUCH LOUDER at full on same tunes than this MBP does. This isnt subjective or conjecture is rock hard FACT. You would think just the opposite on the larger MBP, but thats a fact.Another minus is the squishy jello-keyboard touch, a really undesirable (generally to most who hate this) feature.Ive read a lot of INSANE comments by others rebuking others saying \"my mac air is better than this MBP\". Well heres two empirical facts, all the upgrades money can buy: SSD, mem, etc, WILL NOT change the 'stink-factor' of the screen on this MBP, or the squishy keyboard, OR the inferior speaker output.Yes, the optical drive is nice (no bluray, shame on apple for po-pooing optical drives), and the ethernet, but the mac air is about as lite as an ipad and does 90% of what this Mac Pro does,...so the math is simple.The only negative against this unit is the same as ALL Apple computers, that being Apple is insanely stingy on memory. There is not any Apple product that doesnt immediately need a Mem upgrade. Given the extremely high price of all Apple laptops etc, the pathetic lack of memory is morbidly sad.Barring the horribly bad screen, and nasty squishy keyboard feedback, the unit is fast and well built, but for its price, etc, the mac air is far far moreso a desirable product. Endless speed tests show negligible difference side by side over many apps and overloading between the two on a year older Mac Air.", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Battery doesn't last even 4 hours..", "Author": "Lautaro Carbia", "ReviewID": "R3ELG0XTH5ZLTC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "As i said, theres huge battery problems unresolved.

So what sucks about it?--Now when you scroll on a webpage more than two or three times, the page will begin scrolling EXTREMELY fast causing you to lose your place and have to backtrack to try and find it.  Scroll a couple more times and it happens AGAIN.  This is f'ing maddening.  What's even more maddening is that this has been forced upon us with no option to turn it off!  I've called Applecare about it multiple times now and I'm told it's a \"design feature.\"  WELL IT SUCKS!  Supposedly it's to mimic how an iPhone works?  I don't know, as I don't own an iPhone--but I do know one thing!  I DON'T WANT MY LAPTOP ACTING LIKE A F'ING IPHONE!!!--Rubber-banding effect on webpages.  This is where the webpage (or folder, etc) will stretch beyond its boundaries and then \"snap back.\"  Now this wouldn't be a big deal if the rubber-banding only occurred on the tops and bottoms of webpages, but Apple has also decided to implement it on the SIDES of webpages.  This causes webpages to slip and slide all over the f'ing place, making it extremely annoying when trying to read text while scrolling!  Again, no way to turn this \"design feature\" off!--Apple has also decided to change all the trackpad gestures, and not for the better.  AGAIN!!!!  No ability to revert them back to what they were in Snow Leopard.  Seriously--how hard would it be for Apple to simple offer an option to use the older, more familiar settings for these sorts of things?  I did manage to set my frontward/backward webpage settings to three-finger swipe like I'm accustomed to from SL.  Cool!  Ummm, too bad it barely works!  Half the time the trackpad is completely unresponsive when using this gesture.  How.  F'ing.  Obnoxious.I am racking my brain trying to figure out a way to get RID of this thing and go back to an older MBP running Snow Leopard (which was NEVER broken so I'm not sure why Apple went and tried to fix it!)

Clements", "ReviewID": "R1HPZO17IKV9J2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Let me preface this by saying I am a long time mac user. I've owned an iMac, Mac Mini, and now this MacBook Pro. All of which I have had great success with. However, apple isn't what it used to be. I've heard large production houses are slowly moving away from mac, but couldn't understand why. Now I know.First off, let me say that initial impressions of this were good, great look and feel, gorgeous display especially when calibrated, decent sounding speakers, and acceptable performance for 4gb RAM, a hard drive, and a dual core. It pretty much ends there.Over the corse of owning this computer (15 months), it has been to the apple store for repair 4 times, all relating to the main hard drive bay, the hard drive has been replaced twice, the cable once. I got tired of all of this shenanigans and decided to upgrade the thing myself. Bad move. While the hard drive and ram are considered \"user replaceable\" by apple, (they include guides on their website) replacing the hard drive is somewhat of a grey area and from what I was told if you break anything they will void your warranty and apple care. Replacing the optical drive is a huge no-no. I made the mistake of making it obvious that I had. I have a 64gb ssd in the hard drive bay, and moved the hard drive to the optical drive bay (who uses those anyway?). This was after my second visit to the apple store where the sata cable and hard drive had been replaced. This was working fine for almost a year, until roughly a week ago when I started to have the same issue I had before I went to the apple store, a grey screen with a circle and a x through it, indicating no boot drive. Turns out, the connection keeps cutting out. Go to the apple store, and it just works fine that day. That very night, I have the problem again. Take it to the apple store next day, stock and ready to go and I am informed that because I removed \"non-user-replacable\" parts, my $200 apple care was void. He then proceeded to tell me they couldn't even replace the data cable if we paid for it out of pocket, and that anything that would happen in the future I would have to pay for.$1400 on a laptop and they can't even support they crap they manufacture? I understand I replaced things I shouldn't have, but is all the crap really necessary? I returned it to stock and the issue wasn't even with the optical drive, but the hard drive. This is like buying a computer and a monitor and because you made an upgrade to the computer, the company saying they can't service the monitor. Complete crap. The fact that a company like this is riding on their reputation to carry them through everything and have to sue samsung to keep from going under is sad. The customer service for him to have the audacity to say it to my face that because I chose to upgrade something I own, they can no longer service it even if I pay for it has pushed me over the edge and I have listed every apple product I own on craigslist. Will be officially switching to PC, and never be buying from or recommending Apple to anyone again. No one should have to put up with this after spending that much money on a computer. They know they are a big company and that they don't have to care for anyone, just sell a cardboard box for several thousand dollars and refuse a refund.

Second let me say not really.I hate it so much I wouldn't even give it to you if I hated you.First I wiped this device and installed a clean version. Then I updated. You know the low cost updates Apple puts out. Seriously I had to leave it running overnight on the update.It has been nothing but problems. Every update breaks something and not I am not kidding. Mostly they break their own tools or apps.I updated the software on a clean install, then update iTunes, cool yeah. Wrong.  iTunes needs quicktime version blah blah error starts popping up. Only that version is installed and I'm not using iTunes.Then I update the OS to the newest version only to see its killed Cisco VPN permanently. I don't mean the client I mean it removed the parameters in networking to allow connections. And it broke the web version of Cisco Anyconnect which you have to buy and its not cheap. My Apple support friends at Boeing have asked me how I fixed it. I look on websites forApple and they are dumber than crowbars so I happen to see a 64 bit mentioned and I decide to search for a Cisco 64 bit client and install it. Works again only I am running 32bit OSX nice. Then I try to update again to the best yet from Apple low and behold I'm told to buy it from the store. Only I have to have the newer version to download from the store. Apple intellect at its best.After a phone call and some money I have a cd on the way.  I install the next version, setup a printer, setup office, configure email, and install a couple other items nothing major though.Installed updates 1GB worth and bam the printer is dead. Of course on windows you can delete, or change/view the network settings, and reinstall in a minute. On a mac you need another 1.5 GB install. The cool thing is how you download the installer and it expands it and moves the files to various other locations. Sheer genius to take a download file, extract it to a .pkg file, then scatter files all over the hard drive so you cant possibly just go back to the download location to reinstall.  Now I suppose their is some script I could run but I can't even find the install using Apple guidelines from the OS. Not even using the help from from forums.Anyone that says a mac is easy is lying. Every update you run the prospect of losing hardware settings, programs you bought may no longer work, and you might even have a paper weight.The issues I have had are not hardware problems. I installed another harddrive, installed Windows XP and no issues, wiped it and installed windows 7 and both were faster and more stable.If all your going to do is browse the web and use iTunes you might be okay other than that they are junk. I have built a non standard Windows 2008 server on a Dell desktop and had to hack network card drivers and it runs fine, wiped a virus off a kids pc, did a complete reinstall of Vista without drivers on an older pc and spent less time than on this mac. I have had it two months and its been used about 12 times,  I have ins talled windows XP\\windows 3.1\\95\\95\\windows 7 and updated thousands of times and even the worst pc I have had, has never given me this much grief. This is the reason MS sold 60 million copies of XP, over 60 million copies of Windows 7 and Apple has sold 3 million mountain lion operating systems. And Apple charges $15 and Windows charges between $100-$300 per copy.If you buy a new computer every 3-6 months Apple is for you. The first couple updates will render it a paper weight and then you can get a new one and they will give you an $8 trade in credit too! As for the folks at the store helping you I would say yes they will if you forgot how to plug it in. If it involves tech support you better hope you have some good diagnostic skills. I usedto think I did before I got this mac.I got this laptop for troubleshooting and to become familiar so I could assist others. It has taken more research than my degree and let me tell you it certainly has help me learn how to troubleshoot macs.Now I know why few vendors make software for macs.

Complete folly!  The bad experience started at the Apple Store.  I was told they could transfer data for me if I brought in my XPS.  \"For how long?,\" I asked.  \"Several days.\"  \"Not acceptable.  I have work to do.  What if I brought the two folders I want to transfer on an external drive?\"  \"Fine.\"  So I went home, updated the folders and came back.  \"Oh, we can only transfer from another computer, not from a drive.\"  So I purchased the computer and went home to set up and transfer data myself; I've never had any problems doing this in the past.  I get home again and go to archive and print-out my email receipt (which I need for an expense account).  The pdf would not open because of special Apple character sets and was just lines of splotches.  I went back a third time to the store to get a receipt.  The next day I opened the box and proceeded to set up.  After about an hour trying to work out how to assemble the two-piece power chord (no instructions) I got stuck on the data transfer stage; it could not recognize any connection to another computer or hard drive or flash drive.  I just decided I hated it and returned it for refund.  I remembered all my previous bad experiences with Apple: how terrible ITunes is, Apple library terminals on which it was impossible to back-page or scroll, and several lecturers I've seen humiliated because they brought their slide-show on an Apple, so could not connect to a digital projector (which apparently requires a mythical object called a \"dongle\" which no human has ever seen).  I have nothing good to say about Windows, but at least I've learned since the PC was invented to use its various iterations, and it can send emails, text, pdfs to other computers and be hooked up to a projector.
