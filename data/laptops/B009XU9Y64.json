I just got it today but my first impression is that Windows 8 is very bad... Not Toshiba's fault on the user interface. As far as the hardware everything looked decent and the laptop is light for its size and the screen is nice and bright at the store display. Nice keyboard feel but the track pad isn't great feeling because its textured and the track pad buttons are hard pressing. multiple clicks will hurt your fingers. The biggest disappointment are the speakers. These are the worst speakers available on a laptop. They sound like internal speakers from an old desktop PC. My iphone has better sound from its speaker. You definitely need headphones otherwise the hollow noise form the speakers is annoying. I wish I bought a higher spec Windows 7 laptop.", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent", "Author": "Jason", "ReviewID": "RVCI3KKPZJX5P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It's ok.

Klaproth \"BMW Rider\"", "ReviewID": "RCN13GRAIYQXB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "As I sit here writing this review, I am using the THIRD Toshiba laptop I have had to go back to get..the first one was this model, and the Wi-Fi just quit. Just stopped. nothing would make it start up again.It would only connect to the internet with a cabled connection. For a 400$ laptop, that is just unacceptable. Luckily, I had bought it at Office Depot, and they exchanged it without a problem ( it was 12 days old). I brought the second one home, and used it, loaded all the \"stuff\" I needed on it (not a small job) and it worked fine...for about 2.5 weeks.On start up, about 3 times out of 5, it would refuse to load web pages.The toolbar showed it was hooked into the network, and no troubleshooting program showed a problem. I restarted the unit, and it then worked. This started to happen a lot, so I tried hooking in a network cable, and sure enough, it worked fine...another bad wi-fi unit. I then traded up to the next better Toshiba ( i3 intel, 6 GB), hopefully it has a better wi-fi unit, and/or a better management program for it.I guess we'll see.I am very disappointed, Toshiba!", "Date": "April 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Toshiba Laptop C855D-S5351", "Author": "StealthNCC1701E", "ReviewID": "R1OXXSTVQWDGT8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very fast on start up an shutdown its great for watching DVD to blue ray movies.I bout a external blue ray player for my Toshiba and the screen looks great on HD movies 3d all so works on it i had a hp dv5t all so did blue ray this one looks brighter then it did the Toshiba comes with 4 gig of Ram and 650 gig HDD space iv had my Toshiba for about 4 months now i bout it at office depot where i lived and since iv had it this long its don every thing i needed it to do very well made laptop and its light to carry with u when u wana take it.Its good Amd Model laptop for the price.", "Date": "May 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Toshiba Statelite C855D-S5351", "Author": "danieldan", "ReviewID": "R3OMNDADPHJBEL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great Laptop, actually very fast when it start up, when I passed trough all the configuration it was simple and fast.Thanks it was a great deal.", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Disappointed", "Author": "A.", "ReviewID": "RNQ0VME4UKHWS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I must say that I have been a loyal Toshiba customer for 8 years. I have purchased three computers from them as well as various accessories. I must say that I was thrilled by my previous two laptops, one is too old to mention, and the other I passed down to my mother. No problems, peppy little things and no complaints. That is, until I recently purchased the Satellite C855D-S5351. The internet barely works, and by barely works I mean oftentimes it doesn't want to connect to the network despite full service; this is especially true after waking it from hibernation. I also detest the mouse pad because it is set up to function like a tablet, I suppose. I barely move my finger and it flicks from my desktop to the horrible Windows 8 tile screen (whatever it is called, it is terrible and impractical for a laptop.) And even worse, sometimes I have to hard boot the computer because it simply refuses to shut down. Games lag, and not heavy multi-player games like World of Warcraft either, but girlie games like The Sims.Even worse is the fact that Microsoft decided not to include a word processor. I mean, really? I have to have a word processor, there is no way around it and I did not appreciate being forced to fork over another $100+ for the privilege of writing papers and conducting my business. Terrible move, Microsoft.But the worst part by far is the screen. It has cracked twice, making it virtually unusable. And I do not abuse my laptop, I have never dropped it, nor do I stomp on it or hit it. My 10 lb dog decided to walk across it and it crackled like ice. I have never had this problem in the past, and at one point I was rather rough on my computer, taking it back and forth to college, it would sometimes get squished against books and the like, and I have never, ever had this problem!Forever the optimist, I assume that it is a flaw in this particular design and I will eventually purchase a new one (you know, when I can save up for the overpriced product) and hope that Toshiba wows me, otherwise, I am going to find another brand, another product, something that will hold up to normal use and the plight of tiny animals.", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Actually, this laptop is garbage and a complete waste of money", "Author": "Goosta", "ReviewID": "R35XK0PMH3BBE9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I retract my previous review. This low-end Toshiba is, well, low-end. I've owned it for about three months and my keyboard is already worn out. The a and s keys consistently fail to register and require major force to work at all. I don't even use it regularly.The speakers are garbage, sounds like something from the 80's. Only the most minimal audio is achievable with them and sounds are often indiscernible because of overload.The other day my laptop fell off the side of my bed, which is like two feet high. Now all sound doesn't work. Nothing. No sound at all. Its pathetic. If I watch a youtube video on loud volume, it will sputter and make screeching noises intermittently. I've had an entire computer table collapse on an old E-Machine before and nothing was wrong with it. I've banged and banged on a Compaq laptop before because its harddrive was worn out and it still performed all of its basic operations afterwards.", "Date": "March 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Laggy, clangy, freezing garbage", "Author": "Bekka", "ReviewID": "R35HDRNZFAT87P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Speakers: garbageKeyboard: garbageProcessor: mediocreAfter a few months, the computer now really bogs down when starting up.
