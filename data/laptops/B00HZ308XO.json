Out of the box easy to start and get up and running.  Not excited with the 30 day Office program, so I opted for the program I had to load on three home computer products.  Loaded well and runs sweet.  Hooked up quickly to my I phone for hot spot away from router operation and works flawlessly.  My recommendation is to buy and enjoy, haven't considered upgrading the ram yet but we'll see.", "Date": "February 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Think Twice Before Buying, Do Some Homework", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "R3GL0LR8UX86XU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My rating is strictly based on experience with Tohisba, not the vendor of this hardware in this particular case.Was ready to take the plunge and buy two of these units but have since changed my mind because you cannot get reliable assistance from either Toshiba's Customer Support and/or Technical Support.  Their telephone reps and email inquiries do nothing but bounce you between other departments.  In the end, my simple questions remain unanswered either from web searches, the product website, Customer Support and/or Technical Support.  Perhaps an existing owner can help us here.Saw the product in the store, specs look decent and pricing is reasonable.  However, don't want buyers remorse post-sale.The product website ([...]) does not answer my basic questions:Is the original 6-cell rechargeable battery non-replaceable or replaceable?Memory modules (expandable from 4 to 16 GBs):Is the original DDR3 PC1333 upgradeable and compatible with PC1600 modules?Is the original 4 gigabytes one memory module or two-appears this unit has two memory slots?Is the original memory CAS latency 9 or 11?FYI: some laptops include non-replaceable rechargeable batteries.  Not all memory is compatible and some laptops won't boot-up using CAS latency 9 modules.  These are important considerations if you want to improve and maintain your investment in the future.  Four gigabytes of memory could limiting in these units--depending how you use them.Thinking I'll stay with current HP product line, continuing research, not in a rush to replace existing laptop.Update on 02/20/2014.  Spent a great deal of time tracking down these details since Toshiba ignored my email to them.  For those buying this unit, like my sister, and interested in having a replacement battery and/or increasing memory, it appears Toshiba 8GBs is p/n PA5104U-1M8G; Crucial offers 8GBs PC1600 CAS 11 mods p/n CT5166199.  Kingston offers 8GBs PC1600 p/n KTT-S3CL/8G.  Orig 6-cell battery appears to be p/n PA5110U-1BRS.Had hands-on in a retail store, nice feel to touchscreen.  They also had model C55dt-A5106 with same specs as A5305 so don't know the difference between them.", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00HZ308XO"}}
