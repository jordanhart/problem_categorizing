The one that came with it is a form of Linux I had never heard of before.  Don't even try to use it.  My intent was to install CentOS Linux and that went without a hitch!Other than the price, there is not really anything else truly remarkable about this computer except the lighted keyboard.  I love it!  You can type in the dark.  You have lots of function keys that do all sorts of things such as turning the keyboard illumination on or off, disabling the track pad (This is necessary when you are typing because if you accidentally let your fingers touch it it moves the cursor and messes up your text.  I leave mine turned off all the time and use a wireless mouse)The only regrets is that it only has two USB ports and they are hard to reach in the back.  (And one of them is always in use because of the wireless mouse)The bottom line.  Buy it if you are able to install another Operating System .", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00BWADX60"}}
