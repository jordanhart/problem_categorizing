Westendorf", "ReviewID": "R3QTG5HBSSXTGY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Sony's VAIO Z-Series laptops are great in a lot of ways: compact, decent battery life, and great for travel work. The area that they fall down, however, is driver support. Sony refuses to let you install generic drivers for their hardware, and does not push out regular updates to keep pace. For example, my video card is an Nvidia, but the Nvidia drivers will not install because Sony has asked them not to allow it. I confirmed this with both Nvidia and Sony support. The video drivers are 2 years old for my card and really hinder the legs of the product.I would definitely not recommend any Sony product with \"custom\" hardware that does not allow regular driver updates from the manufacturers.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Macbook Air like PC but with gaming potential", "Author": "Joshua Welker", "ReviewID": "R18ONOYP756AV9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got this as a replacement for a macbook air.

The Sony Z2 delivered and I'm very happy with this premium ultraportable.Pros* Gorgeous 1600x900 screen, very bright and crisp.* Full-voltage, Sandy Bridge i5 processor.* Excellent battery life, ~4.5 hours with heavy use.* Only 2.5 pounds!!!* Dimmable backlit keyboard* Full size Ethernet, HDMI & VGA ports.* Boots up in under 20 seconds, programs open instantaneously.* Speedy 64GB Samsung SSDs in RAID0. Although these drives are only Sata II (3 Gbit/s) this RAID setup is very fast. A 50MB CrystalDiskMark bench delivered 576 MB/s reads and 322 MB/s writes.Cons* Speakers are a joke, the laptop sounds like an old alarm clock. Sony includes a pair of noise cancelling earbuds to address this problem, but I'm surprised they put such horrible speakers in their high end laptops.* Fingerprint magnet* Small trackpad. Sometimes misses multi-touch gestures.* Keyboard travel a little shallow* Major bloatware! 116 processes and 46% of RAM running out of the box. I disabled all Sony and unnecessary programs/services from starting and I'm down to 67 processes and 29% RAM after booting into Windows.Windows Experience IndexProcessor  6.9Memory  5.9Graphics  5.7Gaming graphics  6.2Primary hard disk  7.8I've had the laptop for three months and I'm very happy with it. I considered the Samsung Series 9, ASUS Zenbook  and the Apple MacBook Air, but neither one had all the features I wanted. Not to mention they all use low-voltage processors. The performance of this laptop is on par or better than many high-end 15\" laptops and it's only 2.5 pounds! If you can live with sub-par speakers I would recommend this laptop.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Adam", "ReviewID": "R3ANF50IUH1PJY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The laptop is everything it's advertised to be.Pros:FULL 1080 HD SCREEN!HD webcamMy configuration (default processor and 4gigs RAM) scores a 5.9 on Windows Rating.

I had technical problems with both, under warranty, and both problems were promptly fix by Sony.  However, my company work laptop is presenting the same problem again, which requires a completely new screen (and now warranty has expired).  This laptop had very good performance when new, but I can few performance deteriorating over time.  If you expect portability, forget about it.  You need to power on your graphics card to get better performance, and power may not be available all the time.  And this is a problem too when you need to go from one room to the other, as you need to disconnect your graphics card from power.  So, Sony never more.

Wadhwa \"krw2000\"", "ReviewID": "R2WOT7U4S2W6I7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have been buying Sony Z Series Laptops for almost 5 years for my company.  These are high end laptops usually greater than $1500  and depending on configuration beyond $2000.  We have had recurring and unequivocal repair problems with almost every single purchase we have made.  I would highly recommend a different brand.  Their support leaves much to be desired and their repair services although professional should be UNNEEDED in the first place.For example, one laptop purchased in Jan 2010 for $2200 had a faulty WLAN card in May 2011.  This was of course beyond the one year warranty.  After much headache and time consuming efforts at support and repair, I paid $500 for repairs.  Now in Jan 2012, this same exact part has become faulty again.  Of course this is past the 90 day repair warranty!  If you are going to buy a high end laptop from Sony, please be sure to buy extended warranty or consider other brands.  I gave this review one star because during the times when the machine was working, I was mostly happy with its performance.  However, the repair headaches have certainly cost Sony this customer.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "GREAT LAPTOP FAST BEST GRAPHIC CARD FOR A COMPUTER THIS SIZE BATTERY LIFE IS AMAZING", "Author": "natef50", "ReviewID": "R2KV2F88XZDXVM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "GREAT LAPTOP FAST BEST GRAPHIC CARD FOR A COMPUTER THIS SIZE BATTERY LIFE IS AMAZINGREALLY ONE OF THE VERY BEST LAPTOPS I HAVE EVER USED OR SEEN", "Date": "September 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "total disaster", "Author": "christoph nielson", "ReviewID": "R2U8OXPSMJJXER", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this computer two years ago.

It has functioned better but the screen developed black lines several months ago.  I was traveling and wasn't in a location for onsite repair.  In view of the weeks required for a factory mail in repair, I called and asked if onsite repair would be ok in a month... which was shortly into the extended warranty.
