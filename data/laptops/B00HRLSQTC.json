{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Laptop", "Author": "DV", "ReviewID": "R2UJCVX6SV8096", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got my laptop from Costco and I think after shipping and tax, it was about $730-750.  Can't remember the exact price without going to my receipt.  It came from TN and so far I like the laptop.  It replaced my Sony laptop, which I loved mainly.Other people have complained about the keys not being backlit, but I don't really care because I don't have to look at the keys when I type and I've honestly never had a keyboard in my life (laptop or otherwise) that was backlit, so no biggie for me.I notice that laptops, not just Dell, have raised keyboards.  I guess that's to help with spills and stuff whereas the old keyboard it would fry it (spills that is).  The Laptop seems to be performing great so far.  I got the laptop at the beginning of January and now it's 3/19/14, so about 2.5 months.  So far, happy with it.It came with Windows 8, but for my work which needed encryption and some other things that Windows 8.1 Pro has, I needed to purchase that.  I was coming from XP, so it was a huge jump to go from XP to Windows 8.  I ordered 8.1 Pro upon receiving my laptop and had to wait several days to get it to install it.  In the meantime, I was adjusting to Windows it.Thankfully I have an iPhone that got me used to some of the touchscreen motions, which helped a whole lot when adjusting to the touchscreen.My laptop normally just sits on my desk with a fan under it, hooked up to a 2nd monitor and all the USB ports are taken.  There are 4 USB ports (you can never have too many ports.  3 are on the left side of the laptop and one to the right side.  I wish the right side had 3 USB ports, too.  I'd use them up, too.Since this laptop can interface with HDMI video, I had to buy a new cable that goes from HDMI to HDMI.  My Gateway monitor has HDMI, VGA and a couple other things, I think.  I always have the battery in and it's always plugged up to electricity, which I learned is not good for the battery.  It diminishes it's life.  Dell has a feature that makes it so it's not constantly charging, but only when it needs it to save on battery life.  I like this feature that I did not have on my old Sony Vaio.It seems Dell has done a good job with cooling of the laptop and it doesn't seem to overheat like my old Sony Vaio, which cooling is a huge issue of those Vaios.It was really easy to plug in all my stuff like my wireless mouse and keyboard to interface with the Dell, as well as the Gateway monitor, once I got the right cable (got it inexpensive at Target with my 5% Red Card), and wireless Brother 4:1 printer.  All works well there.The laptop runs quiet and it goes to energy saving mode after a little bit if not being use.Now for the Windows 8.  It was quite a switch to go from XP to 8, but I made the transition well.  I heard all these complaints, but honestly, I love it.  It has greater beefed up security, though, this can be a super pain, but it is added security.  I found you have to have a hotmail account and link it to your log in to the laptop.  I forgot the password to hotmail and what I didn't realize was I setup the laptop with the wrong email address.  How I managed to mistype my email that I've had for over 13 years is beyond me, but I did.I called Microsoft technical support quite a few times and none could figure it out until the last guy.  What a stressful thing.  I don't know that if you forget your password that you can get on your laptop at all and Microsoft can be helpful or not.  We had premium service on our laptop, so it didn't cost us anything for the multiple calls and hours we were with them online and on the phone.Oh, and if you like the look and feel of XP or Windows 7 (I've never used Vista, so I cannot say), there is an external app that you can download called Classic Shell that allows you the start and menus and stuff like Windows 7.  LOVE, LOVE this!  It's freeware and I was happy to download it.I didn't care for the HUGE HUGE list of applications, which overwhelmed me.  I would have liked to have seen Windows 8 or 8.1 Pro have like a Menu Tree instead of seeing every single fricken application.I also love that you can have settings for multiple users with a broader range of control than in prior Windows version.  I think if you lock yourself out, there should be an easier way to go through some backdoor if you have administrative rights and reset.  But, I guess the purpose of them doing this way was to make your password stuff not specific to your laptop, rather to your hotmail account.  But the problem I see is if you get hacked, then what happens?I'll try to update this review later this year and see if I still love this laptop, which I hope I do.Oh, and I also wish you can just put the CD or DVD in the slot rather than have the DVD tray pop out.  I'm always afraid I'll break this, which I did on my Sony.", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Grrr.. mousepad", "Author": "Natalie Mirick", "ReviewID": "RQ1DBKH3SLZ21", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Computer looks very good, sturdy, etc. Processing is great.. everything is pretty good, as promised.. but good lord, I've wanted to throw the computer across the room seven times in the past hour alone due to this freaking mousepad. Half the time it works perfectly. Then it decides not to. Then it decides that only the outside edges want to work. Then it decides to click random things. Then it decides to jump across the screen. Then it decides to go super slow. Then it decides to go super fast. So annoyed with this mousepad. Buying an old fashioned mouse to go with the computer, then we'll see.", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Laptop Ever", "Author": "shamshad ali", "ReviewID": "R9PHY14KFHI0P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Seriously. you won't be disappointed.

Was in perfect condition and delivery was very fast.  The Laptop looks solid and has a nice alluminium finish. The only downside is that it has no backlit keyboard, specially if you work at night.Overall it is fast enough, maybe it takes a little more than what I expected when you restart it or turn it on.  Besides this, it lets you  multitask smoothly. In my case I was installing software, running an statistical software and at the same time had many tabs open on the internet and never expirienced it going slow. Windows 8.1 is very intuitive, however it takes a while to get used to it.I also have tried the 365 Office trial and works fine, maybe sometimes its kind of slow but not sure who's to blame.", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works great so far", "Author": "Evan", "ReviewID": "R3PZI6DW5N80YO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace an old Inspiron that was about to break in every way possible (blue screen randomly, one screen hinge broken).  This computer fit the bill in terms of specs and price.  It's nice that this replacement can use the same charger (although different battery), but it feels so much lighter that I am thinking that it won't take the wear and tear as well as the old one.I haven't run any kind of demanding games/programs on it and probably won't anytime soon.  Without a dedicated video card it won't do very well with the latest and greatest games/graphics programs.The keyboard is okay; it's odd to have a number pad to the right, so the hand placement is still new to me.  The spacebar requires a very firm press which is really annoying, but is probably specific to the one I received and not a problem to the entire product line.  Overall I'm pleased with the computer for the specs and price.", "Date": "June 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Malware", "Author": "Barry P. Jefferson \"Barry\"", "ReviewID": "R31UDLJDKZRZ0X", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This review is for two Dell laptops - one 15in and one 17in - purchased within a couple of weeks of one another. I honestly didn't know what rating to give. Now that the issues are resolved the machines seem to be really great, but the road to get there was tough enough to have me avoid Dell for future purchases.The 17in machine had a bad space bar key that didn't click consistently. I discovered this late and was afraid that I would have to send my now fully loaded machine off for repair, but the good news was that Dell was able to send me a new keyboard and tell me how to install it. Any computer can have a defective part so I don't hold this against Dell. My only complaint here is that some of the support technicians didn't have the information to guide me correctly. I am a computer professional so I was able to work through this, but it would have been tough for someone not experienced with computers.Now for the core of this review: I noticed within about a week of setting up my wife's laptop that the browsers started showing suspicious popups prompting to install questionable software and drivers. Over time it got worse and I Googled the URLs involved. I soon realized that the machine was infected with the asrv-a.akamaihd.net malware. Fortunately I was able to find some excellent information on the internet that led me through its removal. After several hours and the download of three malware removal tools, I got this machine under control. The malware had infected the browsers, the registry, installed programs, and multiple files on disk.I am pretty careful in my internet and downloading habits, so I couldn't understand how I had pulled in this malware. After many hours of cleaning up my wife's computer I was feeling a bit rattled but relieved that I seemed to have the issues resolved. Then I went and took a closer look at my own new Dell machine only to discover that it also had the same malware. A couple of hours later along with the use of the same tools, I again seemed to have resolved the issues. At this point I became suspicious that the problem was not caused by something I had done. Remembering that my neighbor had also purchase a new Dell laptop within the past month, I gave him a call to compare notes. Sure enough, he not only had the same malware, but his situation took a turn for the worse and he is now trying to deal with additional complications that spawn from it.Since dealing with these issues I have spoken with two Dell customer support technicians and one supervisor. I told them that if they satisfied me that they had found and dealt with the issue that I would not write this review; that obviously hasn't happened. Two of their technicians suggested that I perform a system restore operation. This would wipe the active partition from the hard disk and restore it to the image that it had when I received the machines. I tried to explain that this would not only wipe out days of work in setting up the new machines, but would also restore the malware that I had successfully removed. I don't think they really understood this.If after reading this review you want to proceed with a Dell purchase, then I recommend you Google asrv-a.akamaihd.net to see what you might be facing. Hopefully, this review and the Dell technicians I spoke with will communicate a wakeup call to Dell senior management so that no one else faces this issue in the future. Dell has always been a highly reputable company so by the time you read this it may be a problem of the past. I certainly hope so.Please reply to this post if you have information to add. If I get a satisfactory response from Dell, then I will gladly remove or revise these comments.", "Date": "June 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great buy", "Author": "Russell knorr", "ReviewID": "R1K4FH5KVF2CUM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Only had it 3 days ,spent the time getting used to Windows 8.1 ,This is my first use of win 8,0 or 8.1.so far the hardware has been spectacular.This unit is a member of the 5537 family ,per Dell support.Price and power the best I could find,Would recommend it to family and friends.", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Crashed and died after less than two months", "Author": "PPF", "ReviewID": "R9MW7Z2543RIR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this computer it exactly 2 months ago today.
