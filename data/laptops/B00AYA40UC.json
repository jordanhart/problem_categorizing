I have an older HP and always liked the design. This new one is very sleek looking and is very fast. Although I agree with the design with the arrow buttons, it isn't a big deal to me because I don't use them that often. The battery life on mine is very good. I can use this laptop for a good 3-4 hours before it needs to be plugged in again. I have taken it out on the road several times and have had to log on to public wi fi with no problems at all. I have been in situations where I couldn't plug it in, and have been able to get all my work done while just sitting having coffee in a fast food place or coffee shop. This is a great lap top for my needs.", "Date": "April 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value and great features for the prive", "Author": "Willard K.", "ReviewID": "R1R3AGPVX8BKA5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is competitively priced and offers a lot of features in a very thin and easily portable format.  I like the full QWERTY keyboard with the calculator stype numeric keypad on the rightside. HP made a good compromise by dropping the internal optical drive to keep the size small.I found the need for an external optical drive only a minor inconvenience as most media and softwares are downloadable.

Poor support", "Author": ":)", "ReviewID": "R2AI71ECBL1C9N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When you purchase a computer, you buy a whole package. The tech support is an important part of the package. In my experience, the HP support was a big disappointment.My new laptop was sleek and beautiful indeed, but the touchpad didn\u2019t work.  So I googled and read the forum and tried to fix it myself. I reset the machine, re-configured touchpad driver, updated Bios, but nothing worked. Based on my research, it seems the touchpad problem is common (then why didn\u2019t HP fix it?).So I contacted the HP support assistant for help. The first technician (his name is Azhar) closed my case while I was still typing and left me flabbergasted. I still remembered the last sentence I typed was, \u201cWait, what about the mouse app you just asked me to open?\u201d I lost the chat with the second technician after he (or she) instructed me to restart the laptop. He said he would wait for me for 5-7 minutes and I should come back to continue the chat with him. The restart process took more than 5 minutes. So I lost him. The third technician was nice and told me he would definitely help me to fix the problem. But I lost the communication with him too after a hard reset and problem was still not fixed.I went through three technicians in three hours. I politely greeted and answered the same questions over and over again. I told them what the previous tech asked me to do and the tasks that were unfinished. Each one of them ignored what I said and asked me to do different things. The first technician didn\u2019t even have an idea on how the touchpad supposed to work.I liked the look and price of the laptop, so I ordered a replacement. The new one arrived in just two days, but the touchpad didn\u2019t work either. I knew this is a minor issue and I just needed to do some minor adjustment to get it going. Since the HP support assistant was non-responsive on the replacement. I download the software from HP and got their phone number and called them this time.  It took me about 10-15 minutes to finally talk to a real person. He asked me to keep tapping the touchpad on/off switch until it worked. I tried multiple times but it didn\u2019t work. Then the reception got terrible and I lost the communication, AGAIN. I have never had a bad reception in my house, but I guess I do if the call was routed to India.I decided to return the replacement and I will never buy another HP product again due to its poor support.", "Date": "May 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great mid tier laptop with light gaming....", "Author": "Ron", "ReviewID": "R3HP63C6OJF1VF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Lightweightsmallnot quite a sleekbook but much slimmer then standardDoes not overheat when I play Skyrim or Star Trek Online", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "Ann from Pgh.", "ReviewID": "R12X4XOH2HJ8NF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "One morning I got up and opened the computer and the screen was damaged.  I called their help line and described the damages and they said I must have pinched it when I closed it.  Nothing can be seen on the screen at all..just a bunch of lines and a dark spot in the corner.  They told me that kind of damage is not covered in the warranty.  I have only had the computer 2 months.  For them to fix it was almost as much as I paid for the computer.  I have owned 3 Dell computers and never had a problem with screens.  Perhaps I did unknowingly damage it but it must be a very fragile screen.  I think I will stick with Dells from now on.", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good laptop for not being a mac", "Author": "Heather Moody \"Heat\"", "ReviewID": "R1XTES7KY2LKNX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good laptop for the price.

Saw this one and the same day I went and bought it. I am very pleased with it. I wasn't sure if I would like the windows 8 but I actually really enjoy it. It is very easy to understand and use. Especially with the touch screen. The touch screen makes all difference as I don't think I would have liked Windows 8 otherwise. The touch screen and the touch pad both respond really well. This computer is also very fast. From what I have noticed also the sound is also pretty good. Don't really have any complaints about this computer. Possibly the only complaint is that it doesn't have a cd drive but I can always get an external drive so that isn't such a big issue. I would definitely recommend this computer if someone is on a budget and wants a touch screen.About the keyboard, another reviewer mention he didn't keyboard's enter and arrow keys layout, I disagree.  The keys feel and look great.  What I like about the arrows keys is the right and left arrow keys are as big as standard size keys. I have another laptop and all the arrow keys are small.", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "aly bryant", "ReviewID": "RUYDD7V5UIMOS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was up set to have my laptop for a short period of time and windows 8 program already crashed now I have to pay 100$ before I can even use it!", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Already experiencing problems", "Author": "Bonnie Odette \"Lady Rider\"", "ReviewID": "R6NIL5M6IRLO8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Good:  Right out of the box, this computer fulfilled all of my expectations.The Bad:  After less than 2 months, it needed to be sent in for repair.The Ugly:  Read \"The Bad\"; really????
