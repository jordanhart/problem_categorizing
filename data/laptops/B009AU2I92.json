{"Reviews": [{"Title": "So far so good", "Author": "MJ", "ReviewID": "R24Q2HH1VICN7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Using this laptop for basic uses, email, web browsing, itunes, etc.  Got this to replace an 8 yr old Dell Inspiron that took a nose dive.For my purposes, this laptop's performance is great.  Everything seems to run smoothly and quickly.  Still getting used to Windows 8 though.  The screen display is pretty nice as well.This laptop is also VERY lightweight and thin (when closed).  This makes it feel a little on the cheap side, with plasticy surfaces and the keyboard strokes feel kinda light and the keyboard itself flexes (touchpad is nice though). Since I'll use this mainly as a desktop, my intention all along was to set this up with a nice monitor (25\") and wireless keyboard and mouse, so these aren't a big deal to me.One other thing: my laptop came with a single dead pixel in the very top left corner.  I can't see it at all unless the screen is totally black, so I don't care enough to send it back (plus I'll be using solely the external monitor)Overall I think this is a very nice laptop with solid features that should satisfy anyone with basic needs.  The laptop looks sleek and modern, but the weight and mechanics of the keyboard downgrade it a little bit, making it feel a little on the cheap side.  I was able to buy it directly from Amazon for $450, so for that price, can't complain at all.  If you're considering paying retail ($700), you can probably find a more upscale laptop for that $$$.", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent purchase", "Author": "Harish Chopra", "ReviewID": "R1RNQHT57NUMVN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this product probably a month back and it's amazing. Everything is good in this product except the HP automatic alarms for updates or something. it annoys sometimes.. otherwise the product is good to be used and it's not too expensive to buy. Windows 8 works good on this product.I would recommend this to my friends and family since its sleek n wide design is hard to be found in many other systems.Cheers !!", "Date": "March 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "stay away..", "Author": "Jason Kirk", "ReviewID": "R3TTM2FNGQMQJD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this from a different retailer.

The keys feel very cheap and have to be pressed in the right area for the keypress to be registered. For example, if you press the right most side of the space bar down , it will not register the space.It's also sad how HP comes bloated with un-necessary HP software.I ended up returning mine and instead going with a Lenovo Z585.  The keyboard and chassis build feels a lot more solid.", "Date": "March 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not What I Expected!", "Author": "Donna Evans", "ReviewID": "R1JRM5DFR0U0OG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When I got it back in May of 2013, it WAS the best laptop ever, unfortunately, I have had to return it TWICE for repair. First, HP employees did not send my laptop in customer service sequence as they should have. They replaced the motherboard and sent it back to me. The second time, I returned it, they sent it according to sequence, but it still froze upon the next day returned to me. I finally am requesting a full refund or send me something that is similar or better. After spending a month in the hospital for what I though was a simple foot infection and upon release finding out I NOW have renal failure, this too much of a headache. Two thumbs down, HP!", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Bad but could be better value", "Author": "crystal g owonubi", "ReviewID": "R16ECAJUZP65YG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just bought a few units of the SleekBook and was immediately impressed by the design and lightweight of the laptops. The keyboard material and surface seem a bit cheap for this system. I was also a bit disappointed that it didnt come with a DVDRW insert. i guess i had overlooked that in the spec sheets. Overall i would give this product a 3.5 star.
