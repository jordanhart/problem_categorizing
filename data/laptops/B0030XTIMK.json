I don't do gaming.  This laptop fit the bill in nearly ever respect, but I was quite disappointed by the short battery life.  It seems to discharge at a rate of about 1% per minute, so that gives 1.5 hrs of on-battery use.  Yeah, you could extend the uptime by dimming your display but that makes it quite difficult to read.  I'd say, if you want this laptop, plan on spending from 75 to 150 more for a 12 cell battery - prices vary depending on if you get it from HP or aftermarket.Lots of people have commented about the metallic touchpad but I don't find it an issue.I love the touch sensitive volume control and mute button.  Very handy, no fumbling around looking for the right key or key combo to adjust volume or mute.Lightscribe works as advertised, kinda fun to make CD's and label them, but it does take a while (5-10 minutes).I was tempted to give it just 3 stars (It's OK) vs 4 (I like it) and decided on 4 due to the value delivered.", "Date": "April 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Worst choice ever", "Author": "Mr Gradenko", "ReviewID": "R29D3DY5AVA02Z", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop a year ago, and I regret it with all my heart. It just died, for no reason; never fell down, never spilled water on it, it just died. I wish I could give it five stars, since it was really an amazing laptop, was very stable, powerful in multitasking and visually nice. I was warned not to buy HP because of its overpriced, made-to-fail products, I've rejected to believe so, and now from my experience, I will never ever buy any product from HP. And to make things worse, a crappy customer service. Really, don't buy it.

In less than a year the battery died, the left mouse pad button was loose, the key board in the upper right corner became unattached, and the laptop made this weird buzzing sound. Luckily the warranty wasn't up yet so I received free repair. However, it wasn't long after the repairs that it started giving problems again (the same problems minus the keyboard detachment). I've had this laptop for 3 years. The left mouse pad mutton eventually fell out and now the mother board has crashed (not before costing me hundreds of dollars for repairing it the second time). Two of my friends have the same laptop and they both had the same problems as I did (they have also had their laptops for roughly the same amount of time that I have). One of them is still using hers but I doubt that will last for much longer. I definitely would not recommend this laptop to anyone.", "Date": "February 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "AAAAAMAAAAZING!!", "Author": "Ksieradzki", "ReviewID": "R1NBR20WN81C0D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Last summer, i was saving up enough money to buy a macbook or macbook pro. The reason? I needed a computer to use for school. When i saw this laptop, and compared it to a mac... it had more then double the memory and less then a third of the price.

I didn't like how the glossy plastic made for constant cleaning, but I could live with that. The screen was smaller than what I would have liked, but it was fast and had enough memory for my needs. However, after about 18 months, the laptop stopped booting. It only did this for about a day and I thought that the problem had worked itself out. In April of this year, The laptop completely died, and the laptop wouldn't charge anymore. I had the charger and battery looked at, and they were fine. I was told that the motherboard was completely shot. HP's customer service offered to replace the motherboard for $330. When I asked about getting a extended warranty after the repair, they told me that I could only get telephone support for it because it is too old. It's only two years old! The customer service reps are only about getting you to buy this or that item or service that won't help you with anything. I was expecting to get at least 3-4 good years out of this, but what I got instead was a nice paperweight. I will NEVER use HP again, and I would NOT recommend it to anyone!", "Date": "July 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "worked well for a year and a half", "Author": "ks", "ReviewID": "RT9YSEOR8C3PD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "laptop jus died on me.. apparantly someting is wrong with the cpu... :(.. i am thinking about purchasing a new one already....  think it wil cost to much to repair", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "17 Months and bit the dust!", "Author": "KatieLiz", "ReviewID": "RC67DXFK2AHFR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Really liked this laptop for size and outside design.  Very user friendly.  HOWEVER, the wifi assistant would stop and literally disappear from my desktop.  I would be working along then suddenly I would be disconnected from the net and the laptop would ask me to plug in the ethernet cable.  I understand this was a problem with many of these machines.  I would have to go into the BIOS to fix it, only to have it happen again a few days later.  Finally got a blue screen and it was pronounced dead last week.  I really hoped a laptop would last a little longer than 17 months!

I could even live with he annoyingly loud fan. But within 3 months my laptop would simply shut down or go into sleep mode, and couldn't be restarted for several minutes or longer. The instant sleep is unpredictable and incredibly disruptive because it occurs without warning and always in the midst of a simple task such as writing in Word or updating a PPT deck.Google HP laptop overheat and you'll find this is a pretty pervasive problem across HPs dv line. Worse, HP seems to blame Microsoft and offers a quick fix of adjusting OS settings which does nothing. Independent posters on support forums seem to blame the hardware. Given the fan noise and the way the machine shuts down without warning from the OS my money is with the hardware. Am thinking HP engineers built in an anti-overheating cutoff that forces a sleep if the laptop gets anywhere near a hot temp. Shame, since the laptop never feels all that hot when it goes down. I also use a cooling pad which helped for a while but now no longer makes any difference.", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Still going strong...blame failure on the user", "Author": "Emilio G.", "ReviewID": "R1BZT8K0X5V733", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought one of these, roughly 3 years ago, and its still in beast mode. I had a minor issue with it once that it tried to give me the blue screen of death (about 3 months ago). So, rather than crying about it, I opened it up and took the CPU (processor) and GPU (graphics [processor]) out. Much to my expectancy, there was no thermal glue left on it. So I went to Radio Shack and bought a little Arctic Silver 5...drip-drip-drop and the champ is back in the ring for another fight.My point here is most people treat computers like they run on MAGIC (@_@'). USE YOUR HEAD PEOPLE!! Its a machine, and it needs maintenance!! You don't buy a car and drive it until it blows up then go buy another one, right? So why would you do that to a computer?!(ENLIGHTENMENT)I know for a fact that not everyone knows about computers, but the truth of the matter is nobody thinks about computers as machines. Instead they buy some piece of equipment that works just fine then cry when it \"just breaks for some reason\", yet they never bothered to ask \"How/When should I do maintenance on this thing?\". Before you go ballistic on me for this just take a minute to think about it. When was the last time you took your car to the shop for an oil change? I guarantee it wasn't one or two years ago, right? It's roughly every 3000 miles isn't it? Your not an IT specialist, but your also not a mechanic, yet you still managed to maintain your vehicle....IMAGINE THAT!This Computer, by today's average user's standards, is still more than capable of anything your planning to do with it. Which is generally browse the internet, watch videos, etc.. It's compact and light enough to carry with you and has some great features to it; touch sensor bar for sound and WiFi, single-button for disabling the track-pad (mouse-pad), 3 USB ports (one of which is also an eSATA), Multi-card reader, HDMI and DVI outputs, DVD burner AND it even has a remote control hidden in the side for Windows Media Player when its hooked up to your HD-Tv...AWESOME, HELLO!...did I mention it also has Bluetooth, dual independent headphone jacks and IDT HD-Surround Sound? yeah, that's right.This laptop is a hidden gem for sure!

While the hardware seems to be more powerful, all of the possible advantages of that are destroyed by the black hole that is windows 7. The touch pad is separated from the buttons and is awkward, but that's not nearly as irritating as a touch based switch for internet. That means there's no manual override and viruses can remotely activate the internet as soon as my computer turns on - that makes me feel extra safe.The mute button can with the wave of the hand, activate and not deactivate until you shut down and start over. This is an issue related to powering down and accidentally pushing buttons you aught not.There's also an irritating nightlight that NEVER EVER shuts off unless the computer is turned off completely. This of course makes me feel extra GREEN and must definitely save energy in some other dimension where Earth and Reality don't coexist. As usual the sound plugs are in the front, rather than the side, making it more like a desktop, rather than a computer that sits on your lap.
