{"Reviews": [{"Title": "You can get a MUCH BETTER custom-build from Dell for the price charged for this SLOW laptop.", "Author": "Matt", "ReviewID": "R18BC022QZ24S1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Just began working with this brand new Dell Inspiron 17 laptop and it's extremely SLOW!!!  The only thing I've added to this system is a new version of Outlook 2010 - no pst files loaded yet and I haven't transferred any other files to it yet.Takes approximately 3 minutes to startup after a proper close-out and restart. Takes several seconds just to open Internet Explorer. Very,Very disappointed. I checked the Dell site tonight and could have bought a much better system for the same price straight from them. Amazon's return policy prohibits any returns shy of receiving a unit that does not work at all. I'd recommend anyone spend their money elsewhere for computer purchases.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Only one left--better hurry!", "Author": "denise m", "ReviewID": "R3GXV4SHBJQVHQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a beautiful box. It is sleek, lightweight, has a fabulously clear display, and runs like a charm. I am about to give this laptop a heck of a workout with all kinds of software, and I have no doubt that with its huge HD and ample RAM, it will get all my jobs done. It comes shipped with a trial of Office 2010, but if you try to run it Microsoft will direct you to its Office 365, which is a rental scheme that you must renew every year. Suggest you search the Web for a code key for 2010 that will activate the existing install. DO NOT use the \"free\" keys. You will never be able to get upgrades, etc., if they even work.I really needed the backlit keyboard for working in my low-light environment, and this laptop has that! You need to press the FN key and F6 simultaneously to turn it on. Documentation is very limited, so go online to Dell.com and download the manual if you think you'll need it.I highly recommend this laptop, most especially because it's Windows 7, and not the dreaded Windows 8. No learning curve, no figuring out, everything right where I expect it to be. Yay! Better hurry, though--only one left!", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00DQ2DXF8"}}
