Just got it today...Only thing I have a problem with is it's annoying bumpy touchpad. I mean it's smooth, but why does HP feel the need to add texture to their touchpads?Anyways, anything else is the funnest and coolest features I've ever seen. And it's speakers are just wow o_O. My last laptop, had to be on volume 100 just to barely hear it, and it wasn't even a year old. This laptop needs to just be on volume 20 and it's comfortable listening to. Also, It has ALLOT of space. so unless you hoard applications, you will NEVER run out of room. Ever. Haven't tried out the CD/DVD ROM (Optical Drive) quite yet, so I can't exactly comment on that. But you are really getting your money's worth.", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Never have been a fan of laptops until I tried this one", "Author": "K.

You must add most software after purchase, including security and Word. It runs Windows 8.1, which I find cumbersome. It comes preloaded with some apps, most of which I don't use. Frankly, many Windows 8.1 apps, such as Skype and my backup program, are not very good, and I have chosen to download the desktop versions instead. If I had the choice, I would get Windows 7. Unfortunately, it doesn't run the touch screen, which is awesome and which I need for my work. One more thing about this computer is that it is very heavy relative to most others on the market. Nonetheless, in the overall it is ok for the price. I recommend a Square Trade maintenance and accidental damage policy. Who would have guessed that Amazon sells those too? (No. I don't work for Amazon. I just want to make sure that everyone knows about this excellent coverage at about one-third the price of policies from retail stores.)", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "xmas present", "Author": "Mark A Nelson", "ReviewID": "R4RDJCEM2JIQD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Xmas present for my 16 year old daughter.

Touchscreen is incredibly responsiveHOWEVER2 things to note upon arrival to my door.1. The top left of the screen was slightly popped off the case, granted i simply \"snapped\" it back in, but you shouldn't have to!2. The battery is....loose....it's not like it doesn't hold it's connection but if ya touch it, it's almost like wigglin a loose tooth, it's still connected but it feels funny :DRegardless good computer for the price! I'd recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love this computer and the Windows 8.1 Operating System and Touchscreen", "Author": "Barry S. Coleman \"Barry S.

I have a iPad and just thought that touch screens belong on tablets and laptops were something totally separate.  I have had it a couple of days not and am comfortable with it.  I appreciate the touch screen for certain functions so my opinion has changed.  The computer is super fast and the functionality is superb.  The screen has excellent clarity and the computer has a large 750GB hard drive.  I am extremely pleased so far.", "Date": "March 7, 2014"}, {"Title": ":)", "Author": "Eugene Calabrese", "ReviewID": "R32DK12S05ZGN5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Absolutely 100% satisfied with this laptop!! it is very fast and easy to use. I was new to windows 8 and the 8.1 update but it gets easier, just as everything does with practice. I think, for the money I made a great investment in a home computer and have had ZERO issues with programs, apps, and computer function!! cant say that for all my computer interactions in the past.. again, VERY satisfied !!!

However, I can't even play farmville 2 without having the game be glitchy. I was just trying to watch a show online (not HD streaming or anything) and even though the show is loaded fully, it's like glitching through the show. And it's not the site or the show that is glitching- it's got to be the computer because I have been using the same website to watch the same show on my previous laptop for about two weeks now and it is pretty much seamless and no glitching at all.* Update: I tried another site to watch the show and I didn't have as much glitching, very minor and very infrequent, I would say. So maybe it was the previous site I was using to watch it (although, like I said, I have never had problems with it before and had fine internet connection) but I am going to give it the benefit of the doubt/ leave that up to you to decide!The glitching with watching the show has shocked me the most. It's just a simple task and I thought a 2.0 GHz quad core processor would be able to handle that seamlessly. I've even had a little delay when navigating around the computer's settings. I am now looking to find a different laptop to find something with just a little more speed, sadly. Otherwise I really, really like this laptop.Might be good for people who just like to browse the internet most of the time!*more things I have noticed is the battery power \"remaining time\" is inconsistent (which could be just my computer, or just another glitch). When it was at 18% it said an 1 hour and 8 minutes remaining. Then it hit 16% and said 38 minutes remaining. And now it's at 14% and says there are 52 minutes remaining. Not a big deal for me really, but a little annoying and I hope that that is just my laptop and not with everyones.Also I have had some sort of update to install every day since I got the laptop. Not sure if that again is just my laptop or if it has to do with being on Windows 8 (actually 8.1 since I chose to upgrade).Last thing I want to add is that I play Lord of the Rings Online, and though I don't know how demanding the game is compared to other PC games, I do want to say that it took a while to start up the game- but once it started I did not have that bad glitches. It was seamless for the most part except for a couple of times where my character wouldn't move for about...10-40 seconds (depends on if I kept clicking while it was glitching. If I left it alone it gets back up to speed faster.)Ask questions in a comment if you have any and I will try and answer because that makes it easier to make up your mind about buying!", "Date": "February 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "My 1st HP...", "Author": "eMMe \"I'm me and you're you\"", "ReviewID": "R6V1UFKYNCR41", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Always had/purchased  toshiba and I wanted a change.
