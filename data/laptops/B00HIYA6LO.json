I paid a little more than the current sale price but happy none the less. Love the style, quick boot up and keyboard, although the black case is a magnet for fingerprints. Have not used many of the Lenovo Apps, will update later on using those. No problems so far burning DVDs and playback has been stellar. Added Microsoft Office 2013 for documents, but have also used Lenovo PDF reader with no problems. Wi-Fi performance has been just OK, have used it in only a few locations so far. Speed and performance have been great, Windows 8.1 is Ok, could be a little less cluttered but hasn't detracted from laptop performance. May update a few months from now, but very satisfied!", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love", "Author": "Laticia Tharrington", "ReviewID": "R2F85LGLTFZGQM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Love the computer but hate the OS.

I haven't had any issues as of yet, but I've only had it for less than a month.  It's larger than I expected, which is fine with me because it's still light weight.  The sound and picture quality is good.  Its basically average use for me at home checking email, social networking, music, videos, and work when needed.", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome Laptop", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R2B910QYHD41TC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought one for our company and since then have bought two more ,  never had a issue and very robust item.  The screen is crisp and clear and the keyboard is very comfortable and big.  Not really a travel laptop but more of a desktop replacement.
