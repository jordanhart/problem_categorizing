In the photo, the lid looks like brushed aluminum, but in person it's smooth, shiny plastic with a brushed look. I love the chiclet keyboard -- it types with a slightly clicky, satisfying motion, very quiet with a bit more grippy finger-feel than a Mac keyboard. The touchpad is just slightly rough and the buttons feel sturdy. It's heavier and chunkier than a typical Toshiba or HP model of this class (typical of Dell), but still portable enough that I feel perfectly comfortable walking around with it.The sound quality is fairly good, although I'm not sure why Dell put the speakers on the bottom. They're right in the front where the base slopes up, so they're somewhat pointed toward me, but the sound is a little muffled when I put it on my lap instead of on a hard, flat surface. It's somewhat easy to accidentally press the button that pops open the CD tray while carrying it. The screen is shiny and bright, and the webcam image is reasonably clear, even in dim light. The microphone sound quality is clean -- I don't hear any hiss or buzz -- and it picks up just fine from a couple of feet away.Predictably comes with useless pre-installed Dell utilities that you'll probably want to remove. I don't really feel the need to comment on its performance -- the specs on this one are fairly common, so you should be able to do your own research on the hardware.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Grue", "Author": "Steve Richards", "ReviewID": "R16QWSADQ4KNO8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I normaly don't do reviews but for this item i must. I read all the reviews for the Dell and on the advise of the computor Geek that services the computers at work boughr one. I have none of the issues mentioned in the bad reviews, it runs cool, so quiet you foget its on, fast, and with several items up at the same time the ram is only running 35% and the unit still runs lightnig fast. I use my laptop as if it was a tower, I use a wireless mouse & key pad and a 23\" monitor, the laptop sits closed in the corner of my desk, if I could find a way to start it without opening the lid I would probably never open it. If your looking for a compact power house and don't need a large screen or the 10 key option, this would be a good choice. I would recomend this to a friend.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "New laptop is fast and stable", "Author": "Hank", "ReviewID": "RLLETYZVR4PZI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Laptop is replacement for 2006 XP.  So far, it is great.  Boots fast, is stable, and maintains wireless connection.  I do not like the add-on software that came with it, though (antivirus, cloud backups, etc. with) which persistently pop up and are \"in your face\" more now than ever urging you to sign up or buy.  I paid for the laptop and that's all I want and I will shop for whatever I want when I want to. I don't appreciate Dell being sneeky about the hype.  I got a good price through an Amazon vendor and fast, predictable delivery when promised.

That alone caused me to return it without even plugging it in and turning it on.  I always like to replace the slow 5400-rpm hard drives with faster ones even if it does cost me a bit in battery life.  That way if the faster drive I select does go south I still have the original one that I can clone again.  When manufactures make replacing hard drives and ram really difficult for me I simply vote with my pocketbook.  I just purchased a Toshiba P745-S4320 at another brick and mortar for almost $100 more. It has 1 less usb port, no e-SATA or bluetooth, but does have a blue ray player and most importantly the ram and hard drive are accessible.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005KP77EM"}}
