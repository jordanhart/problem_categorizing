And although I have been a PC guy all my life, I had been seriously considering switching to Macbook Air, because of it's form factor. I even bought the HP slate 500, which is a great tablet PC, but is highly underpowered and at least at this time cannot replace a laptop. Finally, I looked at the Intel Ultrabooks and liked the ASUS Zenbook a lot. So off I went to Bestbuy to buy one. But when I actually handled these machines at Bestbuy, I noted that though the ASUS Zenbooks are really pretty and sexy, the sharp edges of their metallic body is a concern - can almost cut through skin! While at Bestbuy, I also saw the 15\" Samsung series 9, and was really impressed. I therefore did some research online and found that Samsung series 9 also came in much lighter 13.3\" (2.55 pound) models. It's quite surprising that only limited information is available on the latest versions (i7-3517U) of this model - the 13.3\" model is not even featured on the Intel Ultrabook website! So, when I looked at the specs - it was a simple decision. I bought the best available model - NP900X3C-A04US (3rd gen Intel Core i7-3517U 1.90 GHz, 256GB solid state HDD) and got it a few days later. It's beautiful, solid, extremely well designed and light. I love the speed, quick boot up time and the back lit keyboard. The sound is also surprisingly good. I have not tested it's battery life yet, but it has given me a several hours worth of light office use without any issues. I would definitely recommend this machine to others.", "Date": "September 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing Ultrabook", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R32IZI87Y1NNKD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a software developer and needed a second notebook as a backup and to use at client's sites.  An ultrabook seemed to be the answer.  I researched all reviews for several months, finally zeroing in on an ASUS ux31a Zenbook.  I was concerned about mixed reviews concerning the reliability of the product. I started looking at others and heard a recommendation for the Samsung Series 9 ultrabook. After much research I ordered the i7 with 256 SSD drive. It was best decision I could have made.  First, I was impressed that the product is packaged like an Apple product. I opended it up and did what most techies do, started removing bloatware and adding my development files. I now have it for several days and have made the following observations:1- It boots very fast and the drive seems to be very quick.2- The setup was easy and the documentation is clear to use.3- The unit is not only very light, it looks and feels very sturdy for such a small form.4- The screen is amazing...the colors are clear and I have not seen any pixel problems.5- The touchpad is OK once you get used to it.6- The keyboard works for me even though it is small. I am a two finger typist and I had no problem coding with it.7- The battery life seems to be excellent. It seems to be between 6-7 hours. I have not used it for videos but I would assume it would drain the battery faster.Overall I am extremely impressed with the Samsung Series 9 i7 Ultrabook.  Amazon delievered the product in 2 days. I definitely recommend this fine product.", "Date": "October 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very fast and well-built!", "Author": "ScottS", "ReviewID": "R2TDN6UQFTQ8FH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Following up on William's comments: I too have had this model for about 6 weeks now, and really like it! It is very very fast - boot-up especially. I also like to run the Windows XP mode as one of my older development environments requires it. It's nice to be able to do this on one screen while the normal Windows 7 runs on the other (extended desktop). The built-in laptop screen is bright and crystal clear.The only slight down side is the track-pad, whose operation leaves something to be desired. In fact I found that it was unusable until I unplugged the power supply for the laptop - go figure! Working with tech support and updating the driver software did not help. Anyway, I use an external mouse anyway, but I thought I would mention this problem in an otherwise excellent laptop.", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Really good", "Author": "Manuel Gonzalez Flor", "ReviewID": "R1KPHARLIV41VL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great notebook, super light and fast.

I bought this to use my favorite operating system, Linux. Fortunately Linux loaded properly on the series 9 900x3c, unlike some other samsung laptops.Negatives: the touchpad is hypersensitive and quirky. I bought a mini-mouse to get around this issue. Not a deal breaker.Wish the charging connection was magnetic like my macbook, for safety considerations - if someone tripped over the power cord, this lightweight laptop would be launched into orbit! Has MS 7 instead of MS 8 operating system (not that I use MS products anyway).Keys are slippery, you have to get accustomed to them.Got a $250 discount! This overrides all the minor negatives by an overwhelming margin.Great, especially for the price.", "Date": "March 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ultrabook which is really fast", "Author": "Peeter Rumessen", "ReviewID": "R24DONNT2843HD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything is as described in technical specs, only you can not expect really 9 hours of battery life when you are streaming video from Internet - 4 hours max.

One feature that is especially good is the Non-glare screen; it eliminates the overhead light reflection.

I thought the Microsoft Surface Pro would be great until I did a side by side comparison with my old Lenovo.  Microsoft missed the boat as a laptop or tablet.  The things I decided I would not compromise on were:Backward compatibility with software designed to run on earlier windows (turbotax 1995-2011, Roxio Media creator, etc.).  Why pay another $1000 for touch optimized software upgrades that I don't need?Clamshell design that is at home in my lap.  No chintzy kickstand crutches or paper thin touch keyboards,  no paying $150 for a keyboard that should have been included.At least an 11 inch display.At least 6 hours of run time on battery power.under 3 lbs weight.Modern desk top software that is easy to use. No Windows 8!The Samsung series 9 was what I needed at a price much lower than the Microsoft Surface Pro 2/keyboard and the application software upgrades I would need to buy to use it. Windows 7 Pro with XP mode lets me keep my old unsupported software without having a second XP machine.I have had my Samsung for a week.  It worked well from the get go. Windows 7 took a few minutes to get used to. Stable as a rock.  XP mode works with all my old stuff and runs faster than it did on the Lenovo.  i even run my Office XP. Works with Canon LIDE-80 scanner.  Works with previous years Turbotax, Family Tree Maker, and The Master Genealogist.WIFI connects well with 4 bars everywhere I've used it.Track pad responsive.  I like it.This is a very handsome machine that is made for someone who needs a serious work machine that you can pick up and go with.On the downside:Both USB jacks should be USB-3.  Have to switch things around when using scanner and printer.Power plug looks flimsy.  Gets in the way of the USB jack next to it.Power on/off switch is too small and narrow.  Have to use finger nail to depress it.Samsung is discontinuing it for a touch screen version running Windows 8.1.  A mistake in my opinion.  The NP900X3C-A04US fills the bill much better for doing serious work or serious play.The best machine out there for doing real work.", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great fast ultrabook", "Author": "reluctantuser", "ReviewID": "R4SOO6W2V2TQ7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice slim ultrabook, no problems.
