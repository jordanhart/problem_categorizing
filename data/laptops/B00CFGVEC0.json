I have never felt this kind of experience while I was buying Dell studio and Lenovo Ideapad u510.  This laptop is really good looking, stylish and value for money.Excellent sound quality with high volume due to the extra speakers come along. Touchscreen is also very responsive. Battery life is not bad, stands for nearly four hours.Simply don't get confused in choosing your laptop, if you want a one with good looking, value for money. You can get a laptop with same performance for lower price but you will definitely miss the high resolution that comes along with and also the smart touch.All together I would say this is up to my expectations.", "Date": "July 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hubbys Christmas Gift", "Author": "Joyce Heugatter", "ReviewID": "RPPBSOT35PJT5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  I gave it to him early because his other laptop had just quit working after only about 9 months of use.  He's not too computer literate, he likes to just do email, read news, stream small videos, and play card games.I set it up for him.  It was an easy setup even with the new Win 8.  I upgraded it to WIN 8.1 just as easy.  It's a fantastic PC.  Very fast and user friendly, screen clarity and colors are BEAUTIFUL!  I wish I had bought it for myself as its capabilities are many.", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Physically Fell Apart.", "Author": "Austin Somlo", "ReviewID": "RED154E19I8I7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Originally, I was planning to buy an Alienware laptop, but I had an unpleasant experience speaking with a Dell representative. So, I looked and therefore took my money elsewhere by searching through Amazon's catalog of laptops. Therefore, I am really satisfied with Sony VAIO Fit Series SVF15213CXW 15.5-Inch Core i3 Laptop since buying it on July 18, 2013 because I was ripped off by Best Buy into buying their ultra cheap (read that: incredibly slow) laptops (I'll never do it ever again; if I want quality, I will have to be prepared to pay more for it). The speed on the processor for the Sony laptop is excellent, enabling me to multitask without a drag. I've had many programs, especially in math, running at the same time, and it has been a smooth ride. Occasionally, I've had hang-ups, leaving me to force shutdown the laptop. The laptop has recovered after each malfunction. Although Sony VAIO Fit Series SVF15213CXW 15.5-Inch Core i3 Laptop is advertised to have a touchscreen, the one I got doesn't have it. I thought it would be a nice bonus, but I can live without it anyway. If there is one thing I hate the most about the laptop, it is the mousepad. Damn, it's just annoying at times because it's all one part per se. I think it would be easier to have three separate parts. If I will buy a laptop again, I may have to avoid buying Sony laptops unless I see a three-part mousepad. I had wanted to get a laptop with Windows 7, but I was forced to swallow Windows 8 because Sony VAIO Fit Series SVF15213CXW 15.5-Inch Core i3 Laptop didn't have one with Windows 7. Windows 8 is also an unpleasant experience. I like the battery life, not that short at all. I probably can charge the laptop for 1 hour, and be without it for 2 to 3 hours depending on how much power I am using up. The design of the laptop, especially the lights on the keyboard, is pretty neat, and I can do the typing in the dark, another positive. The keyboard is simple and easy to reach over. The laptop is very light, and I can hardly feel the weight when I am carrying it around. All in all, I am 95% pleased with Sony VAIO Fit Series SVF15213CXW 15.5-Inch Core i3 Laptop because of its speed and efficiency.***NOTE*** After 10 months of use, it simply fell apart. The hinges are broken, and the screen is bent over. The screws have come unloose. I never dropped it or anything like that. The plastic is cracking up. This is very disappointing.***NOTE*** I called Sony Support to see if they can fix it for free since I was still under warranty for a year. The guy told me that to replace the missing screw, it would cost me 27 dollars. WHAT??? 27 BUCKS FOR A LOUSY SCREW? No Sony for me anymore.", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Too many issues for a brand new laptop over $600", "Author": "bigtex42", "ReviewID": "R3CCDR2QXUA2LM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This thing was rife with issues from the moment I opened the box.  The first and most glaring defect was the battery would not charge past 79% no matter how long it was left on the charger.  It also is poorly ventilated and heats up really quick.  Another huge issue is its had errors and had to \"update windows\" THREE times now in less than a week.  These mandatory reboots have taken 20 MINUTES! Last but not least it runs on the AWFUL windows 8 (i understand this is standard now and not sony's fault, but for those used to an older OS, this thing is garbage)  I have it sitting in my kitchen and I write this review from an over 5 year old macbook by choice.  Hopefully I just got a lemon but I'll be working on returning this thing ASAP.  Only reason it got a 2 is because it does perform basic functions such as internet.", "Date": "August 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Customers service is a crap", "Author": "hazem", "ReviewID": "R23ILY5EZMWERX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Customers service is a crapI bought this laptop few months ago,and i think it was the worst decision that i had made in my life,the screen get cracked spontaneously, and Sony refused to repair it.they have the worst customer service.i am not gonna buy any Sony product again.", "Date": "May 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not impressed", "Author": "Heather cannon", "ReviewID": "R3I4AMEAHZYAU7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am indifferent on whether I am pleased with this product or against it. The way this product was described gave me every reason to expect more out of it. I knew the laptop was used, however, I feel that for the price the previous owner could have made sure the product was cleaned up better. I also spent a lot of time uninstalling programs that should have already been done for me. I expected a clear and clean laptop.I love the backlit keyboard and the weight of the laptop, as well as the fact that this product does not over heat like my previous laptop did.However I do find that even though pop-ups are blocked I seem to have a problem getting rid of them. Also after about 2 hours of use the laptop restarts without warning.On another subject; I was not impressed with the way Amazon handled my purchase. First my account was frozen. (My shipping and billing address was different) so after talking to a representative I was advised to cancel my order and have my boyfriend reorder on his account (which we did). I paid extra for over night shipping, however I was waiting and waiting for my product. After my product did not arrive the next day we called once again only to be told his account was on hold. After speaking to a manager we were told that our order would be personally watched by the manager. Next day came...still no laptop. Needless to say I was about to lose my patience. I was under the impression that I was still going to receive the same product I had initially ordered. This was not the case. I received the same type of laptop however I was getting a used one instead of a new one. At that point, I had been waiting over a week for a product I needed a week prior so I went ahead with the transaction under the impression I would recieve the same quality product.This experience was chaotic and stressful. && one of the reason I am giving a 2 star rating.", "Date": "May 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "TOO SLOW......", "Author": "Yriam R", "ReviewID": "R1UQL655TPK5GV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I HAVE TO ,  KEEP IT BECAUSE I LOST THE RETURN TAG PAPER, LIKE THE COLOR AND THE SIZE,  BUT IT'S TOO SLOW,", "Date": "April 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Beauty Lap for my wife", "Author": "Mario Ramirez", "ReviewID": "R353O8UJOG51TT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price this laptop is very awasome and functional.this is touchscreen laptop with an excellent preformance and great features to use.Thank you guys, excellent deal.Regards.", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "sony vaio fit series 15.5", "Author": "Tabitha", "ReviewID": "R28LMQ8TRSPVP0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i received this laptop today.since i have not really got to use it very much my review will not be very detailed.so far i like the laptop its pink big screen very cute not too heavy.the keyboard is nice easy to type..the thing i hate about this laptop though is that the mouse pad sometimes not work which sucks. the good thing about that though is that if it stops working it is touch screen so i can just do what i need to do...overall i love the laptop", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Better than my old Vaio!", "Author": "Jarrel Walker", "ReviewID": "R13F6AVPJUG8YQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this to use for my online  classes, and I couldn't be happier.
