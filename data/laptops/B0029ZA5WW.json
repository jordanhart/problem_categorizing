{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Impressed", "Author": "V. Limon", "ReviewID": "R25W8DNK0ITBE8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I loved the look of this machine out of the box. It's thin, with a very large screen.Pros:  Huge Screen, designer case, fast cpu(ranked in top 30 for notebooks), graphics card(ati! 1GB of gddr3 ram!), good support from hp, 2 speakers w/sub,  hd audio,hdmi out, good screen resolution(1600x900), full keyboard, 500GB Hard drive, 4GB of ram.  It can run todays computer games very well. Applications open very fast. Very good integrated mic is very sensitive and can pick up anything.Cons:  low battery life, heavy, bloatware, glossy screen and chrome touchpad.  The battery life is way to low to really consider this machine something you would use on trips or flights over 2 hours long without plug  available. I also didnt think that laptops could be heavy untill I carried this laptop around the University of Texas campus. The glossy screen  reflects everything and anything making it hard to see the screen outdoors or near a window with bright light coming through. The chrome touch pad  is not as good as a plain jane plastic touchpad in that when you drag you finger, there is a little too much resistance for my liking( a little less  friction than rubbing your finger across the bottom of a shoe, unless your fingers are free of any residue, ie oils., then its smooth).Overall this machine is a great laptop allowing me to keep my desktop off now since I purchased it. Even though my desktop is a high end gamming rig, this laptop has essentially replaced it. That being said, there are probably those of you who will not want to lug it around where ever you go. If you do, do purchase a laptop backpack as a brief case design even with one with a strap would tear into your shoulders. The battery life is annoyingly low, but is expected from a laptop with a large screen and discrete graphics card. If you want more battery life choose a laptop that has integrated graphics, but performance will be much lower. The only laptop out there that I have seen with performance and big screen, with an 8 hour battery life is a $3000 mac! Vista is no isssue here as the machine is perfectly capable of running it flawlessly. THERE HAVE BEEN NO ERRORS OR BLUESCREENS!!!!! The user who rated this machine with 1 star messed up his machine him self. He is obviosly a novice user. You only get bluescreens on computers due to user errors 99.999% of the time. I have had no issues at all with this notebook.I ordered 2 of these laptops for my wife and I. The laptops came packaged very good, with no defects, and were delivered the next day after the order was placed. Both screens had no dead pixels what so ever and were perfect. All extra ports(useb, hdmi, ect) do not get in the way of each other. The laptops came with the hp mini-media remote, ac adapters, user guides, and pollishing cloths. Setup is a breese with HP's setup program. Do note that HP Games from wild tangent is much like a video game arcade, where you purchase tokens to play the games. 500 tokens a month for 6.99 per month. All antivirus software and office software is a trial version. I recommend unistalling the trial versions of office, hp wild tangent games(the games are not free!!!), norton(horrible, bloated, antivirus software), and the sling box software(uselesss without a slingbox for your tv). Free antivirus programs are out there.I am giving it only 4 out of 5 due to the battery life. Otherwise you will not be disappointed.

My specific laptop is closely related to the one advertised on this page.Normally, I don't write a review at all, if the product really sucks - my experience might be a fluke, or if it's a book I might have misunderstood the intent.  But this laptop has been such an inconvenience, that a bad review seems like real justice.The battery is too heavy & bulky.  The laptop had to be sent back several times; the first time, they 'fixed' the motherboard, the third time they had to replace the motherboard.  It still has problems - if you try to work with only the battery (i.e., the A/C disconnected), you risk the laptop suddenly shutting down - even when the battery is fully charged.There are other problems as well, and frankly the memories of wasted hours are too painful to drudge up.I can't say great things about HP support, either.  Oh sure, they try to resolve things, they aren't impolite or anything (although sometimes the accent gets in the way, so who knows if they are polite or not).  But there's just too much back and forth, for many problems that you end up resolving with Google searches in an eighth of the time.One great benefit this laptop will give you - it will train you to backup your computer fairly frequently (I use Acronis for backing up & restoring, and it's a godsend), because you never know when you will have to send it back to the shop.It was a bad mistake, choosing an HP laptop based on the look and feel of the keyboard, especially when past experiences with Toshiba have always been positive.Try another HP series; steer clear of the dv7's.", "Date": "December 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Does it all, and well.", "Author": "A. Taylor", "ReviewID": "R26ZW2U35S91M5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this laptop since September of '09, and I couldn't be happier.  It's quick, solid, roomy, and it even looks pretty slick.  I haven't had a single problem with it since I bought it.  The screen is extra bright and crisp, it plays any game you might want to play on it pretty well.  Of course some $4000 Alienware rig will blow it away on benchmarks, but it'll play anything you want it to and make it look pretty good.My favorite feature on it, though, is the built in HDMI port.  I can plug it into my stereo receiver and get 5.1 surround sound and watch streaming vids or play games on my 52\" LCD.My last three laptops have been HP.  I had a similar laptop to this one before I made this purchase, so I have a pretty good idea of what they've improved upon.  First, it seems quite a bit lighter.  If you carry it around a lot, you'll appreciate this.  Second, it runs much cooler than the previous gen.  My last one, although being called a LAPtop, was too hot to keep on your lap for any extended period of time, had heat issues, and required an external cooler.  Ergonomically, they've moved a few things around, making it easier to use (I'm specifically referring to moving the optical drive toward the front of the machine).  They removed the latch on the front that snapped shut when it was closed, because it was totally unnecessary.  Little things like that.Some drawbacks:  I wish the keys were backlit.  I REALLY REALLY do.  It's hard to see what you're typing if you're in a dark room.  Also, I don't like the scroll bar on the touch pad.  Half the time it doesn't work.  I just use a regular mouse.Overall, this is a very good laptop, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for something in this price range.  You really get a lot of bang for your buck.", "Date": "April 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "great laptop", "Author": "R.

Second the left hinge broke and there was a recall to the cooling system which fried everything but hp was wonderful and even though i got the laptop from ebay i was still able to get it fixed no cost and took about 2 weeks less than they estimated and the bonus i did not lose any info on my laptop (not important since all was backupped but still great nonetheless.  anyways decided to upgrade since the left hinge was not fixed (known problem for this particular laptop.  and they fixed all of the above with this laptop.  plug is secure and does not wiggle like first laptop, second the hinge is totally different and puts less pressure on the backing which will not cause it to break like second laptop.  Excellent computers would highly recommend.  I use mine for school work, and had taken coun 503 which required SPSS programming and it worked flawlessly and when i'm not studying for my masters I like to play games on this.  reason I got second laptop was because the original owner couldn't get wireless to work and could not play WoW on it.  wireless was fixed during recall and i'm not into WoW so not an issue.  Great computer and if your a student you can actually get a discount if your school participates which most do.  great buy and would buy another hp when this becomes obsolete.  My hp desktop works great and it's older!  so not sure why the 1 stars on this laptop.  Yeah i'm sure there are defective ones, but if you talk to hp (can be annoying talkin to someone who doesn't speak english well and when you tell them \"can't power laptop on due to power not getting to my board\" and they respond well ma'am we need to knkow what is wrong so you will need to turn it on now is a bit frustrating but after calmly telling the lady it isn't gonna happen for the hundredth time she then said well you will need to send it in and have us look at it to see if it's covered under the recall (hello, your site said my model was, it also gave a description on why it's not working and it fits it perfectly.) but they did correct the problem so yay and as for this laptop no overheating problems, none of the problems i had previously are popping up so far so I am definetely happy with this.  got this 10/07/09 so it's been awhile wanted to make sure i had it awhile to see if anything would happen but nothing love it!", "Date": "January 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Perfect Entertainment", "Author": "Neil Ramoutar", "ReviewID": "R1PMEFAD6OHRPA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have no regrets in purchasing this laptop, it is everything I ever wanted in a computer.

When I got it the 1st problem I had was with connecting with the wireless router from Linksys that I had to pay a $9.99 fee for tech support. It took 3 - 4 hours to get it working.

The computer then put me in safe mode that now video was able to work ??? I called HP about my problems with the blue screen and video problems he instructed me to do a full system recovery on my day old computer. The computer, after reinstall, came up and seemed to work then the HP tech told me to reboot the computer for updates. The computer then got stuck in a system loop and now safe mode couldn't work now. He then told me he needed me to call a senior tech in which I had to call back at a different number, after 1 1/2 of being on hold enough was enough.  HP tech had me on the phone for 5 hours.

Lets stat off that Hewlett Packard is nothing more then a black market.YES A CHINA MADE BLACK MARKET COMPUTERS! ALSO INTO THIS SPYWARE HARDARE AND SPYWARE SOFTWARE.Hewlett Packard /EBAY/PAYPAL must go out of buiness. This is not hate message. Evne the real fact I do hate these big corperations.The real deal of Hewlett Pachard or I like to call them parden my french to the consumers. Hewlett Phuckard. I am serius. lets start of with the DV9000, DV9200cto sereis Notebook computerstalk about bad design. using Cbina made black market parts. comes complete with spyware hardware and spyware software. Do not take it the wrong way. what I ment is my persioal ID and who I am where I live and what I do on the DV92000 series notebook will be sent on secret spyware hsardware and software is designed in to the Notebook computer. othter Dead design problems areOver heating motherboard. that will over heat and dies. Power supply. runs to darn gone hot. Word of caution. may melt down or explode with out warning. Heavy amount of blue screen of death just on opening a foulder. I hade the windows go out of control and gut stuck or blue screen of death. Due to the graphic controlers and the OPEN-GL Files.Hewlett Packard design to have no service. No warrenty. it clmes it dose however it dose not. Due to full cost of Hewlett Packard's corp level bank accounts. World wide bank accounts.I kid you not. Let the warrenty due. Hewlett packard tech support is the far worst ever or even same as Dell. never the less let the warrenty die. Make Beleaved they fixed it.Blacking out my own persional sofwrare that I paid money on. well becuasde I did not order it from HP it will not work. GTA IV PC for one example is also a spyware driven sending spy in my computers to block the software and the computer to work.Hewlett pckard sold one of the three dv9000 series notebooks that are bead desisng. one was sold to some on in California. I wanted 8 months for a replacment. Due to the Full Cost.\\HP sent me a dead designed notebook computer called DV7-1000z same the usbal dead design issues. all of there notebooks comes with the worlds worst O.S. on the market. Windows Vista.Micorosft main O.S. to kill poeples computers. well to tell the real data. HP dose not need to do this evel work for them. HP dose it for the all mighty constituion rights.Microosft dose take heavy amout of the blame for this issue. However HP started it from the start. Still the DV7-1000z also main objective is the Windows Vista and the hardsware simply makes a dead computer run dead. well cannot access the internet. Unable to install sofrware and runn it beucase I did not order the software from HP. So they blacked it. the information was gaven to me from the corp level of HP. over a arument on the phone.Hewlett Packard dose argue and fignt over the phone. Not a way to treat the tax paying consumers. when I pay for something. I want it to work. Not design to spy on my Visa card, bank ccount,Persional ID, who I work for. who I am shopping with. Not of there busiess to do so. never the less due to the due to the freedom of rights. HP can do what ever they please.and the Federal Goverment of the United States of America dose use Hp servies to spy on who ever the Federal govement wants to do.did you follow the special report from CNBC reguarding big corperation ripping off peoples ID? Hewlett packard was on this report on there Lazer Printers. printing out a code in yellow dots on the paper. it canss what the document is. then Hewlett Packard gets all the documents and sells it to big corperation. The bigest customer I think is the US Federal Govermentto help out in some of there privet objective. want to keep a eye on some one.Hewlett packard phone support realy stinks. Hewlett pckard killed my account. Buecase I did not follow there rules and regulations. Ok Fine. building black market computers. selling in on the market. ripping off consumers and the consumers do not have the right to ask quetions on the subject? Hell I paid for it. I demand the service I need. if not. Hewlett packard dose not follow instutctions from the consumers. I am one consumer. when I told them them not do build dead computers for a living. build more and more and more. One other thing.when I tell Hewlett Packard to give me back the money.. there excuse is its too old. why its too old? HP dose not do anything. Waste my time and money. to enforce the all sales are final.I had persioal taken the mater to the US Goverment Atterney General office. I filed many suck reports on many charges I am placing agisnt Hewlett Packard. so far I have to hire my own atterney. Gee wis Hewlett Packaerd paid money to the Federal Goverment in order to have black market protection from the Federl Govmerment. the mail I have everty thime I file a report ends up with hire my own atterney. never send a federal agient to shut Heewlett packard down. Never both to ask me to look my my notebook computers and see for them selfs The Federal Goverment must learn about why I am doing my reports. lazy work form Federal goverment atterneys. come on. I got email from the US goverment not to keep filing new reports on Hewlett packard. I got snail mail demanding me to do the same thing. Not to file reports. Go to my privet atterney.Hewlett packard prodcution line is bad for the envirement. using not save production in China. in the USA its not allowed to use those hazard products however in China there is no law o hazard products.I do not recomand Hewlett packard to any consumers. If you want my dead computers to prove it. if any one wants one can buy my dead computers 1,200.00 each Full cost.if you want soemthing to use in court. some one with money wants to take down Hewlett packard can easy send me a message.I will be more then happy to support any one that is willing to take down Hewlwett packard. Note I do not have the money to dotate to a product like that. however I will be more then willing to sell my dead computers to any one is willing to take on Hewlett packard.", "Date": "September 26, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0029ZA5WW"}}
