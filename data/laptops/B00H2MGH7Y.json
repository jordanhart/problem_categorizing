{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Review of Toshiba Customer Service", "Author": "Rhonda Schneider \"Global Book Service\"", "ReviewID": "R1364Y5GW59B83", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased a Toshiba Satellite S55t Laptop Computer recently.  The computer is mostly fine.  The one weakness I noticed that the battery was only holding charge for an hour or so.  I called Toshiba tech support to get a new part, since my computer is still under warranty.  Everything went wrong with this call.  I had to speak with two people, giving them the same verification info before I got a rep to talk to me.  Then did he ever talk.  Wow.  His first language wasn't English, so he didn't know how to spell the word \"request,\" which is part of my email.  I had to repeat it several times.  Then he put me on hold three separate times to ask someone else the answer to my question.  He wanted to continue with troubleshooting that included turning my computer off and on, with the same hesitancy and time-consuming nonsense.  I finally said \"Just send me the part.  I have stuff to do and can't waste any more on this.\"  He then told me he'd be sending me a link that I could use to order the part myself.  Couldn't he have offered this as an option up front? The call in total took 28 minutes.  So I went to the link and ordered the part.  Guess what?  Even though my computer is still under warranty, I have to pay $144 up front to assure return of my old battery, refundable upon return.  We all know that I'm bound for another hassle if the return doesn't get recorded.  Most people will return them even if there's no charge.  And what do these things costs to manufacture?  A buck tops?  So guess what?  They've just insured they get back a part worth a buck, and in the process created ill will toward their products because their customer service is so terrible.  On every level they created ill will.  I like this laptop but support is such a pain that I probably won't buy a Toshiba product again.Customer service is a pain the butt that stops your workflow in the best of situations.  Customer service is something that should be almost invisible to the user.  Users want contact with a human being.  They want this person to be able to use English fluently (or Spanish, or whatever language the support is in).  They want this person to be trained to independently solve all common problems.  I would think that getting replacement parts would be a very common problem.  And they want it to be fast, because the failure of a purchase to perform is something you don't (and shouldn't have to) anticipate.  So any time spent resolving this is a hassle.  Then it would be nice if they value their customers enough to send out a replacement part without saying \"I don't trust you.\"  Just my opinion.", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Power for not that much money", "Author": "toddler", "ReviewID": "R2DSTYPXPQ7J3H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great little laptop for the price.
