HD Video editing is not bad!", "Author": "CheapGeek \"Do it for Cheap, Find it for Cheap...", "ReviewID": "R4Z5YPN9UBSOV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this laptop almost a year ago.I bought it for the 3rd Generation I7 Quad core processor, the larger hard drive and 6gb ddr3 Ram.I like making videos and after installing Adobe Premiere Elements 11 and trying out some HD editing, I was impressed.What would take me 20 minutes to render now takes about 4 minutes.The Beats audio came with it and I really didn't care too much about that.Although- Beats Audio does have some extra audio editing feature and the small builtsub woofer does make the audio sound pretty good.It has some hardware features that I like.It's very easy to install A SSD drive and the SATA 3 supports up to 6mb per second.It has a small 32gb SSD installed already for the I7 Processor.RAM Upgrades are just as easy and it will support 16gb's of RAM.The display is sharp and HD videos play crisp and smooth.Battery life is decent and Hardware wise it's a really good Laptop-for the price.The Windows 8 Operating System works very well on this laptop.Even though it's not touchscreen, you can still use your mouse.It's really not an issue or that complicated.I know Operating system issues, hardware issues and Operator Error issues, so I know what's the fault behindhaving problems.I won't rate the laptop on User error and call it crap because of that.(Unlike some reviewers out there.)It's a solid performing laptop.It does HD editing well.It's been reliable.It's easy to upgrade.Windows 8, works very well.I really like this laptop.I gave it 4 stars because I think the webcam could be better.The video quality could be improved.It could really benefit from either a light built in, or a larger camera.This really hasn't been an issue until I started using it.Now, I know the webcam limitations.It's not terrible- just needs to be a little bit better.If that's not an issue for you, then it's a great laptop.", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Computer", "Author": "marcelo martini", "ReviewID": "RR00NPSH2714J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice computer, very nice color with a big screen, only the Windows 8 is a litle bet complicate, but it's fast", "Date": "March 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hewlett Parkard", "Author": "harry w", "ReviewID": "R1C6OD2VJ5OV4X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i love it!!! its amazing & fast to copy or open anything. i would recommend it to anybody who's thinking or want to buy a PC", "Date": "February 10, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B009PHVMC4"}}
