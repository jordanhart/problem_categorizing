It has a very powerful graphics card (GTX 460). The laptop is of high build quality. It is a little bulky but it is very sturdy. I prefer sturdy construction to thin and breakable.The laptop is lightning fast and handles anything you can throw at it. The only downside is the garbage software that comes with it (but it comes with every laptop). After uninstalling it though the problem goes away. It is full HD resolution (1920x1080), and even has some extra features such as a back-lit keyboard. It also comes with the standard ASUS warranty which is 1 year accidental damage, 2 years parts/labor. No other manufacturer comes with a warranty like this out of the box, but in reality it's not needed, the laptop has very strong construction and looks exactly like a stealth fighter. If you are on the fence about this one, I recommend buying it. I have worked with computers and IT for 10 years.[...]", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "SUPERB FOR GAMING!!!", "Author": "Haris", "ReviewID": "R30OJGU72WT2SC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is awesome, it is very fast and can handle practially all games out for pc rite now and more. asus has done a great job with this laptop. the 2 fans in the back grealtly help cycle the heat as well as the aluminum case helps absorb the heat and keeping the surface cool. very quite and fast. does not shut of due to overheating like some previous asus laptops.The best laptop in its category with a price to beat any other out there.Powerful, fast, sleek, quite and cool, simply amazing.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome Laptop", "Author": "Dr. Polanski", "ReviewID": "R180BVN78L8OLX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazing laptop.

The best part about this peice of trash is that the male end of the power source broke off in the female end of the laptop and melted off in the computer. that was about a year ago and i havent touched the thing since.
