Plenty of cpu power, memory and storage. Battery life is the only disappointment. The honeycomb aluminum panels are attractive, but show hand and finger prints. The backlit keyboard is another nice feature not normally found on Inspirons. This model is spec'd closer to the XPS line.", "Date": "May 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very Happy", "Author": "RB", "ReviewID": "R39Z4NAGXV22NE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this to replace my 9-year old (!) Dell which was struck by lightning. The only downside in my opinion is the 16:9 ratio of the display. I know this is generally all that is available nowadays because manufacturers assume that everybody does nothing on their computers but watch movies and play video games, but for some of us that is not true. I personally like the 4:3 ratio of my old computer better because that was better for displaying photos (which I do a lot) and required less vertical scrolling when reading documents and web pages, etc. For that reason I was tempted to give this one a 4 rating, but gave it a 5 because 16:9 is the current standard whether I like it or not, and I love this computer in every other way. One thing that was important to me was to get a non-glare (matte) display because I hate having to look through a bunch of reflections to see what is on the screen. Unfortunately those, too, are apparently not the norm, but thankfully this model has one! Dell did not have any current offerings with that type of screen (at least not in the size, price, etc. that I was looking for), so I am very thankful to have found this gem among last year's models. The display is absolutely gorgeous, very bright and clear, with vibrant color. The viewing angle is pretty good - the gamma still shifts a bit depending on what angle you are viewing from but is pretty good compared to other laptops I've seen (much better than my wife's laptop of another brand). The sound quality is good (also much better than my wife's laptop) - the built-in speakers are plenty loud with crisp highs, though lacking in bass (and located on the bottom of the machine which is a bit odd). When played through external speakers the sound is excellent. For playing music I personally didn't like any of the audio presets that are provided with the Waves MaxxAudio control, so I ignored those and chose the Graphic Equalizer with the \"Soft Rock\" preset instead - sounds very nice. This laptop does not have separate number keys at the right side of the keyboard as some do, but I personally prefer it this way because this configuration makes the keyboard and touchpad more centered (adding the separate numbered keys would throw everything off-center, which is one reason I chose this model over the 17-inch one). The keyboard and touchpad feel comfortable.This laptop does everything I ask it to and does it well.", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "I Was Sent Something I Did Not Pay For", "Author": "Judi Copeland \"mytigodess\"", "ReviewID": "RB43SGW12KYP1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I paid for a 15R SE for $799.99 from Laptop Deals and More which is an independent Amazon seller. Instead, I got an Inspiron 15R 5521 which costs $598.00.  I was ripped off and I'm not happy about that.  I sent a second note to the seller and still have heard nothing.  Now the window of return has closed 4 days ago.  I will not be doing business with Laptop Deals and More in the future.[Update] A total of 3 messages to this dealer which changed its name from ePark to Laptop Deals and More, they do not respond. Although the window has closed without the seller having any contact and Amazon being unwilling to refund this purchase, I have to conclude that Laptop Deals and More is a company I would warn anyone against.  They don't respond to messages at all.  I am still stuck with a computer which now, 5 months into it, has a failed hard drive.  Amazon won't do anything about it because the window of time closed and I did not return the item within 30 days.  I did not know it was the wrong product until I started to have problems with it.  It was packaged in the right box, but the item is not what was inside.  I started having problems with it 3 months after using it.What I did get was a 15R 5521 instead of the 15R SE which was packaged in the correct box, but the inside product was wrong.  The i5R 5521 worked fine for 3 months.  Now I have a failing hard drive 5 months into it.  The DVD drive has problems.", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love the toteabliity", "Author": "D. borlabd \"raven\"", "ReviewID": "RL3OM666CJCZ2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wanted something a little easier to carry than my 17\" Dell....this fit the bill.
