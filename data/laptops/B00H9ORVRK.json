Shea \"Freemarket\"", "ReviewID": "R1DN1QR6AQ57ZB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this machine after my ASUS laptop refused to charge. This machine is fantastic - light weight, charges fast, battery lasts for 6+ hours. I am able to run from meetings, to class, to home without any issue. The fast awake feature is a favorite - computer is up and running immediately. The screen itself is gorgeous and clear. The motion control is another favorite feature and has been really helpful in my studies.", "Date": "May 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "A MUST BUY!", "Author": "Christie", "ReviewID": "R37UQ6WC752RMD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This machine was comparable to an $1000 Asus I was thinking of getting. I wanted to save some cash and was beyond pleased with my purchase. It has a decent i7 cpu with 8 gigs of ram and a seperate Nvidia graphics card. The machine works great no matter what I am doing, from basic tasks to gaming on max settings. It does the job I expected it too.Don't be fooled by the 1 negative review. Everything has a fail rate and that 1 person managed to get a dud. It happens with everything. I can assure you that my machine works great as well as many people I know who own the same one. My recommendation if you're worried it won't work. Buy from a physical store so you can get help easier and faster in person.", "Date": "April 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "don't buy this piece of crap.", "Author": "Gini \"artisticponderer\"", "ReviewID": "R1OPU7YCU03WLT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Especially when you realize that the graphics card can't handle simple programs like quicken and you spend 2 days trying to get someone to help & the first tech really screwed it up so no one neither me or any of the hardware software \"specialists\"anyhtng because the resolution which she couldn't fix, she just made gigantic frames.  No one was able to get around them - no way, no how.  So the only solution was to \"factory reset\".  I have wasted 2 days & nights trying to fix this - so I lost all my info because what I thought I had backed up never did from this \"tablet.\"  Don't let Lenovo tell you it is a laptop.  Far from it.Plus do not under any circumstances let them talk you into Windows 8.1!  It does not work even in the go arounds such as having to do a search (which you better get used to sliding it out from the side under what ever is on your screen).to find device manager or internet explorer once their \"specialists\" have screwed up their piece of garbage.Save you money and buy an HP I got a new  one last year for my husband who knows nothing about computers for $250, I would gladly have paid twice that amount for it.  Never a problem - ever and he uses the internet all the time (that he does know how to use!).  And a few months before buying his HP I got a great one with num pad for $350 with an ancient trade-in!So I have learned a very expensive lesson.  Buy a cheap laptop(not tablet with screen attached as Lenovo does) & if it doesn't work it can go in the garbage and you will still have a life!  PS Waranty - none.  Call & they try to sell you anywhere from 1$29 to 189 for a one year \"we'll try and fix it policy!\"by the way, I have to tell you I love Amazon - own their stock, a prime member & buy whatever I can from them.  What was I thinking when I bought from Lenovo?", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00H9ORVRK"}}
