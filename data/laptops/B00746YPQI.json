This one I got has 4GB of ram and 128GB harddrive. I use this laptop mainly for browsing the internet and some programming. Now that you have a little background Ill give a quick review.From the get go this laptop is MUCH faster then my previous Macbook air. When you open the lid you are ready to go that second. On the old one I would have to wait a little for it to load and if I left chrome up and clicked on it right away then I would get the loading wheel. I havent seen this do it once. That could be because of the harddrive being so much faster.When I opened the box the laptop was already charged to 91% so im trying to kill it. Well I was on it ALL NIGHT last night and now its the morning and its only at 60%. That battery life is amazing and let me honest thats what we ask for in a laptop.If you are up in the air about this laptop(no pun intended). I would say give it a go. You could even buy it from the Apple store and if you dont like it just return it.If you are replacing an older Macbook air and have one thats because the mid 2012 then I would say get it but if you have the mid 2012 I dont know if I would suggest spending the money unless you really want battery. I hope this helps anyone trying to purchase this laptop.I am not an Apple fan boy. My desktop is a custom build Window machine so I know both worlds. Please if you have any questions just comment and I will be happy to try things for you or just answer questions.I am a Computer Engineer so im use to testing things so feel free to ask.(This is my first review)", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "MBA Will Be Perfect Once It Gets Retina Display", "Author": "Mike B", "ReviewID": "R434HN9G6BT0B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This might look like just a minor spec bump from last years model. However, the new MBA boasts all day battery life: 11 inch (9 hours) and 13 inch (12 hours). This is a big step up from the previous generation. This is due to a larger battery and more efficient processor. The upcoming OS X Mavericks is supposed to be even more energy efficient than Mountain Lion. The MBA is also faster due to the new processor and has a faster wifi connection. The solid state drive in this computer makes it much faster than a regular hard drive computer.This is a great computer overall. The screen is not as nice as the retina Macbook Pro, however it is not a deal breaker. The MBA is a lightweight, portable computer and the Retina screen is thicker, heavier, and more expensive. Once they manage to make a thin, lightweight Retina Display this computer might be perfect. You will probably not miss the disc drive on this computer because it is a featherweight without it and you can use an external disc drive if you have to or remotely access another computer with a disc drive.If you are debating between the 11 and 13 inch models, it depends on what you want to use it for. The extra screen space, SD card slot, and longer battery life for $100 more makes the 13 inch a worthy choice. However, some want a truly portable machine that can fit easily in a large purse or briefcase.If you are debating between this computer and an iPad with a bluetooth keyboard, consider the ease of use and functionality of the computer versus the portability and cost of an iPad. For students, it is nice to have a real keyboard and be able to easily create documents, spreadsheets, and powerpoints on an actual computer, but I see more and more students with iPads and a keyboard case getting by just fine.If you are debating between 128GB and 256GB (or custom order 512GB from Apple), consider cloud storage. Flickr now has 1 TB free photo storage with no size restrictions. Google Drive and Evernote are great for documents and you can always store your iTunes library on an external hard drive if you have a massive library.If you are debating between this and a Windows Ultrabook/ Google Chromebook, consider the operating system, reliability, customer service, and resale value. People love Apple products and you can resell the computer if you want to eventually upgrade. They hold their value pretty well. The operating system takes a little getting used to but it is a lot smoother than Windows and you will probably never want to switch back to the dark side. If you really need a Windows Program, you can run Windows on a Mac.", "Date": "June 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simply the awesomest one out there", "Author": "Jonathan Arnoux", "ReviewID": "R1NSENQ6BRBUR3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was shopping for a laptop for college and I was initially not considering buying a Mac by principle (anti-Apple-ism, price,...). However, I received many good arguments to buy the Macbook Air and was finally convinced because all the other laptops working under windows I was considering had problems of some sorts, as reviewed by many users. Therefore, I bought the Macbook Air with a 14-day trial. I thought I would bring it back but I never did and ever since it's been a love story.Even though you've probably already heard it all, here are overall the best things about the Macbook Air that makes it the best laptop out there (even with the new Macbook Pro):-Battery life is excellent and recovery is fast. There are several ways to make the battery last longer and some options in your settings.-It's SUPER light, which is a major plus for a college student if you need to bring it to class and around. After a few weeks working with it I was surprised how big and heavy other laptops seemed to me, you have no idea.-The design is very nice, but that's a somewhat subjective notion.-It really doesn't take long to get the hang of all the commands and you might discover some cool \"shortcuts\" by accident, like I did. The experience is just wonderful and if you need any help, there are just so many websites and blogs that can help you and have tutorials or problem solving for new-to-Mac users like me.-The operating system upgrades are free, unlike Windows'. The new OS X Mavericks is just amazing, it's slick, stylish, colourful and just so much adapted to a student's needs!-You can work on many screens, so multitasking is made easy.-If you're Windows-nostalgic, you have the possibility to install a parallel. Plus, the Office for Mac is mainly the same as the Windows one except there are maybe more templates and the designs are more aesthetically appealing. You can also install Google Chrome, Mozilla and other browsers, as you wish.-Internet-browsing is fast and you can zoom/unzoom pics just with your fingers and the trackpad.-The trackpad is life itself in the form of a technologic device: it just feels so smooth and you almost feel like you're the one moving the page like you would with a book or magazine.-The new OS X Mavericks gives you iBooks for free, and iMaps and you can add a map or directions to your events on iCalendar.-If you have an iPhone or iPad, you can sync them with your Macbook and you just have an infinity of possibilities and uses.I hope this was useful and that it helped you in your decision-making process.", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing, am shocked how it far outperforms my older Macbook Air", "Author": "VeritasluxMea \"Neoplatonic Platonist\"", "ReviewID": "R1RAKRYX5GWI32", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Working off formerly a 13\" macbook air mid 2011, I just bought this new 2013 model with the Haswell CPU and low power consumption infrastructure.Off a full charge, I disconnected 3 hours 40 mins and had an external drive connected the entire time, restarted 4 times, and did NONSTOP heavy application installs (Office suite, Photoshop etc.), a total of 23 applications, and ran youtube vids in the background the entire time, and after all of that nonstop heavy loading, I had 76% on my battery, of which id have around 35% on my older Macbook Air.Further still, the entire unit has run UTTERLY COOL during this EXTREMELY heavy loading, installing and heavy 1080P video graphics play. My other Macbook Air would be almost too hot to touch underneath near back under same conditions.Even without 802ac (new Wifi connection thru the new Air), I notice roughly 25% faster throughput on likewise file downloads using my new Macbook Air than that of my older version Macbook Air.This new Macbook Air contains PCIe-Based Flash Storage Approaches 800 MB/s Read and Write. I notice BLAZING fast write speed on my 1.1 Gig Photoshop app, and seemed about 40% faster than my previous generation Macbook Air. Also, this new Air model contains PCIe-based SSD modules made by Samsung and is smaller than the previous Air model SSD made by Toshiba.These new Airs also sport batteries with increased capacity driven by higher voltages: increasing from a 7.3 V, 6700 mAh power battery to a 7.6 V 7150 mAh power battery. Other changes include a redesigned expanded heat sink covering both the CPU and GPU, which must be why this unit runs SO COOL even maxed out.ALL my apps run perfect on this new Air, including Office suite, and the entire Adobe suite and the rest of my apps, ....which it should, its still running Mountain Lion OS.I really have to say again, that write speeds on HUGE app instals is just faster than you dare hope for; its just blazing faster than my previous gen. Air.My Macbook Air has been without a question my most treasured gem of \"go-to\" Mac product hands down, I own all of them (2 Airs, Macbook Pro, MacMini etc),...I was skeptical when I shelled out $1099 today for the new Haswell Air and its presumed prognosticated \"crazy long\" battery life and improved speeds overall; but the hype isn't hype, its real and amazing. The mere NOTION that I can overload this Air with App installs, and have a 2.5\" HD attached for nearly 4 hours, run 1080P Youtube vids,...and still be at 76% Batt life is just, well, its stunning.Tested out the NEW dual (stereo) mic and it IS much nicer in record, additionally the camera/vid is much sharper and  crisper than my other Mac Air.  Considering the price point is lower on these new Airs than the older ones,  I give the new Macbook Airs a \"110%\". Having repaired laptops (non mac) in the past, and owned at least 20X more laptops than most consumers, I don't lightly conclude this is the cornerstone workhorse for everything I dare consider doing, fast got faster, and battery life now is enough to make a crusty \"hates everything\" person like myself nearly cry with joy. Congrats Apple! Homerun on this lovely gem.I didnt get this delivered in one day, I picked it up from my local Mac store, I got my buddy to sell it to me 1 day before they officially \"have\" them which is today 6/12. As for the questions about using this new Air with Photoshop and it lagging on heavy filtering and photo editing, Ive tested that fully and this IS the machine you want for ultimate portability, it works fantastic.Also of great importance is that this version of Mac Air is supposed to have \"nearly double\" fast write speeds as the Macbook Pro Retina. And the new Hard storage on this Air has \"up to 6X faster than a 5400RPM disk drive\" as found in current Macbook Pro which contain 5400RPM Toshiba Hard drives (made by Hitachi for Toshiba actually). In short, YES, this is a perfect \"must own\" book in the field or travel use for photoshop work, with just blazing fast write speeds, and crazy long battery life.This new Macbook Air brings TRUE definition to being \"disconnected\" and \"portable\" to those who want to do a LOT of work free of the power socket!

I couldn't figure out if I wanted the Pro Retina or the Air, and I wasn't sure if I wanted 13 in. or 11 in. Now, I actually own both the Macbook Pro 13\" Retina and the new Macbook Air 11 inch, and I understand most people won't want to buy both but these are my thoughts. I first got the 13\" Retina, because I loved the screen, esp. the way text looked because I read a lot and it made such a difference. I have the i7 version, plus the 8 GB RAM, and 256 hard drive. I love that thing. It's gorgeous and fast, a pleasure to work on. BUT. The only problem with it for me is the weight. I know it's lighter than it used to be but I'm petite and when I'm traveling and need to give presentations, this thing is in my bag the entire day, and I find it heavy. Many people may well be stronger than I am but I personally find it a pain to drag around when I'm on the road. Also, the battery life is good but not brilliant, so if I use it all morning and a part of the afternoon unplugged, it's dead.So I recently bought the 11 inch Macbook Air as well, the new version, also maxed out, i7, 8 GB, etc. It is so light, it's amazing. It' lightning fast and the battery life is incredible. I can use it and use it and the battery won't budge. However. The screen is so much less good than my Retina Pro. I'm not a picky person and before I got used to the Retina screen, I didn't mind but now, it's a huge difference. The text is pixelated and very small, the whole thing looks much less good.Basically, I think that if you're going to be mainly stationary when using the laptop, I would definitely go for the Retina Pro 13 inch. At home, it's all I use nowadays. It's a joy to use and looks amazing. However, if you travel a lot and will mainly be using it on the go, I think the new Air is fantastic.  I hardly notice it in my bag and the screen is fine, just not as beautiful as the Retina, plus the performance and battery life are incredible. If the weight of the Retina doesn't bother you, that would be the clear choice.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "A battery that does what a laptop needs / Volume Fluctuation Issue", "Author": "Publicagent \"Publicagent\"", "ReviewID": "R1Q0F7VTF30P2S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been using the new Macbook Air for almost a week now. I actually started with the 11 inch because I wanted the lightest possibly laptop, and I used to have a smaller screen, but I guess it was just too small. I was noticing things like a shaking screen and I had been using a 15 inch Macbook Pro with the aluminum keyboard for the last five years. When I got the 13 inch, everything looked and felt just right.In my opinion, a laptop battery has one major task. It should allow users to do everything they want on their laptop without having to plug it back in. I used it for about 1.5 to 2 hours two evenings in a row doing internet surfing, minimal video watching, and some word processing. The next day I used it for close to 8 hours of word processing and internet surfing. You know you have an amazing battery when the bar goes red, and you check to see that you still have two and a half hours remaining. I did not check exact times, but I think I got over 11 hours before charging it back up (including 3 days of sleeping). I was also surprised to see that it had recharged before I went to bed!In this day and age, laptop users should understand that you never get the same amount of battery life watching non-stop high quality videos as you would using basic software and the internet. I use a laptop fairly frequently for projects/entertainment, but can not think of one instance in which I would need over 12 hours of battery life. More than 8 hours and my eyes start to blur. The bottom line is that Apple's initial estimate of 12 hours is not off, and I am happy to say that I will not be taking my charger with me anytime I plan to return to my house to sleep later that evening. I don't have to worry about battery life for the first time.One small quirk is that the time estimates of the battery are sometimes off. For instance, I have checked my battery status and seen an estimate of 17 plus hours remaining. I admittedly got overexcited before it quickly went back down to over 12. The percentage is always accurate, however, and it's intriguing to see how long you can last with 100% battery life remaining.As for the rest of the computer, the keyboard is great, the screen is nice, but not stellar, and there is a slight glare when I work in direct sunlight though it's nothing objectionable. I think that Apple has set a new standard with this laptop because it's obviously light, but the battery is truly amazing. It's also picking up the internet feed in my house as good if not better than my other devices.IMPORTANT UPDATE: I have noticed an issue with volume fluctuation when watching movies on Netflix and sports on ESPN. The issue persists on Safari and Firefox. Unfortunately, other are having this issue and no one that I could find as of yet reports it as being resolved. This is a shame. This laptop is so good otherwise I am still giving it 4 stars, but this is a major issue. I have downgraded to 3 stars until this gets resolved.UPDATE REVISED: The volume fluctuation issue appears to have been fixed with an update. Loving the laptop again.

We have an older 17\" Macbook Pro that has been through the war and still functions perfectly. Since day 1 this MBA has dropped wi-fi connections everywhere continuously, and despite doing everything by the book-phone support and software upgrades, genius bar appointments, higher level support,etc, and 3 swap outs for other machines it still drops wi-fi. This is a widely known issue worldwide, yet Apple still has no fix for it. They continue to sell it and then ignore you or make you jump through senseless hoops for no reason-there is no fix. Was contacted by an Apple engineer who made me run a diagnostic and send it to him. He said he would help me-never heard from him again.After my last genius bar appointment, after running a diagnostic that proved the drop, the best they could offer was for me to upgrade to a retina-pro-at my expense. I really like the machine otherwise, but Apple has really dropped the ball here and in my opinion is committing fraud. There is much speculation on the forums as to why and how, but as consumers its really not our problem to diagnose or fix.They know its broken-its a widely known issue world wide, there is no fix, yet they continue to sell it. The official Apple Macbook support forum has probably 200,000 views on the wi-fi issue posts and 1100+ replies....more than any other post. Wake up Apple!-fix this issue.

Lasts longer than MacBook Pro models especially retinal display4. Very Fast - solid state hard drive not a disc so very quick loadingCons1. Display isn't as nice as the MacBook Pros particularly the retinal display.2. Only two USB ports and thunderbolt  port. No SD port. No Ethernet port3. No Disc Drive \"Optical Drive\" but none of the new Mac lap tops (MacBook Air or MacBook Pro models) have this. Also it wouldn't be a MacBook Air if it had the disc drive(would weigh more) so it's a moot criticism. I already owned a separate disc drive than I can easy attach through a USB port and I never need to use it anyway since everyone can be downloaded online. Only time I need it is to watch DVD'sWhy Mac over PC1. No Spam - search the internet in peace without multiple pop-ups and adware slowing your computer down. No viruses2. Not Windows! - I recently experienced Windows 8 on another laptop and it is atrocious. I'm so glad I don't have to deal with Microsoft products and Windows. I can't believe they found a way to make WIndows more cumbersome3. Intuitive - Macs are designed with human intuition in mind. Everything is designed to be simple and easy to use. You don't need experience with Macs to use this. Since 2007 when Macs began to use Intel chips, the Macs took the best Windows had to offer and improved upon it. You can even buy Microsoft Office for Mac (which I have) so you lose nothing.  So if you are scared to use a Mac, you will find these new Macs are very easy to use.4. Great Service in Apple Store - if something breaks down, Apple is great about replacing parts, computers and honoring warranty.5.

The all aluminum chassis has a pleasing texture, it is lighter yet feels far more solid than any other ultrabook I have encountered. The hinges have no undue give, yet there is little effort needed to engage them.The trackpad is a marvel. After only a few days I am amazed I ever used a Windows laptop without proper OS trackpad integration. Every flick and swipe is picked up and acted upon without hesitation, it is a shame this responsiveness is so alien when coming from Windows.OSX is very polished, lightning fast on this SSD. I find myself much preferring it for every activity I use my PC for besides gaming. Swiping between fullscreen pages is intuitive, trackpad gestures are tight and do much to streamline navigation. I feel more compelled to recommend it to clients, no more ad-ware, no flavor of the week virus infections. No embarrassingly mid-life crisis 'reinventions' to fight with as in Windows 8. One OS for desktops and laptops, separate OS for touch-enabled devices.802.11AC Wifi! I can finally use my lonely 5GHz band! I have not experienced any wireless dropouts or hiccups as others have described.Haswell architecture has enabled an unheard of real-world 10-12 hour wireless browsing battery life while packing a fully featured quad core i5 chip with HD5000 graphics. Unprecedented for this size and weight. HD5000 tackles Skyrim at comfortable mid-level graphics and playable frames, at the expense of extreme system heat.Built in bootcamp allows easy Windows 7 dual booting for those OS specific applications, still eeking out 6-10 hours depending on usage, providing a better Windows experience than Microsoft themselves.CONS:Maybe HDD space? All my music is stored with Google, photos and documents on Dropbox and Skydrive. Install Office and Photoshop and still have 90GB left.This is not really a con, just a function of nature. Packing this chip in this form factor means heat! Working in OSX is fine, doesn't break a sweat. Once you bootcamp Windows 7 and try on your gaming pants however, expect this thing to live at 99 degrees celsius with fans full tilt.I used to argue against Macs purely from a price point perspective, but for $999 (bought at Best Buy) I feel this machine is a steal. I can see myself using this system for the next three years easily. With no mechanical hard drive and sturdy construction it will take quite a drop or impact to take this thing out.In closing, the Macbook Air shows that a carefully controlled eco-system can work in the right hands. As opposed to leaving manufacturers to their own devices and quality control standards, Apple has examined every facet of their platform and made purposeful design choices, polished them over several generations and realized them with very strict hardware standards.I have experienced the Windows 8 bombshell from ground zero. Poorly implemented and designed manufacturer software, random black screen freeze ups and hundreds of other software bugs, 5 different operating system recovery methods for 5 different manufacturers, it no longer makes sense to me.I have been assimilated into the cult of simple OS interface and reliable, controlled hardware platforms.", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's small, light & the battery lasts FOREVER.", "Author": "Jonathan Edwards", "ReviewID": "R2CS3FXYZFYE3I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I sat at the store debating on the 11\" MacBook Air or the 13\" MacBook Air for about an hour the day I bought this laptop.

I agree, this is a truly fine thing. Forget the \"feeds and speeds\" metrics so many people seize on (although the performance is pretty good on this for what most people do), I just feel that this thing is in total harmony with me. It is powerful yet light and agile. I have a 13\" Macbook Pro and it is great but a bit heavy. The Macbook Air is insanely light and yet very sturdy.The one thing I really stressed over was whether to get the 11.6 inch model or the 13 inch model. Years ago I had an early netbook. It was nice as a novelty but it was really underpowered. It turned out the 10 inch screen was just too small. The size of the screen on the netbook was just too much of a compromise (my eyesight isn't what it used to be!). I was concerned that the 11.6 inch Macbook Air screen might be too small also. I really wanted to get it instead of the 13 inch screen because to me, getting a larger Macbook Air just seemed to defeat the purpose of getting a small, light computer in the first place. I really wanted the 11.6 inch model to work out. The price difference really wasn't an issue, I just wanted to have the perfect size for me. I saw a few 11.6 and 13 inch models and I thought the 11.6 inch would be okay but I had the nagging feeling that when I started using it, I would regret getting the smaller version. You know how that goes, your first look at something is brief and you don't really get a feel for how you will use it in the real world. Sometimes your initial conclusions turn out wrong and you regret your choice. Well, I took a chance on the 11.6 inch version and after using it for a while, I am really happy with the choice.

Here are some of the reasons why:Most of the computers i encountered did the not have such a good battery life, or you needed to get a bigger battery (which adds weight) or a battery sheet (which adds costs). THis computer easily gets 8 hours of heavy duty use, but has gone as high as 15 for me depending on how you use it.Another reason is that comparatively , it is not that expensive. To get a similar thin, lightweight computer would be expensive even if you bough a windows based one. The mac just looks and feels like a quality computer.It is so easy to use. I thought it would take a while to get use to but after a day i was already using it it like had been for years. Right out of the box everything just seems to work.

Getting used to the smaller hard drive is a work in progress. I think that is mostly because it's nice to have all my movies, music, and pictures available on a whim, but in reality, I rarely access my movies and pictures, so they have made their way onto an external drive until I set up iTunes Match.I have had some pretty significant issues, though.Firstly, I am unable to connect my 1st gen iPad via USB cable. While I don't expect to be able to charge from the MBA, the inability to even set up wireless sync with iTunes, which requires a USB connection to set up, makes this habitual backer-upper very nervous.Secondly, connecting the 2007 Apple bluetooth keyboard and the 2009 Magic Trackpad interferes with WiFi, causing low speeds and intermittent connections.  These issues are experienced when one or both devices are connected, unless I am standing right next to the router.  Even adding a repeater does not boost the signal enough to solve the issue.  The suggestion thus far from Apple is to switch to a 5GHz router or to test all the channels on the 2.4GHz band. At this point, I am unable to practically use bluetooth devices with my brand new computer.I have been in contact with Apple Support, replaced the MBA, duplicated the issues on a fresh install (and after running software updates) and been back in touch with Apple support with the same issues.

You would also have no problem using this while in chemo treatment.--the speed.  i have never had a laptop which performs at this speed.  it makes my macbook seem like a snail. i did pay extra for the absolute top level of RAM and gigahurtz so that helps as well.  they were not expensive upgrades. multitasking is a dream on the mac air. no program displays the annoying not working sign (which means you need to close programs).  if you want a lot of programs open, this is the machine for that.--i have hearing and visual problems. the sound and viewing area on this mac air completely meets my losses.  i watched a movie on it the other night and it was perfect.i switched to macs from pcs in 2006.  i became quite adept on pcs but i got tired of fixing them.  macs by comparison almost never need repair. i've only ever had one mac crash and that was my first one in 2006 which apple fixed in a day. i, of course, had to put all my data back in which is a pain.  but it has never happened again on any apple hardware i've bought.  so reliability and durability is second to none.i did buy directly from apple online.  i did find it very easy to build the machine i wanted going through apple.  i don't see any monetary savings going through amazon instead or if there is, it must be nominal.although i have stressed the senior benefits, i have two nephews in their 20s and i think they would adore this machine as well.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Known Issues with this Model.

I use PC's too (only when I have to, lol!). My first laptop was a Macbook Lombard purchased new in 1998 for about $2,800. This new MBA is 10 times the machine for about a 1/3 of the price. FWIW, my Macbook Lombard served me well for over NINE YEARS, and is still is use by a good friend!! Try that with a Windoze machine....I currently own a 2010 Macbook Pro 13\", a 2011 Macbook Air 11\", a 2012 Macbook Air 13\", and just a few days ago I got the newest MBA 13\" with the Haswell chipset. The battery on this newest version life is astonishing! They are not exaggerating when they say 12 hours--I get that and more! Seems like twice the battery life of my 2012 MBA.Other noticeable differences between my 2012 13\" and my 2013 13\":Screen is better (brighter/crisper)Speakers are betterWifi is fasterGraphics are fasterThe only thing close to a downside is that some tests show the new Haswell processor is about 5-10% slower than the previous i5 processor, but, I don't see a performance  difference at all (I think this is largely offset by the much improved flash drives in the newest models) and even if I did, it is a price I'm more than willing to pay for the amazing boost in battery life. If you're buying an Air, more than likely it's because you're highly portable, and having a highly portable laptop with less than great battery life doesn't make much sense. These new Haswell processors solve that problem.I like my Macbook Pro 13\", and for a long time I thought the Air's were kind of an expensive novelty that didn't even include an optical drive! However, these days I place a high value on portability, and nothing comes close to the Macbook Airs. I picked up a superdrive for $75, even though I rarely use it. (I also have an iMac 24\" for burning)Lastly, for those who are agonizing about whether to get an 11\" or 13\", as someone who owns both, I can say this: get the 13\"!At the end of the day, they weigh about the same (the 13\" only weighs 6 ounces more than the 11\") and the 13\", while it's only 1\" wider and 1.4\" deeper than the 11\", the difference in usability/visibility of the screen is HUGE. I really wanted the 11\" to be enough--its small size is awesome (being about the same size and weight of an iPad but it's actually a real computer) but I finally had to admit that the 13\" just has soooo much more screen real estate for a very small increase in footprint/size/weight. Both fit easily into a laptop backpack or shoulder bag and they're so light that you hardly notice you're carrying them, but the larger screen of the 13\" easily wins out over the coolness of the 11\"'s smaller form factor IMHO.", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Laptop on the Market", "Author": "DR", "ReviewID": "RT8H5JBVQO9SI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is for the 11.6\" MBA which I just picked up last week at an Apple store. I'm a seasoned Apple user, owning a 24\" iMac, circa 2009 and a 13\" MBP (also 2009) which was bricked after I dropped a very small amount of water on the keyboard a few months ago.I always wanted to purchase a MBA and was always partial to the 11.6\" model but prior models just didn't cut it at a reasonable price point. A 64GB SSD is just not enough storage when you consider that your OS and basic productivity software are going to easily consume at least half that space. When Apple announced the new versions with 128GB standard and starting at $999, I decided the time was right. That said, I still sprung for the 256GB model simply because for an extra $200 I likely won't have to worry about storage concerns for the coming years I use this notebook and to me that's worth it. I think one could probably get along just fine with the stock 128GB if storage demands aren't high. Now that most large files are moving into the cloud, local storage space seems to be less of a concern.PerformanceOut of the box it took just a few minutes to configure the laptop and I was logged in. Right away I was blown away by the speed increase of this laptop. Keep in mind that I only have 4GB of RAM and the basic i5 Haswell processor that comes standard. Safari loads pages instantly and as much as it pains me to say, makes my iMac look rather sluggish. I was torn about whether or not to upgrade the RAM, but I decided to stick with the 4GB, reasoning that at 11.6\" it was unlikely that I would ever run software so complex to necessitate that much memory. Now I am glad I made that choice because between the improved processor and SSD, this thing runs at phenomenal speeds. Go ahead and upgrade your memory if it gives you peace of mind, but just know that it is probably completely unnecessary.DisplayOne thing that continues to bother me is the bevy of comments about the lack or Retina display on the MBA, especially the 11.6\" version. This is a small laptop, and while it might be nice to have a little crisper display, you aren't going to notice a huge difference at this size. Plus, running a Retina display consumes more battery life and increases the price. In any case, don't fret about the display on the new MBA's- I can tell you that the displays are great and you will be hard-pressed to notice a difference unless you've only used Retina displays for the past several months.BatteryOne of my biggest complaints about my old bricked MBP was the battery life and Apple's false claims of 7-hours of continuous usage. I can tell you that that was patently false. I was lucky to get four hours of use on a full charge and that was if I had the brightness way down and only running a couple of apps at a time. That said, I was extremely skeptical about Apple's claims of 9 hours of usage with the new 11.6\" model. I can say that I am again blown away by the improved battery life, which is the best I've ever gotten on any portable device. In the time I've used it, I continue to find myself glancing at the power meter and being surprised that it is still +90%. There is no doubt that the battery life has been substantially increased over previous models. I attribute this to Intel's new Haswell architecture more than anything. I am looking forward to upgrading to Mavericks which is supposed to improve the battery life even more.PortabilityWhen I bought my MBA, I had very little doubt that I would opt for the smaller, 11.6\" model. I had friends trying to convince me to spring for the 13\" model, saying that the 11.6\" model is too small. If you are debating between the two, I would just advise you to ask yourself the following- where will you use this laptop the most? If it is for work outside the home or travel, and you anticipate carrying it around a lot, there's no question- get the 11.6\" version. It is the perfect size and weight for a laptop. I am of the opinion that a laptop's purpose is portability, so I don't really think anybody should get the 13\" model. If you anticipate working mostly at home, then your best bet is to buy an iMac, which I believe is the best desktop on the market, or buy the 11.6\" model and get an external display to connect to it. For some reason people get scared by the seemingly small screen on the 11.6\" version, but as a power-user who does a lot of coding and productivity work on mine, I can tell you I love the size of this laptop and haven't regretted not getting the larger model.All-in-all this is in my opinion the best laptop on the market if you prefer OSX. If you are in the market for a new laptop you will never regret buying an Air.", "Date": "June 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good machine when it wakes up from sleep (after reboot)", "Author": "John R.

However, it has an annoying problem of going into power saving mode and not coming back if you touch it at the wrong time. I'll attach the bug report (15550585) I submitted to Apple. They closed the report since they said it was a duplicate of another bug report (15556091):Summary:On any mid-2013 MBA (11\" or 13\"), when system is idle long enough to dim the display/go to sleep, the screen fades to black. If the user tries to prevent sleep by tapping a key or trackpad, the system hangs with a black screen. The CAPS LOCK key toggles on/off when pressed, but no other user input seems to do anything. Closing the screen and reopening has no effect. Only a hard boot will bring system back. The happens whether on battery or plugged in. Any unsaved documents/code files are lost.Steps to Reproduce:1. Let system idle and wait for display to dim (based on power settings).2. Wait a couple more seconds for screen to go black.3. Wait a split second more for keyboard backlight to begin to fade.4. Before keyboard backlight is completely off, press a key or swipe the trackpad (as if trying to prevent the system from sleeping, thus requiring re-entry of password)Expected Results:I would expect the system to wake up and let me continue with what I was doing.Actual Results:When touching the input as the keyboard backlight is fading, the backlight illuminates brightly, but the screen stays black. The CAPS LOCK key will toggles its light on/off. No other action will wake up the system. Only a hard boot will bring system back on.Version:My personal machine is a mid-2013 MBA, 11\", 256GB SSD, 8GB RAM, i7 chip, currently running Mavericks, but issue first noticed out-of-box running Mountain Lion.Notes:I brought my MBA to an Apple Store on 11/2/2013 and demonstrated the behavior to a \"genius\" with my configuration running Mavericks and when booting to Apple's \"known good\" environment running Mountain Lion.

I've used PCs since the '80s and know my way around them pretty well.The instant-on features and battery life of about 10 hours makes this more like using an iPad than I ever would have thought. It's great to just pull out and get to work; no startup delay, no looking for a plug, and it's silent (I don't know if it has a fan, but I've never heard it). The SSD makes programs open nearly instantly. And it comes with Pages, Numbers and Keynote to get you up and running with productivity apps.Biggest pluses over everything else:- Best trackpad I've ever used: I never would have thought I could get used to a trackpad after almost unusable experiences on nearly every PC laptop I've used. It's huge, sensitive and nearly always makes sense after just a couple minutes of figuring out the gestures.- Long battery life: This really has all-day power. No need to find a plug or carry a bulky cord (this cord is actually not much bigger than an iPad cord and very portable).- Macs seem to make better use of screen space. It's hard to look at an 11-in Macbook and realize that's the same screen size as Windows netbooks. Multiple desktops, smart use of full-screen and fast gestures to navigate them help a lot.- Light and well built. Macs are known for this and it's no joke.

(Base OS install is about 12 GB; another 20 for included apps, Photoshop, MS Office, Xcode; 10s of GBs more for music, and that space goes quick). You really need to think about what files you need to keep on your computer and shift some to external backup drives. The extra space would all be available for downloads, pics, files.- There are still some things the iPad does more intuitively with dedicated apps, like keeping your Facebook current and Pandora playing.- More RAM. I'm not a power user but there are times I think I've got too much going on.- Retina display would be nice.Bottom line: With an external drive this makes a perfectly fine desktop replacement if you don't run ridiculously intensive apps -- you probably know who you are -- and if you're not a gamer. It seems every bit as good as the base MacBook Pro model. With the discounts, this wasn't a choice between this and higher MacBooks but a choice between this and midrange Windows laptops.

The Air is PERFECT for my use.- It is SO LIGHT. So light. I just can't believe how portable this computer is. I use a MacBook Pro for work, and the Pro feels like a huge brick compared to the Air. I do a lot of casual web surfing and work alike on the couch with the laptop on my lap, and the Air is just perfect for that.

Right now I am just doing web surfing and I have 83% left...which it says is 10 hours and 49 minutes. My brightness is at a little less than half, which is how I usually keep it, because I don't like high brightness and that really kills the battery life. Although even with the highest brightness, This Air would last several hours on one charge.- It turns on and off in a a second or two. When I press the power button the computer is on SO quickly, it's unreal. Gone are the days of waiting for various programs to boot up. The Air gives instant gratification.- It's silent. Truly.

I seem to get around 8 through basic uses such as web browsing or typing on Pages. I do a little light gaming but nothing big.After that the mac is a sleek, thin, and speedy computer. That kind of makes it sound like a race car, but it is in fact a laptop computer... not a race car.  It would be cool if it transformed into a car though.I can't say I do anything to push this thing to it's limits such as any 3d imaging or current gen high end gaming on it, so I can't comment on any of that crap.  For what I do though it is very fluid. pages load, menus transition, and magic happens on my screen without any lag.  It's really quite nice. Well.. in fact it's pretty close to great because its so light that I can hold it on my lap without it seeming like a oil filled space heater burning my skin.I do honestly have to say I am impressed with this laptop. It defines mobility and power like advertised.  Sure it's not an alienware or a fully upgraded macbook pro, but it does have a lot of power under it's petite frame. Of course boobs would help, but it's not a human girl so i'm cool with that.I completely recommend this hunk of aluminum.  It's sturdy, lasts most of the day, has a high quality look and replicates that in function as well.If you don't have a significant other in your life it'll fill in that empty space.

They work flawlessly and the customer service and technical support are exceptional.  I have literally five PC laptops, all from the same manufacturer - a well known brand.  And while I would buy another one from this manufacturer if I was to ever get another PC, there is no way I could ever do that to myself or my clients.  Why?1. Mac's boot up quickly and consistently.  I had a one year old PC laptop in great condition.  From the time I booted up the computer to the time the document loaded into my email, 7 minutes passed!  On my Mac, it's about 30 seconds, even the one that's over a year old.  No issues over time.2. Battery life - PC battery life is about 2 hours maximum. I get 3 times that and more from my Mac, even one that I've had for over a year.3. Support - got a problem, take it to the Apple Store. I had an issue with the new one.  Took it in and within 8 hours it was diagnosed, fixed, and back in my hands for free.4. Impressive - the impression people get when they see me pull out my Mac is that I mean business, I've stepped up my game, and that I can get the job done.The other day, my wife was complaining about how slow her PC was after a year of ownership.  She was trying to place an order online and couldn't.  I gave her my Mac to try; within 2 minutes, she had the order completed.  It was her computer, not the website.So, if you want a computer that is problem free, impressive, and just simply works, get a Mac.  If you don't have enough stress in your life and have plenty of time to sit and wait, then get a PC.", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great for daily usage, but also for Djing!", "Author": "Erico", "ReviewID": "R257EUVK2THB3H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This computer is just incredible!I bought it to work with some of my personal projects, being one of them djing.

Phones, Lap Tops, Computers, iPads, and iPods Even with a few glitches at times here and their all Apples products are reliable and durable.One amazing about the Mac is the light weight it has. Being a college student and always needing my lap top attached to my hip, I don not want a heavy 10 pound laptop. I want something durable and light that I can just throw into my backpack or purse and not notice the weight difference. With the light weight I can take is any where and everywhere and it barley takes up any space either.But one thing I love the most is the 12 hour battery life. I am able to do work all day long on the go and I don't have to worry about my battery life and loosing all my work I worked on. Being on the go and not always near a power source is hard when it comes to keeping things charged.A add on though for the Mac is the 2 usb sources instead of 1. Having 2 usb ports is such a life save when it comes to a college student or even just a person always on the go. I can charge my phone 24/7 while I put in a a usb to save and transfer all my school work.Having a Mac book pro is one of the most amazing things for being a college. I love having it with me to be able to always look things up. I can carry around a lap top with no problem at all.

W7-Pro does not have it.  I had Windows 7 Pro.  So I upgraded to W8 Pro via employer provided license.  What a huge mistake.  Windows 8 is the worst operating system I have seen in many years.  Even early Linux was friendlier.  Ugly design, confusing , settings all over the place, split personality, etc.  Then I thought, well , my wife is really used to Windows, so I considered getting a Windows 7 Ultimate license.  Then I found that in order to have full disk encryption you need TPM module in your computer, or you need to boot from USB drive every time.  Mine doesn't have it.  I considered Tru-Crypt, but I will not install a software that I have no idea who writes it and very few smart people in the world are able to build from source.2) I want easy back-ups.  Time machine is really hard to beat in ease of use.  Plug in a USB drive, you're done.For some people the two above reasons might not be relevant, but for me they are.Back to the MBA 11\".What I like:-Solid build.  Aluminum.-Magsafe power connector.  Very easy to plug , unplug. Compact. \"Looks\" safe.  Haven't tried pulling it, but the MBA will probably fly .-USB3, but you can get this on most new laptops.-Thunderbolt is there, even though I use it as mini display port.-Camera is pretty good for what I use it (Skype etc)-It's very light and easy to carry.-I love the size.  Compared to my Macbook Pro 13\", it's much lighter and easier to carry.  If we are going to do serious work we need a bigger screen anyway, so no need to carry a 13\" around (more on the screen below)-Battery life is excellent.-Runs pretty cool, so far.-Mac OS has a consistent user interface (on par with W7, but much better than W8)-Airport Mirroring.  Mirror almost anything to the AppleTV if you have one.-Full easy-to-use full disk encryption (FileVault 2)-Instant on as you open the lid.-Time machine painless backups (and encrypted as well).-Bundled software (iPhoto, iMovie etc)-Cheap upgrades (OS X)-Backlit keyboard-Very secure OS.  Don't even need an antivirus if you use common sense.-No bloatware. Default install is clean, no propaganda slowing down or confusing you.-You can choose the language.-Only one OS.  No Starter vs Pro vs Ultimate nonsense.What I don't like:- The screen is OK but I think Apple could fit a slightly larger screen in the same space.  The metal frame around the screen is pretty thick.- Not a fan of shiny screens, prefer matte.- Kind of expensive.  For this price it could have at least longer warranty.Overall a great notebook.  I would give it a 4 1/2 but I can't , so I give it a 5", "Date": "August 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent product.

A few days later a friend came over with his Acer c720. It's also 11 inches. I noticed it's been the number one selling laptop on Amazon for a while now. I was extremely impressed with the 4 second startup time and the 9 hr battery life. It also wakes up after going into sleep mode. His laptop is easily as fast as the macbook air if not faster. But the deal breaker for me was that the acer is 1/5th the price of the macbook air. I ended up returning the mac and bought the acer and I've been thrilled. It can't do everything the mac can do but it does about 98% of what I was doing on the mac so for me it's perfect. I'm knocking 1 star for the sleep issue and 2 more for the inflated price.

I just get a black screen with a mouse cursor button and unable to get any response by pressing any buttons, including the power button. Just have to sit there and wait for the computer to come back from the ether...Second issue is the keyboard - although the thinness is pretty incredible and great for portability, this is the LEAST ergonomically designed computer I've ever used! After less than a minute of typing on this super flat keyboard, my wrists are KILLING me and I'm young! It physically hurts to keep my hands on the keyboard - the chassis is far too thin - the distance between the edge of the computer to the start of the keyboard is literally 1.5x longer than any other laptop - so almost half my forearm rests on the computer in order to type. I should only have to put my wrists and hands on the computer to type. I end up using my horrible, clunky Lenovo work computer to do any serious typing or even gchatting with friends because it's just not worth it physically to me to do anything but browse the net or watch videos on this thing. The pain is too much.Finally, the newly designed power adaptor SUCKS. You so much as look at the thing, and it falls out. You cannot use the laptop in your lap while it's plugged in because the power cord falls out of the side of the thing. It's seriously the worst design I've ever seen.

After speaking with both online support and the store, there was no dispute that the card was supposed to be activated.  Apple's high-tech solution: take the time from your day to travel to the store to have them do what they should have done in the first place.  This is hardly the old type of apple service.

Apple has implemented an aberrant pricing policy that varies widely from the industry standard pricing policy for professional software.  Apple, in true corporate fashion, has made this change without warning or notice.  The new policy is NO PATH TO UPGRADE.  You heard me right.  If you pay professional software prices for a piece of Apple software, and two months later they release the new and improved package, you will be stuck paying full price for the upgrade.  Do you feel like you got a deal now?  You have now paid more for your software than if you had gone with the industry leading software package (PreSONUS, Adobe Premiere, CorelDraw, etc.) and next update, you will be well behind the pricing curve.  I do not have a problem with Apple software, but rather the sneaky way in which they implemented the pricing policy.
