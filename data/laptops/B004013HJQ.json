I am currently on HDD number four, and overall machine number two.  Every time I take it in, the HDD has failed, but nothing else.  When it is not completely failing in rather spectacular fashion, the machine works like a charm, although the casing personally feels rather flimsy to me and the trackpad doesn't always sense my finger as well as I would like.  The amount of HDD failures and the subsequent time spent repairing them is unforgivable, however.", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Cece", "ReviewID": "R1626WSQM39CJ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a new laptop nothing too expensive to use for traveling. I love that it has the I7core, also the laptop is not heavy which was another option I was looking for. The only problem I did have was with the wireless for some reason it shows that it was connected but the pages would not load. But I finally figured that out and cannot ask for anything more. I also did not buy this at Amazon, I got it at a local store for less then the price that its showing in this site. I also love the texture on the laptop and the number pad on the right side. Also there are lights near the power button that can be turned on or off. I just wished it had a lighted keyboard other then that I would recommend this laptop.**Update**I have had this laptop for 8 months now and have not encounter the issues the other reviewers have encounter (or claim to encounter). Laptop is still running like new and is very fast indeed,taking care of an item like this goes a long way.", "Date": "October 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Disappointed in Toshiba- Worse Quality ever!", "Author": "ivan", "ReviewID": "RY37NAA6B3J0T", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop less than a year ago as a travel companion. During my first 6 months of ownership, I had to replace the hard drive. This laptop runs HOT and frequently locks up as well. Video drivers continually crashes in the middle to watching a movie or doing some kinda graphic work on Photoshop. NVIDIA 310 graphics adapter sucks on this system.This is one of the worse product Toshiba came out with. This is my third Toshiba laptop and I bought it because of the specs seems like it was top-notch. I love the i7 processor but could barely use it because the system has so much issues. The case is a little fragile and recently I cracked the screen. Now I have to replace that too.On the PRO side, the system is fast when it works. At first I did my video rendering on it and it works like a charm but then I decided to stop doing that because of the frequent lock ups and hard booting.If you go to Toshiba support forum a lot of A665 owners are crying about the overheating issue and the video graphics adapter problem.Save your money, DON\"T buy this laptop. Toshiba, get your act together. I spend $995.00 for this piece of crap.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great laptop", "Author": "Arthur", "ReviewID": "R1KQCI5YD718WC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had this laptop for over a year and it still works perfectly with no problems. the thing about any laptop is that if you take care of it good it will last a very long time. this laptop is perfect for business or gaming!!!", "Date": "June 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great computer except for the bugs", "Author": "Danial Goodwin", "ReviewID": "RMPCG81KTWRLX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this computer about five months ago. One bug is that the brightness increase and decrease buttons do the opposite of what they are supposed to. So, after five minutes of sitting still the computer wanted to go to max brightness instead of of dimness. But, I'm fine with that because there's an easy hack to fix that bug. The biggest problem with this computer is that I can't play games on it. After 15 minutes into a game (either a Shockwave game or League of Legends) the computer turns off due to overheating. I think it gets to around 195 degrees Fahrenheit. I tried propping up the back legs on a flat table and that doesn't help.It's a good computer if you don't play games and you like to keep your hands warm when typing.", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great if you have time to rebuild every month", "Author": "Sun-runner", "ReviewID": "R3PMYVT0PL8FXM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Wanted a high performance laptop and i7 was a plus.  That's where it ended.Hard drive failed after 3 weeks.  I used my Geek Squad repair warranty but they took about 10 days because the machine is `so new' and `doesn't have a standard sized hard drive' they had to send it to the repair depot and `wait for Toshiba to send them the part'.I rebuilt the machine with Win 7 64-bit and here we are again two weeks later with another hard drive failure.  This is unacceptable for a $900 laptop.I know there are some people with fabulous reviews.  Good value, light weight, etc.  But if you depend on your laptop as a primary business computer, consider a different brand - seriously.", "Date": "December 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY!!
