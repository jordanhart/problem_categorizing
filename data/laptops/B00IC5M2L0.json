{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Gotta Take the Good with the Bad", "Author": "Robin Sena", "ReviewID": "R36WMU67BE2GV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This laptop is hard to grade with a star system.  There are qualities which are desirable, and some that are very frustrating.  I've decided to give an account of this computer component by component for those wanting to know a little more.This laptop certainly hits a sweet spot - price.  Most of its purchasers will be interested in getting a good budget laptop which can handle basic needs.  'Basic' here is the key word though.  This laptop contains Intel's Celeron processor, which was not designed to be their marquee chip.  Its a cheaper processor, and it definitely shows at times.  Even right out of the box, the computer wasn't necessarily all that quick - not slow, but not fast by any means either.  As I just received it, I can't comment too much on its versatility, but I can't imagine that it could handle advanced games and video processing all that well.  Celeron processors were not designed for this.  If you understand this going in it will soften the blow of not having the fastest computer around.  (This is very noticeable when transferring via USB - not too sure what is more to blame, but items don't copy over as quick as I thought.)With that said, it should be noted that the 4 GB of RAM are more than sufficient - any slowness is not attributable to that.  The computer has run cleanly so far without any hangups, and I'm happy with that.The hard drive size is always an issue.  The 500 GB advertised is actually about 444 GB out of the box (a common practice in hard drive advertising), and after formatting and operating system space, it was down to about 420 GB (or perhaps even less), and I hadn't even installed anything on it yet.The computer comes equipped with a DVD/CD drive which is a plus (optical drives are fast disappearing from the computer landscape), but with the advent of blu-ray, it makes it seem a bit dated. The optical drive can be a little difficult to open - the button for the release isn't very sensitive, and the drive itself seems very cheap, even by budget laptop standards.  I expect this to be the first thing to break down as the computer ages.The operating system it shipped with was Windows 8, and not 8.1 as advertised.  Not a big deal for me as I've grown accustomed very quickly to it, though you might have some major updating to do once it arrives.  For those who haven't experienced the newest versions of Windows, it is definitely different, but just like with anything else, you will get used to it, so don't get too angry with it.The look of the laptop is a little plain, though the finish on the top of the laptop is very nice.  The keyboard is arranged well, but what I find annoying is the sensitivity of some mystery hot keys which whisk me around the various Windows screens - very frustrating when working on a document; you can't get too involved in a piece of work without hitting some key inadvertently and being taken away to some other screen.  The screen is sharp in color and texture though, and presents images and videos very well.  The 15+ inch screen is a good size and certainly justifies the purchase even if there isn't any touch based capabilities.All told, this computer is worth it for those who want a solid budget laptop who don't do anything especially computer intensive.  If you're into that sort of stuff, go for a computer with a more advanced chip.", "Date": "April 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worked an hour and a half", "Author": "lela b", "ReviewID": "R2C1EG54QEOFRF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this computer for work, easy enough huh? No. Although it is lightweight and I love the keyboard, this computer was a dud.

When the computer arrived, I read the one pamphlet that came with it and plugged the laptop in. When it was fully charged, I began the task of set up. All went well, the computer was just what I needed. About an hour to an hour and a half later, the screen blipped and the computer shut down.

Amazon doesn't let me give half a star. I would give a 7/10 instead of a 6/10. My bigger issue is that Amazon is charging $329.99 for a laptop that I just picked up for $249.99. At the price of $329.99, I can't recommend this laptop because other laptops are available at better prices.PROCESSORNow people have been asking about the Celeron processor inside. I was slightly disappointed in that it was based off the Bay Trail/Atom series instead of the Haswell series. It caught me off guard in that I thought it was going to be a horribly slow processor. Fortunately, this is NOT the case. The Intel Celeron N2815 is more than capable of handling day to day activities such as browsing the internet, opening Office applications, watching Netflix, and play low demand games such as Minecraft. This is not as slow as the Celeron processors from decades ago. Architecture and engineering has come a long way in that processors these days are all decently strong for every day tasks. For the price of the laptop, you will get enough performance to complete casual activities.This processor isn't really made to run high end games off its integrated graphics set up. It's also not made to do high end video and photo work. It may also chug if you try to run too many applications at once. If you were looking for these things in the first place, you really shouldn't be searching for budget laptops in the first place. You would probably want an i3 processor minimum for higher end tasks and performance.GRAPHICSThe integrated graphics will not get you very far as it's a bit weak. However, it does run games like Minecraft at a decent frame-rate. Slower performance will be given at games at high quality settings. This integrated GPU will not run high end games at acceptable frame rates. If you want a laptop that can run mid range games I would consider getting a higher priced laptop. If you do a fresh Windows install, make sure you update the drivers for the Iris graphics. I noticed a fresh install was horribly slow with graphics until I downloaded the drivers. Then it went back to being fast.BUILD QUALITYI both like and dislike the build. I like the design, feel, keyboard, and layout. It's very nice and feels professional. However, I dislike the very closed case. Unlike other ASUS laptops, you can not access the hard drive/RAM from the back of the laptop. For this laptop, you have to manually unscrew the entire back. This is slightly difficult as there are screws that are very difficult to remove. After this, you need to remove the top keyboard plate by pulling up the sides. This can be slightly scary as you may feel that you're going to break it. After this, to replace the hard drive you have to unscrew it. You may remove the ribbons in the process which is a huge pain to put together as I've never seen those types of cables before. For first time users, replacing parts of a laptop can be a huge nightmare.OTHERThe 4GB RAM is enough. You're not really doing complex activities on this machine as the processor isn't really made for it so the 4GB shouldn't be a bottleneck. The hard drive is a slower 5400RPM but when I first used it, it didn't seem terribly slow. It was ok for normal activities but I personally replaced mine with an SSD. This allows for snappy performance. The screen quality is decent. The resolution is lower than 1080p but it's still good. The viewing angles are a bit poor. If you're not personally using the laptop and viewing someone else using it, it can become a blur.NOTES OF WINDOWS 8/8.1I personally do a fresh install as I hate bloatware that manufacturers insist to put on their laptops. I don't need fancy software or 3rd party programs built in. It actually ends up slowing down the system because the system is allocating its resources to other programs that run in the background. For the Celeron processor, this probably isn't a good idea as it can give the false impression in that it can't handle the OS but it's just the bloatware taking up the resources. Do a fresh install or uninstall the software.This laptop ships with 8.0 so you have to update it to 8.1. While it does take time, the process is easy as all you have to do is download some updates and then use the Windows store to upgrade it for free.CONCLUSIONThis laptop is great for budget uses such as work, school, or just a gift for kids. However, I DO NOT like the price Amazon is offering it at so I can not recommend it to be purchased from Amazon. I picked up a bundle for a local store for $259.99. This came with the laptop, a mouse, and a laptop case. Now for about $70 more, you can get less at Amazon? Doesn't seem right. This is especially true when other laptops that include an i3 processor can be gotten for slightly more than this Amazon price. The value is incredibly poor from Amazon. If you can find it cheaper elsewhere at sub $280, then I would go for it.While the processor is weaker, it does its job for every day tasks. The graphics get by for simple games such as Minecraft and can run the OS well. The hard to get into case may not be a problem for everyone if you just plan on buying a laptop and not tinkering around with it. For school, work, or kids this laptop is decent enough. The one I purchased from a store also came with a DVD Drive which is pretty cool for a budget laptop as even more expensive laptops are getting rid of them.", "Date": "May 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "terrible customer support and product build", "Author": "jdbj34m", "ReviewID": "R1R7I8TOR572GE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i bought one of these units and the first one turne don once, then would not turn on again.so i returned this laptop and got a second unit. the second unit has an issue with the hidden recovery partition, not only does it not work but i cant make a physical copy (such as dvd or usb drive) because of the recovery drive. so i contacted asus and they had the nerve to tell me i had to pay to send the unit in for repair.  i for one do not understand why asus simply cannot just send me a dvd backup copy,it would be cheaper than the solution they came up with.i have heard asus has started using cheaper ram and motherboards, and now i beleive asus quality is not there. but the bigger issue is the product support. save yourself some trouble and buy a brand with better build quality and customer support/service.", "Date": "May 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wonky but works", "Author": "Will Napoli", "ReviewID": "R28VT6UU40RCPR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First, I'm loving the speed of a new laptop running Windows 8 (downloaded separately). However, I find the mouse pad built into the keyboard a bit wonky. The cursor floats a lot and because all three surfaces (mouse, left-click, and right-click) are under one physical surface the cursor tends to float away as the user clicks. I'm getting used to the slight differences in keyboard layout (as well as the major differences in Windows 8), but it remains difficult to easily control the cursor. I'm considering resorting to a separate mouse! I did have one unexpected power-off event and found that none of the backup saves stuck so that several hours of work was lost. I was able to recreate it, but it was frustrating. Still, I don't know the reason for the momentary power loss. The screen is nice and wide. I'm not sure if it's me or the keys, but they don't always respond as I expect, but this doesn't happen often. I may just need more time to get used to the touch. The price was nice, but if I had a second chance I'd hold out for something a little more solidly built.", "Date": "April 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Dead after 2 months", "Author": "anewman", "ReviewID": "R3F2ATBFL1I3WA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It was a decent laptop (Even though Windows 8 is a huge disappointment and pain in the ...)
