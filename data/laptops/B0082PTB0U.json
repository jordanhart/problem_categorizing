I may have received a lemon that doesn't represent this product line, butwas dismayed to find so much negative commentary in the U410's forum on the Wifi issue.", "Date": "July 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love the laptop- just be aware of wifi flaw!", "Author": "J. Woodward", "ReviewID": "R2F16C5XLDOMY0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hi everyone, I have had this beautiful laptop for a week now. It is a quality built laptop (made of aluminum alloy) and is often compared to the mac due to its quality build. It has windows 8 which I am getting used to (coming from Windows Vista). I love the 3.0 USBs X2. You do not know how important having those is, especially when I am transferring data constantly for homework and projects for engineering. Extremely lightweight and portable which is important for me since I am moving between classes and carrying this on my backpack all day- need something light. No \"optical\" drive, or CD ROM drive for playing movies/cd's/etc- know that when you are buying this since it is for making it lighter weight; one can work around this by burning the CD on another laptop and transferring via USB OR by buying an external CD ROM. I might need to purchase an external CD ROM since I desire to download photoshop... and there are 8 CD's. Good to know and be informed as you are deciding..But, there is a design flaw in terms of the wi-fi. I was aware of an extremely common wi-fi issue coming from Lenova U series (includes this U410 and U310). People would complain that they have either 1) a disconnecting wi-fi internet problem 2) low signals until very close to wi-fi access.My theory is that since the casing of the laptop is almost 100% thin aluminum, the metal casing is reducing the wi-fi strength. In other words, the wi-fi adaptor is like your cell phone trying to text inside a metal elevator casing- reducing the signal or losing it frequently. Also like when you go through a tunnel. Maybe the design flaw is because they are almost mimicking the mac's metal chassis and they failed mimicking on one key part... like allowing an opening for the wi-fi antenna....Regardless- My love for this laptop will outweigh returning the laptop- for now- as I am currently purchasing an external wi-fi antenna USB. An antenna will test my hypothesis of whether it is the whole casing, which is the design flaw, or if the brand new network adaptor sucks (unlikely but possible).Keep you posted.Edit: 12/6/2012Design flaw averted by simply adding on cheap external wifi adapter. Acts like an antenna to get better signals than many laptops. Yay!I bought a CISCO Lynksis external wi-fi adapter for $49.99- even though on best buy I saw it for half off. I needed internet ASAP, so I went for it (I can always order the cheaper version, then return with receipt for the current to save 25$ once it arrives)- it works! I can even access my n network now. My download speed went from 0MB to 8.6MB; Upload speed from 0MB to 3.6MB on [...]I tentatively recommend getting this laptop and investing in a $10-50 external wifi.Edit: 8/15/2013DO NOT GET A CISCO Lynksis external wi-fi adapter!It is beautiful until it snaps off. It's long extension knocks into any thing near it (my girlfriend, the wall, people walking by, etc.) Here is the review link:http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R6U9F61SMVW0/ref=cm_cr_ryp_det?ie=UTF8&channel;=rypI recommend a shorter, cheaper one.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Exactly what I want!", "Author": "Luiz Belonio", "ReviewID": "R1942GRPD1DKUK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works fine, is a great machine and all of my expectations are attended.Some guys talk some bla bla bla about the Wi-Fi... works perfect with me.", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best you can get for the price.", "Author": "Valdir", "ReviewID": "R1FT7CIMS1ECWY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I absolutely love this laptop.

What I love the most about this laptop is the track-pad, finally a PC manufacturer has gotten it right. It's big and responsive and the multitouch is fantastic if only a little too touchy meaning sometimes with a little pinch I accidentally expand too far. Games like Starcraft and Diablo run great on medium to high graphics.My only grievances is with the bloatware!!!!! No one has ever bought a laptop and thanked the manufacturer for putting so many crappy programs on it. EVERYBODY who knows how to use Windows spends the first hour with any new comp uninstalling all the useless junk.

One word of advice: you should really uninstall the \"Lenovo Smart Update\" software.  It is a cpu hog and, therefore, will make the weak battery-life of this pc even shorter.NOTE: There are lots of reports on these laptops (and many others) having bad wifi cards.  Mine does not and, so far, seems to get a similar signal strength as my older laptops both close and far from the router.  This article [...] seems to indicate that the problem was solved after 7/23/2012.  The date on the box that my unit was packed in is 7/28/2012 so maybe amazon has gotten rid of the faulty ones (or maybe I just got lucky).On to the review . . .I've only had it 2 days so far but so far so good.  It's a very good price for a 3rd gen i5 with 6gb and the hybrid hd.  There's a version on amazon with an i3 and 4gb for the same price.  Why?  Anyway . . .PROS:-Keyboard. Very comfy and well-laid-out with better travel than most laptops in its class.  That's a Lenovo specialty.-Huge trackpad.  Works great and rejects unintentional palm contact while typing extremely well.  Multi-finger gestures are also responsive.-Speed.  Boots to login in under 20 sec, login to a desktop that's actually READY TO USE in under another 20.  That's the hybrid hd 32gb ssd cache at work.  That's great for me and I'd rather have the much better storage/price ratio of the platter hd compared to a full ssd anyway.-Power.  3rd gen i5 and 6gb is just a treat to work on.-Connectivity. 2 usb 3.0's, 2 usb 2.0's, full-size hdmi, ethernet etc.  Lots of corners are cut here on other brands.GAMING:-I love video games.  In fact, I love them so much that I have a kickass desktop machine with a nice big monitor so I don't have to subject myself to playing games on a laptop.  And you shouldn't either.CONS:-Screen.  It's perfectly usable but, well, it's a weak point for this otherwise powerful little guy.  Most laptops at this price point still have the same low screen resolution and mediocre viewing angle, though, so watcha gonna do?  It works ok but better would be . . . better.-Pointless nvidia GPU when the Intel HD4000 graphics already included on 3rd gen core processors are just as good.  What was Lenovo thinking?  Like other reviewers, I disabled the nvidia card in device manager. Hopefully that will provide a bit less battery drain.  Which brings me to . . .-Battery life.  I really need to try to optimize things and test it for my uses but it appears to fall far short of the advertised \"up to 9 hours.\"  There is NO FREAKIN' WAY this thing could go for 9 hours of even the lightest possible use.  At least the power supply is small and portable.OVERALL:  Very happy.  I'll update if necessary, though.  I have not had occasion to contact Lenovo customer support and I hope I never do.  These days, the thought of contacting any company's customer support makes me shudder.Final Note:  I just LOVE reviews that say \"Wow! It's so much faster than my 7-year-old Dell!\"  Thank you, Captain Obvious.", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "ok laptop when it is not in the shop", "Author": "Terry Vattimo", "ReviewID": "R3VWAHFXHYCYMQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've had this computer in for repair twice in less than a year of owning it.

In fact it sets us back to the times of Windows 3.1.

I am a big user of Lenovo in the workplace and thought it would be great for home use.  Just not the case, the support line and support documentation is not consumer friendly.  In fact a number of the downloads they have that supposedly could fix my issues once loaded say that my hardware is not supported for this download.

You may find yourself positioning the screen at an angle that is OK to look at.The battery does NOT last up to 8hrs no matter what the settings are... do not believe in this marketing scam.Although misleading, there is NO bluetooth either.Second:Do not hope for any support coming from Lenovo. They are very aware of the wifi problem but they have yet to find out what exactly solves this issue. Unless you are willing to send your brand new machine back to service and to be gutted in order to assess the problem, be my guest. Customers all over the world have been experiencing this problem but no solution has actually been found.Third:I bought this ultrabook in California, however, I live in Brazil. Lenovo Brazil DOES NOT provide ANY support and it is not possible to buy the extended warranty for this particularly model. Be careful is Lenovo doesn't support the U310/U410 in your country either.Fourth:Lenovo seems to be joking around with customers all over the globe. They have not taken these defective models out of the stores, instead, they keep selling it to anyone who is willing to pay for it. I'm no American, but this doesn't really appeal to me as a fair and honest company. Shame on you Lenovo!I can't stress enough how frustrating it is to deal with Lenovo once you buy this notebook. The wifi does only 'work' on models manufactured after 7/23/2012 as an administrator at lenovo.com has stated, so you have been warned.Save yourself some time and trouble by spending a hundred dollars more to get the ASUS UX31A, now that's an ultrabook!I hope I can help you guys shopping for a new ultrabook.", "Date": "September 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "not as expected", "Author": "Xingkang Huang", "ReviewID": "RU27AZCQX9ZXV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is very light.
