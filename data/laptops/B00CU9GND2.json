But it has been a few years since I purchased a new gaming PC so I went back to basics and looked into a lot of the different options out there.Does Alienware make a more powerful gaming PC?? Yes. Is it worth paying the $4000+ retail price? Absolutely NOT!  Besides who needs dual graphics cards anyways thats just stupid and bound to go wrong sorry Alienware but deep down you know its just a pointless overpriced gimmick. One solid GPU is all you need and you'll run cooler and save money.Bottom line if you compare the asking prices on an MSI to many of the other quality custom gaming PC manufacturers out there it is the best bang for the buck. I purchased it back in December absolutely no issues. The build quality is very good. My fiance bought a Toshiba that still doesn't have the specs or performance that this baby has but touted it as being $400 cheaper which yes it was.However If I sneeze on the couch next to her the Toshiba's power cord falls out! I swear its true! It also runs consistently over 140'F which yes the new intel quad cores are designed to be able to run at but even intel says you should not maintain that temperature for extended periods and not expect significant loss of chipset life. Its a joke! Yes I know that each chipset even in the same exact computer can produce different temps because of the manufacturing process but im sorry that is just ridiculous and when it burns out in a yr then my MSI is by far cheaper then two Toshibas sorry hunny :PMy MSI will sit right around 100'F-110'F if I turn on the coolboost while playing even the most extreme games. Which is perfectly in the temp sweetspot for the new intel quads. And if i'm not gaming and just browsing the net it sits usually just over room temp. These are truly quality built machines with tons of performance I play a huge array of different games from some of the simplest indie games all the way up to COD and BF4 and COH2 and ESO and many other big performers that test even the best of GPUs. I consistently see 60+fps or higher on most of these games even with graphics turned high. If I had to find a complaint I guess it would be with the network card. The killer is a fast card don't get me wrong but in an age of many other available wireless bands why am I stuck using G? However do some tweaking with your router and find the right channel and you'll have solid ping all day long too.My point here folks is if your feeling the itch and want to get a quality gaming laptop but do not want to have to mortgage your house to do it.... you can't go wrong with this. If you just need a PC to do your homework on or browse facebook or your latest internet dating fad then your insane for even looking at anything but a $400 ASUS. But in my humble opinion as of right now MSI makes the best all around gaming laptop for your money and if you do your homework you will see that a lot of tech sites agree with me.Well that's my rant hope it helps you in making your choice...

This laptop is just amazing, for the money you pay you will get awesome specs that are only available in very expensive laptops from other brands, the laptop runs smooth with no issues, heat is also maintained by very good fans which can be put on settings from low to high, the games you run through this beast are just amazing, you can throw any recent game at it with highest settings with no problems at all (am currently playing FFXIV: ARR) thanks to the GTX780 GPU, I made a search for a month before buying a gaming laptop for me and found this one over the top list, if anyone is hesitant, don't be, get this and you wont regret it and keep in mind that it runs Windows8 which is not bad imo but needs time to get use to. hope this help fellow buyers.", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fastest Machine I ever seen", "Author": "D.

That said, I had to put a review out there to warn folks.I got the computer and it was fast and well appointed.  But within a few hours of getting things set up, the HDMI stopped working. I thought it was a the cord.  Got a new one.  Still didn't work.  So, I tried the DisplayPort.  It worked.  Yay!  I figured I could live without the HDMI as long as I didn't lose the DisplayPort too.A few hours after that, I was playing Skyrim, getting that set up the way I liked it and...game freeze.  Not unheard of with Skyrim, so I blamed the game.  I tweaked and played with it, but it just got worse.  After about an hour of fiddling, the machine got blazing hot and I got a video card error message.  Mmm, not Skyrim's fault after all.I called the vendor that sold me the computer and they confirmed that my video card was in the process of dying.  So, the computer was basically a dud.I know this happens but, this was the second MSI laptop to die within hours of ownership.  (I will post a review for that machine as well.) I got an RMA for the comp, so I'm not going to criticize MSI's customer service.  But, their quality control leaves a great deal to be desired.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "UNBIASED TRUTHFUL REVIEW FROM PURCHASER OF THIS EXACT UNIT.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R27D8MP2TK7P9M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This newer GT70 series are the most powerful well rounded  single graphics card laptops on the planet for what you pay for it period, and if MSI could have better quality control for there hardware and software as well as compatibility of parts I would no doubt give this PC a 5 star review but the one I received had a few problems I with it and I must tell people so they no and so hopefully MSI will know and fix these problems so this PC can be the awesome monster it should be. With this being said I am going to try my luck with the next level model up from this that has almost all the same parts and if that one fails too then I will review it as well to let people know but about it but since amazon is refunding my money for the PC I'm gonna go for it again and find out if this was an isolated problem or and abundant one. Look below for pros cons and more detail of my review. NEGATIVES- Windows 8 was only supposed to take up 24 GB of my SSD when its updated but some how it used up 40 GB.- When I delete items from my hard drive some how they were still taking up some or all of the space after being deleted.- I had to spend hours and hours messing with this pc to try to get it to work properly but could not get it to do so.- Windows 8 is rumored to use up to 8GB of ram sometimes so you better have A lot more than that.- Windows 8 has a new interface and everything is not where it used to be in previous windows and it did not have a tutorial to  teach me how and what to use it so I had to Google how to use some of the stuff in Windows 8.- Some of the Programs on the PC wont start up till 60 seconds after the PC is at the windows desktop screen.- The PC Would run STARCRAFT 2 1920X1080 AA2 AF4 60-90FPS depending on what part of the game your in but there were times in this game and in other where for no reason the game will drop to single digits or teens for frame rate for no reason and it happend at least 5-10 times an hour and sometimes A lot more and would stay constant, I believe this was caused by an overheating graphics card or some form of incapability in this PC of hardware or software and I came to this conclusion after updating my drivers all across the system witch lessened this affect but was still happening far to often but after I turned a Hi powered personal fan on my PC the problem minimized even more to almost nothing especially if I turn on the AC in my house.- The battery cannot supply the PC to run at full power at all and when you max out what it can hand you have around an hour of gaming, 1.5 hours for movie and 2 hours for internet Ive seen some reviews that say they got these numbers up about 1/3rd but they just turned down all the power and brightness settings.- Can some times disconnect people on your wifi when you power up your pc but this might be something going in with my router as well but it is a brand new 300$ router so might be compatibility problem. POSITIVES+ GTX 780M The single most powerful mobile graphics card on earth as of today and more power effeciant than last gen cards.+ 16GB DDR3 1600MHZ+ 4th Gen i7 quadcore processor that is more effecient than previous generation i7's.+ The best bang for the buck for single graphics laptops.+ SSD with normal HDD so you can have the best of both worlds with speed for games and space for all else.+ Nice 1080p screen.+ USB 3.0 for fast data transfer from 3.0 capable devices.+ killer lan that works great most of the time.+ Beautiful and awesome multi color programable keyboard with little to no imput lag most of the time except startup. 1-10 RATINGS FOR THE PC WHEN ITS WORKING RIGHT LOL.8.0 GRAPHICS, You can get about 2 times the power from a dual 780m but you will have to go 18 inch and spend $4000+.8.0 SOUND,  You get great stereo sound from the laptop speakers but will need a nice head set to get surround sound.8.5 WIFI, ETHERNET, BLU TOOTH, all work fast if your at the right range and have no interference as far as I can tell but some times they will have some problems like when you turn on your pc you can disconnect people on your wifi lol.9.0 KEY BOARD, Little to no input lag and its beautiful.9.0 TOUCH PAD, Works better than any Touch pad I have ever used but its a touch pad so it still sucks for gaming lol.8.0 SCREEN, 1080p 60hz and it looks nice but it is not the cleanest looking, most colorful or brightest but still good.9.0 HEAT FROM TOP OF PC, Your hand will be very dry and comfy on the keyboard.7.0 HEAT FROM THE BOTTOM WHILE ON YOUR LAP. It will get pretty warm on the left side where the graphics card is.10.0 PRICE FOR THE MONEY.I hope this review helps people who are looking at a gaming PC and dont stop with my review or amazon look around at other people and websites to see what other love and hate before you buy.", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Do not buy MSI", "Author": "jrooney", "ReviewID": "R104MJL29WKMKZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The products are quality with some great thought into the design & parts. I would say overall the performance is 4 outta 5 stars.MSI does not offer replacement keyboards on their \"Steelseries\" version laptops nor does Steelseries. You have to send it in for \"service\" which has a 2 week turnaround. I will not pay to have someone else to do such a simple task that I have done hundreds of times. Replacing a keyboard is simple. Nor will I send in my laptop for 2 weeks. That's ridiculous.There are no aftermarket replacement keyboards either. Do not buy. I have officially boycotted all MSI products because of this. I have burned 5+hours with support from both MSI and Steelseries on this problem.Buy from a manufacturer who offers replacement parts.
