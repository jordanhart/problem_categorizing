{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Totally Love it!", "Author": "Tell the Truth", "ReviewID": "RN9W367FPDG1E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop a few years ago and it was absoulutely awesome!  It was listed with Dell as a gaming computer and it was good for games as well as all of the work related things I needed to do.  Just under 5 pounds it was pretty easy to tote around when i was on work related trips.  This model is the last XPS that Dell made with a 12.1 screen.  The dementions of this laptop is a nice \"in-between\" size: it is a bit bigger than a netbook but also a bit smaller than a laptop with a 13\" screen.This baby has 4 USB ports and that is a bit difficult to find these days. You never think you are going to need all those USB ports until it happens!  The hard drive is upgradable to a 500GB if you want to go that high (I upgraded mine to a 320GB and it worked fine. Everyone that saw it loved it! I even had offers to purchase it but I always  refused!Also, not only is it nearly impossible to find a laptop with this size screen, number of USB ports but to have all of this AND it's Core 2 Duo AND it has a  CD/DVD+RW drive is a dream come true. The only problem that I had was that the regular battery only lasted two years so I had to buy another one.  If that is the only issue with a laptop, I think it's worth it.So if you want something small, but not to small and you want it to have the capacity to handle all the bells and whistles you may later want to add, this is a perfect choice!", "Date": "March 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Older style but very Functional", "Author": "Janet Hearnden", "ReviewID": "R2KF2Z15F6C6J5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just wanted a small laptop for light social media and shopping needs with more versatility than a tablet and this model seems robust and well made. The keyboard has a nice feel. It did come with several software discs, handbook and everything i expect with a new product. . Drawbacks are the older screen presentation with less clarity/sharpness than new models, and every time I start it it, it is adding new configurations. Overall, its very functional, if you don't mind a screen that looks 10 years old.", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Intel Core 2 Duo T5600 at 1.83ghz\n100GB Hard disk\n2GB RAM, DVD +/- RW\nUltra compact and light weight with 12.1\" screen", "Name": "Dell XPS M1210 Core-2-Duo T5600 (1.83ghz) 2GB 100Gb Dvd+/-rw", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515nvV3C5jL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0011G60HY"}}
