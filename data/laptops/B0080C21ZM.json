I got this before the latest Windows disaster came out specifically to upgrade before that. Also, wanted something with a blu-ray player. The blu-ray player feature works great and I was floored by how good the picture quality was when watching movies. The laptop is light enough and small enough that it is easy to travel with. Looking back I'm happy with this purchase and would recommend product if you can still get it with Windows 7.", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sony VAIO Laptop", "Author": "Vladimir Vojvodic", "ReviewID": "RWETNW88WB0OS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a Win7 version of this laptop, and I love it. The apps that Sony is loading are absolutely cool, and I like the fact that now I can control my other Sony devices via this laptop (PS3 or Sony Media Player). The rest is typical, Intel i5 and BluRay. I don't think I will upgrade this to Win8, but that is another story :)", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good price!!!", "Author": "Raul", "ReviewID": "R1654DEGH5R0DD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good laptop for the price!!!!

However, the battery performance has been terrible. So decided to make a change and purchased a Sony this time around after doing some comparing.  I don;t think the Sony is as robust as a similar DV-4 HP, but time will tell.I like the laptop. Backlit keys, large keys, simple keystroke options and sufficient ports for my use.. mainly business emails, documents, calenders etc. So far so good after 2 weeks. Battery time is showing 5+ hrs, which if it stays, will be great.One problem I also have is the touch pad. Extremely frustrating to use. Tried re-setting with no effect. I will have to contact Sony for advise. Clicking once or twice typically has NO response. I purchased a wireless mouse and have solved this problem, but only when using the mouse.  And at times, YOU NEED the touchpad, the reason it is there in the first place.", "Date": "October 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Good Stylish Laptop", "Author": "Vasu", "ReviewID": "RY3J3JXSZVBLX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading so many review about 100s of Laptops finally i decided to go with this laptop and now i am very much satisfied.The system performance is very good, no noise, will not get heated even after running more than 24 hours(one of the review says the system gets heatedup but its not true with all Sony laptops).Display , backlit keyboard are pretty decent, gesture control needs some practice.Overall the experiance with my 1st Sony Laptop purchase is good and i would recommend any one looking for a mid range multimedia laptop.", "Date": "September 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good laptop", "Author": "jessica", "ReviewID": "R2T56KBO17WENW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good laptop. I have it for 3 weeks now and it works fine. One major issue i have with it is the touch pad. I fine i have to tap hard to navigate. This laptop surface gets easily dirty with your finger prints.Lastly , the hard drive size stated on amazon was 750Gb  but  it actually came with 679Gb  with only approximately 659Gb  free space. I guess some space was taken with the apps that it came with. But that still doesn't explain why the hard drive size was not showing 750Gb.", "Date": "September 25, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Intel Core_i5_2450M Processor 2.5GHz\n6  GB DRAM RAM\n750GB 5400rpm  Hard Drive\n14-Inch Screen, Intel HD Graphics 3000\nWindows 7 Home Premium 64-bit", "Name": "Sony VAIO E Series SVE14117FXB 14-Inch Laptop (Sharkskin Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NzhR9SjAL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0080C21ZM"}}
