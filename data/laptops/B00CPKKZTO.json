{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Incredible Value", "Author": "Michael Mccloskey", "ReviewID": "R3CTZVVLIUTI3X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a software developer and was looking for a Windows 8 touchscreen laptop on which to do some Windows 8 development.  I was additionally looking to replace my Asus UL30VT as my occasional travel laptop.  I am an amateur photographer, so I also wanted something with a nice screen that could do at least full HD at 1920 x 1080.  This last consideration narrowed the field quite a bit.After comparing many models and finally ordering and receiving this Sony I can state that I couldn't be happier.  This is such a beautiful machine and such an incredible value for the price.  While Windows 8 is still growing on me, the machine itself is wonderful.  First off, is the screen.  Text and photos look gorgeous.  There is no substitute for pixel density when rendering text and this machine renders text and web pages beautifully.  I loaded up my Nikon photo software to review a number of photos from my D90 and they looked wonderful.  I held out for a 1080p screen because I also like to watch movies.  I loaded up Windows Media Player Home Cinema edition and threw a 1080p MKV at it, which it rendered wonderfully using only about 20% CPU during the busy action scenes with the Intel video chipset.  This had been a point of potential concern for me since there isn't a discrete graphics card in the machine.The sound is just okay, as is generally the case for a laptop.  Certainly acceptable for watching a movie and general use although I wouldn't want to try to rock out to them.  I could have done without the DVD drive, but as an old school programmer and PC user I appreciate having it and am creating system recovery DVD's as I write this.  The variety of ports is also appreciated.  Having a GigE ethernet port was a must for me.  The VGA port was also not required, but is darn nice to have.  The USB-3 port will come in handy for more rapid backups and perhaps occasional device charging.The aluminum chassis, shiny chrome strip and backlit keyboard all add touches of class that make this a thing of beauty as well as a workhorse.", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great laptop for a college student.", "Author": "Carol J. Pollart", "ReviewID": "R1DCER3NC3FNWB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a student going into college in the fall of 2013 and had been searching for a laptop for a very long time.  After months of searching for a laptop that had what I needed AND what I wanted, I finally found the Sony VAIO.Pros:-15.5\" is a great screen size; big enough to watch movies or play games if you want, yet small enough to be portable.-Quick turn-on time due to the solid state drive.  The laptop boots up within 3 seconds at the most.-The screen resolution is solid.  HD movies look beautiful and small words are relatively easy to read.-The touch screen is accurate and smooth and makes Windows 8 easier to use-600 GB of storage space is more than enough for most people-I love that this laptop comes with an HDMI port.  I can hook it up to any TV and the picture is very clear.-The backlit keyboard is useful for using the laptop in the dark.  I'm surprised at how many laptops these days do not have backlit keyboards.-The number pad on the side of the keyboard is a must-have for a college student like me-The keyboard is very sensitive, which could be a good or bad thing depending on the person.  I like having a sensitive keyboard since I have small hands.  Someone with larger hands may find it bothersome.-The design of the laptop looks sleek and professional.Cons:-The touch pad is very loud when you use it to click-The fan can, at times, be somewhat loud-The left side of the bottom of the laptop gets very hot, so don't let it sit on your lap without some kind of pad to put it on.-There is only one USB 3.0 port; I wish there were more.-The speakers aren't the best, but they are tolerable. I use headphones most of the time anyway.-I wish the CD/DVD drive could play Blu-rays.-I don't know how well the battery works or how long it lasts because I have almost always have my laptop plugged in to an outlet.Even though there are some negative aspects to this laptop, I give the VAIO five stars because I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a computer for both work/school and for entertainment purposes like watching movies and playing some simple games. And for a laptop like this, the price is amazing.  I'm overall very pleased with this product.", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Big Disappointment", "Author": "LAshley", "ReviewID": "R26TNSY16XK12W", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research into my laptop purchase and eventually chose this one. A decision which I'm already regretting. I run my own business and work a lot from home, or remotely with my clients. I needed something that was portable, but powerful, and a desktop equivalent in many senses. What I got was a laptop that crashed after 5 weeks and entered a perpetual loop of saying it had encountered an error and needed to restart... restarting, and saying the exact same thing again, so that I could never get it to start up. I took it back to the retailer who said it needed a completely new hard drive and everything on the current hard drive would be lost. Luckily I sought a second opinion at a Sony Store, who ran a system reboot and got it up and running again. Thank goodness. But it continues to shut itself down for no reason at least once a week, has problems starting, and generally just makes me feel nervous that it's going to crash at any point.But by FAR The most annoying thing about this laptop that makes me want to return it every single day, is that it won't hold a WiFi connection. 50% of the time it connects automatically when I log on, the other 50% it doesn't and I have to try and do it manually. But even when it does connect, this often lasts about 10 minutes before it automatically disconnects for no reason (and still says its connected...although I can't open a webpage or send an email). I have to either reboot, or put it into airplane mode then back to normal to restart the WiFi connection. In a normal working day, I probably have to do one of those 2 things at least 20 - 30 times. It's beyond annoying and wastes about 40 minutes of every day just trying to fix the connection. It drives me mad.If I had realised within my 30 day return period, I would have got a full refund and bought a completely different laptop. I feel like I'm stuck with this one, and every time I take it in to get these problems looked at they update the software and say it should be fixed. It never is. In my opinion this is a massive fault with the machine, and having Googled it more since my purchase, it seems it's not an uncommon one either.I had a very basic Toshiba notebook for 4 years prior to this Sony, and didn't have a single problem with it. Very disappointing.", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "just OK laptop", "Author": "thecharcuterer", "ReviewID": "R17KSC5P4UMZGZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Although true high resolution display, the monitor has a washed-out display from most angles.

This is the worst laptop I've ever owned.  Very frustrating operating system. Have an HP with win 7 and it works flawless.  This does not has sound through the HDMI connection.

Without the mouse is is diffucult to select multpule files, drag and drop into other files.  Using the screen, the touch pad to right click and a keyboard is ackward.  Also short of miss the ablity to window view applications to copy and paste between.Update 10-21-2013 after searching on the web discovered a solution to the sound problem consisting of reinstalling a intel sound driver.

For me the i5 was more than enough power. The display is crisp, although it has a narrow vertical viewing angle- it washes out pretty quickly if too high or low, while horizontal doesn't seem to suffer as much. DVD works fine- backlit keyboard is wonderful (after suffering in the dark for too long). I am trying not to be a Windows 8 hater, but it's really hard. 8.1 made some meager efforts, but I am still in the unconvinced camp.What drives me NUTS is the inconsistent mousepad. I swear sometimes this thing responds if my finger is just close, and other times I have to slam it into action. Left/right clicks are tightly defined areas, and I may miss the zone and my screen switches to an image I looked at two hours ago, the calendar, search screens or the dreaded tiles with what seems like zero consistency. That, and it also seems to fall asleep- I am used to just barely touching my HP pad to highlight an area, click a button, whatever- and I get nothing. I tap again- no response- I go down to the left corner and physically click the damn thing and now I have a mousepad. The two-finger scroll feature is neat, but OMG, the expand/contract response is completely flaky. First, no response, then I am looking at two words on screen because it's gone to 400%. Try to shrink it down, no response the first time, and then I need a magnifying glass. Is there an adjustment for that? I have tried changing mousepad response, but I find that does not address the inconsistencies.I have noticed, as have others, that wi-fi comes in and out on occasion with no reason I can determine. Fortunately, I usually plug in at the office, but I have lost wireless connectivity from our conference room in the middle of presentations, which is guaranteed to get a response out of me. I also lose connectivity at home- and I have strong signals at both locations. Of course, add to that the frustration of where the hell is networking in Wonderland 8- nothing like troubleshooting under duress.And finally- and this scares me, has happened 4 times (my unit is about 3 months old)- I get this fast multi-color flickering across the display and the unit becomes completely inoperable. It happens when I move locations and I have not shut down, merely closed the screen- and I plug my power supply back in upon opening back up. I believe there may be a static discharge when I first reconnect the power cable that just makes this machine wig out. The solution each time has been a hard shutdown, except for this last time, when it decided to shut itself down after about 20 seconds. (I was trying to get a video of the flickering on my phone so I could show Sony). So far, I restart without issue. Fingers crossed. I now do a static discharge routine whenever I move, which is not a big deal, but I have never had to do this with any laptop before unless I was opening a unit for service. We'll see if that solves it.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't buy this laptop until Sony Fixes it", "Author": "MJaan", "ReviewID": "RFJWKPNPSS9KW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I pretty much never write reviews.
