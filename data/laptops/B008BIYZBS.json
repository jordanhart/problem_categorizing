The only downside I can really think of is the screen touches the keyboard when its closed so when you open it there is small smudges. However, there are screen protectors out there or even little rubber dots that can make that stop when closing.Its pretty much all out there. 16 gigs of ram, i7 quad core, and it came with windows 7. Now compared to my desktop Windows 7 is great for gaming, while running Windows 8 I've run across a few issues. Therefore, Windows 7 is ideal since this is a gaming PC and most products like steam tend to run a little better.I bought the computer mainly so I could take some games with me on deployment and get some college out of the way. One thing I didn't expect but is a great little quirk is that you can customize the colors of nearly every light on the computer. It doesn't affect how it runs, but it is kind of cool.Over all this PC runs like you'd think it runs and behaves as it should and I do recomend it if you can find one for cheap enough as I had. If you don't want to build a desktop or don't know how to(easy but time consuming) this would be a good purchase for the next few years if you want to play higher end games on a computer.", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing computer", "Author": "Giuliana", "ReviewID": "RDWQWLNW6ONFA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The perfect combination between processor and graphic card.
