I've had mine for one week; I discovered the microphone was broken on the second day, and I've been talking with HP's case managers about my options. Looks like I'm going to return it, because there's no fix in the works at HP. And who needs a laptop that you can't use for videoconferencing, Skype, Gmail Videochat, and so on?

This causes the graphics processor to lose electrical connectivity with the mother board.  The unit powers up (lights go on) but the screen stays totally black.  There is a big class action lawsuit in the formative stages regarding this very issue.  When you examine the motherboard from this model (and every other HP laptop since the Compaq/HP merger) one thing is striking...the motherboard thickness is about half that of any Sony VAIO model or Toshiba unit.  HP engineers also elected to use a single heat sink to cool both the GPU and the CPU.  The fix for this endemic HP laptop problem involves either reheating the GPU to readhere the solder to the motherboard or, better, removing the GPU, cleaning up the low grade solder, and resoldering the GPU with a higher grade solder that will not degrade at GPU operating temps.  If the high temps and inadequate heat sinking has caused mother board warpage, you're looking at a new motherboard.  When the computer is reassembled copper shims should be fabricated to place between the GPU, the CPU, and the heat sink.  Use thermal conductive paste also.  There are a number of YouTube videos that go through all this and the fixes in detail.In summary, HP laptops seem to be steadily declining in quality.  This is due to a combination of poor engineering and the use of inadequate quality materials.  A laptop should last at least 5 years.  These current production HP laptops often fail between one and two years.  That is, right after the factory warranty runs out.  Sony and Toshiba don't suffer from these issues near as often as HP, Dell, and even Apple does.  The few dollars HP saves in producing these laptops costs the consumer hundreds down the road.  Cost to fix the above problems ranges from $125 + shipping to $400 plus.  Thus these repairs may not make economical sense.  A new laptop purchase is mandated.  The only vote the consumer has is with his/her wallet.  Until HP fixes this endemic problem, consider purchasing your laptop from a different manufacturer.", "Date": "May 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "How to get around the microphone problem", "Author": "Chaz the SemiGeek", "ReviewID": "R1556E2JYHTQ7V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have this computer, and there is a way around the built in microphone problem.  Use a USB microphone headset.  That's what I do, and it works fine.I've tested the standard microphone port, and it is poor quality like the other reviewers have said.  I recorded my voice with it, and the sound was fuzzy and distorted.  I could make out the words, but the quality was unacceptable, and would drive you crazy if you had to use it all the time.  Shame on HP for that.  That's why I took one star off of review; it should work properly.However, the laptop is thus far, to me, a 5 star laptop in every other way.  And I have found that if I use my Logitech USB headset (which cost about $35.00) to record my own voice, the sound quality is excellent.  I've also used the USB microphone to train the voice recognition feature in Windows 7.  The results were excellent.I don't use Voip or videoconferencing, like the folks who have complained about the built in mic, but if you can use those features with a USB mic, I don't see why it wouldn't work.  Perhaps someone who uses those features could try it out and report back here.I paid $425.00 for the laptop, at Staples about a month ago.  With coupons, I've seen the price lately as low as $400.  At that price, it seems like a good deal, if all else continues to function as it should.  So far I'm happy with it.If your only concern is the mic, but you could live with using a USB mic (which I've read tend to give better results generally), then you may want to consider this model.", "Date": "May 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Stay Away", "Author": "Eugene W.

Nothing works properly and never did. Sometimes it won't start at all, it is overloaded with junk programs you don't want or need. The mouse and buttons are too sensitive. This morning it died. Probably the worst piece of junk I've ever bought in my life. Beginning to think the HP name is garbage.Now I see some recent reviews with similar issues, something is wrong with these laptops, but like the Toyota's, they will probably ignore it, corporate management these days sucks, what happened to standing behind your products?Just got off the phone with HP, the hard drive is dead, they are sending me a new one, but it only lasted 30 days, and the issues others have with it not starting, etc are probably still there....update 3/09/10-- now it has a new hard drive, about 14,000 updates and it will not operate all devices, sometime between last night and today it turned them off, wireless doesn't function, I want to return it and Staples is giving me BS *** DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM STAPLES, they do not stand behind their products, they give a 14 day cover unless you pay about as much as 2 laptops for additional coverage, AND THAT IS LISTED IN FINE PRINT ON THE BACK OF YOUR RECEIPT, THEY DO NOT TELL YOU UP FRONT.I have spent 40+ hours of my personal time trying in good faith to get this junk running, and what do I get from Staples?? lip service.Not to mention tech support for HP is horrible, some are not IT people, they are reading from a guide and it takes hours, I have lost probably 48 hours just dealing with this, oh, and I'm typing this on my old PC, because my brand new HP will not function as it should.It is without a doubt the biggest piece of garbage I have ever bought in my life and I have never had so many problems trying to get assistance with this problem.UPDATE 5/06/11--  It now blew its mother board after a year of so so performance, slow starts, re starts, shutting off for no reason, etc etc, put HP motherboard problems in your search, there is supposed to be a class action suit going, I was told HP knew they had motherboard issues, I will never buy another HP product and urge you not to, as a nation, we must be wiser consumers ( like never buying from BP again).

It has one HUGE and fatal flaw: the built-in microphone is EXTREMELY bad. If you are absolutely sure you will never want to use this laptop for anything involving the microphone (like video chat) then you will probably be happy with this purchase. But if there is a sliver of a chance you'll want to use the microphone at some point, then AVOID, AVOID AVOID.I was happy with this model the first few days I had it. I liked the look, the feel, and the fast response. It really suited my basic needs.  Then I tried to Skype (live video chat) with family members. They could barely hear me and could not understand what I was saying due to the excessive backround noise, inceassant audio drop-out, and fluctuating levels in my microphone. It was horrible. I had to write what I wanted to say on Skype; this microphone is literally unusable.I spent a long time trying to readjust the microphone settings but nothing helped. I tried an external mic and it was just as bad.I took the laptop in to the place where I purchased it to see if their tech staff could help. A day later the tech called me with bad news. There was nothing he could to to fix this mic. He also said he tested two other G60-630us units in the store and found the same exact problem. He tested two additional HP models in the \"G\" line, and found the microphone problem in those models, too.His conclusion: Likely ALL the HP \"G\" models have this horrible built-in microphone problem and there's not a way to fix it.He did test some other HP models besides those in the \"G\" series. He reports microphones in the HP \"D\" series (like the DV6-2150us, which, unlike the G60-630us, uses a digital microphone) worked just fine. I tested the microphone on the \"D\" unit display model and was pleased with the result. I will likely buy that \"D\" line model as my replacement for this \"G\" model.In conclusion: AVOID, AVOID, AVOID the HP G60-630us and it's ultra-horrible built-in microphone. To be safe, avoid buying any HP with a \"G\" in the model number unless you test the microphone first.", "Date": "March 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Defective.

Although I purchased mine from Staples because it was on sale this week, I would recommend shopping through Amazon any time. As for the laptop, he is sleek, has a number keypad, set up was a breeze, basically you plug it in and it did everything else for you.  I did purchase the logitech MK300 wireless keyboard and mouse just because I will never get used to typing extensive documents on a laptop keyboard, (I'm a little old school).  But even getting the laptop to recognize the accessories such as wireless keyboard, mouse, printer and magic jack was as I said plug it in and they were all ready to go!  It comes with the Norton 360 60 day trial, but PLEASE if you get no other accessories....puchase Norton 360 anti-virus for when your trial is expired.The only con I can see about the laptop is that the color resolution on the screen is not as bright and vivid as some of the other laptops I viewed in the store during the purchase, but they all carried a price ticket of $900 or more so..... if you are on a budget and looking for a great laptop that is high quality and reasonably priced, I really don't think you would be sorry by purchasing this one.

The external design of the laptop is very nice and simple and as of then, my only issue was the internal microphone (as noted in other reviews). The microphone's audio quality is extremely poor, too poor to make use of. I purchased a microphone on Amazon for under $3, and it worked fantastically (click here for a link to the microphone). Simply plug it into the microphone jack in front of the laptop. The touch pad is great, it's sometimes hard to navigate with though if it's extremely dry as the material doesn't seem to be very glossy. It's a little odd that the pad is indented so much, you get used to it very fast, though. The multiple USB ports are convenient. Something also very convenient is the button (right next to the power button) that disconnects and connects you to the internet. There is also a little button above the touch pad that disables and enables the touch pad.My main concern with this laptop was, after around a year of usage, the top left screw on the bottom came loose and fell out. I had no idea this had happened. I did notice some trouble plugging it in to get charged, some turbulence opening and closing the lid, and more majorly the monitor's picture: everything that was supposed to be black was green. This was very irritating so I began to use it less. At that time, this laptop became my secondary laptop so I didn't really look into getting it fixed. I began to use it a little more often and after time, the bottom left cracked, separating it from the top and exposing the inside. After a while, the picture got worse and worse until eventually, it went black entirely. After doing some searching on the internet about my problem, I came to the conclusion that the screw coming loose eventually caused the monitor to get disconnected inside. I knew someone else who had this same laptop and after a while, his laptop's picture worsened and eventually, the back came off and it cracked in various places. His picture quality did not resemble mine, his may have been due to exposure to moisture after the seal was broken as a result of the screw coming loose.Good warning signs to look out for are (as I stated above) minor or major turbulence opening and closing your laptop's lid, depreciation in picture quality, and when plugging in your laptop, it feels as if it's loosened inside. If you realize the screw's come loose on yours, simply take it to be repaired or you could fix the screw yourself (that size of screw is a little tricky to find).One more problem is the charger that comes with the laptop. The part where it gets plugged into the laptop breaks off too easily inside the cord. I had to replace it twice, trying out different chargers from Amazon as HP would only allow me to replace the cord for free under warranty once and the price for the cord from HP is ridiculously high. Many of the cords on Amazon are very cheap and don't work. However, the one I'm using now I've had for months and it works great, perhaps even better quality than HP's, besides a little interference now and then with my TV.Overall, the laptop is a great deal, reliable, and very enjoyable, just note the microphone problems and watch out for the screw and the charger.", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "HP G60", "Author": "S.
