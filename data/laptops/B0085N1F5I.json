Worth for the price.Con's - doesn't have a CD drive,but that's the reason it's light weight, the speakers are not all that great, keyboard isn't with a back light.If you want a light weight laptop then this is a good product if the cons don't matter much to you.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great laptop!", "Author": "A. Morales", "ReviewID": "R1VQPKO0H6638", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use this for work several hours a day and it runs great! This is my second Toshiba. I was satisifed with the first one so I thought I should stick to the same brand. I've purchased nothing but big and bulky laptops in the past. I have to lug around my laptop for work all the time. I decided this time to purchase something smaller and lighter. I love how thin the ultrabook is. The screen is a decent size. There's no CD drive in this one, but I just bought an external one. I rarely use it anyway, so that's not an issue for me. Highly recommended!", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "good", "Author": "Ivan", "ReviewID": "R6YUCZN2GLE30", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Es una portatil muy delgada, justo como decia la publicidad.Tiene un estilo muy bonito y muy ligera.I recommend it", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great little computer", "Author": "Aaron T.

Despite very light usage, the computer keyboard failed within 4 four months of the purchase. Among the alpha keys only four or five keys works.

Link", "ReviewID": "R2WRD3V75WV1HH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the first Toshiba laptop I've ever purchased that completely disappointed me. I bought this computer for my husband to use for travel presentations. It freezes frequently, charges slowly, and has a very short battery life. The worst design feature, however, is its complete lack of a VGA or DVI port. This means that hooking this laptop up to a projector is a logistical nightmare. A technician, who had managed his computer supply store for 15 years, said that he had never seen a laptop without at least one of these types of ports. I researched laptops pretty thoroughly -- I thought -- but admit I didn't specifically look to see whether it had a DVI or VGA port since laptops do typically have at least one of them. Now we're stuck with this lemon of a computer and will have to buy another computer. I can't recommend this to anyone since it freezes up for frequently and shuts down some programs (Outlook, for example). Do not buy!", "Date": "January 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awful", "Author": "iloveosoul", "ReviewID": "RJDPTM88WUZE5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The Toshiba arrived quickly and died quickly. I turned it on and began charging the battery. When I went to use it it completely froze and would not shut down. It made an incredibly annoying high pitched buzzing sound too. I followed all the shut down options, checked the internet on my desktop for solution, but I could not get it to stop buzzing or unfreeze. I ended up putting it in a room on the other side of the house until the battery died. Thankfully Amazon took it back and gave me a full refund.", "Date": "January 17, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0085N1F5I"}}
