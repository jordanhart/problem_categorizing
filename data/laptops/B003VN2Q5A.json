I love Dell and have had plenty of great Latitude laptops, but this is not one of them.  Consider instead the E6520, which is the dramatically improved newer version of the machine on this page, or the HP Elitebook 8560p.  Both the E6520 and Elitebook 8560p are far better designs than this one.  Look at the keyboard, fake speakers, port layout, battery life, among other things, and you will see what I mean for yourself.", "Date": "October 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "a great purchase", "Author": "hazem", "ReviewID": "R2VD5MO41C7MQ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this comp few months ago, and it just fits my needs,it is hard working machine, No noise, no heat,very strong WiFi signal even in distant areas.I recommend it to anybody seeking hard work, who doesn't care too much about the design.", "Date": "June 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "high performance high pc", "Author": "Luisa", "ReviewID": "R3OQVNJSYQRQ1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "i have had the computer for more than a year, running windows7. what i love most about this computer is that i can keep the charger plugged in over night and it automatically knows when the battery is full, the performance is good as well, virtual machines run fast on it, it comes with a good sized hard drive, the video card its nice, which lets you play pc games suited for ps3, the battery is pretty decent, i think this is the longest lasting pc battery that i have used. and you can never go wrong with a dell. every dell computer that i have had especially home pcs has performed great. the screen is nice and big, and im always wathing movies on this machine. it is worth the buy. this one being sold is an i7, i have an i5 and mines runs fast.", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "My new favorite toy.", "Author": "Glen A Evans", "ReviewID": "R1I45N7FWIPRF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best purchase I've made so far.

After six months of use, two of the USB ports stopped working. The technology team at my company replaced the motherboard which resolved this issue. However, two months later, the computer now freezes when I move the Dell even slightly, and then I need to force a shutdown in order to restart and unfreeze the computer. Also, the power cord now has a short, and I need to play with the cord until I get the blue light to indicate 'charging'. I then need to be very careful that the cord doesn't move and short out again; this in addition to, as I mentioned, needing to be  careful that the computer doesn't move on my desk and freeze thus causing me to lose whatever information I just entered into the computer. I am currently awaiting the technology team at my company to pick up this computer to check on the freezing issue and replace the power cord. For a laptop at this price point, I would recommend taking a look at the Toshiba Portege or Lenovo IdeaPad. The Dell Inspiration also receives good reviews, but I would not recommend any Dell product after my experience with this product.", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003VN2Q5A"}}
