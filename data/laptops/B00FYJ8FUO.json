{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Outstanding laptop that few people know about !!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "CEC", "ReviewID": "R2FPO8RVAPCY1X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Was looking for a light fast laptop with good graphics card to run a workstation program on it and needed at least a 2gb graphics card and i7 cpu with a SSD for OS and hard drive to save large files. I was getting tired of lugging around an old ASUS G55 8 lb gaming laptop and this new gigabyte U24F is fantastic, only 3 lbs and more powerful graphics card. It is well built, good quality. It is comparable to a MacBook air pro etc.. that cost $2500.... I am not a MAC fan.  You can't go wrong with this laptop. I didn't need the capabilities of the next gigabyte higher version of this the P34G with slightly better card and screen because I am not using it much for gaming and battery life was important (P34G was listed at about 4-5 hours).  The U24F has great battery life.. don't know how long if I was gaming on it all day but for normal use, web etc.. its is at least 7hrs and siting all day off and on its 9-10 hours.  I am totally satisfied with this laptop.. and I have had many!! You can't go wrong....", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Problem after problem...", "Author": "Kevin P.

Who wants to pay this much for a computer that just doesn't function smoothly.  I basically called gigabyte customer support and finally got someone intelligent and I asked him if they have a lotta problems like mine etc etc and he was like some yah and I was like do you have a gigabyte and he was like... um... no.  And I was like why?  And he said with his discount which was good he said but not huge, it wasn't worth it.  So if the guy who works there is getting 30% off and its not worth it how are we supposed to buy it?Problems with the laptop:WiFi range is short, it also cuts off randomly and you have to restart until it works again.  Perfect.The touchpad is amateur hour.Randomly will start making weird noises and shutdown.Doesn't come with windows 8.1, just windows 8 which is even worse.  Once I ugraded some of my problems were fixed but I had to reinstall the bios and everything else and it took about 4 hours which is a project you shouldn't have to undertake when paying over a grand for a laptop.It does have a good battery life and when my FPS aren't dropping to 6 for no reason (playing LoL with medium graphics and nothing else running) its okay with games.  Screen is okay but they could have easily fit a 15 inch screen in its place by having less plastic on the outside casing.  Its just all these little things that bother me.  The audio is loud but the quality isn't good.  When I use the HDMI sometimes the audio works sometimes it doesn't.  Just depends how the laptop is feeling that day I guess.  And I know how to change the audio selection but making the hdmi the default doesn't work.I wouldn't buy this.  I am returning mine.", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Intel Intel Core i7 4500U 3.0 GHz\n8 GB DDR3\n500 GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive, 128 GB Solid-State Drive\n14-Inch Screen\nWindows 8 Professional", "Name": "Gigabyte U24F-CF1 14-Inch Laptop", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41KiiP3w9oL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00FYJ8FUO"}}
