I really wish I had opted for the 480gb SSD instead of 240 as I find myself playing more games than I thought I would. It's been perfect for running my ArcGIS and other GIS softwares and handles rendering of raster images well (for those in the geospatial field who are looking, like I was, for a laptop that performs like a desktop for GIS processing and analytical work on the go).Once I got used to it (about 2 weeks), I love windows 8.1. The only issue was the fingerprint reader as it appears that the software and drivers needed for it to work properly are not yet compatible with windows 8.1.All in all, great PC and great work by Eluktronics who customized this PC.", "Date": "February 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great tech specs, poor fit and finish", "Author": "White Oaks", "ReviewID": "R1902MNSW3CFAU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The positives:  Lightning fast, huge bright screen, Almost 1TB of SSD storage and a built in back up HDD for onboard full backups.  Tech specs like these will run you about 1000 dollars more in a high end laptop (specifically the SSD/HDD config).The negatives:  The touchpad is a horror show.... no clear buttons to click, difficult to understand where to tap and how hard to hit it.  Does anyone do usability testing at HP, or are they just trying to make it look sleek?  The Leap motion is less than useless, no integration or presence (no you aren't going to go all Minority Report with it).  Keyboard is extremely flimsy, but functional so far.  Network cable only plugs in with an awkward spring loaded door latch.  And, coming from an Elitebook where I had bought 3 power adapters for convenience, HP has gone with yet another power connector plug form factor, rendering my other adapters obsolete.  They should be more respectful of their customer's time and money and just use one plug format for all... extremely simple concept.In all, one of the better raw performance machines for the price, but if you can afford it, go with a custom box that doesn't have these oddball hardware inconsistencies.", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GLO2188"}}
