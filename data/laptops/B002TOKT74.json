I saw no reason to spend $500 plus dollars for minimal needs that i require...So here a vote for refurbished.

I am 82 and an ex Men's Clothing Store Mgr., Shoe Store Mgr. and Buyer with over 25 years in Sales.  I have since returned the Lap Top after 2 weeks use and found several problems with it.  I sent a letter to Mr. Jeff Bezos CEO of Amazon as well as Zedekiah Nyanchama explaining my dissatisfaction with it and asked for a full refund. My purchase price of $117.14 w/ shipping & handling plus my return UPS charges of $37.42 and was credited with only the $117.14.  I wrote to both Amazon and seller explaining the fact that the LT had operational problems, battery that couldn't hold a charge and was badly scratched with a loose cover that was not steady because of a rubber pad on the bottom. The seller replied back that a tech had checked it out and did not find any problems. Well i found them, and expected a full refund with the UPS return charges because the product was not properly or truly represented in the ad. The picture above does not represent the product shipped to me.  There was no disc as shown.  Only a badly worn Lap Top w/ power cord and box attachment.I also stated how disappointed with the Customer Care Service from the seller and did not understand why Amazon did not back the product as advertised. This was my first experience with Amazon Marketplace and because i was not afforded a full and complete refund for purchase and return charges as yet.  I will not purchase any more Merchandise from Amazon.  I thought my letter to Mr. Bezos would have prompted Amazon to ask the seller to reimburse me for the return of a faulty and operational problems that did not meet the Advertised Explanation.Sincerely Yours,Charles Redfoot", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "wonderful laptop (latitude d610)", "Author": "shon j", "ReviewID": "R17DZQQ47N6MDV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "using it right now. have had it for a week. has EVERYTHING i needed and works wonderfullyhave yet to encounter any problems with it", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Trash", "Author": "T.

She is so happy with it, and it even seems faster than any laptop she had previously used. (Even her sisters  $1500.00 one she had used this summer.)

Once it was turned on and used we immediately realized that the shift key didn't work, but we figured no big deal.  Then we realized that the battery didn't hold a charge.  The second you unplugged the laptop it turned off.  Not what was indicated in the sales description.  Next we realized that the laptop had been riddled with pop-ups (even when just going to Netflix), that had been downloaded by the previous owner, and our son couldn't even get on the thing without fighting with the browser.  Then, we noticed that the cord to the power supply was frayed, and a shock hazard for our son.  Lastly, after about a week and a half of my son struggling with this piece of crap, the power cord stopped working all together and now there is no possible way to turn the laptop on without buying an entirely new cord.  Worst, the seller won't even respond to our request for a return.
