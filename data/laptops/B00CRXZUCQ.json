Patterson", "ReviewID": "R2CI4JF6VY040W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Make no mistake, Lenovo produces a solid fully featured highly-ranked laptop for... peanuts.The G500, with an Intel Core i3-Ivy Bridge dual-core 2.5 GHz processor, 500GB HD, 2 - 3.0 USB ports, 4 GB of DDR3 RAM, with Win 8 as native OS, and more, the G500 matches anything in the 2013 game up to twice the cost. I did kick my RAM up to 8GB since I use Adobe Photoshop CS6.This G500 will get 'r done! You can pay a bit more for the i5 processor model but you will not gain much/enough.I have had computers since 1990 and Windows from 3.1 (with a few Big Mac's along the way) and I am here to promise that if you give Win 8 64-bit a chance, you WILL fall in love with it. I did. No manual. Look Ma, no hands. Just toured and learned. Quickly. I predict that if you liked Win 7 you will really take to 8. Really. And moving into Win 8 and setting my network, adding devices, etc., it was a SNAP! Even more effortless than in Win 7.Lenovo support is excellent, both online and through telephone contact.The only drawback, for some, might be the weight, generally slightly heavier compared to most lappers. This is due to overbuild and should NOT be considered a minus.The design is exceptional, contemporary, and stylish sort of... in a Chinese way. Lenovo has been around for many years (began with IBM) and you'd be surprised at how much Lenovo there is today in other brand computers.I could go on and on heaping praise on Lenovo and this G500 but I will bet that IF you do your research and compare, you'll grab this or another Lenovo model pronto.Now go do your homework.And to the nitpickers, yes, this is a late 2012 model.Not to worry.UPDATE 11.11.2013Still liking this lapper VERY MUCH. And slowly getting used to the Win 8 first big service pack I (or 8.1)installed a few weeks ago. Norton AV 360 had a brief conflict but they provided a patch that cured a short-lived evil; no other problems so far and none anticipated. Everyone I talk to about Lenovo and their product line, from rank beginner to experienced expert, agrees that Lenovo's recent number two ranking in the cluttered world of laptops IS well deserved.A shout out to all you past, present, and future vets; THANKS for your service.UPDATE  11.30.2013This economy laptop continues to please, amaze, and run fast and smooth just like the big expensive guys.Win 8.1 still a winner in my experience.I pinch myself when I look back in disbelief and realize I have no more than 300 dollars invested. Like the old Timex, my G500 keeps on ticking and also like the Timex, if it fails, I can toss it.Happy Holidays.", "Date": "October 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good everyday working machine", "Author": "mfks", "ReviewID": "R11GB8FGLDFMPA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:  good overall package in affordable price, solid sturdy machine, windows 8 easy to use, fast processor, handy keyboard, good battery life, excellent surround sound system, good screen resolution.....many more!!!Cons: so far none!After extensive searching for a good affordable laptop, I bought this laptop from amazon. They delivered it within a day time as I requested. I was very anxious about using Windows 8 because I read soooo many bad reviews about it.......like they almost convinced me that it would be a big flop.....BUT WAIT!!! I have found Windows 8 very interesting and more attractive to work on. It took me only 15 minutes to learn how to use it.........I mean it's easy to use, just with new ideas. And I took a gamble choosing this laptop without a touch screen......but now that I am working on it, I don't think I need a touch screen laptop to use Windows 8. Also, this laptop has awesome speakers and you would enjoy them!!! Then this key board is soft enough to make you feel as if you are playing on scrabble game. The hardware also looks sturdy and reliable. There is a new recovery button present here. The battery is long lasting and would work easily for about 4 hours or so.

Hirst", "ReviewID": "RF6H4XZ4AL5RZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop from MicroCenter when it was on sale for $450. For an i5 laptop with 4GB of RAM and a 500GB Hard Drive, this seemed like a steal. Now I'm pretty sure I'm the one who was robbed.Less than two months after purchasing this laptop, the top-left part of the keyboard stopped working. I called Lenovo Support which is horrendous (at least when it comes to consumer-grade IDEA products). They said I'd have to send in my laptop with 7 business day turnaround AND pay for shipping (I'd add an exclamation point but I currently can't)I begged them for a CRU (customer replaceable part) because I worked in IT for 5 years and have plenty of experience replacing laptop keyboards, but they wouldn't budge.I really can't afford to be without my laptop for 7 days since I'm a web designer and rely on this to pay my bills. I'm hoping I can just buy a replacement keyboard on eBay or Amazon, but so far, I'm out of luck.Let's put this in perspective...Before this laptop, I had a Toshiba laptop that lasted me 5 years. Now this laptop has lasted me less than two months. In 5 years of IT experience, I have never heard of a laptop that has a dead keyboard after a month and a half of use.If the keyboard dies in less than two months, I can only imagine how long the video card, display, and motherboard are going to last.Don't waste your money on this laptop.

Park", "ReviewID": "R10E02C6NPRYLK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a prefect entry-level laptop, good for video Skype chat, etc.A couple caveat: (1) this configuration does not include a Bluetooth chip (you can buy a cheap USB adapter for a couple dollars elsewhere); I thought that was a bit odd, but not too serious; (2) mind which wireless driver you are using---if you are using wrong combination of Windows OS (8.0 vs. 8.1) and Lenovo-provided wireless drivers, the wireless will not work well with some WAPs (but there *is* a right combination; you can Google for \"G500 wireless issues\" for solution).My favorite thing about this laptop was how much I could disassemble it---one day I spilled a cup of milk on the keyboard by mistake; I think the laptop shut itself down (and I unplugged the power and battery as soon as I realized what I had done). Following the service manual from Lenovo, I could disassemble *everything* in this laptop, right down to the motherboard---after cleaning up the motherboard and other parts with rubbing alcohol (if you ever spill liquid on your laptop, this is absolute necessity; even if you don't see too much liquid leaking out, due to capillary action between circuit board and plastic film on it, you can be sure that enough liquid will have gotten to your motherboard), I put it back together, and the laptop still works as if nothing happened to it.

This is a well known motherboard problem for this model of Asus and wasn't worth fixing--which would require a motherboard replacement  Lenovo has scored pretty well lately in reliability so I thought I would try one.The Lenovo G500 is about the same as my Asus u5e in it's size and heft.  It's a little big to carry around but just fine for using around the house, occasionally moving it from table to couch, etc.  Keyboard is good for typing.  Nice large screen.  The biggest downside for me was that it came with Windows8.  Since I didn't have any interest in investing time in learning a new interface, I downloaded a copy of Classic Shell (use your search engine to find it), which does a great job of making Win8 look like Win7.  It's well worth a $5 donation.  Problem solved.Oh, by the way, don't throw out the battery with the packing.  It's packed separately and I wondered why I was getting the message that the battery could not be discovered.  It was only when I called Lenovo support (excellent support by the way, that I found out that the computer doesn't come with battery installed.

Melcher \"Mommy & Professional Christian Ed...", "ReviewID": "R1TM6HL4Z81M7G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have the touch version of this laptop.  Well, I own it but I don't actually have it because I sent it to Lenovo about 2 weeks ago for repairs.  First problem, it is built very cheaply.  The two parts on the bottom keep clicking apart when I pick it up to put it on a table or my lap.  I didn't notice that it had clicked apart and tried plugging in the charger but the charger end pushed the port into the computer because the side was clicked apart.  It had clicked apart probably half a dozen times before this and the ports inside would get twisted but I'd always been able to get it clicked together again.  Second problem, the keys and mouse pad are all very flat (not raised like previous computers I've had)  So, I have to  keep looking which of the two mouse buttons my hand is on because I can't feel where I am without looking.  A third problem I had may be more a Windows 8 problem or a problem with having a touch screen than a problem with this actual piece of equipment.  The cursor wanders off when I'm typing so that it will randomly delete sections of what I've typed.  Part of the issue is that there are some new keys on the keyboard that weren't on previous keyboards and if your hand accidentally bumps one of them the computer may close a window or switch to the desktop when you didn't mean to.  I was relying on this computer for work so I have had to manage sharing my husband's work computer while they figure out what they are doing.  The customer service from Lenovo has been a bad experience for me too.  I told them exactly what was wrong when I first called about the problem.  They said to send it in to them but I had to pay the shipping to get it there.  Then after about two weeks, I get an email that the issue isn't covered under warranty and I need to send $187 to have it fixed.  I told them exactly what was wrong when I called in.  It feels a lot like a scam for them to not tell me at that point that it is not covered but then demand money when they have my computer hostage.  I could have had it fixed locally and gotten it back in a few days.  Thankfully, I purchased extra warranty protection through Square Trade and they have told me they will pay the shipping and repair fees Lenovo is charging.  But, I will still be without my computer for 3 to 4 weeks.

I can't believe I did it myself. Here is the path I took to fix the \"flyaway\" mouse:Go to CONTROL PANEL----EASE OF ACCESS----EASE OF ACCESS CENTER----MAKE THE MOUSE EASIER TO USE----MOUSE PROPERTIES----ELAN.  Within the ELAN tab there are different options. I turned off the \"tap\" option for the mouse. It fixed everything. My mouse cursor stays put like it should now. I have changed my rating of this computer to 5 stars now that I can use it again. I really do like this computer, and because of needing to go explore how to fix the mouse cursor problem, I've even learned my way around Win8, and it's not that bad. Give it a try.I'm going keep updating this review as I use my computer for a longer period of time. This is my initial review. First, this machine seems super-fast to me. I've never had an i3 processor before, so I notice a huge improvement in processing speed. If you've had only Pentium or lower grade processors, you will love this system. In fact, don't buy anything lower than an i3, because life and technology and the internet move fast, and I think this system will hold it's own for a while. I love the keys for typing. They are some sort of special touch keys. They look the same to me, but I really do like the tension and bounce-back of these keys. It boots much faster than my old Pentium, and shut down is even faster. So all of that is good.Here is what I don't like: The mouse, the mouse, the mouse!! It has taken me about 3 times longer than necessary to type this out because this mouse seems to have a mind and a will of its own. It seems to randomly \"click\" on things all by itself. I am making sure my hands are NOT touching the mouse area when typing (which is rather difficult to do), and it still happens! Grrrr!! In spite of all that I love about this computer, I am actually considering returning it because of this stupid mouse! I have looked all over on the internet to see if there is something I can do to fix this, but so far no luck. If any of you have any ideas, please let me know.A note about windows 8:  If you have been using Win95, 98, 2000, XP, Vista or even 7 be prepared to have your world turned upside down. This new system is.....completely different. As in completely different. There is definitely a learning curve. I've watched some YouTube videos about Windows8, and am beginning to get the hang of it. My first thought was that there was no way I could learn this system, but I was wrong. It is possible to teach this old dog some new tricks. Does that mean I love Win8 yet? Um....no. But I will in time. I am not considering Win8 as part of this computer, because it's an operating system. That has nothing to do with the quality or lack thereof of a computer.Final note, I am definitely going to contact Amazon about returning this computer due to the crazy mouse problems. It has taken me 35 minutes to type this review because I have to keep stopping and moving my curser back to where it belongs, as well as delete the misplaced typing I did before I realized the mouse had moved. Unless Lenovo fixes this problem, I cannot in good conscience recommend this computer to anyone. I had originally given it a 3 star rating and I will now be downgrading it to one star. Yes, I could buy a wireless mouse to \"fix\" it. But I bought a laptop so I could have everything in one place. Good luck to you if y***UPDATE***If it looks like my review got cut off, that's because the mouse problem acted up and apparently landed on the \"enter\" button and my review got submitted prematurely. I think it made my point for me.
