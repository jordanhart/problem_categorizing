I love the SSD, my first.  Very smooth, fast.  It is upgraded from what was described.  It has windows 8.1 instead of 8 and best of all, it has a 2gb GeForce 860m instead of the 765.  It's Christmas time!  What a present from computer upgrade king.  Nice work, excellent laptop.  I work on Server 2012 on my old laptop, but am willing to give windows 8.1 a try.I'm going to upgrade it to Enterprise through my msdn subscription though, need to join my domain.Anyway, kick butt laptop.  great keyboard feel, everything better than expected.  I'm loving this!", "Date": "May 21, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00FJ3ZFMG"}}
