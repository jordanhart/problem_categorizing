I had connected to the internet before calling Dell which has step by step instructions when you open the laptop. I wanted a different browser and home page, connect my printer, and while the laptop comes with a free month of security software I have the same software which is good for 3 devices and Dell support straitened that out for me.", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this Computer!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R231A9H0IDSKMU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although the computer is heavy to carry, I love the large screen and everything comes in so quickly.  This computer has windows 8,so I had to learn it as opposed to windows 7.  However, I have adjusted and am enjoying it immensely.  I wanted an entertainment computer, and this computer definitely fits the bill.  I can watch old tv shows and new movies and am enjoying them equally.  I would recommend this computer to anyone who wanted an entertainment computer.", "Date": "October 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dell Computer is Worst Ever", "Author": "Linda J Heibel Pridgen", "ReviewID": "R1LDTTQNITUPUX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Nothing but problems since receiving this Dell Inspiron. I wanted the bigger screen but the quality is missing. Hard drive arrived broken. The machine knocked like a hammer upon turning it on. Call to Dell Customer Service went well and they sent a technician out to repair it within days. He installed a new hard drive sent from Dell.  We were so happy with the replacement, but he left before it was installed completely. Now the new hard drive works. But this one sounds like a washing machine whirring around inside it is so loud. We are very disappointed!! I just can't believe that Dell products are this bad. Get me out of this. Dell, prove me wrong about your products.", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Value for What You Get However Speakers are Crap", "Author": "Kevin T. Matthews", "ReviewID": "R13KYAN7GNE1PO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great price for what you are getting. The computer is fast and the screen resolution is very good. It does just as good as some of the $1000.00 machines I was looking at out there. The only thing I wish I had gotten was a backlit keyboard. That would have come in handy when I lay in bed at night and SERF the web. It was easy to connect to my home wireless system. I love this big screen. Once you go 17.3\" you never go back to the smaller screen. I gave it 4 stars because the speakers sound like they are playing out of a tin can. You would have to spend days looking to find a worse sounding set of speakers to the point I am convinced Dell had to go to great strides to make these sound terrible. I would bet the speakers are late 1940's technology.  Dell would have been better off leaving the speakers out of this model. This computer could be the poster child for poor quality sound. I feel like in the ad they need to put a warning in big bold red letters stating that they are still working out the bugs in the 1940 technology speakers so the consumer could get some idea of just how poor the sound quality is..", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Laptop", "Author": "Principalkathy \"Principalkathy\"", "ReviewID": "R2IQ97Z39BRGZ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this laptop to replace my desktop computer.

The only problem I had was that after I charged the computer on another Dell charger (same specifications as mine) and switched back to my charger the battery said it could not determine the power of the adapter and would not charge. Dell customer service did a good job looking into it, found it was covered under the warranty, but said that the charger that came with my computer was a fake (Amazon thankfully reimbursed me for that). So that's why the computer got confused once it saw the real thing. My advice is don't even think of plugging this or any Dell laptop into a different charger, even if you think it's the same.Overall, this is an excellent computer for anyone who wants a big laptop mostly for desk use. I searched around a bit and this is as good as it gets for $520. The processor and memories are great for the price, and Dell's customer support does a great job if you ever need their help.", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "10/10", "Author": "Nicolas", "ReviewID": "R115I5VZM3LDND", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The only thing that i dont like about this laptop is that it comes with windows 8, but overall is a great product.

Unfortunately, I encountered malware while installing Adobe Acrobat Reader which made the machine more unstable. Performed a system reset (OS reinstallation) with Dell's guidance and the machine is much better now.  Biggest complaint is the touchpad that I seem to be continually bumping with my palms causing the mouse to move or even jump to a different window.  Reinstalled the touchpad driver and it is now somewhat less sensitive. I also prefer the older format screen which gave you more vertical space.  The font must be kept small to see a worthwhile amount of data. Screen itself is sharp and clear. So far, the machine has adequate cpu, memory and speed for what i need to do. Windows 8 is a learning curve but at this point my biggest complaint is all the extra junk they preinstall on the machine.

I am very pleased with this investment. It runs very well. Windows 8 was a little tricky to get used to, but now that I have used it for a while, I actually like it a lot. I have been using this computer for about 2 months, and I have had no issues. Similar Dell models reported having a noisy fan, this does not have a noisy fan. Only two minor complaints: The matte finish does show finger prints like crazy. I got used to it, but initially it looked like all I did was eat potato chips and work on my computer. My only other complaint is that where my wrists lay against the edge of the computer, it is just a little sharp. I put small pieces of masking tape over the edge, but I think I can take care of the issue with just a small file. I am very pleased with this computer, and this purchase all together.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Easy to use", "Author": "Jo Anne Born", "ReviewID": "R1YDUB2TFECQNB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This computer is easy to use and light enough to have on my lap rather then sitting at a desk.
