I stays cool. Which is great and does not have a loud cooling system.  The weight is okay but could be lighter in weight. I like the sleekness and the color.  Windows 8 is okay.  Windows 8 is tricky but okay.  Windows 8 does not have a DVD maker which is a true pain if you are a person that has that need. Over all would definitely recommend this computer.", "Date": "May 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop  SSD even better!!", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R2MDIUSVVPK5YX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop for my son and we both decided against windows 8 as an OS. We had a really tough time installing Windows 7 and there is not much help from ASUS on the configuration to use in the UEFI (new bios). We found that disabling most of the secure boot features and not booting from a UEFI device seemed to work. I runs really fast and has a really good battery life and a neat sleep mode widget from ASUS.  We then installed a 256GB SSD drive and this thing is like lightening!!!  I would consider this a great unit but we did find it for $40 less after we made the purchase, so shop around !", "Date": "April 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Keri L.

It's quick and a great computer! Has a lot if nice features like the cool rest by the keyboard for your hands. Love how the charger clips in too! It's not flimsy like a lot of computers.

It has been right. I love my Asus, and I love the way it works. The windows 8 is different as far as navigation, but I like it. The computer works wonderfully. More than enough power to hold my programs. I use power point, word, excel, photoshop, and AutoCAD and this computer doesn't miss a beat! I still can upload or download items in a reasonable amount of time with no problem. The color and design is nice too. I get a lot of compliments on it. If you're questioning, don't. It's worth it.

The laptop doesn't head up too much, either. It is all around pretty good.For school, it performs pretty well, but I will say the keyboard is just average. It doesn't feel as nice as all the other laptops you will mess with, but like I said earlier... the power to price ratio is amazing.If the keyboard felt a little stronger and had better feedback, I would give this laptop 5 stars.I have had no problems with this laptop and do not regret purchasing it for a second.", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's okay", "Author": "Don Boudreau \"road dog\"", "ReviewID": "R7U3CAW99WSGW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "No real problems here.  Not a big fan of Windows 8.  Wished I had watched for other options like firewire ports and PCI express card slots.  Can't complain though; fair price and its working well.

Reynolds \"Excel Expert\"", "ReviewID": "R3FZMQTUKTAQYN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The only thing I don't like about this laptop is the keyboard is a little unpredictable. I went ahead and got a Logitech bluetooth keyboard to use for this laptop if I have to do a lot of accurate typing (whether a Word document, or and Excel spreadsheet). There are some keys on the keyboard that don't take. I don't know whether you have to break the keyboard in like a pair of shoes, but to be safe, the bluetooth keyboard does come in handy.", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Mary Ann Farley \"maffetina\"", "ReviewID": "R3U9Z1LXG9QPTX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using the K55A for a solid nine months or so, and it's an outstanding computer. I use Norton Antivirus and Crashplan as backup, and it's been smooth sailing all year (knock wood! :)).The only glitchy thing I experience is sometimes the touchpad gets overly sensitive, which will make the cursor jump around on the screen, and I've no idea why this happens. It's a problem that comes and goes, but considering how robust the features are in this model, I'm not going to dock it a star.The cover on the unit is perhaps a little softer than I would like, but again, what you pay for with ASUS are the features. As I use this laptop really as a desktop, this hasn't been a big deal either. I'm considering the ASUS T-100 notebook as a portable option to take around with me, although I've taken the ASUS K55A on trips and it's been fine. It's simply a little heavier than I would like, but that's what you get with such a feature-rich machine!One feature I LOVE is that this thing never gets hot! My old laptop got so hot on the bottom that I had to buy a special cushion for it. I always had the fear that it was going to explode in my lap! But the ASUS remains cool no matter how long I have it on.I've been reading lately that ASUS's customer service has been slipping, but I wouldn't know as I haven't needed it with this fantastic model.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Black screen all the time; cursor jumps around", "Author": "Rebecca Richmeier", "ReviewID": "R1PACYEK7FMJX5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I rarely write reviews but this laptop as been a huge disappointment. My main problem is that the screen blacks out. Moving the mouse and attempting to restart the laptop don't work. I have to remove the battery for a few minutes and then restart. It's very inconvenient when you're using it for recipes online and you can't proceed because you're waiting on the battery and restart. I have to do this at least once a week. I also find it weird that the cursor jumps around. I'll be typing and all of the sudden the cursor has moved to another location in the text.

The hardware works with most distributions right out of the box. The CPU is fast and the HDD is large enough (750gigs).

Start up is really fast, and waking it up is only delayed by putting in my password.  Functions very well.  I miss the Paint Shop Pro that came with my Dell, but I think that's because I didn't want to spend the money for it.  The speakers seem to be on the bottom of the machine, so if it's on your lap or any not-hard, flat surface, it's hard to hear.

Had a few hiccups early on with random resets and shut-downs. Was going to send it back to ASUS under my warranty since I've had it for less than a week and they adamantly keep saying how additional fees will be likely. Great... so the inconvenience of sending it back for a few weeks plus additional fees for their mistakes. Oh well, live and learn.Overall, computer runs pretty well. Windows 8 is very incompatible with iTunes and CD burns. Computer is heavier than most but it seemed from past ratings that it lasts longer. I'm hoping for that.

I was so impressed with his, I decided, since my old HP was getting ready to die, to order and try this model Asus laptop. I'm pretty computer literate and I cant tell you how happy I am with this laptop. The Seller was great to work with and charged such a great price. Its fast...I mean fast. 6 gigs of ram and a I5 processor, a 750 gig hard drive, wow! I've read other computer suave people say the display was on the weak side on Asus laptop's but I have to disagree. This Asus K55A-DS51 has a true HD display and the included software for music, pictures and watching video and movies is excellent. I mean, I paid way more 6 years ago for another brand, which shall remain nameless, and it couldn't touch this one in any area. In closing, besides outstanding performance and battery life, its really a sharp looking laptop. I got the matching Mocha mouse and my family and friends want the exact model and mouse. I don't see how the Seller is making a profit selling this so cheap, but I'm so glad he/she is! As more and more people order Asus's, I'm sure the price for such a quality machine is going to rise. If you're looking for a good priced, good performance laptop, this is it .Oh , so glad Asus doesn't \"brand\" the heck out of their products, and the warranty is outstanding even against user mishaps...i.e. spilling things on, dropping etc., Outstanding!ASUS K55A-DS51", "Date": "August 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "great notebook", "Author": "L.
