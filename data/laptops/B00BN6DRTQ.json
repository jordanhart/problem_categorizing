{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Toshiba Waranty is no good. Don't Buy Toshiba", "Author": "Don Crow", "ReviewID": "R1HSHLHR8EZ0YE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop in july 2013. I even gave $28.00 for extended warranty. In Sept.2013 I turned it Off one night & went to bed. The next morning when I turned it on I got a screen asking for a BIOS password. I have never set a password for Bios. I could not get it on. So I called Toshiba support & told them about the Bios password problem. They had me try a few things while I was on the phone with them, but nothing worked. So they said I'd have to send it to their repair depot to be repaired. I had a choice of boxing it myself & sending it & be responsible for damages during shipping Or buy their box for $24.95. To be on the safe side I bought their $25.00 box. Four days after it arrived at their repair depot I got an email saying that repair was on hold because the main board had to be replaced & that it wasn't covered under warranty. I freaked!. I emailed the repair depot & ask them how could a 3 month old laptop main board not be covered under warranty. Four hours later they emailed me back & said I didn't send them a BIOS password & to either send them a BIOS password or $114.00 to repair it or it would be sent back to me unrepaired. Well I spent an hour on the phone with hump teen different people in Toshiba support. They all said that the BIOS password problem was not covered under the warranty even if I never set one. Bottom line..their warranty is useless. I told them to send it back to me unrepaired. LET IT BE KNOWN..TOSHIBA CORP.HAS GOT THE LAST PENNY FROM Don in Alabama. So if your thinking of buying a Toshiba product..you better hope you won't need the warranty. I actually have three Toshiba laptops but I will never buy a Toshiba product again because of this experience.Open this link  [...]", "Date": "September 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far, so good", "Author": "Deanne Adler", "ReviewID": "R1RE5TW2KTWNIN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm enjoying this computer and so far, after a couple of weeks, I'm having no problems with it. Windows 8 takes some getting used to but it's easier than I expected.  When I go into normal programs I use the desk top which is readily available in the start menu.  I don't use all of the programs in the start menu by choice.  Some of them are great. Others I just have no interest in. The display is beautiful and sharp. As of now I am very happy with this purchase.

My husband has a Toshiba laptop. I also have a Toshiba laptop which is several years old and needs replacing. We both have loved Toshiba. Not any more. The keyboard on this new one is very non-responsive (bad news for a touch typist like me) and the spacebar never responds unless I stop typing and press it very deliberatly and very hard.

For someone that is getting a laptop for the first time or wants something small that packs a punch to be used for business but still wanna play a few game (for me it was fifa 13) but still rock out to music, I can say this pc is capable of doing that.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worst laptop ever purchased", "Author": "Jill C. Howard", "ReviewID": "R35SZFAVH9154B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the worst laptop I have ever used. The keyboard is hard to use, the keys have to be struck hard, making speed typing impossible. The speakers are horrible. They sound tinny, and they crackle at higher levels. Burning CD's is impossible. The burned CD's skip all over the place. Customer service at Toshiba is non-existent.  I have owned this computer a little over 30 days and can't wait to replace it. Stick with Dell. It also takes forever to load. My 6 yr. old desktop loads faster than this laptop. Do NOT waste your money! The only bright spot is the customer service at Amazon. They are helping me to try to solve these problems.", "Date": "July 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!!!!", "Author": "Mackenzie Cooper", "ReviewID": "RFVCW3JOM63Q4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love this computer! arrived when it was supposed, everything is exactly perfect!

Although windows 8 took a little to get use to, this computer is fast and reliable. Can burn disks without much trouble, though I've noticed that if you move it around a lot while it's burning, the disk may turn out a little choppy. So I just set it down while it does it's thing. The speakers on the other hand are pretty bad, they don't project well at all. If you turn it up loud, it becomes crackly. I recommend using a nice headset or plugin speaker, as I use. Picture is great for movies, youtube, ect. So other than the sound, this laptop has made me happy since day one and its gets the job done. I'm very satisfied with my purchase.
