I'm an Apple lover.  If Apple makes it (or \"made\" it) I've got it.  I bought a slightly different model a little over a year.  Needless to say, I absolutely love it!  The more I used it, the more I fell in love in love with more hobbies; media, making music and videos, photography, web surfing, and software development.  All because I switched over from PCs to Mac!  Notice I said PC\"s\".  A Mac will in fact, last about 8-12 years.  As long as you take good care of it, it will fit inside that time frame and then some.", "Date": "May 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Info Not Disclosed", "Author": "Amuir", "ReviewID": "RAU65QPLS1NFL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Item not as pictured and note attached that Audio didn't work ( was not informed of this prior) -  Simple answer....I would'nt buy from seller again", "Date": "April 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Money well spent.", "Author": "Alicia Smith", "ReviewID": "R26VMIWS3PIJHU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I brought this computer for my daughter and it works like a charm.

It's perfect for anyone who can't afford to buy a newer model, and it works great with OS X Lion (if you upgrade the RAM). However, if you have the money, I'd suggest getting a newer model with a bigger hard drive, just so that it will not need to be replaced as soon to keep up with modern technology. Over all, I'd say it's a good product, though.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's works okay", "Author": "lorna", "ReviewID": "R3B275I9KKPDEQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This item is okay I would not really recommend this for due hundred $99 is not really worth it I can pick one up on craigslist for cheaper", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Macbook 13\" mid 2007 computer- I feel like I have a brand new computer and it works like one", "Author": "jasmine calhoun", "ReviewID": "R2ODMXLHCHLKCP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this notebook and I love it.Ive really wanted a mac for a very long time(I have an iPhone and am a fan of apple) and Ive had problems with PCs throughout the years getting multiple viruses and slowing down and literally breaking down and falling apart. I needed a new computer asap and couldn't afford the brand new macs and I was going to buy a brand new hp or something , however I came across this computer in my computer repair shop and couldn't resist it. This computer was so ahead of its time, so advanced. Mine is a mid 2007 mac and it works just like a brand new computer,its pretty fast and responsive. I have a gateway pc that is falling apart  that I bought around 2006, so I've been taking sometime to learn the mac system. Once I'm able to afford the brand new macs I will definitely purchase one of those,this computer is such great quality that it seems like it will last for years to come to hold me over. My mac is upgraded to to the 10.7 version and has 2gb memory and the hard drive is updated/upgraded to 320gb. I paid 300$ for it and I love this computer, i can't keep my hands off of it. =)", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "what i needed", "Author": "ron", "ReviewID": "R64O0SW2G3H7G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "came very early, the customer service was very helpful when resolving small issues,runs my installed photoshop great i upgraded the ram capacity to help productivity", "Date": "July 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "lost for words!", "Author": "Karina Stoute", "ReviewID": "R10U2VWJ7NEZZV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i am giving this seller/product 5 stars and will explain why:1. bought 2 13.3 inch white macbooks (old version) i think 2008 versions, the product condition was described as \"very good\", BUT when i opened the boxes i was surprised to find that both computers conditions were like new, on the outside just minor and almost non existent scratches (due to normal use - BUT if this is an issue for you, it can easily be corrected by buying a hard cover), screen did not have any scratches on it or the usual keyboard marks on it and the keyboard, trackpad, etc - everything in optimal conditions and immaculate (like new!!)2. Shipping - i was a bit nervous about the shipping of these, because it indicated that it was going to take almost one week to receive the laptops, BUT again really surprised on how fast i ended up receiving these - i purchased both on a friday and received my packages on Monday afternoon.So far i am really happy with my purchase, i might come back in a month or so to add a review about the performance (that has until now has been great), thank you pacific macs.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001ODOZDU"}}
