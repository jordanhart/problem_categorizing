{"Reviews": [{"Title": "So far, very pleased", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R22BW702L6B2P3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only had this a couple weeks. That said, I'm very pleased with it. I've moved from a 17-inch to this 15-inch. The 17-inch is supposed to be a \"desktop replacement\" that stays pretty much in one place, but I used it on my lap a lot. Naturally, this is a LOT lighter and more comfortable. Font and web-pages seem small, but that is probably because of the browser, web designers, and my eyesight, not the computer. So I just enlarge the pages often.The biggest plus for me may be the fact that it stays cool. My old laptop got burning hot on the left side. It doesn't say so here, but I seem to remember learning that this is a combination solid state drive and the usual disk hard drive. That would explain this. I think. Also, it supposedly uses the solid state to boot up and close down more quickly.There is a backlit keyboard option when you want it. Hold down Fn key, which is red and between the Left Control key and the Windows key, and press the space bar. The space bar also has a red color on that side.Being fif-cough-cough years old, I was surprised to like Windows 8. I'm usually the 'what-have-they-done-now' type. I find the windows or tiles on the home page attractive (now), customizable, and I'll get used to where things are sooner or later. You can always go to the button/tile for the old-fashioned style desktop whenever you like, but that seems clunky to me now. If you watch the explanatory videos and Youtube videos as well a few times, you get the hang of the Windows 8 basics. It is still important to me to access the file search option, etc. that are still on the desktop. So I do press the Desktop tile a lot, and work from there.Since I plan to use Microsoft Office 365 for Word, Excel, photos, etc., I didn't worry about the hard drive size too much. I did want good memory for running applications, and this seems more than adequate for me.It offers a touch screen, but I prefer to use the touchpad most of the time. I want to keep the screen as clean as I can, and the touchpad works well. In fact, sometimes it is too sensitive, and takes me where I don't want to go. I found this to be true with my earlier laptops as well. Also, if you rest your left hand to the left of the touchpad, it seems to affect the touchpad/laptop as well. So sometimes I have to lift my left hand when navigating to keep from doing something accidentally. This was also true of other laptops. No big deal.The keys seem shallow, which I quite like. They seem easier to push or something. I also like that it has a number pad. My Apple did not. My HP did, but the number pad was located in such a way that it made the keyboard a little offset from normal.I've enjoyed watching TV through my computer. As with many computers, you can watch it on its screen or connect to a TV to watch it on the big screen. I think the cable you need is called an HDMI cable, available at Target or wherever. This has great resolution. I've been watching my favorite TV shows on the computer for a long time now. So I get only the most basic cable TV. I may cut that as well, since my local news station is available online as well.It does not include a DVD player (optical drive), which is apparently common more often now. All of the ones I looked at were like this. It's a bit of a bummer, but I got a separate DVD player that will plug in when I need to install something from a CD instead of the web or when I want to watch a movie on DVD. I'm sure having it separate relieves some of the weight for your usual daily usage.In Windows 8, they've tried to integrate a lot of things to make computing more seamless or something. For example, they combine your Facebook, LinkedIn, and other social media into one place called People if you allow them. It also combines their address books. I haven't gotten used to this yet. I still go to my Facebook page separately, for example, but on this \"People\" application, you can update from there instead, as well as read other's posts. There are other things that are integrated, but I haven't got to them yet. I'm usually more concerned about privacy, but this time, I'm trying to go whole hog and let x communicate with y to see how convenient it is. I don't keep that much confidential data on my laptop. We'll see how that goes. You can always opt not to.I use Google Chrome as a browser most often, but some things work better with Internet Explorer. So I use that as needed. If I used IE exclusively, it would probably provide an even more integrated experience, but I like my Chrome.On a separate topic, I saw a presentation on what cloud computing is recently, and it convinced me to go with Office 365. That wasn't the aim of the workshop. It was about cloud computing in general. I just loved the idea of the cloud, although you may want hard copies on a flash drive as a backup to the cloud. The cloud company could go out of business, etc. 365 will store documents on the cloud so that I can reach them from any computer anywhere. It won't need hard drive space. Word, and the rest, will not have as many options for editing, which I'll miss. But it does offer these more important perks. I will love being able to call up photos from my in-law's computer to download photos of their grandson. You have to renew a subscription yearly, however, rather than buying Office to own.Hope this helps!4/26/14 updateI updated a few words above in hopes of making it clearer. Now for other updates. I still love this laptop.*Regarding the coolness of the laptop, in the winter, I wished for some heat. :) It stays cold no matter how long I use it. It will be nice this summer.*Regarding Windows 8, I don't use the Tile screen very much. I mostly use it to pick the Desktop tile, and work from there. It's what I'm used to. I had hoped I'd use the tiles more. When I end up on the Tile screen, I can use the tiles  to navigate back to Chrome with its tile. I can choose the Word tile, etc. But mostly, I stay in Desktop mode. I use File Explorer a lot. Though in Win 8, you are supposed to be able to search the computer from about anywhere. I haven't tried that.*It is hard for me to find a lot of things in Win 8 and Office 365 at first. So I use Help a lot. It's one way to learn. I'm old enough to remember when MS Office had mostly drop-down menus for functions. I still miss that. I hate those stupid ribbons at the top that display what I don't need and take up valuable real estate. Change is par for the course.*Regarding using the Cloud for most of my Docs, I do have an external hard drive to back up docs every now and then. I do save some docs to the hard drive. I like the cloud, however, for access anywhere, but I haven't had to access things elsewhere very much yet.*Regarding the lack of a DVD player, it is a pain. I would like a built-in DVD player for trips. Otherwise, the portable one does well enough for home, and I can use it in the car if I must. Mostly, however, I don't play DVDs. I watch online. In the comments, someone helped me figure out how to get the portable DVD player to work with movies. That application is well-rated, and I downloaded it from cNet, which I think is a safer place to download apps. FYI.Nothing much new. Just still enjoying it.

You can say it's a BMW- solid with engine more powerful than a regular driver needs.  It came out of a box wider than expected, thinner than regular ultra book is, with mac looks until open. On the bottom inside , it has a paneling, that kinda reminds the look of expensive dark wood floor, in the photo it looks much brighter that it really is. Where the aluminum paneling part ends on every edge and corner of laptop, you can feel its sharpness (literally). It's not  razor sharp and doesn't bother, but when  fingers slide over it ,it's catchy, just like testing how sharp the knife is. Keyboard is solid, well built and goes toward quiet type when you press it.  The screen is a complete identity of  mac book's screen (keeping it in comparison, because user of both of them). It's glossy with modern design.Let's turn it on...  Had to make sure it wasn't on a sleep mode straight out of a box, just how fast it turned up. But this was all about the  new windows 8, it loads extremely quick, no more details.  Screen picture colors enhancement is different than expected. Not an expert in laptops, but trying to explain:  white shade lays on top of the picture; when brightness decreased, screen quality looks better.. . Resolution is 1920x1080 as written in specs and produces impressive image quality; reflect the laptop screen on a full HD TV (with multiple purchase for wireless reflection or HDMI cable) and see how beautiful it really looks.  Keep in mind that,  low  quality picture on a high resolution laptop  looks worse than on a low resolution laptop.  1080p all the way, just make sure to get a right media player, and easily throw 30 Gb  blu- ray movies at it,  getting the best fps.  The I7 does its  job with 8 GB ram backup very well. No patience? Don't need any... Since  program installation till its use it never takes too long, no matter how big the program is.  ATTENTION!! - THIS IS NOT A GAMING LAPTOP!! It won't run any games, because DEDICATED GRAPHIC MEMORY IS  ONLY 48 MB. Don't think that laptop is not powerful enough IF it doesn't run games.This is a $900 model for serious people and not for kids who like to play. As mentioned before, lets compare again: this is BMW and games are races, as known  BMW is expensive car that has powerful engine, but is it meant for racing? - No. Easily find something cheaper and more efficient  for gaming than this, on the other hand solid gaming laptop price goes over a thousand $, this is a solid work laptop.  Sound is astounding. It \"has great and powerful sound card built in\". Approved it as a $ 250 headphones owner. Additional amplifier was always handy to run the cans on  any previous laptop used so far- Mac, Dell, Toshiba, Samsung. Present laptop produces better than perfect sound quality throughout audiophile headphones  with no additional devices.  It has speakers built in on left and right side of laptop. It's missing a cd drive only because of the additional speaker built-in on one of the sides ( that's how much this laptop was meant for sound). And don't worry, additional CD/DVD  driver can be purchased for this laptop if needed badly ( users manual offers it).  Laptop features work with no problem ( keyboard, screen touch, internet and etc.). Keep in mind, if any program doesn't run well it's NOT THE LAPTOPS problem, IT'S THE SOFTWARE. And Windows 8 is not the greatest one made. Has it's pros and cons.  Giving 4 stars because  personal Lenovo purchase was improperly treated while on shipping route (dropped or thrown on a ground while in a package)  or  experienced the minor fail while manufactured( which is always possible for any product) : Outer screen side is slightly damaged and couple keyboard buttons produce harsh sound when pressed. Not in a hurry to return it ( how much i like it), but will do it soon.Hope it helps to decide.", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Suprise!", "Author": "Bjoern", "ReviewID": "R3RV31L4SY12WS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a pretty good investment I did.I am a developer and security specialist - the laptop is used for such purposes. It came with Windows 8 pre-installed. It ran good, stable, no issues at all. I have used it with windows for about 3 weeks. Then due to the nature of my work I switched over to Debian Linux. Everything is supported, the Onboard Wifi 7260 works fine and is supported by iwlwifi - stable!The machine is light. I use it for programming and security testing. Its more than enough for it! I ran some VMs as well without problem (considering you need to enable hyperv in bios)USB3.0 is nice as well.Now, I am giving it 5 stars, because I got what I expected and for that price pretty much the best I found and I bought it on highstreet - not amazon! This being sad, I expected two things:1. The HDD sucks its 5400 rpm and not a SSD therefore, do not expect to much - I am thinking of putting a SSD in there sooner or later. That should speed up some operations :)2. Its an ultrabook. I did not expect a good battery life. Interestingly it does not allow you to change the battery in an easy fashion.

The Num Lock key get stuck on one side when pressed. Its not enough to affect the functionality but causes the key to be uneven until I press the other side of the key to free it.3. The right side of the trackpad clicks before it registers a right click. This causes me to have to press harder than expected when right clicking and produces an annoying double click sound.4. The 500GB HDD + 8GB SSD is a little small for not being upgradeable. Most other setups have a 25GB.5. The speakers are easy to obscure when using on you lap, cushion, blanket or anything else that is not a table.Pros:1. I7 Haswell is nice.2. The 1080p screen displays text and graphics clearly.3. The touchscreen is responsive.4. It is easy to enable/disable the backlight keys.Conclusion:The overall build quality is good with the exception of the keyboard and trackpad. IMHO it is not suited for the typical role as an Ultrabook. The speakers are too easy to obscure and the brightness of the screen is affected too much by the viewing angle. If the keyboard and trackpad were of better quality I would recommend this to people looking for a beautiful laptop that stays cool and has plenty of pony power.Note: Windows 8.1 sucks but that is not Lenovo's fault.

Well built, fast, with a great display and reliable touch-screen behavior. Light, easy to use on laps, doesn't get hot even on active tasks.In a few days with Win8, I now use touch-screen much often than a touchpad.The only concern could be the battery life. It lasts for 4.5-5 hours on active use or watching video. Won't last for a day w/o charging. From the other hand, not a big deal. 15\" size makes it more of a work machine rather than portable device.To sum it up, I'm totally satisfied with what I got for the price.", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "About what I expect from Lenovo", "Author": "Technology Whisperer", "ReviewID": "R2E9KE3RSBILYB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased this 2 months ago, to replace a Lenovo U330 model that was mostly disappointing in many regards.The big improvement so far over the old one is that it runs cool. Hoping that will continue, as the last one was a space heater as much as a computer! The vents became easily dust-clogged, which reminds me to get a can of compressed air to clean those regularly.The only aspect of Windows 8.1 that I'm using often is the touch screen for pressing larger buttons on screen (smaller ones are too easy to miss so work better with the touch-pad control). The default Metro screen is mostly cluttered with rubbish apps from both Microsoft and Lenovo (and their partners who paid to get their junk included). Useless to me, I use a more traditional desktop nearly always. Try out the Pokki menu add-on, it adds some nice functionality for easy launching of favorite items.Battery performance so far has been quite good, I'm wondering how long this will last... was very disappointed in the battery in previous Lenovo pc. This is the first laptop I've owned that doesn't have an easily swapped battery, fingers crossed on that.Biggest complaint so far is with the keyboard/touch design and layout. The touch-pad area is bigger than need be, which makes it easy to brush your palm on it when typing and getting some unintended reactions.  Most offensive though is the small right shift key placed next to the up arrow key. Very poor design, I'm constantly having the cursor jump up a row while typing because of this.  I'm using an external keyboard much more than I'd like due to this annoying behavior.Processing speed is a big improvement, I'm often editing large audio/video files and have noticed much faster times in processing and saving changes to these items. The built-in speakers are decent for a laptop, but more often I use headphones or connect via HDMI to my TV and use its audio output.I was between 3 and 4 stars but had to choose one.

I got it through Amazon Prime, so I am enjoying the benefits.  Lenovo gave me a full year warranty upon registration, so I am happy about that.About the laptop..... First opinionsLove:-  The screen is beautiful, big and clear.  I have lots of real estate to keep two applications working side by side.  The keyboard is really nice with lots of bells and whistles.  The keys are a bit different from other laptops, so it takes a bit of getting use to.  The touch pad is okay, though right click is annoying (another reviewer stated this issue). However, I use a wireless mouse, so it is not an issue for me.  The touch screen works great, though it does tend to messy if your fingers are not perfectly clean.  The weight is less than I expected for such a large laptop, and the keyboard is mostly cool to the touch (the hard drive is in the middle of the keyboard, not under the hand rests like the Toshiba laptops).  Some of the Lenovo software is cute, though most of it is bloat.  With that said, there was very little bloat-ware compared to an HP or Dell.Hate:- Windows 8.0 is preloaded.  It is beyond horrible (and I am an IT specialist).  It took me about 10 hours to update to Windows 8.1, which is somewhat better.  However, if you download and install ClassicShell (free), it becomes more user friendly.  The Hard Drive is somewhat slow compared to a static drive.  So later today, I am planning to swap the current HDD for an SSD.  The new Windows 8 Apps UI is atrocious.  So if you are looking for the Windows Vista or Windows 7 feel, install ClassicShell, then the laptop becomes mighty fine.Overall:- It is a good laptop.  I don't regret buying it.  However, if setting up Windows is not your thing and you don't like or know Windows 8, this may not be the most user friendly-out-of-the-box laptop on the market.", "Date": "May 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great!", "Author": "FatedCb \"Every one of us has a purpose here.\"", "ReviewID": "R30U5DGNQN07VU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Laptop will do all your daily tasks with ease!
