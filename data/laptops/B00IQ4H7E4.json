{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Love at first Game!", "Author": "JoJo", "ReviewID": "R2DLAU80LPMVI8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Since I am a faithful amazon Shopper, I waited for what seemed forever for Amazon to release this and after 4 weeks and nothing, I took the plunge and purchased this at Newegg. I did not get the Amazon Prime shipping speed I have become so accustomed to but nonetheless received my item!Just taking this baby out of the box was a pleasure. It is VERY light for all the computing horsepower underneath the hood, per say. I proceeded to do all the updates and then Decrapify it from some bloatware and the  installed my steam account and whola! I fell in love with this after my first gaming session. It really runs all modern games extremely well and is not too loud when it begins to warm up after 2 hours of play.My review is mainly to state how happy I am with my purchase and my personal experience with this item. If you'd like in depth review with specs and all, I would suggest YouTube. There are plenty of reviews there. Actually, that is what I did before my purchase. I love the videos that have the unboxing and then actual usage of the laptop. They give a clear view of what you are getting.", "Date": "April 24, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,699.99", "Features": "Intel Core i7-4700HQ 2.4 GHz (6 MB Cache)\n16 GB DDR3L SDRAM\n1 TB 7200 rpm Hard Drive, 128 GB Solid-State Drive\n15.6-Inch Screen, NVIDIA Geforce GTX860M with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM\nWindows 8.1", "Name": "MSI GS-Series GS60 GHOST-003;9S7-16H212-003 15.6-Inch Laptop", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41WR5M1%2B9cL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00IQ4H7E4"}}
