You will love the the extra light weight, you barely feel anything on your lap.SRS Premium Sound integrated gives you a complete personalization of your sound quality. As on the description, you have a 640GB Hardrive that will hold all your musics, videos, games, movies, etc...I also found the Intel Turbo Boost Technology very handy when it comes to run heavy programs at the same time, it gives you that extra boost(up to 3Ghz)when you need it.Bluetooth also integrated (couldn't ask for more). Battery life is pretty decent for a Windows laptop(up to 4hrs on Balanced power plan).Sleek and professional design.Webcam can deliver HD videos which is simply amazing.Finally, the processor is so \"robust\" that even when you have many programs running at the same time, your CPU usage is usually less than 20%.Great value for the price, would greatly recommend it to laptop buyers.", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,499.99", "Features": "Intel Core i5-480M processor 2.66GHz (up to 2.93GHz with TurboBoost technology), 3MB Cache\n6GB DDR3 system memory\n640GB SATA hard drive\nIntel Centrino Wireless-N 1000 WLAN\n15.6\" diagonal HD WLED widescreen display Intel HD Graphics", "Name": "Dell Mars Black 15.6\" Laptop PC with Intel Core i5-480M Processor, 6GB RAM, 640GB Hard Drive, Windows 7 Home Premium", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qiAPJ7kTL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004TD0SS8"}}
