I bought it for pleasure and also work travel because it is so light weight.  I loaded Office 2010 on the machine and it's almost unbearable to use.  It is unresponsive and balks all the time.  I am only using outlook most of the time.  You become so frustrated with it I just don't use it.  It is slow to respond, I never did get the wireless mouse to recognize so I just don't use it.  The table itself holds a 4 hour charge but the key board will not.  I think your better off with the Surface.", "Date": "June 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Simply amazing tablet!", "Author": "Jeffrey Rayos", "ReviewID": "R3NMKZAZGGJETF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Simply amazing just the right tablet needed for my job!

Easy to travel with as it is very light.  Keyboard life not to good you have to charge it regualarly.

King \"Red Bow Girl\"", "ReviewID": "R23SZ0E7JLQTOZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great choice for students like myself. This ultrabook is lightweight and compact enough to fit into my backpack with lots of room to spare for all of my books and paper notebooks. Getting used to the new layout and operating system is the only thing I struggled with, but even that was short-lived. I would have given the ultrabook five stars but the product description said that it included Microsoft Office 2013; however it did not. I had to purchase the Microsoft Office 2013 software separately.", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "GREAT STUFF!", "Author": "Selomit", "ReviewID": "R12348C08W3QN5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it. Everything works so well, it even comes with a little bluetooth mouse. Windows 8 is a bit confusing in the beginning but once you get used to it it's pretty good. The device is awesome and it's not that difficult to detach from the case", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Acer Aspire P3-171-6820 11.6-Inch Convertible 2-in-1 Touchscreen Ultrabook...", "Author": "MonJ", "ReviewID": "R19AOYK7AB3ESW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It took time for me to give my review for this product (Acer Aspire P3-171-6820 11.6-Inch Convertible 2-in-1 Touchscreen Ultrabook), coz I have to test drive and subject it to various test.My own verdict 4.5 STARS, I like this product, nothing beats it because of the price I have bought it against the specs and features...WOW!!! I refurbished more than the new-new ones, coz you can buy them half the price.I have encountered some obstacles along the test, but it is overcomeable......I have formatted it and installed Windows 8.1, it's not easy to install all of the components (trial and error). I can't upgrade into Windows 8 Pro, because the license is pre-loaded in BIOS. Before my re-installation, battery was draining overnight though its shutdown. For some reason after my re-installation battery works perfect now. Lastly, I wish that it was assembled with a better graphics card, something like with GPU, but I guess price will go up. I made some revision with the docking station that comes with it so that you can easily take it out and use it as tablet.At any point I like this product very much it has 3rd Gen i5, 120GB SSD, Convertible-Ultrabook. Great product. I did not hesitate taking it (though it's more than $500) because I have a previous Acer Tablet Iconia W500, until to this it is working great. I think it is safe to say that Acer have greatly improved to their design and quality.", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "good tablet", "Author": "JOHN R MCGRAIL", "ReviewID": "R2J430B0TQYQQ6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Tablet works well.
