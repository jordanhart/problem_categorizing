I was disappointed on the misleading hard drive capacity specs, as it doesn't have quite that much free space apparently due to \"formatting\" but overall am quite happy with product.

I just moved from a 13.3\" screen, so this laptop seems gigantic to me and it's taking some getting used to, but for the price I got it (lightning deal), it was really an amazing deal, and the performance is great.  I use this for watching streaming media online, using Office applications like spreadsheets or presentations, or surfing the web. It does all of that with ease, quickly, and isn't too hot nor too loud. I sometimes even use it to log on to WoW (world of warcraft game) just to do some basic things, and it does pretty well with that as well.", "Date": "January 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent for the price", "Author": "Maria-Lourdes", "ReviewID": "R2ZCPAOQVT77CP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm very happy with my new laptop toshiba.
