{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Solid, fast, lightweight.", "Author": "Gordon S. Marlowe", "ReviewID": "R3I8IK4SNUOY0L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This machine has a solid, all metal construction, with the only plastic being the keys and the bezel surrounding the screen. It is quite fast with a 2nd gen core i CPU and an AMD 6630 GPU.  Keyboard is one of the best I've ever used, and easy match for any thinkpad, and backlit to boot.  The 1600x900 matte screen is bright and very clear, but lacks color depth and contrast for any kind of high quality, color accurate display.Other reviews have referred to it as flimsy but honestly, this is a pretty solidly built machine.  Pressure on the back of the lid produces no distortions in the display, the base is very very stiff, especially for such a thin machine.  Overall this machine reminds me of the T4x series thinkpad I used to own, but with a much brighter screen.The speakers are terrible, even for a small 13\" machine.Linux compatibility has some issues that will hopefully get ironed out.  Nothing that makes using it unusable, but a few things like the trackpad not having any suitable drivers, and really poor battery life (under linux) that make it a questionable choice if Linux on the go is your primary reason for using this machine.", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not one issue", "Author": "Mark J. Tierney \"coastie 1980\"", "ReviewID": "R3OE9ZGQLM87JQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used my laptop for a few days now and put it through some different trials.  I tried videos, no problems, the only thing I wish could of been a little better was the sound of the speakers, but that's just the style of the laptop, it's hard to concentrate on both light and slim and at the same time have insanely large speakers.  Next I inserted a few CD's including a movie which played perfectly and very clear, again the speakers are loud enough, just a little high pitched.  You can always plug in a set of aux speakers if you wish.  I installed a couple simple action games to make sure they would load and play and again no problem.  I miss the old Sony power switch on the end of hinge, now it's like most other laptops positioned directly above the number keys.  One more adjustment I had to make was getting used to a dedicated dvd eject button above the number keys again.  You can't just push in on the dvd play door any more.  Not a big deal and once I get use to it I'll be fine.  I really like the 1600 resolution option on this particular model, if your wondering about text size, my philosophy is that you can always turn up the zoom of the page to 125% and most web pages still fit on the screen.  The keyboard is nicely backlit and the keys have enough space between them so you don't hit two at once.  I only wish with the new hinge setup that it didn't have that plat in the rear of the laptop, it's centered and runs better than half way across and sticks out a bout an 1/8\".  Not a big deal, but again, I liked the old style Sony hinge better personally.  The new hinge cover is finished nicely though, looks like brushed metal.  All of the input/output connections, except for the dvd player are on the right side of the laptop, I prefer this because it's easier for me to remember what side it's one.  There are 3 indicator lights in the front left and look nice.  There is a cap key light above the numbers.  The laptop feels well made to me and I have no regrets.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "quality machine", "Author": "RomansRoad", "ReviewID": "R36012JSHF1K8O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I looked at all similar units in the 800 to 1200 price range, and chose this one for the keyboard ease, backlight, and robust construction. It is substantially made, mostly of aluminum/magnesium alloy, and the matte display is outstanding. Other units had the gloss and the glare is quite distracting. You pay a bit more for the Sony name, but it is worth it. It has the usual bloatware, but not overly intrusive, and one can disable these pesky bits easily. It is remarkably light, yet not flimsy in the slightest. I'm using it in my surgical office for electronic records, CT scan image review and other fairly processor intense tasks and the i5 handles all quite rapidly. I did up the RAM to 8mb, and that was $14 well spent! Got mine from 42nd street photo in NYC, and all is well. I would recommend it highly.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Thin, light, speedy little notebook", "Author": "ChrisFu", "ReviewID": "R15247N574AT0V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this laptop because its basically the only machine out there with the combination of features I wanted, and it costs less than a grand to boot.-Backlit keyboard - very difficult to find in this size, much more effective than the little thinklight on Thinkpads-Hi resolution 1600x900 screen - just try find this feature outside of Dell enterprise workstation models-USB 3.0 onboard-Fingerprint reader-Dedicated Radeon graphics - seems like nearly every PC is using the crappy Intel HD integraded chips in their 13.3\" and smaller models-Aluminum unibody - I'm really confused by the reviews describing this laptop as \"flimsy\" or claims that its not actually metalHave been using the machine for about a week now and its simply impressing me at every turn. After uninstalling the bulk of the Sony bloatware, Ive got it setup quite cleanly rather than doing a full clean windows install (as mentioned by another reviewer who was having difficulty).Runs every game I've thrown at it in native resolution (1600x900) so far, including BF3 and MW3, which is jawdropping. Having a portable gaming system thats this svelte is going to make traveling a heck of a lot more enjoyable. It quite simply blows the doors off my last \"thin and light\" acer timeline.All in all, a good purchase and a happy camper.

I bought it more than a year ago, seemed like quite good but now I'm about to smash it into pieces because I can't stand the fan noise anymore. The fan keeps working even there is nothing bothering CPU. I've tried to update the BIOS firmware but it didn't work. I think the reason is it's manufactured with a design problem. When you open the lid, it just covers the fan air exit.As a result, I don't recommend anyone to buy this laptop.", "Date": "September 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Laptop", "Author": "Kyaw", "ReviewID": "R18TPQXSCGJ2A9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this about one yr ago and it is still perfect condition and working great.But fan sound is quite noise though.", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "rawbert", "ReviewID": "R23VTFF9OT99SB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I will make this quick. Having owned and had success with previous Sony computer products, I was excited about getting another Sony product. For the last several years I have been using an IBM Thin Pad, a great machine. Knowing I had luck in the past with Sony, I felt my decision to move away from the IBM to Sony was a good one, unfortunatly for me it was not.I bought my new Sony about a year ago online. I customized it for my uses but the base system had Windows 7 and and Intel Core i5. From day one this computer took forever to start up and it has only gotten worse. It now takes my laptop 10-15 minutes fron a cold start to be ready for use, even then many programs stall to start, it is very frustrating. Once startd I still find it difficult to multi-task with more then 4 programs. Switching between Word, Excel, Outlook and PowerPoint causes major hick ups as I tan through each program. This is my biggest complaint.The other issue is the fan noise, its very loud. I saw this in previous reviews but decided it couldn't be that bad, wrong.They only saving grace, and the only reason I gave two stars instead of 1, is the battery life. I opted for the sheet battery which gives me plenty of juice on cross-continental flights, that is nice.Overall I am disappointed with the laptop and will most likly never go back to Sony computing again, back to IBM.", "Date": "September 12, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005JY9F9Y"}}
