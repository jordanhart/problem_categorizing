Microsoft Office 2000 installed and worked flawlessly.The D510 I bought came with only a CD-ROM drive, but then again, I paid less than $30 for it, and that included the cost of Priority Mail shipping. I seriously wouldn't pay more than $50. I bought it as a gift for a person who had no computer at all, and she is very happy with the laptop.The gift receiver has been diagnosed with an extremely rare and incurable illness, and she told me recently that she feels empowered having the ability to access information she needs online at the snap of her fingers. So even a laptop which seems to be outdated and useless to some people, is a gift of life to someone else.", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "great price", "Author": "Guido", "ReviewID": "RDOFOR0ZDT6Q0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchase this just to do email and office book keeping it works great and have not had any problems with it  I will be purchasing more for the office", "Date": "February 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Older Computer serves me well", "Author": "Keith Bernhagen \"Keith Bernhagen\"", "ReviewID": "RP5NE1E9K6I9M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It seems to be a good lap top and serves my purpose to run program software that had become obsolete by the continued advancement of new windows operating systems", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Old and slow, but meets my expectations", "Author": "Douglas H.", "ReviewID": "R3P072MFMZESAM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "While it's slow and has only Microsoft Explorer software on it, it suited my needs and was delivered quite promptly.
