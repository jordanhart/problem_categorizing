Light but still has a DVD player, backlit keyboard is nice too. I use the touch screen way more than I thought, but the screen needs a cleaning more often. Great powerful laptop for the price. The last star got lost because of Windows 8. Don't like the combined log in for many applications, don't want to use f***book nor a windows email, one password doesn't fit all !", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Dell laptop", "Author": "Richard A. Porter", "ReviewID": "R2OE3NYGV1KX4W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very pleasantly surprised by the ease of operation after reading and hearing of so many unhappy people regarding Windows 8.  My wife is a 7 power user but I am an XP person.  It's her new computer but she has taught me how to navigate and I am seriously thinking of going this way April 6th.I am a windows phone 8 user which helped somewhat to understanding apps and swiping, but I really like no tabs and the clean UI.The computer has everything she needs.  She replaced her win 7 laptop with this one so the mouse monitor, keyboard, printer and carrying bag all were usable.  All win7 programs worked on this computer.We have only purchased Dell since 2000 and have always been happy, happy, happy!Highly recommend.UPDATEPrice went up quite a bit so I updated my Dell desktop to Vista which was already on the computer.  After some rough spots, it performs well.  I will wait for this laptop to come back down to earth price wise and reconsider moving to it again.Wife is still very happy and I occasionally use it.  Very easy to move back and forth between 8 & Vista but,  my wife wants her office to switch from 7 to 8.  She  only wants it if all monitors are also changed.  She keeps swiping at her screen at work (ha ha).  We shall see.", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing Deal!", "Author": "Upta Camp", "ReviewID": "R1UBMH48EF0RW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Initial Thoughts:-  Aluminum case is very nice, the backlit keyboards and touch screen all work together to make for a nice fit and finish. Although the screen doesn't go to the edge I prefer this for swiping in for settings and such in W8. The computer booted up very fast and all restarts were very quick, love the SSD!-  After installing all 74 automatic updates I was able to update to 8.1 for free, but I had to do the updates first.Pros:- Fit and finish great for the money.- Onboard graphics are surprisingly good, I play many games from Second Life to Steam downloaded games (Rust Alpha runs well and is brand new). The HD video playback is great.- Great audio!- Amazing multi-tasking and fluidity in screen changes. It does a lot and it does it effortlessly- All 4 USB are 3.0 vs others with 1/4- Value, Value, Value!Cons:- Battery while gaming is about 2hours, maybe 5 hours of regular internet usage. No idea where they get 7hours from and this is only a con because of their unrealistic claim. Had they said 5hours I'd be pleased. If battery life matters to you take note that THE BATTERY IS NOT  REMOVABLE!Conclusion:- I think this is a great buy. It is a very high end laptop for the money and with the SSD and touch screen you really are getting a good deal. I wish some people would review the laptop more and windows 8 less.", "Date": "February 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love the laptop", "Author": "nasser", "ReviewID": "R2JFIVPDPJLOHQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the laptop with good expecations from Dell.

Dell has what is called a HYPERDRIVE First NO  SSD 32GB - that's false you only have an 8GB cache. A good thing because it will speed up you're most visited site.  Second You will have about 450 GB of space due to he recovery and misc partitions.  The features of a lit keyboard, Bluetooth, 6GB ram, 500GB HHD and i5 cpu combo with any other brand will cost you over $725.  This laptop started at $612 now it jumped to $690.

It runs Windows 8, which people tend to love or hate (I'm that rare 'meh' bird) which is important to consider. It doesn't come with any bells or whistles, or practical applications, and Microsoft Office is spendy so be prepared for that extra cost. As far as size, it's reasonable, and the the nice large screen is good for anyone who likes big pictures.BUT.My screen has some sort of air-bubble along the top edge of the screen. That might be the product of a minor manufacturing defect with the touchscreen, but IT'S THERE. It's not getting bigger, so that's... Good? But it also won't go away, no matter what I try!In addition, I'm not sure that it's a great investment when similarly powerful computers are getting smaller and more compact, and DO come with all the bells and whistles. If I had to do it all again, I might opt for the FAR less expensive ASUS Transformer tablet (which comes pre-loaded with MS Office), and that will definitely be my option for the kids school computers.", "Date": "June 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Really good buy", "Author": "Aravind Rajagopal", "ReviewID": "RVD302NA7Y7UT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop in January and the price was $600 then.

I like the backlit keyboard.  I don't like that the viewing angle on the screen is so small - 10% off center up and down, and the picture quality suffers.  But, they're pretty much all like that.  The price is great for a unit like this; it's got ALL the faetures you want - SSD, touchscreen, backlit keyboard, i5 processor.  But I don't know how the can call this \"ultra\", as in ultra light?  No.  I have a several-year old Toshiba - plastic and thicker - that weighs less.  But it's not touchscreen.I'm debating sending this back for a smaller and lighter unit, but... I probably won't find one for this price.  I like having the big screen, but I hate having the weight for something I intend to carry around now.
