I got my MacBook last week, and here's what I think so far.For those who are strictly into PC Games and such, you shouldn't get this computer. I have a brother who is a gamer and he's religiously oppsed to Apple (I kid you not). If you want an all around computer that is designed to run smooth and has lots of great features a PC would never think of, then a Mac Book is a great purchase. I just would recommend thinking hard about what you are after and making your decision based on that.For me, I want to learn how to cut and create video, and burn great DVDs. So this is a great fit. And yeah, it's not easy to go from one system to the next, but if you are patient you get it.I do have to say that I love the design a lot. A fantastic touchpad that is more user friendly, and light machine that is easy to transport and carry to work, a quiet processor that runs cool and doesn't make noise or get hot to the touch. I also love that the power cord is magnetized and will pull away from the machine if a careless child races by and catches it. I had my PC knocked to the floor once when my 3 year old tripped on the cord.Overall, a wonderful machine. Still trying to adjust and learn things, but I feel like this was well worth it. Higly recommended.UPDATE**** I have now had my Mac for about 4 months. I cannot live without this machine. I take it to work with me and use it there every day. Seriously? Aside from my two kids and cat, I do not love anything in this world as much as I love this computer. The Operating System is much easier to understand, the touchpad is a wonder and I feel like I have finally slipped into something that makes sense and FITS. When I do have to go back and attempt to work a PC, I can feel the difference. I struggle with it. I will never go back. This computer is worth the investment. I would recommend if you spend the money to consider getting the max memory. I ordered straight from Apple Store for that reason.

After much campaigning and convincing, I finally convinced them. After a few days, I was completely adjusted to the system coming from using Windows my whole life. I find the Mac system more efficient, easier to use, more advanced, and overall completely amazing. Some of my favorite features include the incredible trackpad, expose, photobooth, the face recognition feature on iPhoto, the easy to use dock, and of course iChat.If you are looking for an easy to use computer that has lots of useful features and an amazing battery life, this computer is for you.

A macbook is a perfect notebook and I have been using mac for a really long time.It is faster, better in performance, prettier, thinner than equivalent models from other manufacturers.The best thing of all is that you run MAC OS X. This operating system is way advanced than any other operating system and you can easily term it the best.Considering the price, it is almost the same as any other laptop and you will not need to buy any anti virus software either.Macbook pro is awesome, but I would call it pricey.

I've been using my MacBook for a week now, and helping my family with their computers in the past few days (Yeah, I'm the tech guy for the family) I have found myself missing what I can do easier on my Mac.It is solidly constructed, the user interface is pleasing and intuitive to me. I really like the touchpad. The multi-finger gestures are just brilliant. Why has no one thought of this before now?I was apprehensive about the keyboard. However it has a very consistent and pleasing feel to type on. The large wrist rest area is quite nice. It is \"slick\" plastic, though, so in the summer, I might not like it as much. We'll see.The rubber on the bottom keeps it from sliding on your lap, limits the feeling of cooking your lap that most laptops give you, again, another smart idea.The display is magnificent. I loaded up some of my pictures and I found myself really enjoying just watching them scroll through in the screen saver. Very sharp and crisp.My only real gripe so far is that Mac accessories (whether from Apple or 3rd parties) seem over-priced. Not sure why that is. But this is no different than iPod accessories, in my opinion. It's irritating, and requires more shopping to get what you want at a reasonable price.", "Date": "January 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Machine!", "Author": "Michael F. Mitsch", "ReviewID": "R27TGOQKGVYM9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Really excellent computer.  Got it as a gift for my daughter and she loves it!  Much easier to use than a Windows PC!", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "First time mac user, but not yet ready to completely abandon windows", "Author": "C. Wang", "ReviewID": "R1BYS0IMDL9RUA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've always wanted to buy a mac, even more so after seeing them roaming the college campus, even all my professors show up in lecture with them. When I saw this particular white glossy macbook being sold for [...] after rebate, along with lots of bonus, I impulsively bought one. So far, I do not for a bit regret my purchase. However, maybe I put in way too much expectations on this entry level macbook, I have not been overly impressed. Before I started using mac, I have been an avid pc user my entire life. Vista was a huge let down, but windows 7 really picked up the pace. I was a very happy pc user, but I also wanted to experience the mac os. So here is my initial impression of the macbook.Mac OS:The interface is gorgeous, and almost fun to fiddle around with. The various visual effects, genie effect of max&min; windows, expose, spaces, magnifying dock, and etc, really make the revamped windows 7 aero effect look pale in comparison. Also, the main difference that I noticed between the mac os and windows is that the mac os is amazingly simple. In windows, they used to put my video, my music, my pictures folders all in my document, in vista and onward, they created individual folders under the user name, and there are a bunch of folders for public access, and it usually took me at least 3 clicks to access the download folder. Not to mention the countless folders within computer>local disk. In mac, everything is categorized in a very simple fashion. On the dock, there is a folder for download, which can be accessed with 1 click. Your photo, music, and videos are all organized with iphoto and itune respectively. (Even though there is also itune on windows, but it seems to work better on mac) Before I just tuck away my photos in folders under my pictures, but now I actually check them out occasionally in iphoto. I wonder if it is because the software is readily available to me that is making me pay more attention to my pictures. Also for application installations, it's a totally different methodology on the mac. Unlike in windows where each application when installed, creates a folder in program files, most of the mac applications are self-contained packages. All the files the program needs to run are packaged within the program icon. All I do is drag and drop the program into the application folder. Uninstalling is also uber easy, I just delete the icon. But installing AppTrap is recommended to remove remnant files. (Wonder why that function isn't built-in) Also, I've found a list of miscellaneous features that are a lot easier on the mac. Unlike windows where the system comes in different languages for machines bought in different countries, so if you need the os to be in another language, you need to install that version of windows. For mac, the system language can be changed by going into system preferences, and basically any language is supported. This is really helpful for my parents who aren't so adept in English. One of the greatest thing I love about the mac is its multi touch trackpad. It basically imports the whole iphone gizmo onto the mac, along with several new gestures. Windows 7 picked up the two finger scroll, but that's about it, unless you install third-party program to enable other gestures. I particularly love the four finger vertical scroll, which I found very intuitive. Swipe up to show the desktop and swipe down to show all windows (expose). A side function enabled by the trackpad is the hand writing recognition. As for now, it only seems to support chinese. The trackpad basically acts as a mini tablet, on which you can write chinese characters. I found that to be very cool, though not so practical. Also, to debunk the common \"no right click\" myth, two finger tap pops up the secondary menu, similar to that in windows. These are all features that have amazed me thus far, I'll update as I learn more about the os.What prevents me from completely transitioning to the mac os is its limited application support. For those major softwares: microsoft office, firefox, photoshop, dreamweaver, skype, and etc, there are mac versions. But more specialized or less well known softwares such as matlab, solidworks, autocad, and software developed in foreign countries do not support mac. Some of the online games I used to play also do not support mac. I am not a big gamer, so I can live without them. Even though apple advertises that \"mac is the only computer you'll ever need\" because mac can also run windows. There are three major ways of doing that, the built-in bootcamp, vmware fusion, and parallel. I know for bootcamp, you basically load into the windows os at power up, but that seems awfully isolated. So I use fusion, which came free with my mac. I would say running windows 7 within the mac os as another program is awesome, but it's cumbersome. Maybe I need to upgrade for more memory. Running windows-only programs via fusion takes a while to launch, and the graphic can be choppy. Fusion does seem more integrated than bootcamp, but still not ideal. If one day apple and microsoft ever work together to create an operating system that uses mac's infrastructure and windows's compatibility and price tag, that'll be hallelujah for all computer users.Hardware:Like its inside operating system, the outside is very aesthetically appealing. Continue with what I mentioned above with mac being simple, the laptop design follows the same principle. The hardware components are visibly divided into the unibody casing, one piece rubber bottom, ports, sleep light, screen, keyboard, trackpad, camera, and almost unnoticeable microphone. Everything is white, glossy (except for keyboard and trackpad), and very fragile. I dented the outside cover minutes after unboxing, when my flashdrive dropped onto the macbook. Afterward, while I was typing, with my wrist watch on, I made several hairline scratch on the palm rest (why would they make the palm rest glossy as well???) The power cord, which snaps on with the strong magnet, has managed to make irregular ridges on the plastic casing around the power port. So my partial solution right now is to install a clear plastic casing, at least that protects the outside. The ports is minimal, but sufficient for my daily use. One thing I do want is the sd slot, but that can be remedied with an adapter. I would also really like a hdmi port, but that has not become available on any mac, so I can't complain. The screen looks exceptionally bright and crisp. Not sure if it's the screen itself or the graphic card. The keyboard, oh I love the chiclet keyboard. My fingers bounce freely on the very responsive keys, and they're so widely spaced that I make far less mistakes than on my traditional keyboard. The trackpad is very intuitive to use. I normally use a mouse on a laptop, but with the trackpad so easy to use, I can free up that usb port. The camera is mediocre, 1.3 mp I heard. I tried out photobooth, the picture quality really no better than the webcam on my HP laptop. Lastly, for the speakers, I hate them. I know the sound quality on a laptop is not supposed to sound good, but the macbook speakers are below average. The treble carries a hissing sound, uncomfortable for prolonged listening. I usually use a pair of headphone. I wondering if that's standard among all macbook or it's just mine that's defective. One last thing to mention is the battery life. Last night I was trying to drain the battery fast for calibration, so I turned on the screen brightness to max, bluetooth wireless all on, and watch videos on hulu for the entire time via headphone, the battery lasted around 4.5 hours. If you're to use it normally, reading articles online, watching youtube occasionally, do some light processing work, the battery could easily reach the advertised 7 hours mark. The laptop itself is fairly light for its class, so carrying it for an entire day on campus should require no recharging.These are all I think think up right now. I now do most of my every day computing on the mac, it's just a joy to use. But when it comes to programs that only run on windows, I would rather turn on my old hp laptop instead of running windows within mac.", "Date": "December 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "The best computer I ever got.

It still requires tinkering for example apple doesnt include support for AVI among countless other formats. Quicktime sucks bollocks I recommend Mplayerx or pretty much everything else is better than quicktime. I owned it since it came out in 2010. Ive never gotten a virus or malware. The computer has never crashed even once since I owned it (only the apps have crashed mainly safari and iPhoto). With Windows or Linux the whole computer crashing happened often and I would have to hold down the power button to restart it. However I have sometimes had to press the power button- sometimes the screen just turns black and doesnt light up after suspend. It is not suspending as I can hear the normal noises emanating from the pc (yes it is a personal computer just one that uses mac and not windows or linux or unix or other more obscure operating systems). Usually plugging and unplugging the power cable does the trick and the screen turns on.Another problem is the cracks caused by the heat. This is a known problem for polycarbs since the first non unibody came out. So I though would i rather have a crackbook or a dentbook pro? I went with the crackbook because I am a student and carry it around a lot. And the screen is not glass like the dentbook. Also they had a defect where the rubberized aluminum bottom would peel.

A few years ago we were able to take a PC laptop that she was using for a work project on a week long trip to Colorado. It was great being able to load our pictures, surf the web and email our friends while on vacation. So we decided to get our own laptop last year as we were taking two trips to celebrate our 20th anniversary this April, the first one to Scotland last December and last week to the Sedona/Flagstaff area in northern Arizona. We looked at PC laptops and Macs. We went with the Macbook because they were supposed to be more reliable than PCs and we liked the look and feel of it. On our trip to Scotland the email (Mail) quit working. After we got home I called our internet provider to find out what the problem was. It had lost our password for Mail and after I reentered it in the Mail preferences we could send and receive email again. Our first day out last week on our second trip, our six months old Macbook locked up on me while I was shutting it down after doing a little web surfing. So I shut it down manually by pushing the power button. I have used Macs at work since the mid '80s and have shut them down this way after they have locked up more times than I can count. This time however, for the first time ever, the Mac would not reboot. We have babied this machine. We always let it go into sleep mode before we move it around while it is still on. I tried to do a disk repair on the hard drive from the disk for the operating system that you get with the computer as instructed in the manual and that did not work. I now have to get a friend at work who is good with computers to back it up, wipe the hard drive clean & reload the operating system and software. Why I'm having to do this on a 6 month old machine is beyond me. It completely failed the second time we tried to use it for the main purpose it was purchased for. Before this I was relatively happy with it. Now it is hard for me not to think of it as a \"piece of crap\". I'm praying that it is a software issue and not a hardware problem (bad hard drive). So much for Macs supposed reliability.Update.My buddy at work could not do anything for it either. He did however, tell me where an authorized Mac repair shop was in town. I had thought that you had to take it to a Mac Store  (not one in Tally) or ship it back. I dropped it off at 11:30 am one day & had it back at 10:30 am the next with it's new hard drive installed (no charge). They were not able retrieve the data from the old drive. Fortunately we did not lose to much, I had burned our Scotland pictures onto a CD & was able to reload them. My wife did loose a few documents she had worked on. I will be backing this pup up from now on. I understand that sometimes HDs fail, I've just never had it happen to me before either at home or work & this one failed at the absolute wrong time. I'm actually glad to have it back, as I said above, we had been happy with it before.

All the raving reviews are really true - it is a very well-built and fabulously running system.  Bright LCD, great backlit keyboard, very good battery life and MacOS is fast and snappy.  I have installed Windows 7, using Bootcamp, and it also runs very well.  Mine did not come with Snow Leopard so I had to download a 23-Mb update from Apple to get the drivers \"right\" in Windows 7.  But, caveat emptor, I assumed this MB would be equally nice as the one I bought late last year (from Amazon) for my oldest daughter.  After I brought this one home, I discovered a rub mark (not bad - but noticeable) and a long but small scratch on the aluminum lid.  I will put a nice laptop skin on it to cover both - but an $1100+ system should not have damage like this.  So - if you don't want any scratches/etc - buy from Amazon!  If you buy from a brick and mortar - I suggest that you open the package in the store and check for visible damage.", "Date": "November 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "No spinning ball", "Author": "R. H.

Not the current model but it doesn't really matter.", "Author": "GD from ND", "ReviewID": "R2QH5BGLU4DMTW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In a nutshell, I love this little white MacBook. I bought it in Jan '09 and upgraded the memory to 2G (just for fun) and later upgraded to Snow Leopard (again just for fun).The Mac OS has performed flawlessly and so has the computer. The \"blue screen of death\" situation just doesn't occur. When a 3rd party program occasionally gets tangled up in itself it either closes down and you return to your desktop or if it hangs you can do a \"Force Quit\" and it quits. Simply an amazing feature of an operating system.I have used MS operating systems since 1986, prior to that a TRS Color Computer.  DOS always seemed stabile but starting with Windows 3 all that changed then along came Win 95, Win 98, Win ME and finally XP. I realized that for one reason or another I was having to do a hard system restore 3 to 5 times a year and that had been going on for a very long time. For a long time I thought maybe it was because of something I had done wrong but finally realized it wasn't me. I finally grew tired of Windows instability and vulnerability while on the internet and started experimenting with Linux.Linux is cool but after trying some 15 - 20 different flavors of it and not finding any of them fully compatible with my old Dell laptop (and not being geeky enough to figure out how to make everything work) I gave up on Linux and made the transition to Mac and have absolutely no regrets. Everything works so smoothly together and with the OS and hardware designed hand in hand why wouldn't it?I used Boot Camp to install a OEM copy of XP in a small partition of my hard drive and about the only reason I maintain that is so I can run an old version of Flight Sim once in a while. I have no other need for Windows. I'm not a gamer and my computing needs are pretty much met with iWork and my camera's software.Buy the Mac, you'll love it.

Ive got the black one which in my opinion is better than the white one (white one sometimes get yellowish) and although the black one does get some smudges as everyone says, they are minor, really, they will not make it look worse. IT IS THE NICEST AND BEST COMPUTER EVER MADE!! and now at a really good price (I paid $1499 for it). It is even nicer than the new one!! The new one has really good features so you might be opting for that one, but please buy a MAC. It is, really, the BEST OPERATING SYSTEM EVER!! It is easy, fast and you will like it (if you are thinking you might not i assure you that you will). There is nothing out there that can compete with the mac operating system.This computer is great for everything. If you are a heavy gamer I don't recommend it, but if you are not buy it or buy any mac out there!!MACS ARE THE BEST!!

This is my first Mac and have been using Windows products for over 15 years.  I have not had any major issues with Windows, but I needed a change because of some issues I was having with my Sony Vaio.  The Vaio had Vista on it so it was a memory vampire but I figured when I upgraded its memory, I thought it would fix the issue.  I still had problems with running my photoediting programs and internet.  I knew I needed a switch and after looking at all the things I need a laptop for (word documents, music creation, photography, etc.).Do I think everyone needs to chuck their Windows computers out the Window (see my joke, I am a funny guy) to go and purchase a $1000 laptop? Definitely not!!!!  Do I think that if you use the laptop for the same things as me that you should consider purchasing one?  Yes!  I do love the quick speed with my Photoshop Elements and Garageband is amazing because I don't need to go and shell out lots of money for recording equipment,With this ongoing battle between Mac and Windows users, I say forget who makes one and look at what your going to truly being using the computer for and make your decisions from there.Hope this helps!", "Date": "November 11, 2009"},
