{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good build and speed", "Author": "ELSC", "ReviewID": "R2JKA25IL60A4R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I agree with other reviewers regarding Amazon.com's misleading product description that this laptop comes equipped with a bluray drive. Since the complaints they have removed that description. Before buying I researched and had discussions with other members (in the discussion threads) about the config of the laptop. We confirmed that there was no bluray and I decided that for the price I am willing to purchase it. The key factors were the intel core i3 cpu and samsung's reputation of quality.After using it for 2 days ... I can testify that for the price ($560) it was worth the money. It is fast and build quality is very good. The machine looks classy with its glossy exterior in platinum finish and the hand rest is also of the same color and material. I had Lenovo, Fujitsu, Compaq, Acer and Sony before and the Samsung is close to the Sony in terms of quality build. The performance of the i3 is also pretty adequate for my use. The Compaq and Acer are far from the build quality of this laptop.There is hardly any bloatware installed except for some trial games, Samsung's own system mgt software, trial Mcafee. I have since removed most of it. My Sony came with tons of bloatware.It is also pretty light to lug around. Screen is also sharp and clear and comes with it's calibration tool just like a TV. Keyboard has separate number keys which is pretty useful for numerical data entry. There is also an HDMI output port which is useful if you want to hook it up to a HDTV for watching DVDs. Very silent unlike some laptops where you can hear the cooling fan. The main reason why I chose to go intel vs amd was the overheating issues with some of the amd series of cpus. This one generates practically no discernible heat (I leave it on for almost 12 hours a day).Well, will recommend Samsung laptops from now on.", "Date": "December 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Samsung Laptop", "Author": "Gordon R.

A lot of brands had poor reviews on quality and customer service, but Samsung did not. The only negative comment I found on the model we got was that it had a short battery life. It's true. From my experience with other laptops, if you are worried about that, get the 9 cell battery.  This item is a great unit for this price range, and I would highly recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "December 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not too bad...", "Author": "Deceiver", "ReviewID": "R1B7GQW373G75T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for a good notebook with a good price.

However i must say this machine is not as impressive as it seems. The screen looks great, however the build just feels the same as most computers out there, cheap. I love Acers but had one i gave to my dad because i needed more processing power, it had just a regular Pentium dual core and i wanted the I3 or i5. The Acer had a much better looking screen, it was a 17.3 and much brighter. The built quality is much the same, this one actually feels a little cheaper. The Silver Metal look is really deceiving, when you pick it up it's actually a little to light to the point of feeling, generic.The speed is good, but i owned a Lenevo that was the same layout basically and a little quicker(it seems). Also the Lenevo build felt much sturdier. The keyboard takes some getting use to, after using a bigger laptop. I still prefer the Acer for this very reason. I did some video converting and this was about 10 to 15 mintues faster, so that's a big plus. Also the audio is very good. I'm really not complaining, but it's just not as exciting as i had hoped. Basically it looks cool, but feels very breakable. Time will tell i suppose, if i decide to keep it. :)NOTE:Finger prints are easily seen on the black around the keys. And the mouse button.
