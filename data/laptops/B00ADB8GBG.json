The computer has Beat audio speakers so the sound on this is amazing. It sounds amazingly crisp,clear and can sound extremely louder than the MacBook. The top part of the laptop is made out of aluminum but the bottom is made out of tough heavy duty plastic which is great because it allows the computer to be lighter than if it was completely aluminum. Overall, I'm extremely happy.", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great computer", "Author": "Cathy Sheppard", "ReviewID": "R37XUWR5P1PCLX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop was purchased for my grandson who is serving in the US Air Force. He wanted a computer that he could play games on and yet still be very mobile. In talking with him before writing this review he stated that he is extremely pleased with the performance of this device. He says that it is very fast (when internet signal allows), it has a very good graphics card and he is very satisfied with this laptop. The item was shipped directly to his base and was received in excellent condition. Because of my Prime account he received it in two days. The price was very reasonable which was a very big plus for someone on his salary. He would recommend this to others.", "Date": "March 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop", "Author": "krh316 \"krh316\"", "ReviewID": "R2A47EE53ESYT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have had quite a few HP computers over the years and they have proved to be very reliable. Love this Laptop. Runs very cool (Temperature That Is). Had this Laptop on a good part of the day and no noticeable heat build at all. Screen graphics very good. Side viewing is not that great. You pretty much need to be pretty much centered in front of it. That's not much of a negative at all considering all the other good qualities of the Laptop. Sound quality is very good for a laptop. Very pleased with this laptop.", "Date": "March 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Up and down arrows", "Author": "Diego Barriga Mendez", "ReviewID": "R327F5FPMNUG0P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Up and down arrows a bit small but otherwise excellent.
