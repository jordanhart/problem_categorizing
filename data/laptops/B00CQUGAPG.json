Had to get use to Windows 8 but this didn't take too long. Just got the update to Windows 8.1 and I like it. The laptop is just what we were looking for small enough to be easily transported yet has the optical drive and large hard drive. It replaced my old e-machine celeron 900 laptop so to me it is super fast. Battery life is good somewhere between 4-5 hours. Feels well built. I would buy it again.

It's a decent machine but it seems something is wonky with the wireless connectivity.  It's dropped signal twice already, and would not reconnect without restarting.  Not good. And it's not the wireless connection itself because 2nd laptop, cell phone, and nook stayed connected to wifi throughout. The keyboard isn't backlit, which I didn't think would be a dealbreaker but is turning out to be way more inconvenient than I anticipated. The keys are spaced farther apart than I'm used to, coming from a Lenovo Thinkpad, but it seems most of the new laptops have this weird spacing. If it continues to drop wifi connection it's definitely going back.", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dell is not the Company they once were.  Quality is no more....", "Author": "C. Rendon", "ReviewID": "RJW0K8G8H8CNK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am sad to report that after only 4 months my hard drive went out.  I have also had issues with the operating system which would not take the 8.1 upgrade, as well as the blue screen of death.  It has been out for repair under warranty once, and less than a week back home it needs to go back for repair again.  I have spent hours on the phone with Dell troubleshooting, running their tests, etc., as well as my own troubleshooting, and hours reloading my software twice now.  Now with it having to go back, I would have to reload my software again a third time.  I told Dell no.  I am fighting with them to buy this lemon back.  I do not have the time to waste hours of my time and go without my computer repeatedly. Additionally, I have lost faith in the longevity of this computer.  I honestly believe it will not last 2-3 years, perhaps not even a year.  My last Dell lasted over 6-7 years, without one problem!  I never spent hours troubleshooting in all those years.  In just the four months I have owned this lemon, I have spent lost hours and much stress tied to the phone.Dell has passed me around to various departments and managers, telling me they will not offer a refund or replacement. Just my warranty.  I will not tolerate this, as I purchased a new computer, and expect the quality and reliability of a new computer.  I did not get this.  I could have purchased a used laptop and saved hundreds of dollars and had less problems, perhaps no problems.  This computer is not even of refurbished quality, because a refurbished machine is operating without continuing problems.I have done extensive research and have found others complaining about Dell in the last year.  Many of which are like me, former Dell owners with previous reliable machines.  It is apparent that Dell's computers have declined in quality and workmanship.  And the customer service is built around defending the Company to save a dime, rather than owning up to a defective machine, and sending the customer a new replacement after multiple issues.  They would rather put out a customer of their computer repeatedly (1 to 2 weeks in repair), having them on the phone for up to 1 hour to 1.5 hours at a time or more, each and every time.  And each issue generally takes multiple phone calls.  And the customer service representatives are of foreign descent, and extremely difficult to understand, making the situation that much more frustrating.So if you are considering a Dell because you once had a quality Dell machine like myself and many others, do your research so you are not disappointed when you learn first hand it is not the same Company/quality as before.I personally will be taking this matter to small claims court, bringing Dell to my own county.  I will not allow myself sold an inferior product and then the manufacturer refusing to take responsibility and do the right thing.  My time is valuable, and if you value yours, do your research before considering Dell.  They simply are not the Company they used to be, and you will find many articles online of people with lemons like this discussing this very topic.", "Date": "March 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Dell laptop computer", "Author": "Robert Woods", "ReviewID": "R37AT4AF257ZOR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This item was purchased as a gift and the user is very pleased with the computer.
