I'm not much of a gamer, but Fallout 3, Mass Effect (1 and 2), Borderlands, and Amnesia are all working well!*Edit*Had it for a month now and it's still great!

Well solid built computer. So I gave another Dell a try!  I couldn't believe this price for what you get!  It's fast!  It's light... (really light).

I could have had a 2.5 gz processor on another model, but for way more money... I didn't think the .1gz difference in processor speed would make much difference. Also no bloatware, just basic software.  Dell Stage I don't use right now, but won't delete it.  Maybe I will use it later. You can tell this is solid built as well!  Glad I chose Dell again, that's for sure...  And you know Dell has great customer support too.  The finish on this thing is really nice, smooth, shiny.

One guy bought it in Venezuela, another complains about a different Dell model \"that looks like this one.\"  This is my second 15N-2728bk that I bought this month.  I needed two but decided to buy them one at a time to make sure that it was a good system.  I paid 429 each and it was truly worth it.  A great little machine that I use for my Real Estate business.  I have been using them a lot and get about 4+ hours on a charge.  Two negatives are:  I attached a mouse because the pad is overly sensitive; and, when I load a DVD I support the open drawer with one hand so as not to exert too much pressure on the very light-weight dvd drawer (and that is just common sense).  The 6gb memory for this price is terrific.

We have owned 3 Dell laptops in the past 12 years and think highly of the brand because the company stands behind its products. This computer, however, is by far the flimsiest laptop I've even handled. I was worried that the thin plastic case would not be sturdy for even the most careful of 10 year olds but so far it has not been an issue.The most pressing concern with this laptop has been its workmanship. Out of the box, we plugged in the battery adapter cord and noticed the receptacle on the rear of the unit wiggled. When we turned on the laptop, the battery icon on the screen toggled indiscriminately between charging and running on battery - not a good sign for a new computer. I called Dell, they advised me to ship it back to Amazon and get a replacement, otherwise Dell would have to replace the motherboard.The return process through Amazon was easy enough, and we received a brand new laptop in about 4 days. While the battery plug is no longer a problem, I noticed however that the batter adapter itself was a different model than what was sent with the original laptop. Perhaps they are interchangeable but it still seemed odd.Beyond the structural concerns, so far the computer itself seems to work well for our purposes, and the cost was very reasonable.", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Bret Grof", "ReviewID": "RNR791K52GWL6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great laptop so far.

There was no other bloatware crap included. Nice. The battery holds power and seems to last as long as the advertised duration on a new laptop. All of the ports are in working condition, and the diagnostics that I ran indicate that there are no other problems.For the price that I paid, I was able to upgrade the HDD to a faster Seagate Momentus XT hybrid as well as add 8GB of RAM. I put the new HDD into an external carrier and downloaded the Seagate DiskWizard from Seagate to clone the original HDD to the new HDD with no problems and replaced the old HDD with the new HDD.

When I received it, it was nearly in brand new condition. I couldn't even tell that it was previously used, and I'm a techy. the keyboard is very nice, it has specious keys and feels pretty durable. The mouse pad is also nice. Many people complain about mouse pads in a variety of lower end laptops saying that they randomly give out momentarily. The only problem I've had with this mouse-pad is that it's very close to the keyboard. I find myself constantly touching the mouse-pad while I'm typing.Everything I've thrown at it so far runs pretty smooth, and it is overall a pretty awesome laptop.For those 1 star ratings, mostly all of them are the buyers fault complained about something stupid that had nothing to do with the actual product. The screen is great from many viewing angles, the wifi works fine, the durability is fine, and everything runs fast.The only two things I'm going to complain about is the mouse-pad and the OS. The OS has nothing to do with the product, though, but moreso along the lines of the seller (Amazon Warehouse).While normal typists rests their hands on asdf jkl;, the bottom of the thumbs rest right over the corner of the mouse-pad, so I've noticed that I'm constantly tapping the mouse-pad and having to rewrite a few things, so it's not very convenient even though it works very well.If you ARE going to purchase this laptop from Amazon Warehouse (because they're selling it for roughly $270), your Windows 7 may not be installed genuinely. In other words, Windows will read the OS as a fraudulent Windows version and you won't be able to receive a few Windows benefits. There is an easy way to fix this, though.1) Go to utorrent.com and download utorrent.2) Go to: [...] to install a Windows 7 activator which will make your copy of Windows genuine.One last thing I'd like to point out is that my version of Windows did not come loaded down with Dells software. Many people were complaining about it. Also, if your wifi, usb, SD card reader, or any driver on your computer isn't working, the computer comes with a driver installation CD so you can re-install any drivers that aren't working.EDIT:2 WEEKS OF USE: Laptop remains flawless. Even though many people have complained about the durability of the laptop, it's really not as flimsy as people make it out to be. It's not made of steel, but it's still very durable. Everything is still running very well and very fast. Able to play mid-level games on medium detailed graphics without lag. I've had several word documents up with about 15 tabs in my browser open simultaneously and everything processed just as fast as if I was only running one tab or one document. To control the issue I was having with the keyboard, how the mouse-pad is right under it and it's very hard to avoid tapping it when you're typing, I downloaded some free software that prevents clicks from being made when you're typing. So far in two weeks it says I've had 322 clicks prevented, so it definitely helps. For $270 nearly brand new from Amazon Warehouse, this laptop can safely hold the title as the fastest laptop I've ever owned.", "Date": "April 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "great Laptop.", "Author": "Dennis M.
