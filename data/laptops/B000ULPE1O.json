I wasn't too sure about having Vista, but after using it I do like it.  I use this notebook at home and the PC I use at work has XP.  I like Vista better than XP.  The biggest problem I had with Vista is that I could no longer use my very old inkjet printer.  I checked the printer manufacturer's website for a Vista driver and it was not providing a driver for that printer.  I can print from Vista with my somewhat newer laser printer.  I would suggest that before buying any computer with Vista, it would be wise to be sure your printer will run with Vista.The speed of this notebook is excellent.  My husband decided to double the RAM and it is now beyond excellent.This computer is great.  I need to explore more of it to find out everything it can do, but it has more than met my needs so far.  I would highly recommend this computer.In response to another review, I have not had ANY of the problems mentioned.  In fact, when we replaced computers at work a few months ago, I insisted on a Toshiba notebook for me (however it wasn't this particular model).  I do not hesitate to recommend Toshiba.", "Date": "December 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great all-around computer.", "Author": "M.

After you have used it for a while you will know what I'm talking about. The speed for the amount of memory amazed me. My roommate has a laptop with 3GB Ram and it is no faster. She was upset because she paid more and has better stats but my laptop is better. Her DVD drive also went out after 6 months of use. This Toshiba is quality. I have never had a problem with it and even though its a little older it runs like new. Decent screen display for a older computer but still not what you will get on a new $800 dollar laptop. Sound quality is decent and gets pretty loud. It just feels sturdy when you use it. It stays much cooler than most laptops under heavy use as well which may have a lot to do with its longevity. I think for the money you couldn't ask for more. If you are looking for a good day to day laptop look no further.", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great laptop", "Author": "B. Loomis", "ReviewID": "R1LDN4IEBR5OLH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my Toshiba satellite A135 S4527 in April 2007, its worked great for me almost 3 years now.  No problems at all to report, except that Vista sucks compared to XP.  But, that isn't Toshiba's fault and I could always buy XP to replace it.  The laptop was a good deal at the time, I paid $599 I think and have no regrets about it.  One of my better purchases, I might stick to Toshiba since I had a good experience with this one.  A friend of mine has a really high-end Toshiba and its also 3 years old, and very nice, lots of extra stuff on it.", "Date": "March 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great price, basic computer, very satisfied", "Author": "H. Erickson-Sander \"Heather\"", "ReviewID": "R2OLTQYXE1DB6L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this notebook several months ago and I've had a great experience with it. I've had zero problems with it, and I'm very pleased with Vista as well. The one thing I would change about it is that mine takes it's sweet time booting up when I turn it on. Once it's all ready to go, however, it runs very fast. I'm sure that's something I could help by changing some settings, but it's the only negative thing I have to say about this computer. I have The Sims 2 Deluxe on here, and am very pleased with how fast the game runs on this notebook. I've had absolutely no problems with the computer handling any software I've added.We got it for a great price! And if you just need a basic, good computer, this is a good one to go with. It would be especially good for a student.", "Date": "June 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Not bad, the old girl still has some serious power", "Author": "Sam I Am", "ReviewID": "R2M0934KGQ14SG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This laptop really needs 2 GB of RAM if you're expecting to get the best performance out of Windows Vista. Be prepared to do an upgrade (this is very easy, even for the non-techie).  Also, the A135 tends to run very hot - so I recommend purchasing an external USB fan, like this one.Targus AWE81US Chill Hub and Chill Mat with 4-port Hub for Laptops up to 17-Inch - BlackMy assumption is that you'll end up with one of these computers the same way I did - either someone will give you one, or you'll find it dirt-cheap on CL or the auction website that starts with the letter \"e.\" Brand-new laptops can be purchased so cheaply these days that there's no serious reason to buy a Toshiba Satellite A135 and pay $200 for it, but if you stumble upon one for less than $100, it's probably worth buying, if you're looking for a light-duty laptop for grandma or very young kids who don't need the latest and greatest.Also, a fairly common problem, judging by comments/pleas for help posted on various internet message boards, is that many of these laptops bought used have a glitch regarding the bios being locked with a password. There's a complex fix, which is way beyond my skill level, involving a soldering iron and a paper clip. I just decided to live with the locked bios, meaning I can't get into the CMOS settings to change anything, which shouldn't be a massively big deal for most users.Edited, to note, FWIW, I performed a completely unremarkable memory upgrade to 2GB, but the introduction of a used 160 GB hard drive into the belly of the beast killed the lazy old b**ch. Even though the hard drive specs indicated it was a perfect match, something went wrong, and the patient died belly open on the operating table. I removed the new hard drive and reinserted the original one, and all of a sudden, there were bizarre error messages about a network card failure.Pfft. Cracking open the slots on the bottom of the case revealed a solder knocked loose, from what looks like the network card, which was most likely caused by the age of the laptop. A real FUBAR. I could buy a soldering iron and teach myself how to repair the damaged connection, but at the rate I'm going, I might end up burning the house down.

I didn't want to believe that a Toshiba Notebook could be so bad, but it seems that the joyous reverie of other reviewers (I wish them well) is not universally echoed by owners everywhere. People are having awful problems with it shutting off spontaneously and then perversely not being able to shut it once it is running.  The Hitachi SATA hard drive dies on some owners. USB isn't working right for others.  Toshiba is uncooperative, the drivers for XP are darned hard to find, Vista crashes, on and on and on.  I can't vouch for all of these problems, maybe they're operator error or sunspots or alien abductions.  All I know is that mine is going back in the packaging and off to a service depot for a long rest, hopefully for the cure of two show-stopping problems (aforementioned dead disk after 4 months, and chronic shut down problems going back to since new).Bon Voyage. l'il notebook. we hardly knew ye.Caveat emptor.", "Date": "January 16, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "15.4 \" Notebook Computer Bundle with WXGA LCD Display and 1280 x 800 Pixel Resolution\nLoaded with Windows Vista Home Premium, 120 GB Hard Drive Capacity , Serial ATA Hard Drive Interface and 1 GB SDRAM, DDR2 Memory\n1.73 Ghz Intel Pentium Dual-Core T2080 Processor with Super-Multi DVD+/-RW Optical Drive Optical Drive\nMicrophone Jack, Headphone Jack, Mini USB 2.0 Port, S-Video Out, Serial Port, 4.0 USB Ports\n802.11b/g Wireless Connectivity , 10/100 Ethernet LAN Network Card , 56KB Modem", "Name": "Toshiba Satellite Notebook Computer A135-S4527", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mkJVEJJYL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000ULPE1O"}}
