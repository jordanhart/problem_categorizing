Windows 8: Not So Much", "Author": "Tina Martinez", "ReviewID": "R3R9WZQ6KQJSE6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received my Asus Vivobook yesterday and spent several hours with it over the course of the evening getting to know it. It's my first new (vs. new-to-me) laptop, so these are fresh eyes when it comes to un-boxing a laptop.First Impressions:* This is a solid, yet lightweight, piece of machinery. It's quite thin, due to the lack of optical drive and the modern battery. My HP laptops in the past seem like heavy blocks in comparison.* The brushed metal case has a subtle and classy appeal. Picking the Asus up with one hand is no issue at all, even with chronic pain issues. I can't see any issue carrying it in a laptop case without putting too much strain on your shoulder.* The power cord comes with a \"block\" type plug. Think the way iPhones used to come, but much larger. It seemed rather odd to me, but I don't know enough about the technology to speak about it one way or the other.Powering Up:* I let the unit charge for a little while before turning it on (via wall power) and it started up quickly. The setup process with MS Windows 8 took a while to initialize, but after that it responded lightning fast every time I opened up from hibernation mode. The laptop operates quietly.* The keys are of the flatter, \"chiclet\" style, and I find them somewhat annoying to type with as a woman with longer nails. Still, I got used to it fairly quickly.* The touch-screen is incredibly responsive. Unlike the lag I sometimes get with my iPad, the Asus screen obeyed my slightest (and I do mean the lightest) of touches. I also love how vibrant and glossy the screen is, without overly showing smudges.* Sound quality with headphones and without was gorgeous!Windows 8 OS:My only gripe with the laptop is the operating system. Windows 8, if you've never used it before, seemed to me to be awkward, redundant, biased against non-Microsoft (I.e. Google) apps, and I forsee using it almost exclusively in desk-top mode. The tile based app screen would be fine, if it weren't full of junk apps you have to remove (customize) and didn't force you to search for hidden menus so you can explore and customize your settings. I spent an hour trying to recover my password for my defunct hotmail account so I could set up my MS profile with my current information. Over and over it asked me for codes to verify I was who I was, until I finally shut off that requirement. What a pain in the... well, you get my drift.Final Thoughts:I'm pretty sure it's the touch-screen that drives the cost up on this model. Reaching up to use the touch screen seems counter intuitive to me since you've got a keyboard right there. It's nice, but feels gimmicky for me. If they have a similar model for less without it, I'd go that route, especially on a budget. If you're already accustomed to Windows 8 you'll likely dive right in, but for those who aren't, keep in mind that it'll be a bit of a tech-culture shock. As a laptop, in MS desktop mode, the laptop is a little gem that packs a lot of elegance and power into a pretty package.I'll be updating with battery life observations and further issues/likes as I come across them.UPDATE - BATTERY 5-29-14: Battery life of five hours is entirely accurate. My experience in draining it with solid use has been the same each time, five hours. Also, this unit charges very quickly.UPDATE - FAN 5-29-14: It's so quiet that I honestly can't notice the fan at all unless the room is entirely silent. That's one quiet laptop!UPDATE - TRACK PAD 5-29-14: I have been experiencing difficulty with the track pad in tap-clicking on items I'd like to open or select. Sometimes I can just use my finger to tap-click on items, but more often than not it's forcing me to use the very loud manual key at the bottom of the track pad. When using a program or game where frequent selection actions are required it's quite annoying. Not sure what that's all about, but I'll be contacting customer support about it.", "Date": "May 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "VivoBook Laptop", "Author": "Vicki Bohn", "ReviewID": "R2138TN00SQ5K4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm just your average computer user.  I am no expert, but use a computer daily in my home for the basics like web browsing, watching Netflix, creating word processor or spreadsheet documents, uploading pictures, etc.  I've been using this laptop for several weeks now and here are some of my thoughts:Pros-Slim and not too heavy at 4 lbs.-Attractive-The HD Screen looks good-The speakers are good and get loud enough to be able to hear well.  The speakers on our Toshiba laptop from 4 years ago only get barely loud enough to hear.  Forget watching Netflix on that one without headphones or external speakers.  No such trouble here!-Having a touchscreen on a laptop makes navigating the screen so much faster and easier.  No wireless mouse needed.  No more awkward movements on the touch mouse pad thing.Cons- I'm not a fan of WIndows 8.  This was my first time using it and it took a little getting used to, but I've figured it out enough to be able to use the laptop.- I'm an iPod Touch, iPad, iPhone user and this is the first time I've used a touchscreen on another device, so my brain is always wanting to get this touchscreen to respond to apple prompts, but the cues are a little different on this touchscreen.  Again, it took a little getting used to.- Sometimes on websites I've noticed that certain features don't want to respond to the touchscreen, but they respond just fine with the mouse pad...I don't know what it's called...mouse pad sounds good to me...haha- Call me old school, but I am kind of missing the dvd drive.  Yeah, I'm just old school that way.", "Date": "June 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Beautiful, Small, Light", "Author": "Dat Hong", "ReviewID": "RM8JZY96R3WJE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a very beautiful and functional laptop made by Asus (pronounced A-Seuss).  The laptop is less than an inch thick from the thickest part and contains no disc drive.  The weight is about 4 pounds.You get a large amount of space at 750GB (5400 RPM) and free Asus 5GB cloud storage.  Asus also has a 1 year warranty that covers accidental drops, spills, power surges and fire damage (valued at $99).  You also get a 30 day zero bright dot guarantee.The laptop advertises it can wake up from sleep mode in 2 seconds, and I can attest that to be true.  It wakes up very fast and you are able to hop back on instantly.  It also says it provides 14 days of stand by time, but when I tested it, it did not last more than a week.  All my tests have been done on the default settings of the laptop with no changes, besides signing onto my wifi.When you first get the laptop, it must be charged or plugged in in order to use it.  The battery did not come charged.  The plug is different than most of the ones I am used to, and is designed like an iPhone charger.  It is quite huge, almost the size of an Apple TV.  If you have tight space behind a couch or table, you will not be able to plug this charger in.The display is quite beautiful and if you are not used to sharp screens, it is very vibrant and clear.  Everything pops out at you.  However, I use a Dell Ultra sharp monitor daily for work and casually surf on an iPad Air so I was not too impressed with the quality of the screen.  It did not look as sharp as those I mentioned.  However, when I put it up next to my old Dell Inspirion 9300 and normal Dell monitor, you can see how much better it is.  It will depend on what you are used to.Netflix movies looked and sounded great on it.  You can also connect it via HDMI so you can watch and surf on the big screen.  The speakers are pretty loud and I am quite satisfied with the sound.The touch screen is very responsive and everything I touched did what I expected it to do.  However, the laptop screen DOES NOT fold back.  You can not carry this around as a tablet.  I do like touch screens and everything should be touch, however, when you have a keyboard and mouse in front of you, there seems to be no need to touch the screen.  The only use I had for the touch was to do some of the quirky things Windows 8 allows you to do, like swipe screens and multitask screens.  However, for normal use, I never use the touch screen for anything else.It is very quiet and I could barely hear a fan.  It stays pretty cool to the touch, but not tablet cool.  The finish is Brushed Aluminum and does leave finger prints.  I can see it easily getting scratched.  It is beautiful looking though.It's great as a casual laptop and priced very competitively.  If you need a laptop for work, or casual surfing, I would highly recommend this one.", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Exactly What I Expected", "Author": "aOrtega", "ReviewID": "R292ISPF8KMU57", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything it promises to be, even the graphics card is decent!
