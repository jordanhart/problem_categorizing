Brown \"Cheezy Gordita Crunch\"", "ReviewID": "R25NUGWJD0C7YW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a laptop that was extremely portable with a reliable battery, and this laptop is that. It's also pretty darn powerful, I don't run games or anything, but I'm sure it would work fine. The bluetooth has a good range and the wifi as well. The HP fingerprint reader is very responsive, the screen is nice and crisp. Windows 7 is really great too, I'm coming from XP, never wanted anything to do with vista. I prefer 7 to XP honestly, which surprised me, I've been pretty hardcore for a long time. Using the internet and typing word documents while using bluetooth headphones and wifi, the battery will give me 4-5 hours of life. If you adjust the power settings you could probably get a little bit more. The bottom is plastic but the top and inside are aluminum and the etching doesn't look too bad in person either. The built-in speakers are okay, not great but that's the usual I think. The keyboard is easy to type on, I'm coming from a Microsoft 4000 ergo-keyboard, so it's different but it's pretty nice and responsive. Not sticky or anything. The touchpad is good but kind of annoying, the mouse will jump around if you bump it with your palm or whatever, it's not terrible and I don't mind, someone with HUGE hands would probably hate it though. The HDMI port is convenient but beware, there is a good chance the resolution on your LCD/LED/Plasma tv will have different resolutions and so it will either be zoomed in a bit too close, or have a black bar around the entire image. It runs very quietly, doesn't get too warm, and is ultimately pretty good for the money.I'm just going randomly as I think about what I like about it, that's why it's so sporadic and random. Just go to your local bestbuy, like I did, and see if you like it, then buy this one because it's A. cheaper and B. has more features. Bestbuy keeps a different one in stock but it's the same keys, shell, screen. Just missing a few features.", "Date": "September 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love at first sight!", "Author": "Joel Moreno \"Jo Black\"", "ReviewID": "R24YCSOTGGP1OP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is awesome! I just felt in love the first time I saw it. Fast, beautiful design, ultraportable, lightweight... I've been using it for a couple of days and I'm more the satisfied with this purchase. Amazon had the lowest price on the market and provided me a very good service and very fast shipping. This laptop is a winner! 5 stars!", "Date": "September 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good quality laptop", "Author": "Tom", "ReviewID": "R2802G11YHV5I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good quality laptop especially for someone who is looking to upgrade.  With 4GB of RAM which can be upgraded to 8GB for those of you who want more power.  500GB hard drive, which might be a bit excessive for some who do not need that much.  It does its job fast and well whether it be transferring files or running videos. I really love how lightweight it is for a 14\" screen at only 4.4lbs.  Being lightweight makes it easy to lay on your lap or to throw it in a backpack and walk around with. A few gripes would be a bit pricey especially with no Blue-Ray player.  The mouse-pad doesn't have its scrolling side bar on it anymore to scroll pages up and down.  Instead you have to use two fingers which are a bit touchy.  Last would have to be the keyboard itself.  I have always bought HP laptops so far and have always liked how smoothly my fingers flowed when typing.  But for this computer I'm not a fan.  The setup is nice for my fingers to lay but when typing it feels like I have to press just a bit harder to have the computer recognize the key.  Which sometimes causes mistakes and for me to slow down.  Other than that I recommend this laptop for someone looking to upgrade to a fast, sleek, lightweight computer.  As a side note: HP puts a bunch of crap on their computers that most users do not use at all.  So I highly recommend [...].  It's just something that basically gets rid of all of the ridiculous software and other programs that HP installs that slows up your computer and you really do not need.", "Date": "August 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fingerprint Reader Breaks after 1 year", "Author": "Wellbridge", "ReviewID": "R3UT4UFW6MTAY5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My fingerprint reader broke one week after the 1 year warranty expired.

It got so bad that they eventually fell apart completely, just from opening and closing the laptop. The left edge of the screen started to warp badly with only a couple years of use. The fans were really noisy and the left side would get super hot after extended periods of time.Cheaply made and unreliable. I wasn't too impressed with graphics processing either. There are plenty of pcs in this price range that could outperform it. Get yourself something of better quality that will last you more than 1-2 years.", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great laptop with a few flaws", "Author": "S. Opara", "ReviewID": "R24V9H1WHY54SD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got a good deal on this around 500 and something dollars. It is pretty light and this is a good thing because I carry a lot of books around. The screen is great at 14\" and it contributes to the overall portability of the laptop. At the highest brightness, it is almost blinding (which is a good thing). lol. I LOVE the keyboard but the mouse is a whole different story. The click buttons are a bit loud especially when you're in a quiet place like a library. The trackpad can be random sometimes. There are certain gestures that zoom in and out of pages. I am unaware of these gestures and because of that, accidentally placing two fingers on the pad can cause pages to zoom out or scroll to the bottom. It doesn't happen too often but happens enough times for me to notice and can be a pain sometimes. You get to live with it though.Battery life is really great in the first few months. About 4-6 hours depending on usage. Over time it drops to about 2 hours on a single charge. I guess this is normal with most laptops. The one thing I really like about this laptop is the fingerprint reader. You can customize to open certain programs with the swipe of a finger. For example, when I swipe my index finger, it opens up my browser. My middle finger opens up word processor and so on and so forth. I also use the reader to unlock and lock my laptop. Might be a gimmick for some but I find it really useful and cool.Only giving it a 3 out of 5 due to the so-so battery life and trackpad. Other wise a great buy if you can get a good deal on it.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sufficiently powerful processor; otherwise a bust", "Author": "Melissa Shlakman", "ReviewID": "R3IOH90AMDMITM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got a good deal on this, around $500. But you get what you pay for. Laptop multitasks well and in general is pretty speedy. Also light and fairly thin. But the problems far outweigh the benefits:- Integrated mic stopped working, while under warranty. But HP would only fix it if I agreed to let them wipe my hard drive. The fact that it's clearly a hardware issue, not involving software, didn't sway them. So I got a cheap external mic which suffices for Skype and basic sound pickup.- Keyboard not responsive, many keys need to be pressed twice if I fail to pound them. I only use this with an external keyboard;- Sound card - only supports 2.1 external speakers - didn't see that among the tech specs. Internal speakers can't come close to providing decent sound for anything but basic notifications. Music? Forget it;- Touch pad just slightly more responsive than keyboard. I use a wireless mouse unless absolutely necessary to use the pad.The biggest disappointment was HP's support decision, requiring me to be without my computer for 10 business days (I could pay a fee to expedite that down to 6 business days) and wipe the hard drive including all settings, personalization, etc. Too bad.

It is light (4.4 lbs), it is fast (i5 processor, decent RAM), it has decent hard drive (500 GB). Lots other features such as integrated webcam of decent quality, etc. etc. It has killer looks. It worked great for some time...Then, problems occurred:1. Its screen developed an internal crack. So, I bought a replacement and installed it. Thanks to the good Samaritans who posted the instructions to replace the screen. Warning, it is a little intricate process, and you will end up scratching the aluminum body of the laptop.2. Now, one of its hinges has become detached from the lid.And I use this very lightly at home, primarily as a desktop replacement.

Anyway, I haven't had many problems; when I did have a BIOS issue, I called Customer Service & was able to solve the problem on the first try!!! It's lightweight, and the battery life is pretty decent for a 14\" laptop (I can get around 5-5 1/2 hrs), but only if I'm NOT running a whole lot of power-consuming apps. I've had a few IE \"not responding\" issues, but that's Windows.Processor is awesome, but the speakers are lousy. I'm not a gamer -- the most I play is Jewel Quest Solitaire or something like that.  This laptop really isn't made (spec wise) for high-use gaming.  I haven't had any problems with the touchpad, though some people have. Haven't had a chance to wirelessly stream video content from this laptop to my TV, because I don't have the adapter for that.
