{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Must Read! Don't overspend on an Alienware!", "Author": "Saint04", "ReviewID": "RT3Q0SOIJ3972", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Disclaimer: This review is on the similar Asus G750JW from Best Buy. The difference between this one on Amazon and the one from best buy is the warranty and memory.-About meI am a full time grad student. I use my system for course work and entertainment. The Asus G750 meets those needs. I have given this system five star and would have given it four in a half if I could. Most of my review will compare to Alienware given that I believe they are subjectively the set standard for gaming laptops and I returned one for this Asus.-Display:The display has great viewing angles. If you check out Asus's website, they state it has a 140 degree viewing angle. The Alienware has an upgrade panel of 1080p with IPS technology. This is relevant because IPS is known for it's great viewing angles while the TN panels such as the one in the Asus aren't. However, TN panels have quicker response time and are better for gaming in my opinion. The Asus screen produces rich and Vibrant colors. Also, the TN panel in the Asus has great viewing angles countering the stereotype of poor viewing angles. While not an IPS, it will more than suffice for gaming. IPS panels are also prone to light bleed in which light from behind the panel can be seen above the screen on occasion. TN panel don't typically have this issue. My Alienware had light bleed and I could not tolerate it. Thank goodness I had this Asus as an alternative system.-Speakers/SoundThe audio is ok. The Alieware I had sounded slightly better. The speakers in this system sound slightly hollow, but the subwoofer does help offset this. I have not played around with the audio settings yet, which may help out. Also worth mentioning is that this headphone jack in this system has a built in amplifier for those gamers with huge headphones that need some serious wattage.-Fan SoundOne of my pet peeves when purchasing a laptop is the noise it may produce. I do not want to be distracted by the system, especially if I'm up late or stressed out working on a paper and find myself easily distracted. For example, I was temporarily using an HP laptop. The fan would continually spin up and idle down with no particular set speed. This was very annoying. Even while gaming, the fans remain relatively quiet. Compared to the Alienware 14 I had, this system is whisper quite given the Alienware had one fan for GPU/CPU while the Asus has two separate fans. For a powerhouse, this is one stealthily quite machine.-KeyboardI prefer the island style keyboard on the Asus for gaming since they are well differentiated and spaced while I preferred typing on the Alienware. The Alienware has a more traditional keyboard. However, while gaming, I would miss keystrokes on the Alienware, especially holding down the space bar which is required for a first person shooter I often play. The keys on the Asus are just as comfortable and more responsive during game play over the Alienware. The spacing also helps me to be more accurate while gaming than on the Alienware which as all of the keys side by side. Also worth noting is that the keyboard does not exhibit any flex. It is sturdy, comfortable, back-lit (variable brightness with white light) and comfy.-Touch-padNot much to say other than it works well. Given its large size, I do brush up on it occasionally while typing. This is rare though, but worth noting. Overall, I'm glad that two touch for right click is offered and that the touch pad is consistent and responsive. I've had poor experiences with Asus ultrabooks in the past and I'm glad to say that did not carry over to the Asus g750. The buttons are responsive and the touch-pad does feel slightly plastic. It's smooth and serves its purpose.-Ports and CD-ROMIt has an arsenal of all USB 3.0 ports (four total) with Asus's charging technology for when the system is powered off. It also has an Ethernet jack, HDMI, VGA, SD, thunderbolt, Mini-display port out,  and separate microphone and headset jacks.-PerformanceIf you are purchasing this system, it is likely because you are aware of the performance it offers. All I can do is confirm to you that this system does perform and I've had no issues regarding performance. The system has been able to handle every task I have been able to challenge it with.-WifiThis is one of the few laptops on the market to offer the new 802.11AC wifi card over the old 802.11N. It works great. However, at one point I did need to uninstall and re-install it because for some strange reason I was getting lag (ping spikes) while gaming on the 2.4ghz band. However, that didn't carry over to the 5ghz band. There was no interference with my wifi, I'm fairly confident it was a driver issue.-BatteryI can comfortably get five to six hours of battery life on optimized settings and working on papers and browsing the internet with the screen brightness up at just over 1/4th brightness. This is insane and likely the longest battery life of any full feature gaming system. While it does not offer Nvidia's Optimus tech like the Alienware, it still outlasts it in battery life. Also, it is very important to know that this system has a changeable battery, while Alienware's are sealed inside the unit and not serviceable. My 14\" Alienware had about 3.5 hours of battery life which wasn't really practical when away from the outlet. Now I have a larger system with longer battery life.-Build QualityThe system is very sturdy all around. However, went through five of these systems (yes five ! ! !) Before getting one in acceptable condition. The other system all had something wrong with the left hinge cover being broken and or detached. I went through hoops to get an acceptable unit. However, Best Buy staff was great in assisting me! ! ! I went to three different stores. The first BB I went to, I opened the computer at the desk after purchasing it so I could check it for imperfections such as DOA or dead pixels. However, I never even powered the system up. I called the BB employee over and he was surprised to see the broken hinge. He personally did the return for me. I then went to Tiger Direct and the same thing. I then went to a different Best Buy the following day since the other one I went to only had one in stock. I told the sales rep that I had already purchased two of these G750s and returned them because of broken hinges (hinge cover; one had a broken hinge that made popping sounds.) I made my purchase and opened it at the counter. Sure enough, the BB sales rep and I looked at each other and had a good laugh. He said instead of going through the return process and getting my ID flagged for excessive returns, he would just open the units and check them with me since there was something seriously wrong. He stated there must have been a bad batch of shipments. So we opened another unit/laptop and then another. Finally the third one was mint with no cosmetic defects. I powered it on, the screen looked good and I was ready to head home and game the night away. I highly recommend you have a BB associate check this computer before leaving the store so you don't end up not being able to return it because they think you broke it. Overall, the system does have a sturdy build and I like the rubbery all matte finish. One negative about the build though is that this lid does not stay shut well while in transport; very unfortunate given that the overall build looks great. I really like the beefy and sleek exhaust ports in the back.-Side Note (out of box quirks). I spent too much time on these issues and I hope this helps you solve them if they surface with you.What I like most about this system is that it can be used in clamshell configuration. This is when the lid is closed and an external monitor, keyboard and mouse are used. You can also wake the system over the USB with the keyboard or mouse while it is hibernating/sleeping. Unfortunately, I was irked to find out that the 14\" and 17\" Alienware laptops didn't work well in clamshell configuration. You have to fully power up the unit with the lid open and then you can close it up into clamshell config and use it. However, if you restart the computer or put it in standby, you have to open up the laptop again. The Asus can be left in clamshell mode at all times unless you completely power it off. The Alienware not working well in clamshell config was a deal breaker for me. Thank goodness that Asus mostly got it right. While I prefer the build of the Alienware over the Asus, Asus got the design and price points right.Musts! ! !1-Uninstall the splendid utility and re-install it. It causes horizontal lines to appear on dark backgrounds.2-increase the refresh rate using the Nvidia control panel from 60hz to 85hz. My screen seemed to blink at 60hz, which almost cause me to return it until I found a ROG forum where it was confirmed by Asus it was ok to increase the refresh rate of the screen and how to do it. There is also a youtube video on this.3-If you exhibit out of place game lag on the 2.4ghz band, un-install and re-install the wifi driver. Both the Asus and Alienware expressed this strange problem. Possibly because it's the new 802.11AC and needed updated drivers?SummaryIf you found my review helpful, please GIVE IT A THUMBS UP ! ! ! Thank you :-PI would recommend this system to anyone who's a serious or moderate gamer. It also great for the college student or average person looking for a portable gaming rig that can easily replace a powerful desktop.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Perfect Combination of Brand, Power, & Style!", "Author": "Jonicraw \"Jona\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZLKE60B0LAXL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Considering how much there is to say about this laptop, I will simply get to the point. I haven't exactly pushed the limits on this beast yet but I can surely say to everyone I know or want to inform that this machine is the 2013 portable power house. Specs are constantly getting better and better by the day and technology is exponentially growing at a cool and \"scary\" rate. Regardless, I will talk about what improvements I did to the laptop rather than how cool it is.The standard specs as given with the laptop are 1TB Seagate HD at 5400RPM (This means it is the slowest HD possible for an amazing machine)12GB DDR3 Ram 1600mhz (This is fantastic! But I am hard core technician so I need 32GB!)With the possibilities given, I took a stroll through Amazon and got these additional items:1. 2 of Corsair Vengeance 16GB (2x8GB) DDR3 1600 MHz (PC3 12800) Laptop Memory (CMSX16GX3M2A1600C10) (This allows for 32GB of Ram) = Amazon Warehouse Used Deal = $182 vs New price = $284. I got used to save $100 and no difference. It's used and returned. Big deal!2. Samsung MZ-7TD250BW 840 Series Solid State Drive (SSD) 250 GB Sata 2.5-Inch (You will want SSD power for speed and joy!) = Amazon Warehouse Used Deal = $155 vs New price = $165. Saved $10.So long story short, I managed to remove 21 screws from the bottom base of laptop (I would upload pictures I took since I had to do everything manually but Amazon disabled the option forever since July 15, 2013 because of some reason they claimed to me that \"It didn't provide the community much use\". Biggest bull I heard but regardless, took apart the base keyboard and hinges of screen, and had access to the \"Hidden 2 RAM modules\". Plugged in the new 8GB * 4 Modules, put everything back together and Boom! All set and ready to run! Installed the SSD last and I was on the way to victory!From here I was then able to copy the entire 1TB HD using EaseUs ToDo backup and apply it to the SSD. After that, I formatted the 1TB HD to NTFS with MBR because MBR is still cool and friendly to much tech still out there where the new GPT is somewhat awesome but secretly \"ugly\".I will now apply some useful data I acquired and compiled so please enjoy and make use of what I did! Yippie!\"Going Technician Mode... CMD://Hacker... [Insert] Command... Success!\"250GB SSD becomes = 232.89GB (Samsung SSD 840 Series) - 13.28GB (5 hidden partitions that come with windows 8 pre-installed \"Recovery, Restore, System, Other System Reserved, and Unallocated\" and only reduced size in \"Restore\" partition to save about 7GB) = 219.61GB remaining for the OS partition alone. 219.61GB (OS partition) - 56.87GB (Average size of the entire OS on an SSD drive with System Restore memory deleted/disabled, Virtual memory Disabled to \"No Paging file size = 0MB\", and CCleaner with Disk cleanup preformed) = 162.74GB Free Space for user to install programs, copy data to SSD, and simply free space alone.Optionally the Free user space could be increased if useless programs are uninstalled like Asus software, or if the pre installed partitions are deleted like \"Restore\" partition which after being altered and reduced in size, still takes up 11.98GB. As far as I know, the restore partition is used to reset Windows 8 if the user is planning to sell the laptop or at least start back to factory settings as if the laptop was purchased brand new. It is a very useful function as the old methods of using a recovery disk are long gone but to some hardcore users, a restore is just pointless so this partition could be removed and nothing would be bricked or messed up. The only thing I experienced with removing it was when I select the format windows option through windows 8 OS, I would receive a \"Unable to find recovery partition\". Another method some can use is the ability to create a recovery usb with the \"Restore\" partition and then delete the partition after. The options are countless but depends on the users choice.6 Total Partitions:* = Hidden Partition (Appears to be invisible in Windows)Name of partition = Size of partition1. *Unallocated  = 508.00 KB2. *Other System Reserved  = 128.00 MB3. *Recovery  = 900.00 MB4. *Restore  = 11.98 GB (Space after reducing partiton size. Original size = 20.01 GB)5. *System  = 300 MB6. OS  = 219.61 GB\"Going Human Mode... CMD://Civilian... [Insert] Command... Success!\"So with everything I have to say in a nutshell for those users reading and saying \"W-T-F\", I managed to take a machine like this and get a powerhouse with 32GB Ram at 1600Mhz, 250GB SSD with 162.74GB Free Space for whatever I want including OS installed, a 1TB HD with 931.51GB free space for any data, pictures, you name it, and the standard i7 processor which everyone has by default with this model machine and wola!Price Paid Clean:Machine:  $1369.9932GB:  $182250GB SSD: $155= $1,542.99 Spent. Comparing to other model laptops out there, this is the best custom price possible as of now. (Of course building a desktop with this money would have been superior but I need portability and style. This will be my college laptop so I need the fluid movement.If anything else I should mention, I also bought this.1. Mobile Edge Alienware Orion ScanFast Checkpoint Friendly 17.3-Inch Backpack (Fits perfectly for laptop! I still love Alienware products but I go with what the wallet wants and can afford to eat. Besides, this 2013 year model laptops for Alienware got me upset. They are looking more professional business like rather than *atmospheric galactic outer space feeling* like)Rule of thumb, If you are looking for a decent laptop to do everything todays society asks in programming, editing, videos, ect, and want brand then get this laptop. You don't need my given upgrades but It helps for those total geek heads.If you love Alienware or LED lights on laptops but need to conserve $ like me all the time, buy an Alienware used or buy this instead (MSI G Series GE70 2OE-017US 17.3-Inch Laptop (Black/Red)Save $100 off the Asus brand name and get better MSI sound quality, led color keyboard, 7200RPM HD, Bluray Disk Drive, and Somewhat Faster Wi-Fi Card.I have said enough.

Go Go GO!*** UPDATE: *** 08-15-13For all users with SSD's or any laptop in general! Helpful tips to save data! If you don't use Hibernation mode, Disable that! Saves you about 10-24GB off the bat! Depends on your pc or HD but to do this follow my words:Simply run \"CMD\" as Admin and copy and paste this line in the black box \"powercfg -h off\".In seconds you will have more data on the hard drive! Helpful for SSD users! Here is s a link with more info:[...]Tip #2: I recently noticed in the beginning that my laptop was acting strange with updates and super long restarts and even infinite restart loops! To fix this issue:1. Click Start then type CMD into the search area to locate the command prompt (cmd.exe).2. RIGHT CLICK the command prompt icon and choose \"Run As Administrator\" - you must have administrator rights.3. In the command prompt type in \"sfc /scannow\"4. Do something productive for about 15 Minutes or so and then return to laptop until it is complete.5. Restart your computer.6. Update restart issues should be no more.(Tip #2 was copied and pasted from another Amazon Reviewer named \"Lam Hoang\". Credits to his type and work!)*** UPDATE: *** 08-31-13Laptop still runs like a pro and no issues what so ever. I want to continue to mention that I noticed that Nvidia had released a Video driver update for the laptop for Nvidia Driver 320.49. If you attempt to update this by simply downloading the driver through the Nvidia update procedure, you will get a failure message saying \"Compatiable Hardware not found\". To counter this issue, go to the official Asus website, Type in G750 J, look under downloads, and download the latest LAN driver. This will then fix the issue with the Nvidia software temporarily. According to multiple users, the Nivida update 320.49 has caused countless issues so until a fix is made, patience is required. Took a while to find out why this wasn't working but common sense brought me to explore and resolve :) Enjoy users!*** UPDATE: *** 09-19-13If you haven't already, maybe it's been fixed without this method, but Nvidia seems to have fixed the issue retaining to the strange unable to find hardware update \"Compatiable Hardware not found\". If you have't already, update your Nvidia GPU to the latest driver by first installing the latest LAN driver for the G750 on the Asus website and through that, updating the GPU to (327.23). Things are smooth as butter cake :)*** UPDATE: *** 03-15-14I haven't made a quick update since 177 days ago XD Anyways, been going through college with this laptop and not once has it failed me. Rest assured. All parts are functioning and as a matter a fact, I attempted to preform all sorts of additional experiments with it. I managed to run VMware program (A program where you can emulate operating systems inside operating systems) and thanks to the 32GB of ram, I can run nearly 5 different systems at one given time fluidly. Also, I spent some time looking into RamDisk software (Uses Ram as a virtual hard drive temporarily and gives speed results of data transfers and handling nearly = 84.5X faster than HDD and = 12.5X better than SSD). The results are extremely promising and can't stress enough how nicely this machine can still run. Finally, I finally had the chance to update Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 and the procedure was fairly well. After complete however, I had to re configure about 10 different application settings and make sure everything was back on track. Hardly noticed anything different with the new update but I like to keep track with updates and performance. Gaming wise, I finally tested out one game Just Cause 2 on high settings and the machine handles everything without flaw. Using mods, I enjoy flying around the endless world of just cause pretending to be within virtual reality from time to time to get away from life. More on Just cause mods simply look on youtube and type in superman just cause 2 mods. That is really it. Hope to update more often as college stress gets reduced here and there ^.^", "Date": "July 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good, but not without its flaws", "Author": "Michael Barnathan", "ReviewID": "R3I22U9ZCZY8X5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this laptop for about a week now and have generally been happy with it, though with a couple of caveats. First impression on unboxing: this thing is HUGE! It's both large and heavy, neither of which particularly bothers me (and of course, I saw the 9.9lb weight going in). Next, ergonomics: with the weird games that other manufacturers are playing with laptop keyboards right now, it's refreshing to see one that touches smoothly and ergonomically. It's still not as comfortable as my desktop keyboard, but I can at least see myself coding away for days at a time (as is my wont) without developing carpal tunnel syndrome.The keyboard includes a separate set of arrow keys in the standard shape used on desktops, which makes me very happy, as I use these keys very often.The external finish is kind of blocky, but when you open it up, it's gorgeous, with a very nice brushed aluminum look that unfortunately smudges very easily. As the other poster said, you're going to get fingerprints on it; it's inevitable. Heck, it even smudges on its own when it gets a little bit humid out. This laptop has a matte display, which I find does a much better job of reducing glare than my previous glossy laptop display, at the expense of gamut width (nevertheless, I was able to get a ~90% overlap with sRGB on mine, so it's not bad). There does seem to be a minor issue with the refresh rate of the display: it seems just a tad off of 60Hz, as refreshes are very slightly visible against solid colors (dark gray in particular). This seems to be accentuated when the backlight is dim and is much less noticeable when the laptop is plugged in and the backlight is at full brightness. This is something that I can live with; you might consider it more serious if you're particularly prone to eyestrain. Make sure to uninstall the bundled Splendid software if you have color issues, as it had a detrimental effect on color for me which was resolved by removing it.Performance-wise, this thing is a beast, limited primarily by its 5400 RPM hard drive. Which brings me to one of the reasons why I purchased this particular laptop (incurring the weight and bulk): it has two 2.5\" hard drive bays. I loaded an SSD (Crucial m500) into the 2nd bay and it found it without a problem. I haven't tried it yet, but copying the OS over to the SSD and using the old HD as a backup drive should result in a *substantial* performance improvement, as the hard drive was the primary bottleneck.The graphics card isn't quite up to desktop levels either (but then, laptops seldom are), but it's quite capable of running most of today's games. It's also CUDA-enabled, so I can run Fast Fourier Transforms on it to my heart's content.Power consumption is quite good considering the specs, an area where the Haswell processor clearly makes a difference. I can get about 4-5 hours of use from a full charge. I haven't noticed a substantial boost in raw computing power over Ivy Bridge just yet, but I haven't yet challenged the limits of this machine.The DVD-ROM drive is nothing special, and I may simply replace it with the Blu-ray recorder from my previous laptop. This seems a larger trend right now - the last 5 years have seen a regression in optical drives, as USB flash memory is becoming more and more popular. Speaking of that, this laptop has a built in SD card reader.If you want to get on the cutting edge of Wifi, this also has an 802.11ac network adapter, so you're all ready.Overall, I'm rather pleased with the laptop - the slow drive speed and minor display refresh problems being the primary drawbacks. I would recommend it.", "Date": "July 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Needed a gaming laptop because of my small living space.", "Author": "William", "ReviewID": "R2QW9KNJO5X7D2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a gaming laptop to step in for a desktop, because there was no way for me to run a gaming tower in my current living space.Boy did I get one.Pros - 1.

It plays all the games I like at max resolution, though lately I've only been playing Star Trek Online.  However whereas my previous laptop couldn't keep up with the game's graphics, this one allows me to crank all settings to the maximum while also running other apps in the background that I can alt-tab to.A lot of reviewers ding this product for having a slow HDD.  I was a little worried about that too before I purchased it.  But honestly I don't notice any game-loading lag or problems opening files or whatnot.One of the things that surprised me, and that I hadn't seen in a review, is the great speaker system.  My previous laptop pretty much required the use of headphones to get quality sound.  Not so with this one.  That was a pleasant surprise and gives my ears a nice break.Another plus...I use Rosetta Stone a lot and the built-in mic is good enough that I don't have to use my headphone/mic.  It's a little feature, I suppose, but another pleasant surprise.The only thing I would ding it on...and this is really, really nitpicking...is the '0' key on the numeric keypad.

It's a high end laptop that's built really well.  It came with no defects, other than Windows 8 and a very slow harddrive (5400rpm).  The first thing I did after pulling it out of the box was swap in the Samsung MZ-7PD128BW 840 Pro Series 128GB solid state drive.  That drive is about $100 right now, and since this laptop has two easily available harddrive slots, I just kept the 1TB that came with the computer as a spare space for pictures and videos.  I'm pretty sure they just expect everyone to do this swap, because the 5400rpm harddrive stands in stark contrast to all the rest of the specs.I bought this laptop primarily for its spectacular CPU and large 1080p matte screen, and it's great on both fronts.  I was attracted to the heat dissipation going out the back rather than downward into my lap... but as it turns out, this thing runs quite cool most of the time.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the battery lasts quite long when doing mundane internet / word processing tasks (approx 5 hours).  It's pretty sleek looking and with the SSD drive I installed, it's blazing fast. My one complaint at this moment is that the mouse pad is so large and close to the keyboard that I periodically hit it accidentally, but I'll learn to avoid it.I'll write back if there are any issues or major changes in my conclusion about this being a great buy.[EDIT March 3, 2014]There is currently a sound card or sound card driver issue with this laptop which you can find pretty easily with a google search on this model. It causes \"low impedance headphones\" (read: regular headphones) to have a slight \"buzz\" when the sound card is 'active' (that is, in use by some application) and it's currently silent. An example would be listening to speech, since there are often silent delays during speech audio. This issue has not made me regret the purchase, the laptop has been great... but this is definitely something people should know about if audio through headphones is one of their primary activities. I often use this laptop to listen to lectures, and I don't find it particular bothersome. With music, I'm sure it's completely unnoticeable.The other thing is about the SSD drive I mentioned above. Combining that drive with this laptop is just mind-blowing. The computer boots up and gets on the internet about as fast as I can click.. I can open all MS Office applications at once as fast as I can click. I can bring the computer out of hibernation as fast as bringing it out of sleep (instantaneously). For those who intend on using this computer without upgrading the 5400rpm to a SSD - you really should reconsider. The convenience of having zero delay response from this computer is great - with the only downside that I'm now impatient with just about any other computer I use.", "Date": "February 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great product, required repairs", "Author": "Jason Krein", "ReviewID": "R7SH0ZJR4TN1Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I bought this laptop primarily for gaming - it was between this and the Lenovo Y510p, (They were both about the same price as I bought it during a sale) and decided on the G750JW because of the fact that it has only one graphics card, and I could add another hard drive to it.When I first received the product from amazon, the battery was bricked and graphics switching didn't work. However, I called ASUS support and after a bunch of troubleshooting, agreed to do a repair. The paid for shipping but not the box which was only ~30 dollars, and the repair was done in about 3 days, they even fixed a couple problems I wasn't aware of (namely the CD drive was broken or something) and now the laptop works like a charm. So onto pros and cons.Pros:- The GTX 765M is a great card, I have yet to throw super intensive games at it (since I don't own many) but it runs CS:GO at a constant 200 fps, TF2 with 150, and runs Deus Ex Human Revolution smoothly (I haven't checked FPS in it, but it's definitely above 60)- Battery holds charge for a good amount of time, all things considered - about 3.5 hours.- Keyboard is great for regular typing, unfortunately (and I find this for all laptop keyboards) I personally don't like playing FPS on it because it's not quite as responsive as a separate keyboard, but it'll do in a pinch.- 2 hard drive bays, very easy to access. I put in a 128GB SSD and it boots in like 4 seconds from hard shutdown. If you do more video editing and need lots of space, you could always pop in a second HDD if that suits you better.- 4 USB ports is nice, the ultra-charge or whatever they call it is sweet because it can charge even when the laptop is in sleep mode- Has a separate mic port, so if the laptop mic isn't good enough for you, you can use a non-usb mic (so headsets will work)- Good temps - after like 3 hours Deus Ex:HR the GPU is at 50\u00b0C, CPUs at 26\u00b0 avg- Backlighting is nice-Cons- A lot of cords go on the right side so can get in the way of a wired mouse- Is kind of big, I mostly keep it in my dorm though so not a big deal for me, however if you plan to do a LOT of travel it's not a great thing to keep sitting on your lap, usually is good to have a surface- Sometimes after a sound plays a little bit of constant static keeps going after the sound stops, may just be a driver issue though.That's about it, overall it's a great gaming laptop, and runs everything I've thrown at it just fine.

After doing a good bit of looking around at the different models of laptops out there I ultimately decided to invest in the Asus G750JW, and I haven't regretted my decision yet.  This laptop will be a great asset to have in my various college classes as well as my casual gaming sessions.  Since I am upgrading from a pretty dated model of a laptop any of my comparisons made will be based off such.  I'm not the type of individual who has to chop into his devices and modify them to heck and do any of that overclocking business.  That said I'm not a COMPLETE novice, just a \u201ccasual\u201d novice haha. I really only made this expensive investment so I wouldn't have to buy another laptop in a long while. However, in a nutshell, I have been very surprised and pleased with it overall.I had actually planned on getting the Lenovo y510p gaming laptop because of the cheaper price.  I was also willing to take all the many cons that came with the Lenovo again, because of that price.  However, after five nightmarish weeks of extremely lackluster and incompetent customer service, a ridiculous wait time for the device to ship (yes, ship), and then getting my order canceled behind my back after telling me it would arrive on December 6th, I finally had enough and ordered the G750JW with one day shipping and had it here on the 6th.  Needless to say I will never even look at a Lenovo product ever again.As for performance, this thing never ceases to amaze me.  I recently bought The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim so I could get a pretty good challenge for my new laptop.  I decided I would test the G750JW's performance based off the \u201cstandard\u201d set by my desktop computer, which can also do intensive gaming.  My desktop is running an AMD FX-6100 CPU and that gets blown out the water by the G750JW's CPU (according to CPU benchmark.net).  My desktop has a Radeon HD 7770 graphics card and it's about even with G750JW (according to videocardbenchmark.net).  Visually, the Skyrim graphics on the G750JW are excellent.  I have the game turned up to the \u201cUltra\u201d settings and the laptop performs flawlessly.  I recently came across a free recording program that records whatever-the-heck I do while I do it and this machine still performs with no detectable drop in the framerate.  Another game I play frequently is the MMORPG Tera Online.  I primarily played it on my desktop so when I tried it on this laptop, after putting all the video elements to max, the performance was, again, excellent.  I've read that most gaming laptops suffer a serious framerate when they are not plugged in and that holds true for the G570JW as well.  However, when I play Skyrim, it seems to perform just fine if I take it out of it's \u201cPower4gear Power Save Mode\u201d and put it to balanced.  When I play Tera unplugged, the video skips and jerks around way too much to play correctly.  And even if you decided to stomach the drop in performance you will find yourself away from the wall outlets for a very long time.  My Toshiba Satelite would only go for a little under 2 hours until it needed to be charged again.  The G750JW can get me an average of 6 hours just surfing the internet and doing minor tasks (like Skype), making it perfect for those college lectures that last for eternity.  I have even been able to play Skyrim for around 4 or so hours unplugged but I've yet to play any other games off the charger.However, with any laptop there are always cons.  But I have yet to notice any real glaring issues, just a few issues to note and keep in mind.  I have only had this laptop for about a month.  As far as cons go, basically the ones I\u2019ve noticed are fairly minor (and somewhat random.)* The laptop IS a literal heavy-weight but it's not as bad as some have made it out to be; I can game with this bad boy on my lap no problem (heck I even fell asleep with it sitting there.)  You will get used to it, although it can be quite a workout toting this thing around in a bookbag.* Another thing to note is the keyboard (which I really like.)  It has plenty of feedback when you press on the keys however it MAY take some getting used to in order to get it to register all keystrokes properly.  I found I had to push a little more definitively (compared to my Toshiba) when I type, but this, too, is something I have already gotten used to.* The powercord fits in snuggly into the computer receptacle however due to the \u201cL\u201d shape of the part that goes into it, it may be a bit awkward to move the computer around while plugged in.  Another thing to keep in mind, for use during car travel, is to make sure your car adapter converter box can handle the G750's watt output.* Speaking of awkward, the placement/length of the eject button will probably cause frequent  and accidental ejections of the disk bay if you are the type to carry it laptop on the sides when moving it short distances.* I'm not sure if this is consistent with all models, but the plastic bezel on the screen (right where it says \u201cASUS\u201d ) is loose and can be tugged away from the screen slightly.  Honestly though, I get along just fine ignoring it* Due to the sheer size of the touch pad mouse you will find many accidental movements of the mouse because of that Windows 8 gestures function.  I simply set the computer to disable the touchpad when a USB mouse is plugged in.* As others have said about the chasis of the G750, it IS in fact a dust and oil magnet. Depending on the individual, the oil smears aren't so bad and are really noticeable on the rather large palm rests, however the dust seems to be especially prominent in the light. This is an issue that can literally be wiped away.* One small gripe: finding proper carrying measures for this tank of a laptop took a fair amount of effort.  I wound up buying a Kenneth Cole Reaction 18.4\u201d carrying case for it, but most 17\u201d cases do not fit this thing at all.My Toshiba Satellite had a latch that kept the screen securely attached to the base of the laptop so one could travel without the screen coming apart however slightly.  The G750JW had no latch and when I put it into my laptop case, the screen and base collide in kind of \u201cchattering\u201d motion upon the slightest vibration during travel.  The only reason I note this is because it gives me concern for the screen, and for the hinges, to constantly be jostled like that.Despite the above minor gripes, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and am happy I joined the republic (instead of getting one of those lap-roasting Lenovos).  I will continue to put some graphical stress on this machine and see how it performs.  If you are upgrading from a 15.6 inch model laptop, like I did with my Toshiba, I think you will like the extra space once you make proper accommodations for it.

The 1024 GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive that comes with the laptop does not fit the spec. and the performance of this awesome machine.  Its really slow to boot up (relatively speaking compared to any PC with a SSD).>> I fixed this by installing a 250 GB Samsung SSD to run the Windows 8 OS and 1TB SSHD for applications and data (the PC has dual drive bays).  Once Windows 8 finally downloaded all its updates (it does this in background), the PC now boots up in less than 5 seconds.2. When you close the lid, the PC goes into sleep mode so all your applications 'die'.>> By default, the Power4Gear Hybrid Software for handling the power options does not save the applications' data to disk before putting the PC into sleep mode hence all your open applications die.  You need to go into the settings and set the 'Allow hybrid sleep' to 'On'.  This should be the default!3. Nvidia drivers cannot be installed from the GeForce Experience application so your games report that you have an old driver and the game may crash.>> The reason for this is Asus has its own updater for the PC drivers although the Live update does not detect when there are new drivers on the Asus support website!!  You have to download these manually and install them yourself, WTF!4. I've installed Rainmeter on the PC and you cannot hide desktop icons using the 'View->Show desktop icons' option.  Even if you set this to be off, when the PC is rebooted, the desktop icons are shown again even though they are suppose to be off.>> You can only turn them off in the Power4Gear Hybrid application under the Enable/Disable menu item > Hide Desktop Icons!5. Window 8 is annoying on a PC as there is no Statup menu for accessing all windows applications.>> I fixed this by installing the ClassicShell (See: [...] this should be fixed in Windows 8.1.6. The metal around the keyboard is really nice but is difficult to keep clean.  Greasy fingers with leave marks everywhere.>> I wear gloves now when using the PC (only joking).Note, if you open the back panel, you will see only a 4 GB memory module installed.  Don't worry there is a further 8 GB installed somewhere else where you can't get at without openning up the unit and invalidating your warranty.  There is a free memory slot for a further upgrade but 12 GB seems to be enough for running all the games I have (COH2, Tomb Raider 2013, StarCraft Heart of the Swarm) and photographs post processing.So nearly happy with the PC although I needed to spend some more money and time in fixing the above problems.  Would be interested to hear from someone who brought the equalivalent Alienware PC if similar things on their laptop annoys them as this was the other laptop I was considering.

It had a loud popping every half second or so coming from the \"subwoofer\" on the bottom of the laptop. Adjusting the volume had no effect on either of these issues. I returned it with no problems from Amazon and was sent another. This one seemed good, except the headphone jack produced an annoying static hiss over my $400 dollar headphones that sound great on any other sources. I figured I again received a defective unit and returned. Now on my third G750JW and the hiss is still there. After searching the manufacturer website forums, it appears that the issue is seen on all units.  It is rather frustrating, especially due to the fact that one of their advertised features of the notebook is a super high quality headphone amp. The problem is apparently experienced only when using low impedance headphones (most consumer headphones). Higher end high impedance headphones do not experience this hiss. Likewise, plugging external speakers into the headphone jack do not result in a hiss. So other than buying expensive high impedance phones, the only workarounds seem to be using an external USB soundcard, or using USB headphones.  Even with this major flaw, I still love the computer. Its fast, games wonderfully, has a nice feel to it, and has plenty of storage for whatever you need.

They rank this machine as the #1 Gaming AND the #1 Desktop Replacement Notebook.It is a wonderful machine despite its bulk and size. Please see the full review on notebookcheck.net, and then read my comments here. I have left out the positive parts that are clearly and scientifically covered in that review. Only including here some critical thoughts that were not mentioned there, and might help other readers. I posted this same review as a comment on notebookcheck.net as well.1. The 5400RPM hard drive makes the notebook quite slow overall. Surprising decision by ASUS to go with this - probably to reduce heat and noise. You should plan on upgrading the drive to a SSD. It is a shame to have such a great machine with such a slow drive. The good thing is that with 1TB of space, the drive is ideal to be a secondary storage drive.2. The size of the touch pad, causes the area of the palm below the thumbs to touch the pad. With gestures turned on, this causes the right palm to create the swipe in gesture to bring up the Charms bar inadvertently. This happens all the time. This issue would not have existed if the keyboard had been wider spaced and centered on the body rather than shifted left to accommodate the number pad on the right. This is a pretty bad design flaw - may have to turn off at least the charms bar gesture due to this. What is even more aggravating is that ASUS does not let you change the gesture to make it different - you can only turn off or turn on the gestures. Another severe limitation to think about.3. The Smart Gesture software supports all the typical gestures found on the Macbook trackpad, but sadly you can only turn them off and on. Cannot change the location of the swipe or anything else. Very limiting and irritating.4. Having the entire touchpad and keyboard shifted to the left is very disconcerting. Many windows (especially newer full screen application windows) are centered on the screen, and you constantly get the feeling of being in a left-hand drive car. Almost all notebooks are beginning to have this flaw. The one lone one that I have found to not have this is the ThinkPad W530. I hope they keep their sensible keyboard layout. Numberpads are overrated. For gaming it is better to get a separate stand alone device with the right keys - or even a standalone USB numberpad. Another bad design flaw.5. As was stated by Allen.Ngo, the graininess is similar to other panels with anti-glare. It becomes visible on white backgrounds if you look at the panel surface instead of looking (as one usually does) deeper into the text/graphics on the display. Not too bothersome, but you will clearly see the difference between it and a glossy screen. The glossy of course has the problem with reflection.6. The rubberized lid cover is nice - has a soft touch to it, BUT, it gathers dust very easily. Because of its soft rubber texture, the dust sticks to it and is difficult to clean away. It does not just swipe away. You will need to carry along a lint-free wipe of some kind and be wiping it every so often.7. There is no latch mechanism to keep the lid close to the base when closed. The lid literally bounces around a bit in the closed position. Very strange. There is no magnetic support to keep them together either.All these issues apart, the machine seems to be nice. Will likely be keeping it, though disappointed with the above factors. It is still perhaps the best machine on the market at its price point.

I bought this laptop last week and those are some feeling. This is the first time I write a review for laptop.ProsFirst of all, Asus is a strong branch in laptop industry and the most advantage of Asus laptop model is power in process graphic and stronger than the specification. The screen is too large up to 17.2 inches, the laptop can display full resolution 1920*1080 pixels. This is the advantage for designer or gamer because they must use the large screen for display right pixel.Secondly, With CPU core i7 3.4Ghz and RAM 12 Gb DDR III Graphic 2.5Gb Geforce. This is actually powerful machine, with this system you can run any applications and games. My work use 3dMax, Photoshop for designer and Eclipse for build Android application and never seen any problem.ConsBeside, with those features this laptop is to heavy and quite big when you moving. And with the storage only 1Tb, you need to extra more with the external storage.Any great products have many pros and cons, But I recommend this laptop, because I am using it and feel comfortable in work and relax.

However, when on battery power they are considerably slower. It turns out that ASUS has throttled the CPU and GPU when the G750 series is on battery power in order to inflate their battery life numbers. Plugged in, the CPU runs at 3.3 GHz (Task Manager - Performance tab). Pull the plug and go on battery and the CPU drops to .77 GHz (approx 25%). ASUS did this knowingly as they have a BIOS UPDATE (#208) to fix this problem but the fix doesn't work. Customer support is of no use as they didn't know (or admit to knowing) about the throttling or the BIOS update 208 to supposedly fix it. If you want a laptop to use plugged in on your desk, this is great.

They want US to pay for their error, sending it in, paying for shipping, paying for repairs, and moreover, ignoring their mistake and making no effort to remedy it. The problem is evident. Just simply Google search \"Asus G75VW shutting down\" (Asus, I suggest you do this to educate yourself as well, or to attempt to instill some feeling of guilt in you). You will see multiple forums with people with this problem for their supposed best gaming notebook.  Many people have attempted to fix things, but seeing as Asus is ignoring this, they haven't released any statements as to the exact issue, and therefore, no remedy other than making more money off of us by sending it to them for \"Repairs\".So, I propose we start filing complaints to our state attorney generals consumer departments. The more complaints we get the more likely the state attorney general will act on our behalf in regard to this problem.I am in NY state, so I especially encourage anyone living here to file something so we can hopefully get some action taken against this supposed great company.Their customer service representatives are close to useless, telling me to purchase recovery discs after I said I have reformatted. Giving me instructions for the wrong OS, and so on.So, let's try and do something. Please contact your own attorney general so we can all try to get a cost free solution to this problem, one that isnt at OUR expense to THEIR errors. Please include your attempts at contact them and your own remedies.For those in NY, please go here![...]Asus also said to go here for complaints to them, though I doubt, given their record, they will do anything.[...]Good luck all. :)", "Date": "March 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Better than what I had but doesn't live up to expectations...", "Author": "R.

Anyways, while this does at least run games like Far Cry 3 and Skyrim on medium settings which my MBP running Windows 7 with Intel 3000HD could only hope to run with everything low (& still lag), I am disappointed with the performance. I have updated all the drivers, but yet I still experience lag even on medium settings. This is disappointing as before I upgraded my desktop to a GTX 670 FTW, it was running just a regular GTX 650 with no overclock and even it would run before mentioned games on high settings with zero lag. The GTX 765M supposedly tested higher on 3dMark than the GTX 650 desktop card, but real game performance shows significantly less performance. I checked and the computer is utilizing the GTX 765M and not integrated Intel 4000HD (which is permanently disabled on this particular model). I can't say how this laptops performs relative to other laptops in its price range or how other people maybe got it to perform better, but it definitely hasn't lived fully up to my expectations... I am going to continue Internet research and tinkering, but I am thinking about looking into return options. Since I got it from Best Buy instead of Amazon, I have a feeling I will probably just have to make the best of it.

I updated the BIOS from the 207 to the 208, and that helped a lot. I updated all drivers including the wireless and GPU and it seems slightly more stable. It still crashes and I'm going to blame Windows 8 and their lack of full compatibility with the GPU. At this point I'm thoroughly annoyed by the amount of crashing*1/6/2014So I've had this laptop for almost 4 months. I turned the 1TB hard drive into a backup hard drive that I use for files and other OS's that I multi-boot. I transferred Windows 8 to a 128GB SSD, it takes about 15 seconds to load. In November I ditched Windows all together for Linux Mint 16 and haven't looked back since. Instead I multi-boot various OS's and only use Windows 8 for gaming now. I've updated to Windows 8.1 and it still crashes occasionally, but I'm about 99% positive it's from the Nvidia driver. I've been able to play games like Borderlands 2, Far Cry 3, and Bioshock Infinite all on Ultra graphic settings and it rarely lags and they run pretty smoothly. Overall I'm more satisfied about this laptop now, than when I initially received it. I suggest a backpack like the Targus XL backpack if you intend to haul this around, because it's hard finding a case that fits.*3/3/2014At this point I'm trying to move away from Ubuntu to Debian but there is a massive lack of support of the hardware. Ubuntu's driver manager allows you to quickly assign drivers through the GUI and they're extremely stable. For anyone wanting to use Debian, good luck! You will have to configure the wireless and Nvidia drivers manually. I went through and created a shell script to do this. So if you're wanting to switch to Linux, but don't have experiance with Linux, then I highly suggest Ubuntu. Debian will be a challenge, but I can confirm that I have configured drivers for Broadcom BCM4352 wireless card and Nvidia GeForce GTX 765M.The only thing I truly hate about this laptop is how I always get the hair on my arm caught in the trim along the edge of the laptop.
