{"Reviews": [{"Title": "best value premium notebook in the market today", "Author": "Objective", "ReviewID": "RI8A2TFS1TL0L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used the Sony Vaio SB18 notebook for almost two years.  It is now falling apart, which is a shame given Sony's strong reputation.  The right ports are all starting to give way and the hard disk is making a strange sound that usually means it will die soon.Anyhow, good excuse for a change!  I bought this notebook with two differences:  1) its orange (which is beautiful) and 2) the seller threw in an extra 4 gb of ram (not bad - ram prices have been rising).My initial requirements were as follows:1)  had to be min Full HD (1920x1080) - given that most tablets and phones are at that resolution already, it is crazy how many notebooks still have 1378x768 screens.2)  SSD - my Sony was a normal hard disk and it was slow, esp when booting up3)  touch screen4)  thin and light5)  long battery life and thus 4th gen Haswell processor6)  looks goodIt is amazing how few notebooks actually meet all these criteria!  There was of course, the Sony Pro, the Dell XPS, Asus UX32 (not full SSD), Acer s7.I ended up with a very clear choice in the Yoga 2 - it was the only one that beat all these specs (3200x1800 screen, 256gb SSD, great Hinge) and at the same time the cheapest!It has been a week and I really like it.  It is fast, the screen is gorgeous, the WIFI is very fast (even though it isn't a/c), it is relatively light and thin, etc.  I find myself surprisingly using the other formats a lot - full tablet to read e-magazines (the extra real estate relative to an iPad makes a lot of difference), stand mode to watch videos, etc.  I can see myself using Tent mode on an economy class flight too.  The keyboard is really nice (using it now to type this review).  The motion sensors are great for reading and for flipping through photos. Windows 8 takes a bit of getting used to but so far so good.A good review wouldn't be complete without the cons.  As much as I love this machine, it does get hotter than I would have expected.  Battery lasts a full day at the office and some reading at home but that's about it - you can see the battery life dipping dangerously in the evening.  There are occasional stutters when many apps are open - am still trying to figure out how to close apps properly in Win 8.My purchase came with an external DVD player (handy), a Samsonite carrying case (v nice), a wireless mouse (why would anyone need that with a touchscreen and a great touchpad?) and 3 years Mcafee anti virus (useful).  Also a full 2 year warranty.Strongly recommended!p.s.  as an investor, I worry about Lenovo's competitors.  Lenovo seems to be using its scale and huge china enterprise business to bring prices down on its consumer offerings.  It is effectively selling great products at great prices.  It seems to have gotten its distribution and logistics organized better too (While the Yoga was available on the spot in both colours, the Dell XPS and Asus UX32 had a one month waiting time), clearly due to its scale as well.  While this is clearly great for consumers like us, it doesn't bode well at all for its competition (Acer is already showing signs of strain).  It reminds me a lot of what Samsung has done in the smartphone market", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "very sad problem for a nice promising device", "Author": "Karla N Xavier", "ReviewID": "R2ZK5J1WSFFHOV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Nice looking device, good battery life, good display, quick enough for most things.Then there's the blackscreen issue.  Extremely disappointed that after 1 monthof use my Yoga 2 now will not display anything. The screen is black no matter how many times I try it.  Search for Yoga 2 blackscreen then decide for yourself if you want to chance it.nice while it worked.", "Date": "February 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Terrible and Terrible Service", "Author": "Fariz", "ReviewID": "R22S0NEL2I27GU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Well. Placed an order through the lenovo.com. Ordered one but got charged for two. Took 2 hours to get it cleared. The order was supposed to be shipped yesterday nothing happened yet. Customer service can not figure out what the status of the order is and when it could be shipped. I am about canceling the order.
