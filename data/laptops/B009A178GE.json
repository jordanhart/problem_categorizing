{"Reviews": [{"Title": "HP ENVY dv7", "Author": "jasper", "ReviewID": "R43NHSCUPTA9V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I replaced my dell inspiron with this laptop, and I was quite impressed when I first layed my hands upon the envy dv7.First off, I would like to inform everyone that this laptop DOES have LED back-lit lights for the keyboard. It does not state that in the product description for some odd manner. (Thanks to whoever commented confirming this)EXTERIOR DESIGN:  It has a very solid chrome-like feel. It isn't made of plastic except for the outer edges of the screen (which most laptops these days are trending to have), but the rest is very sturdy. It has an LED-lit HP logo, and also a light if you plug in your computer through the ethernet via the ethernet cable. A small warning would be that the light is particularly bright, but that does not bother me one bit when I go to bed, as it is all personal preference. Another smaller LED light is next to the charger port, but compared to the other lights, this one is barely noticeable.  The Keyboard is very sleek, living up to my expectations. The keys are able to be lit-up with a bright white LED, which can be turned on/off at any time of preference. Overall, the keyboard is nicely done and comfortable to use by HP, as all other Envy models. Same goes for the mousepad.PERFORMANCE:  I was impressed in that they lived up to their spec's expectations. It boots up very quickly from a hard shutdown to a working desktop in around 20-30 seconds. With 8 gb ram, multitasking is strongly encouraged, with a 2.5 gHz clockspeed processor. However I must note that this is not a gaming laptop. Intel HD graphics 4000 is at the very low end of the graphics card department, but that does not drag down my experience with this laptop. Intel is still known for delivering crisp and simple graphics, though it isn't made for anything too graphic intensive. Overall the general performance was generally good. This laptop contains necessary components for a business computer, or a simple personal laptop.  The camera was flat-out average, with the mio. Nothing was too impressive here, it was all standard.  The sound was impressively loud. I would always be shocked of the capabilities of noise being produced by the Envy dv7, though I wish the subwoofer can do more of the base work. The sound quality was kind of a let-down. I could feel the base change as I toggle it through the Beats program, however the change is not very noticeable. This is not a problem for me though, because I usually only use my laptops at home, with built-in conveniences such as another external 3-inch creative sub woofer with surrounding speakers.OVERALL:Pros:-Fast in general for basic use-Great specs for price-Great sturdy build-Loud built-in speakers-Great layout with lit-up keyboard and comfortable mouse pad-17.3 inches delivers crisp experience-Very conservative buildCons:-Not made for anything graphic intensive like games-Camera and mic are average-Speaker quality didn't live up to the hype it has receivedI am not saying anything about windows 8 because I feel like it should not affect a PC/laptop's rating in general. I feel like if you want to review 2 stars on a laptop just because you strongly dislike windows 8, you should review windows 8 directly somewhere else.OVERALL= 4/5EDIT: The youtube problem and adobe flash had nothing to do with this laptop", "Date": "February 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "good,bad, and frustrating--and the fixed", "Author": "grrlgeek", "ReviewID": "R1YLZM9G7K320I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "On November 15, 2012, I wrote this review:  Hadthe beastfor 24hours now and used it about 12 of them.

The new one arrived and--after Thanksgiving holiday--I had time to explore the Envy.The same delights: speed, graphics, big display, fast boot and shut down, fast change between apps, were all there. The keyboard works well, and I notice, the mouse buttons are easy too. After a day or so of typing, I am as fast as ever I was on my other keyboards. In fact, the keyboard has a nice feel: a gentle travel, responsive, nice space between keys to lessen the dread two letters/one touch problem. The ports are good, the SD up front is good design.I'm upping from the original three stars to five. It is a handsome, quick, useful, easy to use, much more than adequate to my current needs. I don't regret the earlier review, HP's quality control should have caught that. I'm very glad I bought from Amazon. Their excellent customer service made the small increase ($6)over the lowest online price well worth it.", "Date": "November 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "If not for windows 8.....", "Author": "george l borton", "ReviewID": "R2KZRGKM09IBS7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I needed a laptop with a large screen and a solid processor. This seemed to fit the bill. It arrived quickly and was well packaged. It. The screen is crisp and clear and the full size keyboard is quite usable. The sound is also very good. It has held up to well to minor abuse. I am also quite pleased with the battery life.The only short coming is windows 8. It is extremely infuriating. The \"metro/modern\" interface (the tiles) may have limited usability on a touchscreen (which this is not) but not in any other significant capacity. Navigating through it was an effort in frustration. Additionally, every time my mouse got to the edge or corner of the screen, some kind of windows related pop up would appear. This slowed me down as I waited for it to recede. Additionally, various build in PDF, picture, and video player/viewers were not at all user friendly. Fortunately, I was able to fix most of these issued. By using Adobe PDF reader and VLC video player as the default, I was able to replace the incredibly frustrating native Windows 8 viewers. I was also able to solve the windows 8 usability issue.While I was researching laptops, I found references by others to a program called CLASSIC SHELL. I had not used windows 8 previous and within 30 seconds of full boot up that it would be a mandatory installation. It installed quite easily and Windows 8 went from being a (to be polite and thereby less accurate) tremendous headache to being usable. It removed the worthless Metro/modern/tile interface, provided a standard start button, allow for disabling of the edge of screen pop ups, and provided easy access to all of Windows functionality. In other words is basically made it like previous versions of Windows. Without CLASSIC SHELL, I would have been forced to return this computer for one with windows 7.This computer would have rated 5 stars except for the fact that it came with Windows 8. It would have been rated 2 stars except that the problem that is windows 8 was so easily fixed.Would I recommend this to others? Yes but only with the above mentioned fixes. Otherwise, no.

Unfortunately, I let it sit in the box until he opened it on his graduation day so, my 30 day return policy from the store was already used up. Upon turning on the computer for the first time, we were unable to connect to the internet. We tried for several hours to troubleshoot on our own and then the computer simply shut down and we couldn't turn it back on. We called customer service and they were able to get it turned back on at first. After a few minutes of running, it shut down again, but this time customer service was unable to get it to work. So, we mailed it in for repair. A brand new computer, hours out of the box, being mailed in for repair. They replaced the MOTHERBOARD, upgraded the BIOS software, the power adapter and the battery, and mailed it back to us two weeks later. We turned it on, but still could not connect to the internet. I called customer service again, he did some remote work and was unable to fix the issue. He suggested I call my internet service provider and he would call to check back in 48 hours. The following day, my internet provider stated that he didn't see any issues and I waited for the HP customer service rep to call back. He didn't. By this time, we had owned the computer for about two months. It was time to take my son 1100 miles away to college. I decided that maybe he would be able to connect to the college's internet with better luck. After arriving to his dorm, he tried to turn on the computer, it would not turn on. It was the same issue as before! This time, my son had to deal with HP customer service on his own (not fun for an adult with experience, much less an 18 year old kid). As before, the rep was able to get it turned on, so he let my son get off the phone. After running for less than two minutes, it shut down again. My son called them back and they asked him to return the computer for repair again. My son called me instead and I called HP stating that I wanted the issue escalated to management because I wanted a new laptop, not just to turn this one in again for repair. They said I needed to wait 48 hours and a manager would call me back. Of course, the 48 hours didn't happen, so I called back about a week later and they had no record of my conversation or that the issue had been escalated. As of now, I'm there again. I just got off the phone and they are supposedly escalating the issue and I will receive another call in 48 hours. After 7 hours worth of HP customer service phone calls, I will never purchase another HP!!

This item is very cheaply made, the warranty is a joke, and HP support is absurdly rude and useless.Update: I called HP Support again, and the first question the barely-English-speaking representative said was \"What happened before you noticed the crack? Did you take it outside or something?\"First of all, it's a laptop: you're supposed to be able to take it places.

I am replacing an aging 8 yr old Dell Inspiron that had a cost of about $2,000 in 2005 so the HP Envy has good relative value.  I have an Ipad (4th generation) and it works great for picking up email and web browsing.  I thought the Ipad would replace my aging laptop, but found myself still needing a laptop for a lot of productivity issues.  The HP Envy has a solid feel and it has ample speed and memory.  It is a little heavy, but that comes with the 17.3 inch size.  Overall, I would rate the laptop 5* had it not come with Windows 8.  I have been a using windows of one version or another for 20 years.  If I was buying a tablet it might be worth my time to figure out what to do with Windows 8, but the software is more cumbersome given the fact that I bought this laptop for productivity and also have an Ipad.  The problem with Windows 8 involves the gestures on the touchpad.  I kept trying to move the cursor and Windows 8 kept changing apps!  If you are looking for a laptop and need the productivity that goes with a keyboard, spreadsheets and word processing, the HP Envy will serve you well.  As for Windows 8, do yourself a favor and download \"Classic Shell\" which will set your laptop up in a Windows 7 like environment.  After that you can learn to use Windows 8 in your spare time but begin using your laptop immediately.

I'm starting up a small business, however, I wanted a laptop I could take with me, and frankly Macs are still too expensive compared to Windows. That being said, I generally like HP products, own several printers, and have been generally impressed by the quality of their PC hardware. The HP Envy dv7 comes with Windows 8, however, and as such, the best I can say is that it just isn't a Mac. Steep learning curve here for this 65 year old man with this iteration of Windows. I've owned an XP before, then jumped to Vista, and finally to Wndows 7, on an HP laptop that my wife now has. So I do have some Windows experience. One of the things I like on my iMac is the top of the screen controls which allows me greater control over what i'm doing. Windows 8 may have something similar, but I couldn't figure it out. I was able, however, to switch back and forth to a more familiar desktop, which I appreciated. But the touchpad was jumpy, and I frequently found myself in an entirely different screen than I had been using just as I was about to save something, or put something in the trash. Frustrating. I liked the volume the Beat speakers put out, but it seemed that there was some distortion in how it was amped out. DVD player did well enough. But nothing outstanding about it. The large tiles on the Windows screen took up too much real estate for me. Though I did like the ability to be able to see some news flashes, as well as emails to me, without opening up the mail itself. I've read other reviewers who have stated that Windows 8 on a touch screen works better, and is easier to navigate. My final thoughts: If you're well acquainted with Windows 7, you might like 8. Patience, however, truly is a virtue, and I simply didn't have enough to keep the Envy. I've opted instead for a new MacPro. It only has a 13.3\" screen, but it is also lighter, as a consequence. It also has 1 terabyte of hard drive space, versus the 750 the Envy comes with. if you're like me and you're used to and like Macs, I suggest you plop down the extra money and buy a Mac instead of a Windows 8 machine.
