{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Budget Ultra For Corporate or Home", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R19ISD57TAV665", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "These ultra portable devices are really useful, but generally expensive. Not this one; it is reasonably priced, so I ordered it to see how well they did. I find it to be quite usable considering the specifications, with excellent BIOS security and other corporate-use features, to have slightly above average battery life with adequate performance, but to be a bit slow for any gaming use.Design:The right side has SDHC card reader, Headphone/Mic combined port, 2 USB 2.0 Ports, a RJ-45 LAN port, and a Kensington security slot. The left side has the power port, a full sized 15 pin VGA port, an HDMI port, and a USB3 port. The bottom has two slits for sound. This device has a touch screen, which is great at the price point. When opened, the screen has a camera port, a camera indicator, and a microphone. The lower portion (below the screen) has the power switch and a multi-light panel that indicates power, wireless, charge level, HDD activity, and caps lock; it is nice that these are on top when the unit is open, to see the status (especially the HDD light). The device features an unusual hinge; the hinge goes around behind the keyboard, reducing the height of the screen when opened. Overall, it is a bit bulkier than most ultras; the end near the screen is thicker. This is due to the hinge, but it also means that the keyboard has a good tilt for typing, and that there is enough depth for a full sized VGA port (most ultras have only HDMI), and a wired network cable on the other. I think it is a good compromise; the unit is fairly light but a bit bulky.  The device includes Asus Webstorage (5gb).Battery:I tested the laptop from a full charge, using the recommended settings (about 35% screen brightness). It lasted around 5 hours with the screen on and moderate use, and I think that the time could be pushed to 6 hours with more efficient settings.Performance:I could tell that this was not a high end ultra. The screen, despite the modest resolution, is very readable from the front, below, and sides, but loses some visibility when viewed at the upper angles. I found that it will run a couple of programs well, maybe three, but after that there was some visible slowness. The performance was strangely variable; at some times it was quite snappy, but other times it seemed to take a while for the hard disk to kick in. Nevertheless, it is perfectly suitable for general word processing and spreadsheet use, and will be fine for basic video viewing, Skype, and that sort of thing. The hard drive is a Hitachi HTS545050A7E680, and runs at 5400 RPM. Most ultras come with only 256 Mb at most (and generally use an SSD), but this drive gives one 500 Mb of storage. However an SSD will be about 6 times faster - and way more expensive. The drive speed and type accounts for some of the slowness. The Keyboard has square keys and is well supported (doesn't creak); I found it easy to use.Sound:Surprisingly for a device of this size, the sound on internal speakers was very good, and the headset output was excellent.Corporate Use:I put in this paragraph because the design has some great features for corporate use. The BIOS will allow the system administrator to lock down just about all of the ports (USB, etc), and encrypt the hard drive. I didn't try these features out because I don't intend to use them. Additionally, the full sized VGA port will be useful for connecting to a monitor at the office, and a full sized wired Ethernet RJ-45 connector will allow for secure use at work or in the motel room. The low price makes it an attractive option for those companies that need to outfit a lot of workers with portable computers.Summary: A really good budget laptop, with decent speed for students and professionals. Highly recommended if you won't be doing a lot of gaming or graphics.See below for more detailed information:-----------------------HDD Benchmarks:Peak 4K Random Write Speed 1.25 MB/s (average)Peak Sequential Read Speed 92 MB/s (average)Peak 4K Random Mixed IO Speed 0.13 (not so good)Peak Sequential Mixed IO Speed 72.4 (not so good)Computer Benchmarks (NovaBench):These tests were done while the device was plugged in.RAM MB/second: 3477CPU Floating Point Operations/Second: 43096210CPU Integer Operations/second 73838078CPU MDS Hashes generated /second: 505059Graphics 3D Frames / Second: 81HDD Primary Partition write speed: 51Mb / secondLikes:+ The touchpad supports windows 8 swipe capabilities. I found that most of them worked, although I could not get the swipe down to close apps from the touchpad.+ 15 pin VGA port as well as HDMI output.+ 1 USB 3 and 2 USB 2. The higher speed USB 3 is very useful.+ Single port for headphones/mike.+ ASUS Smart Gesture - allows three finger move by pages, or to show running apps, or show desktop. This also has option to rotate the screen (although I'm not sure why this is useful on a laptop). By default, this disables the touchpad if a mouse is detected - which is useful.+ Asus Splendid Video Enhancement tech - provides color enhancement modes: Gamma Correction, Vivid, Theater, Soft, My Profile, and Normal.+ The keyboard has a special key to simulate right-click - to the right of the spacebar. While not unique to Asus, it is a nice feature.+ The on line user manual has a very good Windows 8 section with instructions; Asus includes a PDF on the desktop task bar. The manual is well written and useful for new users. The instructions show both touch screen, touchpad, and keyboard. Well done!+ The BIOS has lots of security features: lock USB, HDD, Audio, LAN, and Wireless. Asus supports simple BIOS updates via their Easy Flash utility.+ Asus Live update keeps the drivers and software up to date.+ The device is an attractive brown color with texture, but picks up fingerprints.+ It is very easy to tap the touchpad and get a click.+ The touchscreen is very accurate, even with my big paws.+ Includes Cyberlink Media suite, which includes a desktop burning gadget, an ISO viewer, and Power2Go (burns disks). In some ways this is strange, because the unit has no optical drive (although external ones are fairly cheap).+ There is a USB+ Charging mode, with a limit available that stops charging at a certain percentage. This feature allows the USB port to charge a device while the computer is powered off. This has become somewhat common for ultras; what is different is this capability to restrict the power loss when charging.+ Asus includes a few game titles as part of Asus Vibe!, which has some music and reading as well. (only a few are free).Less Good:- The HDD is slow, even for a 5400 HDD; an SSD would be about 6 - 7 times faster.- The power cord has a large rectangular end that plugs into wall; this will take up a bit of space (as opposed to a \"brick\" which fits easily because it has only the plug in the wall), but it does have a neat built in velcro strap to keep the cord in place.- The top lid extends a bit over the bottom, which makes it a harder to open (there is nothing to grip on the bottom side).- While the unit has a 12 Month warranty, the battery warranty is only 6 months.- Asus divids the drive into OS (186Gb) and data partitions (258 Gb). This really complicates installing games and such, because one will have to be careful where things are installed. It would have been more usable with a simple 500 GB single partition.- The laptop does NOT have Bluetooth, so if you want to add a mouse it will need to be one with a dongle. This omission saves power, but uses up a USB port, and seems a bit strange on an ultra portable.- The laptop is advertised as having the Asus LifeFrame app.  This enhances the camera functions, including the ability to use the webcam as security monitoring device (detects motion and takes a picture), take pictures and videos, voice recorder, and a preview function. Nice stuff - but I didn't see it installed.", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "good laptop, why no reviews?", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2SN15RHU8XGLW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I took a risk and bought this even though I couldn't find any professional or consumer reviews. The new Baytrail N2815 processor is more than fast enough for daily use, and not much slower than my 1 year old Samsung series 9 that cost nearly $1000 (this is for another family member). The hard drive is not advertized as hybrid, but it does boot from hibernate in under 10 secs. The screen is too shiny and reflective, I prefer matte, but for the price, it's OK. Battery life is closer to 6 hours for me, better than the 5 in specs, with wifi on and basic word processing, screen not too bright. The dimensions are almost as large as my Samsung, despite the smaller screen size, and its chunkier and a bit heavier, around 2.8 lbs. Was really looking for a lighter, thinner 11.6 and would have paid 500-600, but nothing out there. This is really a lot of computer for the price. One thing, in sleep mode, it occasionally drains the battery, so I changed settings to hibernate on closing lid, and all is fine.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Sleek like a Chromebook but with more traditional laptop features.", "Author": "Christine", "ReviewID": "R1J1YKLPC8PL83", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been getting familiar with this laptop. It is quite similar to our Chromebook in functionality and size, but with the full functionality of a Windows laptop; you can install programs like word, excel, and photo editing software. While a sleek and simple internet machine, that's what I didn't like about our Chromebook.The operating system is something that takes some getting used to. The apps and programs running in the background were a little confusing to me, but you get used to it over time and it offers a new way to use your favorite websites in a new way, and its easier to look at weather and browse headlines much faster with better access. If you arent sure about this interface, there are ways to basically turn off all the features (apps, etc) and just use the browser.I was initially against the touch screen, but I do use it occasionally to expand or swipe a page. The keyboard and trackpad are perfect, and its simple to adjust the brightness.Coming off a 15.5\" Toshiba, this screen is certainly small. I have to expand the screen so I can see the text. The battery life is quite good as good as say an Ipad. I can get about 6-8 hours. The body is light and compact, the lid closure is smooth and secure. It never gets hot and its virtually silent. The screen is high gloss and can have some glare and shows prints, but a little tilt and you're fine.Overall, I am excited about this computer. This little guy is durable and small with a good battery life - just what I wanted. It has been very reliable and I think it is a very good value.", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "In depth Day 1 Review for  ASUS X200MA 90NB04U5-M02880 11.6-Inch Laptop", "Author": "RogueDC5", "ReviewID": "R1ONPP2B9MLV39", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this product before the description properly depicted the machine that was for sale.I worked with Amazon to correct this; but, I see now that they have the entirely wrong model in the headline. This is for the  ASUS X200MA 90NB04U5-M02880 11.6-Inch Laptop.This model number denotes this is the latest X200MA machine from Asus in white equipped with Intel\u00ae Celeron\u00ae Processor N2815 (1M Cache, up to 2.13 GHz) processor.Windows 8.1 delivers a smooth experience with all of the features included on a more powerful notebook/desktop even in balanced power mode. I cranked up the high performance power mode settings to determine how well the battery coped. BatteryMon reports a discharge rate of around 6200mW with a constant 63% CPU load and 5300mW at idle. In Balanced power mode CPU load peaked at about 47% and discharging at 5500mW, 5% load discharge rate was around 4800mW. Finally, testing in Power saver mode at a 64% load discharge was 5500mW, 4% load discharge was around 4400mW. The battery capacity is measured at 31725mWhI ran a PowerShell command to determine the Windows Experience Score (as it was removed from Windows 8.1) CPU Score 4.6, Direct 3D Score 4.1, Disk Score 5.9, Graphics Score 3.8, Memory Score 5.9, giving a base score of 3.8 due to the mild graphics processing.I ran Crystal Disk Mark 3.0.3 x64 and found with a 1000MB Sequential read test the 6400RPM drive rated at 101.9 MB/s. Write tests at the same 1000MB threshold, averaged 101.6 MB/s. I found this to be more than fair.Pros:> This has the latest Intel Bay Trial N2815 quad core processor boasting a 1.86 GHz clock speed (2.13GHz Boost)> 4GB DDR 1333 MHz SDRAM> It's fairly light weight at just under 3lbs overall. In my experience the screen feels heavier than the base.> 11.6\" Touchscreen with a 1363*768 resolution.> SDXC Card Reader> 500GB 5400RPM 2.5\" HDD> 64-bit Windows 8.1> The $329 price tag.Cons:> It doesn't have a backlit keyboard. (I know, what a thing to complain about.)> ~5hr battery life. It feels as though it should be getting more in this day and age; but, as an entry level machine you really can't expect too much better. It's already nearly double than the previous version of this unit. 5hrs may not last you an intercontinental flight; but, it's not as terrible as you think.> 1366*768 Screen resolution. With 7\" tablets running 1920*1080, it could have been better. Though, again, as an entry level machine I wasn't expecting better.> The $329 price tag. Honestly, with the few corners cut that could have put this machine over the top it seems they could have gotten away with a $299 price tag.Summary:Honestly, for an entry level machine and at nearly $300 you can't expect much. So if your expectations are correct, then you won't be disappointed. While the screen resolution could be a bit better allowing for crisper images, when you are streaming Netflix you wont notice it. It is still delivering an HD experience. It has plenty of power to push 720p video with no issue. While I haven't tested gaming on it, I expect it will deliver well for the casual gamer. Let's be honest no PC gamer is picking this up to play hardcore games on it in the first place.At the end of the day, I bought this with the intention to take overseas, so I could travel light and still maintain a full keyboard with plenty of internal storage for the pictures that we'll be accumulating for the next 2 months in Europe. Once we're back I plan on updating this review with more insight into it's travel ability.So far I feel it's excellent for the price and delivered exactly what I expected.", "Date": "March 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Deal for an Ultra Portable Laptop", "Author": "Erin G.", "ReviewID": "R23EDYGMZXZWK6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the ASUS K200MA as an alternative to my larger 17\" laptop and my cumbersome Samsung Tab 2 (with far less processing power). In relation to work, I must always be able to access our office network remotely, which meant that I was always tied to carrying a device (and a rather large one, in my case). This has proven difficult as I had yet to settle on a portable device that met my needs - until now. Within 3 days of owning this baby, I'm able to slide it into my purse and go, and I barely know it's there.PROS:- Great battery life. A single charge gets me through an 8 hour day with moderate to slightly heave use. As the specs say, it's a 5-6 hour charge, and it has thus far held to that. What this means for me is that I don't have to carry a charger as well as the device - unless I plan on being away for more than an average work day.- Light & easy to carry. In the world of laptops, I'm surprised at just how light this is. I purchased the AmazonBasics 11.6\" Sleeve to go with it, and both fit in my purse and shoulder bag with ease. The weight doesn't weigh me down, and I live in NYC and do a LOT of walking - so I would notice quickly if it became cumbersome.- Starts up quickly and easily. There has been some mention about how much better this laptop would be with a SSD rather than a HDD, and for the most part I agree. However, I'm still impressed with how quickly and smoothly it starts up.- Best when used for running a single program or \"task\". In my case, I'm able to remote-in quickly and easily without lag, and LogMeIn doesn't slow down or freeze as it does on a tablet or some other devices.- Sound is spectacular. I immediately discovered this and downloaded my Amazon playlist for music on the go.- Although I didn't purchase this for the touchscreen, I have to say that it's very responsive which makes it enjoyable and useful.CONS:- This laptop does NOT like video playback. I've tried several methods, including directly connecting it via LAN, and Netflix is jerky at best. Because of that, it's difficult to judge video quality overall, and unfortunately I don't have a peripheral DVD or Blu-Ray player with which I could do more testing. Even YouTube seems to lock and freeze, and you get a sense of buffering when it does play. I've learned to allow videos to load first, but I still find that the issue persists.- Slows down & lags when multitasking. If you are a heavy multitasker, running multiple programs and surfing the web at once, this device will frustrate you. I've learned to allow the laptop to finish loading a large web page or opening a new document before I switch between tasks/programs. As I mentioned before, this is not a big deal for me as this laptop serves a singular purpose and I will not be using this to run more than maybe two programs at once.- ASUS Smart Gesture does not always work as intended. I've defaulted to relying on the touchscreen to interact with the Win8 Start Menu, which I favor anyway. But for some people that may have used this in the past, it might be frustrating.- Total fingerprint magnet. Drives me nuts. I suggest purchasing a screen protector as well - especially if you're going to allow someone with greasy hands to touch the screen.WHO SHOULD BUY THIS LAPTOP:This makes a GREAT secondary device for anyone that needs mobility but has something more powerful as a main device. Moderate use of word processing, email, web, skype, and other lightweight programs work great on this machine. If you have a tablet, but need a little more power (or favor a keyboard) this is for you.WHO SHOULDN'T BUY THIS LAPTOP:If you're a gamer, heavy multitasker, graphic designer, or video editor, this machine will more than likely fall beneath your processing needs.A QUICK NOTE ON WINDOWS 8:I have been a Windows 8 user for over a year. I have dealt with the frustration of adapting to the new OS (without a touchscreen) and the seemingly steep learning curve. However, I now love it, and find it to be such a blessing that my settings are easily shared between computers.The biggest tip that I can offer new Win8 users (aside from starting with 8.1 instead of 8.0) is to remove any and all apps that come preinstalled that you don't need.Next, make sure to customize your start screen by undocking any icons that you don't use, and pushing the programs that you frequently use to the top. I tend to dock my most frequently used programs to the task bar for easy access, but this is all up to you. And if you are lost on where to find your control panel, open the start menu and begin to type \"control panel\" and you will see a search box appear with a list of programs matching your query. From there, you can dock the icon if you like. Follow this process to setup easy access for other programs.", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Something between a Chromebook and a Tablet", "Author": "RST10", "ReviewID": "R29V3U35BMT4TR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you're looking for a low cost laptop that is small enough to be considered a traveler, this is an acceptable option in the price range, and offers some more functionality than a Chromebook. It allows installation of regular Windows programs, while Chromebooks do not. This is one major differentiator in this laptop compared to other small low priced laptops you might consider.How does it look and feel?It looks beautiful. Design has moved a long way in the last few years, especially for less expensive computers. Upon inspection, you could almost mistake this for a Sony Vaio or other high end machine. Open the lid and the screen is shiny-- a touch screen. It also looks beautiful. The keyboard wrist rest is marred by stickers that still come on Windows machines, but easily removed. Next though are some hardware issues that I couldn't fix: The touch-pad is very springy like I have experienced on less expensive laptops. It did not meet my expectations. While it does function, it causes a lot of \"retry\" and less accuracy than even the most typical laptops. It looks very much like a Macbook Air touchpad, but that it is not. The keyboard works acceptably but the buttons there are also quite springy. Luckily I am a mouse person, so plugging in an Anywhere MX fixes my productivity and I move along to exploring the machine.Plugging in my Logitech Wireless Anywhere Mouse MX for PC and Mac, I hop over into the desktop mode, since this is full Windows 8, and not Chromebook OS, or Windows RT, and install the Unifying software for my mouse. It goes fast, and everything about interacting with the OS is fast. Unfortunately though, the hard drive is loud and I can hear it cranking and cranking endlessly. I'm not sure if this is due to system updates on a new machine or why it has so much hard drive activity. I'll monitor this. The system has 4GB of memory and is 64 bit, so it shouldn't be crunching the hard drive so much or so loudly.  I'd normally want to swap that out for an SSD if I had one around.The next thing I did was install Chrome. Simple.  During this process I hear some sounds and surprisingly, the sound is fantastic on this little laptop. A little more testing of the speakers may need to be explored on that later.The other ASUS that I have which is similar is a ASUS VivoBook X202E-DH31T 11.6-Inch Touch Laptop. It's definitely heavier being that it is metal, and does have more of a solid premium feel. While the other is heavy duty, it's heavy and I wouldn't really consider it travel material in the way that this one is light and easy to carry.If it came down to choosing between this device and a Chromebook, I would choose this every time because it has a more premium look & feel, has a touch screen and has the ability to install local applications. I don't necessarily personally prefer Windows 8, but as a mobility device it is more flexible than a Chromebook for nearly the same price, or a small increment more.If I had my say on how it could be better, the only things I'd change would be to improve the feel of the touch-pad clicking, and to put an SSD in there, no matter how small. The hard drive is loud.Otherwise, this is a very viable option when considered against tablets that can cost twice as much, laptops that can cost infinitely more, and Chromebooks which can cost less but offer a lot less flexibility. If you can't spend the money on an ultra book or you have minimal cash to spend on a laptop this option is quite nice compared to what you'd get just two years ago at the same price.If you have any specific questions I'd be happy to answer them in the forum below.", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Windows 8 Netbook vs. Chrome OS Chromebook", "Author": "A. Dent \"Aragorn\"", "ReviewID": "R1BC2GI9NMYT2H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "On the 11-inch form factor, I've been a Chromebook user for almost 2 years now and my happy casual computing experience on a beautiful HP Chromebook 11 and on a Samsung Chromebook before that might have produced some Chromebook bias. To at least reduce it, because I want my reviews to be as bias-free as possible, I forced myself to use this Asus for at least one hour each day for the past several weeks. It wasn't easy and, after all these weeks, I am still a Chromebook user and, nothing personal, I will prefer a good 11\" Chromebook to a Windows 8 of the same size, touch-enabled or not, very much every time. I will explain why.PHYSICALI remember reading someone's remarks on how laptops are expected to 'travel around the world'. I do know a few world travelers but my experience is that most people do not travel around the world very often and my view is that the 11-inch form factor is meant to 'travel around the house' or fit into a backpack pocket and travel to school or to a friend's house. To that extent, each ounce counts because I want to be able to grab my little computer with one hand and move it around easily. When compared to my favorite HP Chromebook, the Asus machine feels heavy and significantly so. The Asus is also a lot thicker and it's a lot more difficult to open it, generally requiring two hands. The HP, on the other hand, is much thinner and feels light as a feather. It opens and closes easily and turns itself on once opened, with no need of more buttons pushing.I can see why, being heavier, the Asus benefits from a rougher, grooved skin because you need a better grip. However, the grooved finish is likely to make it harder to clean and I wasn't able to wipe out fingerprints with a microfiber cloth the way I do it on the HP.The Asus comes with its dedicated charger and it works well. Only the HP Chromebook, while charging faster through its own, can also use very much any phone/tablet charging device to at least keep in going and usually to slowly charge it in an emergency.PERFORMANCE AND SPECSThe Asus has better specs, on paper. The CPU is faster, has more memory, has its own hard disk and a large number of ports: 3 USBs, HDMI, card reader, VGA, Ethernet. But... wait... no Bluetooth, which probably explains the large number of physical ports. And the 802.11 Wi-Fi appears to be limited to 2.4GHz b/g/n and to not work in the 5GHz band. I prefer the HP Chromebook's elegant Bluetooth solution for connecting to various peripherals. Yes, it has fewer ports but, I must confess, except for sometimes using a USB dongle required by a mouse, I never felt a need for a physical port on it. Streamers such as Chromecast and Roku and various online services and 'the cloud' have very much eliminated the need for a physical HDMI port and I wouldn't want to see lots wires or any wires coming in and out of my little 11-inch gadget anyway.The Asus and the HP have similar screen resolutions supported but the Asus has 4GB of RAM, twice as much compared to the HP and it needs it because a computer needs a lot of RAM to support the ultra-heavy Windows 8 OS. Same for CPU speed. The Asus CPU is faster if we are to count cycles but it appears actually slower when in use due to the enormous Windows overhead.The built-in HDD, present in the Asus but not in a Chromebook, while of some (diminishing) utility, adds weight to the Asus machine and makes it run warmer that I prefer - I'm already used to the Chromebooks running silent and cool to notice even the low hum that the Asus HDD makes while churning through the Windows overhead 'stuff' and perhaps constantly checking for malware and file corruption.INTERFACEI actually love Windows 7. I also love the Chrome browser interface I get with Chrome OS. I can't stand Windows 8. It's bloated to the extreme, it's unnecessarily complicated and it appears to be more concerned with enabling Microsoft to suck in all the information it can from you, presumably to sell it to advertisers and who knows who else (ohh.. NSA, I forgot) and to promote its 'properties': Skype, Bing, Internet Explorer... I am not saying that Windows 8 can't be 'easy to use'. Yes, it can if you don't mind Microsoft telling you what's 'good for you' and doing exactly as told. If you want to deviate or customize a little... yes you can but, in my case, I ended up with a Chromebook-like interface, only a lot slower and harder to get to running on a hotter, heavier, noisier little computer.The Windows 8's inherent complexity gets even more annoying with this version's support for touch. It's 'neither here nor there'. The screen touch is poorly and unintuitively implemented in my view and my feeling was that I ended up with a dirty screen for no good reason. I believe 'touch' was an afterthought or a rush in Windows 8 and it shows. For example, when I click the touchpad on the login screen, a unneeded on-screen keyboard is displayed as if Windows doesn't know that it's running on a laptop with a permanently attached keyboard.WHY THIS ASUS?I am not sure if I wanted this as my everyday little laptop under any circumstance. Unless I felt that it was my duty to supply Microsoft and its business partners with loads of my personal data while sacrificing some convenience in the process. I use my 11-inch little computers for casual, in-house activities: watching movies in bed, reading the news while having breakfast, checking my emails, looking up things on Google or the Wikipedia, making quick phone calls, casting some Youtube videos to the big screen TV. All of the above are performed beautifully and easily by the lighter, thinner, cooler, easier to use, prettier and less expensive HP Chromebook. And I don't need to worry about viruses and constant and lengthy patches on it, disk crashes and file corruption or more bloatware stacking on top of pre-installed bloatware slowing everything down to a crawl. Yes, the Asus has a HDD and its sides are poked with various ports but I never felt the need of an HDD for my Chromebook and, the fewer ports that I almost never use the better. Yes, some laptops can and should be used for both 'home and office'. They tend to be significantly more powerful and can be used with add-ons such as 'docking stations' to allow for large screen, mice, full-size keyboards and other peripherals. This Asus should not be imagined as a home/office device.To conclude, this little computer is not 'for me'. I simply can't imagine myself connecting peripherals to a toy-like device made of home use through three (?), doing a wired Ethernet connection or attaching a thick HDMI cable to it. And I don't understand that lack of Bluetooth and its not supporting the 5GHz band for Wi-Fi when even $50 streamers do these days. My Chromebook bias and general dislike of Windows 8 noted, I simply don't like this machine. The ASUS has nice specs that maybe could be put to good use if Windows was replaced with some less bloated OS but, as is, I couldn't justify buying this machine. The \"don't like it\" should normally translate into a 2-star rating but I'm going to rate it as a 3-star, mostly because of the excellent display.", "Date": "April 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "At this price, hard to beat (unless you want a convertible unit)", "Author": "ScOObydoo", "ReviewID": "RRS5VBZEO9YKC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll spare going over all the specifications of this machine, and stick to my real-world feelings about it. As most other reviews mentioned, you get 4GB ram, 500GB HDD and a low powered Celeron running at 2.13GHz.Right off the bat, I can make the recommendation that you may be better off with an SSD version of this laptop, or invest in an SSD and upgrade it yourself. Sadly, once you get into upgrades like that, you are better off starting with an SSD enabled machine right away.That said, for the vast majority of people who just want a basic laptop to surf the web and use Office, this machine can't be beat - the CPU is sufficient for all the basic apps. Don't be tricked into thinking this is a suitable gaming machine, because other than the basics, no high end game will run smoothly on it. The memory is also on the weak side, but again; unless you push it to its limits, you won't have any issues.Build quality is excellent - unlike the cheaper Toshiba units in the same price range, this one doesn't flex or squeak.But my biggest issue with this machine is that for $50 more, you can upgrade to a convertible (laptop/tablet) with a 64GB SSD (or $100 for SSD/HDD combo). http://www.amazon.com/Transformer-T100TA-C1-GR-10-1-Inch-Detachable-Touchscreen/dp/B00FFJ0HUE/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1397754736&sr;=1-1&keywords;=transformer+bookThat machine also has a lower power quad core processor and better battery life - IMHO a much better decision.", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice for its size and price", "Author": "D \"D\"", "ReviewID": "R3DXEV1MHFX7D1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Asus 11.6 ultra-portable is a very small PC, booting up takes a reasonable time but not overly slow.

If you're thinking you'll go with this as an inexpensive route, and perhaps upgrade it later, or maybe make use of an SSD you happen to have on hand, think twice.  I decided that I would go ahead and swap out the HDD with an SSD, but I've found it to be pretty much impossible.You can take the screws off the bottom easily enough, but I have not found a way to pry the bottom section off to get to the internal components without risking cracking the casing.  After some prying, it will snap apart relatively easily at the front, but the back section where the hinges are located just does not want to let go.  I finally decided not to risk it and ended up closing it back up again.Most laptops will allow you to change out the HDD or the memory fairly easily....but not this model.  Very disappointing design, in my opinion...at least for anyone who may want to upgrade it later. I didn't change my original rating, however, because those who consider this a necessary \"feature\" are probably few.  Nonetheless, I thought it was worth being aware of, thus my update.If anyone who owns this unit has had success in this area, I would be thankful for any tips or tricks because I haven't been successful in this endeavor at all.Original review here:I've run this through its paces for about a week now, and overall I really like this notebook. Due to it's size, I really consider it a notebook more than an actual laptop...and ASUS themselves labels it as a notebook on the box it comes in.Here are the main features I like:1. Compact size...very thin and easy to slide into my briefcase2. Impressive screen....no, it's not retina quality, but I have watched a couple of videos on it and the display was not disappointing.3. Ports...two USB 2.0, one USB 3.0, one HDMI out, a full-size SD card slot, plus VGA and Ethernet. And, the usual ports for power and mic.4. 500GB hard drive...plenty for my use.5. Battery life...I got just under six hours before I had to re-charge.6. Quick response time....although it only has a HDD and not an SSD (see below), I found the unit to be quite snappy when navigating the internet.7. Touchscreen...very responsive and cool do work with, especially if you're working off the touchpad off the keyboard and not using a mouse.8. 64-bit system...better utilization of RAM.Here are the not so great areas you should be aware of:1. The hard drive is a bit clunky and slow at start-up.  If you're used to an SSD (which all my other PCs have), it will feel like an eternity.  Just as a side comment, it comes with the hard drive split into two drives...the standard C drive, and another D drive for data storage.2. It is surprisingly heavy for such a thin, compact unit.  You put this in a case with a shoulder strap, and you'll soon know you're carrying around roughly 3 pounds of computing hardware.3. Wish they would have gone with three 3.0 USB ports instead of the two 2.0 ports.4. If you haven't tried Windows 8.1, it takes some getting used to.  I'm not knocking the notebook for having it included (that's par for the course now with new computers).  However, I do find myself clicking on the old Windows 7 interface that I'm used to.  I have one other notebook with Windows 8.1, and over time I am sure I'll move fully over to the new platform.For the price point and for \"standard use,\" I do think it is a good choice despite the concerns I listed above.  It's not for gaming or for HD video editing by any means, but for running Office applications, video viewing, and for surfing the internet it performs nicely.  At a price (as of this writing) of just over $300, I think it's a good value for what you get.If things change as I continue to use it, I will update this review.

My son uses it for a combination of games, educational websites and learning programs. It definitely does everything he wants it to do. He plays Lego games (including the newer Lego Movie and Lego Marvel Superheroes) on it, MineCraft, Club Penguin.A lot of people are complaining about Windows 8, but my 8 year old son has zero issues figuring out how to get around Windows 8. So not sure what that says about the complainers. Windows 8 is an OS that was really built with tablets in mind and I fully admit it doesn't always lend itself well to laptops for certain purposes. However this laptop actually has a pretty responsive touchscreen and it makes navigating Windows 8 easier.Overall all very surprised about the power this laptop possesses. The Celeron processor has come a long way. This one is dual core. The 4GB of RAM is a decent amount. You won't find a cheaper new true laptop out there. Surprisingly it doesn't feel as cheap as its price tag.If you are expecting a workhorse laptop that will be used for business and hardcore gaming then you just aren't being realistic for $300. If you are comparing it to a $1200-2000 MacBook you are just insane. It's a $300 laptop, plain and simple.

I went to a Fry's Electronics store to check out this laptop, and perhaps buy another one.  Fortunately they had one on display.  At first I thought it wasn't having the \"jittery cursor\" issue...until I realized it wasn't plugged in to a power source, but was running off battery.  I plugged the power cord in and, lo and behold, a jittery cursor just like the laptop I ordered.  I'm sure this one had the latest drivers, I've tamed it somewhat using the Elan driver mentioned above.=============UPDATE 051614 -Just some info for other people dealing with this touchpad issue, those who perhaps can't return this laptop.  Using the Elan touchpad driver 11.7.8.5 I have made the issue more tolerable, although still not perfect.  There are settings to change sensitivity of the touchpad which you may find helpful.=============I've never been so disappointed with a computer.  This laptop runs great, has plenty of space and the touchscreen works quite nicely.  Unfortunately the touchpad is a spastic mess.I've never seen a touchpad behave in the manner this one does.  It's jittery, jumpy, spastic, erratic.  You hold your finger still, and it jumps and shakes about.  Trying to stop the cursor on things is far more difficult.  This doesn't happen all of the time, making it a nightmare to diagnose, and it seems worse when it's plugged in.  But I've seen it happen while running on battery as well.

Johnson", "ReviewID": "RVBBC9O3IYMUG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this because I had 2 laptops go out on me in a matter of days. Both of which were from 2006. I wanted something extremely mobile, fast, cheap, and has a touchscreen. I like the specs on \"ultrabooks\" but the price is just out of the question for me. I did quite a bit of research and eventually narrowed it down to either this or the asus TA100 convertable tablet. For my needs I felt I would not be using it as a tablet, but as a netbook with it docked 95% of the time.Reasons I bought this over the TA100-$100 cheaper than 32GB w/500GB HDD (which bought a 120GB SSD)-Baytrail celeron vs baytrail atom (celeron is more powerful CPU and especially GPU)-less cramped keyboard-3 usb ports vs 1-full linux (ubuntu 14.04) support of the box (disable secureboot in bios on startup)-4GB ram upgradeable to 8GB-64bit vs 32bit UEFI (most people won't care, or notice, but for those things that need it, should be noted)-upgradeable internal storeage (possible with HDD dock, but not onboard)-decent touch padsome things that you loose-3-4 hours battery life per charge-slightly bulkier design than T100 w/ HDD dock-bluetooth-ability to be a tablet w/o dock-MS office student license keyThe screen size difference of 1 1/2 inches is probably my least concern but I can't say it's a possitve or a negative, just different.Very first thing I did after getting this was removed the 5400RPM HDD and replaced with a samsung evo 120GB SDD and installed ubuntu 14.04 on it because I would rather die than be stuck with windows 8. It should also be mentioned that ubuntu or windows 7 on the TA100 is a non-starter for lots of different reasons. Mostly drivers, or incompatiblity with 32bit UEFI. So unless you really don't care or actually like windows 8, then you're stuck with that on the TA100 for the foreseeable future.Computer cold boots in less than 10 seconds, is super snappy, plays games like minecraft on slightly above minimum settings. Installed starbound and was playable, but not great. Haven't tried too many native games, but if you install linux and steam you can stream your games over wifi from a windows gaming desktop. I played a game of league of legends, some skyrim, and diablo 3, all of which were in highest settings on my desktop, looked great, fairly fluid and not horrible lag, definitely enjoyable for sure. So getting this as a true extension to a gaming desktop is really great.general computing performance is great, exactly what you would want. Fast browsing, fast application load times (with SSD) no lag, just a great 2014 netbook with close to ultrabook performance and form factor. It gets warm (maybe 100 degrees F) only had the fan go on once during gaming testing and only knew it was on by feeling the air. Comfortable to have on your lap for extended use.my only complaints is that it's not wireless n, and bluetooth would have been nice but with 3 usb ports, just get a micro dongle. If I didn't have to disasemble the freaking thing to get to the HDD or battery/ram it would have been nice, but how often do you need to do these things? All in all, fantastic purchase, would have paid $500 for this with a 120/250GB SSD, but at $300 and the ability to do the upgrade myself with the savings, plus I get a 500GB out of the deal to slap into a external enclosure is a great deal IMO.typed this review from this, and the keyboard is fantastic.", "Date": "May 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice travel Laptop and much better performance after upgrading HDD to SSD", "Author": "R.

That's a significant amount in light of the ubiquitousness of cloud storage.There is an ethernet jack, often missing from similar portables, and of course Wi-Fi, although no Bluetooth.

Every time that touch keyboard pops up on the touchscreen just above the physical keyboard, my mind boggles.  Why?  I also spend a lot of time starting over in touch menus and going through the same sequences again and again.Overall, a decidedly unexciting laptop, but one that is very serviceable, about what one would expect in this price range.
