The cherry on top of all this trouble was Lenovo's JOKE of a \"repair\" depot, after spending 1.5hrs with tech support, including them remotely connecting to my machine and adjusting all the settings of the touch-pad and downloading different drivers AND waiting 10 days to get my laptop back, the laptop did the EXACT SAME THING right out of the box when I got it back.  The repair depot \"tech\" noted on the paper that he fixed the problem by \"resetting touch-pad to factory settings\"??????!!!!!  I called LENONO's repair depot and within 2 minutes the tech was asking me to return the laptop so they could replace the touch-pad...i said WHY DIDN'T YOU GUYS DO THAT WHEN I SENT IT BACK THE FIRSTTIME??\" he replied \"I'm not sure\".I have since returned the laptop back to Amazon for a full refund and purchased a new HP ENVY DV6 that is beyond meeting my expectations.Do your homework before buying, read these reviews and learn from the rest of us.Happy Hunting", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "big mistake - big regret", "Author": "vegihiker", "ReviewID": "R2CVQNKKS8257G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this laptop was my first and last lenovoif all you want to do is park it on a desk -  you'll probably be fine - but if you want all the portability features of a laptop - skip this one!After just 6 weeks - here's what I've encountered1.  When the battery gets low - the wifi shuts off and does not turn back on once plugged in/charged. The trouble-shooters tell you to \"turn the wifi switch on\" ... there IS NO wifi switch!!2.  After a couple of weeks - the battery stopped charging up all the way - it would charge up to 50% - and display \"plugged in, not charging\" - none of the power-management options included a means of shutting this off. I had to call Lenovo support - they blamed it on my installing software (of course) and walked me through uninstalling the old Win 7 power management utility and downloading a Win 8 one. My u510 shipped with Win 8 ... so ... ??3.  Now that I have the new \"win 8\" power management utility - the settings seem stuck on \"max performance\" no matter what I do - so I fly through my \"5 hour\" battery in under 2.75 hours. Lenovo tech support has no solution for this4.  It took 3 phone-calls and a slew of e-mails to the Lenovo extended warranty department to get them to give me my full 2 year extended warranty ... they kept setting the expiration date of my warranty to nearly 3 months BEFORE I even purchased the laptop!! I eventually got this fixed - but why was this even ever an issue??5.  There is an extremely LOUD low battery beep that starts beeping ever 3 or so seconds once the battery is down to 10%. THERE IS NO WAY TO SHUT THIS OFF!!! Not in windows, not in BIOS ... you're stuck with this laptop making this obnoxious racket. And - so helpful - even if you close the lid - it keeps beeping. You have to actually shut it down to make the beeping stop. Lenovo tech support just says \"we can't do anything about that\".So - to sum up This laptop is ...not particularly fastnot particularly well pricednot particularly well madenot at all a good laptop for mobile tech workers using public spaces (coffee shops, libraries) - or possibly going to drain the battery in front of clientsI've been using laptops since 94 and have used Toshibas, HP's, Dells and have never had any of these issues on any of those brands.bottom line: the Lenovo u510 is the MOST INCONVENIENT laptop I have ever owned!

Granted the design has bee completely stolen from Apple. It has really nice hardware inside and is priced better than an equivalent mac. The only gripe I have with it is the version of windows it comes with - 8. It wasn't even installed on the SSD drive. I tried contacting customer service about it, as I didn't have a WINDOWS CD included with it, just the windows 8 key on the bottom. The representative was very rude and typed super slow, they tried to sell me a recovery cd for $60 so I can reinstall windows on the SDD instead. When I requested to chat with a manager the representative got even more rude and demanded my name and telephone number. I resolved the problem using other means if you know what I mean, but this is completely unacceptable behavior. Looking at the Lenovo forums, I noticed I wasn't the only one screaming bloody murder about their support.Again Laptop is great, but customer support is terrible, that's why 2 stars are off, I don't want to even imagine what's going to happen if I have a hardware problem with this device in the future.", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worst Touch Pad ever....", "Author": "Pras", "ReviewID": "R1XQQUJNEYDQ4I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I tried two models of this laptop - one with ELAN touchpad and one with Synaptic. Synaptic one was kind of OK, but the ELAN one was horrible. I don't know why Lenovo won't recall this product instead of letting customers buy, return and give a very bad review. This laptop is is useless with this touchpad (otherwise a nice pick).

I was an IBM employee and own IBM stock as such I get discounts on products including Lenovo. When IBM sold Lenovo their PC business the products were being built to IBM standards. Today the chinese who own Lenovo are making chinese fishing boats, sometimes known as Junks. The touch pad is twitchy, the wifi drops out on a regular basis, the only fix is to turn airplane mode on and off run the troublshooter, restart the Laptop and then rerun the troubleshooter. Twice a week. The laptop turned off a month after buying it and would not come back on. I bought an in home repair warranty at that point which is retroactive to purchase date from lenovo. Guy came out replaced the motherboard, seemed to work fine until he put the last screw in and the issue came back. He took the laptop back apart and found that the screw presses on a cable. He made sure the cable was properly in the channel designed for it. The problem has not come back yet. All of these issues point to sorry Quality control (my wife is a quality engineer)and design. Having a screw press on a power cable is a poor design. When I called about the power issue with the warranty information the \"technician\" on the phone told me it would not go into effect for 30 days. It clearly states on the Lenovo site that it is retro to the purchase date. I had to make several more calls,get tranferred several times until that was handled. Wish I had bought an Apple instead. My son has an Apple and it works great. The Lenovo came with windows 8, worst operating system ever.

I've reformatted the hard drive to no avail (so it's a hardware problem), but it broke 2 months past their 1 year warranty, so tech support is no help to me.

The store from where I purchased it sent me another one, though.It is sleek and sturdy, but a bit heavy (although, lighter than the computer I replaced). The touchpad is a bit awkward, as the \"buttons\" that you are supposed to push are also touch-sensitive; so, when you try to click on something, the cursor moves. I purchased a wireless mouse to make up for this.Lately, like many other reviewers (on this and other websites), I have had wireless issues. After a couple of hours of usage, the wireless card goes out. The computer sometimes reads my network but is unable to connect and, other times, cannot read my network at all. My other devices connect to the network without any problem; so, I know the issue is with the computer. The fix is to shut off the wireless card by turning on \"airplane mode,\" wait 15 seconds and turn it on again.

Just to highlight some of them that most concerns me: (i)Win8 factory installed in the HD disk instead in the SSD disk; (ii) when the battery goes away, the system shut down the wifi and there is no way to turn it on again except rebooting; (iii) trackpad doesn't work, I decided to buy a cheap Logitec mouse instead to get nuts.Lenovo lost a chance to do amazing.
