{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Touch-screen, Easily Upgradeable, Looks Good, Feels Solid", "Author": "YSC", "ReviewID": "R7631RLNYYM0D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Likes:- The black textured plastic finish is very nice, and is used as top-side panels (top cover, palm rest). I like this better than the two-tone metallic finish since it looks more integrated, more business-like, and less as a \"tack-on\" like the metallic sheet accents in the 15RM. It also means the side and bottom plastic isn't a silver painted variety, but a hard ABS plastic that when scratched, will stay the same color and harder to detect. In my opinion, it is more practical and unpretentious, and the textured finish makes it no less aesthetically appealing--and in my opinion more so--than the metallic trim edition.- Windows 8 is apparently a very touch-centric OS. I suspect that may have caused some initial complaints and awkwardness with mouse and keyboard users (myself included). Having a touch screen really alters the experience. It's really more like a tablet with a keyboard than a PC with touch screen. In that sense, it is also more intuitive for users who are not tech-savvy or uncomfortable with computers. With a fairly large and vibrant glass touch screen, this laptop offers the full Windows 8 experience. I know this is a controversial issue, but while I still miss the start button, I grew to like the user experience, as did my family--especially my parents who were really uncomfortable of PCs in the past.- The overall build quality feels solid, with hard ABS plastic tub as the main chassis that's fairly durable. The touchpad is very responsive, and the keyboard has a good tactile feel. The glass touch screen apparently have enhanced the lid's rigidity as well, reducing flex which can often be an issue with large screen plastic shell laptops.- The i3 may seem like a low end processor, but to my understanding the i5 offers in addition \"turbo\" mode and virtualization. The former offers a small gain (a few hundred MHz in the lower end models) in clock speed for single thread applications (such as encoding), which isn't terribly common in daily tasks that are often multithreaded. The virtualization is used for Virtual Machines, XP Mode, VMWare, etc., which I suspect is probably not terribly useful for most of us. In that sense it's really the best bang for the buck, and it excelled at daily tasks like browsing, movies, Office, and the like. It handled everything we threw at it very smoothly.- The battery on this machine actually lasts longer than I expected for this screen size. With around medium usage like playing music and video, I was able to get 3-4 hours. If I try to use it mostly to encode a video or do some 3D gaming, I could still get 2-3 hours. It would last longer, such as 4-5 hours, if you were just doing light tasks like office or browsing.- The onboard Intel 4000 integrated graphics isn't the fastest or the most powerful, but other than 3D gaming, it really handles everything else with aplomb. It plays full HD videos without any issues, and the HDMI out can also let you connect to a larger monitor and TV with even higher resolution than the laptop monitor. It worked with my 27\" 2560x1440 monitor just fine. Connect a bluetooth/usb keyboard and mouse, it can be an affordable and versatile energy efficient desktop as well.- It's easily upgradeable. This cannot be overemphasized especially seeing how the \"ultrabook\" concept often eschew upgradable ease for aesthetics. Both the hard drive and the two SO-DIMM memory slots are easily accessible through the bottom hatch cover with a few screws. It can house two SO-DIMM chips so the maximum capacity would be 16GB of RAM (it comes installed in both slots with 2GB each). The SATA drive can also be replaced with a SSD drive easily as well.- Good Connectivity- comes with bluetooth built in, something that can be appreciated when there are more bluetooth enabled portable devices/peripherals than ever: mice, keyboards, speakers, etc. 4 USB Ports (2 of which are USB 3.0) and HDMI makes for very updated connectivity. The built in multi-card reader as well as DVD burner drive also wouldn't hurt.Some Potential Issues:- The aforementioned black textured top cover (on the back of the top lid and palm rest), while looking more expensive than it is, still manages to pick up and show oil mark from palm where it is handled. Similar issue with the touchpad and palm rest area. The black just shows oily smudges and lint/dust a bit easier. However, that largely depends on how it is used. A little cleaning easily takes care of that.- It's not the most portable computer at over 5 pounds. With a 15.6\" screen, you probably shouldn't expect it to be. This is probably more suitable for infrequent relocation where you get a larger screen and full size keyboard as a trade-off.- The screen resolution is only 1366x768 (good enough for 720p), with no optional upgrades apparently. In the era of ultra high resolution displays (e.g. Retina), that's probably going to be a gripe for some. People would probably expect at least a full HD (e.g. 1920x1080) display, especially given the large 15\"+ screen size. However, given the price point and touch screen, the resolution isn't unreasonable. It is suitable enough for most daily tasks, and the lower resolution density makes for larger text and pictures for much easier viewing (particularly for seniors). There is always the option of connecting to an external monitor via HDMI, as mentioned above.- The Intel HD4000 integrated graphics isn't good for 3D gaming, so you probably shouldn't look at this if you plan on playing 3D games with it, unless you can stand lowest rendering settings with low framerates. 2D games, however, are very smooth and easily managed.- The included 500GB hard drive is a typical 2.5\" 5400RPM drive. Like its storage capacity, it's adequate, and hasn't presented me with any issues with performance or responsiveness. One should probably not expect better at this price point. It may feel slow to some (especially if you are used to desktops with 7200RPM drives or even SSDs), yet it does have the advantage of reduced heat and power consumption over 7200RPM hard drives. If speed is really a priority, SSD is the way to go (at a premium), and can be easily upgraded.- No D-Sub VGA port. It should probably be phased out in modern laptops anyway. This may be an issue only if you use legacy products with only VGA support, such as older presentation projectors. However, a HDMI to VGA adapter is inexpensive and easily solves that.Notes:Dell has been a solid choice for budget laptops for years. I personally think this is a great iteration that doesn't feel cheap, but looks professional and almost expensive. The touch screen really completes the included Windows 8, and makes for an intuitive user experience that may be worth your giving it the benefit of the doubt. This is not meant to be a high end laptop, so if you tend to have CPU or graphic intensive tasks (e.g. video rendering, 3D Modeling, 3D gaming, etc.), or want something ultra-portable, you should probably look to pay more for something else. (In my opinion, if you really need ultra-portability, tablet/smartphones is probably the way to go). Yet if you don't carry around your laptop often, or just want something more efficient and smaller than desktop PC, without sacrificing too much power and comfort: this Inspiron offers easy upgradability, vibrant touch-screen, decent battery life, solid construction, and good performance. If you don't mind the bulk, this is a very affordable, functional and solid laptop that will easily satisfy.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect Everyday Computing", "Author": "EuReka", "ReviewID": "R3OOII4XX7HL65", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop really packs a punch! It will do all of the web surfing, email, itunes, music, etc that you can throw at it! I've even done a little low end gaming and a little video editing on it and it even works smoothly for that! I'm gonna try to touch a little on each aspect of the laptop and how it has performed to me so far..WebcamPretty Solid, It appears to be better than the iPhone cameras and my old laptop one, or so say my callers :PHard DriveNice and speedy, is not a 7200rpm though but I'm sure people don't move copious amounts of data on their laptops though.DVD BurnerNo blanks, burns fast and isn't as annoyingly loud as my previous laptops drive.Media Card ReaderA great feature to have, It works and no more draining my cameras battery life in order to get pics off of it!ProcessorIs a new Core i3 dual core and this beats my old laptops core2duo hands down. Much snappier, never lags and even works great to render some small videos, I was surprised how well it performs compared to my farm more expensive Core i7 in my gaming rig I just built.RAM4GB? That's more than you will ever need in an \"Everday Lappy\"Windows 8I was so worried about trying Win8 - The new start menu and everything seemed like such a turn off but it's actualy fairly pleasant because you have a touchscreen so it really does feel more natural. Just like Win7 - Win8 is smooth and very efficient unlike that \"Vista\" mishap *cough*TouchscreenThe screen is very bright, crisp and clear. Give it a nice wipe down with a microfiber at the end of each day in order to prevent smudging and fingerprinting. It's very responsive and it smooth to the touch as well. Something I never thought we would see in this price range for awhile!Audio/SpeakersIt's okay, again it is a laptop so don't expect excellent quality bass and everything with the built in speakers. For everyday use and some light gaming it is more than adequate though.Battery LifeLaptop seems to be energy efficient, I am getting at least 5-6 hours with surfing use on a single charge. Charging time is pretty snappy as well.TouchpadSmooth but a light textured feel to it so there is no \"skidding\" of your fingers when you are trying to scroll fast, Responsive.BluetoothI do not own any bluetooth devices but this should be handy for those of you who like the wireless headphones or have that wireless data cards.WirelessThis thing gets some pretty strong signal range. Our router is kept up in the attic and I get full signal anywhere in the house, and even out to the edge of our property in both the front and back yards. It's been nice sitting in the shade outside as summer winds down and be on skype calls or the like outside.Build QualityWeighs in at around 5 pounds, Have a nice solid feel to it although it is made with a plastic shell. The screen has a little flex to it, It's fairly thin but it shouldnt be a problem unless you really \"try\" to flex it. I would imagine that it would survive many falls from your lap onto the floor though. The outside texture/design is pretty cool too. Nothing fancy, but it's better than just a smooth and plain texture.GraphicsThe build in Intel graphics look pretty sweet. Playing some of my DVD and Bluray collection on the laptop looks amazing. It can even be used as a \"player\" when hooked up to your HD tvs via the HDMI connection. This plays my favorite games at around medium settings with shadows turned off (shadows are the hardest on the graphics processors to process) and it has performed well even after hours of playing.Software/BloatwareJust say no, Make it a habit to remove all of the factory included software. :]", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nicely done", "Author": "Dr. XYZ", "ReviewID": "R1UJ8L21H2Y3J7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being a Windows 8 hater really forced me to carefully choose a laptop for a friend as Win7 laptops are sparse and usually only the over priced models are available.With that said, this laptop has a touch screen, which is pretty much required to make the best use of Win8,  it has the ivy bridge processor which is best for power management.

This 15\" Inspiron is an updated replacement. Since I've used Apple products since the mid-80's, as well, the Windows 8 OS didn't really give me much trouble, although I still use my Windows 7 desktop configuration for most things.  As far as I can tell the touchscreen function is mostly fluff but it's handy some of the time.Things I like:  It's light weight but still has a large touch screen, the battery life is pretty good, it doesn't get hot, and I can still run my old photo processing program from earlier Dells.Things I don't like: The Windows 8 search function for the computer is not as useful as the old one- it really doesn't let you search the entire computer. The left click key on the touchpad is extremely noisy and doesn't have the same feel as the other keys. Often, if the cursor gets near- not on- the right side of the screen the touch menu pops out and keeps coming back as you repeatedly dismiss it until the cursor is safely moved away.  Its a hassle and a distraction.Other than the above, the Inspiron works well enough on its own but whenever Microsoft, Firefox or Thunderbird has an update it suddenly starts behaving erratically- freezing up, grinding slowly at loading, sometimes the cursor disappears altogether and the touchscreen doesn't respond. My email system will go belly up.  A lot of this is Windows 8, no doubt, but it's part of this laptop so Dell gets some of the blame for it, too.In the end this is an adequate, inexpensive laptop that does everything I need but it also has some aggravating quirks that my 5 year old Studio 17 did not suffer from.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best touchscreen Laptop under 500!!!", "Author": "Chad", "ReviewID": "R48TLG927QRYC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are like me and you research a product so much that it annoys your wife then I have done all the hard work for you. I started out wanting a laptop under 400. Don't waste your time there isn't much there. I wasn't sure if I needed a touchscreen. If you are running windows 8 that is a definite yes despite what the best buy guy told me. There are multiple Dell laptops out there, some touch screen and some not. What's the difference besides price?This laptop is practically the same except it's a Pentium processor. Don't get it. It's a good processor but the i3 is much faster and more energy efficient which equals better battery life. Dell Inspiron 15 i15RVT-3762BLK 15.6-Inch Touchscreen Laptop (Black)This laptop is also almost the same with a Pentium processor. Don't get it. Would you rather have a \"new\" 1989 Honda accord or a \"new\" 2013 Honda accord? Similar processors with i3 being more efficient. Dell Inspiron 15 (3521) i15RV-6143BLK 15.6-Inch Touchscreen Laptop (Black Matte with Textured Finish)Like I said before, just get the touch screen. It incorporates really well with everything. With the swipe of a finger you can switch from Microsoft word over to internet which was great when writing my metallurgy paper this morning. Also, the keyboard is really nice which looked a bit strange to me in the pictures. The keyboard is spill resistant and the number key on the side is really handy. The optical drive will burn a cd to your computer very quickly. The battery is great, I unplugged at 8am this morning and with the screen on bright using internet by Wi-Fi and writing a paper all day I plugged back in at 1pm with it showing 17% left which it showed as 1 hour remaining. The speakers are good, they do not distort at high levels. The screen really doesn't show fingerprints excessively as I have been touching it multiple times and have yet to see any streaks. The touch screen is very responsive, accurate, and easy to use. I am coming from a 2006 Gateway laptop which died finally. So I would recommend this dell without actually favoring dell in the first place. there was another laptop just like this one for $50 more that had a smooth metal looking finish but I would skip out on the extra charge as this one is actually very nice. It does not take long to boot up, but if it is sleeping it will boot in less than 2 seconds which is pretty cool. It comes with an hdmi, two 2.0 usb, two 3.0 usb, a multi card reader, and an optical drive which is awesome. Keep an eye on Asus if researching those. Most do not have optical drives. This computer is light and does not throw much heat. Am I missing anything? I love it definitely recommend it to everyone.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this Laptop!  High Quality and Easy to Use...", "Author": "ThisThatNEverything \"thisthatneverything\"", "ReviewID": "R3BF0LO30LCQJU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My Laptop & Windows History:Prior to getting this laptop I'd been using my previous one for about 4 years.  It was an ASUS and had Windows 7 on it.  I liked that one but it was getting old and outdated, full and slow.  It was time for a new one.  Earlier this year I purchased a Samsung laptop that came with Windows 8.  The laptop was horrible.  It was slow and cheaply made.  I ended up returning it after just a few days.  Since this was my first experience with Windows 8 it left a bad impression in my head.  I thought my problem with that laptop had something to do with that.  When we returned that laptop we told Customer Service that it was like taking a laptop from 10 years ago and slapping a new title on it and installing Windows 8 on it.  It was really primitive.This Laptop with Windows 8:I was a bit nervous getting this Dell laptop since it comes with Windows 8 but that's pretty much all you can find on the market today.  Turns out that I was nervous for nothing.  This laptop rocks!  Although I'm not a huge fan of Windows 8, it's certainly not as bad as I thought it was.  It's easy to maneuver around it.Size and Keyboard Layout:Bigger is not always better in my findings with laptops.  I do a ton of typing so the keyboard layout is very important to me.  I find the layout on the 15.6\" laptop very comfortable and spaced out just right.  It's not too compact making it difficult to type and it's not too spaced out that you have to reach a bit more than you'd like.  They number pad and the arrows are really great on this laptop.  On my ASUS laptop I hit the wrong button often and my wrist was a little uncomfortable when using the number pad.  The layout on this laptop is just perfect for me in every way.Other thoughts:Speed- I think this laptop is very fast.  And I love how you can boot it up and you're good to go in less than a minute.Picture Quality- The picture looks great on this laptop.  With that Samsung laptop that I had, the picture quality was awful.  I have absolutely no complaints about the graphic quality on this laptop.  It's very high quality.Touch Screen- I've never used a Touch Screen laptop before so I wasn't sure how good it would be.  What a great feature.  It works really well and always does what I'm telling it to do.  I haven't had any issues with it and although I thought I'd have fingerprints or smudges all over the screen I don't.  I love this feature.Space- 500GB is the minimum that I wanted in a laptop so this is a great size for me.  Really good for the price.CD / DVD Drive- A CD Drive is not an option for me, it must have one.  There are so many laptops out there nowadays that no longer have this feature.  I was very happy to see that this laptop has it.  It works great too.  On my previous laptop I was constantly accidentally opening the CD Drive.  This isn't a problem on this laptop.  It stays closed.  You have to push a small little button in just the right way to get this one to pop open.  This is a plus for me.Textured Finish- Although I like the feel of the textured finish on this laptop, it leaves way too many fingerprints.  It's difficult to clean them off too.  When the laptop is just lying there closed it doesn't look too great because it always looks like there are greasy fingerprints all over it.  Our hands are always clean when we use the laptop so it's just the oils from your skin that leaves marks.  This would probably be the only thing that I would complain about with this laptop.Solidness- When I had the Samsung laptop for a few days I noticed that it felt empty.  It just felt like an empty plastic shell.  This laptop feels solid and it's not a cheap plastic feel.  This laptop feels how a laptop should feel.Getting started- Right out of the box I found this laptop to be fast and easy to set-up.  I had it up and running in probably 5-10 minutes.  It's a very simple set-up process.Overall I absolutely love this laptop and I would highly recommend it.  It's a great everyday laptop that I find to be very high quality.", "Date": "September 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great everyday laptop for the money", "Author": "Chicago Book Addict", "ReviewID": "R39WUYA3VQ3LO1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My Apple laptop is on its last legs so I got this as a replacement.  Overall, it doesn't have some of the bells and whistles of the Apple (which is to be expected based on the substantial price difference), but is a solid laptop for someone on a budget and functionally, is sufficient for most of what the average user will need a laptop for.Aesthetics:Overall I liked the black and thought the textured finish was an interesting touch.  It does give the laptop a distinctive look.  The plastic case also seems sturdy and like it will be able to stand up to wear and tear.  However, it doesn't necessarily have a luxurious look to it like you get with an Apple.  Personally, I prefer the look of the metal on the MacBook Pros although it can get easily dented. (Again, however, this is a tradeoff based on the price, and was something I expected.)Performance:Overall, I have found the speed of this computer to be good.  It doesn't generally get hung up, even when I have multiple programs open, which is a plus.  It also works well when gaming.  I've been playing The Sims 3 with expansion packs on this and haven't had any issues with the game crashing or lagging.  The only thing I have noticed is that from time to time, the mouse seems to get hung up even when the keyboard is responsive.  I haven't quite figured out what causes this, but thankfully it only seems to happen from time to time.Functionality:Overall I find the functionality of the computer to be good.  The Windows interface is taking some getting used to since I have almost exclusively been a Mac user for a few years.  I'm not sure everything is laid out in the most intuitive manner, but do enjoy the home screen.  However, after playing around with it for a couple weeks it does become increasingly easier to get the hang of.  (Especially when I played around with the mouse settings since some of the side swiping motions were tripping me up.)  I still prefer the Mac interface over this, but haven't found it to be prohibitively difficult to use.  My only real nit is that I have less say when it updates the Windows 8 software than I felt I did on a Mac.  Here it does give you some warning the update is coming but when it updates there seems to be no way to delay it from happening at the exact moment the computer deems it necessary.  Unfortunately this has been at times when I needed the computer at that exact moment and the updates seemed to be a few minutes long so it was quite annoying.It is important to note that this computer doesn't come with much of any preloaded software so unless you will use this only for web browsing you'll need to plan to purchase other software and should factor that cost in on top of the purchase price of the laptop.  There is some basic photo editing software, a trial version of Office (which you will have to pay for at the end of the trial), and a IE browser.  Thankfully, if price is an issue there are increasingly a lot of great freeware programs available on the internet that offer similar functionality to more expensive programs like office or Photoshop.I also love that this computer makes it easy to connect to other devices.  The # of USB ports has been sufficient for my use and I love that there is already a built in media card reader.  It makes it very convenient when I want to upload pictures to my computer.Overall, I think this laptop is a great value for the money and good for everyday computing needs.

After months of research, I kept coming back to the Dell Inspiron.Let me tell you, I am not disappointed! The price was great, especially being touch screen, Windows 8, plenty of storage with an i3 core. The look and feel is wonderful, comfortable keyboard and spacing.Yes, it leaves finger prints. I'm a bit of a stickler when it comes to finger prints, but I've found that a soft, dry cloth wipes them up good. The screen also shows lots of prints, but if you're used to a smart phone, then you'll get used to the prints on this too. Again, soft, dry cloth cleans it up nicely. I don't know if I want to get a screen protector. I don't want it to mess with the feel of the touch screen.Touch screen is nice and I found it easy to navigate. It's a little touchy, can open apps you don't mean to open, but all trial and error. It glides nicely and has a ton of features and uses, personalize it for what you want, extra storage for what you don't need on your start page.I've downloaded iTunes, more pictures than I care to admit, games, etc and she is still moving quickly and quiet! It's really quiet! Starts up within 2 min. Updates took about 5 min.As a single mom, I needed a reliable and affordable laptop to fit my needs for work, my kids school needs, and of course, all the fun we like to have with it as well. Did I mention it comes with 3 or 4 USB ports, hdmi, and a CD/DVD player? What's not to love?!?! I may not be a tech guru, but I'm no dummy either.

Harley", "ReviewID": "R3RUCXCOCJFRV6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I scooped up one of these up during a Black Friday lightning deal.  I like it a lot, but it's definitely a budget laptop.  The build is all plastic and gaps around the edges suggest they are banging these things out at a rabid pace.  When I plug in the AC adapter, I can see the metal of the adapter end through the gap between the outer and inner shell.  The touchscreen works well for the most part, although there were a few occasions where responsiveness was less than optimal and I resorted to the mouse. Touch reponsiveness is not as smooth and fluid as with a tablet, which I find odd.  You would think if they can get touch responsiveness perfect on a wafer thin tablet, it should be a slam dunk on a full-blown PC. The 1366x768 resolution is sufficient but far from pretty. It's strictly a utilitarian resolution. The screen is also a little dim and has less contrast than I prefer.The gesture capable mouse is okay but like the touchscreen, seems to be hit or miss at times. Sometimes I can tap the mousepad to make a selection, other times it won't respond unless I tap it multiple times or just click the mouse button instead of tapping the mousepad. Wifi connects reliably but I haven't tested Bluetooth yet.  The keyboard feels sturdy and I like the key response.  The keyboard also has a full number pad.  Performance is about what you'd expect from a core i3 budget laptop.  While obviously not as snappy or quick as an i7 in morre intense applications, I hardly notice a difference light tasks such as web browsing and office applications, which are the only things most home users do anyhow.  As far as gaming, the casual game crowd, those who primarily play games Candy Crush, Bejeweled, Plants vs Zombies, and Maplestory will be happy.  You definitely shouldn't buy this is you're looking for something to play a game like Call of Duty Ghosts, forget it. The same goes for video editing and rendering.  Light photo editing is possible but if you plan to run a program like Photoshop, I'd definitely recommend bumping the RAM up to 8GB first.  Boot time is about 20-30 seconds, which is a bit slow for Windows 8 but I wonder if it's partially due to the Dell software.  Speaking of software, Dell thankfully didn't overload the PC with bloatware. In fact, the only unwanted programs I uninstalled were trials for Mcafee Internet Security and Office 365.  There are a few Dell specific utility programs for backup, retore and support that I left installed. A word of warning, the Dell software started acting flaky after I upgrading to Windows 8.1.  For example, I had to reinstall the Dell backup application before I was able to burn recovery DVDs.  So, my advice is to burn your recovery DVD's and using Dell's support application to check for updated software before upgrading to Windows 8.1.The Dell 15R is a decent budget laptop.  I am very satisfied with the value I received at the lightning deal price.  At 30% off, I basically paid little more than the cost of a new netbook or Chromebook for this laptop. However, at the normal price of close to $500, I would strongly suggest exploring and considering other options.  With a little searching and patience, you could likely find a better bargain.  For instance, a Lenovo P400 Touch with 6GB RAM, (dual-core) i5 processor with turbo boost and 1600x900 resolution was recently selling for nearly the same price as this Dell. I have to be completely honest and admit that I likely would not have purchased this laptop if not for the lightning deal.  However, for $150 less, I can live without an dual-core i5 CPU, a few extra pixels and 2gb of extra RAM.  So my three star rating is for this PC selling at full price.  For the price I paid, it's four stars easily, but I can't rate based on a sale price that lasted mere seconds.  My star rating is based on other laptops at comparable prices, like the aforementioned Lenovo.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Touchscreen. Great Computer.", "Author": "Stewart R.

Hunt", "ReviewID": "RIRGY0VWHBIJS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So, I'm a techie and I own a small company that, for simplification, is a VAR and Systems Integrator. I'm also a Microsoft Partner, so I wasn't nearly as weirded out about Windows 8 as other users and reviewers. However, I had a Dell Inspiron that I spec'd out myself and purchased before working on a Presidential Campaign during the 2008 cycle that needed to be replaced. That older notebook was Windows 7 Professional and it had been a work horse for sooooo long, that I *hated* the idea of changing horses.My first impressions of this notebook are \"good\" and I feel that it was made well and the features, as promised, meet the expectations. The touchscreen is VERY responsive and works well. The display is bright and crisp... and the resolution is as expected. I AM NOT a big fan of the keyboard, but my muscle-memory for typing will change and I'll get more proficient. (I can say that a ton of vendors have gone to / reverted to this \"chicklet\" style of keyboard and it takes quite a while to get up to speed with them if you are used to a more traditional spacing and layout.)The system installed RAM is adequate at 4GB, but if you do development in Visual Studio or GameMaker or anything like that, plan on upgrading AT LEAST to 8GB. I've verified with other owners that this machine does take up to 16GB RAM when using 2 8GB DDR3L modules. I have ordered the upgrades and will update this post when I do so.One thing to consider is that the hard drive is a 500GB 5400 RPM drive... I will need to upgrade this to 1TB and will also report back on any performance gain acquired by going to 7200 RPM.On another note, I can't stress how relieved I am that the touchpad is not quirky nor error-prone like the ones on similarly priced notebooks from Toshiba or HP. I've already worked on these brands for clients and I can tell you that in Windows 8, having a crappy touchpad really, really screws you. This machine exhibits NONE of that behavior and the touchpad is luckily reliable and responsive!So far, this machine has taken everything I've thrown at it and with a few typical tweaks, I'll be a totally happy camper.", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's OK", "Author": "wrb", "ReviewID": "R1BY5MSFHD9QY4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I don't have any real complaints  I don't like windows 8, but that's not the computer's faultI think it was probably obsolete when I bought it, but it had a dvd drive which I wanted and a touch screen.I think the touch pad leaves something to be desired, but it mostly works OK.
