{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent laptop", "Author": "Neel", "ReviewID": "R3877WSREYGB6O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "On black Friday, I purchased a HP dv7 from staples. The specs are very similar (My laptop has less ram and memory, other than that they are exactly the same).I believe that this laptop is excellent. I have been using it for work daily for 6 months and am very happy with its maintenance of power and design. The 17..3 in. display is certainly not portable but excellent to view and thus capable of often watching movies on it. As far as aesthetics continue, the laptop features a brilliant chrome siding that truly captures the elegance of the laptop. I have taken the laptop on short journey's and found that its battery life is exactly as described. Even on high performance settings, the laptop can easily get 6 hours worth of battery life.Beats audio fitted the laptop with top-of-the-line speakers that can compete with even bose or sony independent units. The computer is fast and has shown no major defects overtime. I run many programs on the computer  and so far I have face no problems with anything. The graphics are excellent and the speed and battery life doesn't deteriorate quickly. It is a sturdy and good quality laptop.Overall, I would recommend this laptop for all ages and all fields(except portability, but even there, it is sturdy and has a good battery life).", "Date": "June 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good machine with usb3.0", "Author": "mike molchan", "ReviewID": "RY32UG14LDB8I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This machine has all the right stuff, widi, usb3.0 I7 2nd gen and a second bay for a solid state hard drive if you want to add it.

Norman", "ReviewID": "R11EEW0M5M4EU5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "While I will spend some time on the disadvantages of this computer, I must say there aren't many and I love it and am glad I bought it.This review, and also this computer, is really for power users.  Most of you don't need a computer like this... you can get away with a perfectly good computer much cheaper.Bought this at Fry's in Jan 2012.  It's a quad-core i7-2670QM running at 2.2GHz with 8GB of RAM.  Not sure of the exact speed of the RAM but Crucial's memory scanner pegs it at either PC3-10600 or PC3-12800.  I run some pretty memory intensive apps, and while this computer can be upgraded to 16GB, I haven't felt the need.  At the time of this review (10/13/2012) upgrading the memory would be $80 +- $20 depending on how well you shop.  It does have the Intel 3000 graphics built in with a minimum allocation of 64MB of RAM and a max of 1696MB (64MB Dedicated + Shared)My WEI with my SSD installed (not included with this purchase) is 6.3.  I don't quite know what it is without, I assume it was 5.9.Everything on this computer worked fine out of the box, however, I'm not a fan of bloatware and HP has plenty of it.  So I reinstalled Windows 7 with a copy of Win 7 I had on DVD and using the key from the bottom of the machine, it worked.  BTW, most of you know this, but most computers now do not come with restore CDs, but I think HP has one for $20.  I'm not too worried about getting one from them.  Go to their support website before you buy if this is something you need.One hardware modification I made was I got rid of the 5400 RPM WD 750GB drive and replaced it with a paltry 60GB 2.5 SSD from OCZ that I used in a previous computer.  This makes Windows 7 screaming fast, but doesn't allow for a lot of room to install things... and here's where my first complaint comes in.You have two drive bays for HD/SSD but good luck finding a second caddy/cable for it.  And when you find one, it's going to have to be a long cable (about the width of your keyboard) to reach the connector near the first HD/SSD.Intel Wireless Display is AWESOME.  I bought a Netgear Wi-Di box and hooked it up to my TV.  I can even play a show from Hulu or Netflix and get no audio or video lag.I don't play games on it, so I can't tell you how it would do with World of Warcraft or anything like that.  I presume it's neither great or bad, but that's a guess.It's shiny and easy to get dirty.  I found the fingerprint scanner to be useless, but that's because I did a fresh install of Windows.  HP's support site is good for finding drivers though, but not that particular one.Battery life... I get 6-8 hours EASY on this thing and I'll bet I can get 10 if I ever let it \"die\" as opposed to plugging it in at 10%.  Makes going to Starbuck's much easier. :)Wi-Fi seems to be good/strong/powerful.  Haven't really tried the Bluetooth, so I can't comment on that.  I also don't have any USB 3.0 specific devices yet, but the ports are plentiful... they aren't well spaces...so if you have a \"fatter\" USB drive (like my older SanDisk) that you need to plug in, you might have a conflict.Sound is surprisingly good.  Display at 1600 x 900 is crisp and clear.  Getting the back cover off is a pain, until you realize the only tool you need is a flathead screwdriver or butter knife.  Be gentle, though.Blu-Ray player, but no Blu-Ray software.  Be prepared to shell out for that.  I haven't really tried it yet.What else to say... I love it.", "Date": "October 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cheap Construction - Nice Features", "Author": "PC Green", "ReviewID": "R1M8GJCM7TSAKP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Bought this on sale as an upgrade to my old DV7 running Vista. My ultimate goals: 1) Desktop replacement and 2) Set up network storage backup drive using Windows 7 (more on this later). As with the earlier model, I always use an external, wireless keyboard and mouse -- I never touch the laptop, unless loading media (USB pen drive or CD/DVD).PROS: Screen (LCD vs. LED), sound (beats audio on the new model), and battery life (about 6-8 hours longer on the new model) were wayyyyyy better than the previous model. Awesome! i7 processor speed and Intel video are okay, but (anecdotally) my son's i3 processor seems faster when web surfing.CONS: Since I almost never use the keyboard (this laptop just sits on my desk no travel or rough use of ANY kind) I was stunned when I noticed the \"I\" key had come off. If I actually had to use the KB on this machine, it would have to be replaced. Pathetic!!! Second, I had wanted to set up a network storage drive so everyone in the house could back up and store w/o using individual storage units (for file sharing and security). After upgrading to a new, top-of-the-line router from Cisco with a USB port and spending several hours scratching my head as to why I couldn't read/write from the storage drive that I could see on the network, I learned that Windows 7 Home version does NOT support network storage! You have to upgrade to Windows \"something more expensive.\" What a rip-off! (Yes, I can totally hear all the Linux and MAC users laughing at me).Summing up: My wife's cheap-o $299 Acer is more solidly built than this laptop -- an embarrassing disappointment, since she constantly reminds me how much I spent on the HP!) However, the battery life and screen quality are very compelling from a buying standpoint; major improvements over anything I have ever used/seen in almost 40 years of computing!ADVICE: Look for a more solidly built alternative. We recently bought a Samsung Series 3 (comparable features, lower price), which has proven to be a better unit than the DV7. If you can afford it, go for a solid state drive, too. The drive speed on my DV7 seems to be creating a serious speed limit issue on the DV7.", "Date": "August 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Go with it.", "Author": "Dallas-Boy", "ReviewID": "R2N39UMYBH1PH3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very Good one.

Its case, keyboard, touchpad, features, speed, space & battery life are better than most similar models.  And it's almost as good as similar new i7 3rd generation models.  It cost at least $320 less than similar new models.  And I paid over $279 less than the same model anywhere else I found on the Internet, from anyplace I trusted!  It was also in its original box with everything that came with it.  But it was also packed with bubble wrap in another box, to protect it better.  And it looked like it was never used!The seller, JaysRentals was better than I expected.  Since James replied to my e-mail, after I bought it on the 4th of July!  And even though I chose expedited shipping when I bought it, he told me his shipping cost was 2.7 times what its shipping showed.  So I offered to e-mail him a pre-paid UPS or Fed-Ex shipping label.  Or I told him I'd pay his  extra shipping cost.  But he told me he would ship it for its under estimated expedited shipping charge!  So he shipped it USPS Priority Mail, with the amount of insurance I told him I wanted.  And I got it 3-days after I ordered it!So I highly recommend JaysRentals!  And I would buy anything I needed from him, if it was close to the lowest price I could get it for.

Buy at your own risk!", "Author": "Brazilian Jazzaholic!", "ReviewID": "R32GI5LUI2Q66R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After less than 3 weeks of normal home use, this laptop inexplicably crashed.  The computer was sitting idle when all-of-a-sudden, I got the dreaded \"Blue Screen\" telling me that there had been some sort of fatal/serious error, and that I should reboot my machine.  When I did so, the laptop wouldn't boot up, and instead I got a black screen telling me that there was some type of boot error because no operating system was detected.  (Strange, because this computer was running Windows 7 when I got it!)  The only thing worse than this malfunctioning lemon of a computer was HP's sub-par Customer Service (Tech Support).  First off, the representative seemed completely unsurprised when I described the problems with the laptop ... a huge red-flag indicating that this is most likely a common problem with this model of laptop.  Secondly, instead of really trying to help me solve the problems with the computer, the representative spent most of the call trying to convince me to buy an Extended Warranty from HP.  He even went as far as to say that HP doesn't honor any 3rd party warranties, including ones like the Square Trade warranty offered by Amazon.  Very shady sales tactics from an HP rep who was supposed to be helping me fix my computer.  At this point, I want nothing more to do with this laptop or HP Tech Support, so I'll be returning it to Amazon ASAP, and I will not be purchasing another computer from HP ever again.Grade: F",
