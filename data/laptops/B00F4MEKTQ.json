Anyone familiar with Windows 8 understands the importance of a touchscreen. For the price, this computer is a great deal. Don't be swayed by the lack of reviews, similar models with slightly different model numbers are very highly rated. I like the chicklet keyboard. My only slight very minor complaint is no hardware volume control. I have recommended this laptop to 5 people so far and they are also very happy with it. Let me tell you this too -- Amazon amazed me with the turn-around time. Ordered it Wednesday at 3PM and I had it Thursday at 4 PM! Amazon Prime and UPS have their act together, that's for sure!! Overall, this is a great deal on a great laptop.", "Date": "November 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this computer!!", "Author": "tlb", "ReviewID": "R9KK7T927LT9V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this computer during Black Friday week on Amazon for a really great price.  I have owned Dell computers in the past and the majority of computers at work are also Dell so this was a no brainer purchase for me.  The computer feels solid and the processor is fast.  Wireless set up was easy, registering the computer was easy and updating to Windows 8.1 was easy.  I have transferred hundreds of pictures and financial spreadsheets from my old computer and there were no compatibility issues.  The touchscreen works great and the display is better than I expected.  I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this again and would definitely recommend to others.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good computer for its price", "Author": "zhonghua zhang", "ReviewID": "RCLS9BXT8R9K5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this computer for my 12 year old daughter. It ended up me using it most of time. We all love it. We have 2 other laptops (Toshiba and Acer) at home which were purchased with similar prices. This new Dell laptop is the best in term of speed and easy of use. Touch screen is definitely a plus!", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for th\u00e9 price", "Author": "Ricardo Ramirez", "ReviewID": "R1EMWG9BRT3WN5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very Happy with th\u00e9 performance with it being so cheap.

I miss XP so much. It was simple; Windows 8.1 (which I downloaded first thing based on other reviewers' suggestions) is complicated and I just plain hate it. The computer itself is a dream. Low price, long battery life, lightweight, sturdy, and it's a Dell, which speaks for itself. This computer is very fast for loading files and lightweight gaming - I don't know about more complicated games. Colors are brilliant. Photos are sharp and clear. I love having the card reader right on the front and it reads the card from my camera perfectly. As I don't have cable or satellite at the moment, watching tv programs and movies online with this computer is extremely satisfying (thank you, networks, for letting us watch episodes online). They stream fast (on my old computer the sound and picture lagged and were never in sync). I especially love having the HDMI connector on this computer, as I can now hook it to my HD tv and watch all programs on the big screen. If you haven't bought your HDMI cable yet, I advise you to buy a long one. Mine is short and I have to leave the computer on the coffee table. I would prefer having it on the sofa with me. Watching them on the computer is equally satisfying, just smaller. The touchscreen......well, I can't say I really love it but as most people do, I guess I'm in the minority on that subject. I hate that the menu bar pops up all the time on the right side when I'm just trying to move the cursor. I hate that the screen image magnifies when all I'm trying to do is swipe upward to scroll further along in the text. I am learning more every day and will get used to the touchscreen, but I find I'm using the touchpad to move the cursor for the most part. It is reliable and unwanted items aren't popping up onscreen all the time. I highly recommend this computer for its price, size, and performance.", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "good computer for 11 year old", "Author": "Tara \"I like quality\"", "ReviewID": "R29YNPXJM5FJEK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Windows 8 + touchscreen is pretty cool. We went to stores and looked at much much higher priced laptops which had more gadgets (turned into a tablet, folded in half, etc.) but seemed crazy for a school aged child.

After hours on the phone w/ Tech Support, it was determined hardware was the problem. Had to wait for a tech to come to my house, and he changed the entire screen.

This laptop has met my expectations and for the product name, Dell is still up there in my book. Ordering through Amazon.com was my best choice as I received it in two days and the non descriptive packaging was such that UPS was able to leave it on my porch without anyone having to be home to sign for it. I had originally tried to order this through the military's exchange site but Dell's connection through the exchange fell through and it was going to be nearly a month before I could get the laptop. Thanks as usual Amazon for fast efficient service. The touchscreen is a new media for me so I find I'm having fun working between a normal touchpad, a mouse and then the touchscreen. Learning curves can be a bit bewildering (Windows 8.1 helps) but all total, I made the right choice and have already recommended this laptop to two of my friends.", "Date": "March 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best computer I've ever had!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R30NJLRUHTZUKD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's fast, it's light, it's secure.
