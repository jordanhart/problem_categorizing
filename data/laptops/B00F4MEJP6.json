It was not packaged well-  but thank GOD it did not get damaged.2. The operating system - Windows 8 - is just horrible.The laptop itself is attractive and sturdy. The computer is fairly quick and the colors/graphics are vivid. It's not for gaming - but it wasn't needed for that.The problem is with the operating system of Windows 8 - which works like a \"smart phone.\" It's all about \"apps\" - and is annoying beyond belief, not what my husband wanted in a laptop computer. (I purchased this as a Christmas gift for him.)Suffice it to say he's learning to use it, but does not love it.I DO recommend the computer itself because the price is reasonable and it's great for internet searching, social media and email.

I did some looking around... I wanted a laptop with a larger screen (bigger is better) and I'd always had good experiences with Dell laptops.  so, I've had the PC for a couple of months now and don't have anything negative to say about it.  It was delivered in flawless condition and has met every expectation.  I'm not a gamer, so I can't rate performance in that category, but I can give you the Windows experience numbers... oh yeah, I forgot that Microsoft removed that from Windows 8.  I do prefer Windows 7 to 8, but hey, Microsoft wields a might sword and we all must succumb, right?", "Date": "February 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Dell i17RV-8273BLK", "Author": "Gregory Clement", "ReviewID": "R2IMM51BUACK1R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Dell inspiron 17 i17RV-8273BLK 17.3- laptop is just what I needed for my studies, wide screen area, excellent surface are just a few reason for my choice and delivery was very prompt.", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Dell Inspiron 17 i17RV-8273BLK 17.3-Inch Laptop (Black)", "Author": "tech guy \"tech guy\"", "ReviewID": "RABIXY1EVTS83", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased this just before Christmas for a present to a 80+ year old relative.  The laptop was very reasonable at about $400 and it worked right out of the box without issues.  I took 1 star off because the PC has the Win8.1 Home version installed and I simply hate Win 8.  (As a professional IT admin, I work with XP and Win7 all day long.  I can configure a Win7 PC almost in my sleep these days.  But for some reason I never have been able to get my arms around Win8.  Anyway, back to my review of the Laptop...)The Laptop has a SD card reader that worked for my 64GB SD card and the Optical reader both read and wrote without issues.  I removed all the crapware that came with the laptop including the CD burning software.  I installed several (freeware) utilities that I like to have and everything ran fine.The only other thing that I hate is the touchpad.  Every touchpad that I encounter comes with \"taps\" enabled.  And everytime I rest my wrist on the touchpad, the cursor jumps and I loose my place.  The Dell setup utilities make it easy to disable the \"taps\" feature, but I hate that I have to do it manually.  It should be the default.The display is easy to read and is bright and very crisp.  All in all, I really like this low cost laptop.
