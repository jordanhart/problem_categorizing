I have always liked Sony's product line and fell in love with this laptop when I found it on Amazon. I have not been dissapointed at all, it is sleek, responsive and has far more power than I will probably use. The screen is incredible and the blu ray player is great. I would reccomned this laptop to anyone who is looking for a sexy multimedia powerhouse.", "Date": "October 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Working Great! Good Machine", "Author": "L. Rosetta", "ReviewID": "R1878TXFFUGAL8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my black FW465J/B about a month and a half ago. I couldn't be more pleased or satisfied with the product. I have own three other laptops before this one (Gateway, Sony, Toshiba), each lasting and in operation for more than 5 years. I still continue to use my Toshiba on a daily basis for work and personal.So far my Sony Vaio 465 is great. My current Toshiba has a 17\" screen. I needed the screen space but was very tired of lugging such a large and heavy computer around. The FW-465 is perfect in size an weight, w/ a large enough screen for running and viewing multiple applications.Before purchasing, i spent a lot of time researching and comparing prices among other computers. In my opinion, Sony offered the best bang for the buck. The computer is loaded with a great graphics card, excellent processor, lots of ram, enough HD space (7200 rpm), almost HD screen, good cd/dvd burner, great styling, great/fast wifi, sufficient battery life... all in a compact and durable casing.Some people may be dissatisfied with the screen display, but i have no problems with it. Nor have i had any problems updating or with system errors. Computer is quite stable and i am gain more confidence in it everyday. I say this because i was worried about the vista 64 bit OS, sony compatibility issues, error screens, etc. No problems what so ever, as of yet,... knock on wood.I have already begun loading this computer with a few productivity applications, all are running fast and stable.Computer is quiet and does not generate a lot of heat, unlike my Toshiba. Sony and its hardware do a great job of maximizing battery life. Computer boots up quickly and awakes quickly.The mouse track pad and mouse buttons takes a bit of getting use to, perhaps only because i've become so familiar with my Toshiba (of six yrs).I have no complaints about the fw-465.", "Date": "October 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Solid Laptop", "Author": "N.

Nice huge screen.  DVD playback is smooth and crisp.  Game play works exceedingly well, fast, and smooth.I like the keyboard design, where the keys are seperated from each other, sort of a mac look.  I do not like macs, because they are over priced and is not Windows.  The keyboard feature is nice, keeps dirt, dust, crumbs, etc out of they keys.Performance of the CPU, bus, memory, etc works very fast.  A great overall laptop for gaming, business, and entertainment.It feels sturdy overall and solid.  I have windows 7 Ultimate on here and no problem.  I didn't reinstall all the other junk it came with.One thing to note is when I open up the screen each time the point/hinge where the screen meets the laptop presses down on to the table or my lap and I feel like I will damage the screen while opening it.", "Date": "September 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "See VGN-FW373J Reviews", "Author": "C.

I didn't open the box for about one month, because I have 2 other Laptops an Apple and a HP.Then I used this Sony for about 2 months as a desktop, but not that much, so I didn't move or bring this Sony on th go.
