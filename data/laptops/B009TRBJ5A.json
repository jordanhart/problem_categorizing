One for my friend who needed a new computer and one for myself for when my current Lenovo dies.  I have the G560 laptop and LOVE it.  I like that this computer has 4 ports, mine only has 2.  I like that it has windows 7.  I really think the price is outstanding.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the speakers are not the greatest for watching movies but I just use headphones.", "Date": "September 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best feature is Windows 7", "Author": "Citywlkr \"Only put off until tomorrow what yo...", "ReviewID": "R1EBQO8UZUU8E9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Great secure packing from Lenovo. Didn't come prepacked with a bunch of junk. But also not loaded with normal things like adobe and flash.Computer housing, keyboard and touchpad is flimsier than I expected. Is slower than I thought. There seems to be different versions of G570. Which is very confusing.G570 has a 320G hard drive and 2.2 GHz Pentium B960, and G570 4334eau has 500G hard drive and icore3. I was shopping on a friend's computer under the duress of a HP (piece of s... laptop's CPU failure) and did not notice the extra letters in the different G570 models. I thought I was getting a great deal for $379. Since I've only had it for a month maybe I got an ok older no longer carried by lenovo model. I would have preferred something faster and sturdier.Two HP laptops I've had failed in just 3 years each. Nvida card melt down in first and CPU failure in the cheap class action suit replacement. Since I was determined not to buy HP ever again or torture myself with Windows 8 my total laptop selection was limited.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "A  Chinese piece of crap...", "Author": "loganburke \"kipper\"", "ReviewID": "R3CELSWAVWBKKG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Even with IBM babysitting these foreign manufacturers they can't get it right.  I looked high-and-low for a new computer WITHOUT Windows 8 before I settled on this model with Windows 7!!!.  And I do mean 'settled'.  I didn't want the 10key pad on the right of the keyboard, and I certainly didn't need all the additional, addon proprietary software, and I THOUGHT I didn't need the extra hardware warranty, but guess what.....the hard-drive went out on me and will cost $180.00 to replace.I paid $379.00 for this piece of s#$@ and that should have been my first warning.  Personal health problems have prevented me from attending to this until now, and of course I can no longer return it via AMAZON.Lesson...you get what you pay for!", "Date": "February 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "For the money, great deal!", "Author": "jdh", "ReviewID": "R1LJPG972IBT93", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Satisfied, great deal for what I paid for my laptop!

Then the screen picked up a green line through the middle and then the bottom third turned purple. All this after I spent two weeks moving all my stuff from my old computer - a process I hate anyway. Now I get to look forward to lovely process of repair or replace. Will write more when I find out how bad a nightmare that will be.The good news - as usual, Amazon is great at replacement or in this case refund. Even though it was on the last day of return window every thing went smoothly and service people very helpful.Replaced with a Toshiba - so far so good.", "Date": "October 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great cheap laptop", "Author": "MATTHEW A KENDALL", "ReviewID": "R51NG6HSZS0E7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using this for months and it has been fast and reliable.
