It is so user friendly.  The 17.3\" screen, Windows 7, and the 6 GB are a great combination.  It is still thin and light even with the DVD writer.  I have no problem while gaming.  I would recommend the Aspire E1-771-6458 to anyone.", "Date": "March 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works great", "Author": "Amber", "ReviewID": "R3419U1B5FE5GE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works great for what I needed it for, obviously won't play many games, but it's a nice little thing to go on the internet, or do work related things.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "I LOVE this laptop!", "Author": "Sanya Rae", "ReviewID": "R3R6PN4NC5LH3Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So happy I replaced my very lame HP for this Acer Aspire, it has met all of my expectations and more.
