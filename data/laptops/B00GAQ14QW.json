It has many features and I hope will last almost forever.

I gave it four stars instead of five as I really dislike Windows 8.  It does have Windows 8.1 though - so it has a Windows7 icon you can go on from the main screen.  I'm still learning how to use it.  I miss the back arrow to get out of a screen.  It's frustrating.  The company I bought from is a good company.  Delivery was fast and the company was very professional.  I like the blu-ray cd/dvd drawer.  The computer runs fast and the keyboard is nice.  All in all it's a good computer.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent!!!", "Author": "Rayner Durango Espinoza", "ReviewID": "R3K635PJ8BF1EG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It met my expectations.
