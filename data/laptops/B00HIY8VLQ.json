My primary purpose for purchasing this laptop was to have a mobile gaming console that I could work on away from my desk.This computer fits that need perfectly.Pros: Powerful, fast, easy to upgrade.Cons: Design is faulty in a few areas.I purchased the model that has two graphics cards, on is in the ultrabay. Exhaustive research confirms that this additional graphics card makes this perform on par with highest performing mobile graphics cards. This plays all of my games on Utra including the Titanfall Beta.The i7 is wonderfully fast.The Hdd is 5400 rpm. I upgraded this to an SSD. The additional SSD hard drive that is advertised (on some model variants) is not a separate hard drive, it is a cache on the 7400 rpm HDD and if you replace the original hard drive it will not function. Having replaced the standard HDD with an SSD this computer is the fastest computer I have owned. It boots to the login screen in under a second in Windows 8.1.The top of the laptop is aluminum which is very sturdy but shows prints. The bottom half is plastic and there is an edge around the keyboard that is sharp on the bottom of my wrists as I type. The red back-lit keyboard is nice eye candy, but it is a little out of place in conference style professional environments.Bottom Line: Powerhouse computer. The dual graphics card performs remarkably well. With an SSD upgrade it is incredibly snappy. Minor design complaints don't stop this computer from being the best computer I have ever owned.", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Intel Core i7-4700MQ 2.4 GHz Processor8 GB DDR3 RAM Discrete GT 755M 2gb Nvidia SLI Graphic 1 TB 5400 rpm Hard Drive; 8 GB Solid", "Author": "Walter Shivel", "ReviewID": "R2GWVUP2O6UPPQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have read many reviews on this laptop and I am going to try and not cover the same things. I spent several weeks researching laptops to play games and I kept coming back to the Lenovo Y510P. As an IT professional I have used Lenovo laptops at work and I have been under impressed by them. So I was hesitant to purchase this one. I am now a new Lenovo fan. Here is my take on all of the complaints i have read about this laptop.Battery Life - This laptop will not have stellar battery life. It is not built to be a highly mobile laptop. It is designed to play games and be plugged into power. If you want a laptop for watching movies on and surfing the Internet for hours without power plugged in, then get a tablet or ultra-book.Power brick - Yes, the power brick is big. I am fine with that. It is rated at a 170w and this laptop needs it. If it came with a standard small power adapter it would not last. It would also not provide enough power for the two GPUs, shortening the laptop's life.Heat - This laptop does get warm. All laptops that I have ever used for gaming get warm. It is just the nature of the beast. To help  the laptop from overheating get a cooler pad or set it on a hard flat surface. The cooling air is drawn from the underside of the laptop and exhausted out both sides. Don't block the intake ports on the bottom and you will be fine.Windows 8 - Yes, the UI for Windows 8 is horrid, but I chose to keep it installed. The hardware for this laptop is optimized for Windows 8 and I like how fast it boots up. In order to over come some of the shortfalls, I installed Classic Shell (Free). I have the Start menu back and I can customize all kinds of things. Pokki came pre-installed, I read good reviews about it, just decided not to use it. So far everything is running great under this version of Windows.Hardware Drivers - The laptop came with the latest 8.1 drivers installed. I did download the latest NVIDIA drivers from NVIDIA's web site. They work great and I used the GeForce experience  to optimize the supported games. I have had no trouble getting old and new games to work on this laptop. Many were purchased through Steam. I have not had any wireless network issues. It connects with no problem to my local network.Extra software - I just googled Y510P software and decided what to keep and what to uninstall. All laptops come with it to keep the price down.Touchpad - I really haven't had an issue with it. It is similar in design to what is on MacBooks. I really don't use it. I just plug in a mouse.Hard drive - I kept the stock hard drive that has the 8 Gig SSD cache installed. The performance seems fine to me. Programs load in a good amount of time and Windows boots up quickly.Military CAC - I did some research and got my CAC working without any issues on Windows 8.1. I am using the SCR3310 puck style card reader. Windows 8 installed it when I plugged it in. I downloaded and installed the Fedora Smart Card Manager (Free). It installed my certificates when I put my CAC in. In IE11 I added all of the sites I visit to the Local Intranet Zone and everything works great. Even OWA works.I gave it five stars because this laptop does what it was designed to do, which is play games. I realize that no laptop is perfect and I have decided to overlook any short comings and just enjoy using it. I don't think you can find a better sub $1000 gaming laptop.", "Date": "February 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Solid Gaming Machine with a Few Flaws", "Author": "Tim Cherry", "ReviewID": "RQL48HE7K3GHO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the Y510p for about a month and generally I've been very satisfied with it, though it does have a few minor issues. Rather than give a detailed review of all components, I'll go through a few pros and cons that I've found:PROS:- i7-4700MQ : Built on Intel's new Haswell architecture, it's tough to find a better processor for your laptop unless you're willing to spend *a lot* more.- NVIDIA GeForce GT 755M : I bought the model with a single 2gb graphics card, but have the option of buying another to fit into the Ultrabay which now houses a DVD drive. I've found that I'm able to run any PC game, even the newest and most demanding, with my single graphics card model and still get decent frame rates. I may end up getting a second card if I really want to push the graphics to the limit.- 1920 x 1080 Resolution- Ultrabay : I think that this is a clever design choice to allow for customization. Like I mentioned previously, mine came with a DVD drive in this bay, but I could remove it and add a second 2gb graphics card, a fan, or I believe another HDD is also an option.- Backlit Keyboard : The red backlight has a nice look. I also like how the keys are weighted and spaced for easy cleaning.- JBL Speakers : I think that the speakers sound very good, certainly a fuller, better sound than speakers on cheaper laptops. They may not be the absolute finest that money can buy, but I've been satisfied with the sound.CONS:- Trackpad : Looks like this is the most common complaint and I've got to agree. I've customized the settings as much as possible to get it acceptable, but it's still imprecise and often irritating. I prefer the trackpad on an old Lenovo i3 I have and would gladly change it with this one.- 5400 RPM HDD : Fairly slow hard-drive that bottlenecks the processor. Sooner or later I'll swap it with an SSD to really take advantage of the i7.- Windows 8.1 : Pretty much all new PCs come with it, so what are you gonna do? It's more a complaint with Microsoft than Lenovo, but I don't like the OS. I've customized it as much as I can to basically turn it into Windows 7.- Glossy Finish : It's a fingerprint and dust magnet -- I'd have preferred a matte finish.- Bloatware : Like most new PCs, it's got its share. Take some time to clean out and get rid of all the software you don't want or need.Overall I find this a very good computer, very capable of high-end gaming and demanding applications, definitely a great value for the money. I generally like the build quality and think it has a nice look, but the few irritating flaws keep it from getting a five-star recommendation. Maybe four and a half ...", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Just what I wanted and expected", "Author": "JoeBobWilliams", "ReviewID": "R1F9KG5JAVWJVW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop for school and gaming.  Mostly gaming....PROS:I play CS:GO and Civ5 and the laptop runs those games very smooth.  I'm going to get some newer games in summer and see how they handle so I'll update how the laptop handles them when I do.I also like the body style and the sound.  This laptop has Dobly Surround and it is very nice, even for a laptop.Monitor looks good great.  I had a 1366x768 laptop before this so it might just be the upgrade but ya, it looks awesome.CONS:This computer gets pretty warm when playing games.  Not HOT, but warm.  Using a Targus chill mat helped but it is still warm.The area on the perimeter of the monitor screen scratches really easy.  When I was pulling off the sticker from the camera I nicked it with my nail and now it has a permanent scratch on it.Lots of bloatware and it took me about an hour to find them all, uninstall, delete, or stop from running during startup.The Always On USB port ISN\"T ALWAYS ON.  It just works like a regular USB port.  This thing is supposed to work when your AC is plugged in and your laptop is turned off.RECOMMENDED FOR ??:I would recommend this laptop for savvy users of PCs.  You are going to have to tweak this thing to get the best out of it.  If you need help, just google any problems you have and I'm pretty sure you'll figure out.

It didn't seem to like anti alias much. But runs really smooth. Air coming out of it seems kinda hot when playing games shoots out on both sides so I guess you can say it's your own personal hand warmers! lol. Still trying to get used to windows 8 tbh I might just install windows 7 on it. Keys light up red which is nice some of them seem a bit dim though. Speakers and screen are very nice quality.

The red back lit feature is perfect for making the keys visible and looks nice too!KAHNs!:-The mouse track pad is indeed jittery at times but does not make it impossible to use - not recommended for gaming. I use a wireless mouse or a 360 controller.-1TB HDD is only at 5400rpm so there is visible graphic rendering in hefty games but I don't find it to be a burden to the experience at all and it can always upgradable if it bothers you that much.-It is indeed a fingerprint magnet. If this is something that would bother you I recommend a microfiber cloth with the purchase of this laptopOther notes:-Windows 8.1 runs programs visually blurry but TO FIX THIS, right click the .exe file you will be running select 'properties'. Tab over to 'Compatibility'  then check the box that says \"Disable display scaling on high DPI settings\". click OK and you're set.-Battery life is relevant to the power this machine needs - A LOT - keep it plugged in! You may get 3+ hours of battery life if you put it on power saver mode and dim the screen.-When I'm playing a game such as The Witcher 2 on ultra this machine puts out a lot of heat. It will eventually heat my 15' x 12' room without proper ventilation. I recommend keeping 2 inches, at the very minimum, of air flow space between the bottom of the laptop and its resting surface. Keep a window open and turn on a fan :)-THERE IS NO DISK DRIVE!

Screen has no blur when viewed  from sides.Cons: Hate Windows8 interface. The touch-pad is annoying, plug-in mouse is needed. Huge powerbrick and drop in gaming performance when unplugged.

As mentioned in several comments below this thing runs hot, A thing I have encountered is on updates the SLI gets disabled so you need to be sure to go back into the graphics settings and enable the SLI again or you will lose the performance of 1 of your cards.Overall this thing performs better than expected and will be a great addition for my traveling gaming needs.Thank you Lenovo for such a great performing laptop without the expensive price tag as you see on the others in comparison.", "Date": "May 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Some Flaws But Still the Best Laptop for the Money", "Author": "nicholas", "ReviewID": "R3H282EZURWOJN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:Great for gaming. The several performance tests I did ran Battlefield 4 consistently around 35-50 FPS on Ultra settings without Anti-Aliasing, and around 60-80 FPS (some tests saw 90-100) with all settings on Low. I'm anxious to see what this thing is like with a SSD, which I will be installing in the near future. This laptop is also great for Visual Studio and video editing. Easily the most powerful laptop for the price and competes with $1700 Sagers (my other choice) as far as specs go.Cons:I've had two of these. The first I returned to get the gt755m SLI version and because the headphone jack was faulty. So I got this model after returning the first (for a full refund) and  there are only four gripes I have with this laptop. 1. I would have taken a 20GB SSD over the 1TB HDD/8GB SSD cache. The HDD drive is ok, but at 5400 rpm it just isn't that fast. 2. This is the second y510p I've had with a faulty headphone jack. The audio cuts in and out and is pretty annoying for a $930 laptop. 3. The trackpad. OMFG the trackpad. It is, hands down, the worst trackpad I've ever used on any laptop ever. Absolutely buy a mouse if you buy this laptop. Finally, 4. This laptop gets pretty hot while gaming, and I would suggest getting a cooling mat for it.All in all this laptop is worth every cent. Powerful, dual GPU's that can handle any game out right now at decent, playable frame rates. Powerful core i7 processor that if coupled with a SSD is sure to be pretty beastly, and a 1080p screen. If you're unwilling to spend $2000+ on a laptop, this model of the Lenovo y510p is the only choice, IMHO.", "Date": "May 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great all around laptop", "Author": "Holly Beck", "ReviewID": "R1BAGARICBHK8Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was given this laptop as a graduation present and I had asked for this one specifically for a number of reasons. I did a ton of research and after looking through lots of expensive laptops, I found this one. I needed a laptop for a small amount of gaming (mostly just Ghost Recon Online), but I also needed one that was capable of skype and microsoft office. I'll go through a list of pros and cons since I found that helpful when reading reviews on which laptop to get.Pros:-Great screen (even though it is a glossy screen, I haven't noticed any annoying or excessive glares, viewing angles are excellent)-Keyboard (easily usable and when you don't want the red backlit keys you can turn that function off)-Weight (weight was never really an issue for me since I think even ten pounds can be easily carried around, but this one is much  lighter than I expected and very portable)-Number pad (a nice addition to the keyboard, even though it does make it a little cramped, that's all a matter of getting used to it)-Speed (Boot up time is excellent and I've never had to wait longer than 2 seconds for a page to open)-Performance (The one online game I play on here plays fantastic at maxed settings, and so far I've had no trouble with the performance whatsoever)Cons:-Touchpad (As stated in other reviews, the touchpad is not the best feature. It is a little flimsy and you have to push down further than expected on the buttons to get a click, but I will be purchasing an external mouse which should fix that right up, also why I didn't ding the laptop a star is it's an easy fix)-Battery Life (Going from a full charge to unplugging it and using the laptop normally, I get about 3-4 hours out of it, which isn't bad. Knowing that this is a gaming laptop mixed with a mulitmedia laptop that can do practically anything you throw at it, 3-4 hours is pretty good)-Fingerprints (The top of the laptop can get a few fingerprints on it, but honestly that's only cosmetic, so suck it up and look at what really matters about a laptop)-Heat (where your right hand would rest when typing can get a little warm sometimes, never uncomfortable, but just be aware of that)Summary: If you're looking for a quick, solid laptop that will be able to accomplish almost any task you throw at it, this is the laptop you want. You won't be able to beat the price for this kind of performance. In my opinion, the pros greatly outweigh the cons and I would recommend this laptop to anybody looking for a good solid laptop for daily use and games.", "Date": "May 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome Graphics!", "Author": "Walter L.

Arrived in 2 days as expected, in good shipping condition.----------------------------The Good:SLI Gaming performance is excellent. Which is good, because it's the reason I bought the thing. Requires lots of tweaking - see below.Very nice built-in keyboard. Great feel and 2-stage backlighting.On-board speakers are pretty decent. Headphone quality is excellent.Hardware in general is pretty nice.----------------------------The Bad:Bloatware. Lots and lots of bloatware. PC Decrapifier to the rescue!SLI performance tweaking - to get the best performance you need to do a lot of tweaking and online research and this can take a lot of trial and error. A lot of games aren't even close to compatible to SLI setups, though you can always deactivate the second GPU and use it as a PHYSX controller (hello Borderlands 2).The touchpad is pretty bad. I knew this going in, and since I use a mouse 90% of the time it isn't really an issue for me, but new buyers should be aware.----------------------------The Ugly:Windows 8.1 - more on this in a bit.Intel N-7260 Wireless connectivity issues - also more on this in a bit. Oh boy.----------------------------I've never really had high opinions of Microsoft, but the execution of Windows 8.1 pretty much validates every single bad opinion I've ever had. Nothing works as expected. Want to output video and audio through HDMI and close the lid? Prepare to pull out all of your hair. Want to constantly update, rollback and uninstall drivers? You're in luck.And the connectivity issues? What a mess. Just for fun, Google \"Windows 8.1 Intel wireless issues\" and be prepared to second guess your purchase. My 7-year-old Wii has more stable wireless performance than my new y510p supercomputing laptop. Seriously.To be fair though, I don't blame Lenovo for this at all and I want to believe it is bad software that will eventually be fixed. The blame is squarely on Microsoft and Intel buffoonery.Even with all the Windows 8.1 and Intel wireless monkey business, I DO still believe this laptop is worth the money.For under $1000 you will never find a laptop that can touch the y510p in gaming performance.

At a cost of battery life the SLI 755M's really pack a punch. To test I ran Batman Arkham Origins on full DX11 settings and it ran very smoothly even in intense combat scenes. Which my desktop's 570GTX had some stutters with. For me I only intend to game while plugged in so I'm going to purchase a $90 ultra bay battery and keep the ultra bay graphics card in the laptop case until I need. This will add around 6 hours of battery life and a single 755m is still a great graphics card for a laptop.The touchpadEvery laptop is different. Personally coming from my ASUS U81a this touch pad is a dream. I have absolutely no complaints with it all. I find it very easy and intuitive. It all comes down to personal preference. And I love the backlight keys.The software...Oh boy. It would seem one of the ways Lenovo can offer these laptops with such high specs yet low cost comparatively is that they subsidize costs with advertisers.  It comes preloaded with quiet a bit of bloatware. Most of which is easy enough to uninstall some of it can be tricky. It's been 3 weeks and I'm still unable to get rid of one piece that's loads at startup. Easy to turn off but not delete.The audioAgain comparing to my ASUS U81a the JBL speakers in this are simply amazing. It's like the difference between wearing headphones and listening to a 5.1 home theater setup lol. It's loud. I compared it to my friends laptop which is loaded with beats audio and I will say his speakers are significantly louder in volume but it's clear that they are digitally enhancing the audio not with hardware. The highs and mids sound very scratchy and unclear. That's not the case with Lenovo Y510p.

I live in sunny Florida and bring the laptop outside with me. Claiming to have an anti-glare screen, I'm ambivalent. Of my seven laptops, the Lenovo is definitely the best of the bunch in reducing glare. Still with a glass screen, however, there is no way to completely block the sun's reflection without adding a glare screen or choosing something with a matte screen.I am partial to the Lenovo because the eye strain is much less than any laptop or desktop I have used to date. I am able to keep it set at max resolution without ending up with a headache.The back-lit keyboard is not only aesthetically pleasing, giving that 'ooh and ahh' feeling, but it effectively lights the keys for easy use in dark areas. The best thing about the keyboard is that it give off extra heat. The machine stays cool to the touch on all sides and the fan is barely audible. My only complaint is the keyboard tends to be overly sensitive.The weight is reasonable, halfway between a laptop and an ultrabook, and rests comfortably on the legs, and still gives off no heat. The speakers are better than most laptops, no crackling or distortion at higher volumes. Wifi range is fantastic, showing five bars at more than 50 feet from the router and behind a concrete wall. I'm impressed by the snug connection of the AC adapter into the unit, having recently had an issue with another machine's shotty connection.The Lenovo Y510p is an excellent machine for work, gaming, and just fiddling around.

However make everything work slightly well is a real pain in the ass.GOOD:A lot of RAM, probably more than you actually may need for a laptopGreat proc. I believe most or almost every y510p comes with an I7Screen, I'm not sure how to feel about the screen. the resolution is just way to high 1920x1080 in a 15\" screen makes a few things difficult to read, and believe me, increase text/icon size is not a good option.Great sound, JBL speakers that actually sound decent.BAD:HD, come on, really? a regular HD? it is the bottleneck of the laptop, it supposedly comes with SSD cache but I can't see any difference. If you actually get this laptop you should also buy a good SSD to take advantage of the hardware.Design, I like the aluminum, however after reading on some forums apparently it tends to overheat, and I can confirm. If you use it without a good cooling mat you will have problems.Drivers and support. Not sure what is going on in laptop. I've always been a fanboy of lenovo I personally love my T430 and I can say it is the best business laptop you can get. But damn, they don't give a damn for Ideapad users. They drivers are faulty as hell. There are all kind of problems and they just won't give you a direct answer.The worst.Touchpad. If you are planning on use the touchpad forget about it.  It is just plain awfull, I got the ELAN one, after a few weeks trying different solutions it just won't work well so I just give up and always use a mouse.Battery: Lenovo has its own power management utility that isn't fully compatible, so if you install it it will mess up with your hardware and you will end up with a high end gaming laptop that can't decently run any game.Keyboard, damn, really a red backlight? thanks that you can actually turn it off. The thing I can't believe is the keyboard distribution. Backspace and enter keys are just way to small, numeric keypad to close what means that you will end up trying to delete something and instead you will just activate/desactivate num lock. And lastly who was the designer that forgot about adding multimedia buttons? you have two function buttons that pretty much do alt tab. But not a single multimedia button. What means that if you want to skip a song you need to do it manually and God forgives you if you are not using a mouse. Also there is no mute button. So if you want to mute for any reason you have to go all the way down with the volume.And probably I'll have to add bloatware, and lenovo software that doesn't work nor do I understand why they include them.

It was delivered the next morning, thanks for the speedy shipping, Amazon! By Saturday night I was ready to return it as unuseable for its stated purpose, gaming.First the good: it arrived exactly as described with 8GB of memory, 1TB hybrid hard drive, dual Nvidia 755 GPUs and 1080 display. I was not sure exactly what I would get as there are so many versions of the Y510p with seemingly identical specs at multiple price points. Initial setup was uneventful, just apply all of the software updates since the disk was cloned, install Steam and some games and then run the Nvidia experience app to set up the SLI profiles. Initial load of Skyrim took about 3-4 minutes; subsequent restarts of the game (and there were many, see below) were under 30 seconds so I guess the hybrid hard drive is doing its job of putting the frequently accessed data into the SSD cache. Once we started actually playing the game with 1920x1080, ultra-high quality and a lot of high quality texture mods we saw beautiful smooth movement with no visible lag or stuttering. I did not capture frame rates but they were at a minimum in the high 30s or better. Totally playable. Great LCD display, viewable from a wide angle horizontally. Keyboard is very nice with two levels of backlighting. Sound excellent for a laptop. One third of the bottom of the laptop is mesh, so cooling was good with quite hot air blowing out the left from the CPU, warm air out the right from the Ultrabay GPU, and cool enough on the bottom to be comfortable on my lap.Now the bad: Believe all of the bad stories you read about the trackpad, it is tragic that Lenovo put something this bad into such a good package. I expected the trackpad, with no separate buttons, to be similar to my MacBook, which has a rigid pad and push to click. It is a horrible flimsy plastic thing which bends and flexes and has no feel when a button is depressed. That is just the mechanical quality. Pointing and clicking during setup was bearable, but in Skyrim the pointer was twitchy and unstable to the point where it was impossible to navigate the menus at all. A bunch of adjustments to the mouse settings finally tamed the trackpad to where it could be used in the game, but I had to turn off all of the multi-touch features and put up with painfully slow pointer movement when in Windows. That was when we discovered the fatal flaw; the touchpad is disabled whenever a key is depressed AND THERE IS NO WAY TO TURN IT OFF IN THE DRIVER. This makes it impossible to play any FPS as you cannot look and move at the same time. Much internet research found that Lenovo apparently uses two different touchpads in the Y510p, either one by Elan with bad hardware and a horrible driver, or a Synaptics touchpad with (presumably) bad hardware and a decent driver. I got the Elan so the option of fixing the touchpad by tweaking the driver was out of the question. Finally found the solution by ZeiZaoLS on techsupportalert . com:\"On the newest Elan touchpad drivers it doesn't actually stop the PalmTracking from doing stuff by putting it on minimum. In order to really disable it you have to go into the Elan registry files and enable TouchPadRejection_Display (by setting the value to 1), then turn it off within the Elan settings. You can get to the proper registry file by hitting the start menu, then typing \"regedit\". Once in regedit, go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER -> Software -> Elantech -> SmartPadDisplay, you will see TouchPadRejection. Right click on it, hit modify, and change the 0 to a 1. When you go back into the Elan settings you will see TP Rejection, which you can turn off. This allows you to use the touchpad and move around at the same time, making playing games (Minecraft in my case) possible.\"So now my daughter can use the gaming laptop for gaming. I will let her live with it for a week see if she can live with the other trackpad faults; if not, it will be going back.One more thing: She is left handed so she normally swaps the left and right buttons. This is working well on the desktop and in Fallout, but in Skyrim the buttons swap back to 'normal' for some reason. This did not happen on her Toshiba.Bottom line: I give this laptop 10 stars for video and general build minus 7 stars for the touchpad.", "Date": "February 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Powerful but clearly cheaply made", "Author": "ChappyZach \"Zach\"", "ReviewID": "R218MQTVTOIBXC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Quick review:The Good:Power house.Runs games smoothly.Good pricetag for specs.HDMI out3 usb insno dead pixels after almost a year of owning oneThe Bad:The battery life won't last more than an hour unless you use powersave settings.Has the worst track pad I've ever used.
