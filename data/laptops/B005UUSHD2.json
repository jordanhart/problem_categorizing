She wanted something with a bigger screen. Luckily I found this.  She's had it a few months now and so far, its working out perfectly and I have had no problems with it.  The graphics quality and sound are great as she mostly uses it to watch Netflix.  I have no complaints about this computer for what I needed it for.  I cant comment on multitasking or using applications because it is mostly used to surf the net and stream. In terms of the exterior, well, its not top quality but luckily, nothing has broken as yet.  Must be good enough if my 8 yr old hasnt ripped through it by now because she's very fiddly.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love this product!", "Author": "noyp", "ReviewID": "R21ZK4J378E5ES", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far so good.
