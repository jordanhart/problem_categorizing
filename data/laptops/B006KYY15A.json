{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice machine with some caveats", "Author": "Piel", "ReviewID": "R1P6I6GTO69LAH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just got this laptop after having a 2010 MacBook Pro.  I prefer using Windows because Windows Explorer is way better than the Finder and Microsoft Office 2010 on Windows is still better than Office 2011 (at least for me).  I love the size and weight of this laptop (will be great for road warriors like me), as well as the fact that the WiFi supports A/B/G/N which means you'll get true N speeds (300 mbps).So far, I am impressed by the speed of the machine, but I have already noticed three things that definitely need improvement:1 - The issues that others have raised around the trackpad are real...too real...and they are probably the biggest weakness of this machine2 - Power management.  It seems as if the power profiles have a mind of their own.  You can edit them, save your changes and still not be garanteed they will work.  Also, I was hoping for better battery life in extreme power savings mode.  My Mac can get 7+ hrs on a plane (meaning no WiFi and screen dimmed down significantly).  So far, this new machine is telling me it can't get close to that.3 - The WiFi range is not as good as I would have expected.  Other machines I have (Mac and PC) tell me they 5/5 bars in terms of reception in a certain spot in my home, while this machine only gives 4/5....and it shows beacuse throughput drops from 300 Mbps to ~140 MbpsOn the plus side, as I mentioned before, the weight is great for someone who travels a lot, build quality seems solid and the machine is certainly fast enough to handle email, Internet and MS Office duties.  Overall, if I could have, I would have given this a 3.5 star rating.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "awesome laptop works well", "Author": "jennie", "ReviewID": "R3TRGGAHD0MEJP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "really good bought to replace my white mac book from 2008 its an amazing transition i thought windows 7 wouldn't be as good as OS x but i have to say its definitely improved since xp and  is simple to use and a joy plus every program actually works with it.", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic laptop for use with Windows 8!!! now is faster and very smooth!", "Author": "Carlos Franco", "ReviewID": "R16LCOWK9HN13W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, when I purchased this laptop I was very happy, I'm a samsung mobile fan!! they have never failed me in their phones (galaxy s2, galaxy s3 and note 2 soon) so 6 months ago I decided to buy this laptop cuz looks amazing!! extremely thin! with a modern look!! is very cool! everyone says: omg what a awesome laptop! indeed... but there are some problems...- Touchpad is not too good, it makes me headaches sometimes! just works perfectly some times, and other times not... when you do \"right click\" (pressing using two fingers) sometimes recognizes it, sometimes not! so you make\"left click\" instead \"right click\"... what a problem! but you will get used...- when you turn on your laptop, sometimes your touchpad doesnt work for a while, I think it just loading that function I don't know, you just can move the cursor but you are unable for a while to use \"right click (pressing the touchpad)\" UPDATE: NOW I'M USING WINDOWS 8, AND THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN ANYMORE...IMPORTANT UPDATE:Well I have installed Windows 8 PRO... a lot of \"bugs\" have gone!!! everything is ok now!

I am a business traveller and it is perfect for my needs. Its design is remarkable(it looks better than the mac book air in my opinion) and the built quality is impressive. It only weights something like 2.5 pounds. The wifi connection is fast and reliable. Windows 7 boots in less than 20s. The matte display is gorgeous and the aspect 16:9 aspect ratio makes this device perfect for watching TV shows/movies. The battery life is good. The keyboard could be better.I have owned this laptop for about than 2 months and I love it so far.  The price tag is a little high but you won't regret it.", "Date": "June 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worried because of mixed reviews, Extremely pleased with Product", "Author": "TomU", "ReviewID": "R74SVF3PJP3B1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before I heard about this laptop series, I thought about purchasing a MacBook Air. I really wanted an ultra light notebook.Then I went to J&R; in New York and saw the demo laptop of the new Titan Silver Series 9 by Samsung, both the 13 and the 15 inch.I was very impressed by the build in Duralumin. Similar build to the MacBook Air. That is the kind of build i really wanted. And part of the reason why i didn't go for the Zenbook by Asus which, to me, looks less professional than the MBA and this Samsung. I use my laptop for work and for meetings.I also didn't want to make the switch to Mac, I wanted to stay in the Windows environment.This laptop proved to be the best choice for me. Also i can boast that it is lighter and thinner than the Macbook Air :)My previous laptop was a Samsung Laptop P Series. It must be 7 times thicker than this new laptop.Overall I am extremely satisfied with the NEW Series 9 13\" Titan Silver. It is very light, with great finition.Some Amazon reviews were worrying me, specifically the talks about the mouse. I actually like the mouse. I can use double finger up down gesture, it has a left and right click integrated at the bottom of the pad. Sometimes while using the mouse it accidentally clicks and drags objects which could be annoying, but i don't really mind that. I think i am already getting used to it and i use the mouse now with short finger strokes and it seems to be working.There were no problem with the laptop except an annoying pre-loaded Norton program which i uninstalled right away.I immediately installed TeamViewer on my office desktop and on this laptop and now i can work anywhere i want with this laptop on my office desktop, it's a dream come true. This thing is so light that i finally enjoy Skyping with my family, it has a great little camera. I can grab the laptop with one hand and go around to show my family were i live. Feels great.All in all I love this laptop so much and I keep telling my wife about how I feel. She thinks it's a great looking laptop as well.I bought a MacBook Air Speck Fitting Sleeve that was in the Amazon suggestions, hopefully it fits well.There is a weird port on this laptop which i think is a custom Mini Displayport, but i couldn't find any adapter for it. So I bought the $37 Samsung mini-HDMI to VGA converter for presentations. The laptop comes with a Ethernet Converter dongle. Yes the laptop is too thin to even have a regular Ethernet port.Samsung is going to dominate many markets. That's what I predict. I am also planning to purchase the Samsung Galaxy S3 as soon as it comes out in the US.MORE: Forgot to mention a few things. Battery life for me is around 5h. The booting is blazing fast, 7 to 9s if you turn off the computer. But for the first time in my life i use sleep mode. Basically i just close the laptop each time i am done with my current task. I reopen the laptop when i need it again. It boots up instantly. Screen is a delight, it's quite stretched horizontally, kind of like a 16:9 ratio, great for movies, not so great if you have long vertical files to work on. Battery charges fast. No DVD player obviously. Wi-Fi works great. The computer is not blazing fast. If you want a high performance, high-speed laptop this may not be the best fit. But for me it's as fast as i need it to be. If you want to use it for video editing, not recommended. Great for office application, MS Office, browsing, etc. Yesterday I watched a movie on Amazon on demand and the sound was surprisingly good and clear, and powerful. How can good sound come out of such a thin thing.Thank you Apple for showing other manufacturers the way to make products that we love!! heheUPDATE ON THE SLEEVE: The Sleeve i was talking about fits very well!", "Date": "June 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "This thing is a lemon", "Author": "John R", "ReviewID": "R1NDMYR9HAQ3Y4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought the series 9 about 4 months ago and have had nothing but problems since and have not been impressed with Samsung's customer service. The computer works well when it is actually fully operational, but sadly the computer has only worked for a about 2 weeks before breaking again.First issue was related to the power adapter. The male/female part of the power adapter came loose, and the computer eventually just went dead. We called Samsung and they wanted us to send the computer in for a diagnostic and repair. I am a grad student, and the computer is essentially my lifeline so I was apprehensive about sending it in. Samsung customer service told me it would take no longer then 2 weeks but it ended up almost taking 3 because the techs wanted to wait for parts to arrive instead of sending a new computer.When the computer finally arrived it worked well for about 2 weeks, and then the battery went dead. The computer would work when it was plugged into an outlet, but the moment it was unplugged it would die. This computer is supposed to have great battery life, so needless to say a dead battery is a big pain. This was especially frustrating since we HAD JUST GOT THE COMPUTER BACK FROM SAMSUNG SUPPORT! Maybe this computer is just a lemon, but shame on the tech guys for not sending us a brand new computer. Needless to say, I was pretty frustrated after this happened and decided to call Samsung to reach some kind of resolution. I could not afford to waste another 2-3 weeks waiting for the techs to fix this computer. I expressed this point as best I could to Samsung support. I wanted Samsung to just send a new computer in the mail, and once it arrived I would send in the broken computer, but apparently this is too much to ask from Samsung. I was even told that \"they don't have extra computers sitting around\", which is ludicrous considering that Samsung is a computer company. Regardless, Samsung customer support wouldn't budge, and now I am stuck with an overpriced, lemon ultrabook that can't hold a charge. I will not be buying from Samsung again.", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Poor Linux support. Mic and camera not good.", "Author": "BRUNO A DO LAGO", "ReviewID": "R1QL6EWINW65NK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The laptop in itself is amazing. Slick design, super fast, stable. However, Samsung doesn't pay much attention to Linux as an operating system and for a long time (until a person from the community fixed it), the battery life was horrible (about 2h). Finally, the audio quality of the mic is poor and people on video calls cannot hear what I say. The quality of the front camera is not very impressive.On the positive side the display is amazing, the SSD that came with this version is super fast (although I have read somewhere that Samsung went back to a slower model on more recent version of the laptop - please double-check this info just in case).I'd buy another one if Samsung started to pay more attention to Linux (ensuring all devices and features work smoothly on it) and fix the mic/camera quality.", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Windows alternative to Mac Air", "Author": "Isabel M.
