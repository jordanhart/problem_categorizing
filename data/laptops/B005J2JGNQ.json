Curiously, this is true even if the recording level is set quite low.  I've tested this on laptops made by HP, Dell, and Asus, and got respectable sound quality on all three, so I'm guessing that there is a defect in the Acer motherboard chip set.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great quality for the price!", "Author": "Sarah Pearson", "ReviewID": "R2NXW7PZ7DCY36", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this computer on amazon, was a little skeptical at first, because I am so use to buying my computers at Best Buys or Frys, but the quality and price couldn't be beat!

He wanted to surf, email, write, etc.  USB ports were plentiful, he needed no HDMI or aluminum casing or 4.5-6 hr battery life as all this would have jumped the price from $350!!! to $850, hello?  I dont know what reviewers expect for a $350 laptop, really...unless you go refurbished and maybe grab something which was used briefly, defective, repaired and labeled as inspected/repaired (and i hear decent things about refurbs) you arent going to get alot of expensive features..which is why youre going cheap in the 1st place right?  Also, some people are real noobs when it comes to problems on computers and go off and use reviews to rant.  Seriously, get a hobby and some therapy.  We all get a lemon now and again, the law of statistics.  Some companies have so so Customer svs. I wouldnt know about Acer's as ive never needed to call.  I was a lucky one or an avg one i guess.  Ive had Acer monitors for business office, Acer products and now the Acer laptop for my bro.  All have been satisfactory.  dont not buy something because one person has the bad luck to receive a lemon.  Would you stop buying a toyota or honda vehicle because one person had a wheel axle not function, called Customer svs on a busy, horrible day when stars werent aligned and then say...whooooa! I aint gonna buy no more Toyota cars, uuum yep.  No I would hope you wouldnt.  Acer is a good co. just like ASUS, they offer premium products for less $ and often out do the Dells HP's and most of the old timers in the business.  They have to...they are lesser known and are not on tv spending gajillions advertising.  Take it from a level headed, highly experienced tech geek who builds her own computers and services everybody elses.  Do more than read on peoples reviews who often know little and expect alot from things.  Decide what you want, your budget, the prod features and then Google reviews by computer pros on a product if they can be found.  Go to the mfg website and also read features and detailed specs like how fast the CPU is and how big the hard drive is, how much ram it has and is that in one slot or divided in to the two slots.  Then be fair and if someone gets bad luck, realize too that there might be one bad apple but it doesnt color the entire product line or model.  So far my brother loves his Acer laptop and I loved the price as big sis had to buy him one so he had something to work on and Skype back n' forth so we could stay in touch.  Go for it!

No one contacted me and yet they closed the case.Mark: I put in my address in Yellowstone, the address of the [place I work] in Yellowstone, but both times it said \"Invalid Address\". So, now I have had to use a friend's address in nearby Gardiner.Mark: I have worked with Dell and HP customer support for 12 years and never had this kind of experience in not being responded to.Jimmy Jose: I apologize for the inconvenience happened.Mark: This laptop has a serious issue that must be hardware related. For one, I took it back to the factory defaults and still had the exact same problem with it freezing up when the fan comes on.Jimmy Jose: I understand that you have created repair order and unable to open the case foe detailed explanation.Mark: \"foe\" what?Mark: Why can't I open a case with Acer, with a laptop that's still under warranty????Jimmy Jose: Mark, your case ID is waiting for approval.Jimmy Jose: After getting approval, you can edit the case notes.Mark: That's because I just opened a second case a few minutes ago. Tell me why the first case was closed with absolutely NO EXPLANATION???Jimmy Jose: You was not suppose to open a case at that time.Jimmy Jose: Sorry for the typo.Mark: What do you mean \"I was not suppose to open a case at that time\"???Mark: What else am I supposed to do if I open a case and Acer closes it before doing anything about it?Jimmy Jose: Unfortunately you have no option to open two cases at a time.Mark: So, are you saying that Acer can close a case with no explanation and I can't open a second case???I then, asked to speak to his manager and it took about a half hour to get it across to him that I had not sent the laptop in and had it returned, but was simply trying to open a ticket for the first time. I explained to him that I took the laptop back to its factory defaults and it still freezes up and hesitates whenever the fan turns on, although it is somewhat better when the battery is not in it. After an hour, all he could do for me is give me a phone number to call tomorrow...MY ADVICE TO YOU IS NOT TO PURCHASE AN ACER COMPUTER! I SUSPECT THAT THEY ARE STUFFING THE BALLOT WITH FIVE STAR REVIEWS FROM IMAGINARY CUSTOMERS AND HAVE DESIGN PROBLEMS IN MANY OF THEIR MODELS.
