{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A competent laptop with a few shortcomings.", "Author": "DB Edwards \"Tally Ho!\"", "ReviewID": "R2OOJ7MAN395KY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Previous to this Toshiba C655-S5132 laptop I owned an Acer Aspire One 8.9 inch netbook. The most impressive feature of the Toshiba is the 15.6 inch screen, which is a delight to view. It's so easy to read and is sharp and bright that photos pop out of the page. This is a user friendly computer and handsome at that. It is very quiet and doesn't heat up on you. The surfaces are textured so fingerprints aren't an issue. The keyboard is full size, unlike my Acer, so it's really easy and comfortable to type on. The wireless is very powerful and can pull in signals without an adapter. You can piggyback signals without the need of a booster antenna. Internet access is relatively fast and reliable. The six cell battery is long lasting, almost four hours. The audio speakers sound a heck better than what I've been accustomed, although a pair of add-ons are necessary to give you quality music reproduction. The Windows Seven software is very basic and simpler than the Microsoft XP program. It is streamlined and more intuitive, but once you get the hang of it you can accomplish whatever it is you need to do.  The 3GB memory drive is very ample with plenty of space to spare for your files, photos and music downloads.  There are a couple of items that could be improved, however.  The Toshiba features only two USB ports situated on the left side. Three would have been better (with one on the right), 'cause I don't like the fact I have to stretch the mouse wire to my right side (I'm right handed, wouldn't matter if you're a lefty). The mouse by the way is an accessory- it isn't included in the purchase price. Secondly, a webcam would have been a nice addition. But overall, I am enjoying this laptop. It has no technical issues and the unit appears to be dependable. For the money I feel it's a good buy and superior to the Acer netbook.", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very happy with the Toshiba Satellite C655-S132", "Author": "lizzp91105", "ReviewID": "R3HH0UFDYHZUVG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I replaced a four year old Compact which just went belly-up one morning upon startup. Fortunately I had done a complete back-up, on an external drive, the night before. (Hard to believe I got that lucky and I definitely recommend doing so frequently on an external drive it saved me many headaches.)I really like the keyboard which is standard size for a laptop and has a separate numeric pad which I use frequently. The screen is very bright, but not glaring and so far I have no complaints. Yes, I too would prefer to have another usb port on the right side, but since I use a wireless mouse I have no problem with the cord being stretched. If I need more usb ports, I can always purchase a Black 4-Port High Speed USB 2.0 Hub from Amazon they are on sale today for $2.95 regularly $19.99. Black 4-Port High Speed USB 2.0 Hub I'm very happy with mine and will be telling my sister to get the same one, so you know I must really like it!", "Date": "May 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Choose something else.", "Author": "Mikal", "ReviewID": "RYNKTA8RG5VHK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've had this laptop for about 3 months. Out of those 3 months, Ive only used it a handful of times to check email. The screen just blacked out and it's a known issue. So you can choose to buy this one because of the price and the cool commercials, like I did, or spend a tad more and have a reliable laptop. I would take mine back but I threw it across a parking lot. Toshiba has good products but they dropped the ball on this one.

My first one's hard drive crashed after being dropped only about a foot onto soft carpeting.  Since it was 2 years old at the time, I did not make a fuss about it.Since I was used to the Toshiba layout and thought that they were decent products, I decided to give them another chance.  What a mistake.  I purchased this model from Best Buy just 8 months ago and the screen is no longer functional.  Best Buy accused me of dropping it - which DID NOT happen.  So then I contacted Toshiba, hoping that they would make good on their 1 year warranty.  I was told that their warranty does not cover the screen.  What a joke of a laptop and of a company.  The Toshiba representative made the mistake of comparing their warranty to a car's manufacturer's warranty.  My profession is in the car business and I frankly told the representative that it was a horrible comparison because new car warranties would cover almost anything wrong with the car during the warranty period - UNLIKE Toshiba.  TWO THUMBS DOWN FOR TOSHIBA.

Even though I didn't buy it, I have never been more happy with a laptop! Looking at buying one for my husband. We previously owned two HP laptops and they didn't even make it a year before they started having problems. It has always done everything I've needed it to do.

It just made a noise and then would not open, let alone do anything else. The Toshiba Warranty people were terrible -- their only solution was for us to backup our laptop and mail it to them and then 5 weeks later, maybe we'd get it back fixed or maybe a whole different computer (a reconditioned one), at their discretion. What this really meant was that we'd have to wipe the computer clean to avoid any identity theft and then reinstall it all again later. They refused to send us a replacement drive (that we or a local company could install for us), or let us take it to a local place to fix. Consequently, since we couldn't be without a computer that long and really didn't have time to deal with wiping the computer and re-installing everyting, we were out $60 to have a local company fix it for us. Best Buy, where we bought it, was also NO help. So much for the Geek Squad -- more like a big Zero Help Squad. All they offered was to help us mail it to Toshiba. Also, FYI, if you're not looking at this in person or out of the box before you buy it, the case and the keys on this model look cheap and flimsy.", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Do not buy this", "Author": "Carol S.

I did nothing to the screen to make it crack.  I was told by Toshiba that it was not covered by the warranty.  The cost to replace the LCD screen is anywhere from $175- $400.  I paid $374.00 at Best Buy for this computer. I had a Dell Inspiron 2200 for six years. I have never had a problem with Dell fixing anything on the computer.  My screen never cracked.  I also had a Gateway desktop for many years with hardly any problems, and Gateway always fixed whatever was wrong.I bought a new computer because the backlight to my Dell was going out and I thought getting a new computer would be more cost effective because it would be brand new.
