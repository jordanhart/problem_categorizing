There is an inherent flaw in the design that cannot process static properly (forgive me as I don't know exactly what happens), so without warning the screen will turn fuzzy, like a TV channel with no reception.  I have been working with Dell for almost 2 months to correct this problem.  They \"fixed\" my initial computer twice and it still is doing it.  Then they sent me a replacement unit which also does it.  I am now awaiting a new unit model replacement.  There is a forum on Dell's website where there are HUNDREDS of units doing this.  Please, please, please do not buy this model!", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Intel Core i5 2520M(2.50GHz) Processor, Genuine windows 7 professional 64 bit operating system\n4GB DDR3 Memory\n320GB Hard Drive\n14.0\" LED display/Dell Wireless 1501 802.11b/g/n Half Mini Card with Blue tooth\nIntel HD3000 Graphic/8X DVD+/-RW", "Name": "Dell Latitude E5420 14\" LED Notebook - Core i5 i5-2520M 2.50 GHz", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31r62Cb1NML._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004Y3PYK0"}}
