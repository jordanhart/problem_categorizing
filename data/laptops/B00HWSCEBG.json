Solid state HD, blu-ray, dedicated graphics, back-lit keyboard, windows 7 with windows 8 disk if you wanted to \"upgrade\" even though I haven't come across a single person that has anything good to say about windows 8.Anyway, I've only had this for 2 weeks, but it is super fast, didn't have much bloatware to remove, and has handled any game I've played easily. I don't play anything like warcraft, but based on what I've played, I know it would be able to handle it just fine.The only con is the battery life. I'm still giving it 5 stars because I read about this in other reviews outside amazon. You can play with the power settings, but utilizing all performance features, don't expect much more than 2 hours... 3 hours tops if not running anything remotely demanding. This didn't really concern me since I wasn't looking for ultra-portability, just something around the house or whatever where using the power outlet isn't a big deal when needed.If you don't need extra long battery life, I would highly recommend this unit.", "Date": "May 31, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,444.98", "Features": "Windows 7 Professional 64-Bit; 2.4GHz/3.4GHz Quad Core Intel Core i7 4th Gen Haswell CPU\n15.6\" HD TruBrite\u00ae LED Backlit Display (1366x768); Blu-ray DiscTM RE Burner/Writer Optical Drive\n2GB GDDR3 NVIDIA \u00ae GeForce\u00ae GT 740M with OptimusTM Tech; 8GB DDR3L 1600MHz SDRAM\n128GB Performance Solid State (SSD) Hard Drive; Intel WiFi-N 7260; Bluetooth v4.0; WiDi; HD Webcam\nFull Size Backlit Keyboard, harmon/kardon Audio, HDMI, Intel 1Gbps LAN, 1 Year Toshiba Warranty", "Name": "Toshiba Satellite S50-ABT3N22 15.6\" Quad Edition Windows 7 PRO Laptop PC (S55 with Intel Core i7-4700MQ, Blu-Ray Burner, 2GB NVIDIA, Win 8.1 Professional Option, 128GB Performance SSD, 8GB RAM)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416srGaeEJL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00HWSCEBG"}}
