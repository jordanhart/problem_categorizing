I also like that the battery is decent enough to use for work.  This laptop will not say no to anything currently on the market that you might ask it to do.Pro's: Fast, powerful, lightweight, decent battery considering the hardware, SSD+Data, slid through Far Cry 3 without a stutter.Con's: No touchscreen.  I don't really mind Windows 8 with a touchscreen, but without one the features of  Windows 8 are pointless.  When I first got it I was nervous because the base of the laptop feels like rather cheap plastic.  I suppose this is what gives it the lightweight edge.  Fingerprint magnet.  The screen is just okay (but this thing looks beautiful via HDMI/HDTV.)Would buy again and recommend if you are looking for a solid yet mobile gaming machine.", "Date": "February 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Computer", "Author": "Jacqueline", "ReviewID": "RK2Q7DSNGII4A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I haven't had a single problem yet.  The computer starts up in 15 seconds with me typing in my login.  Starts up programs quickly and has never had problems running a program smoothly and I play a lot of video games as well as run a lot of graphic design programs.  The design is sleek and lightweight.  Seems very durable and is very easy to carry around.  I have yet to have a single complaint with it, though I have only had it for a bout a month.  We will see how it holds up in the long run.", "Date": "February 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not a single issue", "Author": "Bradley", "ReviewID": "R2ZRF5NIPZJ4B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Except for Windows 8 being horrible as an OS, my MSI has been brilliant.
