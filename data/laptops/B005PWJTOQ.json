{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Big and heavy, but perfect.", "Author": "Jonathan Walters", "ReviewID": "R3MRXY55KO8AHL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I originally started looking at the ASUS G74SX-TH71 and other gaming-grade laptops when my wife and I decided to convert my sacred 'man cave' (office) into a nursery, and so the room no longer existed in our house for a desktop PC, huge glass desk, and triple 28\" monitors. I definitely consider myself a gamer, and so I was skeptical about finding a worthy laptop replacement that didn't break my $1,500 maximum budget.Enter the ASUS G74SX-TH71. After much research, I decided on this machine mainly due to the cost vs performance ratio. Names like Alienware aren't important to me, and I was simply looking for the best system I could get for under $1,500.After having a few days to get acquainted with this PC, I have the following observations, both positive and negative, that I think might help others who are considering this system.*This laptop is big and heavy, relatively speaking. Weighing in at just shy of 16 pounds, this thing is a monster when compared to most other gaming laptops. And with 12.8\"x16.5\"x2.4\" dimensions, it will only fit in all but the largest laptop backpacks and messenger bags. I myself bought a Targus XL to carry it, which is a perfect (but very snug) fit.*The Core i7/Nvidia Geforce GTX 560M (with a whopping 3GB of video and 12GB system RAM) are a lethal combination that is sufficient for 95% of your gaming needs. I am currently and mainly playing BF3, League of Legends, Cities XL 2011 and Empire Total War on this machine, and all of them run smooth. The big test for me was running BF3, and I was completely surprised to see how smooth this laptop ran, especially in multiplayer where it really counts. Dollar for dollar, I can't stress enough how great a value this machine is as a gaming laptop!*Lots of great features you'd expect in a high-end laptop, like blueray drive, integrated webcam, and useful (if not at least neat) software out of the box. I particularly like the ASUS SmartLogon feature, which uses facial recognition software to log you into your PC with the built-in HD webcam. Overall, the machine came with a minimum of bloatware that I had to remove, but I was annoyed by a lack of physical system restore media, which the computer prompts you to create.*Excellent heat management. Even after playing BF3 for and hour straight, the laptop itself is cool and the exhaust system is completely adequate. Which also bring me to another point...*Since the back of the laptop is taken up by the massive exhaust system, all ports are located on the sides. This can be a positive or negative, depending on how you look at it. I personally would have preferred the power adapter connection on the back of the laptop and not on the side.*The screen is big, bright and beautiful, but the anti-glare coating might turn some off if it's not your thing.*12GB of RAM out of the box, and another slot for 4 more! It also has a second HDD bay, which makes it easy to install an SSD to use as your OS drive for even better performance! These components are also easy to access and service, as it only takes unscrewing a single screw, and the whole panel pops out which allows access to HDDs and RAM all at once!The bottom line?As long as the sheer size and weight don't bother you, this is hands down the best value for your money you're going to find in a mid to high end gaming laptop. Sure, you can spend thousands more on something else. But this thing plays brand new, high-end, games coming out like BF3 with no problem, and has specs (and expansion capability) that put many higher-priced machines to shame. If you're on a budget, don't mind the size and weight, and need a laptop that you can play the newest games on, then look no further! Just make sure you also invest in a good product like the Targus XL or Everki Beacon to protect this beast when you're hauling it outside the home...", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "G74SX-TH71:  Blows away the Best Buy model (BBK7)", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "R34B4ORA7YGACR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Was going out the door to Best Buy for the G74SX-BBK7 and decided to take another look online.  I was first disturbed it did not have a blu-ray drive, and then couldn't believe how I could get this and so much more with the G74SX-TH71 for just about $43 more after S/H vs tax.  So I just purchased the TH71 from Amazon (ships from TigerDirect).  Check it out.Price:  ~$43 more for the TH71 (1299.99 + 14.95 S/H = ~1315) vs BBK7 (1199.99 + 72 tax = ~1272).RAM:  12 GB in TH71 vs 8 GB in BBK7.Processor:  Newer/better i7-2670QM in TH71 vs i7-2630QM in BBK7.Video card:  both are Nvidia GeForce GTX 560M, but 3 GB in TH71 vs 2 GB in BBK7; I also read the video card in the BBK7 only has a bus width of 128 bits compared to 192 bits in the TH71 and other G74SX's.Display:  1080p HD resolution in TH71, not in BBK7Optical drive:  Blu-ray player in TH71, not in BBK7HDD:  The only sacrifice, get 500 GB in TH71 vs 1 TB BBK7.  Would much rather have all of the above features than a lot of empty hard disk space.  Plus there is an empty bay where a second HDD (or SSD) can be added to the TH71.Best $43 I ever spent.5 stars for value.  Will review performance once we've used it a bit.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Laptop is very impressive!", "Author": "Gary D Sell", "ReviewID": "R3238S84U02XEX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't care about compact or lightweight, I wanted a laptop I could use as a home computer, would be portable if needed, and would never lag.  The Asus G74SX laptop is definitely a beast, but man what a powerhouse.  I got what I needed and more, wow!  Built well, screen resolution up to 1920, and tons of muscle.My wife summed it up when she said I had the Death Star of laptops.The **only** issue I have had so far (I have had the laptop for a week) is the mousepad is UBER sensitive... when I type without touching the mousepad it still senses input and moves the cursor on the text while I type.  I did a little research and found this is a occurring (don't know how common) problem with Asus laptops.  It was not an issue for me as I always use a USB wireless mouse, so I simply disengaged the in-keyboard mouse in the control panel...  problem solved.If this is the only problem I have with this laptop I will be happy with it for years.", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "ASUS G74S", "Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "R2Q9J4ZZGQ967K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The ASUS G-Series has handled everything I've thrown at it, with ease.
