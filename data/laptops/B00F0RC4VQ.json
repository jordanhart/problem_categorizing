(I got mine for $999.99)Besides the obvious facts that this laptop has great specs, this is why I like and dislike:CONS:- The keyboard can turn a bit hot when gaming.  However, I use it with a external keyboard and mouse so it is not a big deal for me.- The touchpad is a bit oversensitive.- It is larger than previous Ideapad Series Y 15\" laptops.  (It barely fits in a laptop case I used for my Y580)- 5400 RPM hard drive and no mSata connector.  (Come on Lenovo, who wants a 5400 RPM hard drive for a gaming laptop?  At least include 7200 RPM and/or an mSata connector)- It is a bit complicated to remove the bottom cover if you want to upgrade memory or hard drive.- It has a heavy 170w power adapter.  So the regular ac adapters that you can get at your local PC shop will not work if you want to game)- The Intel HD graphics drivers do not come installed.- The screen is very nice.  However, the bezel is very glossy.PROS:- Ultrabay - Apparently Lenovo will start selling DVD, Blu-Ray, Fan cooler, and hard drive adapter for this port.- Best specs for the money.  (The dual Nvidia 750M in SLI perform similar to a single 770M)- The speakers sound great- The back light for the keyboard can be adjusted (Low/High) depending on how dark is the room where you are using it.- The Intel HD Graphics can be enabled in order to extend battery life.Tips:1) If you are using Windows 8.1 and the second 750M is not showing as SLI capable then you have to update the BIOS.[...]2) If you want to improve battery life by enabling  the Intel HD 4600 graphics  (Nvidia Optimus):  2.1 - Turn off the laptop  2.2 - Follow the instructions to remove the second graphics card (fairly easy)  2.3 - Turn on you laptop and install the Intel VGA drivers found in your Lenovo partition (Drive D for mine)  2.4 - Now you will see the Intel logo in your task bar.  (Optimus will not work if the second graphics card is inserted in the Ultrabay port)3) Upgrade to a SSD of at least 250GB (More GBs is better but costly)4) Use a cooling pad when gaming5) I have used 90 watt ac adapters when I'm not gaming or doing anything graphics intensive without signs of overheat.  I would suggest to remove the second graphics card if you want to run games  but you don't have the 170W brick handy.", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "For Gamers on a budget!", "Author": "Cornelius Stoute", "ReviewID": "R1YJ1EAXMQR4HS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely loved this product. It will run any current high graphics game on the market. The only thing is that it gets pretty hot only at the sides, while the keyboard remains relatively cool.

Some laptops include the SSD, some laptops don't include the SSD but have the slot on the motherboard to install your own, and for some reason there are quite a few out there that don't even have the slot soldered on to the motherboard to install the SSD.I purchased from this page because the product clearly states a 1000GB Hard Drive and 8GB SSD. I'll just fill you in right now, this particular model shipped by this product page does not even have the connector for an SSD soldered on to the motherboard.Great laptop regardless, slightly disappointed, I wish Amazon would do a better job of keeping product descriptions up to date and accurate.", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "my son's face", "Author": "James Myhre", "ReviewID": "R1V2AUGSK5G147", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We decided to buy this for Christmas for my 8th grader with the notion in mind that he would be able to take this to college in 4-5 years and it would hopefully not be obsolete.  It was much more than we wanted to spend, but convinced ourselves to do it anyway.  His reaction, however, when he opened the box was priceless.  It's hard to get a reaction out of teenagers who know everything some times, but not this one.  So far, he has been on it non-stop and the graphics are great.  Funny that he mentioned one of the things he liked most as the lighted keyboard.  Even a month after the purchase, he tells me  \"it's awesome\".  The primary reason we purchased this on Amazon was that we stood for 25 minutes in a Best Buy store when it wasn't all that busy and never got acknowledged.  When we walked out, we informed the manager that we were going to make the purchase with someone else and Amazon was great.  Oh, well, I know there's not much technical jargon here, but it was a great purchase.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worth the money, good hardware, nice design, overall best price for the performance it packs", "Author": "Thierry", "ReviewID": "RME4CSD0CET14", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The version I got of this laptop is the 1,200$ one with SLI, 1920x1080 resolution screen, 1TB HDD, 8GB.There is nothing I find that I don't like about this laptop besides the fact that Lenovo and Microsoft tend to pre-install useless apps that unnecessarily takes up too much space (summarizes what Windows 8.1 really is).DESIGN sleek design (compared to most regular laptops, let alone gaming laptops). I really like the nice brushed aluminum look that makes it appear simplistic while elegant. Nothing flashy like most other gaming laptops which tend to go overboard on the design. The tic tac keyboard feels nice and responsive when I type,HARDWARE. I find that the SLI configuration does its job at playing most games on Ultra or at least High settings with Vsync, Anti-Aliasing and Ambient Occlusion all the way. I've used FRAPs to capture the framerate and on power hungry games like Battlefield 4, it surprisingly does well, staying around at least 45 fps on High settings. The only drawbacks of having SLI though is that there is very noticeable microstuttering(flicking/flashing graphics during movement) that happens on some games and it is common problem among many SLI setups. Playing with a SLI set up is also more unstable than normal, where certain times, part of the graphics on screen would glitch and malfunction but when SLI is disabled, it goes back to normal. But that is the developers end to fix that. Besides that, I would recommend to get the SLI if you really want to play games on this, otherwise, you are stuck with playing on Medium graphics settings.The hard drive on this laptop is horrendously slow. Its only 5400 RPM compared to the normal 7200 RPM HDD. and even then I still considered that as slow. So if you want really anything to load up, read, transfer instantaneously, I recommend you buy a SSD and swap out the HD. I swapped mine for a 500GB Samsung 840 EVO and computing was never the same for me. Boot time for this computer is around 4 seconds compare to 20 seconds, loading Photoshop took 1.5 seconds compared to 10 seconds. Another part I swapped out was the RAM, for a new Corsair 16GB RAM to handle more multitasking. During the installation of these parts, removing the bottom cover of the laptop was really easy, simply remove the battery first, unscrew all the screws and gently pry the cover off and pop in whatever parts you want.Overall I was generaly pleased with the performance,  stability and design that this laptop offer. Most of the promises of this laptop came through and certain ones exceeded my expectation. Priced at around 1,200, I would say it is worth the money. If you choose to upgrade it with a SSD, the total cost of the laptop and SSD combined would be only a fraction of what the overpriced MacbookPro would be while surpassing it with twice the performance and capability. While being powerful to game with, compact to bring around from place to place, and versatile enough to handle all kinds of work put out for it, the Y510p is the best laptop I've ever bought and being a computer science student, I would really recommend it to anyone out looking to buy a monster of a laptop.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Absolutely love this laptop......Thus far", "Author": "Alisha Cates", "ReviewID": "R38RPN408PBW4D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a college student (Accounting and Bookkeeping) and do a lot of internet surfing and social networking, in addition to having a ton of photos that I store on my laptop. The Toshiba laptop that I had purchased in 2011 absolutely sucks, so I decided to purchase a new laptop. In the beginning of November, I had initially purchased an ASUS with a touchscreen, however it did not have the 10 key not did it have a backlit keyboard, so I gave it to my husband.After doing some more research I decided on this laptop because of the ratings, the name Lenovo, the materials the laptop is made from, the backlit keyboard, the 10 key and of course the RAM and processor on this. I received my laptop Monday December 23rd and I absolutely love it!I enjoy typing on this keyboard more than I do on the 3 other laptops I have in my home (2 Toshibas and an ASUS). The touch pad does not get in the way with my typing. This laptop does not get hot like the two Toshibas we have do, I mainly leave this plugged in on my desk and use it as a desk top \"per say\" so I am fine with the size.I don't have any issues with the Microsoft Windows 8......honestly I enjoy the format, functionability and look of it. I am still in the process of learning what all the software programs are that came installed on this, as it seems to be more of a \"gamers\" laptop.....however I will say I was very pleasantly surprised, when I found out that my laptop came pre installed with the Dragon Assistant software.The only issue I have with this laptop is the fact that I now have very visible fingerprints on it, the aluminum material this is constructed from picks up fingerprints very easily and being slightly OCD I'm constantly wiping it down. If it wasn't for the fingerprint issue I would have given this 5 stars.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "good for gaming", "Author": "Jiyuan Shi", "ReviewID": "R1CG9B9OX5P50Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this computer is fantastic. you can upgrade your windows 8.1 for free from windows store (maybe you need to install some updates first. look up on Microsoft's website for instructions). the dual graphics are awesome, i ran the battlefield 4 and call of duty 10 all in high quality, the fps are round 59 to 60. it is way better than alienware 14.the only problem is i really do not appreciate the usb ports design, is you use a wired mice, it would be awful.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Know what you're getting into when you buy this computer", "Author": "Benjamin Wood", "ReviewID": "RP2INFKR0NXQ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I treat it as it was designed, a gaming laptop.That means that you will have to deal with a few things that are to be expected of a console,Non-existent battery life (An hour)No gaming performance on battery (with the exception of tetris.

Wendelbo\"", "ReviewID": "R2PSFWBE2WNRVR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I just bought two of these computers - it was time to upgrade. We had actually bought two Dell computers, but they performed so poorly (despite similar specs) that we returned them and replaced them with these Y510P beauties.Now, we are both big time gamers and that is the purpose we got these for. We also use them for our research and home entertainment, where they are clearly overkill.Among the games we expected these to run well are Starcraft II, Crysis 3, Total War Rome and Civ V. Because we are suckers for beautiful graphics (and because we don't like breaking our bank on truly high end gaming laptops) we opted for getting the second graphics card in the Ultrabay. So, to be clear, this laptop works in an SLI configuration, which improves graphics drastically in very heavy games. For the past several hours I have been playing Crysis 3 in the native, full resolution with all graphics or high or above - with the graphics this computer delivers in the SLI setup it is simply an incredible experience. Without knowing the exact frame rate, I can tell you it was well into the land of diminishing returns - I don't need a higher frame rate. Crysis 3 is among the most graphics heavy games out there at the moment, so if this runs well, almost anything if not everything on the market at the moment will as well. Starcraft II and CIV V, both maxed our on all settings, look stunning.On performance in general - although not a perfect measure, the windows experience index (WEI) is a decent indication of hardware capabilities. On this laptop they are as follow (out of 9.9):Processor: 7.6Memory: 7.7Graphics: 7.5Gaming graphics (like 3d and gaming): 7.5Primary hard disk: 5.9That makes the overall WEI a 5.9 because the \"weakest link\" (subscore), in this case the hard drive, ends out as the overall score. Be aware, though, that this \"bottleneck\" doesn't actually affect your game experience much. Compared to a 7200 rpm hard drive, or an SSD, you will take slightly longer to load a game, but once it is loaded the hard drive will not be so slow as to change your game experience. Exceptions to this rule are large open world games where the computer doesn't load a full level at the beginning, but instead does so on the run - in that case you could experience a SLIGHTLY better experience with the 7200 rpm drive, but a significant improvement with the SSD. But, in my mind not one that is worth the few hundred bucks more a large SSD will cost you (unless you want improvements in hard drive speed for reasons other than gaming, such as frequently moving around large files). In all other aspects, the y510p performs very, very well.On other aspects than performance:This computer is pretty heavy for its class, as should be expected from the hardware it contains - two dedicated graphics cards, for example. That means it is by no means impossible to transport, but it is not an ultra-book. Don't expect to effortlessly throw it around in a should bag - the power transformer is the size of a brick, and weighs thereafter as well. So, if you are not out to get a laptop for its raw power, you are much better off with another device - one that is easier to transport and is smaller. That is why I say in the title that this is not an office PC.The laptop itself is absolutely stunning - but, of course, that is a matter of taste. It makes a statement with its bold corner shape and bright red keys (even when the back light of the keyboard is off), but I personally like that. The black, brushed surface, though, I imagine almost anyone will find beautiful and refined. It IS unfortunately a fingerprint magnet, and they are difficult to wipe off. But, I don't notice them unless someone else is handling the computer.On the software end, unfortunately Lenovo has left behind a bit of its legacy by including a bunch of bloatware (whether they were paid to or not, I do not know) and that is annoying, but 5 minutes of work will get rid of it all. They DO include a windows start button replacement which recreates the look of the start menu in Windows 7 and older, which I dearly miss in windows 8 (even with the update to Windows 8.1), and it works well.Overall, especially considering this very reasonable price tag of 999 dollars, we are incredibly happy with our purchase. We have bought a three year warranty (not accident plan) - With three years of warranty and this kind of hardware, we are sure to have great computers for the foreseeable future.", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "I did a great deal of research before I settled on this Lenovo.  I am quite satisfied with it and would recommend it to others.", "Author": "Robert S. Hanenberg \"Bob\"", "ReviewID": "RA1OFL1VNLJQ7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The computer I am reviewing is a Lenovo IdeaPad Y510p with one terabyte of disk space and eight gigabytes of RAM.  This model does not necessarily come with a CD disk drive, but you can get one, built in if you want. The computer runs on Windows 8.  Windows 8 has two interfaces, one a rather traditional Windows interface and the other designed for touch screens.  This model comes with a touch screen if you want it, but I did not opt for it.  I bought the computer directly from Lenovo in the United States.  Lenovo computers are also sold by Amazon.com, but if you want to specify the features of your computer, you should probably look at the Lenovo web-site as well as Amazon.A review of a computer risks stressing the wrong things.  The design and feel of the computer is important, but it is not the main thing.  The main thing is the software, which is not so much Lenovo's responsibility as Microsoft's.  Still, the hardware maker can screw up the software in various ways, so software is worth talking about in a review of a computer.I will first talk about the physical design of the Lenovo, then about the software, and then about how I migrated from my old computer to the Lenovo.  I will compare my experience with Lenovo to a recent experience with a Hewlett-Packard, which you can read about in more detail in a separate review.Physically, the Lenovo is satisfactory.  At least for the moment.  The test is how long it lasts, but I will not know this until much later.  I had a Dell computer for nine years, and only towards the end did it show signs of instability.  Nine years is pretty good.  There is no way of knowing whether the Lenovo will last that long.  The CD drive looks rather flimsy to me, but that is just an impression.The Lenovo has a nice feel.  The keyboard is both soft and sensitive.  It lights up in deep red, so you can see the keys at night.  The screen plays DVDs in bright colors.  The audio input port accepts stereo, which most new computers do not.  The computer comes to life quickly, like a Mac, and unlike earlier computers based on Windows.Having an audio input port which supports stereo was important to me.  In shopping for a computer, I got wrong information about the audio input ports from Hewlett-Packard, Dell and Toshiba.  The Lenovo salespeople admitted they did not know.  So I emailed the technical people at Lenovo and asked them if the sound card supported stereo.  Someone wrote back: \"Yes, it does.\"  And it does.Another thing I like is the external stereo speakers.  Although they are small, they sound very good, especially because when you work on a laptop you sit with your face within less than a foot of them.  I usually hook up my laptop to a stereo system, but I found that now sometimes I simply listen to the little speakers on the Lenovo.  This is nice when I want to work in a place without larger speakers.Now, the software.  I was able to use much of the software I had on my old Dell computer, which operated under Vista.  A few old programs did not work, but I suppose perfect backward compatibility for all programs is too much to ask.  Adobe software, both visual and sound software, originally bought for Vista, worked in Windows 8.  This was a nice surprise, because you cannot buy that software anymore.  Adobe now has you renting it by the month or year.  I am pleased with myself that I kept the original installation files and the activation keys.Even my beloved Oxford English Dictionary works with Windows 8.  At first it did not.  When I tried to install it it did not work.  I ask OED what to do and they sent me a patch, which worked.  This is admirable, because the publisher of the OED is not a huge multinational corporation.  Compare this with Hewlett-Packard, a huge multinational corporation, which does not supply a driver so that my old LaserJet printer can work on Windows 8.  This means that I will have to throw out a perfectly good laser printer.  Why is it that a tiny organization takes the time to help you keep your copy of the Oxford English Dictionary, while Hewlett-Packard cannot be bothered to make a driver for one of its printers.  I used to say that I would not buy a laser printer from anyone but HP, because their printers are work-horses which perform flawlessly for years.  Now I have to say that they perform flawlessly until you change your operating system.Now I will compare my experience in setting up the Lenovo with the experience I had a few weeks ago setting up a new HP computer, which I have since sent back.  One of the problems I had with the HP was transferring my emails and contacts in Outlook from the old to the new computer.  I could not do it, and the HP technical people, who seemed to me very smart, could not do it either.  But I had no trouble doing it myself on the Lenovo.  I do not know why.  One possibility (unlikely, but it is the only thing I can think of) is that HP left out or changed some of the components of the operating system.  I know they left out at least one piece of software when they shipped my computer (a program for playing DVDs).  But this is different from changing the operating system.  The reason will probably stay a mystery.  But the fact remains that I had no trouble transferring the Outlook data from my old computer to the Lenovo, all by myself.At any rate, I have not found anything left out of the Lenovo.  In fact, it may have too much unwanted software on it.  Sometimes when you click on a file, the default program turns out to be something they want to sell you.  When I clicked on a PDF file, I expected it  to appear in Acrobat.  Instead I got some other program, which told me that my computer had been \"backdated\".  I think that means that someone changed the date for fraudulent purposes, but that was not the case.  I had to download Acrobat and change the default program for PDF files.On the other hand, I rather liked the fact that the Lenovo came with trial anti-virus software, and with a trial copy of Windows Office.  It was nice to have these programs at the outset, especially the anti-virus program, so I could get right to work.  I can decide to replace these programs with others later, if I want.Curiously, I had an administrative problem paying for the Lenovo computer.  Neither the Lenovo website nor customer service on the telephone would accept my credit card.  I am not the kind of person whose credit card gets refused.  I had the credit card people and the Lenovo people together with me on conference calls several times, to no avail.  Lenovo insisted the credit card people were to blame and vice-versa.  I suspect from various conversations with the Lenovo staff that Lenovo is the victim of so much fraud that it has over-protected its financial systems.  They advised me to use Amazon Payments or Paypal.  It turned out that the Paypal option had been discontinued, and the billing department hadn't been informed.  However, Amazon Payments did work.  But the process of paying wasted a good deal of time.  At one point Lenovo seriously suggested that I send them a cashier's check.  The fact that they had a policy about this which their staff was clearly familiar with made me wonder how many other people had trouble paying.  I have used my credit card on-line many times since I bought the Lenovo, without incident.In short, the Lenovo is not perfect.  Given the complexity of personal computers, the fact that we want them for data manipulation, writing, communications and entertainment all at once, means that nothing can even approach perfection.  But so far I am satisfied with my new Lenovo, and would recommend it to others.", "Date": "November 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "More like 4.5 stars to be fair", "Author": "Aaron Fox", "ReviewID": "R591A3QBQIXRN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was going to give it 5 stars but I didn't want anyone to get the impression that this was a perfect laptop. I've owned this for about a month now so this is all basically first impressions.I'll start by listing the few CONS:-Fingerprint magnet like no other. It is less noticeable over time but when I touched it for the first time, I might as well had white paint on my hands.-Trackpad is hard to get used to and generally hard to use. The buttons are merged with the pad which makes it move the cursor. It is just generally poorly designed. I was surprised by this because I've used other Lenovo products and they don't have the same trackpad issues.-Not really a con but something that should be mentioned: The power brick is much larger. I suppose this is to be expected considering it runs 165W.-Gets warm(this was expected). I haven't even played any games but I use it for RDP sessions and serious multi-tasking. It actually wasn't as bad as I thought it would be with the dual GPUs.- 0 key on my keyboard is buggy. It get stuck randomly. Has been like that out of the box. I'm sure this is just a quality control issue and not typical.-A lot of bloatware. I've removed some of it. I guess I was just expecting this to be a thing of the past- since this has been my first laptop buy in 5+ years.PROS:-Fast-Long battery life for a gaming laptop(3 hours, pushed to 4 if you dim the back light)-Illuminated keyboard is just as nice as you would want it to be.-Decently slim, compact, not too heavy(relative to a gaming/workstation laptop).-Everything worked out of the box with no problems. Seems to be solid enough for transportation in a bag or backpack.Other:-If you get the 8GB SSD catch + 1TB drive, the speed increase from the SSD part is defiantly noticeable.-I've run VMWare Workstation with ESXi running as a VM. Worked perfectly. My only problem was when the laptop went to sleep, it would disable the network interface and ESXi seemed to be unable to reconnect. It was just for lab purposes.Overall Impression:Good laptop for the price. Has some issues which need to be taken into consideration before buying. Portable laptop mouse is highly recommended.", "Date": "April 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Value For The Money", "Author": "Ryan Brown", "ReviewID": "R1SZKHRM9M0MQP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm giving this laptop 4 stars because despite all of its greatness, it does still have a few quirks you should be aware of.I did a lot of research and comparing before buying this laptop, and by no means am I thinking I made the wrong choice.Pros:Size - For me, 17 inches is way too big, and anything below 13 is way too small. This size is very nice to transport, not bulky at all, and its not very heavy compared to other gaming laptops I've handled.Screen - A lot of laptops I found around this price range had 1366x768 resolution. For me, I have to have 1080p. Anything less just looks like garbage. Finding a a laptop with a 1080p screen for this price was a huge pro for buying this laptop.Performance - The dual 750m's in this laptop can be quite impressive. With some tweaking, you can run battlefield 4, bioshock infinite, borderlands 2, and a lot of other high end games on this little powerhouse. In most games it performs a little worse than my old radeon 6870, which is astonishing. The added i7 makes a huge difference. Definitely spend the extra money and get the i7 over the i5. If you plan on keeping this for any length of time, you'll be happy you went for the quad core.Outside - Not the most important feature by any means, but a pleasant bonus buying this laptop. The metal casing feels sleek, the red backlit keyboard is the first thing people comment on when they see it. ICons:Screen - While the screen is 1080p, you sometimes get the feeling that not everything runs at 1080p. For example, google chrome looks a bit blurry, like its at a lower resolution. This seems really weird to me, and I've no idae how to fix it. Mind you, this isn't a huge deal. Also, the colors aren't as good looking as they could be.Performance - This laptop comes with the Geforce Experience program, which can be used to configure the graphics settings for many games to what nvidia recommends. However, I've noticed that in a few games, nvidia is a bit optimistic about the performance. For example, it says it can run bioshock infinite on basically maximum settings. While standing still in the game, this is true. But once you start actually moving, the framerate jumps all over the place (dropping into the 10's in some parts, which if you know anything about games, is basically unplayable.) It also gets quite hot for your mouse hand when playing games.Battery - For a gaming laptop, obviously you shouldn't expect a long battery life. I get about 3 1/2 hours for normal, non gaming use. Some people might be turned off by this, but being a college student, I rarely am somewhere where I can't plug it in. however, the charger is also a bit larger than normal chargers. This isn't a big deal really, but just something to keep in mind.Trackpad - The trackpad is very sensitive, and takes some getting used to. If you use a mouse with this, you'll never notice it.Some extra thoughts:Having two graphics cards does come with a few hiccups. You have to shut down all open programs to activate or disable both cards. That's not really a problem, just an inconvenience. Also, some older games I've been playing, like the elder scrolls 4 oblivion, don't recognize both cards. And one 750m isn't very powerful. In that respect, getting a laptop with just one card (you could find one with a 765m, same processor and ram for around the same price, maybe a little more) might be a safer bet. I also recommend not using the geforce experience other than to keep your graphics drivers up to date and configuring graphics settings in games yourself, using something like fraps to monitor your fps. If you want to play at higher resolutions, you can go into the nvidia control panel-manage 3d settings-and set the adaptive vsync (last option in the list) to half the refresh rate. This locks the framerate to 30 fps, which makes the game run more smoothly with less framerate jumps. Or if you don't mind running games at a lower resolution, that's another option.I highly recommend this laptop. Finding a laptop with this kind of performance at this price is nearly impossible. I've enjoyed this laptop immensely since I've bought it. There are just a few quirks people should know about.", "Date": "February 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great machine for the price", "Author": "Bobberton Esq. the III", "ReviewID": "R2PLO12OGIF6MM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this as a gift. For the most part, I am very happy with it, but had to work on it over a few days to get it configured to my liking. More later. Let's go over the pros.The GOOD:- Hardware-wise, this laptop is a steal at this price point. Nothing can really touch it in terms of power for a grand. Update the graphics driver and be sure to enable SLI in the nVidia control panel as it may not turn on automatically. I can play any modern game on this without a problem. For example, I can play the newest Tomb Raider with everything maxed (minus the fancy hair thing) and get a respectable 30+ frames per second. Impressive.- The brushed aluminum is quite nice despite it being a fingerprint-magnet. Cool to the touch when the machine is off.- Looks professional despite its power. Its powerful, but subtle about it - not riced out with gaming foo foo everywhere. I appreciate that.- The ultrabay is actually really neat. I picked up a hard drive adapter for it when I am not utilizing the second card. You can also get a DVD drive for it as well if you need one. Handy to have. While its just as easy to get USB accessories of these as well (external hard drive or enclosure, DVD Burner), its nice to not have to use up extra space in my bag if I just grab whatever ultrabay thing I want that day, plug it in, and just go.- The matte Full HD (1080p) screen is beautiful, with good viewing angles. At 15.6\", 1080p looks incredible. So tired of glossy screens.- Blacklit keyboard is handy in the dark. Can be activated and deactivated with the function key and space at any time. The keyboard itself is comfortable and a pleasure to type on.- Speakers sound great for laptop speakers. Don't ever kid yourself into thinking laptop speakers will be as good as what you have on your desktop, however.- Always-On USB ports are a nice touch. This allows you to turn off your laptop completely and charge any USB devices you have plugged in. Good thinking, Lenovo.- I like the boot menu button a lot. It's a nice not having to figure out what function key to hit during startup.The BAD:- Windows 8. This is, quite honestly, the worst thing about this laptop. Windows 8 is clearly an operating system for tablets and game consoles. Honestly, this has no place on here nor on a desktop. No. Windows 8.1 is a free upgrade, however, and is slightly better about it, as it adds in some options to start straight to desktop, but is still a far cry from Windows 7. Luckily I'm a college student and was able to get a \"free\" legitimate copy of Windows 7 off of Dreamspark. If you're a poweruser, consider this \"downgrade\" to Windows 7. Otherwise, just download Windows 8.1 from the Microsoft \"App\" store.- Windows 8 UEFI. I'm used to having my Windows key available to me in case I need to do a fresh install. The way Windoze 8 is installed here, you do not have access to your key (unless you use third-party software to \"find\" it for you). This is pretty irritating. MAKE AN IMAGE OF YOUR DRIVE BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING (like transferring to an SSD) as the recovery partition didn't work for me (more later).- Touchpad is as bad as I read before buying this. It seems to have difficulty telling between moving the mouse, touch-clicking, and dragging, as it tries desperately to do all these things simultaneously. It appears to be a Windows driver issue, as it functions perfectly in Linux. The included Windows driver is hilariously bad. Kill it with fire and download the latest one from Synaptics and it will be better, but still not great. I'm a little surprised that Lenovo allowed an otherwise awesome machine to ship with such an embarrassing issue. Regardless, I still got this laptop because I usually carry a mouse with me anyway.- Only three USB ports. I'm not the guy that has to have everything plugged in all the time, but for those of you that do, consider getting yourself a hub.- The hard drive is only 5400RPM. In plain English, this is as slow as drives go these days. On the positive end, it is a full terabyte and boots relatively fast (since it is a hybrid SSHD, but not as fast as an SSD). However, being that I'm on the go all the time, I really benefit from an SSD. Unfortunately, the cloning process to an SSD failed, and for some reason, the recovery partition didn't work for me. Worse, since Lenovo doesn't give you the Windows key, nor any recovery disks, I was not able to restore the drive to factory. By that point, I was already pretty peeved with Win 8 anyway, so I just did a fresh install of Windows 7 X64 on an SSD and everything is wonderful. The terabyte drive is now living in my ultrabay caddy and used when I don't need the second video card.- Battery life is pretty short, but if you're looking at laptops with this kind of hardware, this isnt really an issue. Browsing the web or working on homework gets me around three hours. With the wifi off and screen dimmed down you may be able to hit three and a half. To reach four, you'd need to remove the second video card and enable Intel's Optimus. Unfortunately, Optimus doesn't work if you have SLI.- During heavy use, like gaming, it will get HOT. I'm talking 75+ degrees Celcius. That is unfortunate. If you plan on gaming heavily on this, I'd consider throwing down a couple tens on a good cooling stand like a Zalman or Cooler Master.Will the computer explode if you don't? No.UPDATE - took a few hours to change the stock thermal paste with some Arctic Silver 5. I'm getting about 5C less from both the CPU and GPU at full load.

Right out of the box, the track pad is trash. The mouse button in part of the track pad so it is almost impossible to click something without moving the pointer. Anyways, I found out that it isn't the trackpad, it's the driver. To fix this, I just uninstalled the current driver, installed the one from Synaptics, and set a \"deadzone\" on the mouse so the button is not considered part of the track pad. The new driver also gives the user better control so you can really tinker with the settings. Now, the trackpack is fantastic. Another issue is that it runs pretty hot when playing games or movies. This isn't that intolerable, but if you live in a hot climate and plan on having it on your lap, I'd recommend a cooling pad.Third, it is bulky as hell. I have a Targus bag for a 15.6\" laptop and it's a squeeze to get this laptop in the bag. When you do get it in there, it's heavy as hell and really wears on your shoulder after awhile. The power block is literally the size of a brick, and pretty heavy also. If you're looking for portability, then this is not the laptop for you. Lucky for me, I don't plan on lugging it around with me too much so the size is something I was completely expecting with the amount of hardware inside of this machine.Finally, the battery life is subpar. I found that you can increase it by shutting off the SLI and lowering the screen brightness, but even then you are only looking at less than 3.5 hours. This means you have to lug that power brick around with you if you are going to be using it away from home. It also means that you're gonna be screwed if you don't have an outlet nearby.

Glad I did because the IdeaPad is exactly what I wanted.I took the second graphics card out of the ultrabay and put a Samsung 840EVO SSD in. It was very simple to do that and the SSD is clicking along fine. I am still able to play any game that I have tried on medium graphic settings. I was worried that the SSD would not work with the ultrabay, but if you buy a caddy here on Amazon it will work perfectly. I kept the hard drive in place for storage and boot from the SSD in the ultrabay. No problems at all.The keyboard is a joy to type on. I am a teacher and I use the laptop for school in addition to using it at home so it gets a lot of attention. Once I figured out where all of the keys (things like the arrows, function, volume, etc.) were on the keyboard it was an easy adjustment. The \"feel\" of the keyboard is excellent, the keys are spaced perfectly. I also like the red backlighting (which is adjustable). I am a big guy with large hands and the keyboard is comfortable to me whereas many keyboards feel very small and typing on them is difficult.Some reviewers have disliked the trackpad. I don't use it, so I can't really comment on that. I am not a fan of trackpads in general so I use a Performance MX mouse.The laptop is blazing fast (no doubt assisted by the SSD) and the screen is beautiful. Of course, much like buying a new car, everyone will have a different opinion about things.

The built in main 750M is okay for most models (however many are factory defective and does not have thermal paste applied properly), however the Ultrabay VGA may be a deal breaker for many people.The 650M in the Ultrabay can operate on relative acceptable temps (max 176F-185F), however the higher clocked 750M (and also the 755M) with higher core voltage will reach 208F in a matter of minutes and starts to throttle with GPU intensive games, like Crysis 3, Bioshock Infinite, Witcher 2, etc.The reason for this is that the Ultrabay in this model was designed for 650M, which means:a) The fan is too smallb) Technically there is almost no point where the fan could take in air, there is only a small hole at the bottom of the laptopc) There is an aluminium casing inside, surrounding the Ultrabay slot which will eventually overheat and retain the heatI have to note that even though the Ultrabay VGA reaches throttle temperature, the ultrabay fan will not start to work on maximum RPM, currently the only way to use the fans on maximum RPM is to use the dust removal service in the Lenovo software. Running the fans on maximum would help the ultrabay vga, but Lenovo does not allow it, probably because the laptop would be too loud and people would complain because of that.Repasting the ultrabay vga will not do anything. A notebook cooler can help to lower the cpu and built in VGA temp, but it will not help the Ultrabay VGA, it only makes it reach throttle temp slower.In short: A beast of a laptop regarding speed, however the Ultrabay slot is not designed to hold a 750M/755M and the VGA inside it will overheat with any game that utilize 99% of the VGA.It is okay with games like Skyrim and X-Com EU, but Crysis 3, Bioshock Infinite, Witcher 2, etc will fry the Ultrabay.

I will just go into the basics.The wifi card might as well have been DOA. It cannot hold a solid connection for more than a minute for me. Lenovo is known for having cheap wifi solutions in their computers so I was not too surprised. I picked up a usb network adapter and am now happily connected to the internet.My only other gripe with the computer is the placement of the ports. On the left side of the laptop, there are 2 usb ports right next to each other and then the HDMI port is right next to those. I did not see this as an issue until I plugged in my HDMI cable and noticed that it does not leave a lot of room for the middle usb slot. I had a cooling pad plugged into that slot but it did not fit once the HDMI was plugged in so I had to use an extender usb cable. Not a big deal but just something to think about.The computer itself is a beast. With the dual graphics cards I am able to run skyrim at ultra with absolutely no hiccups. She gets a little warm so I would recommend getting a laptop cooling pad, but if not you should be fine as long as you don't play for 10 hours straight. Mine came with a 25 gig SSD which I hear is hit or miss, so I prepared myself to not get one and was pleasantly surprised when it was included. Always nice to be able to play Skryim or Fallout with zero load times.keyboard is nice and solid feeling. Good response from the keys. The trackpad leaves a lot to be desired but I use a mouse so again it is a non issue for me. Lighted keyboard comes with 2 settings and looks great. Speakers sound FANTASTIC. I was very surprised by them and would be able to use them by themselves while traveling and not have any gripes.Honestly, everything in this computer runs like a charm besides the wifi card. That issue is why I took 1 star off.If you are considering this computer, then pull the trigger.

Out of the box running 8.0 is fine just do simple updates and you are good, however if upgrading to 8.1 you better be ready to update drivers from Lenova website and any oem that is associated with your laptop. Now this is not Lenova full blam; Microsoft has alot to do with 8.1 problems in general but just do your homework. Anyway after the last big update for 8.1 and me doing many fine grain tweaks, I have this laptop running like a BEAST. Unlike alot of peaple I use my laptop as a desktop replacement (supplementing my ps4 in my gaming set-up), so my laptop sits far away from my monitor and runs alot  longer than normal however with a good lap cooler( CM Storm SF-19) its just fine.

Read Mehhh!", "Author": "Yves Saint Lawrence d'Arabia", "ReviewID": "R1AHEO6Y9I6CE7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This laptop, as pointed by many others, has one of the best price/performance ratios out there. I won't reiterate the obvious facts too much, but rather try to disclose some of my findings from my experience of about 5 months of use.The speaker is nice... but just fails to cross the finish line by a couple of steps. It can produce by quite high volume, sound without distortion and it has Dolby surround sound feature which you can turn on to give quite a nice immersion in movies. Unfortunately, it won't fill the necessity of a dedicated speaker because the speaker system doesn't consist a subwoofer (no boom boom) and hence makes the tempo-reliant electronic musics I listen to rather floaty and weightless. And after seeing the Youtube video \"Summer Sea Sky Sound Subwoofer\" by a Youtuber of great musical taste, I quite want my lows please.The computer is by unanimity, pretty fast, but I imagine you quite expect power saving feature for those light and prolonged task sessions like word processing, and it has \"Lenovo Energy Management\" software which has a \"Bicycle\" mode out of 3 modes (the other two being a car and a billet train), indicating most power-efficient mode. The Bicycle mode pretty much limits the CPU clock around 700 MHz and in windows 8.1 , this energy management software doesn't seem to be refined enough because when you revert it back to \"Bullet Train\" mode, the clock limit still seems to be present. That makes for a very frustrating rest of the session as your mouse arrow may become unresponsive and screen may freeze for some time and so on. And if you force shut the PC and restart it, I encountered instances where the issue isn't resolved. So basically I had to make a custom power plan outside of Lenovo's software and in windows with maxed setting and apply that to solve that problem. To be concise, Lenovo's an IBM company, one of the founder of the personal computing, but I guess no amount of experience can teach a company not willing to perfect their trade.The good thing about the looks is it's a formal looking laptop although being gamer in nature. That makes it versatile for public presentations and DJing and other stuff that I can't imagine doing in something like Asus Gxx series or iBuyPower (are they even serious?) laptops.This does have 2 USB 3.0 ports.The wireless card \"Intel centrino BS\" (it's not like they've used that word for processor class... jeesh with proprietary words that give impressions of innovation...) is very very underwhelming. About as much reception as an iPod 5th gens. I am not even kidding. It is fact that my MediaLink 300 Mbps router, the one that others love so much, sucks in terms of range and stability (there's a review for that from me), but if the laptop does as good as an iPod's at around the same range, that speaks volume about it's efficacy. Also there isn't a physical switch for the wireless card and that surely fits with the pattern of shortcomings for this card.The trackpad. Absolutely disastrous. It's hypersensitive, so much so that a speck of dust can cause it to register 2 finger \"tap tap\" motion that just sends the cursor \"Apeshiiet!\" The hypersensitivity occasionally also throws the cursor off the mark when you mean to click by tapping, which makes it unusable on an unoptimized software for 1080p screen like Virtual DJ Pro, with its minuscule icons that can lead to a disaster in a live performance due to unintended inputs. Ever seen a DJ with a mouse for computer? Well, this will make that a thing. The only cool thing with this trackpad is that it gives a nice sound and tactile feel when you \"tap-click\" as it depresses a bit. Over all, I'd prefer the trackpad of my old $300 Gateway laptop.Came out to be longer of a review than expected, meh. But, as you see, many of these problems are situational and solvable easily by use of a mouse or USB wireless card  and other sensible things. The laptop overall is a very good value and does gaming, media related tasks quite nicely (scores very high in Cinebench benchmark) and pretty much everything nicely too, consequently. If you are wondering why I don't have the \"Amazon Verified Purchase\", I bought this from Newegg as they wouldn't charge sales tax and was the same price as Amazon's by the time of purchase (probably shouldn't be saving this but I'll take the chances to save you about $90).

I found out you cannot replace the network card with a better model because Lenovo locked the bios, the laptop refuses to even turn on. The Intel Centrino N2230 network card is very low end to start with, it is only single band and the fact that Lenovo purposely preventing you to upgrade the network card unless you buy their more expensive option shows what they're trying to pull. (You can still swap your HDD and RAMs however.) You have to find a way to install a third party bios, but when you pay big money for their hardware, it's disappointing when you don't have control of what you purchased. Mind you I am not new to this, I have been using and repairing other laptops in the past from companies such as HP and Sony which also employ the same bios locking, but perhaps I was being naive this time.My model doesn't come with an mSATA connector (which allow you to install a solid state drive in addition to the main internal harddrive), this is true for other buyers who didn't opt for SSD options. I mean even if you didn't purchase one with SSD option, at least Lenovo should be nice enough to solder on the mSATA connector in case you want to install it manually. (You can still replace the main internal harddrive with \"MLC\" solid state drives, but then you don't get to have two internal drives, which is actually the norm for laptops at this price range.) This is not true of the past when Lenovo did included mSATA connector for the Y480/Y580 and earlier models (even if you don't purchase SSD options). The laptop already cost more than a grand, they chose to milk as much money from you as possible by excluding a hardware part that cost a buck at most (not to mention couldn't add a fourth USB port onto this humongous thing).Otherwise it is a very good laptop, albeit quite large and heavy for the 15\" category. I have the SLI GPUs (dual graphic cards) option so it is great for gaming. I am running Windows 7 with the latest nVidia drivers and SLI work without problems. In term of price to performance to ratio, this is still one of the best option comparing to the competitions.If you run the laptop by default and doesn't disable Intel Turbo Boost, then it will get pretty hot. Long gaming session can get the CPU to over 90*C. However, this is not an issue for me after disabling Turbo Boost, afterward even after long gaming session, the CPU and both GPUs stays below 70*C. There are instructions you can find to disable Turbo Boost or you can use a program called ThrottleStop.I enjoy the chiclet keyboard very much, its very responsive and quiet. I don't use the Touchpad so it doesn't apply to me, I prefer a good laser mouse. Overall, it is a relatively quiet laptop, not silent mind you. You will hear the fans, but it's very tolerable with a lower pitch humming tone. Even during gaming it's not so bad. It's not quiet enough to sleep next to though.While some of the things I mentioned are not major issues, continuing to buy from them is to persuade them to continue this behavior of tricking their customers. Mind you Lenovo's record of customer service isn't stellar either. There are other good options to chose from such as Asus which I wish I had taken a look at before diving for this one.PS. I highly recommend 'not' to get the Y410p model. Unlike the Y510p, the Y410p have very poor durability. It's lid is extremely flimsy plastic and you can flex the entire chassis of the laptop without effort. This is disappointing from Lenovo since their previous Y480 model was very durable. The Y510p fortunately have a metal lid (though still somewhat flexy) and the chassis is at least somewhat durable.PPS. I am well aware you can swap the Lenovo's Ultrabay (ie. the removable DVD drive or secondary graphic card) with a removable harddrive bay. However, this mean you will have to swap out your removable graphic card, defeating the purpose of getting an SLI GPUs laptop in the first place.", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Outstanding For the Price Tag", "Author": "Timothy J.
