Or weight and size, so I'll skip those too.This product works.We use one at our retail store and its has been dropped, stepped on, and spilled on, and its still going strong. The lack of pre-installed bloatware is refreshing, and it has performed reliably under heavy use. Definitely reccomend to anyone who puts a lot of wear and tear on their computer.", "Date": "February 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice laptop, NO BLOATWARE!", "Author": "T.
