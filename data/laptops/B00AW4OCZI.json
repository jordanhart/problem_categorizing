Barber", "ReviewID": "R3CF3PCARP3PA8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this T-series Ultrabook for its processing power, memory, storage, and 1366x768 pixel display. I intended to use it for image editing in the field for photography. Indeed it runs Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom effortlessly. The problem is the display. The useable viewing angle is so narrow that even with the screen carefully adjusted the image color will vary from top to bottom of the display. If you move your head a little off center you can easily make the highlights blow out or the shadows block. There is no way two people can view the screen simultaneously and get decent image quality. This is probably ok for casual viewing but for image editing it is unusable.I worked with Sony support and they gave me many possible fixes--reinstalling the video driver, updating the driver, resetting the BIOS, and more. All had no effect. Their final judgement was: \"The issue is not regarding the display of your laptop, In LCD display angle of view is limited and the color varies when you look from a different angle.\" This may be true of this LCD display, but certainly not all LCD displays. I would love to have the display quality of my $500 iPad.", "Date": "September 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good as I expected.", "Author": "Daniel", "ReviewID": "R3G8JPH5PLL1D5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I strongly recommend this product.
