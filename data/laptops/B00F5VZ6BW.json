I am no longer fascinated with the \"touch screen\".  Now that the shine has worn off, Tablets are just very large smart phones that don't function as a phone, They have very poor storage and if I get the stupid adobe doesn't mix with fruit page one more time, I'm going to breath fire.  I wanted a laptop that was focused on media. Not gaming.  Just media.  Movies, music and internet.  So after an exhaustive search I settled on the Lenovo Z710.Pros: Keyboard.  its a Lenovo so the keyboard is as good as can be expected in a laptop.  Screen resolution of 1080p.  JBL speakers.  Great, clear sound.  I can hear this throughout my apartment.  720p webcam  Intel i5  1 TB of HDCons: Some people will fuss about the touch screen.  eh.  Its a PC so it does PC things like run virus software checks and has a little bloat ware.I would buy this again and am very excited about my purchase.  For those who just want a good computer and don't want to pay over $1000 to get it.  Look no further.  This thing is packed with actual desirable features.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "great", "Author": "Laurence M.", "ReviewID": "R3G37AQNLVR675", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the product is perfect, the use environment is dynamic but windows 8 is somewhat complicated at first, but is an excellent choice for a laptop under $ 1000", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pretty Good", "Author": "Forznoles \"forznoles\"", "ReviewID": "RKDGKQDSU4D4V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pretty good computer for the money - plenty of storage space on the hard drive, etc.  We are adjusting to Windows 8, but that's not a computer issue - that's a Microsoft issue.  The screen is nice and the keyboard as well.  So far we are having issues finding a good headset with microphone as the computer has one of those newer combo headphone/mic jacks, so older headphone/microphones with two outputs for PCs will need a splitter to work with this computer.  Plus, we are looking for a second power cord cheaply.  Our only real complaint is that the Lenovo website isn't very user-friendly to help you with your computer - if you type the model number into the Lenovo website to browse for accessories, it doesn't even recognize the computer's model number - very strange.  Overall, however, we are pleased with the computer and we hope to get a lot of life out of it.  We took it straight to a computer pro who removed the bloatware and transferred over our music, emails, etc.  I would recommend that if you have a lot of data to transfer over to this new computer.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Entertainment Laptop ... with a few small qualms", "Author": "M. Hatlestad", "ReviewID": "R27RLLWTVIME99", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:Crisp ScreenLarge, backlit KeyboardOverall good performanceNice Form Factor (looks nice, not fat, not ridiculously heavy)Crisp, 1920 x 1080 displayGood speakers (Dolby mixer is surprisingly nice)Wakes up quickly when opening lidOverall Good PerformanceCons:Graphics Driver has issues with certain games. With Civ V, it has a blue screen of death TDR Graphics Driver Failure when starting up the DirectX 10/11 version that I haven't been able to fix, despite updating to the latest drivers and changing power settings. Have had one or two TDR failures in other games, though they are not consistent.5400 Hard-Drive is the biggest bottleneck for performance, which is completely stupid, since the rest of the hardware is otherwise good. Will definitely replace once I can budget it.Booting up can take a bit... but most likely due to the HDTrack pad is disappointing, but since this is a desktop replacement, you should be using a mouse anyways.Screen viewing angles are a bit smallFunction keys require pressing an extra button... makes auto-saving a bit more annoying.Summary:This is a great entertainment desktop replacement laptop. It is great for watching movies and plays most games well. It has great performance that is hindered by driver issues and a sub-par hard drive, which is really a shame.Despite my qualms, if you want a portable gaming/entertainment station for under $800, I would highly recommend this laptop.", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Intel Core i5-4200M 2.5 GHz Processor (3 MB Cache)\n6 GB DDR3 RAM\n1 TB 5400 rpm Hard Drive\n17.3-Inch Screen, NVIDIA GeForce GT745M Discrete Graphics\nWindows 8, 4-hour battery life", "Name": "Lenovo IdeaPad Z710 59387522 17.3-Inch Laptop (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DRCnvA8rL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00F5VZ6BW"}}
