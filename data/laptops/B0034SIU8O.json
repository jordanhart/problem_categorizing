My office laptop is a dell laptop. I was sick of the quality of those laptops and looking for something that is reliable. I am hoping this one is better. This laptop has very good looks. The finish looks awesome. Extra keys on the keyboards for the numbers help. Media buttons (no one really uses them) are not given. I bought a 3 year warranty from squaretrade for just 80$ (3 years). Do no buy warranty from this website. I am loving this laptop for the price I paid (510 after 15% bing cashback bought on [...]) With windows 7 (4GB and i3 processor) the laptop boots very fast, detects the wireless network and is ready for surging in less than a minute.
