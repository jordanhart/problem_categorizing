{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Tremendous space! Poor quality.", "Author": "J. Simon \"pbnhoney\"", "ReviewID": "RF5M2O1MQOCDX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this model 3.5 years ago from Best Buy. I took the 12 month warranty and upgraded the memory. Exactly 12 months and 2 days later bad things started to occur. It started \"eating\" power cords. I have bought about 10 in the last two years. The battery in the laptop died and I am not willing to put more money into this thing. The task bar at the bottom of the desktop would randomly die when the laptop was unplugged. I would close it and try to restart the task bar but it never repaired itself. I had trouble getting the updates from Windows to install and99% of them would not work after 12 months of ownership. I am pretty computer saavy but this thing was a nightmare.There is an excellent amount of space for music, movies and photos. I easily watched them at home and when traveling (the first tear when the battery worked). The laptop is also a poor quality. The area where you place your left and right hands on the computer cracked in year two. I have pretty small hands for a guy and I am not rough with them so clearly this thing is junk. I know everything I wrote is true about Toshiba because my wife has the A200 model and at the same time everything happened to hers. I would not recommended this laptop at all. I bought an Acer Netbook and its great their brand is less expensive.", "Date": "March 3, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000Y1QT1E"}}
