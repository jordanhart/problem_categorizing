I also like the fingerprint resistant surface, and the quick tab keys located at the top of the keyboard, which allow me to change the volume, or the brightness level of the screen.

Not really computer savy but tend to purchase lots of technology and have owned several pcs for work projects including Apple products. As a basic user who tends to search for jobs, read the news online, load pictures, and occassionally download music, this pc has been effective so far. The only annoyance is the mouse pad area which requires a bit of pressure to left/right click things. This laptop seems to be a test run for style because I don't think that mouse pad is effective even though it looks simple. A minor issue in my opinion so just take it as a finger work out. It's also very quiet and the music sounds ok once tweeked a bit.

The screen is gorgeous, the colors are lovely, the price is right for an array of excellent features. I dearly love my little guy, but he is no longer reliable (this matters to me because I use it for work and running statistical models). There is an electrical problem which forces the computer to randomly shut down (other customers have been told it is related to over heating). After looking up multiple potential ways to fix, I became aware the there are a LOT of people with HP laptops (a multitude of different HP laptops) that all have the same set of problems, including faulty/easy to break powercords.  That is all well and good, expected as no computer is perfect. I also have a macbook and have had problems with it over the years, but Apple has had, by and large, amazing customer support. HP on the other hand is the most awful, deviant company I have ever spoken to. After your 1 year warranty is up, they refuse to even talk to you. Unless you pay them an inordinate sum of money. Companies that do not stand by their products and repeatedly issue products with similar problems are dishonest and I will no longer be an HP customer after this.

I needed a replacement laptop for a Dell Inspiron 1721 (AMD Dual Core 1.9ghz), which stopped working and wouldn't boot up. I needed a 17\" because it is my \"desktop\" and my eyesight is not that good.  To say I got a great laptop is not doing this PC justice.  My Dell literally used to take 10 minutes to boot up.  This takes 15 seconds to get to the login page and 50 seconds to boot up completely.  I loaded the exact same software I had on my Dell.  This is very fast.  Another problem I had with my Dell was overheating.  When I took the Dell apart, there was dust accumulation so thick that there was 70% occlusion.  This HP has been running 27 degrees Celsius on standard apps/web-surfing and about 35 degrees Celsius on movies and game-play(using speed fan temperature monitor).  The fan rarely comes on and runs cool to touch.  It is incredibly light in comparison and the best feature is the HDMI (the Dell was missing HDMI).  I hook up the HDMI to my 32\" Toshiba Regza constantly to watch HD content and the transition is smooth and flawless.  Color comparisons are superb with no clarity loss.  The smudge-proof surface is nicely textured and--once you get used to it--the scroll features (vertical and horizontal) are not an issue.  One cool feature is the Synaptics Pointing Device.  With this enabled, I can use my mouse pad in fast-scroll and pinch/expand mode...big plus.  The one problem (small) is that the space bar--when tapped a bit to the right of center--does not always work.  I sometimes have to go back and place spaces between words (thank goodness for spell check!).  Overall, my happiness level is high with this laptop.  Several reviewers spoke of poor customer service.  I can't speak to this, but the new norm is \"poor\" unless you're dealing with Apple.  In my humble 30+ years of technology experience, companies come and go, customer service comes and goes.  You take the good with the bad and learn from mistakes.  That's why I DIDN'T choose a Dell (this time).", "Date": "December 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Gargantuan screen on a lightweight machine", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"eightrack\"", "ReviewID": "R270E2ITR6BTV3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A great all-purpose laptop for general computing needs.  It stays reasonably cool, and handles most standard computing tasks easily.  For the student or business person without intense processing needs, this is a perfect machine.Pros:* Lightweight.  For the size of this laptop, it feels surprisingly light.* Screen is huge and bright.  And at 1600x900, that extra space is usable.* Big hard drive, though I may upgrade to a 7200rpm or an SSD for performance.* 4GB of RAM out of the gate means it's not completely useless.  Upgrade to 8GB for the best performance, but 4GB gives you a very usable, responsive machine for most purposes.* Sound quality is pretty good.  You'll probably want some better speakers if you're using this as a desktop replacement, but it does fairly well on its own.* Dedicated numeric keypad is nice to have.Cons:* Video card is standard Intel afterthought. Fine for watching full-screened movies and playing flash games, but anything more demanding than that (ala games at native resolution, or 3D modeling work) will suffer a bit.* Touchpad is integrated into the body of the laptop, with very little delineation where it starts and the body ends.  It's essentially flush with the top of the palmrest, and made of the same material.  This makes scrolling and mousing a bit of a crapshoot, since by feel, it's very hard to know where the borders of the touchpad are.  The fact that the touchpad is not horizontally centered on the laptop (it's skewed to the left) adds to the frustration.  Regular use will probably make this a non-issue, but it certainly is an issue at the moment.All in all, a fine machine for the money.

Santa found it on a sale here at Amazon.My Daughter has used it mainly as a online browser, email, fb, etc. It does well for her usage....Then I tried it on my passion, Zynga games, Mafia Wars which requires several bookmarks and having many windows open while running scripts. I had been using a very expensive Dell laptop with games using Chrome and after opening 15-20 windows the Dell would crash. This HP will run over 20 screens including scripts that drains memory w/o crashing. I am trying to say that it does better than my $1500 Dell so far.I was a little concerned about the HP reputation as being described as many complaints on HP Customer Service. But as of over 2 months of use it performs very well and because of this I have not dealt with their Customer Service. It can't be any worse than Dell's CS.The keys and pad are quiet, no loud clicking and very soft. Long battery life for a 17 monitor. The only thing that I dislike is the mouse pad, as it is not visible and a bit of getting used to, but my daughter has not even noticed. Fan runs as needed but not that you notice any noise except on startup......I a not going to bore you with the specs as they are easily found under product description.

For a start the Intel 3-d card is near useless, any 3-d games you may run on it will cause the system to overheat & lock up within 30-40 minutes. I went out of my way to find a machine that didnt have the intel video card (like the 15\" version of this same notebook) because intel 3-d cards are not really 3-d cards. Unfortunately i believed the salesman when he told me that this one was configured the same as the 15\" model on display... lesson learned, always ALWAYS double check these things before-hand, & don't believe salesmen. I wont make that mistake again.Second the keyboard on this thing is dismal, the sharp corners of the keys will constantly trip up your fingertips, and it often misses your key presses. The touchpad is also problematic as it has the same texture as the rest of the laptops case, there are no borders or lines to tell you when your finger has run off the edge of it & it also constantly mis-interprets your inputs. The machine is also sorely lacking in USB ports, having only 3.Although this machine proudly bears an Altec Lansing badge, which might lead you to think that it at least has some quality speakers, this is sadly not the case. The speakers are tinny & rattle, and as far as volume goes, they can easily be outperformed by even the cheapest headphones.I guess my old dell spoiled me, after using this POS for a couple months, I have relegated it to glorified mp3-player status & have gone back to using my inspiron when I need to do real computer stuff... even though its more than 5 years old now and has half the performance specs, it can still run circles around this sad little HP.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "One of the best..", "Author": "Joe", "ReviewID": "R16DOGTR9L8J8I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This computer has been very reliable and has served without problems.

Right out of the box this computers performance was mediocre at best mainly due to the vast array of HP programs (gimmicks)that come pre-installed. After about three months of ownership this HP product really started showing its evil and ugly face. It all started with what appeared to be a problem with the video/graphics card and/or its drivers. If you try to play streaming videos from the web with the sound on it will simply crash....every time! After several calls to HP and dozens of attempts to troubleshoot and fix the problems using the HP support programs, I have come to the conclusion that this laptop is really just that bad. Another problem that I have encountered that absolutely blows my mind is its inability to connect to other HP brand products. My wifes father gave her a really nice HP printer for Christmas and it takes 30 minutes to connect to the printer every time you want to print something. This is a prime example of how poor HP products really are, my Cannon printer works every time. After months of being angry at this laptop my wife took it for herself and made me buy a new Dell brand laptop. I am counting the days that it takes for her to finally loose her mind and throw it in the garbage.

The old laptop would get very hot and fan would be blowing very high and then it would shutdown out of nowhere, I assume from overheating. I was lucky enough to find somebody to buy it from me and put that money towards this G72-B60US, and boy I'm glad I did. So far I have not had any issues with this laptop and I have had it for a little over a year. I use this computer as my 'main' computer and mostly for internet browsing, burning DVD's, and converting various video formats into DVD format. The conversion process is a pretty resource-heavy process and on my older laptop it would take anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour, or more. On this laptop it takes anywhere from 18-27 minutes depending on the length of the movie. All the movies I convert are full-length videos anywhere from one and a half hours up to three hours long. So the conversion process time has literally been cut in half, maybe even more. The screen size on this laptop is wonderful and the high-resolution screen is just beautiful. Bright, vivid colors, and very sharp images and video. I did notice the laptop becoming quite warm while performing the video conversions after a while so I bought a cooling pad (Cooler Master Notepal x2) here at amazon and it has made an AMAZING difference. The underside of the laptop is actually cool to the touch if you take it off of the pad, and I literally leave the laptop running for weeks at a time without ever turning it off (I leave it plugged in 90% of the time I use it.) Over the course of this year I have burned over 2,000 DVD's and so far have had no issues with the CD-ROM/DVD+-R. Luckily I have not had to deal with HP customer service and I hope I never have to. I agree with what other people say about HP and them being hard to deal with when it comes to customer service. My last HP laptop the CD-ROM/DVD-R ended up going bad and luckily I was still inside of the warranty window so I was able to get a replacement disc drive after they were not able to fix it over the phone. All-in-all I have nothing bad to say about this laptop in the 14 months I have been using it. I recommend running a good antivirus program alongside a good anti spyware/malware program and you will never have anything to worry about as far as infections or problems. I do not recommend using the antivirus that this laptop comes with.

The HP laptop has Windows Home Premium 7, a large 17\" display that produces great colors and detail in high resolution. It was easy to set up and has a full size key board with number pad, wireless N network card and plenty of memory and disk space.  The intel i3 processor was a pleasant surprise, providing much better performance than I expected.  This laptop is a great value for the money for everyday computing, I Highly recommended it.", "Date": "January 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not satisfied", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R3P1SNU9U5Y4HD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this one as a gift from my uncle. For a month or so I was happy with this. I was satisfied with the big screen and its visual clarity. There was an electrical problem which caused the system randomly shutdown and I had to lose some of my data. The system runs too hot while using and the power chord  has broken.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Just got this laptop today!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R28CU02CYUGSYF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow - what a deal!

I am amazed that a computer that cost me 500 has lasted me longer than laptops that have cost 1500. Granted, battery sucks, but I rarely use it off the charger, anyway. I upgraded to 8 gigs of ram and every 2 years I do a fresh install.

Spent several hours on phone w/ tech support before it was officially pronounced dead, now HP will NOT take it back for a refund. GRRRRR!!!  Aside from being a cheap piece of junk, it's designed very poorly - the mouse pad is the same textured plastic as the casing and will drive you crazy, the keyboard is spread out, yet there's no separation between the keys, which means big, clumsy keys that you have the spread your fingers over to use.I had a similar problem with an HP printer 3 years ago, should have learned!.
