{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Overall, a Very Good Buy", "Author": "R. Schultz", "ReviewID": "R2WZKS3AZ364R9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This laptop tends to be one of the least expensive ones available, but seems to have all the capacity of many much more expensive computers.It's main fault is its touch pad. The touch pad is not defined and so made for an unsatisfactory experience from the beginning. The control bar was also difficult to depress - left/right. It was very unresponsive. Then, about a week after I bought the unit, the touch pad failed altogether. I was unable to use it to move the cursor. I was glad I had taken the vendor's advice and bought a wireless mouse which I immediately switched over to using. I suggest you automatically get a separate mouse with this unit.This is a bit of an annoyance because the laptop only has three USB ports. With my printer in one and the add-on wireless mouse in another, I'm left with only one available port. But that's OK. You can always buy expansion ports if you have more devices you want to plug in.The standard KWERTY keyboard keys are themselves responsive though, and it's generally a pleasure to type and compose on this machine. My only criticism - the shift key and the \"enter\" key are juxtaposed so that it's easy to hit one when you want the other. The keyboard layout could have been designed a little better.This Hewlett-Packard comes with a fair amount of bundled software in it, including a very serviceable version of Microsoft Word. The vendor tried to convince me that I would need to buy an extra, up-dated version of Microsoft Word for this computer, but that is not the case. I was also told that no software published prior to 2000 would work on this computer. Well, some will. So before you go to the expense of buying any new software for this Windows 7 unit, I suggest you thoroughly explore what is already included with it and what you can run on it from your old collection. You might be pleasantly surprised to find most of your favorite old programs from Windows '98 through Windows XP WILL run on this laptop.The unit gets me onto the Internet speedily, without any need for upgrades to my equipment. It is also fairly quick and intuitive when it comes to setting it up and transferring files to. I was able to unpack it and get going with it on-line in less than an hour.So overall, this model laptop seems to be an excellent value.", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "An Awesome Laptop For The Price, But:", "Author": "Ghostly350z", "ReviewID": "R3FUPQQHQLM6TM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "PROS:-Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit runs flawlessly on the dual core processor.-Graphics card is excellent and watching YouTube/DVD videos on full screen is smoothe, even with high definition.-It's 3GB RAM is more than enough for normal use. The usage is usually in the 40% range with normal use, definitely a good thing.-Has a stylish cover to it. (mine is blue, I'm not sure if that's standard or not).CONS:-THE KEYBOARD LAYOUT IS HORRIBLE! I repeat, HORRIBLE. I type at an average rate of 70-80WPM and this is by far the worst keyboard layout.-Does not have a numeric keypad as on the side as most notebooks do.-The shortcut keys available on the keyboard aren't significant and really should not have been placed there to begin with (i.e., quick launch to calculator, email, internet, etc.)-Because of the keyboard, it's comfort rating is \"pathetic\" on my scale.OVERALL:Excellent choice, given the price and performance. The keyboard will take a LOT of getting used to, but eventually it won't be an issue. I'd highly recommend this product (G62-347NR).", "Date": "December 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "never by another HP computer period (freezes constantly)", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "RPV2W2G1C4IWA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this from Amazon under a clearance sale where it was apparently known that this PC was defective.

When it finally got to me I was so excited until I turned it on using my friend's charger, the display is cracked and bleeding through SO much that the computer is completely nonfunctional. I am more than disappointed since I've been emailing the seller and have only gotten two replies that still don't answer my question. I needed a computer within a certain time range considering the one my family was using stopped working and now all I have is another broken device.

If you look around at forums and such, you will find many issues with it being a low quality laptop. Ahead are just a few examples of customers complaining about freezing problems and crashing problems. Other customers complain about blue screens and mouse pad freezes. I have one myself, and I am extremely frustrated as this is my only computer to work with. Every minute or so, the computer will freeze for about 30 seconds and then come back. I have tried many things to fix it, all of them you may find in the following forum posts, but none have worked. Do NOT buy.Any hope for a g62-340us fix?
