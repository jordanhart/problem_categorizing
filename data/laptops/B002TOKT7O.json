I've waited until I really needed it for work, and needed to get one asap. After some searching, to really get the best deals, well, they're almost always online. I've found that for certain types of electronics, there is nothing wrong with refurbished. In fact, in many cases, the slightly older models are built with higher quality products, parts. And have fewer \"bells and whistles\" type features that can break easily. This Dell was / is surprisingly faster than I anticipated. It's not super heavy or bulky, it's great!! The built in speaker sound is loud enough that I can actually enjoy watching movies on it, or listening to music. The streaming is basically perfect! And the screen (the most important part for me) is large enough that I can sufficiently use this Laptop on the road for more complex software programs, for work.

We did run into an issue with the video card in it not being adequate for playing the games he wanted to play and consequently one game wouldn't work at all and the other runs very slowly. After researching the components in the unit, it appears there were parts from a variety of manufacturers which may also have contributed to the incompatibility of the laptop with the downloaded games.

I decided to go with refurbished since that meant it had been re built prior to me purchasing it and not directly from another user. Tampa Laptops had added a better wireless card, and expanded hard drive of 60 GB, and after looking at some new laptops in a store the other day for just under 500 bucks for 8 GB HD, i felt very fortunate mine was 60GB for 230 dollars. It has functioned fantastically other than the battery, which was the only thing in the description they couldnt garuantee and from what I hear is a common problem with the dell lattitude laptops anyways, tho it doesnt hold a charge very long it still does work, and Ive been using it for several months now, so still havent replaced the battery since I rarely use it for long without it being plugged in anyways. Its very snappy, with the decent wifi we have in the home anyways, and honestly ive seen newer lap and desk tops that run much slower HAHAHA.
