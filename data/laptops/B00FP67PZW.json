The layout of the keyboard works really well. It has all the standard ports that you would need: USB, HDMI...Lan. It's a pretty sleek and slim laptop which is why I like it. It's a great laptop for a home user or someone who just wants to browse the net every now and then.So here are my complaints about it: NO bluetooth on a laptop that should have this as a standard anymore. Battery life...sucks compared to others on the market today. Average battery time is about 3 hours. Most laptops are easily pulling 5-6 hours anymore. The hinges on the screen seem weak and like they'll wear out pretty quickly if you open and close it a lot. Also if you adjust the screen a lot for the touch part...I think that would wear them out faster.Other than that...not too many complaints. I think if HP were to fix these issues this would be a solid machine but it's a nice entry level computer into the touch market!", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$549.00", "Features": "15.6\" diagonal HD BrightView Touchscreen\n3rd generation Intel Core i3-3217U Processor\n6GB DDR3L SDRAM (2 DIMM)\n750GB 5400RPM hard drive with HP ProtectSmart Hard Drive Protection\nIntel HD graphics 4000", "Name": "HP Pavilion 15-n037cl 15.6\" Touch Laptop, Intel Core i3-3217U, 6GB Mem, 750GB HD", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41cwOPoNAyL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00FP67PZW"}}
