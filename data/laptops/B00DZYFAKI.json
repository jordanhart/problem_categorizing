Just google \"HP Envy wifi\" for the litany of ways in which people unlucky enough to buy one of these try to get it to work -- generally with no luck.", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome little laptop", "Author": "MR P RA", "ReviewID": "RBVLNZUHYYUL9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm very satisfied with this HP Envy. Even slimmer than an Apple Macbook and cost alot less. Very powerful laptop and indeed very nice to carry around. It can be a little noisy at times, when I run a few programs, perhaps they are heavy on the hardware inside. The fan often kicks off but it slows down really quickly as well. The good thing is it doesn't heat up like many other laptops. The material used and its design are very attractive. It's packed with good features like the HP Start Menu and the SIM slot for 4G internet. I really like this laptop. The only thing that kinda upset me is the hard disk rattle noise. I'm not sure if that's normal for a new laptop but it really shouldn't be. With the 1 year warranty, I'm sure I could send it to HP care but because I had to give to a brother overseas, I couldn't.", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great machine so far!", "Author": "Sherrie \"Sherrie\"", "ReviewID": "R1TRXQI2BPVZL2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Although I did not purchase off Amazon, but rather at Sam's club, I figured I would write a review. I purchased this computer back in August of 2013, and so far, it has not slowed down one bit. I use it everyday for law school, and it has been very reliable. My old HP was heavy and was getting a little slow, but nothing else was wrong with it - which is why I chose another HP. There is no CD drive in this computer, which helps make it a lot lighter and easier to carry around. I really like the 14 inch screen, because it is not too big, and not too small. My only complaint is that the bottom of the laptop is not level - almost like when a chair wobbles. Although it is not drastic or too annoying, it is a complaint. I looked at another one at Sam's about a month ago, and it was not level either. I'm not sure if it's just the ones at Sam's, or if it is this model. Again, it's not too distracting, so don't let that hold you back. I could send it in to get fixed, but I would rather take my chances and deal with it, because it do not want it to break in shipping, and I don't want to go through the hassle of not having my computer for several weeks.", "Date": "February 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice product!!
