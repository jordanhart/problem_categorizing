Runs fast and after 6 months of use no issues.  Fine for an everyday laptop.  Well designed and will do most anything you need out of a laptop.  Great size and light weight to throw in your suitcase for a short trip.  This is defiantly not for anyone into video games.  It does not have that type of speed or graphics.  This is just a good all a round laptop for everyday use and you can't beat the price.  I paid around $400 with shipping.", "Date": "May 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great entry level lpatop", "Author": "JLP", "ReviewID": "R21U1JZHQK62LA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are looking for a bargain in an entry level lap top then this HP is for you.
