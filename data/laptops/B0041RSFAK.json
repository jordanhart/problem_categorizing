{"Reviews": [{"Title": "An wonderful computer at any price that happens to be inexpensive.", "Author": "Duckman", "ReviewID": "R3LYGSV5JLELOH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought a version of this computer that has a few added videophile features such a Blu Ray player and Dolby 5.1 output.  No matter - with or without those goodies this is one excellent laptop.Two particular components stood out to me. The first is the screen which is vibrant and detailed like no other I have used. (I work coordinating a help desk for an IT department) It has a glossy surface like a pane of glass which adds tremendously to the appearance of depth in the images (but also makes placement critical to avoid reflections).  Absolutely superb.Second is the keyboard which is more like that of a desk computer than a laptop. The 16/9 video format screen allows for a correspondingly wide keyboard.  A unique construction provides a desktop type feel without the depth a desktop-type keyboard typically requires. (The laptop thus remain relatively light and thin.)Other features include 4 USB jacks, a monitor output, a network jack (along with a fine built in 802.11b/g/n wireless connection), Multi-Gesture Touchpad, 4 gigs of RAM, a Dual-Core Processor and Windows 7. Additional goodies include a built in web cam and mike.There are numerous small touches that show great care in design. Two examples: There is a small lighted switch next to the touch pad that turns it on and off. No more \"where did the curser jump to?\") Also the surface surrounding the keyboard is slightly textured in such a way as to both look great and be less prone to showing contact soiling.This is my 2nd Acer computer. The first, a small netbook, has been flawless during its 1st year of service. I have no reason to expect otherwise from this far more deluxe model.", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "One of the best value in 17 inch Dual Core laptop -- w/ caveats for 32 bit install", "Author": "Young \"GoRedSox\"", "ReviewID": "R60HTXF7NGQE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my father to replace his aging laptop.  Found a few issues but got through it.The major issue is that this is designed to be native 64 bit machine and little support for 32-bit.Overall one of the best value in 17 inch laptop around.  First Acer purchase, and happy with it.Ended up doing clean install of 32 bit Windows 7 to allow for some old printer drivers to workwith this machine (backed up and restored Windows 7 activation), and really happy with performance,power management, spec's, usability, display quality, etc.Positives---------- Solidly built, reasonably thin, and has all modern laptop  needs (WLAN, Ethernet, SD/Memory Card Reader, etc, but no  phone modem)- LED display: low power, very bright, clear and crisp screen.- Good performance, good spec (4 GB memory, 320 GB HD).Negatives---------- ACER DOES NOT support 32-bit version of Windows 7 on this machine!- Bloat of OEM and trial software (no different other vendor's,  e.g. Toshiba).  Not a huge negative if you are willing (and able)  to re-install Windows 7.Neutral-------- AMD/ATI chipset uses main memory for graphics, so at 64 bit  operation (original config), it's not noticeable, but if you  do 32-bit version install, then you lose significant amount  of usable memory, since 32-bit does not (cannot) access memory  beyond ~3 GB.Helpful Hints/Info for 32 bit Windows 7 Install------------------------------------------------ My father has devices (e.g. printers) that does not have 64-bit  driver.  True in many cases -- why should I toss/donate a  a perfectly good printer, just because the manufacter does not  have 64-bit (friendly) driver?  So I installed Windows 7 32 bit,  and did clean install.  Since Acer does not explicitly support  32 bit  drivers for this machine, here is what I did to get  proper 32-bit drivers for this laptop.  = WLAN driver - mine came with Atheros WLAN.  Included driver  worked for 32 bit.  This got me going on the network (included  Ethernet driver was only for 64 bit).  = Ethernet driver - go to K57 driver from Broadcom  = ATI/AMD graphics - download 4250 driver from ATI/AMD  = Launch Manager from Acer (MUST HAVE, for all the function  keys to work!)  = Also need to get audio (realtek HD), touchpad (ALPS), and  card reader (optional install -- Windows 7 recognized it)  from other Acer Aspire series (pick from a more recent laptop  by looking at dates)  = Built-in camera driver -- I used Camera_Suyin... driver, which  only gave me 640x480 but the original 64 bit driver allowed  1024x768.  Not a big deal for video chat but bothers me.  Continuing to search for better driver.- ACER recovery DVD disks (once you make them before you try all  this 32 bit install) does NOT allow you to do a clean install.  Only option is to install to factory original w/ 64 bit and  all the bloat software!  Search the web on \"Acer clean install\"  or similar to get guides on how to use normal windows 7 32-bit  or 64-bit install DVD to perform a clean install.  Some of the  guides also shows you how to back up Windows activation and  restore it (ONLY works on the original machine, so don't waste  time to anything questionable).  Search the web for \"Windows 7  activation backup and restore\" or similar key words.", "Date": "November 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "A very good laptop!", "Author": "Goldengate \"Goldengate\"", "ReviewID": "R15J3XGB2POYBB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this from Amazon on Black Friday for a little less than five hundred bucks.  I was attracted to the large screen, the decent amount of memory and the other reviews seemed fairly positive.  Having had it for a week now, I think it was a good purchase.  Here are my pro's and con's:Pro's:- Lightning fast computer.... faster than the HP desktop I purchased a couple of months ago.  Turn it on and you're at the desktop in no time.  Seems good at multi-tasking.- Great looking LED bright screen.... however as with other LED's, whites are a little more bluish than standard screens (I am looking at the screen now and comparing it to the laptop next to it)- Really nice keyboard - has a good \"feel\"- Less bloatware, etc than HP.  Very easy to set up in 10 mins or less.- Looks more expensive than it is.  The lower end models of HP and Toshiba scream \"I bought this for almost nothing at Wal Mart!\" but this has a nice streamlined look that rivals more expensive laptops.- Lots of USB slots (I count 3 plus one firewire)Con's:- No media card slots so you can't just take your SD card out of your camera and see the pictures on your computer.  You have to buy a separate reader.- No Caps lock or number lock lights - but the screen shows icons momentarily when either is activated- No volume control - must use Function key and then up or down arrow to adjust system volumeThis is a good system with good performance... pretty much \"no frills\" but the money is invested where it counts - on a good display, keyboard, and CPU.Hope this helps!", "Date": "December 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Gift for the wife", "Author": "J.

I love the screen size and the design of the laptop. It is not heavy at all and I like that the battery is not bulky and does not stick out from the bottom as did my old one. The design is such that it will not collect dust and fingerprints as badly as my old laptop which had a very shiny surface. Graphics are excellent. Everything works as promised in the specifications. It also has the feel of being on a desktop without feeling like you're chained to a desk. I like that there isn't a lot of excess software installed on the computer from the get go as well.
