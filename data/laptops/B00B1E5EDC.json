Shipping that fast in unheard of. I have been using it and I really don't see what problem everyone had with Windows 8. It's really easy to use. The laptop is very nice. Huge crystal clear screen, fast, quiet, and so many features I'm sure I'll never use them all. I will come back and share the device progress in a few months.", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Super Notebook", "Author": "DAUGHTER", "ReviewID": "R1KSV6N6ZBX07K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Finally....a notebook that meets my Visual requirements...HIGH KEYBOARD CONTRAST.The red body with white keys lets my eyes see the keys very easily.And....the BIG fan Laptop rest solves and Overheating issues.Use your head...that's what it's for.", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't buy", "Author": "Fellow Amazon Fan", "ReviewID": "RSWPEIEM8R5F8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It is a waste of core i5 or an insult to core i5 for Gateway to use the processor on their machines.  The motherboard is junk.  Can you believe for a third generation core i5 you get only a 4 on Windows index for its graphics?  And it claims to be high resolution of 1600X900?  The screen is of very poor quality and the resolution is not as good as low resolution screen on other brands.  In other words, 1600X900 sounds good, but does not look good, because you need a good quality screen to show 1600X900.  If the laptop is $300 for new or $200 for used, maybe people should buy it.  This is my first Gateway and it did not leave a good impression on me.  So I will never buy Gateway again.  Although it is perhaps the least expensive brand, in my opinion, it is not inexpensive enough for me to purchase any Gateway.  I would rather pay more for other brands.", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "hot, the product is the best", "Author": "gogu florin", "ReviewID": "R1ZDQMDH4H908U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First is cheap after that good. the configuration in pretty  and work very ok, the screen is enough to see your movies.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "3rd generation Intel Core i5-3210M 2.5GHz processor; Window 8\n17.3\" HD Widescreen Ultrabright\u2122 LED-backlit Display (1600 x 900); Intel HD Graphics 4000\n4GB of DDR3 memory; 500GB hard drive\nDVD Super Multi Dual Layer Burner;\n1.3MB Webcam; 2 USB 3.0; 1 USB 2.0; 1 HDMI", "Name": "Gateway NV76R24u 17.3\" Notebook PC - 3rd generation Intel Core i5-3210M 2.5GHz, 4GB DDR3, 500GB HDD, DVDRW, Windows 8 64-bit, Red", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31t9mIPraxL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00B1E5EDC"}}
