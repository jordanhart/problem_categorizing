When typing you really have to punch the keys to operate, space bar does work as long as you push it hard. The key board feels cheap.

It feels like is will break very fast.  No HDMI port as advertised.  If you're used to Toshiba laptops and know they are generally durable, this is not like that.  I can't believe Toshiba is selling such a shoddy product.  I've had 5-6, this will be the last.Tried to open/download the user manual direct from their tab and just errors, says manual located in a bad sector.  I wish I could send this back but live in Latin America and it would cost too much.

It's responsive, thinner than I expected and a bit lighter than my previous laptop. There is only one problem that I'm facing right now and it's that ever since I upgraded to WIndows 8.1 my webcam suddenly doesn't work at first I was assuming it might be the laptop's fault but now I think it might be because the driver software isn't compatible. I just hope it is sorted soon because I really love this laptop and would recommend it to anyone :]", "Date": "November 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wireless Dnt Work and It Freezes Consistantly", "Author": "Quienton Laing", "ReviewID": "R1KQWM0XDQGJYV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When i got this laptop and started to set it up it frooze like three times so i had to hold down the power button to complete the initial setup. After about a two weeks of freezing up the wireless stopped working. I figured the freezing up would work itself out so that didn't really bothered me.But now the wireless don't work so i figured it was my wireless router so i upgraded to a better router. To my surprise that wasn't the problem. I had a computer guy i know looked at it for me and he said that the wireless card in the pc in defective, it would just dissapear and reappear when it feels like. After contacting the seller he told me that they have a 30 day return policy so i would have to contact toshiba, Wow. I am not in the country so now ill have to pay shipping to send it to toshiba. So now i just have a laptop looking at me. I wouldn't recommend this laptop at all.
