I have had it for 3 months and have had issues with the loud fan noise as well as a rumbling soung in the fan. The computer has overheated and shut off. Took the computer back to the store I bought it and they tried to charge me to have it diagnosed under warranty. I bought an extended warranty on this laptop to prevent issuse like this. I have had problems with Sony products in the past and decided to give them another try. Big mistake. Sony product are poorly manufactured and fall apart within months. I would never buy another Sony product. Do not buy this laptop unless you are okay with wasting hundreds of dollars. I would buy anything else over Sony.

After about 6 months a fan started making loud noise. The fan remains silent for 10 seconds and starts making noise for 10 seconds or so after that. This silence-noise-silence-noise pattern keeps going till I turn my laptop off. After some googling, I realized it's a quite common problem to the CS product line.I am trying hard to calm it down and will update if I find a solution.Don't buy VGN CS-320 (maybe other VGN CS models as well)!", "Date": "April 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent laptop with only one annoying issue.", "Author": "Douglas E.

The only annoying issue is the fan management. This issue is easily \"googled\" where the fan runs almost continuously and at constantly varying speeds. Clearly a fan management software or firmware upgrade is needed but not available from what I can tell. Otherwise, this is an excellent laptop. The \"build quality\" is very good. If Sony had a fix for the fan I would have given five stars.", "Date": "September 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Tired of Loud Fan Noise!", "Author": "hasselaar \"belgie\"", "ReviewID": "R26ER9POYEWV2B", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have had this laptop for 1.5 years, it is not my first VAIO. I have had no problems whatsoever with my other Vaios, this model is a constant hassle. It makes incredibly loud fan noises, shuts down, or doesn't respond to keyboard commands while it is making the very loud noise. I brought this in to a specialist, they took it apart and could not find any reason for this fan noise. Naturally, while with the specialist, it did not make the noise.I thought that I would love this lap top, it was quite expensive at the time, but I thought that it would be worth it. After all- my other SONY VAIO laptops were great. Now, I find myself using the older VAIO, it is quiet and does not have the keyboard command issues.I am sure that other models of the VAIO are great, but do not buy this model.UPDATE-December 31st, 2010 - I read on the comments that SONY had finally admitted that the fans were defective and was willing to replace them. I called SONY, described the problem and they sent a Tech, person to my house to replace the fan. This all occurred within 1 week. The laptop works great now, no fan noise, no overheating, it is perfect. I certainly wish that SONY would have alerted all of us to this problem to begin with, it would have saved a lot of time. money and aggravation.", "Date": "December 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Expensive and Cool looking piece of SONY cr-p", "Author": "Bijouxrouge", "ReviewID": "R1MNM6H27850J3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought my Pink SONY Vaio Laptop in 2009. (Model Number VGN-CS320J). I bought SONY because I wanted to have something reliable that I could bring with my when traveling which was also capable of handling many applications at the same time.  (I gave my old Dell Platitude to my son.)I am disappointed on all counts.  Battery has never lasted more than 1 hr.  The Laptop heats up so much that it is too uncomfortable to hold on one's lap - even over a 4\" thick pad made to reduce heat transfer.  The fan has been noisy from the beginning.  Over time it has become even louder.  It almost sounds like someone blowing their nose.  (Don't even think about having a conversation with someone on Skype!)  I expect the fan will fail shortly.  The duo core does make it a little faster, but nothing spectacular.  The keyboard is great, but hardly a reason to buy this piece of SONY cr-p.", "Date": "September 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "IT IS A GREAT COMPUTER, Just fix the fan and its all good!", "Author": "whit10", "ReviewID": "R1AFL7Q2SO1103", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had the same problem with the fan as everybody else has that has written a negative review. All you have to do is call Sony and explain the problem, even if your laptop is out of warranty (mine was) they will still send someone to your house and replace the fan for you free of charge. Once the fan is replaced this laptop is a great product. It is quiet and runs smooth. Would have got a 5 star review if the fan didn't need to be replaced but since it has been replaced I could not be happier with it.My advice to anyone who is going to buy this laptop: Ask whoever it is you are buying it from if they have had the fan replaced and if not just be aware that there have been problems with them, but they can be fixed quickly, easily, and the best part is that you don't have to pay for it.

For years I bought into the hype that Sony produced good products.  Shame on me for blindly accepting Sony name brand products.  They are awful.  I am thick headed, in that I continued to give Sony the benefit of the doubt for years.  The desktop computer hard disc failed, 48 hours before I shipped out to the middle east for a deployment.  Hours on the telephone with tech support resulted in the requirement to ship the entire computer to Sony for repair.  This was the single computer in the home at that time, relied on for family communication by email while I was deployed.  Absolutely zero attention to this issue by Sony.I purchased a laptop before the desk top failure.  The first Vaio laptop was actually pretty goo - although very heavy to lug around.  It is still working - having been handed down to extended family.The second laptop ran hot right out of the box - the mother board failed in less than a week, requiring in patient repair by Sony support.  This took a week.  The computer continued to run unusually hot; bought a cooling pad to help with air flow.  When Windows 7 was released, I attempted to upgrade.  Upgrade was not possible, due to unavailable drivers for the video card.  Sony pointed to the video card maker, the card maker pointed back at Sony - neither company with any interest in solving the issue.  The consumer loses.  In retrospect, this was a good thing, as the mother board failed again at slightly less than 3 yrs of use.I purchased a Toshiba laptop as replacement.  Out of the box, powered up - it immediately found my home network, connected to the wireless printer, does not run hot, and has better speakers and produces video much more easily than any of the Sony computers.Sony equipment is junk.

It is loud! I have owned this laptop for about 4 months, and have not had any issues with it, nor did its previous owner. I'm going to call Sony today to see if I can have the fan replaced.

Overall, I feel quite comfortable in my purchase. Many others have reported an issue with the fan on this laptop. Although I have to agree that the fan does make some noises, I don't experience unreasonable volume of the fan or other operational issues. Since it is a laptop, and requires ventilation, I also use an external cooling pad while the laptop is on for several hours at a time and have never experienced over-heating or unwarranted shut downs. Anyone who uses a laptop for extended periods of time should look into purchasing one (they're relatively cheap, ranging about $10 to $30) and allow the laptop to breathe, especially when it's placed on soft surfaces like furniture, pillows, or your lap. Also, Sony has agreed to repair the fan relating to this model. Information for this can be found here: [...]. As with many technological devices, they all have their issues. I feel Sony products are very well made and they're support service programs are quite on top of any issues that arise. Additionally, they're customer service is very helpful as well.

I absolutely love how it looks and runs, but I agree with the other review that said the fan was a little loud.

As every other reviewer had pointed out, there was a problem with the fan (issue #1) noisy and defective. Also, (issue #2) the LCD started to blink in the bottom, first just a line, then a 1.5 cm wide band. We were lucky that it was another defective part in all the series, so Sony took the laptop for a month and a half and returned it with 2 new parts (LCD and cooler). Last, but not least, issue #3: the software is really annoying. A welcome manager gives a \"not working\" message, and the system says it's \"searching for solutions\" (never getting one), and Windows Vista is absolutely slow. The DualCore CPU means nothing.After we decided and reinstalled the whole system (with the factory restore utility) it remained slow and the welcome manager (now working) even when clicking on the \"don't open this automatically every time I turn my computer on\" option, keeps running during the start up!!?? and when you click on \"close\", it takes for ever to close down.Sony must have offered a free upgrade to Window 7 for this series, and include the Sony software and extra problems solutions in the upgrade, for sure.As long as the hardware is solid and not presenting new issues, formatting it and installing a Linux OS is the best deal for this laptop model.
