Windows 8.1 is not as good as Windows 7.Before you pay $ 1,700.00 for this laptop, be sure all the power is worth the money and weight.  If power is what you are after, this one is worth it.The 4TB of storage is more than adequate for many HD movies and a lot of music.  Although the drives are 5,400 rpm, the 24GB cache drive makes them perform like 7,200 when copying files.  Since it's big enough to hold Windows and all programs, it performs like a SSD when quickly booting or instantly returning from sleep.There were some complaints about the 17\" screen on this model.  The touch screen on my looks beautiful.  It's reflective rather than matte.  Reflective makes for better pictures/movies, while matte is less reflective in high light.  You just can't have it both ways.Time Warner just gave me a free super speed upgrade to 200 Mbps.  This laptop makes use of the entire 200 when connected with a cable, and I measured a mind boggling 167 Mbps with the 5 MHz WiFi.At 7 pounds, you won't want to take it on a plane.  It won't fit on the fold down tray anyway.  I have a much smaller laptop for plane trips.  But most of my travel is by car anyway, so it's easy to take.Once again, if you want power and can handle the size and weight, definitely consider this Beast.  If you want to take it on planes, or need to carry it around a lot, then look for something smaller.", "Date": "June 8, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00IJT4MQM"}}
