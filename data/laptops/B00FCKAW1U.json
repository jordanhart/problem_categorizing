{"Reviews": [{"Title": "light weight, good processor, a lot of storage", "Author": "Alex Alexzander", "ReviewID": "R1ZFW7ETGPB21D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Day 1Today I took delivery of the Acer TravelMate B. I bought this specifically because I read a blog post from a school which deployed these to their students with Ubuntu rather than Windows. They mentioned the light weight, good processing power and long battery life. I looked into the specific model used in the deployment, and it is this machine.I had to change a few settings in the BIOS for Linux to work, which was not hard at all. In fact I found several other BIOS features that I would like to have changed while there.I installed CentOS 6.5, which is a clone of RHEL 6.5. Once that was installed I started to add an additional repository and then started configuring all the apps I normally use.So far the machine is beating my slightly older Dell Studio XPS ultrabook. It's a tiny bit heavier, but the battery should last much longer. I actually prefer a hard drive over an SSD. The cost and high capacity is at an all time high. This drive has 500 GBs so it is fine for storing a lot of media if that's your thing. The dual core i3 runs 4 threads. 4 GBs of ram is small, but for Linux it is fine.The graphics are intel HD 4000 by the way. So I believe this is a 4th gen intel CPU. I have not tested the full time on the battery under Linux just yet. That should take a while. Hoping to get those 7 advertised hours. We'll see.", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00FCKAW1U"}}
