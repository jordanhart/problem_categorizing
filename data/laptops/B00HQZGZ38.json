The sound is good.Cons: It can't handle 1080 HD if your trying to watch YouTube but the graphics are meh, and the battery life isn't that good.Buy it if you REALLY can't afford a better PC otherwise Look for any other computer that has better specs than this.", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Notebook good, Win 8 sux!", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R1J1WEWTB7AP7V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've only had this a week or so.

The click doesn't respond every time, many times trying to left click will act as a right click, and the touchpad is just not as responsive as it should be.  Maybe this is just my particular unit...but it's very frustrating.Second, but most importantly, how do you get this thing to boot from a bootable CD/DVD or bootable USB Flash Drive, or from any device other than the Hard Drive that it comes with?  I have a pretty good background with computers but I have steered clear of Windows 8 because I am very much against Windows having any drastic changes, as it's been very similar with each version since Windows 95.  I got this system thinking that I'd be able to format the drive as with any previous computer I've gotten, and install Windows 7 using my Windows 7 DVD.  I've researched and found this whole thing about UEFI booting through the BIOS, and many forums say that all you need to do is change it to the \"legacy\" setting and switch a few other options, but the problem is the BIOS on this machine does not have a \"legacy\" option.  It is very hard for me to believe that newer and more modern technology would go in the direction of making it impossible to boot off of a CD/DVD or some other type of bootable media.  Does anyone have any answers as to how to make this laptop able to boot off of something else rather than Windows 8 on the Hard Drive that it comes with?  It doesn't make much sense to me.  Technicians and anyone that may have to do diagnostic work or fixing of the hard drive if it becomes corrupt or not bootable anymore cannot even do so with this being the case.  There has to be a way, I am just unable to find out what it is.  Please help if you know the answer.

I haven't downloaded or installed ANYTHING and it's already slow from the start, freezing often and having no other alternative but to shut it down by holding the power button down (which is probably destroying my laptop).  This is the nature of old laptops, not new ones.  The most annoying part is the wifi & internet.  I don't know if it is a glitch, but the connection dies every single time I use it, displaying \"Limited\" connection often when everyone else in the room is fine.  Seriously feels like a 56K Modem.  SLOW SLOW SLOW!The only thing I'm satisfied with is the physical look of laptop, pretty nice for $300.  But everything else, software and hardware is just terrible.  Like polishing a crappy car.  This laptop is only good if you absolutely need a budget laptop like i did (i was broke and my old laptop died).
