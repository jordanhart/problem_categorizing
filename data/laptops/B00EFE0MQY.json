{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not Bad At All", "Author": "Adjaero Pascal Ikechukwu", "ReviewID": "R35940XWCR5J69", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, this arrived on time and I must say that it's the best laptop for this price (got mine for $1,074 quite cheaper than you'll get from the official HP website). Am a gamer so I immediately loaded a few games into this machine and they all played really fine on high settings. Everything was okay apart from the keyboard, not that it's bad but I think it has a manufacturing problem were the top left seems kinda loose but this doesn't ruin anything.Everything works just fine, Windows 8 is just AWESOME (I don't know what people were complaining about, honestly), the wifi works well (I wouldn't say it's the best but it certainly is above average), the beats audio is also pretty cool and the speakers are really good. This laptop has a matte finish and the keyboard area is made of aluminium which gives it a premium feel; the rest of the body is made of some tough plastic. Aha!! the finger print sensor is AMAZING! this thing works. it saves time and I just love it, the touch pad is also good, I've had no issues with it so far.In summary, this laptop easily satisfies all my needs. Oh and the FHD display is BIG and MUAHH!!! 'BRILIANT'. Am happy I invested in this.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Trying to ride on a Mac Look?", "Author": "Georgianne McCaskill", "ReviewID": "R29I3OMGLEFKFN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am a Mac fan but can't afford one so being a former HP laptop owner I saw this lappie as a good value. Advantages are:1) I chose this 1080p screen for the resolution forgoing the touch option as I already have a touch screen Phone & tablet and recognize the advantages on those platforms. But for a laptop I prefer to have a full size keyboard. Geeeze just try to write on one of those formats for any length of time. I know there are those that have mastered the speed factor on a touch screen but I don't see the advantage on a laptop. Just give me a great looking screen I say and this screen way outperforms my previous laptop hands down (the touch screen is 720 vs this HD 1080). I realize that the touch factor is more of a software support issue (Windows 8) but I'm one of those not overly enamored by the direction Microsoft has taken with Windows.2). The keyboard layout has some nice improvements with controls for a Quick access to a \"How To\" window (F1 button) that pops up a window within Windows 8, Screen brightness up-down (F2~F3 buttons),  keyboard has a lit feature you can turn on or off (f5 button), Audio Controls (F6 Mute, F7~8 sound level down & up), Optical Drive Play/Pause Rewind & Fast Forward (F10, F9, F11 respectively) just to mention a few. Before the update to Windows 8.1, I discovered a keystroke to take me off the Tile page to the desktop by pressing the Windows button towards the left of the space bar with the letter \"D\" (for Desktop I presume). Since I came to Windows 8 from 7 I prefer the 7 GUI as many of you will. I'm not as hateful of the Tile Look as I first was but have more of the intuitive issues with Windows in general.3). The Mac Magic Mouse (for those of you who like it) didn't first work very well if at all with Windows 8, but somewhere along the line with updates and Windows 8.1 the Mac Magic Mouse now works nicely with this laptop.2). The fast i7 is certainly a plus alongside the power saving feature of this unique processor is a plus for the battery longevity compared to the other i7 choices. It saves over 21% ( 37 watts compared to 47 watts rating for the other options) translates to more battery surplus. The processor still takes advantage of all the known features of an i7 and you only lose 100mz in speed compared the equivalent and more power hungry i7's offered. This laptop is plenty fast & unless you're playing the numbers game between two laptops you won't notice much if any difference between processors. Compared to my older Dual Core2 , it's blazing fast. Also, it runs cooler than the other HP with a previous generation i7 we own. The fan on that one does constantly run hard while this one is usually much cooler & quieter since the fan hardly ever turns faster than an idle speed. I love innovation! But frankly you can really speed things up by getting a Solid State Drive as your primary drive and this will yield better results speed & value wise compared to going with a power hungrier faster i7 option. This is what I wanted to do when I decided on this laptop choosing to add a second drive when I could afford one. This brings me to some negatives as follows:Negatives:1) Imagine my surprise when I went to update the laptop with a second hardrive but couldn't because I found I had to spend more money on a Hardrive Install Kit ($30. & change+ $11 & change for shipping from HP~ about another $42... All for items that probably cost $2.50 to manufacture) that didn't come with the laptop. Really? Geeeze, just include the kit already!! These are one of the things that just grates on me about a manufacturer of a very expensive product... and, while I'm on my high horse,2) I have recently noticed the flex in the keyboard and is contrary to the intended look & feel of this Mac laptop looking wannabee HP. Mac's offer an alluminum looking sturdiness that HP and others have tried to copy and that's a plus but lacks in providing the function part by having a sturdy feeling keyboard. I'm sure that if you're delicate with the use of the keyboard & don't pound it ever (even if you want to from those frustrating Windows moments) you probably won't have any issues.3). This newer design offers less connectivity choices and is a reflection of industry practices. I have need for Firewire to support an investment in such periferals but HP no longer supports that format. Also, HP has cut corners and gone away from other busses & and ports previously available that could enhance your connectivity options and it comes only with USB3, an HDMI out, and an Ethernet, and headphone ports. Heck, why not offer at least one Thunderbolt port that is versatile. I'd easily forego one of the four USB3 ports for a Thunderbolt invented by Intel (that can provide video & Firewire support with adapters) and/or Firewire 800!4). Don't be too harsh about the Beats Audio. It's just a selling point and not really a feature. It is a laptop anyway, so what do you expect?5). I would prefer an easy way to turn the touchpad on & off as sometimes my fingers brush across it, highlighting and erasing some typing forcing me to more often than not have to retype text. I have to be on my game when I'm typing with correct posture being careful not to allow my thumbs to brush the very sensitive touchpad.Other than that, it's a lovely laptop. Life isnt perfect and neither is the thought process of those that design laptops like this. With a little refinement it could have been a GReat laptop. Still, I don't feel I should have to spend an additional $650 just to get Thunderbolt.", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very nice with 2 noteable drawbacks", "Author": "Cora V Mastren", "ReviewID": "R1UZPF6EV1EFSO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this from another site, but rating here as I look here for reviews, doesn't everybody?Anyway, the computer has some nice specs and overall seems very nice.  I've named her Buttercup.  There are 2 major drawbacks that drive me nuts:1)  The touchpad has no buttons.  It is one piece that you click on the bottom left and right corners to click.  I hate it.  It is horrible.  I want to take it apart and cut it so that it works properly.  I am a huge computer user, on them all day long.  I'm a software developer by trade.  Using the clicking feature of this touchpad is torturous.  Triple clicking things is near impossible.  I never realized how much I triple click things until I used this computer.  Horrible, horrible, horrible.  I hate having a separate mouse too as I'm usually on the couch and there is just nowhere to use it properly.  I will figure out a way around this.  If I have to take the thing apart and manufacture my own touchpad, I will, this is ludicrously mind boggling.  I am very agile normally with my fingers and clicking and scrolling and selecting and all of that with a beautiful grace that can only come from experience.  I cannot do anything gracefully with this touchpad.  It is an abomination and whoever designed it should be fired immediately.  Even just surfing the web and scrolling is a horrible experience.  I cannot fully express how much I hate this feature, so I'll just leave it at that.2)  Someone else mentioned the keyboard flexing.  It doesn't prevent me from typing or anything, but it sure does flex and is annoying to see how cheaply it is made.  I'm sure it is this way to cut down on some weight or something, but I would consider it unacceptable.All other aspects of this computer seem nice so far, I haven't done any tests or anything, but overall I'm fairly happy.  I just super hate hate hate hate hate HATE the touchpad and will be looking for a way to fix it, or replace it, or something.  So annoying!!", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great except Speakers and the Touchpad", "Author": "C. Marsellus \"CD Mars\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZQHM6R9BCGJ9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I love the computer probably because I desperately wanted a 17.3 inch which is hard to find now.  I must comment on how VERY difficult it is to navigate the right and left clicks with the one touch pad.  There's no separate button for them, just pushing on the bottom edge of the touch pad.  This was unbelievable to me at first.  Surely, a computer this fancy didn't make it more difficult to right and left click.  I called support and they didn't know what I was talking about.  (I guess the computer was so new, they weren't aware).  I wanted to know if there was a way to use keyboard to do these clicks because when I try to drag or highlight something, my thumb (on the bottom edge to \"left click) and my forefinger (on the middle) would get cramped with such awkward positioning.Why HP changed that I have no idea. STICK WITH WHAT WORKS if you can't make it better.Next, the speakers are awful.  I have to mute my TV and shush my dogs if I want to hear something from the computer (and that's with it on maximum sound.)  I had read a previous review that the sound system was awful, but I had no idea it was this bad.I'm going to keep the computer because I like the 17.3 inch screen.  Not many better choices out there.  I gave Samsung's a try, but I could only find the size refurbished, which was a mistake. Sent that back when the function keys didn't work.I usually trust HP's computers.  I have a cheap one from seven years ago that still performs greatly but it is a 15\" screen.  I would buy a better HP if they corrected these two problems.", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Screen door effect", "Author": "BlackEagle", "ReviewID": "R2EILSX2HGQ9OF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I like everything on this laptop except screen. It has what is called screen door effect. This means that you can see the pixels as there a tiny visible gap between them..in simple term you can see pixels grid specially on white.
