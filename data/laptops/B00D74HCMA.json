I'm surprised that I can see the mSSD in explorer window. The computer is not as fast as I expect out of a laptop with mSSD. Then I realize that the SSD cache is not turned on. To turn on the cache, you have to set the hard drive in raid mode. I went to bios and wow, there is no raid mode for hard drives! There are only ACHI and legacy modes. No RAID! No RAID? That essentially defeat the purpose of mSSD. Yet they have mSSD as an option which makes anyone reasonably expect Intel@ Rapid Response Technology to work with those computers. Now I have to return it to get one that if configured with mSSD, does use SSD cache for performance!How can anyone design a computer like this? It's ridiculously stupid. Lenovo not informing buyers that the computer cannot use mSSD to its purpose is like cheating and misrepresenting their product!I'm hugely disappointed at this model and Lenovo.Update:I laughed out loud when my review received attention from Lenovo people (see Corssix comments). I talked to four people at Lenovo regarding this issue. The most pleasant one is with the return specialist. He's a system administrator to my understanding. Even though he has no experiences in setting up mSSD cache--often called accelerating cache, he immediately understood the issue and admitted that it was a silly design by Lenovo and suggested that the higher levels should be alerted and potentially take actions. Too bad he's in charge of returns :). My call of this issue first went to their hardware technicians. I tried very hard to explain what accelerating cache was and would do. By the time the technician understood the concept, he admitted that he could do nothing and asked me to call back to their software support. I was about to simply return it and then decided to give their software support a try. A female received me and could not find my service ticket. Again, I was educating Lenovo technical support for a while and she admitted that she could do nothing to help me. She said, please call hardware support! I told her that I came from hardware support. She insisted that I did not contact the right person/department. I was transferred to hardware support. A different female received me and like the female in software support, she could not locate my service ticket either. I had to lecture Lenovo technician for a third time about the accelerating cache that my computer has and its roles and configuration in windows. She put me on hold several times, as if to digest my free education. For the last time I was on hold, at least 10 minutes passed and I could not wait any longer. I hung up and dialed the return department.Lenovo people either are not up to speed with the real tech world and are guenuinely ignorant about accelerating cache or they played dumb with me and other users. In either case, they are not tolerable and inexcusable. There are many tests done by experts on accelerating cache. Configured properly, accelerating cache almost match the performance of straight SSD systems. Understandably, the difference is in write operation of the disk. Such tests and reviews are widely available online. Even if the Lenovo \"expert\" is truly ignorant of Intel rapid storage technology, it is still inexcusable to speak before a Google search and some casual reading to get themselves educated. True, using the \"external\" SSD for temp files and swap files could speed up the computer and speed wise the Lenovo computer I received is not terribly bad either. However, when offered 24Gb of mSSD, I do expect accelerating cache level performance. The Lenovo I received is far off from that! \"External\" SSD? What do you mean by that? Lenovo's creativity went to wrong direction, it should be with the computer and technology and not with words!", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very fast laptop, poor build quality by Lenovo standard.", "Author": "Max Harry Johnson", "ReviewID": "R1ROC8D4TFYOLB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered the ideaPad Y410p Core i7 model directly from Lenovo. I have to voice my disappointment due to the decrease in build quality for this model from their previous.Previously I owned the ideaPad Y470p and Y480p, both of these had good build quality, they had metal lid and sturdy plastic for the overall body. The Y series were a good value for the money and in addition I felt like having a durable laptop that could last.This Y410p performs very well and equivalent to more expensive laptops by competing manufacturers like Dell or HP. The keyboard is quiet and very comfortable to type on, both the keyboard and touchpad felt very smooth. I ordered the 1600x900 resolution screen at it look pretty decent, though isn't IPS. It is a very fast laptop and quiet too.However, the Y410p have poor build quality by Lenovo standard and even at its price range to me. No longer is there a strong metal lid, but very thin and flimsy one. The plastic for the main chassis is cheaper too. When I hold the laptop and tried to twist it, with not much force, the entire chassis flexes, this is not a good sign, and does not happen with the older Y480 model.I still think it's a very good laptop and probably perform very well as a desktop replacement, but it won't hold up to beating and lots of portable use over the long run unless you take good care of it.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Powerful and cheap but with some catches", "Author": "Moose", "ReviewID": "RM0J9TU1HHZ5M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted to try some mid-level gaming and that is why I chose the Y410p. Considering the specs and the features you get for the price, this machine is in a class all by itself. Similar builds at HP and Dell can easily run for $200-$300 more. I actually had to send my first model back and this is why: When i got my first model, the first thing I did was downgrade to Windows 7 because i had read bad things about Windows 8 and didn't like the new interface. Windows 7 actually ran pretty great but there were a few bugs and some problems with the drivers. I could tell that this machine was built to run with Windows 8. I contacted Lenovo Support, who were very helpful. I told them that my laptop wasn't working properly and I wanted a new one. They sent out a new one the next business day and I was able to keep using the one I had until the new one arrived. With the new model, I stuck with Windows 8 and it's been pretty good. I found a way to disable the new UI and stick with the classic Desktop mode.This laptop actually does a great job with gaming, I play Battlefield 3 and Medal of Honor on high settings and you can max out the settings on most games. Backlit keyboard is very nice as well. The only complaints i have deal with the keyboard and touchpad. Simply put, the touchpad is terrible. It is designed like the apple macbook touchpad but is not anywhere near as responsive or effective. It's just something u have to get used to. Also, some of the keyboard keys such as Enter, Backspace and Shift are smaller than standard size and this also takes getting used to. I've had this laptop for 3 weeks and still mess up sometimes.Overall its a really good laptop but it has some minor design flaws.UPDATE:OK, so it's been about 2 months now since I've had the laptop and I'm sticking with what I said. Besides the minor annoyances of the touchpad and keyboard, everything is great. Another thing i forgot to mention that the laptop is great cooling wise. I always have my laptop sitting on a fan but I don't even turn the fan on anymore, the laptop does a great job of keeping cool. Only when I'm gaming do I even notice any hot air and even then, the built in fan in the laptop pushes it all out from the left side of the laptop.UPDATE #2:My laptop crashed and I had to reset it to factory settings. I called tech support and they were super helpful, plus it was SUPER EASY to fix the laptop. They have a feature built into the laptop with a button the side that you can press and it will reset the laptop to factory settings really quickly. You lose all the files and data that you have saved but it gives you a fresh laptop.

First thing I noticed was the laptop does have a interesting display.. I can't say I like it much, but its \"alright\". The cpu is much faster than I anticipated and the graphic card did really well under the games I tested. The speakers on this are great though, extremely loud and much more than I asked for.During league of legends it got a stable 60 fps on medium settings. Problems with this laptop are the wireless. Definitely something you should look into before purchasing this laptop. Either you buy an external usb adapter, or you purchase a new wireless chip, and you need to open the back end, remove the old one and put the new one in. Make sure, you find a video or clear instructions on what to do. There are \"whitelist\" that Lenovo has blocked out. Another thing you might you want to look to is purchase an SSD. The hdd that comes with this is nothing really to brag about. Yes, its expensive, but its well worth it. The appearance for the laptop almost looks carbon fiber, and its really nice. The keyboard nice, and they do make a pretty audible noise when clicked on.

It is powerful and has a lot of features in a budget, but the laptop itself falls short of my expectation. First the edges are razor sharp! I cut my fingers, seriously not kidding when I ran my fingers around the edges of the laptop. The base of the laptop is poorly designed with a ridge that is sharp and hurts ur palm and wrist area because it is so sharp. The key board is very disappointing, no dedicated mute and volume buttons and any other enhanced features for easy access. The mouse pad does not even have a raised left and right click and terribly sensitive and fussy. not too crazy about the red-lit key board, and the shape and size of the keys, keep hitting the enter key when I mean to hit the back key! The machine gets really HOT, and my hands try to avoid that side of the laptop...not too crazy about the battery life either. overall, if I had to do this again, I probably go for a Sony with less features, the key board will be nice and wont have such ruff edges.One more irritating thins is the power cord.

I am writing this review to describe my customer service experience with Lenovo directly.  They get two stars (instead of one) because they did do the right thing with the replacement model, more below.  I ordered a y510p on 11/13 and cancelled it also on 11/13, to order a better laptop from Lenovo: the y410p model #59369916.  Despite cancelling the original order (on the same day) and re-ordering the new one, they still shipped the cancelled order on the 11/18.  On 11/18, I called and cancelled the order -again- AND had the laptop rerouted back to their warehouse.  They had already billed my credit card for the cancelled order and they would not credit my account till they received it back, despite their being nothing I could do nor the fact i didn't have the laptop.  On 11/22, it was still in transit (to me) so I called again.  Same story, they will reroute and do credit when the laptop returns to their warehouse, even though they will not do the reroute...  11/25: First attempted delivery to my house: reroute still not done, credit still not done and the second machine I ordered (the y410p) was discontinued 12 days after I placed the order.  Now I have no laptop and an $800 bill on my credit card that they will still not credit despite numerous calls and even involving my credit card company on the phone with their supervisors.Purchase At Your Own Risk from Lenovo.The customer service people are decent and sympathetic, however, they have no ability to do ANYTHING.  To elaborate on the 2 stars vs one, I was promised another laptop at my original price mind you, that has even better specs than this - I am not holding my breath.  At the time of this writing my replacement order was rejected by Lenovo's credit department due to a technical issue despite the fact that they have already posted 2, YES TWO orders to my credit card...I figure, since I am currently still on the hook for $800 for the original order, I may as well play this out to see if I can get the new laptop.Purchase a Lenovo machine at your own risk and
