Paltry display quality, heavy.", "Author": "Poppin \"Poppin\"", "ReviewID": "R1JOXHEN9AI7JJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If you can get this for an awesome price then do it.  I got this from the MS store on a black friday deal and it doesn't come w/ bloatware.  I was actually going to return it right away because the screen didn't look good.  It was washed out like the old laptops w/ LCD backlit screens.  This is actually and LED backlit screen.  I'm used to Dell Ultrasharp displays and high pixel density screens but I got used to it over time.This laptop is fast but the battery is only a 4cell.  I haven't tried real world battery tests since I always plug it in but they claim 4 hours so I'm assuming 2.5hrs real world using wireless.  This NV570P10u doesn't come w/ an optical drive but there is a spacer/blank plastic insert in it's place.  You can add your own slim 9.5mm optical drive.  The larger 12.7mm optical drives won't fit in there.  The hard-drive is a Seagate Momentus Thin 5400.9 500 GB 5400 RPM SATA 3Gb/s 16 MB Cache 2.5-Inch Internal Notebook Hard Drive (ST500LT012). RAM is Kingston Value RAM 4GB 1333MHz PC3-10600 DDR3 Non-ECC CL9 SODIMM SR X8 Notebook Memory (KVR13S9S8/4) occupying 1 of 2 slots so I can upgrade if need be.  Recovery software requires 16GB USB drive (not included) to copy the recovery partition in case your hard-drive dies.  Please do this immediately.  It comes w/ a 1 year warranty from Gateway.  I'm planning to buy an SSD and get a 9.5mm HD cd-rom caddy and put the 500GB hard-drive in the optical bay.  It's fast now but I know it'll slow down as the hard-drive gets filled up and fragmented.Pros:1. Core i5-3337u is fast and efficient2. 10 point touch screen is responsive3. Touch pad is responsive4. Full size keyboard w/ number padCons:1. Washed out display2. Heavy, almost 6lbs w/ out an optical drive3. Poor battery life4. old style (non-chicklet) keyboardThis isn't my main computer. It's only good if you get it for a really good price. I don't think it should be a main computer but if you are looking for one for your kids or undiscerning senior citizen then it's a good choice.  I usually want to see the display by \"showrooming\" before buying laptops but I couldn't with this one since it is new to the market and I had to act quickly for the sale.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best laptop for this price", "Author": "jason", "ReviewID": "R1M88QV300AA7Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "You will need to pay at least 500+ USD for a HP/DELL with exactly same configuration.

First the touch screen did not work right out of the box, not until I updated to Windows 8.1 did it start to work. Odd that it passed Gateway's quality control with the touch not working. I updated to the latest Adobe Flash and the touch screen went out again. I removed the Adobe update and the touch screen worked again. Next, the laptop does not come with an internal DVD/CD drive. I searched everywhere for one but to no avail. I contacted Gateway customer service for a part number and they could not give me one. I asked for a similar model of the same series and they said, sorry that would void the warranty. They told me to get an external drive, which I did, but sure would like to have an internal drive. The positives are, it is pretty fast and the screens resolution is just fine as well as the screen size is great.Update: After having this laptop for 4-months, I upgraded my ratings to 5 stars.

I was a little turned off by the reviews I read about the laptop, but as soon as I got it I realized those reviews were without merit. Firstly, this laptop is fast, and the 3rd gen i5 processor in it can darn near match the 4th gen i7 in performance. The touchscreen works the best of any touchscreen computer I have ever used, even beating high-end touchscreens like the lenovo yoga. I have found a lot of people complaining about the weight, and although I don't know the exact weight, it is definitely lighter or as light as any 15 inch laptop out there, including the lightweight sony vaio. I have also noticed how much better gateway support is over hp, lenovo, sony and asus. My only complainy about the laptop is that the keyboard is not back-lit. And for the record, I did upgrade from 4gb of ram to 8gb ram after I got it, though 4gb of ram is still a good amount for most day-to-day computing operations.All in all, I have to say that this laptop, which I purchased for $435.00 is equal to in performance and quality to any $1,200.00 laptop I have found, and I would have to say it is the best laptop I have ever owned, again besting a $1,300 sony vaio.", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "nothing but problems", "Author": "MB95", "ReviewID": "R3JLIDSW0C4K30", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've had it for less than a month and had nothing but problems.
