{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Lenovo u300s versus Asus UX31E...The Winner is...", "Author": "Buckhippo \"Buck\"", "ReviewID": "R69MG4EDRVDE2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have waited to get my hands on an ultrabook since Intel basically threw the challenge at PC manufacturers to build something high end that could actually approach the standards that have made Apple so popular. Let's face it, these ultrabooks are in response to the wildly popular Air series by Apple. Companies like Lenovo, Asus, Acer, HP, Sony, have stepped up to the plate and took a swing at it.After having owned an Acer, Asus, Mac, and now Lenovo's ultrabook, I can safely say that in the Windows family of computers, the Lenovo u300s is by FAR the winner over the others. Here is why:1. WiFi - Asus UX31e has a serious problem with its internal wifi adapter. Out of the box, two of the UX31e had serious problems with wifi. I updated the bios, flashed it, you can read about the entire review on the Asus ux31e customer review by me. None of the issues I have had with wifi have occurred with the u300s. In fact, the Lenovo is blazingly fast.2. The Touchpad - Lenovo got it right by using the much better Synaptics pad than Asus who went with an inferior product and it shows. The touchpad on the Asus has required them to release software updates and it still doesn't have the fluidity that this Lenovo has. The pad feels much more rich and the smoothness is on par with perhaps the best experience I have had using a touchpad on a laptop. Even the multi touch features similar to the MacAir are done the best on the Lenovo u300s.3. Keyboard - The Lenovo just feels solid. The keys are brisk and responsive and you actually love typing on it. It makes typing fun if that's even possible. The Asus has shallow keys and I don't mind the Asus keyboard at all but the one on the Lenovo just feels like its a much better quality. The biggest factor on the keys, and its a big one for me, is that function keys are natively computer functions. Meaning, if you want to raise the volume using keys, you don't have to hold the FN key down and then the corresponding action key. So, when I want to raise volume, I just hit what would be F3. This makes a lot of sense because you are much more likely to do things like raise lower volume, adjust screen brightness, mute it with one key strike, etc than use actual function keys. I love this. On the Asus if you wanted to raise the volume, you have to hold down the function key on the left side and hit the raise volume key on the right side. Trying to do this with one hand cause you to stretch that hand nearly all the way from tip of thumb to tip of pinky if you want to reach this functionality. I play music on my laptop and key functionality is a big deal to me.4. Speakers - The Asus does seem to have better speakers. Side by side, the quality of the UX31e speakers seems more full with deeper bass tones. The Lenovo is not bad though and I am very happy with the quality of the speaker on the u300s.5. Performance - both for their own specs seem fine. It's an ultrabook so don't think you're going to be doing much video editing on it. However, for internet, word processing, email, and multi-tasking both are fine.6. Heat - I couldn't use the Asus on my lap after about 15 minutes because the back portion of the laptop gets very hot. I've currently had the lenovo on my lap for the last 30 minutes and its warm but not hot at all. I wouldn't worry about having the Lenovo resting on my lap while I type, even in shorts.7. Webcam - both seemed fine. I tested it out and it may just be me, but google chat seemed more clear with the u300s than the Asus. This could be related to the Asus's poor wifi signal?8. Screen - both are nice to look at. Viewing angles are about the same. No complaints on either one for the screen although when looking closely at them, I dare say that the contrast seems better on the Lenovo. The Asus does have a higher resolution so for those who need that for photos, Asus may be better here.9. Ergomomics - by this I mean typing, using the mouse pad, etc. The edge of the u300s is sharp and if your wrists rests on it for too long, I can see how this could get uncomfortable. I've been typing on it for an hour now, doing emails, etc and I have no problems with it but think others might. The Asus doesn't have this issues because of the tapered nature of it.10. Portability and Ports - I wish the Lenovo had a SD card slot. Alas, it doesn't. The Asus however does. So if you're doing a lot with SD cards, you'll need an adapter for it on the u300s. Both are highly portable. The power supply on the Lenovo is thinner than the Asus and doesn't feel cheap, whereas the Asus feels like it could break if you dropped it.11. Other Considerations - There isn't much bloatware with either. However, you have to spend A LOT more time fine tuning the Asus to fit your style than the Lenovo. The Lenovo in other words just seems to feel more natural right out the box and that's what you should expect in this price range.12. Winner - Lenovo U300s hands down. After going through so many of the first generation ultrabooks from Asus, Acer, and now Lenovo, the U300s is by far the superior machine. Let's put it this way: The Lenovo is an elegant minimalistic design that just feels and screams sophistication and reliability. It's stylish without being so flashy like the Asus. While the Asus gets a lot of \"ooooo aahhhh\" looks, the U300s is more subtle, like that very beautiful lady in a room that is genuinely stunning because she is confident without being flashy. The Asus on the other hand is like the girl with a lot of flash, trying to get the most attention, but for me was too flaky (just making an analogy, I don't mean any disrespect to any females!).Feel free to comment. I hope this has helped you all in deciding. If you're going to get an ultrabook, go for the Lenovo U300s. I ended up returning my Asus UX31E and Acer Inspire because they just are not in the same category as the U300s. After you experience the Lenovo u300s, you don't even want to type on anything else. Honestly. As a gift, I can tell you the Lenovo would be amazing for anyone who gets it. They will love it.Congrats to Lenovo. If you continue to make quality high end products like this, you will lead in the PC World.Happy Shopping everyone!***UPDATE 11/04/11***Here is a link to another review (with benchmarks) in the Lenovo U300s vs Asus UX31E debate:[check in comments; amazon apparently didn't want the link post here but it is in the comments]Hope this helps everyone pick the ultrabook that's right for them. The U300s just happens to be right for me. Good luck!***UPDATE 11/09/11***Asus has acknowledged the problem and posted this on Amazon in response to the customer reviews of the ASUS UX31E (search for UX31E on Amazon.com and read the customer reviews to see this there):\"Please check your Device Manager and verify if the touchpad is Sentelic or Elantech. If it is Elantech, it will show that it is Elantech. If it is Sentelic, it won't show the name but rather will just say General or something along those lines. The latest drivers fix the issues a lot of you are having and you can download the latest drivers from [..link in amazon review of ASUS UX31E...]. When you select the TouchPad download category you will see the latest update for Sentelic and for Elantech.To fix the wireless issue some of you are experiencing, please download the latest WLAN driver from [...link in Amazon review of ASUS UX31E...].Best Regards,ASUS Notebook Support\"So there you have it. They have acknowledged that the UX31E has issues unfortunately. It's a beautiful ultrabook. Maybe their 2nd generation of the UX31E will get it right.Also, why have two different providers for their touchpad??? I don't see the logic in this because it confuses customers when they need to update the drivers and they have to go digging through their device manager. This is why Apple understands what customers truly want: a computer that's consistent and easy to use and upgrade. The Lenovo U300s in my opinion is the closest thing to Apple quality for a Windows ultrabook. I sincerely hope Asus listens to what the customers are saying, especially with their wallets.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lenovo U300s Review...not perfect, but almost perfect for me.", "Author": "Fernandez", "ReviewID": "R2HB9PM30A3IVB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First review ever, but the U300s is worthy of a try.Just for some background, this is my personal laptop purchase.  I'm a gadget junkie, but on a budget and look for value. I don't mind paying a little more if it's worth it.  I'm an engineer by profession and was looking for something versatile to be able to use for personal but also powerful enough for work.  I'm also a Windows person who for many years sat idly by while Apple fans have gotten the best hardware.  My alternative prior to an Ultrabook was going for a dual boot of the Macbook Pro 13\" to use Windows on it.Been wanting a new notebook for a while, so thought long and hard.  Looked hard for any piece of information I could grab on Ultrabooks.  Waited as long as I could for reviews too.  Unfortunately, I was struck early by the unique looks of the U300s.  Poor reviews of the Acer, and mixed reviews on the Asus UX31 also helped to affirm my decision.I purchased the Core i5/128GB version of the Lenovo Ideapad U300s from Amazon via ABT Electronics.  I actually cancelled a CompUSA order because the ABT price was so much better plus NO TAX!! Shipping was fast.  Delivered in about 3 days.Here's a quick review, it's not a technical review.  Just a mix of likes/dislikes addressing some of my main concerns:1) Overall, very good build quality.  I'd say 8.5/10, as there is some creaking on the palm rests.  I really have to try to make it creak, but creak nonetheless.  Otherwise, very good tolerances, everything is tight and sharp.  Great balance.  Lid opens with one hand (UX31 doesn't even do that all the way).2) I love my Apple desktop keyboard with the number pad, but I really like Lenovo's keyboard.  I've used the Thinkpad keyboards for a while, and really like those too.  The island keys on the Ideapad are good.  If I had to rate them:- Apple keyboard = 9.5- Thinkpad notebook = 8.5- U300s Ideapad = 8.0Trackpad does sometimes get in the way, as it is close to the keyboard.  I'm using F6 to turn it off for right now.It's not backlit, but I've never had a backlit keyboard, so it wasn't a deal killer.3) LOVE the ventless bottom.  I use the laptop in bed, and the ventless bottom was a key selling point.  Machine never gets hot.  I haven't even gotten it too warm.  Fan does go on constantly, but it's hardly noticeable.  Feel comfortable using or leaving on a bed.4) Unit's main body color was darker than I expected.  I have the \"graphite grey\" version.  The marketing pictures makes it look more silverish (like the MBA) but it's darker.  The lid and bottom are also more of a \"greyish brown\" color.  I like the colors, but not my favorite, and also not exactly what I expected.  Ironically, it's more in line with and matches the colors of my Nexus One phone.One issue is though metal, the lid and bottom seem to absorb oils from the hand.  No finger prints, but oil.  You can wipe off, but still annoying.5) 128GB SSD is fast.  No benchmarks, but feels snappy.  Cold boot is ~15-20 seconds.  Wake from sleep is as little as 2 seconds and up to 6 seconds!  There have been times where like the MBA, you open the lid (one handed) and it's there on the sign-on screen.  Love that.Yes, it's only 128 GB, but I have broken it out into 2 main partitions, one for the system and the other for programs install and storage.  There are other smaller partitions, including I think the recovery partition.  I'm not messing with those.  Using Spotify for my main music source.  I have all of my photos and pictures downloaded which is about 25GB.  I still have ~30GB to play with on the storage partition.I also have a 750GB USB 3.0/7200 RPM Hitachi Touron Pro external HDD for portable storage.  So between the two, I have plenty and fast storage.6) Screen is 1366x768, which is okay for me.  Over the years, my eyes have gotten worse, so I actually appreciate that it's not too high resolution.  I can attach to my 24\" monitor directly via HDMI port.  This was not a deal killer.7) My main gripe is no SD card slot.  Silly oversight on Lenovo's part.  Not a dealbreaker, as I have a USB card adapter.  Not a photographer or anything, but still...so small, Lenovo could have put one in.  It was a big gripe in reviews of their U260 model from earlier in the year.I saw the Asus UX31 at Best Buy today in person on display, and had I seen it before I purchased the Lenovo, I would have considered it more seriously.  Probably a better machine, great build quality (no creaking), great sound.  Keyboard was okay too.Overall though, a happy camper with the Lenovo.  The U300s has it's flaws (no SD card, and honestly wish it was a little lighter colored), but almost perfect for me.  Love that it's a Windows machine and looks more akin to a Macbook Pro than an Air, which I appreciate, but < 3 pounds.I plan to keep this little guy for a while.There are very good professional reviews out there which you should check out.  Here's a list compiled by Ultrabooknews.com- [...]- personally, I've read the Mobile Tech Review, Engadget's and The Verge's reviews.Happy hunting.", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wish it was built better", "Author": "SDNY", "ReviewID": "RO2ZCBTMJGU7P", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is a belated review. I was really looking forward to the U300s and got one on amazon as soon as it was available.I really really liked this laptop, but one day after lifting up the screen, I found the display no longer worked. There were strips running along the screen that were now whited out. After looking this problem up and talking to customer support I found that several other people had this same issue due to the fragility of the screen. It basically has to be lifted only in the center and if you lift off center you risk bending the screen enough to break it, even if not that much force is applied.I'll give some of my general impressions as well. The laptop has a great professional look with a thin profile. The screen was bright enough for me but in the sunlight the gloss made it difficult to see. The keyboard was sturdy without much flex although it didn't feel as solid as the old thinkpad keyboards. And this computer is fast. I got the I5 and was quite happy with the startup time and processing speed.In the end I had to return this laptop, and while it has a ton of things going for it, to have a screen that can break that easily is a disappointment. I think being a 1st gen ultrabook it wasn't ready for primetime.", "Date": "July 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great laptop if it weren't for the trackpad", "Author": "JR", "ReviewID": "R2A6QCQVTHRDNQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "UPDATE 3/17/14: The trackpad stopped working within months of purchasing the laptop. After 1.5 yrs the trackpad is getting repaired for the 4th time (going on 2 weeks at the repair center currently), and since the extended warranty is now expired those repairs are no longer covered. I paid over $1400 for a defective computer. Despite this, Lenovo refuses to negotiate a discounted post-warranty or anything else for the trouble I've had with their product from the beginning.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I'm a student. I use my laptop on a daily basis, mostly for watching video recorded lectures online and accessing PowerPoint, Word, and pdf files. Tried to write a review on Lenovo's website, but they screened it out.Likes:look & designsuper quietdoesn't overheatfast startupgreat keyboardpretty long battery life though decreasing over the year I've had it (that's what batteries do)Dislikes:speakers sound tinny, volume unimpressivetrackpad erratic despite adjusting sensitivitytrackpad stopped working after 5 monthseven after replacement the trackpad still freezes--invariably so when computer is coldno SD port (c'mon, Lenovo. for this pricetag??)the keyboard scratched the screen (I recommend placing a cloth over the keyboard before closing it)Lenovo Tech Support*Bottom line: I like this laptop and could never go back to one that isn't equipped with a solid state drive, but like any computer it's not w/o problems. Except for the trackpad issue they're problems I can live with. An external mouse helped me deal somewhat.*The very first U300s I purchased was defective. I think the fan was hitting the keyboard--sounded like an electric razor in the left corner near the esc key. Lenovo Tech Support infuriated me when the rep told me it was a \"customer perception issue\" and that was how the laptop was supposed to sound. Ended up calling Lenovo Customer Service and exchanging it for the same model--sure enough, second one was just fine. No buzzing.Trackpad issues were there with both laptops. The mouse spontaneously freezes--only way to fix is to close the lid and open it again (variable success) or use external mouse (always successful). UPDATE 4/17/13 - Trackpad is freezing more frequently. It will have to be sent in for the 3rd time, all three repairs being due to trackpad issues. Upside is they usually fix it and have it back to me within a week. Downside is the problem persists. Glad I got an extended warranty, but it's really annoying that it never seems to be a long-term fix.", "Date": "April 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worst computer i have ever owned", "Author": "myAmazon", "ReviewID": "R33PQIV8KFGUSV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had nothing but troubles with this computer.  the hardware is faulty.
