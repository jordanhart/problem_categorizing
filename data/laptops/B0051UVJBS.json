{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Amazingly Beautiful - but not suited for regular portability", "Author": "Don Alan Uhrig", "ReviewID": "R25GPQ4CR36VMZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this massive screened beauty for 4-months now with not a single glitch! I replaced a 15\" Dell XPS, and this larger screen size is very welcomed. Here are some observations:1. Sheer size. This laptop is in the category of DTR (desk top replacement). In other words, this machine is large enough to feel like an acceptable replacement to a full blown desktop system. The beauty of a DTR is how much cleaner your desk will look with the laptop open or closed.2. The screen is bright and beautiful. The glass covers nearly the entire lid and there is a 1/2\" black framing under the glass on the sides and bottom. The framing is slightly larger on the top where the web-cam resides.3. The lid operates solidly. It does not have a wobbly feel. The hinge is tight enough that when you open the laptop, you have to hold down the lower half of the machine - as if you are prying the two halves apart.4. The keyboard is full size and includes a ten-key number pad. The keys are what is called 'chicklett' style. The keys operate properly but I am still not used to the unique arrangement of some of the key. Especially annoying are the dedicated half-size directional arrow keys. I could turn off the NumLock and use those arrows, but I use numbers a lot. The back-lit keyboard is a first for me, and I like it a lot!5. This machine does play (but not burn) BluRay. (Honestly, blank BD disks are still expensive. An external USB drive is a better method of data storage.) Also plays and burns DVD & CD. This optical drive is a tray loader. I prefer slot loading only because when I have the tray extended I always feel like I could accidentally break it.6. The sound system is incredible! Six speakers including a sub-woofer. When watching a movie on this computer I'm about 3-feet from the screen, and the picture quality and great sound are in competition with my large screen HDTV and THX sound system. It's that good.7. Of the 5 USB ports, one is USB 3.0 which allows my primary backup drive to do it's job in a fraction of the time compared to USB 2.0.8. Because of the sheer size, I will not be hauling this around on a regular basis. I have a netbook that I carry to school. But I did want to have a case for this machine for those rare occasions. Again, because it's to big, finding a case took hours of searching! Here is the model I found that I purchased. Cut and paste this into Amazon's search bar: Everki Advance Laptop Bag - Briefcase, Fits up to 18.4-Inch (EKB407NCH18). (I wrote a review on that case - love it.)9. The machine connects rapidly to wi-fi. There is an easy access dedicated button on the front left edge of the device that instantly brings up the wi-fi and bluetooth toggles.10. The bottom line for me when selecting this machine was company reputation and price. The laptop has perfectly handled all the heavy processing digital media editing and processing software that I have installed. Not a single burp in four months.I would feel comfortable recommending this machine to any friend or relative seeking a DTR. In the realm of 18\"+ screens, the market is still narrow. You could go with another manufacturer and pay more. Just compare the specifications and make your own wise decision.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Breaks a lot", "Author": "Math Lover", "ReviewID": "R2SKDVMZSGEJWP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had this laptop for only a couple months and it is still under warranty. The battery life is nice but I have already sent it in twice to be fixed.  The first time was because of a crashing issue and the second time was because a group of pixels in the screen died.  Each time I had to pay for shipping and was without a computer for more than a week.My real issue is that after getting the laptop back from the pixels issue, less than two days later more pixels died.  I called ACER customer support and they told me that I would have to pay for the screen to be replaced this time even though the laptop was still under warranty.  I find it unacceptable to be required to pay to replace something that they were just supposed to have fixed two days ago!", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Jack of All Trades...", "Author": "Gabe", "ReviewID": "RHYVALPQ84K24", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: Excellent overall package.Classy understated aesthetics, with a nice brushed aluminum finish.Solid construction, very rigid for it's size. Seems slimmer and smaller than you'd think for an 18.4\" screen.Keyboard ergonomics are good, keys are well spaced and have a nice tactile feedback.The removable touch-pad works well and is actually more than a novelty. It works in both normal and landscape orientation.System stays cool and quiet during normal use, and only gets a bit louder and warmer when running games.Speakers are surprisingly good, for a laptop mind you...The Hard Drive is formatted as just one partition (Yay!).Came pre-installed with Windows 7 Ultimate!? Not advertised as such, but thanks!Has a minimum of \"bloatware\". Took me about an hour to get everything the way I like it.Pretty much everything you could want in a \"desktop replacement\". An outstanding value for this role. There is nothing it can't do, truly a Jack of All Trades.Cons: Just a little shy in the memory dept. 1333mhz, or at least the option to upgrade would have been nice.The video card is not top-of-the-pile, but it is a nice mid-level card with good battery and thermal performance.The hard drive really shoulda been a 7200RPM. This machine has some serious horsepower but it somewhat hamstrung by it's slowish (but spacious!) hard drive.Other Thoughts: I have owned many laptops over the last 20 years, this is the best one yet. I use it for CAD, 3D Scanning, 3D Printing, Office Apps, Internet, Games, Videos, etc... While not the absolute best at any one of them, it excels at all of them.I would have paid another $200 for a better Hard Drive and Video Card.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "NOT worth the money", "Author": "Thomas Mueller \"tmspecial\"", "ReviewID": "R368YZ5QWBII1G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Acer didn't even bother to wire the 2nd hard drive bay.It costs you $60+ for the cable and brackets and lots of research to make the laptop usable.I will NEVER buy an Acer again.", "Date": "May 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Died after a year", "Author": "M.

It is fast and very nice, but nothing to be elated about.The PC performed as expected, fast.  I do wish the hard drive was 7200RPM, but quite honestly you don't really notice any PC being 5400RPM when doing \"normal\" activities.Videos played flawlessly, both from online streaming and from the Blu-Ray and DVD playerAudio was very good and loud.  I have heard slightly better audio from Samsung PCs, but this audio was nothing to be disappointed about.  I just had to boost the high end treble a little and it was the way I liked it to sound.  I annoyed my wife with plenty of music.The display was only decent.  Not spectacular.  I was really hoping it would be viewable from all angles, but like almost every laptop out there, when you sit close and the screen is display is angled away from you, even a little, then your display is a little more difficult to read and colors and contrast become muddied.  If you back away a meter, then the display looks fine.  I had just hoped that I would not have the muddying with vertical angles that I always encounter with laptops...The best part is the removable mouse pad!  You just pop it out and can use it from a few meters away to move the mouse around on the screen.  There is a special button on the mouse to switch to media-entertainment for audio or to switch to video.  It lets you fast-forward/rewind or skip to the next/prior songs or to select from a list of music that it catalogs for your from your hard drive (personally, I find cataloging my hard drive's media an annoying feature, what if I have embarassing vids of myself that I don't want displayed on the media menu?!!)It is large, and a little heavy, as you'd expect, but totally portable; I have no problems toting it around at all.It did *not* heat up excessively as I've encountered with other laptops that are processing hard.The first day's use did encounter some pausing of the system at times, which is quite normal as MS Windows builds new profiles, files, catalogs new things, etc. mostly related to initial use and setup, but after that first day it then ran quite smoothly.Again, this was not a super fast system as I'd over-anticipated it'd be, but it was still quite good.  ESPECIALLY for this price range for this sized screen!Note that this battery IS NOT REMOVABLE!  Well, unless you want to void your warranty and CAREFULLY open the case to get it out.  I hate when companies do this non-removable battery crap... Batteries only last 3 to 5 years!!!  And, if you're on the road, it's sometimes nice to purchase, charge up, and have a 2nd battery to swap out when you lack an outlet in your area (ex. my needing to still work a bit while camping or on the beach).You won't find another 18\" at this price, that's for sure... shoot, most 17\" comparables cost more than this 18\" model and offer nothing over this one's specifications and performance.I suggest getting an SSD (solid state drive) for this system, by the way, or a hybrid SSD 7200RPM drive... The SSD will give you longer battery life and better performance over the 5400RPM.", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Absolutely Fabulous", "Author": "Mikhail Brikman", "ReviewID": "R2I5Q7OBN8LVNA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product is Absolutely Fabulous!
