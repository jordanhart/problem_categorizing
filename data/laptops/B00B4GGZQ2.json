I am extremely happy with it so far. I really wish I had stayed w/ Toshiba when I bought the previous laptop, b/c I've had nothing but good luck w/ my Toshiba laptops (this is my 3rd in 10years).I did NOT like windows 8, at first - mainly b/c it's unfamiliar. I'm already starting to get used to the features & where everything is located. So far I'm still able to use all the same applications that I've been using for years, so I'm good...I would recommend this product!! & any Toshiba laptop, for that matter!", "Date": "August 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "great computer", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R3QMIV1ECJ0GIN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "its very fast, the battery life is roughly 2-4 hrs which isn't bad. The only problem that I have had is windows 8, its not computer friendly until you  change all of the settings to be more like XP or windows 7. Windows 8 is also overly susceptible to viruses and Trojans (Microsoft made another version of VISTA and they called it windows 8).", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrible product and even worse customer service", "Author": "Allen Gray", "ReviewID": "R16QAIVL4RS8EC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We have purchased four Toshiba products and have eventually had problems with EVERY ONE OF THEM.  To make matters worse, their customer service is outright horrible.  They don't want to resolve issues, they just want to get you off the phone.
