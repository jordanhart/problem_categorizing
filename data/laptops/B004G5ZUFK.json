{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fairly decent", "Author": "Luka the King", "ReviewID": "R3KW8E0HLAJCD3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is indeed one of the better computers i have owned laptop wise.the design is sleek and pleasant, coupled with it being lightweight it is quite the looker.The hard-were is upscale, the keyboard is responsive and sharp, no 'mooshy keys', the clicker buttons seem to die rather fast however, but a wireless mouse easily remedies this.  The touch pad is centered, leaving no room for 'wrist scrolling' that seems to be a BIG problem (for me anyway, when i'm trying to type) with other models.  Battery life seems low at first, but if you play with the settings enough, it will last a few hours longer then even the label on the battery itself says. the HDMI and basic computer monitor outputs are nice to have, and if set up properly, can lead to three scrolled screens which the processor can handle with no speed reduction.  All other basic ports are also standard, CD drive, USB ports, headphone / microphone, even SD card slot (which i was surprised by at how quickly the system reads the cards).  The fact that a webcam is optional, but the microphone is always included, is a bit of a let-down.  a webcam seems like a standard with any laptop nowadays.The screen is smooth, large, and pleasant, everything from basic programs to HD movies look superb.The system itself is nice, widows 7 cranks things out in a flash, IF your not doing too much.  The thing about this laptop is, that its a good work computer.  it works well for school, or business, as well as running basic programs and browsing.  but it should not be used as a gaming laptop by any stretch of the imagination, even mad amounts of upgrades would quickly put both your wallet and the laptop under deep water.  It does a good job of playing old games however, something for early XP, but the memory it needs might suck up a lot of your space.The filler and demo products are easily removed, unlike old systems where you had to install the full program, THEN uninstall it.  Even programs like internet explorer, (on my old laptop) you could not uninstall at all because it was a 'necessary program'.  But every program I have is non-stock, smaller file sized, and the laptop runs just the same, even faster in some cases.It is highly customizable, as it should be, but even things that were 'un-changeable', like the logon screen, can be changed very easily.All in all, a wonderful machine for a wonderful price (even though I got mine for $350 from a local store, and yes, its exactly the same, it was a sale), provided you get it for the right reason, and don't overload it.A great school computer that is reliable, strong, and fast.A definite buy.", "Date": "January 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "MOST AWSOME COMPUTER!!!", "Author": "computerguy", "ReviewID": "R2X8UGNUB7RNYU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best computer I have ever used.

It worked exactly as expected out of the box, but I was immediately disappointed by a slight curve in the key board. The keys in the center of the top half of the keyboard were all slightly lower than the others. It was odd, but in all the time it functioned I never had a problem typing, so I got over it.The second thing I noticed was that it was difficult to use the static mouse. It worked fine, but it was seamlessly integrated into the texture of the case. It looked neat, but it's easy to run your finger off the edge without realizing it, then you have to look down to reorient your hand. Again, it was minor and I got over it.Then, about a week later, I noticed the wear on the keys. The texture rubbed off amazingly fast. Again, minor, but looked grungy and the problems were starting to add up. I've typed daily on my 2003 dell for nearly a decade, and the keys still look better.Next came the heat. That computer got very hot, and the fan ran often and noisily. I already had a cooling pad for my old dell, so I started using that and enjoyed the nearly constant gush of warm air from the fan all winter long. My fingers get cold when I type. Over all, I'd say this problem was a wash......Except that all that heat was slowly destroying the video processor (which, after hours of research into the problem, I now know is fairly common). About three months in I first saw what I thought was an eye lash on my screen. It didn't brush off, and it didn't wipe away. \"Oh well,\" I thought, some reviewers said they got dead pixels. I knew that coming in. A week later I got another, then another a few weeks after that. Then things seemed to settle, though every now and then a few more pixels would wink out. I've since been told that the little strings of black pixels were probably not dead. I was told that if they'd been bad pixels they would have been bright, not black, so they were most likely advanced signs of a dying video processor.About a year and a month after my ill fated purchase the screen failed to come on when I opened the computer. I could hear the start up sounds and the welcome to windows fanfare blared from the speakers, but no video. I closed the lid and reopened, then I restarted, then I restrained myself from banging it against my head. It worked fine the next day, and for a few weeks after. I scanned with Windows Security Essentials and Malware bytes and called it a fluke. Then it happened again, and again, and so on for several months before the screen went dark for good. I scoured the internet (with my wife's Mac) for a cause and solution. I discovered that external monitors still worked so I hooked it up to my TV. I rolled back the system, reloaded drivers, and a dozen other useless fixes. I was about to format the hard drive when the external monitor became garbled and went black.The computer lasted for a year and a half. I have since come to learn the the problem is most likely a bad solder connection in the video processor. I can either buy a new mother board, or try to heat and reconnect the one I've got (apparently people have had some success heating the board with a heat gun or in the oven). For now it's just sitting on a shelf. I bought a nearly identical Toshiba Satellite C655D for fifty bucks less. I've had it for a month and I am very happy with the build quality (Somehow it's lighter AND sturdier!) It has a little less processing power, a little more ram, bigger hard drive, a full size keyboard, multi-touch function for the mouse, a web cam, a media card reader, and a super bright display (this is the first computer I've ever been able to use outside on a sunny day). It also runs cooler, quieter (I have yet to hear the fan), and more consistently. My only complaints so far are the too-quiet speakers (I sometimes have trouble hearing quiet youtube videos even in a silent room), and the very faint *dub* noise my battery makes every time I pick up the computer. It is more than a fair trade. Just keep an eye on Toshiba.com and Best Buy for a decent sale and steer clear of the CQ62.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Recommended", "Author": "Dj Deivid", "ReviewID": "R1FJONEQUMHDU8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've got this laptop a month ago and i have no problems with it...

My laptop's keyboard died around a year and a half after being bought, and replacements wouldn't register; something within the keyboard connectors, itself, may be the issue.DON'T PANIC, for there are many, many USB keyboard accessories on the market that are the exact size of the space the normal keyboard takes up. Buy one, and it'll sit neatly in the slot, with no silver internal workings visible!

While in 2010 having only 2GB of RAM is understandable shipping even a bottom-end computer a single-core processor is a crime.

Also the 2 year-old system had a bad battery that wouldn't hold a charge at all (again, a criminally short life).After a security scan found nothing wrong I turned to the crapware to find the default Compaq image used almost 1/3 of the RAM to run useless crapware and it used 3/4 of the RAM sitting idle after boot. Ran MSCONFIG, turned it all off, and viola it ran fine and had 2/3 of the 2GB available.

The touch pad is an absolute joke. A small, undefined area for scrolling and a very narrow bar for clicking make it a nightmare to navigate through pages and to drag and drop. I have to use it with an external mouse. There is also no guide to the many function keys on the keyboard that it touts. It also often turns off the WiFi connection off and gives very poor guidance as to how to turn it back on. When trouble shooting my loss of connection for the first time, I was so frustrated that almost threw it out the window. The diagnostic system told me the WiFi connection was off but did not offer to tun it back on and gave very vague guidance as to how to turn it back on. It turns out that it's just one of the many function keys.

My laptop broke, so I began using my mom's Compaq US62-whatever until I could afford a new one. Since then, this laptop has brought me endless frustration and anger, and honestly has lowered my quality of life a bit. It is EXTREMELY slow, and when I say \"extremely\" I mean that if you simply \"right click\" on a blank space on the desktop, the right click menu HAS TO LOAD. Seriously??? It took me about 15 minutes just to get to this webpage so I can release some of my anger with this silly review. I have a netflix account which is being wasted, because streaming video is impossible. There is nothing wrong with our wireless internet, either; all of our other computers and wireless devices work just fine. I've tried troubleshooting our wireless and everything else. When I brought it to my mother's attention that her laptop is ridiculously slow, she simply stated \"it's not good at multi-tasking.\" HAVING MORE THAN ONE TAB OPEN ON MOZILLA FIREFOX IS NOT MULTI-TASKING!!! She uses the computer maybe 2 hours a week, to go couponing and to check her email. Even with those two activities, she recognizes the computer as slow. So, if you're thinking of gaming, watching video, or doing anything besides staring at the desktop waiting for a program to load - this is not the computer for you.Besides it's pitiful slowness, it is also really big and clunky for no reason. The trackpad is awkward, gets greasy very easily, and hurts your wrists. The keys are black, so its impossible to see in the dark. The only plus I can think of is that the screen is kind of big, but the quality isn't superb and what's the point of a big screen if THE MACHINE DOESN'T WORK AS INTENDED. When people wonder why Mac is overtaking Windows/PC, this is exactly why. Windows licenses it's operating system to lackluster, low budget companies who put the same amount of thought into their computers as a fat dude on a frito-lays assembly line. These people just want to make a quick $400 off of you.Honestly, don't waste your money.. You may be allured by the cheap cost, but the machine is quite frankly a poor excuse for a laptop.

The start up time is quite fast, and the internet connects great anywhere in the house. As long as the computer is not used for heavy duty work requiring multiple programs running at once, anyone would love this computer. It also has a great webcam and a easy to use keyboard. I do not like the mouse-pad though so I had to get a wireless mouse. It just isn't comfortable to use like other laptops. I use a Dell Inspiron with an i-3 processor and 4gb of ram for my heavier duty work load where I can run multiple programs. So if you are looking for a laptop that requires heavy duty work or for going off to school, get another one. One that has at least an i3 processor, 4gb of ram, and 250gb hard drive. That's just the minimum. I recommend 6gb to 8gb of ram, 500gb to 1tb hard drive, and a i5 or i7 processor.
