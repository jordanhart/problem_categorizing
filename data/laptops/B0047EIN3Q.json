Have to wiggle the plug to get it to charge and be careful that you don't bump it or you have to wiggle the cord again. This should not be happening, the laptop is only about 6 months old. This laptop comes with no web-cam. I would not reccomend this laptop to anyone.", "Date": "June 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Do not buy", "Author": "freedom", "ReviewID": "R2IBXZ4M316VYR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Very cheap lost hard drive got a new one(hard drive) and it will not boot. stay far away from this one", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0047EIN3Q"}}
