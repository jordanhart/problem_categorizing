{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Laptop", "Author": "Masslfe", "ReviewID": "R23H2RY965R6XM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this from another retailer with the i5 processor, which was more than enough speed.  I hadn't had any slowdowns even before I upgraded certain items. Windows 8 takes a bit to get used to but so far I like it.  I'm getting more used to the app OS's like Android so the mixture in Windows 8 is becoming more convenient.I still like the 15\" size over the smaller sizes so this was the way to go for me.  I also find it convenient to have a keypad on the laptop since it cuts some inefficiency when doing a lot of accounting work.  I also felt that if I were to get a new laptop with Win 8 I'd have to go touchscreen and that, I feel, has been a great advantage - makes surfing the web and other tasks much quicker than using a mouse.I'm used to an ASUS UL50VT so the screen was no drop off and thus I was still used to the 1366x768 resolution, some may find it lacking but for the price, you've gotta expect some shortcomings - I'm tired of seeing people posting how the screen is terrible when you're only trying to spend $500-700 on the thing.I'm not sure about the other touchscreen laptops (from my research many of the others are difficult to upgrade in the ultrabook sizing) but it's easy to take off the bottom cover to add RAM (I added aCorsair Vengeance 8GB (1x8GB) DDR3 1600 MHz (PC3 12800) Laptop  Memory (CMSX8GX3M1A1600C10) bought off Amazon for $40 - NOTE: many stats say you can only add another 4 GB but I've found others using the S400CA were able to upgrade up to 12 GB instead).  This allowed me to push(through the BIOS) dedicated graphics RAM to 512 MB. I also replaced the drive with a SAMSUNG 830 Series 2.5-Inch 256GB SATA III MLC Internal Solid State Drive (SSD) MZ-7PC256B/WW.  The hard part was reinstalling an upgraded windows (Windows 8 core which this comes with lacks support for media center) which required putting the Win 8 Pro iso on a jump drive (adding an ei.cfg file stating[Channel]Volume[VL]1 to the sources folder) and turning off secure boot in the BIOS.  Make sure to also download all the drivers on the ASUS website.  The only thing requiring a specific install order is the IRST and Express Cache installation.The touchpad can be a bit annoying sometimes but once I get used to the click points I'm sure it'll be fine.I also wanted to add bluetooth since mine didn't come with the wireless so I added the Intel Network 6235AN.HMWWB Centrino WiFi Card Advanced-N 6235 Dual Band Bluetooth Retail for $22 which worked out perfectly.  It would've been nice if I didn't have to replace some of these things but at the price I got my S500CA for, it was well worth the additional hassle.  If you can find a better 15\" touchscreen laptop with the ASUS warranty for these prices please let me know.  Also with ASUS brand quality.  I don't think there are any new ones at this price (refurbs may come close).I believe the mSATA drive could be upgradeable if I took off the anchor removing the drive but I didn't want to fully void the warranty (the drive is located to the right of the black plastic covering under the MB ribbon).Finally, I'm a bit old school so the only game I really play regularly is CS:Source and this laptop was good enough to run it at 60 frames/sec on mid level settings, even better than my UL50VT.Overall it's a great laptop with quality build and I'd recommend it for anyone.", "Date": "March 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far so Perfect!", "Author": "Duderino", "ReviewID": "RPLKAU08K2CM2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Overall:Fast, responsive, lightweight, solid.Screen:720p is off-putting after being used to 1080p or better. I overlook it because I knew those were the specs when I bought it.The touchscreen aspect is solid, no lags, very responsive.HDD:Before I replaced the hard drive, I thought it was really fast. The use of the 24GB mSATA is key here. I don't think the ultrabook would be any use without it.HDD upgrade to SSD:And I thought the hybrid aspect was fast, this baby is blazing. 5 seconds or less to get this baby running, 5 seconds or less to shut down. I loaded Win 8 without all the bloatware, it's amazing. Very easy, the BIOS seems to have kept my Win8 license key, so the install of the OS was easy with a USB DVD drive.6GB RAM:Plenty of memory for what I need it for: browsers, word processing, pic/vid viewing, skype, eReader, etc. I might upgrade eventually, but so far so good. Windows OS handles RAM a little differently since VISTA. More free RAM isn't necessarily a good thing anymore. Win8 handles everything very efficiently.WIFI:Just had to update the driver and most problems go away. I still ordered the Intel Centrino Dual-band N wifi card because I have randomly lost wifi connection a couple of times. Not a big deal for me though.Bluetooth:Works as expected. My mouse connected perfectly. EDIT: at first it did but it's having trouble staying connected. I'm working on figuring out if it's the mouse, the OS, or the hardware. will update hopefullyTouchpad:Takes a while to get used to, but once you \"get it\" you're good. There are two types of clicking, soft-click, which is like a traditional pad, and hard-click, where you physically depress and release the touchpad.Battery:I get about 3.5 hours with this baby full charged. Not bad for me, but I also haven't done an official test with it yet. I think I can get 4 hours of use if I wanted though. My power settings for battery-only are optimized to not sacrifice processing power, but other things like brightness and sleep-logic.Other:HDMI port works flawlessly, tried it out on my 50\" PLasma for Game of Throne season premiere. 3 USB ports are plenty these days. I haven't tried out the LAN and SD card inputs yet. Will update when I have made any other upgrades.Disclaimer:IF you plan on buying this device, and don't swap out any of the parts, be sure to UPDATE YOUR DRIVERS ([...].  Additionally, ASUS has some bloatware that does more harm-than-good, I believe the power-something utility is the worst.

I debated for a long time between a touchscreen laptop (portable) versus a laptop that has superior processing capability with a good video card (a dinosaur).  However, I realized that I wanted something to be able to take to a caf\u00e9 or a library and be able to do my homework and other work.So from this point on, I'm just going to write my review based on what information that I find useful in the buying process.LOOKSSmooth edges all around, aluminum all around with the exception of the bottom panel, which is a smooth-rubberized finished. Screen is glossy and contained mostly glass, so it is a good idea to invest in a typical clear screen protector. There's none at the moment, but you can find by a third-party seller on ebay.OPERATING SYSTEMGet retroUI or startdock version to bring the \"start\" button backHARDWAREThis laptop has a 4GB built in ram with one additional ram slot. This model comes with 6GB so there's an additional 2GB stick in the slot. Speakers are on the bottom (they sounds great by the way! I would say it's louder and clearer than the typical speakers and \"beats\" brand on HP's envy line). SD slot is there but your card will stick out like a sore thumb.TOUCHSCREEN/TOUCHPADNavigating on the touchscreen is smooth and doesn't produce that much lag when you're zooming in or out. The response is quick and accurate. The touchpad too, is responsive. The thing I like about the touchpad is that it is not raised above or below the hand-rest area (it's also a bigger than most touchpads). If you press down firmly in the center, it'll do a right-click.UPGRADESI'm waiting for my SSD to come in next week so I can have it run all SSD instead of the slower 500GB HDD. There's a lot of guides out there explaining how to upgrade if you are interested. However, since I don't have a windows 8 installer cd (yeah I know fresh install is better), I usually use Acronis to clone my SSD (I did this with my other two laptops and it works fine after minor adjustment post-cloning).PROBLEMS ENCOUNTEREDI had an issue with my wifi not working after updating windows, installing avg and updating asus update utility. I couldn't figure which of the three caused the problem in the first place so I tried doing a system restore. Of course, that didn't work, so I was forced to do a factor reset since the laptop was pretty new anyway. After updating windows update again, I didn't install avg, but rather avast, and I haven't update the asus update utility yet. So far I don't have any wifi issue and I've backed up all of my files, just in case.Check out my other images of this laptop, it might be helpful!UPDATE 4.09.13Just installed a Samsung 840 series 250GB SSD (7mm) this afternoon and everything is running fast, very fast. Boot and shut-down time is significantly reduced. I wanted to get the crucial m4 version but I couldn't find the \"7mm\" version on sale so I had to go with the Samsung.No problem(s) at the moment.UPDATE 3.30.13I had some issues with smart gesture not working. It would automatically disappear after I resume and reappear after I restart the laptop. It already happened twice, so I went and uninstalled the old driver and updated it with a new one from ASUS website. So far it's working fine and I noticed improvement in the touch response Ex. two finger touch (to bring up menu) is quick and more accurate compared to the older driver.The keyboard protector in my pictures can be purchased by a third party if you search for keyboard for ASUS K55A-DH71.", "Date": "March 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Powerful Specs in a Gorgeous and Affordable Package.", "Author": "Joseph J.", "ReviewID": "R15CHQ50JLE3TM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros+ Bang for your buck--you get a fairly powerful machine with great features for not  lot of money.+ Gorgeous design--this thing is beautiful to look at on or off (all my friends want one).+ Fast--performs well and boots up very quickly; the instant-on feature is awesome.+ Portable--while large, this thing is very light. The power brick is compact, too.+ Glass screen is not only very pretty, but makes the touch-interface a joy to use.Nitpicks- Let's all agree that Windows 8 is a tragedy.- Mechanical HDD--while they're cheap and you're given a lot of hdd space, they're fragile and always precarious in notebooks.- Low resolution screen--hey, they had to cut back somewhere to make this so affordable, but nothing I'm not used to (coming from a Asus UL50VT, which has the same resolution). Still, the colors are vibrant.- Touchpad mouse is disobedient. It works, but sometimes it's not very responsive--especially the smart gestures.- Subpar keyboard--it's functional, but there's flex and the travel distance is too shallow.- Stretches the boundary on \"ultrabook.\"- Shameful battery life.Let's be clear, for the amount you're paying, you're getting an absolutely gorgeous laptop that packs a punch for very little money--which is why I jumped on this as soon as I learned about it. I see this machine as the successor to the absolutely awesome UL50VT, which was a great machine for the price. I am glad to see that Asus has continued the tradition of offering powerful, feature-rich machines for the fiscally conscientious.This machine is able to keep up with me as a multitasking \"poweruser\" (I'll watch movies and open about thirty tabs in Chrome while I write stuff in Word). The 6GB of ram really goes far in offering smooth performance. The i5 processor is fairly beefy, too, and is able to handle just about everything I threw at it without complaint. While this machine has no dedicated graphics card, do not let that fool you; I was genuinely shocked (and happy) that I could run Starcraft II: Heart of the Swarm well on \"medium\" settings.The glass screen is both gorgeous and makes the touch screen a joy to use. The colors are surprisingly vibrant, and it's actually hard to tell sometimes that the screen is not 1080p, but for a 15.6\" screen, the resolution is still quite low--though, I am used to this because my old UL50VT had the same issue. Also, the speakers are actually pretty decent thanks to the SonicMaster technology they employ.The notebook is also very light, which makes it very easy to transport. However, its size does stretch the boundaries of what an \"ultrabook\" is. While easy to transport for its weight, its large size is a little unwieldy for what I'd consider a truly \"go-and-compute-anywhere\" experience. As well, the battery life is actually shockingly bad. I could squeeze 9 hours of battery life from the UL50VT, whereas this thing gets a little over 4 and a half hours at best, which feels like a step back. This also hinders portability in that you don't get terribly long to use it off the cord. At least, however, the power brick is small and highly portable--though I wish it were a tad longer. Ultimately, this machine is a lot more portable than the UL50VT that I had.My one true disappointment is the keyboard, which as I mentioned above, has a far too shallow travel distance. Typing on this machine, therefore, is functional (my wpm has not been affected) but far from a pleasant experience--something about it just feels off.Bottom line, this is just a great machine that can't be beat for the price. Other notebook computers with similar specs cost a lot more than this. Couple great performance with beautiful design, and you get an affordable ultrabook that's frankly hard to beat. Sure, there are drawbacks here and there, but for what you are paying, you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "April 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Keyboard issues = big problem", "Author": "EmElle", "ReviewID": "R31LX51L1ZY16M", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was so excited when my computer arrived. I glanced at the directions, turned it on, and was ready to be impressed. It is a really nice machine, seems well-built, and I got through most of the initial set-up with no problems. The real problem began when I tried to type full sentences. The space bar, despite being fully pressed, would only register about half the time. This is absolutely not going to fly. I can't imagine a scenario when I would need a computer without a working keyboard. I had read in reviews of other Asus laptops that there were issues with the keyboard, but assumed that those complaints were not the norm (they very well may not be, but my experience indicates otherwise).I am now in the process of returning my computer. I will say, though, that the packaging was great and the computer arrived really quickly.

Within six months of owning this machine, I had to send it back to ASUS for service because the machine was constantly crashing (blue screen every 10-15 minutes).The product was returned in a timely matter and ASUS even managed to save my data. I'm willing to chalk it up to a bad hard drive and wouldn't have much of a complaint about this minor inconvenience.This is, until it started to happen again, six weeks later. This time, completely locking me out of Windows because of a critical system error.After running into countless walls on the ASUS site, I finally got a representative on the phone, where the only solution proposed was entirely wiping my hard drive, removing every file (mp3, video, photo of my child) and all my programs.I've owned this machine for eight months and had two MAJOR problems. Now, I have to start from square one, and I can confidently say, wiping the hard drive isn't going to solve the hardware failings this machine is having.I blame myself for not backing up my data. I should have been more careful after the first episode. This is what I get for trusting ASUS after the initial warning signs.Regardless to say, I can't recommend this product or this company.

Keys are not responsive and require the press to be hard and directly in the center to register. Pressing the key on a corner (even to the point it looks fully depressed) will not register. Not at all suitable for heavy typing work.Touchpad:Large and responsive. With two finger scrolling and enhancement, I found myself using the mousepad far more than the touchscreen.Touchscreen:Responsive, but honestly not nearly as useful as I anticipated. In almost all situations, it's easier to just use the pad for clicking/scrolling than reaching over the keyboard to press something. I did not use any illustration software, but the multi-touch capability seemed responsive. Honestly, if I were go through the purchase process again, I'd go for something without the touchscreen.Performance:Works fast, but still a little slower than I anticipated. I chalk it up to the extra power needed for the touchscreen. Also had it randomly shut off on me without warning a couple times at 50%+ battery power remaining.Battery:I can get anywhere from 3-6 hours depending on use. A single word document at low brightness gets me 6 hours, while multiple browsing tabs/programs or video only gets me 3.WIFI:After reading other reviews I made sure the first thing I did was update drivers, so WIFI has worked great for me.

So I'm used to different types of tech and have been using Windows 8 for a couple of months (albeit on a Surface Pro). Seemed logical to give a touchscreen laptop a try, and Asus has a pretty good reputation.The Asus Ultrabook S500-CA had some decent reviews, and the main draw (other than being pretty big for an ultrabook with not the greatest battery  life) was that the touchpad is 'quirky'. Other people have commented on this, and yes, I HAVE to agree. I adore touchpads. I rarely use a mouse w/ a laptop because it's in my lap most of the time (yes, bad ergo). This pc might break me of the habit unless I get the touchpad reset properly. I can't tell you how many times my screen has zoomed out because of this touchpad. But it should be fixable (there's comments below on resetting). It's just annoying as all heck.I also find that sometimes the touchscreen isn't very responsive. I don't know if it's the site I'm on, my browser (it seems to freeze up on the net most of the time) or what. Sometimes it won't let me close apps or is a pain to do it. Sometimes it doesn't let me scroll. I don't seem to have this problem w/ my Surface. But I'd say it works 95% of the time (I have to admit that I have a different web browser on the Surface).Speaking of my apps, it's a pain how some of them pop up all the time when I don't want them to, and I have to spend a few minutes getting them to close (see screen).These have been the most annoying issues w/ the laptop so far. Well, that and figuring out the keyboard. Having the number keys on the side causes the keys to be a little offset, and it took a few days to get used to it. But that's something that you can get used to (or I did). Other than that, it's figuring out where one of the two deletes are that's bugging me the most. Not the most intuitive changes there.But the laptop is nice and light for its size. Screen graphics are pretty good (it's not the greatest for gaming, but for everyday use and video viewing, it's nice) as is sound. Speed has been decent. I'm still trying to figure out the why's of the HD partitioning, but maybe that's just me.Quirks aside, it's a light, sleek pc that works well, is responsive (maybe too responsive) for the most part and is meeting my every day needs. The longer I use it and figure it out, the less quirks there are. I like the pc, I just wish it had a better OS on it.

I bought the computer about a month (beginning of August) before my daughter started college so we could learn Windows 8 and get her computer set up for school.  My daughter had no problem figuring out how to navigate through Windows 8 and I was able to catch on pretty quickly.  I consider myself about a 4 on a 10 point scale when it comes to walking the talk with computers.  We had no issues with the key board as has been suggested by some reviewers.  Typing was comfortable and did not have to press down hard on the keys.  Bottom line, you have to get used to it.  I was able to remove some of the unnecessary programs/bloatware that was installed.  The one thing I did miss was having the DVD drive.  I had to use the internet to download and install drivers for the printer we purchased.  That took some time and would have been much quicker with the disc.  Other than that, you really don't need a DVD drive now days with everything downloadable through the internet.We both loved the aesthetics of the computer with it being pretty thin and easy to transport.  It was a little bigger than expected with the 15.6 inch screen and in hindsite may have purchased the 13 inch for a little more room in the handbag...my daughter's not mine :-).  The touch screen was very responsive and again, had no problems navigating and moving from screen to screen including the programs and apps that we were using.  All Microsoft Office products worked well both using the touch screen or pad.

TouchScreen responsive and compensates for the sometimes finicky touchpad (which is ok because I use the touchscreen anyways & it is a touchscreen laptop  So i).I see why there isn't too much attention paid to its built. However, one can alter the settings to decrease the response delay between touchpad clicks gestures etc which does help with its usability...-Also I don't know if this is just an iTunes thing but if music is played from iTunes library the volume seems to automatically adjust to the pitch of the musics highs and lows. Other than that its great crisp powerful sounds coming from these speakers. I haven't played around with the speakers enough to make sure its just iTunes just being weird. I don't think the speakers react the same when I'm watching YouTube vids, that's something I keep forgetting to actually pay attention to which probably means for me that its just iTunes player attempting to make my speakers last longer (thanks Apple didn't know you cared so much :-) haha).Likes: first I love playing games on it both Microsoft and Android (download bluestacks app frm the play store). Touchscreen really enhances the windows 8 experience! I like being able to create shortcuts on both the desktop screen and the tiles screen and group the tiles as I want. Being a college student I purchased it for college essays as well and being that the keys aren't backlit the touchscreen keyboard comes in handy often for those late hrs and all nighter essays and it feels cool to use reminds me of my android HTC evo LTe keyboard. You can control almost anything from the touchscreen. I installed Google chrome browser instead of using explorer but both are likeable to me. Usb 3.0 makes file transfers a breeze, the solid state drive produces noticable speed for quick access minus the lockscreen I wouldn't ever wanna bypass. If you have use Netflix or YouTube often to watch vids or movies then the disk drive is not necessary its cheaper to purchase an external anyways and you can find one for around $30 that plays dvd blueray etc that's also not a cheaply made product. The weight is great much slimmer and lighter than my 5+ yr old Dell Inspiron 15 and much faster and of better quality. The quality build of this laptop is very remnant of MacBooks with a sleek unibody design that incases everything including the non removable battery which lasts about 4/5hrs. This reminds makes me think they are the HTC one of the computer world as far as build quality goes which rivals Apple. Also the keyboard is very responsive and has a full number pad so one is not searching for the number keys at the top unless they enjoy it haha. Or just make use of the touch screen again. I suggest getting a screen protector just as you would with a touchscreen phone these days to ensure there won't be any accidental scratches. Also this will protect the camera which isn't the best but will do if your not an avid Skype user like myself.. or one can just purchase a webcam and plug into the usb drive and your all set with a crisper connection.All in all, this is a great product that I have compared directly to all others like it except for Macs because I wasn't going to purchase one anyways (expensive). This laptop makes college life or and type of computer based/related activities much easier amd sometimes a breeze if you use Bing or google voice search apps which make it fun. I can tell that Asus spent time on this product and I appreciate every bit of it. This makes a great purchase for self or gift for any level college student or an adult who's just in the market for a laptop in general and mite want a touch screen. Last but not least, this Asus Vivobook model on up can compete with nearly every laptop out there running any windows versions by specs Comparison and build quality.Im a tech geek and i approve of this product (and I don't approve of too many)Hope I helped someone make a decision!", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop", "Author": "Scott Sanders", "ReviewID": "RT6S4NYQ02L76", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great looking hardware, good performance. would absolutely recommend as a standard laptop.

I was sorely mistaken. The problems begin with the design. The case material is so thin that any flex causes the touchpad to generate a mouse click.I tried to get it serviced, but that caused even more problems. After returning it and not hearing from ANYONE for over 2 weeks, I tried contacting service. I was told that the unit had sustained severe damage and I would receive a call from a manager within 3 days. TWO MORE WEEKS with no communication and I contacted service through the online ticketing system to see what was going on. I received an email indicating that I would have to pay over $200.00 for the repairs, parts and shipping to get my unit back. They included a photo which was indiscernible, indicating it was a broken screen. I tried replying to the email as indicated, but the mailbox was full, so I sent it back to the ticketing system administrator who redirected it to the service agent. I explained that I had insurance and needed evidence that the damage was caused by the shipper since the unit was shipped in the original vendor packaging and therefore packed properly. I immediately received a response that they would reduce the charges to the cost of the part.Again, I tried to reply (full mailbox) and had to go to the ticketing system administrator to say that I wanted my unit back, so I would pay the ransom, but I wanted to be sure that the ORIGINAL PROBLEM, which I returned the unit to get repaired for, would be fixed.I received my \"repaired\" laptop back in another week and guess what? The cursor still jumps when the unit flexes....DESIGN PROBLEM...I have tried to correspond with the \"full mailbox\" and the service administrator, but neither would respond. I am thinking about reporting it as fraud to my credit card company.Now you might say how am I qualified to call this a design problem? Well, I was the VP of engineering for a major contract manufacturer with deign teams in 7 countries on 3 continents. My teams and my company produced over 20million PCs for Dell, HP, IBM, NEC, NCR, DEC, Toshiba and Intel.

It looks like a much fancier computer than you would normally get for the $600 range. It seems to run quickly - I streamed some videos last night and the image quality was excellent. I couldn't make up my mind about the sound - it had more bass than my previous laptop but still managed to sound like it was playing in a bathroom. Maybe I need to get used to it.Mouse pad: the mouse has a soft click and a hard click (where you press the whole pad down). I'm not loving the mouse, it doesn't always seem to register soft clicks, and I find myself repeatedly tapping on it. It does however have the nice two finger scroll feature that macs have had for years, which I definitely like.Keyboard: definitely not loving. It's very similar to a mac keyboard (except it is a proper full keyboard, not one of those truncated mac things) but the keys require a lot more pressure than my old laptop and you have to hit them square in the middle. It's not enough to just catch the side of them. Typing is a little tricky right now. However, it is a full keyboard, which is excellent.Touch screen: very responsive. I have never owned  a touch screen before so I can't compare and contrast, but I have had no problems selecting even small objects.Comes with a tonne of bloatware and has taken some tweaking, but I'm no computer whizz kid and I've found this relatively pain free. There are still a few things to figure out, like how I keep accidentally bringing up the right hand side bar (windows 8 users will know what I'm talking about) but all in all after 24 hours I'm pleased with this purchase. Thus far, at least, it feels like a good deal, although darn this keyboard is killing me right now!UPDATE: after having this for a few months I'm generally happy with it. I've had no issues, it still runs quickly, and without the bloatware seems to function perfectly. Only downsides are the keyboard is really awful. The keys must be hit with absolute precision and some force meaning the typing feels more like a typewriter than a laptop keyboard. The mouse is also not great. It is very sensitive to sideways movements which means with windows 8 you are always accidentally bringing up either the sidebar or the programs that run in the start menu (if you have windows 8 you'll get what I mean)and I find I tend to click \"through\" things, by which I mean, for example, if I type in a url when I click on the dropdown menu with the option it often clicks on that and then the option underneath (usually something from my favourites bar but once on a banner ad that led to chaos).

I've installed three (3) different network cards and none of them is able to hold a stable connection for more than four (4) hours on this laptop with one of the NICs I purchased. With the default NIC I'm lucky if it holds a stable connection for over 90 minutes. I've tried with both the Windows 8 default HDD and the Windows 7 SSD.

I might try Ubuntu next, but I honestly have lost my patience with this laptop.Original review below with a few edits.First the good: Lightweight, looks nice on the surface, touchscreen is fun, (when it works correctly)and it's really cheap for a touch-screen laptop.Now for the bad: This computer has already had RAM issues, blue screened and resolved all by itself... Having had this computer for less than 3 months that's as good an indication as any that this is not a quality, durable product.EDIT: This hasn't yet happened under Windows 7 so it might have been Windows 8 tripping out, as per usual.This laptop is a system administrator's worst nightmare. It constantly drops connections, even with a new wireless card and updated drivers. I know it isn't my router or internet because my other windows computer, android phone & tablet, and iPad connect just fine.The speakers are near blowing up even though the sound is low and awful at ALL times. (Using a decibel meter at ear length and volume set to maximum (100) I get an average of 61 Decibels from these speakers, peaking at 74. Maximum volume on this thing is 81 decibels if I set the decibel meter so close to the speakers it actually touches them.) To make matters worse the speakers are on the bottom of the laptop so it's very easy to obstruct the little sound they produce.EDIT: The speakers almost seem louder under Windows 7, kind of confused here as to why but it was a pleasant surprise. I've bought the Logitech USB Laptop Speaker Z305 so this is no longer an issue for me either way.You have to open up the laptop to remove battery, it's very easy to do, but still annoying considering almost every computer not made by Apple has an easily removable battery. I think Asus was trying to copy Apple BIG time with this laptop, but in all the wrong ways. If I liked or wanted an Apple product I'd buy one...The touchscreen and mouse seem to be interconnected in the way they handle touch input. More often than not my screen acts like the touchpad, and my touchpad simply doesn't respond. Could be driver issues, I'll be re-installing windows 8, maybe even 7 this weekend and I'll update again.Edit: On Windows 7 this issue rarely occurs and when it does it's almost always when the battery is below 15%. I can live with that.The camera has a lower quality than most front facing cameras on modern smartphones, and you have to fix the settings before using it because the contrast and brightness are way to high by default)This last bit is about the software, but still very important. You can't easily instal other versions of Windows or format your HDD or SSD the way you used to in previous iterations, so for a lot of people who purchase this computer, you will be stuck with the OS that came pre-installed.Windows 8 has many, many bugs. I upgraded to Windows 8 Pro thinking this would solve most of the issues, turns out I was wrong. Most recently it wouldn't allow me to open downloads by simply double clicking on them giving me an error. To resolve this I have to right click and Run as administrator every single time I want to run something I just finished downloading. Office 2013... It took about 4+ hours to download and install. Works fine, not much has been updated from Office 2010 at all, so not worth the update in my opinion. Next, it takes about 2-3 hours to download \"fixes\", which are mandatory and don't fix anything. The option \"refresh your PC without affecting your files\" took about 2 hours and again produced a lovely error informing me it was unsuccessful. No product key sticker so to re-install windows you'll need to use a program like Belarc to find your product key. Some files wont open from the Desktop, you have to open them from the metro interface. Default windows security settings seem to only trap false-positives. If you were used to having a black start menu, toolbar etc be prepared because Windows 8 allows you to do this, but keeps the text dark too so you can't see what is written, the minimize buttons, etc... I hope Windows 8.1 (Blue) fixes these issues as it is really a much faster, but also much less reliable OS then Windows 7.(I wonder if this computer might be better if used with Windows 7 or Ubuntu?)EDIT: It definitely is better under Windows 7 and I've experienced none of these software issues.", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "The issue started with the windows 8 and the touch pad acts weird and automatically selects random icons.", "Author": "Suresh Gopalan", "ReviewID": "R1T0TO7QQ77A4C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Hate this Windows 8 product.
