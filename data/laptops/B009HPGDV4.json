The brands included Gateway, Emachine, Pbell, Asus, Dell, Toshiba etc. and a beloved Sony Vaio.In my opinion, I have always thought Sony screens were superior to other brands (with the exception of Apple of course) the screen quality has always been very important to me, and again Sony excels. The screen is simply, stunning.I was concerned with ordering online, a pink laptop. I was worried the color would be too loud.  The color is perfect! It is not loud at all; it is a very soft cotton candy pink.The laptop feels solid. It is also not a super heavy or bulky laptop, but also not as thin as an ultabook. It has a thin lid that keeps it somewhat light.I love the soft glow from the keyboard. I often like to sit at night with only a few candles burning and the TV and fireplace on, playing on my laptop and this feature fits perfectly into my life style.I also love the speedy start up feature. Never saw anything like it. You can shut the laptop totally down, lift the lid and in a few seconds you are ready to go.Windows 8 has some strange features; example a swipe with your mouse from the top of the screen to the bottom closes your program. I also spent more than a few minutes looking for the X to close programs and looking for the non existing start button.  But overall I like Windows 8.The laptop itself is very speedy. I watched a few HD movies on netflex and they ran perfectly with no lag. I also like to play online Facebook games etc., again the speed was lighting fast.I can't comment on the battery, because I almost never unplug my laptop so this feature is not important to me.The price is a very good value. I didn't want to spend over $500.00 since I normally replace my laptop every few years. I saw this pc listed for $60.00 bucks more and went the extra mile. I am so glad I did.I also love Amazon. I have been a member with Amazon since they started back in the 90's. I have never had any issues at all with Amazon. I also knew if I was not satisfied or happy, Amazon would, as they always do take care of me. So I was very confident placing my order.What I don't like about this laptop, nothing. I totally love it!Sony VAIO E15 Series SVE15124CXP 15.5-Inch Laptop (Pink)", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!", "Author": "L.

It arrived on time and I had it set up on no time. Wasn't sure if I would like Windows 8, but it works well for me and it didn't take long to get the hang of the new start menu tiles.

It's not an obnoxious pink like many other pink shaded laptops, which is what first drew my interest. The programs that come with this laptop such as Vegas Movie Studio and Acid Music Studio are great as well.I have two problems with this laptop.1) The left/right click mouse buttons are terribly frustrating. It took me awhile to get used to them, and even now they still aggravate me.2) The casing on the side of the laptop seems to be rather poorly put together. Not even three months after buying this laptop brand new, the casing on the side starting coming off and it has gradually gotten worse.EDIT:-Half of the bottom part of my casing has now ripped off completely.-There is a constant white line running down the middle of my screen, indicating I need a new one.Perhaps my laptop was defected when I first got it, but I will never buy a Sony laptop ever again.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointed. Windows 8 is useless also.", "Author": "N. Markova", "ReviewID": "R3OZJOZ1K140PA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "OK, so got this because I had a Samsung last which was an absolute lemon and crashed in every way within a year.First observation. Often I click on things and nothing happens. I have to click many times.It also crashes if you try and run too much.I am a photographer and enjoy doing preliminary editing in Windows 7 with the built in color corrector on Windows Photo Editor. It's not available on 8 so I will have to buy lightroom because photoshop is too complex to quickly whip through and crop.I also have had Vaio computers before and consider them a superior product. The Samsung I had was better than this one, out of the box - however I wouldn't get Samsung again as Best Buy didn't want to hear it when it broke.So it's decent, I'm not going to send it back because I need it on a daily basis, but my advice shop around. A laptop should be able to handle Chrome and Photoshop without slowing down. It's not horrible but it's not the $600 Macbook that some of the other reviewers talked about.On the plus side, I got the pink one and it is really fun.", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great computer!!!", "Author": "Ursula Rogers", "ReviewID": "R2VT37WCGJNJ61", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a wonderful user-friendly computer, I love the soft pink color; Sony did an excellent job, a great computer to have.", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "love it!!", "Author": "mary", "ReviewID": "R1NRRXS4EQ179K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "wonderful laptop-love the lighted keypad-I like windows 8-but I also use classic shell--got the silver-but I wish I bought the pink-Great product!!", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "great!", "Author": "steph", "ReviewID": "RE8I7OUFHDX4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got 2 day shipping it arrived on time and was worth the wait. the sound works awesome ! the mouse pad is amazing for fast zoom. color is great looks beautiful key pad is amazing I love it!! you will be happy with ur purchase!", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Good Laptop!", "Author": "Naulee", "ReviewID": "R3NTVN5RU2RPZN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop for myself for school and college next year.The resolution is so amazing, and the speakers are crystal clearIt's so pretty, and its fast! I love the backlight keyboard for working in the dark.The rapid wake is so awesome, close the laptop lid and it goes to sleep, open it back up and it loads up everything in a matter of seconds!The 15.5 inch is perfect, it's not too big and its not too small (hence includes the numeric keypad).I'm also into gaming a bit, (not like super intense hardcore gaming where the fps has to be at least 30) but this laptop gets done with what I want it to.An added bonus is the Imagination Studio, I love editing videos together and my desktop has gotten so old (2004) and lost so much space, that it hasn't been able to get the job done, with Sony Vegas I can do all that.Now the cons:The webcam.... is god awful, they advertise HD but its max output is 1MP, so you're better off hooking up a different webcamThe touchpad is also really sensitive and hard to get used to, especially with Windows 8 and that new formatMy laptop came with part of the plastic backing loose and very fragile looking so I'm hoping a quick fix with super glue will help that EDIT: Nope it snapped back into place!So yeah, there aren't really many that issues with it all! I'm not really into Windows 8, but I figured I'd have to learn it eventually, and yeah, it's definitely going to take me a while. I already have a webcam to my desktop so I'm going to see how well that looks. Also I'm buying a mouse because in general, laptop touch pads and I just dont really agree, and just so you know USB mice work just fine if you don't want to splurge on a high priced wireless one. Also if you look on the internet and even Amazon says the battery life is 2.75 hours, don't worry, there are plenty of ways to adjust it, you're more likely to have 3-4 hours of straight web surfing, as for me I'm the type to keep my laptop plugged in for a majority of the time. Fingers crossed it lasts through the next 4 years of college!EDIT MARCH 6, 2013:So that little plastic piece I was talking about, yeah it broke. I glued it and taped it, oh well.Some small cosmetic scratches have also appeared, so I'm looking for a skin cover tooAlso about a month ago, my Windows did an update and had to restart when it got back to the login screen everything froze up, but not exactly, just that I couldn't get my keyboard to work (it wasn't connecting) but the system still was because the clock would change. I eventually had to use the assist function on it (which was working with the keyboard) and do a refresh, which uninstalled all my programs. So safe to say now I'm backing up all installation files.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "On my third hard drive, Sony's service has been great", "Author": "josh justice", "ReviewID": "RVE964IWVEH51", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had to replace the hard drive twice since it was purchased.

Brought it for dad to use. He had a hard drive issue (or what I suspect to be a hard drive issue) after a few days of using the laptop. He was going to void the warranty and open the machine to get the drive replaced but I decided to look at it before he did that as a last resort. Turns out that the issue was common for VAIO machines with Win 8. I found a forum and someone gave troubleshooting steps to do some recovery measures and the problem was solved. If you experience any issues, I recommend that you check any tech forums for possible fixes before you decide to re-send the item to the shipper (if you do no reside in the US). Returning an item from Trinidad is a last resort as the returns process is a lot longer and expensive if you do not reside in the US.", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Best TV", "Author": "love amazon", "ReviewID": "RB1277RL5GSCA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like this tv was so glad that I bought it.

I do not know if this is a problem with the computer itself, or the app. It's a very pretty laptop and the lighted keys are very convenient at night.
