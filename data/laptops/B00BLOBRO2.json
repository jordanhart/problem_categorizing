Sometimes I'm on a site and it will minimize while I reading an article and I have stop and reopen. I'm constantly closlng the side screen that slides out automatically whether I click on it or not.

He was very happy with it until today, when he announced there is a problem with the speaker plug. When he unplugs a headset, the sound goes off all together, and the only way to get it working again is to reboot. The laptop has been sitting on a table and was not mishandled. Needless to say, he is pretty upset. I usually buy everything from amazon, but this time I bought it (he bought it) from walmart online. I'm sure we have no recourse and that's $330 down the drain. If anyone has any ideas to help, it would be greatly appreciated. I'm not a computer expert, so can't really comment on technical specifics, but before this incident, he was very happy with it. However, it did seem a bit flimsy in materials to me compared to the laptops I use at work.

I called HP, and they kindly offered to send a technician out to my house at the cost of $169.

Maybe because I have recently been more of a Mac user but everything about the Laptop is slow. It starts up slow, when you are creating a PowerPoint it stalls after every animation that you add, or effect put on a picture. It saves documents very slow it takes forever to load programs and get started.
