I was pleased except for the trackpad's issues-- it clicks around and selects stuff when I'm not even touching the computer, which can be really frustrating, especially when I'm trying to type. But I got a really great deal on this computer. However, my main complaint was my communication with the seller; they didn't respond to my questions promptly and I didn't like doing business with them. All in all I'm glad to have the computer, but am irritated at the sellers and not very happy about the issues with the trackpad that I didn't know about before I bought it.", "Date": "February 12, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004NEEDPC"}}
