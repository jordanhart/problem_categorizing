{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A lot to like in this gorgeous package but Asus support is not what I'm used to.", "Author": "Carlos", "ReviewID": "R1H9VAS5WFF4XJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "UPDATE 12/30/13:My review is the number one here so I feel obligated to post an update on my recent issues with the Taichi. I still love the machine, but Asus support is just too slow for me as you'll see on my story below and also on other reviews posted here.My Taichi had been overheating and I contacted support, I also told them about a screen crack I had due to a drop (Although the crack didn't appear until a month or two after the drop), the VIP Support exclusive to Taichi was friendly, professional, you name it, they were very good, however, things started to go south when they told me I had to ship the laptop back with my own box and paying my own shipping. You see, I come from a world of thinkpads where Lenovo ships me a box, overnight, with a prepaid overnight label and returns the laptop in the same way. I figured I would deal with it, but it was certainly inconvenient and disappointing for a business laptop. So I shipped the thing, praying that my package was good enough and didn't break the laptop even more and that it actually got there on time.Two weeks went by and I called in to see how things were going, they told me that the laptop was in repair and that I could check status online, etc. Then, I start checking online daily and notice that they have a message saying \"out of warranty waiting for customer response\". So I call in and they tell me that because I dropped it the laptop was out of warranty. That would all be fine however, before I sent it I had explained this to support and mentioned that I had the 1 year accidental damage protection and they said all was ok. Actually, they said that if not for that they would have sent a repair person to fix the laptop at my location, so how come now they forgot about all of this?The person I spoke to finally sent me a message, I should have received, letting me know of how much I had to pay to get it fixed, etc. but then later found my accidental warranty protection and told me all would be ok and that the laptop was already being repaired under that warranty.I'm still waiting for my laptop and although it hasn't been a month, like for some other people, this is already too long for me unfortunately, sometimes we fall in love with products because they are awesome and forget about reliability and support. I've dealt with thinkpad support many times over the years and they always delight me so for my next laptop I'm certainly going back to them. I will use the Taichi again when it comes back but if it breaks again or when its end of life comes, Asus won't see me back unless I start hearing raving reviews on the support side of things.UPDATED ON 6/9/2013This is a quick update of how things have evolved with the Taichi and I guess a final feeling after five months of use.-So far I haven't had any technical issues, the laptop is holding up very well. I even dropped it on its side once and it dented the housing but the screens didn't break and all works fine. Lucky break I think, this is not a laptop you should be dropping for sure!-I'm still getting 3 to 4 hours of battery life, so I haven't seen any degradation, which is great because I'm plugged in must of the time and I was afraid of battery degradation and no way to replace it. It's only five months though, we'll have to see.-I haven't seen many software upgrades from Asus, so what was buggy is still buggy. Like the palm rejection when using the pen, that's still there, I thought I had fixed it but nah, let's not kid ourselves, I have even stopped using my pen as much because it's just not as great of a experience as I'm used to. With that said, it's good to have the pen for signing things and what not, but I wouldn't recommend it for prolonged note taking.-My gripes with the Asus management software kind of went away, no more brightness issues, etc.All my other comments remain. I still love this laptop and don't think, even to this day, that there's anything better on the market for my needs. I hope they make a new version and keep improving on this design over the years, I would certainly love to buy a new one in another couple of years with longer battery life, better digitizer and a bigger SSD.Written in January 2013-------------I ordered my Taichi just two days ago from us.ncix and they supposedly only had one in stock which I luckily got overnighted to me. They were top notch with service and went the extra mile for me by shipping the item right away and even making a special trip to UPS to make sure I got it the next day as the pick up for that day had already been done.Now onto the Taichi.Pros-It's a great laptop all around, as long as you can live with some cons.-The keyboard is outstanding. I type a lot, all day long really, and the keyboard couldn't be better. And this coming from a Thinkpad owner of 10 years.-The touchpad is flawless, it works like a charm. I've never used a touchpad this good. I think it's pretty on par with mac touchpads, both on desktop and modern areas of Windows 8.-The build quality seems top notch and it's a gorgeous piece of hardware. Sure, you have to handle it with care because of the screen on the lid but overall it's a great build.-The 1080p Screens are top notch, the viewing angles are great, the colors look great, the text is sharp, a lot to like there.-UPDATED: The size is good for a laptop. Enough space for a great keyboard. I got good vision, but the screen on desktop is very useable at 1080p resolution. I don't have to zoom or anything, that said, I am young and have great vision. My IE browser seems to be auto zoomed in to 125% and thus I didn't have any issues reading web pages, however, after installing chrome I see that at 100% zoom you really can't browse the net, it's too small. The 125% zoom works well though, and everything in the desktop looks good.-The lid collects finger prints but you can't really see them from a far, so that's great because I was concerned about the laptop looking bad all the time due to finger prints.-It has a tablet on the lid! Sure, this is not your light and small ipad, but it works well, the colors are great and I do plan to replace my tablet and laptop with this one device.-Backlit keyboard. This is a huge pro for me and one of my requirements.-Comes with a good quality laptop sleeve, VGA and Ethernet adapter. That's $100 in accessories right there.-Comes with a one year accidental projection damage warranty, that's another added value/bonus there.Cons-UPDATED: Battery life. After some use, I seem to get from 3 to 4 hours of battery life while working full steam, typing, listening to music on headphones, backlit keyboard on, wifi and Bluetooth on and screen in medium brightness or so. If I dial things back a bit I can get past four hours just a bit, but I'm not sure how they got their five hour estimate though. For me this is fine as I'm plugged in most of the time and I may buy an external battery for long trips or meetings. Using it on and off as a tablet (and putting it to sleep when not in use with 2 second smart resume) I can get through most of the day.-UPDATED: I had some big issues with the digitizer pen at first, but I recalibrated the pen and touch input under windows settings and ever since it's working great (as intended). I no longer have lag when writing and the palm rejection is much better than before, although not quite all the way there in my opinion. Is it as good as Wacom? No, at least not in my opinion, but it does the job. One thing I'm not happy about is that it has no eraser head and the eraser button doesn't work on Microsoft's metro pdf app, there's no way to erase in this app with the pen, I can erease just fine with my Wacom pen on my thinkpad on that app. That said, the eraser button works fine on pdf annotator and onenote.-UPDATED: The Asus \"management\" software is a bit buggy, it seems to be fighting with Windows for authority. The main issue I see is with brightness, sometimes you set it to something and then it comes back to something else, this is due to power profiles not acting correctly I think. Also, auto brightness never ever gives you the top brightness even if you choose to get full brightness. The only way I got full brightness was by disabling auto brightness and then the brightness still changed some times on its own, mainly on tablet mode. Maybe there are two light sensors and the tablet one can't be disabled? Don't know. The screen switcher was a bit off at first but after some updates it seems to be doing fine.-UPDATED: The brightness is said to be a bit low, and it is mainly if you leave the auto brightness on, however, I find it adequate on both tablet and laptop mode, even on bright sunlight it seems adequate in my opinion.-The size for a tablet is a bit big, but if you want mainly a laptop and second a tablet then this is the best option in my opinion. I was expecting it to be lighter for some reason, as I have a HP TouchPad with a cover on and that package seems like two pounds to me, so you would think another .75 pounds wouldn't be so much, but it feels a bit heavy, that said I can live with it.-I had read on some tech sites that using a tablet with 16:9 aspect ration on portrait was a bit ridiculous, and you know what, it kind of feels weird. I guess it's something to get used to, but don't expect it to feel natural right off the bat.Subjective Items-UPDATED: No touch screen in laptop mode. To me this is a pro as the laptop screen doesn't have finger prints and it's matt which I love, I don't think I could stand a glossy screen for work all day. Also, the touchpad works so great that you may not miss touch so much in laptop mode. I can easily pinch to zoom, scroll, pull up charms, etc., all from the touchpad. You will want to touch the screen sometimes, specially after spending some time using the touch screen on the lid, but I'm happy with the way it is, another touch screen would've added more weight and a glossy screen in the front and that would've been a big issue for me.-The audio is a bit low for my taste. I had read that the audio was pretty loud, but I wouldn't consider it loud, I would consider it adequate but that's about it. I was expecting a bit more bang. That said, I listen to a lot of loud music and may be a bit deft already, so your mileage may vary.-This vs the surface pro? I went with this one because for just another $150 (vs surface with cover), I get a backlit keyboard, two screens and an adjustable screen that I can easily use in my lap, bed, couch, anywhere at the craziest angles, which I tend to do. The surface wouldn't work for me in the same way and I would've had to adjust. That said, I wanted mainly a great laptop with a nice enough tablet. I think the surface pro is a good tablet (not great due to low battery life too)and an OK laptop.-UPDATED: The keyboard lacks media buttons for pause/play/next track, etc. Those are useful while playing music. It also lacks the new windows keys that come with some keyboards for charms, search, etc. That said, it's a small keyboard and they couldn't have put everything in there. The other thing is that the function keys, F1 to F12, are primary vs the other items like brightness and volume. I prefer it the other way, but again this is subjective. I did fine a tool called KeyTweak which allows you to remap your keyboard keys however you want, and I have changed F10 through F12 for media buttons, so that problem is solved!**Lastly, this is a warning. The 128gb version, which is the one I have, only comes with 63gb of available space out of the box. This is crazy! I was expecting more like 90gb after windows, etc., but Asus has a 20gb recovery partition and a 4gb OEM partition in there, so that's pretty substantial and I plan to kill at least the recovery partition and get my space back**So the final verdict.I love it so far. Sure it has some drawbacks, but there's no perfect hybrid out there right now. I was planning to wait for second generation models but come on, life's too short to be waiting and waiting, I've been waiting long enough and this is 90% what I wanted so I'll take it and enjoy it. The battery life is the biggest limitation/con in my opinion, but I plan to buy an external battery of some sort to have around for emergencies or long meetings/seminars.To me this laptop is just AWESOME and I wouldn't buy anything else on the market over this for my own needs.", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "From a professional, this is my favorite pc ever.", "Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "R1PL2HZNAQPPC1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would like to say that there are some misconseptions about this laptop and some very skewed reviews that I have read.Here is my take on the laptop.First, I have had the previous laptops before this and they pale in comparison to the Taichi.The Samsung ATIV PC Pro 700t. (Horrible keyboard)The Samsung Series 9 late 2012 edition. (second favorite ultrabook)Lenovo Twist, Lenovo Carbon x1, HP Spectre 14 with Ivy bridge(late 2012)(Heavy), The yoga (I call it the horrible bouncing screen), the ASUS Zenbook UX31A (Excellent), and my media laptop the HP ENVY 17 3d (Ivy bridge) spec'ed out.Why am I telling you this?I have come to find out that the laptops with the touchscreen right in front of the keyboard has become an unused option for myself, especially when you have a good windows 8 compatible touchpad.  The new touchpads have all the screen moves with no arm movement to reach out to the screen, and once you learn to use the efficiency of the shortcuts there is no real reason to take the time to reach up to the screen. (I did less and less over time.)  I did however want the touchscreen tablet version for the new OS and the desire for the touchscreen but not in the way that it is presented behind a keyboard.  The touchpad is great for taking notes, touchscreen games, Drawing, and just plain fun to use with the windows 8 fluent OS.  I really do love it.  For those of you not liking the windows 8 yet, give it time.  I have come to love it for its efficiency and ability to go PC, Tablet, Phone.  With the learning curve mostly past me, there is nothing else that compares in my opinion.  I would think that everyone would feel the same way once they put the time in and get past the learning curve of the new Awesome OS.  I certain would think so at least.This leading me to why I love the Taichi so much.  I have a great ASUS Zenbook with a great touch pad and I blow through everything windows 8 style and never even think about wanting to have to reach up to the screen.  There is no reason I have to do so.  I am writing Documents, Surfing the web, Productivity, anything keyboard related I really have no need for the screen to be a touch screen in front of me.  Now, when I am done and I have a craving for a touchscreen or I just want consumption with a touchscreen I close the lid and Voila, a tablet for bedtime, table, anywhere.  I play with the stylus (try that upright with a keyboard in front of you.)  I swipe through the games, web, and I love to draw (have you tried the Fresh Paint app by the way).  The awesome stylus the Taichi comes with is the perfect tool for the tablet.When I need to go back to writing emails etc...  I open the lid and instantly have my awesome Zenbook back in front of me to do so.My next desire in a laptop cross over would be to prop the tablet up at just the right angle to watch a movie without the keyboard in front of me.  Taichi does just this.Turn the laptop around hit the outside screen switch and I have a tablet at the angle I want and can watch movies or still just use the tablet as it was meant to be used.I hope this is making sense to some of you.To summarize, I don't want a touchscreen when typing and doing emails and regular laptop functions.  I do want a tablet when I can touch it easily, write, swipe, and draw properly.  I also want the ability to look at the tablet at my preferred angle for plain viewing.  That is turn it around and there is the tablet. (note; with the bottom still on the bottom, unlike the lenovo yoga with the keys down on the table, yikes!)This is another reason why I love the Taichi.It is the perfect tablet for me and I have not covered the dual screen (My kid loves this part).  The ability to have a movie playing on the back side while I am working at the table or sofa is a very cool thing for my 3 year old. I also can do some teaching with him like this as well. He also sits and watches a show sometimes while I work.  OK, OK, that is not the top of everyone's list, but who cares, that part is still cool.Everything else about the tablet is a 10.  The quality, the touchpad, the three level backlit keyboard, the FULL HD SCREENS!  The screens are VERY solid and I have no concern after using them that there will ever be an issue of two screens being on the lid.  It is solid.  I spent the 180 bucks for ADP coverage of course but I don't think it will be the screens that I would have to use it on.This is the number one tablet in my eyes.I hope this helps some people in making the right choice for their new Laptop crossover.", "Date": "January 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "GIve It Some Time", "Author": "Tech Man", "ReviewID": "RI7K8I810JTHS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After all the reviews I had read about the Taichi I was very hesitant; but I was compelled by the form factor. So when I found out that it was available at my local FRYS I went to their to take a look and I was pleased with the aesthetic and great build quality, so I purchased the I7 with 256 GB.  These are hard to come by and I didn't want it to get away from.  Asus does a great job in packaging the right materials most of which you need, the ballistic nylon case, the stylus, the USB dongles and pouch, cleaning cloth and Velcro strapping for the cables...great stuff.When I took it home to set up it was easy and had no issues then had MS store techs do their PC tune up for $99 and the computer was cleaned out of all the bloatware and its just like getting a PC at the MS store with their Microsoft signature...it blazes now. OFFICE 2013 is great and works well with this form factor of a PC laptop, the screens are amazing both the matte finish and the tablet, you have to adjust the settings in the charm bar to stop having the system dim the display as I have read the reviews that pointed a dim display even with it being charged.As for battery life its not that bad, 4-5 hours is good for me plus for what I use it for I can get up 6-7 hours, I didn't buy this to stream on line or gaming without the battery, this reason is a whole new PC itself, like a desktop but I use it more for email, and some web surfing, and fact finding, Sky Drive and Dropbox MS OFFICE, and travel.Just give it some time, I think this the best form factor or \"hybrid\" PC laptop out their now, yes there is the Yoga and the Twist made from Lenovo and I have the twist but it doesn't compare to this, as for the Yoga I don't like the fact that the keyboard face down when in the tablet mode, this one the keyboard is not laying on your lap. And for now this is the only form factor that is out their that works the best, until the Lenovo Helix and the HP Revolve comes out, outside of that I am not sure whats out in the horizon, but I am sure ASUS will have an improved Taichi or a different named PC that has dual touch screens.  I can live with one touch screen for now, the matte screen again is awesome..The design is awesome and I am liking this more and more...again buy and give it some time and you wont regret it...", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great ultra-hybrid to combine your work and play worlds!", "Author": "Sean", "ReviewID": "R3LM20VQ6TGXQ2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the TaiChi for a couple days now and have to say it is everything I was looking for in an ultra-hybrid and am very satisfied with my purchase. I am the demographic that this form factor appeals to the most as I work for a large corporation, travel quite a bit, give presentations often, and like to play games at times. My goal with the TaiChi is to replace my HP EliteBook and my Asus EP121 tablet plus accessories when I travel. I won\u2019t go into specifics on the features as it has been covered very well by other reviewers but what is really nice for me is the power this device has, and the ability to put it into tablet mode and angle the screen for the perfect profile to use a touch device.I am also planning on getting a USB with \u201cWindows to Go\u201d so I can have the best of both my work and play worlds. The idea is that I can leave my work PC behind and still have access to corporate resources when I need to without having to have my personal machine managed by corporate IT. This way they can be assured that I am not a danger to the network and I don\u2019t have to have VPN and the bloat of other IT processes slowing down my user experience. If you are thinking about going this route, make sure the USB you purchase is certified for Windows to Go, I will update when I have it all running.The duel screens work very well and PowerPoint presentation mode works as you would expect with the two screens. The TaiChi comes with a micro HDMI to VGA adapter so I am good there, but I would also recommend getting a micro HDMI cable or adapter as well if you are giving a lot of presentations and need to be able to connect to various setups.The only nitpicks I see to this experience has been:1. Battery life \u2013 While it is not the same as my Kindle HD Fire I also understand that I have an Intel i7 processor and can run any PC software I own. I travel with my Kindle so it is not a big deal for me on airplanes and I am fine for power at work and hotels. I of course always want it to last longer!2. Windows logo \u2013 I wish there was an option to turn down the brightness of the Windows logo that also acts as the home button for Windows 8. When I watch a movie in a darker room, or potentially in a darkened aircraft it is annoying as it can be right in my face with the unit lid screen facing me. It should dim it like the screen based on the ambient light.3. Screen cleaning \u2013 I am always wiping down my screen but understand that it is a touch device for oily handed creatures.4. Windows shortcut keys for moving apps between monitors does not seem to work, but maybe it is me.Overall I would recommend this device for anyone that does a lot of travel and has to bring a lot of junk to support both your work and play worlds!", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Update Drivers & Re-partition for 30+GB of usable space", "Author": "Gabriel Franco", "ReviewID": "R23NUES45J1WT2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went through most of the competition when selecting a hybrid and selected the Taichi as meeting all of my needs.  It has been more than a month and I am happy with my choice. Most of what can be said has been said by other reviewers, but I have one essential suggestion to add.Initially the Taichi infuriated me to no end with quirks and bugs such as the screen not flipping properly when opening the lid and the touchscreen and touchpad not recognizing some essential windows 8 gestures. It was bad enough that I considered returning the computer and waiting for the Asus transformer book, however a curious thing happened. While trying to delete the restore partition and reclaim disk space I completely borked the SSD partitions forcing me to re-install windows 8 with a retail Windows 8 Disc and reload the drivers.  I downloaded all of the latest drivers from support.asus (Use the support address because the Taichi product page support link wont have the drivers) and ever since everything works flawlessly.  This means that the Taichi is shipping with faulty outdated drivers. A complete reformat should not be necessary, but be sure to download all of the drivers and install them over the currently installed drivers.NOTE: On my Taichi without reformatting the SSD it would have been impossible to increase the size of my C partition because of an immovable 4GB system partition sitting between it and the recovery partition.  If you can get around that, you'll end up with 117GB of usable space.The Taichi isn't perfect (proprietary SSD interface, No built in SD reader, no inside touch), but I felt it worthy of 5 stars because there is nothing in the market I would trade it for.", "Date": "March 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great concept but horrible, buggy, and flawed execution with defective digitizer", "Author":

how the Taichi could improve my productivity but after having to return 2 faulty Taichi laptops I am convinced that Asus rushed this product to market before they got their technology right.This is supposed to be a productivity tool but instead it has been a black hole of wasted time. I spent hours setting up the first Taichi I received just the way I liked it with all the settings and Office applications I needed. Only to find out all the bugs and defects that Asus failed to address before shipping this product.Imagine trying to concentrate on a meeting when your Taichi on Tablet mode is registering touch input that you did NOT initiate. So as you are having your meeting the Taichi is busy launching your applications, closing them, selecting various random parts of the screen and generally making the tablet most unusable. Good luck using a stylus with all this going on with a defective digitizer! And when I tried to actually use the mirror feature it bombed and again wasted time and was actually an embarrassment as I was fiddling with my laptop when trying to show something to a client when I could have just turned the laptop around.The first Taichi was returned due to the faulty digitizer but the second one in addition to having the problems with the touch screen/digitizer also has a defective battery. It sometimes refuses to charge the battery above 79% or some other arbitrary % figure. Other times no matter how much the laptop is used, the charge is always some arbitrary % and never changhes only to have the power cut off completely while the Taichi is being used. So the second Taichi I bought is even worse than the first.What makes the situation even worse is the ineffective Asus Taichi support. They call it VIP support but that is a joke and there is nothing VIP about it. Some times hold times are 30+ minutes. All their \"solutions\" come down to you reinstalling windows, resetting windows, and when they fail help solve the problem they want you to ship your brand new Taichi to them with your data and applications and pray that they will fix and send your Taichi back without trying to access any of your personal data on the laptop. When I found a problem with one of their chipset drivers not updating the chipset version installed, they refused to help me solve the problem other than suggesting wiping the laptop clean or sending the laptop to them.I would never send a defective new laptop only days old to the manufacturer for repair. They can sit on the laptop and you could end up with a laptop with the same problems but you no longer have the benefit of the 30 day return window. If you buy a Taichi and it is defective, just return it to Amazon for a refund and don't bother wasting hours of your time with Asus support.After two defective Taichis, no more for me.I am waiting for the ThinkPad Helix. Hopefully it is a solidly built business laptop that works with a solid digitizer and touch screen. I have no more time to waste on a laptop that is more of a gimmick than a serious productivity tool.UPDATE 6/6/2013: With Intel's 4th generation chip Haswell just released it does not make sense for me to purchase the Think pad Helix anymore. I am likely going to instead purchase the Sony Vaio Duo 13 that is coming out this weekend. Hopefully it is a solid laptop with a functional digitizer.", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Idea, poorly executed and supported", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1NLMOB2Q757DV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ok, an Update...It's 8/30/13... I just got another RMA from ASUS to send back the TAICHI 21 with yet another failure.  This time another battery failure -- out of the blue.  I had begun to just shut down the unit after use due to uncertainty about the battery life and use.  Well, last Tuesday I shut it down with at least 90% battery power remaining.  Wednesday, it wont boot or charge... AGAIN!?.  Looks like another defective battery. This will be event #5.  I keep it only because it FAILED after the 30 day warranty and I've sunk over $1500 in it.  What a worthless p***** *f s***!Overjoyed when I got it back in Feburary.  That joy was short lived when I sent it in for repair when it wouldn't re-charge after less than one month.  Defective battery.  RMA #2 less than a month later - wont charge.  I sent it in, got it back TWO WEEKS LATER, dead tablet display -- not the same problem I sent it in for... broken during repair, also, defective charger (RMA cause).  I talked to ASUS support, who after about 20 min of unsuccessful driver installations, etc., recommended that I \"refresh\" it -- which in geek speak means wipe it to factory settings. This so that he may determine if the problem was software or hardware -- at which point I would need to RMA it ONE MORE TIME.  Now the This machine does not have a DVD drive... some software requires personal interaction with the vendor and a long time to port data images.  Yet I would have to wipe it to satisfy a troubleshooting step???VERY POOR ..My son had one and has had power supply problems with it as well. That's two for two!Dont buy this thing... it looks good, but is a brick headache...", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dream Machine", "Author": "Rudy James Jr.", "ReviewID": "RVLH7HA7D2UT6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the Taichi for 2 days now and it is a laptop / tablet that meets all the needs I have been looking for.Out of the box it did several updates and after completing them the machine showed no problems that some others have noted.Starting from the beginning you will first notice the packaging. Asus made certain you felt like you were getting a quality machine for the money you spent. Everything included is top of the line and even the warranty that came with the unit has something extra The one year covers even drops spills and power surges. I own several computers lap tops and even tablet computers none offered that kind of coverage. You also get the needed VGA and RJ45 adaptors included.When you see the unit and hold it in your hands you will be amazed at the build quality of the unit. The look with the glass top and the thinness is something you have to see and hold to understand the quality of the unit. It is not as light as an ipad and it is much more machine then an ipad even an ipad 128 gig can not touch this machine.The 11.6 inch screens is truly great to look at by going with this size you do not feel you have an over priced netbook or a lap killing 17 inch lap top. Because of the width you get to enjoy a very much less cramped keyboard, which is so nicely back lit typing in the dark is so great and easy to do.On to the great debate about the inner screen not being touch. Everyone is saying this is a mistake I really do not need a touch screen here. With the great keyboard and the excellent track pad I have not reached up to try and use the inner screen as a touch screen. When I see my self working in excel or word even I do not see my self trying to work it with a touch screen at all. So why have the touch at all? For me I like the metro or the touch side when I am taking notes in One Note I also use it when watching some media and play good touch controlled games.Why the laptop use? I like to use this on my lap which you can not do with the Surface Pro I also have the type with the separate keyboard (Acer W500 ) This became top heavy and again there was no laptop use of that unit. I looked at this machine and the Sony Duo 11 and it was very close trying to pick which is right for me the final factor that made me pick this is that I just liked the look of the Tia Chi soo much more. Granted the Sony does have a better set of ports on it then this unit has and it also comes with 2 more gigs of memory. I do not see myself taxing the 4gig this comes with I do not do any drawing.The machine is very responsive and does not get to hot to handle. The screen brightness is great even if it is not 400 nits. The matt screen is also another benefit. I was watching a movie while in in a fast food place (really not good for you). I started by using the top or back screen the touch one. The Avengers looked great on it. After eating I flipped the  movie onto the matt screen because the lights were reflecting off the screen once I did that wow it look great again. So here you have a machine that you can watch media on and pick the best screen for where you are to watch it.The unit powers up in under 10 seconds if you are on the matt screen and you close the lid you flip to the glossy screen in about 4 to 5 seconds. You can even set it to use the back (glossy) screen with the lid still open as a kind of stand for the touch screen.Right now I find the unit to be everything I have been looking for and then some. Is it perfect no it is not I would love to see a bigger SSD or at least an user upgradeable ssd  and maybe an sd slot would be nice but not sure how much I would use it and I am sure we would all love to have a longer battery life on it. But I knew all these things going in before buying it and I was ok with it.If you do buy this unit just know that you will blow the minds of the average PC person showing my friends this unit and the dual screen they had a wow look on their face they wanted to know where I got it and how much it was and none of them said I paid to much. Over the  next few days I will continue to install and work with some aps and games and programs and see how it holds up. I have already installed ITunes Office 2007 for programs Netflix, ABC, CW, Pulse for apps. I will update this review as I do more with this machine right now I can say if you are thinking about it BUY IT.First Update 2/11/2013I have added office 2013 to my Tai Chi and removed Office 2007. It seems like the scaling on office 2013 ia made to better fit the Tablet running at HD level resolution. The Tai Chi has the same problem just about all the 1920 X 1024 displays has when it comes to the desk top. Everything is on the tiny side even at the default 125% viewing. Office 2013 seems to take that into account and allows you to better adjust your viewing.", "Date": "February 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wacom Pen", "Author": "LO KUEI-YANG", "ReviewID": "R4IFZOS966CK6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't have to go through each detail of this product because others did.What I want to add on is the misunderstanding of Wacom Pen of Taichi from most of the reviewers.At first, I found the two buttons on the pen are not functional until I used it with Microsoft Office 2013 OneNote.The first button on the pen is \"Lasso Select\" and the other one is the Erasor.So it's a perfect combination.I hope people who have knowledge can review it correctly.BTW, I've delete all partitions of the default Taichi HD and reinstall it through Boot by USB and make it the Windows 8 Enterprise in ASUS Taichi with all drivers functional!!I'm now testing its WiDi which is Wireless Display feature.Great!", "Date": "January 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "After 3 Weeks of Use", "Author": "Yehia", "ReviewID": "R3QDW9KDWRQO8V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got my Taichi 3 weeks ago and thus became the 1st proud Egyptian owner of it! I wrote a review then but lost it due to internet connection so I didn't feel like writing it again. Then today I found a review on Gizmodo that just got me really angry. Those so-called experts' reviews spend only a few hour with a device and come up with some really horrible reviews depending on their subjective predetermined opinion more than anything! So here's my review:In general I strongly agree with Carlos on his review so I'll try to say the pros and cons which aren't in his review, rest of the pros and cons can be found in his review here: (http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H9VAS5WFF4XJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN;=B009F1IHZK&nodeID;=541966&store;=pc)Pros:- It is the lightest and thinnest convertible laptop in the market right now, even though it has an additional screen.- The build quality is also the best. This thing is very solid and there's no moving parts like twisting screens or weird frames as in Dell XPS 12. So you don't have to worry about breaking something.- The mouse pad is big, it's really nice, gestures work perfectly on it. The keyboard is just a pleasure to type on!- Even though it has 2 screen. Connecting my screen to the HDMI port was very easy, I just put the cable in, the screen was coping the inner screen, so I pulled the charm bar and from Devices I choose Extend Display and there it is. Once I close the laptop, it switches to the outer screen while maintaining the extended Desktop, if I want to to some drawings while seeing what I draw on the big screen, just as simple, I go back to duplicating display.- After adjusting pen sensitivity a little, the pen is so amazing. 3 of my friends are into arts and one of them do it for living and after testing the pen they all wish to have a device like this instead of their usual Wacom tablets.- You will not find yourself reaching for the inner screen to touch it. Forget about all those reviews and take it from someone who actually used the thing for more than a day. Reaching for the inner screen is a very unnatural move, and with the very good mouse pad, you will not find yourself doing it.There are some additional pros, as said, Carlos did a good job at stating them, and since I don't have a very good memory you can ask me about exact details you'd like to know.Cons:- If you have both screen on. And you're thinking about doing some work while your kid plays a game on the other side. Forget it. This isn't possible. It is a single laptop with a single mouse pointer. Every time your kid touches the outer screen your mouse will move to his screen and you have to drag it back into your screen. The two screens simply work like any extended display, if you used a system with 2 screens before you'll know how this works.- The bezel around the inner screen is as big as it is around the outer screen. It's kinda big on the side and looks unusual for laptop screens.- Battery life, 3 hours of heavy use. My heavy is is pretty heavy.- You'll find it hard to use it in tablet mode while it's in landscape position. The weight distribution will be bad due to the size of the laptop so you'll find it hard to hold with one hand, if you're holding it with both your hands then you'll feel its light. As for holding it in portrait position, it can be done using one hand -I'm not that strong, actually, I'm not strong at all =P-Um, I can't think of any other cons to add right now. If I remembered any later I'll add them to the review. Again, if you have any questions please let me know in the comments.", "Date": "February 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "You can do it all with the Taichi", "Author": "Lightfoot \"AGB\"", "ReviewID": "R2MO4PAF66G4E4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this DH71 11.6 inch model for about 3 or 4 months now. 5 stars overall because it is awesome, you can do it all with this machine (work, play, media, easily connect to multiple 24\" external monitors or your TV). And I really like this baby. I use it for work (engineer) and for play at home. You need to purchase the Taichi \"suit\" cover in order to get the full functionality out of this thing. The \"Taichi suit\" protects your investment, supports it at 2 different angles in tablet mode, and supports it at one angle in laptop mode. Definitely get the suit, and learn how to use it. It works very well.I didn't experience all of the driver problems that others had complained about in past reviews (especially in early 2013), but I didn't buy this baby until late summer, so maybe Asus had all the kinks worked out by then. That said I did resolve some issues...Tips on how to be successful with the Asus Taichi:- First of all, get the i7 processor. I have no experience with the i5 processor, but why settle for less than i7? Be safe. Go for the i7.- Be careful about downloading win 8.1... I don't think the drivers are ready for it, so it screwed up my graphics and other things. Just stick with win 8 for some time until you are positive that Taichi is ready for 8.1. I had to do a system refresh and reinstall everything just to get back to win 8. Maybe a restore would have worked. Just be careful about upgrading to win 8.1.- Outside screen cracked... Like I said I was careless. I tossed it around the car. I was using the flimsy sleeve without any other kind of protection. I stacked it with other things in my car. Bad move. Somewhere along the way, I noticed a crack along the corner of the screen. Huge bummer. But luckily the basic \"accidental damage insurance protection\" covered the cost of repairs ($110). So after hat experience I purchased the Taichi \"suit\" for $30 on the Microsoft store. Get it. Like I said, get the suit. You need the suit to protect this device.- Multiple external monitors (for work)... This thing is fast and powerful. I use it with (2) 24\" external monitors at work and it is awesome. I use the mini VGA adaptor that comes with it to connect to one monitor. I use a USB-HDMI graphics adaptor that I bought from Best Buy for the other monitor. I really like using windows 8 at work with multiple monitors, and this machine is the heart of my operation. I run multiple applications and regularly plug into and unplug from multiple monitors. It took a few tries to figure it out, but now it works every time. When I get to work I just plug in each monitor (one with mini VGA on left side and one with USB-HDMI graphics adaptor on right side), swipe in from the right side, click devices, second screen, extend... voila, I am up and running every day. To unplug from multiple monitors, don't worry, just unplug and be free. Enjoy the light weight and versatile Taichi in your meetings and travels!- Using in laptop mode... this is actually a non-issue. In laptop mode, the touchpad works great. You don't need a touch screen in laptop mode. Learn to use the touchpad!- Touchpad... Learn to use the touchpad like I said. It is powerful like a Mac touchpad. You can do things with 2 fingers, 3 fingers, and basically the same wipe gestures that you can use on the touchscreen in the tablet mode. You can use those same gestures on the touchpad in the laptop mode. You will become very efficient once you adopt the touchpad gestures.- Screen brightness auto-adjust... I had some problems with the screen or ambient light sensor so I disabled the auto-adjust of screen brightness. Again this is no something I care about. I am fine with manual screen brightness. That said, the keyboard backlight works very nicely and if you haven't used keyboard backlight before, you are in for a treat. It is the only way to see the keyboard at night, if you are someone like me who has to look at the keyboard every now and again as you type...- Protect it, purchase the \"Taichi suit\" and use it as a tent! This machine is solid, if you protect. I was very careless with it at first. I didn't have a good cover for it. The flimsy sleeve that comes with it, doesn't provide much protection. You need to buy the \"Suit\" for somewhat better protection. I still wish I could find some more rugged protection cases for when I use this at work in the field. The suit is a good investment for $30-40. Get it.- Drive space... you only have 256 GB of drive space, so you need to be selective. No problem. Use a server, or work on the cloud and be careful as to which folders you sync on your machine. Just use cloud services for your data. These sold state machines simply do not have the capacity to store a billion songs, files, and photos. You need to use office 360, dropbox, google drive, or one of those things. And put your media somewhere on a cloud as well. It is safer on the cloud anyway. You could break this machine tomorrow. SO you want to have your important stuff stored somewhere else.- Win 8... Learn how to use win 8. I think some people are leaving bad reviews for this machine simply because they don't like win 8. It is better than win 7. WIn 8 is like win 7, but with metro widget mode as well. You just touch the win key to switch between win 7 and win 8. Ok, I am sorry the start icon is gone in the corner of the desktop display. But you can easily find and learn the win key shortcuts. For example \"win x\" will bring up a menu that includes control panel. To turn off your machine just go with ctrl+alt+delete and turn I off there. No big deal folks!- Desktop Mode vs Metro mode... You can choose the default in your browser, so for instance you may want to run IE in metro mode and use that browser in the win 8 metro mode... the icons and so forth are bigger and easier to navigate with your finger. But I also ue IE for searching stuff in laptop mode. For browsing on chrome, I run chrome in desktop mode. How to change? Just click on internet options or options in chrome, and right there at the top there is an option to switch to window 8 metro mode or desktop mode.- Play with settings... You can always play with settings and notifications to customize your machine. For example I use an outlook exchange service, so I was getting double notifications - one from outlook, and one from the email app, every time an email hit my inbox. I disabled the notifications in the email app and that fixed it. You can also adjust sound settings. In desktop mode it is a lot like win 7 to adjust settings. In win 8 mode you just swipe in from the right and settings is always right there a swipe away...- Get a USB hub... you don't need 3 USB ports on a laptop. Just get a USB hub and you can expand your number of USB connections as needed. I use this for my flash drive, etc. at work. Otherwise 2 USB ports is fine.This is a well designed machine. I am not a super hero with computers. This machine has made me quicker. It is much lighter than my old Asus clunker. That said, I hope this thing lasts for at least 2 more years. I really this baby! The only thing is I wish maybe the screen was a tad bigger. Maybe I should have gotten the bigger, 13 inch screen. The 11.6 inch screen looks tiny at work scrunched in between my two 24\" external monitors... But on the other hand, the 11.6\" model is nice and small and lightweight in the field and on the go. 11.6 is probably nicer in tablet mode. 13\" would be better at work.", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Ultrabook/Tablet Combo", "Author": "Arthur", "ReviewID": "RT0DMR1Y7UV9R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am currently typing this review on my brand new Asus Taichi. I went with the 11 inch core i7 256 gig ssd model.I did lots of research before my purchase. I am a mechanical engineering student, and I wanted a portable laptop that could run all my engineering software. My friend bought the Surface Pro, and raved about it. I went to a Best Buy, and tested it myself. It worked pretty well, and I left impressed. I especially liked the type cover and digitizer. I also tested the Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga 13 13.3-Inch Convertible Touchscreen Ultrabook (Gray), and the Dell XPS 12 that flips around on the hinge. I stumbled upon the Asus Taichi on CNET one day, and I was impressed. I immediately read all the reviews I could find. Some people loved it, others had bad experiences with returns and defects. I couldn't find the Taichi in stores anywhere, so I wasn't able to test it before buying. After much thought (and a $100 gift card for Amazon), I decided to take a chance and go with the Taichi.Unpacking the Taichi is like Christmas day. The box is cool, and all sorts of goodies are included. The pen includes a battery, and the VGA and ethernet dongles in a little carrying pouch. A handy carrying case, warranty card, instruction manual, and cable ties are also in the box.My first impression was to be shocked at how thin and light this computer really is. Coming from a three year old HP, this was night and day different. The setup process took about ten minutes, and then I went to the asus support website to download all the new drivers. My trackpad worked great until I installed the updated driver. The the gestures stopped working. I reinstalled the old driver and it worked again. Go figure. After that, I installed Creo Pro 2.0 (CAD software), as well as MatLAB. Both work like a charm. Everything is smooth, and there is no lag whatsoever with multiple programs running. People complain about the lack of apps in the Windows store, but I was able to find One Note, Twitter, the Wall Street Journal, Skype, and Dropbox. These are really the only apps I use anyway.The next feature I tested is by far the best. I closed the lid, and BAM, it's a tablet. It is a little heavier than my old Acer Iconia Tab, but not too bad. However, this tablet blows all other tablets away. I can run my Windows apps, I can use my digitizer to take notes and draw, and oh yeah, I can run any Windows program I want. The touch screen is great. I haven't really used the dual screen presentation mode, and I don't see when I would need to do that. I wanted the Taichi to use as a laptop when I needed it, and a tablet when I wanted one. This does that perfectly.The pen input works great on One Note. Writing is smooth with no lag, and the calibration seems spot on. Asus includes a note taking app, but I liked One Note better.I haven't done any drawing and I don't plan on doing very much in the future. I wanted the digitizer to take notes during class, and so far it fits that need perfectly. The pen is also solidly built, and easy to hold. I wish it was a little bit longer for more comfortable writing, but I can't complain too much. There is no place to keep the pen on the laptop, but the carrying case does have a little slot for it. I carry the Taichi around in the case anyway, so this works for me.ProsFast - No lag when switching between apps or running multiple demanding programsLight and Thin - Sometimes I forget it's even in my backpackTouchscreen - Tablet mode works great, very responsiveDigitizer - Pen works great, One Note is freeBluetooth - I can connect my Galaxy S4 to it to transfer files or play music through the speakersScreens - Super high definition, very clearConsBattery - Could last longer. The charger is pretty light and small though so it's not a big dealDrivers - You must update before really using this machine, it really improves performanceMini Ports - Although dongles are included, I wouldn't mind a full size HDMI on hereScaling - Text on screen is small, and Chrome requires zoom for me to view comfortablyHeat - The bottom can get warm, and the area by the hinge above the keyboard gets HOTTo summarize, this is a great machine. I wish it had the Haswell chips inside, but otherwise I would highly recommend the Taichi. I never find myself reaching up to touch the inside screen, so this is not a flaw to me. I also just purchased the Chromium TV thing from Google, and I hope to eventually use that instead of WiDi. Anyone looking for a fast, premium looking and feeling ultrabook with a digitizer should definitely consider the Taichi.", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Program on the inside, Play on the outside", "Author": "Nelxon \"artist, animator, programmer, game de...", "ReviewID": "RCCLYVSLRC6XM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After months of researching and reading comments, I decided to go with ASUS Taichi 21-DH71.I've had my Tachi for a little over a month now and it is perfect for me because I'm a programmer-artist-animator-game developer.First off, this is replacing my Sony Vaio Laptop and Wacom Cintiq 12 combination I used to carry everywhere - All of those wires and setup just to start work was a nightmare. The Cintiq is nice if you don't need it to be really portable.How do I use My Tachi?For Programming:  I open it and use it just like a laptop - Note: the touchpad is awesome.For Drawing & Animating:  I close it and use it like a Cintiq; however I did buy a numpad for keyboard shortcuts and I lowered the screen resolution to make it feel more like my previous Cintiq.Note: Pressure sensitivity doesn't work in all applications - but it works for the ones I use most. For game development:  Program on the inside, Play on the outside. I love that it eliminates the extra step of deploying to other devices for gameplay and UI testing.

When I first got it I had some problems with the trackpad (as in it wouldn't respond to any gestures after resume from sleep mode) but this was fixed by an update from the asus site. I know the 128G is a concern for some people (especially since it only comes with around 50-60G of free space after you install the essentials) but I've loaded my music/files/programs etc. on there and it's more than enough. Plus its USB 3.0 ports means you could just buy a larger external or USB and it'll be just as fast.size: although the 11.6 inch screen needs getting used to at first, the amazing resolution really makes up for the screen size. That being said, it probably wouldn't work for you if you were long sighted... Also, they keyboard is very well-spaced for a 11.6 inch computer. The only flaw would be the small-ish arrow keys.) The weight of it is a huge plus since I carry it around a lot and it feels no heavier than my notebook (that being said it is a tad heavy for a tablet)screen: absolutely amazing. The inner screen is matte and looks incredible in all situations. So far the brightness has been fine in all situations (make sure you turn auto-brightness off to achieve max brightness)keyboard/trackpad: both work perfectly, although the trackpad takes getting used to since it's super-sensitive. I've had no problems with size of keyboard/any unresponsiveness.speakers: probably the best speakers I've seen on a computer.dual screen mode: it's excellent for comparing homework/ showing others your work without having to spin your computer around the whole time.tablet mode: pen input/response is great, even without calibration. If you wanted to play around on it with your fingers however, it might be a little finicky since the resolution is so high most of the time you won't hit what you want exactly. I use the tablet mode to take notes in class on powerpoints and slides (saves a lot on paper; plus you don't lose your notes) and it works great. It's still not AS precise as you may like it to be but all in all my writing is legible and gets the job done.The only con I really had was the battery life: I can squeeze out~4.5 hours if i set brightness to super low and do nothing but take notes. However, usually it lasts for about 3~4 which is fine between classes. Plus, the charger is super portable and light so it's really not a problem to carry around.  (Also people mentioned this before but the outer screen is a total fingerprint magnet). I did notice that in tablet mode my wrist kept hitting the windows button and making it go to the windows8 start-up screen.Overall there's nothing to not like about this computer and I would definitely recommend it if you're going to be carrying a computer around.", "Date": "March 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Combo", "Author": "drpret \"Preetham\"", "ReviewID": "R1G5APDMTUG9YJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had bought two of these, one for myself and one for my inlaws..

It's well built, and beautiful.  The screens are very high quality, the keyboard and trackpad are the best I have ever used.  It's not so heavy that you can't use it in portrait with one hand (unless you are a very weak person).  The pen works great and windows 8 flies on this thing.Now the bad.First thing you will notice is the inner screen has no touch.  I thought this would be a non issue, you have to be an idiot to reach up and touch the screen involuntarily.  But within the first hour I had reached up to touch it 5 times.  This quickly went from being a dumb thing I did, to being a mistake made by ASUS.Next thing is the crapware.  There's TONS OF IT.  Mostly crap made by ASUS that you will never use.  The good thing is most of it can be uninstalled.  But there are a few ASUS apps that must stay if you want the cool screen switching to work.THIS APP KILLS THE LAPTOP.  It's called ASUS Power 4 Gear and it controls the screens. The problem with it is it constantly fights windows.  An example is I used Power 4 gear to set my screen brightness and color temp on the inner display.  Then I needed the screen brighter so I did what anyone would do and used the brightness controls on the charms bar.  As soon as I changed it I lost all my backlights and color settings and they would not come back until I went into Power 4 gear and did it all over again.  The same thing happens when you close the lid and it switches to the outer display.  Non of your settings stay from the inner display.  This is a HUGE PAIN and ASUS should be ashamed of themselves for this software.  Honestly if this app was 'fixed' by ASUS this would be an good laptop, but right now this is the main thing that kills it.Another bad thing is the battery.  I used it for a few hours and you can literally watch the battery level drop, it's almost like it's animated it drops so fast.  My system came with a full charge and setting it up and a bit of HD youtube killed it in 2 and a half hours.  That is not acceptable in any way.One other gripe I have with it is the glass on the outer display.  It's great looking but it does not have a coating on it like a smartphone so fingerprints are EVERYWHERE and getting them off is not as easy as a wipe with your shirt.  You have to get a cloth and go to town on it if you are OCD like me.  I spent way too much time cleaning the damn lid on mine.In the end I returned this laptop and am getting a Surface pro.  I love the idea of the Taichi, but ASUS screwed up big time on the software and battery life.

NOT the case at all.  I considered several Windows 8 convertibles  before deciding on the ASUS Taichi.  I am soooo pleased with my decision.  I absolutely love this device.  Other reviews have been very detailed about the performance so I won't rehash those details.  I will provide updates as I continue using the Taichi over the next few weeks.  I must say I am amazed at the some of the reviews on other sites about this product.  Did ASUS just give out bad review units or what?  I have been using an iPad for over two years now and was very skeptical about any tablet ever taking it's place. However, slowly but surely the Taichi is changing my mind and I expect within another week or so I wont' even be using my iPad.  Now that is saying a lot for me to make that change because I love my iPad and have not travelled with a laptop in two years.  The only reason I give the Taichi 4 stars is the battery life.  But I knew that before I purchased the Taichi.  As has been mentioned several times, there is not a perfect \"hybrid\" or \"convertible\" solution so you just have to weigh the pro and cons of each product.  And yes the 2.7 lbs is heavier than my iPad but I have adjusted and it doesn't bother me at all.  This is a great product that doesn't deserve some of the reviews it is receiving on some of the tech sites.  I would love to purchase a thin cover that would fit over the tablet screen that would eliminate the \"finger print magnet\" effect while carrying the Taichi out of its supplied carrying pouch.Update 3/22/13:  I have been using the Taichi now for a couple of months and I am still loving this ultrabook. I am starting to see more people using Windows 8 convertibles which is nice to see. I still believe the Taichi was the best choice for my needs. I just purchased the Asus Suit/Cover for the Taichi and it fits perfectly. However, I am not having the same good fortune finding a portable battery to purchase that will work on the Taichi, so if anyone knows of one please let me know.

Now, the laptop will turn on but it will not charge beyond 0% !! No matter what I did, the charge level will not go beyond 0%. So, I thought the battery just need some calibration. I went to the BIOS to find \"Battery Calibration\", guess what, I couldn't not find any way to calibrate the battery. I searched to Asus support and found the steps to calibrate the battery through the BIOS but the steps are incorrect and couldn't find any way. So, I called the customer support and they confirmed that there is no way to calibrate the battery. So, the instruction in the website was incorrect (I was looking under Taichi 21 troubleshoot).Now the next problem. The top touchscreen doesn't respond to touch. I tried everything, made sure the \"Taichi mode\" was correct and everything. So, I wasted hours on the device I waited for so long.Asus, please don't rush with your product launch, do some testing and quality control.

But then again, you can get a basic touch screen laptop for half the price of the Taichi.I bought it so I could use the stylus to make art.  For me, I use programs like Photoshop and ZBrush, which rely on the WinTab driver to function properly.  Both ASUS and N-Trig (the company that develops the stylus) have ping-ponged me back and forth for the past 6 months.  Without the WinTab driver, the pen does NOT have the 256 levels of pressure sensitivity as advertised.  In fact it has no sensitivity at all.  While I do understand that non-artists would use the stylus, to me it seems like a more artist driven tool - one without a real use for a semi-serious artist on the Taichi.You also can't use programs like ZBrush and PS with the lid closed very well since they rely on keyboard shortcuts to function well.  There are external options like the bluetooth keyboards but why?The icing on the cake is ASUS support.  They claim to have a VIP line for Taichi owners.  One day I was on hold for 47-minutes and gave up.  That was the general vibe of calling them over the past few months.  There can't be THAT many Taichi owners out there.  :)But I seriously wish I could emphasize the incompetence and lack of real care the ASUS support team has.

I literally have never has a worse customer experience than I did with ASUS.I'm actually going to be looking for something else since this doesn't work for me.

The hardware is amazing. I love the 1080p screens. I love the large mouse pad. I love the backlight, chicklet keyboard. I love the inclusion of two USB 3.0 points. And I especially love the great audio coming out of this small package.SO MUCH THAT ANNOYS ME:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1. The two screens are recognized by Windows 8 as a main screen and a secondary monitor. This means that there is no easy built in way to adjust the brightness of the touch screen with Windows 8. The built in adjustments only work for your primary screen.2. Additionally, my ASUS smart gesture driver keeps randomly failing. I've reinstalled it multiple times. I've tried reinstalling Windows. But every other day, the driver just randomly quits out and I love my two finger gestures and those crucial Windows 8 swipes.3. The glass on the touch screen feels to flexible. Writing for hours a day in classes, I can feel the glass deform under my palm when writing and it really worries me. I previously owned a Fujitsu Lifebook tablet for 4 years and the glass touch screen was much more solid and just felt more reliable.4. The two screens packed into a thin lid make the computer unbalanced, and fatigue the hinge too easily. After a brief period of desktop only use, the hinge barely held the set position. The heavy screens always wanted to slip further back.SO MUCH THAT I HATE:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1. A had to return a Taichi because the touch screen kept registering false taps in the top right corner. This was stupidly frustrating since it messed up my gesture password and would randomly close programs. Imagine browsing the internet when randomly 10 blank tabs open. Having to return a Taichi for this reason just makes me question the outside glass surface even more.2. I had to return my second Taichi because the battery kept losing life. After two weeks of use the battery wouldnt charge beyond 89%. The charger's LED indicator never went green. Windows would always say \"89% charged, and not charging\" even though it was plugged in. I'm sure this will just get worse until the battery is completely dead. The Taichi doesn't have stellar battery life to begin with, but issues like these are inexcusable.IN CONCLUSION-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall there is much to love. Physically, this computer is one of the very best to launch with Windows 8. Unfortunately, this line of ultrabooks seem to be plagued by issues.

Occasionally I'll reboot if for example, the multi-touch feature is not working in laptop mode or there is no touch interface active in the tablet mode.  It is supposed to switch automatically when opening or closing the device. Sometimes it does not switch at all and you have to use the special screen mode key on the keyboard to select inner, outer or both screens, or toggle the lock switch if tablet mode is not working.Sometimes I wish it could do tent mode but the single screen mode with the device open is locked to sit like a backwards laptop, and tent mode would be upside down. I have had it work in tent mode before but that was because the drivers failed to switch occasionally. Usually it just turns on the laptop screen and turns off the tablet screen the minute you crack it open.In tablet mode, it does automatically re orient if not locked based on gravitational position, but sometimes it does not.The battery life is more like that of a typical laptop. You are lucky to get 3-4 hours out of it. The charging time can take more than a couple of hours, contrary to what some have suggested (30 minutes).I did have some intermittent problems with the touch screen digitizer and almost sent it back until I realized there would be a restocking fee (not an Amazon seller). Once in a while when powered on it acts as if a ghost is touching the upper right corner but it can be corrected by suspending and starting, and happens rarely now.

If you want more storage you'll have to use a clunkier USB drive, although it does have two high speed USB 3.0 ports.It sometimes seems a little slow with a few things open, and probably because of all the ASUS bloatware, but I should have considered an i7 model with 8GB of RAM.On the plus side, it is light sleek and amazingly thin for a clam shell.The dual screen can be useful for presenting PowerPoint  or other material in mirror or extended mode,  but I'd practice and iron out possible issues before taking it to a customer site.I did upgrade to 8.1 and it had no issues, but I will attempt to update all ASUS drivers to see if some of the other issues can be improved.All in all, I'm happy with the purchase, and people who see it really think it's pretty cool, but I would consider a single screen device with a longer battery life I had to buy again.

I called at least  five times to fix hybrid issues, such as automatic switching screen functions from laptop  to tablet and rotating screen. It is a pain when you switch the OS, not only you have to save all your files, but do all updates and reinstall all your own apps and software. Certainly Win 8.1 functions much better than Win 8.0, as MS added back the Start button you can easily find what you need. Also you can search for new apps in its Window's store,but  you can't do this in Win 8.0. You have to pick whatever is available in the store. The battery life is bad only last less than 3 hours, sometimes can't sit through my 2 hours meetings if I forget to charge it before the meeting. Asus really needs to improve that. Battery life is critical for why we need a hybrid.So make sure you check if the machine updated to the new OS before you buy it or call Asus to see if they really come up with updates for the new OS.", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Piece of junk", "Author": "Macutak", "ReviewID": "R3VC2KYSJL7CZQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First one crashed and could not be fixed.

I was looking for a Windows 8 convertible that offered a good typing experience and that also had an active digitizer. There are only so many non-Atom based Windows 8 products that offer the digitzer (e.g., Surface Pro, Vaio Duo 11/13, Taichi, ATIV Tab 7, Helix), and I'd gotten my hands on all but the Taichi and the Helix before making my purchase. Typing on the other offerings was less than stellar, while the Taichi and Helix appeared to offer really good keyboards for the size. Getting a Core i7 Taichi with a 256gb SSD for several hundred dollars less than a Core i5 Helix seemed like a good deal, so I purchased.The machine itself looked and felt great. Some people don't like the dual display with the non-touch interior screen, but if you order this, you know what you're getting. For me, the trackpad worked fine for gestures on the interior matte screen. Also, typing on the keyboard was smooth, and the matte screen was easy on the eyes. The external display was nice and worked well with the included N-Trig pen. The displays themselves are a bit on the dim side, but if you're working indoors, it's not an issue.The problem was my battery wouldn't charge at all. Plugged it in all day, and it still wouldn't power on when not connected to an outlet. I understand that the Taichi has poor battery life (around 4 hours), but my unit had no battery life. I called ASUS, and their technical support line, though nice, couldn't do anything for me over the phone. They offered to repair and return it to me, but I wasn't interested in doing that with a brand new product. A secondary problem was that the special Taichi button didn't work.  Two big problems with it right out of the box. I returned it.Reading the other reviews on Amazon and elsewhere, I knew that some people had complaints about the Taichi that suggested it may have been rushed (faulty digitzers or screens, battery issues, issues with screen switching, etc.), but I ordered anyway because I felt there was a lot of upside to it. I considered ordering a new one since I liked a lot about the product, but ultimately I didn't want to spend $1100+ on a computer and then worry a lot about the product failing. I realize that's a possiblity with any tech product, but with the Taichi, it seems it's more of a likelihood. At this point, I'll probably wait until the Sony Vaio Fit Multiflip, Tap 11, Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga, or Surface Pro 2 come out to see what the new round of Windows 8 products with active digitizers are like.", "Date": "September 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "So disappointed", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1FHC597B4WJR8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered this in August of 2013.

The entire computer had been wiped and the software was different. I had to re do everything on it. I have been using again for a month and the tablet screen has gone wonky. A hardware issue so ASUS wants me to ship it out again. I don't have another 30 days to wait on this computer to get fixed again and there are no service centers near me. With the first unit I had many issues with volume control and calibration issues with the touch screen. It just didn't work well. This second unit works much better but the tablet screen is completely unusable. The tablet was the whole reason I got it. I just can't afford another 30 days to wait on it getting fixed again.

Dual screen \"Taichi\" mode is still flakey even after reverting back to Windows 8.At this price one would expect better support from ASUS.

When completely folded, the Asus is beautiful, but upon opening you can see the aesthetics take a nosedive.  The front/main screen has a thick bezel that surrounds it and makes it look cheap.  I can now see that the stock pictures of the front don't go into too much detail.Even so, that still wasn't enough for me to send it back.  I fired it up and loaded some software and updates.  After three days I couldn't stand it.  The touchpad kept sensing movement when I wasn't even near it.  And I couldn't believe how frustrating it was to have a non-touchscreen as the main display.  It was my first Windows 8 machine and now I understand all the reviews that criticize non-touchscreen laptops with Windows 8.  They're terrible.  I think the Taichi had so much potential.  If it had a front/main screen that was touch I think it would have been my best laptop purchase.

A firmware update is really needed for this convertible to operate as advertised. Part of the problem is the implementation of Windows 8. This machine seems to sometimes fight for what it wants to do against Windows.  Things like the the lights constantly flickering as the brightness constantly adjusts, the touch pad scrolling working intermittently, the touch screen scrolling also working intermittently and so on.On the plus side, this convertible is light enough and the form factor is a joy to use. But use as a tablet is hampered by the touchscreen browser experience. You'll close the lid in frustration and resort to using it as an ultra book in all but mandatory drawing activities. Also, one of my biggest pet peeves is the super bright Windows button on the tablet side of the computer. Super annoying as you can't shut it off or dim the beam as it shines directly into your soul (and eye). I really hate that button and it keeps me from being able to comfortably enjoy reading (via the Kindle app)in tablet mode (one of my big reasons for buying this). It's also annoying when trying to watch a movie and you'll end up just opening the laptop up, turning off the keyboard light and using it that way (although there is still the mildly annoying wifi light that only turns off when you turn off wifi, which in turns turns off any streaming you're probably doing).Not going to go much more into Windows 8, but anything you don't like about it is probably present here. Having you swipe to get things done is one thing, but when that feature randomly stops working (happens a lot), it turns into another dance of frustration.  And don't get me started on the Windows Store or it's apps. Super half baked. The quality of the few apps are terrible and most times take away features of the normal (Windows 7)desktop programs. Trust me, skip most \"8\" versions and use the regular (Windows 7)programs instead. You're welcome.  A lot of programs still struggle to fight through the bloat that is Windows 8. Super small example, Skype won't ever go away unless you exit out of the program. It just sits in your toolbar refusing to go away. \"X\" means nothing.So to sum things up... If you're offered a really good deal on this and it's cheaper than a comparable ultra book, then go for it. A lot of the Windows 8 problems are going to be universal, so you're going to have to work around them if you want a new \"8\" laptop. The second screen is slick and the transition from laptop to tablet is really well done, so if you have business need for the second screen then go for it.

In terms of features/price, I think this one has them beat (if not just for the gorgeous dual full HD IPS screens and dual webcams, as well as wow factor).-Aesthetically, it seems similar to a Macbook Air, but has a slightly better build quality and better keyboard. The aluminum chassis does not feel like cheap dollar store pot metal and the hinge does not seem to be made from cheap plastic.-It only gets slightly warm on full load, and the fans barely ever make any noise whatsoever.-Audio quality is great, externally and internally. The speakers can get surprisingly loud.-Camera quality is about as good as the camera(s) on a modern smartphone.-Many people seem to be worried about damaging the outer screen, which is covered in Gorilla glass. I've bumped and nicked it a few times lightly on some surfaces, but there still isn't a scratch on it.-At first I thought using the device in tablet mode would be mostly pointless much like with my old TX2500. However, with Windows 8/Windows RT apps, I have found myself using this mode equally, if not more often than laptop mode.That being said, there are a few minor imperfections with it (like with any laptop).Hardware-This thing is a fingerprint magnet, both outside and inside. Luckily, it comes with not one, but two cleaning cloths for some reason.-Battery life is probably one of the larger flaws, though 4-4.5 hours of light to average use isn't awful for an i5 ultrabook. It usually charges from low batt. in around an hour or less, so I don't mind.-No, triple screen does not work, and I was not expecting it to work.Software-The Taichi Home software can be finicky at times, occasionally trying to figure out which mode it is currently in on wake and enabling the correct screen.-There isn't a WinTab driver out yet, so pressure sensitivity in Photoshop or Paint Tool Sai do not work. I've heard N-Trig is supposedly still working on this, though. ArtRage and OneNote detect pressure fine.-One of the things I miss the most is how customizable Synaptics touchpad drivers were. Don't get me wrong, the massive touchpad and Asus gestures work fine. I just miss tap zones and cursor momentum.-There also seemed to be a CPU throttling bug that was easily fixed by installing an updated touchpad driver.-Asus partitions quite a bit of the drive for recovery (20 GB image) leaving you a 93 GB partition (with the 128 GB SSD). Take that and the 20 GB Windows 8 installation, and you're left with about 60 something GB of user space. Personally, I just tacked on a tiny 64 GB flash drive and moved my static files there and left the SSD more open for programs.-Custom Asus software means a little more RAM usage than a vanilla install. Probably 100 MB give or take, but with soldered RAM, every byte counts.I've found this ultrabook convertible to be perfect for reading muh chinese girl comics and watching chinese girl cartoons.Overall, this laptop is well-built and worth exactly (if not more) what you pay for, as well as wonderfully fun and interesting to use.", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Learn from my mistake.", "Author": "User409", "ReviewID": "RLCEHEGQXZGB2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Upon writing this review I have had an Asus Taichi in my posession for around 3 months give or take a week or two. Now I purchased and received the laptop in AUGUST of last year, but this 2 pound $950 chunk of crap has been at the ASUS RMA center far longer than it has been with me.First and foremost the laptop on paper is a great machine, a reasonably powerful processor, enough ram for windows 8 to run, a 256 SSD, and the ability to be used as a tablet or a laptop at a whim.Too bad this was nothing more than a proof of concept model that should have NEVER been released to the public. Updated drivers break the device and seem to conflict with the laptops auto update program in a never ending struggle to have the worst possible driver for any given component. They advise you to upgrade to windows 8.1... too bad they forgot to update the drivers to work correctly with it and an upgrade results in nothing but your touch screen being disabled and your touchpad breaking as well(google taichi windows 8.1 black screen). Asus has done nothing but laugh at those unfortunate enough to purchase this device.As for the company selling the laptop (ASUS incase you forgot) I have never in my life dealt with a more shady, underhanded, deceitful company. I have been forced to interact with their so called \"taichi VIP support\"  around 30 times trying to get my issues resolved, and Ive been hung up on around 10 times. I am very patient on the phone too, so dont assume im being nasty. It really does seem like they are trained to just put you on hold for 30 min in hopes you'll get frustrated and hang up, and if you dont then they just hang up on you anyway. Somehow the first person you are connected to is always \"highest ranking manager on call\" which anyone with half a brain can tell is a flat out lie and a refusal to escalate your case.Across these 30 some odd calls my laptop was RMAed 4 times. Out of the box the laptop had crashing and overheating issues so I sent it for repair, it came back with a broken screen, so once again I RMAed it, now the screen worked but they somehow broke the SSD and windows could not even load (HOW they managed to send a dead laptop back from a repair center is a testament to the quality of ASUS), then finally on the fourth RMA they replaced my brand new $1.6k (at the time)ultrabook with a refurbished model with a 90 day warranty. They actually took away my purchase warranty and gave me a 90 day one... Not only that buy most of the people I spoke with would literally tell me anything I wanted to hear to get me to hang up the phone, around 7 different technicians told me I qualified for a replacement laptop of equal value made by ASUS, this turned out be a lie and they conveniently forgot to put in the notes they promised me a new computer. Their repair technicians are no better, during my last RMA I was directed to provide video and image proof of my issues to the repair tech working on my laptop before they would work on it (because clearly im a criminal who needs to prove these kinds of things). These technicians was just as deceitful as the rest of the support team as he tried to email me (from the same address we had spoke on) posing as someone else telling me he was the VP of repairs or something, when he deemed a new model replacement (I asked for a new taichi to make up for all the time lost and damage done to it from the repair center) not doable. Thus I end up with a beat Frankenstein laptop with no warranty.Now the referb has been working semi well for around a month (even though this one also has overheating issues [no laptop CPU should idle at 76 C, though asus assures me this is normal...]) and recently it started to bug out (same problems EVERYONE with this laptop comes across screen rotation, overheating...etc). So once again I picked up the phone and was connected with someone at the asus repair center, they took down my info put me on hold, then 25 minutes later hung up on me. I guess they win and I lose, they got my money and I have still not received a working laptop.Learn from my mistake. This is a terrible device that is absolutely riddled with flaws and broken features(for christ sake the updater program by default causes an infinite restarting loop and has since its release), and if you do make the mistake of buying an ASUS product you better be damn sure NOTHING goes wrong with it or you will find yourself dealing with people who will do nothing but lie to you to get you to hang up that phone.DO NOT buy this laptop, it was by far the most expensive mistake I have ever made and Ive found its impossible to sell, so you will be stuck with it till the power plug breaks (common issue) and bricks the device.", "Date": "February 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great idea - but falls short", "Author": "Pudge68", "ReviewID": "R3HGTZ3J5MQQ2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I love the concept - but for me, this hybrid has a lot of problems* the native resolution (1920x1080)makes thing VERY hard to see.

I literally need to use a magnifying glass at time...BEWARE IF YOU USE CITRIX* the brightness will self adjust at random.  very annoying* the charger is a little bulky and will fall out of the wall socket quite easily* the \"tablet\" screen has also STOPPED WORKING all together...in ANY mode!  ASUS says I have to reset the entire system, deleting the progs I have loaded.  this is a huge pain especially since there is no optical drive and all progs have to be re-downloaded.

Immediately upon receiving it, the touchscreen lid was pushing too hard into the ordinary notebook screen and it had to be sent back not once, but twice to try and fix it. The next big issue came when Windows 8.1 was released. Long story short, driver conflicts between Windows 8.1 and the Taichi caused the touchscreen lid to be unusable. A BIOS update was released FOUR MONTHS LATER to fix the problem. However, attempting to update the BIOS from the touchscreen caused it to freeze during the process and render the machine unusable, and so it was sent back to ASUS for a THIRD time. After the release of Windows 8.1 Update 1 (an update that made it easier for desktop/mouse users to use Windows 8.1), neither screen would boot without Safe Mode. In the end, another BIOS update was released and the problems seem to have finally gone away.My Thoughts: There is no laptop on the market like it. The true and original ultrabook with the ability to have 2 screen at once and flip between them with ease. I had owned an ASUS Vivobook X200 and felt I wanted something more tablet orientated. Many laptops that came out around the same time period and some laptops that have come out today offer far less for equal if not more money. A similarly priced $1000 laptop wouldn't have things like a solid state drive or a touchscreen, let alone 2 screens that you could use simultaneously. While still starting with Windows 8 and being $300 cheaper than it's release price, it's worth every penny compared to what others give you for much more money.Conclusion: It is a wonderful laptop and feels very professional. But with such uniqueness comes a price.

Overall I am very pleased with this purchase. Like others, there are a few quirks that are more annoying than problematic but I have NOT run into any issues with it crashing nor have I had any problems with the digitizer. I will say that I do not use this laptop for work but almost exclusively for entertainment purposes. I have it on for an average of 12 hours a day surfing the 'net, emailing, using social networks, watching movies, playing games, streaming content, touching-up photos, and listening to music. It never crashes. Pros are many - cons are few:Pros: - Gorgeous screen. Movies look great. Web sites look great in both landscape and portrait mode. - Fast. The i7 processor is fast and runs every program I have loaded with no issues. Even games run fine though this isn't my main gaming computer and I don't think I would recommend it for hardcore gaming. For casual gamers like myself, this works just fine. - Touch screen is responsive and amazingly durable. The \"gorilla\" glass is solid despite being lightweight. - Sound is adequate. What do you expect from a laptop barely an inch thick? Little speakers like that will sound small no matter what you do but they do have good spatial range. (Use headphones if you want better sound.) - It's quiet if you don't put the Taichi plastic case (purchased separately) on it. I love the case but took it off because it made the laptop quite hot and I could hear the fan running at top speed to keep the processor cool. - It's light. I have a disability in my hands and don't have much strength but can carry this around with one hand. - Boots up immediately. My Lenovo running Windows 7 takes long enough for me to make a cup of tea and get settled before logging in for work. I barely have a chance to sit down in the time this takes to boot. - Powered USB port lets you charge with the computer off. Never had that before and I like it. Handy.Cons: - I got the SSD with 256 GB of space and was not pleased to learn they had partitioned it in half and taken 24 GB for recovery and ASUS files. I planned to add an external drive anyway so this is not a huge issue. But the partition was unnecessary and I would prefer to have that storage all on my C-drive. Unfortunately, I cannot extend that boot partition - only shrink it - so this is going to sit there wasted for now. - Screen brightness and initial orientation are wonky. Even if you manually lock both when you switch from laptop mode to tablet mode, the screen brightness changes and sometimes (rarely) the orientation is upside-down. And like others, moving the slider dims the screen but I can't figure out how to get it brighter if I want. I rarely like the screen that bright and the highest slider setting is OK 95% of the time for me. But this can leave you scratching your head as to why the levels are always moving around. The upside-down screen always corrects itself if I open the lid and then close it but this is also more annoying than problematic. - Touchpad is VERY sensitive and if you happen to rest a finger or part of your palm on a tiny corner, it won't work. Once I figured out what was going on it was easy to correct my bad habits but it was quite annoying at first. - Ports - only two USB ports, a mini-VGA port (huh?), and a micro-HDMI port. Granted, this laptop is razor thin so there isn't a lot of room for more ports but I would have been happier with one more USB port instead of the worthless mini-VGA. And while micro-HDMI is getting more common, finding long cables with a micro adaptor on one side is a challenge that I remedied with a micro to standard adaptor plug. It's inelegant but it works.I would purchase this laptop again in a heartbeat. It does everything I need it to do and having both a tablet and a laptop in one unit is ingenious. I'm surprised more companies aren't making equipment like this. Like others, I was skeptical about how it would work but after using it for two months, I don't know how I lived without it. Moving between screens is so natural and seamless that I find myself missing the functionality of this device on my other computer.

In my personal experience; this is a solid work laptop and a travelers dream.  No doubt there are things ASUS can work on, but I'm a loyal ASUS customer because I expect they'll improve on the fantastic Taichi21 with the next model they release.  I certainly hope they keep this line for many years to come because it's all the technology I've been waiting for in one package.  I hope that people don't blame ASUS and the Taichi for numerous problems rooted squarely in Windows 8 and the various shortfalls it suffers.In summary, the Taichi21 is an amazing upgrade for a longtime TimelineX 11.6\" user.  You won't be disappointed if you do your research before ordering this machine.  From the dual LCD's and camera's, to the backlit keyboard, and amazing touchpad.  There's more to love than loath in this great laptop.There's one CON...the utter lack of memory.  While I realize that Win8 runs \"smaller\" than previous Windows versions, 4GB simply isn't enough for today's multitasking.  With a strong i7 and 256GB SSD; the 4GB is a silly way to save money in a world where 8GB is the minimum in a $1000+ market corner.

I believe it is one of the more interesting ones. But i couldnt give it a perfect score for a few reasons. First off let me just state I got the i5 version and i got it used for around $680 with shipping. Because it was used it came with a few minor issues such as barely noticable scratches and a hard to see light area on the touch screen. but i'm ignoring these issues when writing this review.This is a very capable machine with a fairly sturdy and solid feel. Ive managed to game on it (eve online), use virtual machines on it, transfer large files etc. and it seems to have the power to do all of these without any problems. It is a great all around machine. And looks nice too. I love the size and weight, design is awesome.The reason its a 3 star product instead of a 4 or 5 star one is simple: in my experience its kind of buggy. Annoyingly so sometimes. I could be in laptop mode with the touchscreen completly off and out of no where its like a ghost is using the touch screen. Moving stuff around, closing windows etc. its difficult to fix without just turning the power off.I have a windows 8.1 pro dvd and yes i reinstalled several times and made sure to download any drivers it needed. It may be i missed a few drivers ( i hope) but this is a serious problem to me. Another issue i have from time to time is the trackpad stops recognizing gestures.

(apple and android are not options, i'm not into art and, i have to actually use it productively) (and lenovo is known for bugging their computers, sorry china not interested)Assumptions:Price range: 500-900screen size: 10.6 is too small for a laptop... 13.3+ is slightly too big for a tablet. (the 27in all-in-one that's actually a tablet is awesome but unwieldy)Performance: for price and form factor, It is assumed i will have to game on my desktop... all 3 options are able to handle everyday computing seamlessly, and are essentially the same spec wise.Overall Cons: Windows 8/8.1 is designed for touch screens, but still well behind android. But, that's the trade-off if you want something to feel like a computer not a phone. SSDs are becoming reasonable in price for performance, but their reliability over time is questionable... if you abuse you device, SSDs are the way to go, they have a much higher shock tolerance, but if you treat it as a computer/laptop and expect it to last >3 years go with a HDD.ASUS Taichi: $699 + $99 for 2 year accident (note on sale originally 1099)Pros:Feels sturdy, 11.6 in is better than 10.6, dual screens is an awesome solution to that flipping issue! I personally love ASUS, they have an exceptional reliability program and in my opinion the only reason apple is popular (ASUS is the primary manufacture of apple products, the only good thing about apple is reliability) (the average consumer just wants the computer to work... reliably)Cons: 3-4 hr battery life...Dell XPS-12: $699 @ windows store, I do not own, just got a feel at a brick & mortarPros: 12.5 in screen is a great compromise, 8.5 hr battery life is perfect!Cons: a little worried about the flip issues... felt sturdy enough but still worried, and dell isn't know for great quality...Sony Vaio Flip:$999 @ best buy, I do not own, just got a feel at a brick & mortarPros: felt sexy, professional, and flip option was awesome once locked inCons: In-between flipping you had to be careful not to break in half... pricy $300 more that other options (this one just wasn't on sale at the time....)After buying: had a few annoyance issues with windows, but the ASUS Taichi works great, both myself (high tech level) and wife (low tech level) enjoy using it.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "No Connectivity out of the box", "Author": "Sartore's", "ReviewID": "R3NA3X8EIHO1X6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The specs and description of this ultrabook was just what I was looking for, but right out of the box, there was no connectivity to the internet.

There are scads of professional reviews online that provide some good information. However, it's worth repeating that one must first decide what the point of having two screens that you can't see at the same time is. For me, I wanted to try something just as goofy as Windows 8.The out-of-box experience was pretty bad. Mine crashed several times and was then followed by 8-10 reboots. The first for Windows Update, and the rest for ASUS Live Update. That being said, I am glad it was updating itself. The accelerometer didn't work at all, then behaved erratically, then finally started working. Mysteriously, the screen will sometimes flip upside down without being moved at all.The hard drive came in two partitions, one 95.3 GB for the OS and the remaining 117 GB for DATA. Makes no sense to me, but it was easy enough to delete the DATA volume and then extend the OS drive with the available space - something I recommend doing right away.The second display runs in standard Windows dual-monitor mode. This makes \"Extended Display\" quite useless in most scenarios. Unless you want to do something that requires no cursor or keyboard actions (such as watch a movie, or, umm, let the person sitting behind you watch a movie) then you'll be constantly battling for control. Think of a single workstation with two monitors, two keyboards, two mice, and two people trying to do something and you'll get the idea. That being said, it could easily handle watching a compressed 1080p movie on one screen and Angry Birds Star Wars on the other without dropping a frame.A final negative thought is how difficult reinstalling Windows will be. I think it would have been simple enough to include a $10 \"Reinstall/Recovery\" USB stick with a $1600 unit. When the day comes to format this bad boy it's going to be a battle royale. Just looking at the ASUS driver web site (which was down most of the day) makes me cringe.There are some things I like about it. Another reviewer mentioned the fact that one screen gets all gummed with finger-prints and the other stays nice and clean, I agree wholeheartedly. My overall impression of Windows 8 on a touchscreen (and this isn't my first) is that it's really great for goofing off with things like paint or games, but you're not going to get any serious work done with it.In the end, it's like a mullet: Business in the front, party in the back! (but not at the same time)UPDATE 01-22-2013: The last round of Windows updates turned my screen rotation off again. It was easy enough to fix, from \"tablet\" mode you need to go to the screen resolution control panel and turn it back on. I think the way the ASUS software interacts with Windows 8 is the most annoying part of this laptop. The help of \"Taichi VIP support\" is laughable, which means this could be a real lemon for a basic user.

ASUS claims! that the product is covered with an international warranty. This is my story: after my broken key, I immediately contacted ASUS in my home country (Turkey). After 1 hour wait time, I was told that it was user-caused and not covered within the warranty. They also said that there is no spare key (letter T), and I need to replace the whole keyboard/case. As this is a unibody laptop, it would cost me around $170. I was very upset.I contacted ASUS US. I was told that there is nothing that they can do about it, except they asked me to pay another visit or ship it overseas. The customer center repeatedly emphasized that this is user-fault. I was frustrated.Luckily I was able to find some 2nd hand keyboard online and had my key replaced at a local store. (being absolutely sure that it will void the warranty, and they would have charged me another $100 just to put it in at the ASUS center).

About 2 weeks later I woke up to find my computer off, this was alarming but I started trying to get it to start, no luck so I thought back to that fall and reached for my special VIP Tiachi support card and called them up from here on it\u2019s a sad story, there wasn\u2019t much trouble shooting to be done since it was not turning on but I have the VIP support so I\u2019m expecting that door to door thing to kick in, well my VIP support tech is telling me that\u2019s not the case and I would need to box it up and send the thing back and forget door to door He is telling I will need to pay the shipping to a depot and expect 2 weeks before I hear anything, now this is not sounding VIP or anything close to what made me buy this special unit, so I ask for a supervisor thinking this support guy just doesn\u2019t know the whole VIP deal while waiting I bring up the amazon page on my phone just to be sure I am not insane and no it still says door to door VIP special support and a year of ADP, about this time the supervisor comes on and says the same thing the underling said send it back at your cost, so I explain the reason I bought the Tiachi and that I wasn\u2019t feeling the VIP love and I literally had to send him to Asus\u2019s own page telling me all of what I\u2019m saying is exactly what\u2019s on their support page, so during the long wait I looked at the ADP page not for this unit but another and it says it\u2019s A SINGLE USE PLAN !! this is confirmed to me by the supervisor by this point I am a little upset but I had remembered that it was plugged in when it took it giant leap of 2 feet on to the carpet and sure enough the light was off on the power supply I explained this and asked for a new supply and that this not be used as my one use ADP I was newly made aware I had been hosed into, that was also a big negative he then came up with he would send me a rma and again in up to 2 weeks I could find out if it was the supply but should they find it was the power and not the fall I would be charged for the new supply and the shipping both ways I asked for names and declined. I ordered a supply from amazon and that was the issue. I then opened a BBB complaint against Asus and after 3 months of back and forth their position has not changed this can all be seen on BBB.org I was also told I wasn\u2019t to publicly recite their response when I said I would yell this to anyone who would listen and didn\u2019t agree to any non-disclosure Asus cut off commutation. So if anyone has read all this keep shopping or at least know that Asus actively engages in DECIPTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES and FALSE ADVERTISING yet here the same units are being sold by Amazon using the lies that made me sorry I ever heard the name Taichi. Again this is all public record on [...] along with the other thousands of complaints, how Amazon can let this go on I really don\u2019t know..The style of the Taichi line is very good it defiantly has made people ask who makes your laptop- So it does look goodAs for the  functionality there are some drawbacks after 8 months of use some are glaring some are just annoying  from a function standpoint one of the main reasons I went with Asus over the other hybrid convertible ultrabooks was the stylus it was important to me I use one note a lot and also use a stylus to draw diagrams for my work. I had been using the Asus Ep121 slate it had its issues but overall performed well when it worked but that used a Wacom stylus and that is leaps and bounds above this- First it takes a AAAA battery but that\u2019s ok if it worked well, but it does not half the time it won\u2019t engage and when it does it\u2019s hardly accurate ,but once you get used to its flaws you can make it do what needs done, just plan on erasing a lot and starting over. Now on to the screen\u2019s you can watch a movie or you tube ect on the touch side it\u2019s a nice clear picture of course with only 4 gigs of ram and a underpowered processor along with the integrated Intel video card you get pretty much what you would expect, and for the inner side screen in laptop mode it\u2019s just plain bad it has some kind of coating on it that makes everything look almost milky it\u2019s good for word-processing and other business apps in fact it\u2019s the only way you can use most apps, even with apps that have touch support they don\u2019t work right with Taichi\u2019s touch so get used to laptop mode for work but you will also have to get an external mouse the touchpad on this thing will drive you insane they tried to make the touchpad like it was a touchscreen and it didn\u2019t work out pinch and zoom and Asus\u2019s own shortcut\u2019s via touchpad are enough to make you want a refund but you can tweak it and get some use but hey no big deal most laptop touch\u2019s suck. The last point on function I will talk about is power and battery and this was another selling point for me seeing the Centrino name again gave me high hopes but it was not to be you can expect 2 hours of outside on a nice day work time just sit in the shade because you will have a lot of glare or dark issues on either screen.", "Date": "May 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Beautiful piece of crap", "Author": "Mike Akrish", "ReviewID": "R3N8U37UEHPAH2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The most beautiful laptop I have had but It hardly works.

Amazon customer service was nice enough to offer a refund but I wasn't offered compensation for the time and effort lost getting the computer from ups (they didn't leave it at the door as I expected) and the refund will only hit my account 3-5 business days after the receive the product back which could end up taking 3 weeks according to the rep I spoke with.

To sum up, it's a good idea and all but I'd rather have a twist/yoga-type.  You can't even write on the inner screen - you have to flip the thing down for touch features, then flip it back up for typing, over and over - it sucks; no swiping through Windows 8 and then typing something or whatever - not unless you want to flip or run behind your computer over and over.  It also doesn't feel equivalent to ipad balance/feel when in tablet mode, it feels like you're holding two stacked ipads or something - and you can feel more heat and churning (vibrations/sounds) of the computer more.  This one says it's 11.6 inches but mine is around 13\", which just makes the whole thing feel too awkwardly large (and heavy) to hold - maybe 11.6\" is a better feel.  I don't see how one could not fear the outer screen getting dinged up without some screen protector, and the pen has to use batteries - which sucks.
