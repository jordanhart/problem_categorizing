All of them are still up and running strong and we are very happy with them for the money. They are more than enough hardware for school or business.Not for high end gaming, but play descent games at medium settings and are great for HD movies.", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "New owner", "Author": "Diana L.

I have never owned a laptop before and have been wanting one for some time.  This laptop is bigger than most, but I love the widescreen.  I would definitely recommend it to those that are in the market for one.  It may not have all the bells and whistles but well worth the money!!!", "Date": "August 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "wish it would have lasted longer", "Author": "bamboo2112", "ReviewID": "R3CXQ7QRJ28WIU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I also bought this computer at Wal mart. I thought that I had done a good job of researching the reviews before buying. After sixteen months the computer completely died while watching a DVD. I checked my BIOS battery and was running up to date Norton 360. I called Toshiba and they offered to fix it for $350.00. After researching several forums I learned that this computer has a heat problem(mine never ran too hot)and that you need to have it fully taken a part every year to clean and repaste the heat sink. In the end I salvaged the hard drive and will never buy a computer on sale from Wal mart again.", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Computer", "Author": "F. Lawrence \"Too Taxed\"", "ReviewID": "R3O4YJJLDEN4A8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the average person what a wonderful buy. I had been looking for 2 years for a basic laptop at a decent price. Bought it at Walmart for $348.00. I have used it for about a month and am more than pleased with my purchase. It has good speed, the 17\" screen is very nice, the portability is great(set up wirelessly and use anywhere around the house), battery lasts about 2.5 hours(on balanced setting)or plug it in. Vista basic is actually not too bad. The only thing I added was Windows Office 2003(because I'm used to it),however the existing software is adequate. All in all a good solid computer.", "Date": "September 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Toshiba Satellite L255-S7915", "Author": "E.
