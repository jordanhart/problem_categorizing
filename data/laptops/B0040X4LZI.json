Looks and feels sturdy, minimum flex, relatively light, excellent display (fonts could be sharper), very nice keyboard, DVD writer, and enough RAM (4GB) and HD (320 GB) for normal home use.  No HDMI port, weak sound, and no fancy bells and whistles. Battery life seems to be reasonable (3 hrs fully charged on a 6-cell battery). Overall, an excellent value for money, especially compared to similarly configured Dell, Sony, or Toshiba (which cost anywhere from $150 to $250 more).", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Laptop For Productivity", "Author": "M.

Great price for performance. Although I upgraded the SSD, which made a significant improvement, even without the laptop is quick.2. Easy to upgrade, if desired. Removing the back panel reveals the CPU and hard drive bay. Personally I had a 80GB SSD sitting around from my previous laptop so I replaced the 320GB HD with it. Huge improvement, instantaneous loading is FTW.3. Good battery life. After a few discharges, I'm currently getting ~3 hours of battery life with non-intensive use.Cons:1. Headphone static when laptop is plugged in. Not overwhelming but clearly there. Seems to be a common issue with G560's.2. Laptop charger cord is a little short. Another foot would have been much appreciated.", "Date": "October 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good value for money", "Author": "srtalukdar", "ReviewID": "R30GMUY6430JUB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything is fine.

I am used to that as I am typing on a 6 year old Everex machine that I have pared down to run very smoothly and has never given my any problems that I did not create.  SO.  I understand low-end, economy, yet I want it to do the max possible for the dollar.  This is it in my opinion.  Even though it is not top-notch in some areas, what you get for around $400 or so, I feel is WELL worth this small expense.Some highlights.Textured plastic case.  No fingerprints.  Some have remarked negatively about the touchpad.  It is textured as well- that may be their issue.  So, at first, when you are using it, your finger does not slide easily.  It is a matter of pressure as I got used to it within a minute.It is a dual core Pentium, albeit a basic one.  No hyperthreading and some of the other tech that takes basic to WOW.  Big HDD for the price- spin speed is 5400 on the HDD.  Hmmmmm.  As it says- for surfing, burning the occasional disc off, and general computing needs, I think that this does a great job.We have kids, and I was worried about OneKey restore being right there for all to see on the upper part of the deck above the keyboard!  Yikes.  Can't disconnect the use of the key (at least I haven't found a way yet), but it can be password protected.  So I am cool with that.It is relatively light @ not quite 6 lbs.  Replacement batteries aren't that expensive, and, should you need to go portable around the house, 4 hours is plenty to sit and research something, or do a bit more.  Haven't done much else with it, so I may come back and list some other plusses or minuses as they arise.Bottom line- the computer that this is replacing, another Everex that utterly died after almost all day, everyday use for about 5 years, met our expectations- (not exceeded) THIS Lenovo will continue to exceed.Update: 3.15.2011Still great.  After loading up all that we needed to, our programs, photos, screensaver, extras, catching up on all of the updates from various and sundry places... still GREAT.  Web: Browsing is only a second or two delay and then nearly instantaneous on filling out the whole page.  Do remember that this machine is not tops on anything- so I find the speed exceptional.  I had 3 different programs in various stages of loading, downloading, and installation, and they were all done in lightspeed fashion, with no locking up, no hold ups, no hitches.  Done in a New York Minute.Keyboard is well arranged, responsive, and does not miss a beat.  Dual number key pads... sometimes an assistance.Hate to say it, never been overboard on Microsoft products, but Seven is good.  No problems so far, like Vista.  Always had to come up with workarounds for that OS.  Ugh.  Not so here.  All set up and customized.  Works GREAT and without any hitches with the various Freeware that I use.  You know, let me touch on that one.I have NEVER had a computer crash due to anything other than hardware failure due to heavy use and age.  With that said, here are the programs that I like to use, again it is all Freeware, and all of it is from CNET.  Here is the list, in order of use to clean up your system entirely:Free Registry FixCOMODO System CleanerIObit Advanced System CareSpyware TerminatorIObit Smart Defrag #2 BetaI find that these programs work very well together, no matter what OS you use from XP through Windows 7, cause no conflicts, and keep your system totally clean of everything, and running as fast as is possible.Screen quality is great.  Very tight for roughly 720 video and picture quality.Lastly- sound quality is great.  Once you dive into Windows to customize your setting, you come across an area of sound customization, including I believe 10 band graphic equalizer, or presets like concert, rock, or classical and the like- and, then you can set up the 3d perceptual range and some other functions.  Very nice.  Makes these little speakers sound so much better, so much more presence, and even, dare I say it, a little note of 3D digitally manipulated Bass?  Surprising, but true!Buy this computer.  I love it, and have had an easy time of things using it, setting it up, and the customization of Windows is a lot of fun.Buy it.  I have no cons on this for the price.  Not one.", "Date": "March 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lenovo G650 Series 067999U", "Author": "SSD", "ReviewID": "R2QEH2LASA3HM8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far, this laptop has been wonderful. Windows-7 is a bit of a learning curve if you're used to XP (like I am), but so far it's been simple to use. My only complaint is this product came with some bloat/crapware along with important Lenovo software--I accidentally uninstalled something thinking it was bloatware only to realize it was a needed file (it was Easy-Camera). Re-downloading the needed software resulted in being given the runaround (in the end, I had to download a Vista version of the program because Windows7-64 bit just wouldn't work with the download). It would be nice if Windows would more clearly specify what's an important file versus what's not (not just specifying for system files) so the laymen out there don't accidentally delete things, but oh well.When the fan blows, it's rather quiet. I haven't had any issues of the laptop overheating. The speed is wonderful, too, very fast. The image quality and sound is pretty good, I haven't had much problems compared to the other reviews. What's also interesting is you have the option to create a face-recognition log-in using the camera instead of signing it; it's a neat touch.For those who use word-processing files, you'll have to either buy Office or go with something like Openoffice instead (the latter of which I did). This laptop also comes with McAfee, which I ditched that in favor of Spybot and Avira; it's best to go with your personal preference for virus/spyware protection.Overall, I'm VERY pleased with the quality of this laptop.

If so, I must have purchased long ago (2005) one of those \"high end\" laptops Model #8922 (Series 3000), a square, rectangular--looks like about a 13\" or 14\" inch--screen. This machine has served me well, and I was able to download the Microsoft Word 2003 from its CD-ROM drive, a smooth and easy program. What disillusioned me with the Lenovo G650 was the \"free\" Microsoft Word 2010 program. I do quite a bit of writing for academic periodicals, both print and and lately on line. But this word processor (2010) is a nightmare for someone who did not go through the sequence of changes from 2003 to the present 2010. (Gradual learning curve) instead of being plunged into the 21st cent.with small prepartion for the \"advances\" in technology, much of which is self-defeating.(Not user friendly)The \"'Easy' Transfer\" of files from the older computer to this new one is a myth. Unless you are a tech mavin you will find this procedure impossibly difficult. You're supposed to use an external drive, a flash drive in my case, insert it into the older laptop, search for an \"Easy Transfer\" icon, or tab--which I couldn't find--then plug it back into the new one. Surprise and shock! When I attempted to download my files from the flash drive to My Docs in the new computer, I found that half my files were wiped out--probably due to the switch from Wind. XP to Wind. 7). I thought I'd try it again with an ancient floppy. But when I later opened up a file, I found to my bewilderment that the text had become an ungodly scramble of cryptographs (Again, Win. 7). Also, when attempting to download a file, or files, a series of windows would appear with a multitude of instructions. It got so that in order to figure out what they meant--I tend to be impatient--one would need a week of tutorials. And I can't afford that luxury. (I'm WWII vet, so time, in my case, is of the essence.) When writing, I type rapidly, and it's very frustrating to type a sentence or two, then have a window come up for no reason at all--maybe I touched the wriong key. But what finally decided me to give up on the G650--which i purchased on line for approx. $400+--is that many of my articles require footnotes. The footnote function on my old Lenovo is a masterpiece of simplicity. On the G650--well, I spent over an hour trying to locate the footnote function. I finally googled to see if there were others who had that problem. One man, who seemed to be far more knowledgeable on computer technology, found himself with the same frustrating barrier. My nephew, some 2000 miles away in Michigan, who's been a computer user since the early DOS , pre internet days, e-mailed me a link that's intended to instruct on the Microsoft Word 2010. But I'm no longer interested in time-consuming experimentation. I've gone back to my earlier square screen workhorse, and will sell the new one to a fellow who's interested. An ddded note. The numlock key numbers are imprinted on the keys of my Lenovo 8922. On the G650, the numlock has a separate keyboard, on the right of the conventional keyboard. I had to cover it with a piece  of cut-to-size cardboard to avoid tapping its keys and creating yet another poroblem, since motor habits hsve become so ingrained into the cerebral cortex that you can't avoid touching that superfluous numlock board. As for Shirley, Shirley, please don't think that all Lenovos are \"poor,\" They are probably still making high end, perfectly good machines. And even this G650 is a good machine, but not for me, an XP, ancient user.I gave it three stars since I average out all of the atars, and came up with approx. three, not becauser the machine itself is so bad (The web pages are fine and my 12 bucks a month aol e-mail format which i downloaded onto it, worked as well as on my older Lenovo. But that Word Pricessor... ?  N'yet!A final PS. This is a problem with many touchpads that make sending e-mails a nightmare--words and characters getting jumbled out of sequence, so that part of a sentence or phrase, ends up in some other part of the e-mail message. But that problem with the G650 becomes an exponential disaster. Another time consuming headache, since you need to go back and move the words and phrases back and fit them into their proper syntactical order. I am typing this in the amazon window, and the errors are typos due to my impatient speed, not a shifting of whole phrases and sentence fragments. But then I'm also typing this on my old PC.", "Date": "May 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worked for less than one year.", "Author": "Vitaliy", "ReviewID": "R2IU0XWF5I9JRU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Hard disk drive failed after 11 months and 3 weeks of use.
