Great value, solid notebook.  Love the keyboard and the access IBM help.  I have called tech support for information and help with software installations and driver updates and they were very good and patient with all my detailed questions.  This is important to me... to have good tech support available. This T41 comes with a 3 year warranty.IBM's website has excellent support.  I love the automated stuff where it analyzes your computer and tells you what updates you need.  Sometimes their driver upgrades are more for the IT person. But, just download their software installer and it works great.  However, you must focus...if you want to understand what you have downloaded.  Not totally for the novice. Tech support walked me thru it once and I was on my way.So far so good after only a month, the T41 rocks!  Particularly the higher-end graphics card, glad I went for that.  I can tell the difference when comparing with my desktop LCD.The CD burner works well and I use Nero 6.  I had been using a 4x burner on my desktop and this one writes at 24x...what a difference.If you are contemplating a notebook, consider this one.  Pay the extra bucks and go with IBM...very glad I did!", "Date": "August 4, 2004"}, {"Title": "It's Fine When It Isn't Broken", "Author": "GA Williams", "ReviewID": "R1RKVF4YUE6C94", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had a T-41 for about two years.  It's been back to IBM three times for new motherboards when the video went out.  It's been back once for a new wireless card.  A second wireless card is coming via delivery service as I type.  This time I get to put it in.I've had several Thinkpads and love their functionality.  IBM's service people are friendly and helpful.  The problem is that I'm getting to know the guys in Atlanta way too well.I asked IBM to replace this T-41 as a lemon. They responded by giving me an extra year of warranty.  That was nice, but every time this thing goes down, it costs me lost time, and for someone who is self employed that is a bad thing.", "Date": "October 31, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent laptop", "Author": "Andrei Soroker", "ReviewID": "R3T4TGKQPAAIN0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Back in 2004 I did quite a bit of research before settling on a T41 (from newegg.com).  I got more RAM for 768M total.  Over four years later it is still going very strong.Great keyboard, light (even today), thin (even today), fairly fast, well-built screen tilting mechanism.  Quiet, doesn't heat up too much.If you're a vi user, you probably won't like the position of the Escape key (you can remap it to F1).It took about three years for the battery to become unusable (I recently got a new one for about[...]).The built-in wireless antenna stopped working and I got a new one from Lenovo support (for free, it was still under the 3-year warranty), but the old one fixed itself as soon as the replacement arrived and has been working now for a few years since.The left 25% of the space bar don't produce a space when pressed --- started happening after around three years.The left button on the lower mouse controls stopped working --- started happening after four years.I've been using a Macbook Pro for work, and every time I open the T41 now, it's such a relief to be able to tilt the screen as far back as I want.", "Date": "January 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent unit, but suffers minor failures often", "Author": "Donald Gillies \"secretbearer\"", "ReviewID": "R1R20XDO3T1XJS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "(a) Best keyboard ever made for laptops, (b) Decent speed, runs Office 2007 O.k., (c) Acceptable graphics (ATI 7500) or good graphics (ATI 9000 / 9600 / FireGL, the latter 2 can play Far Cry 1.0), (d) Thinklight is very useful on overseas plane flights, (e) fits perfectly on all airplane tray tables, (f) Outstanding battery life with CD-battery + 9-cell (5-6 hrs if you dim the screen), (g) It actually sleeps and wakes up properly unlike 50% of all laptops, and (h) You can just grab it and run to a conference room, yanking it out of the minidock, and it will sleep properly, unlike newer (T60, T400) machines where you have to hit a key first !!DONT buy anything with less than 1.8 Ghz processor as the 1.7 Ghz and lower have a smaller cache(2MB vs 3MB) and are about 33% slower.I have used about 4x of these machines at work over the past 6 years.  I just got my 4th machine so each machine lasts about 2 years.  The typical failure is a really bad/sticky key (1st), a failure of some buttons on the synaptics track pad (2nd), a hard drive failure (3rd), or a failure of the power-port male plug, making it difficult (but not impossible) to charge the unit.  With the exception of the hard drive failure, NONE of the failures were catastrophic \"I cannot do any work right now\" type of failures, so the system is robust.The IBM repair manual is fantastic so I buy new parts on ebay and repair it myself.  I've replaced hinges(very hard), screens(very hard), keyboard(easy), touchpad(easy), fans(medium - you need CPU paste).  The keyboard in particular takes 120 seconds to replace as it's just 5 screws and it pops out.", "Date": "May 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Overall lowest cost with proven reliability and quality", "Author": "Henry Ho", "ReviewID": "RXQPDDFXYI6JE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the first ThinkPad I bought for myself, the other three that I have been used in the past eight years were provided by the company I worked for.Decision making was easy:1. Overall lowest cost: after deducted the costs for 3-year warranty, high resolution LCD screen, Windows XP Pro, slim and light-weight design and quality material.2. Proven reliability: this means there won't be extra costs to burden my 3-year ownership.3. Excellent technical support (I called IBM technical support once in August, one month after I got T41, and was surprised that the tech. support rep. picked up the phone right the way and guided me step by step to go through the problem I had. They even followed up with a call to confirm the problem has been solved!Yes, I am more than happy to recommend IBM ThinkPad T41 (2379DJU) to you.

Let me count the ways!I have never had a refurbished machine, so I was wary about glitches and bugs--but when my computer arrived, all my fears were laid to rest. This machine is huge, heavy, and STURDY AS BALLS. This is NOT a hoity-hoity little Macbook air that you're going to be afraid of breaking if you look crossways at it. This, my friends, is a F$#@ing Thinkpad. This guy eats 5 dozen eggs for breakfast. He can lift up a bench with three buxom lasses on it. He uses antlers in all of his decorating. Get the picture? Good.He is HEAVY and HUGE and I have named mine Moose.Now, granted, this is not a guy you can watch movies on, or play games on. This is definitely a computer for writing and surfing the web and basics like that. He CAN stream pandora or another music service, but tends to skip sometimes if you're doing anything else. He has a bit of trouble with flash-heavy webpages, but a good flashblocker add-on can help him with that. Budget your programs with him, don't ask him to do too much. I usually limit myself to a chat program (and I use Trillian 3.1 and AIM 5.9), Word, and Chrome. Definitely use the most streamlined versions of things on this guy, and he'll do you fine.Of course, there is the little matter of you being able to add space, speed, and so on with him. Thinkpads are probably the best kind of machine for upgrading. He's got space for more inside his casing, which is more than you can say for newer machines, that are just meant to be thrown out after a year.Another bonus is the full-size keyboard, the two types of mouse (a touchpad and the pointing stick, the latter of which has a middle button which I'm sure does SOMETHING but I don't know what), the very sturdy mouse-buttons (they're loud but push down satisfyingly), the status lights at the bottom of the monitor, and the little white LED on the top of the monitor, that illuminates the keyboard in the dark. There are also page forward and page back buttons on either side of the up key.I would say that if you're a writer in need of a laptop that'll survive the long haul, or if you're someone who appreciates a machine that will last you years instead of months, get this. Ffs there's a review in here from someone who's had their machine for five years!This guy won't steer you wrong, people.", "Date": "October 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Service", "Author": "Alan", "ReviewID": "RXE0ZT9OW25R5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First unit wouldn't read DVD disks.

Prior to that, we had a Dell - (TERRIBLE) computer, and a Toshiba - (bad) computer.  Our T-41s are still running fine.The T-41's are far superior in reliability.  IBM tech support is also far superior to Toshiba's and (especially) Dell's which was incredibly horrible.T-41's have arguably the best keyboard of any laptop ever.  They are sturdy, lightweight and travel well.  The performance is good - even compared to more modern machines.  We upgraded the hard drive capacity and after installing more memory, the speed increased dramatically.  With added memory, they even run Windoze 7 just fine. Try to get one with the 9,000 series video card.  They have much greater graphics resolution.Our brand-new T-41's cost about $1,400 each back in 2003.  Over the years, the T-41 line has become far less expensive on the used/refurb laptop market.  These computers were built for the corporate market and many of them were leased and returned for refurb.  You can buy one now for about $75-175 used.  That's quite a bargain.  As a result, we bought a few spare identical computers and if we have any problems with one, I just swap the hard drives and I'm back in business in 10 minutes.  That system works very well for us.We wish IBM were still making laptops instead of Lenovo, but it seems as though Lenovo is still maintaining good quality in their new machines.  Tech support is still provided by IBM, and as previously stated, it is truly outstanding and provided by English speaking Americans in Atlanta.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "The worst five pound slab of junk you could ever buy and hopefully never rely upon.", "Author": "Anonymous \"Anonymous\"", "ReviewID": "R1Q4BGUSEYTK6J", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Too bad that IBM (now Lenovo) ThinkPad's have really slid downhill, they break down just for the sport of it, there is growing number of web sites and complainants reporting a growing number of bizarre problems espeically with these older models and the new ThinkPads are getting worse while Lenovo keeps mortgaging their old reputation to command higher prices.The T41-T43's have a particularly stupid vulnerability, the motherboards can permanently fry from inserting a USB device !Hard to believe, but is a known problem (link to the community WiKi in the first comment) and the fix is even stranger if you don't want to keep buying new motherboards, you take a heat gun and \"reflow the motherboard\" after covering most of it aluminum foil.Buying new or used replacement parts for any ThinkPad is just as bad as shopping for antique Porsche parts because the tight knit community overcharges for everything. Thinkpads seem to kill batteries faster than the Arizona summer because I've never managed to get two years out of ThinkPad battery before it reports failures. The fans are noisier than hell and growl worse than horny house cats in the middle of April and those go bad requiring expensive replacements.It's too bad, ThinkPad's used to have legendary quality, they were the only laptops allowed on the International Space Station, IBM made the first tablet computer in the 1990's, these used to be innovators but now they're just the wallet invaders and for most new customers, their first ThinkPad decidedly becomes their last ThinkPad never willing to reconsider the headaches and hassles again.The ThinkPad community is literally guarded by miscreant owners too embarrassed to admit they made a mistake and eager to attack any critic and I expect to see this review attacked and buried in negative votes, that certainty underscores my assertions.Review the immediate comment since Amazon allows external links in comments for the authoritative ThinkPad sites that sheepishly admit just defective these things have become.", "Date": "March 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "JUST WHAT I NEEDED", "Author": "T.
