Ordered this laptop with prime and got it in 2 days. I was going to pull the trigger on the Lenovo website but now I'm glad I didn't. People on the forums are complaining their units kept being delayed... for even months!Okay, lets get into the computer.Un-boxed it, first thing I noticed was how nice it looked out the box, build quality was above average and looked great. Much better than the HP DV6T Quad that I returned due to terrible quality control and build quality on that thing was atrocious!Powered it up and wow the screen is gorgeous. Beautiful glossy display, in FULL HD 1920x1080 of awesomeness. Viewing angles are great, colors pop and blacks are deep making a very rich viewing experience. The screen is very comparable to the DV6T FHD screen which I also loved, viewing angles can't quite match a quality IPS but it's close. This is subjective but one of the main selling points for me would be the gloss screen. Ever wonder why the displays on Macbooks and iMacs ect are so amazing and colors are so rich and vibrant? A big reason for that is the glossy overlay.Keyboard and mouse feels literally 10x better than the DV6T, the touchpad clicks registered nicely, almost Macbook like. The tracking is great, keyboard travel is just right with just the right amount of feedback for you fast typists. Backlit keys are a great feature to have. No complaints here. Love the input combo.Make no mistake by it's appearance on the outside, though it may look like any other normal multimedia laptop, inside is the guts of a MONSTER. This baby will run neck and neck with custom Sager's and Alienwares costing twice as much! Which is amazing since it doesn't weigh 15 lbs, isn't 4 inches thick and doesn't look like a fallen piece from the stealth bomber.This thing rips, it will play literally any new game on High or Ultra settings at full 1080p! With very smooth 30-60fps! It packs a double whammy, Ivy Bridge 3rd Generation Core i7 Quad Processor and a Kepler based GTX660M with 2GB of GDDR5 memory! Throw any project at it, it will churn it up and beg for more.Toss in an open mSATA slot that operates in SATA III 6GB/s and you can stick a 128/256GB mSATA SSD in there as the main duty drive, then use the mechanical drive for all your storage needs. It's a win/win situation! Lesser mortals who are stuck with computers that don't have an mSATA port need to take drastic measures in order to have the same awesome capabilities. Usually needing to remove the optical drive completely in order to replace it with a hard drive caddy, allowing room for their mechanical drive since the original space would be now occupied with a full size SSD.Let's wrap up this review with some straight to the point answers.Does it have USB 3.0? Of course it does!HDMI out? YES!Blu-ray burner? YES!Card reader? YES!Does it really come with a FHD 1920x1080 display? YES! YES! YES!This is the swiss army knife of computers, If I had to write down everything I wanted in a computer, this one would have it all. I would pay twice as much for this system if I needed to, it's really that good! Go buy one yourself, dooooo it!", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "johnboy", "ReviewID": "RFAZLPZMVREBX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This computer is just awesome. It has very nice specs considering the price. Overall, this computer has handled everything I have thrown at it, which includes: Crysis, Ableton, and Photoshop. Aesthetically speaking, this computer looks very nice with it's gunmetal finish, very classy. The screen on this computer is flawless, especially with 1920x1080p. It looks just like the retina display on the new mac book pro. The JBL speakers do nice work to any music (mind you they have actual sub-woofers.) The webcam is also very nice, with a nice 720p output. The i7 processor can be overclocked, which allows it to multitask with easy. I have had no problems with this computer and is a very good competitor to the new mac book pro.

My computer boots in less than a minute and is an absolute powerhouse through games, Blu-rays, and at amazons price which was far below the competition you really can't do better for your money.

It was supposed to be certified to be as good as new. But it arrived with no booklets, disks or any kind of paperwork whatsoever. There were two stickers on the back with Windows product key's on them, but one sticker had been rendered useless with a big black permanent marker x through the key. So, assuming the other sticker was the correct product key, I used that one to try to gain access to the computer. No such luck. I checked and double checked the letters and numbers and it still wouldn't open the computer. So I packed it up and sent it back.In all fairness to Amazon, the amount was credited back into my account very fast.This is a precautionary review. If you order something used from Amazon, it just might not be 'as good as new.'", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "A great gaming laptop", "Author": "Pat", "ReviewID": "R2L4D4DFDBRESH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop after doing some research for laptops tuned toward gaming.  PC Magazine rated this laptop as a top pick and gave it their \"Editor's Choice\" for it's power and capabilities.  I have had this laptop for over 6 months, and I absolutely love it.  The screen resolution (1080p) is fantastic and along with the NVIDIA graphics card provides a crisp and clear visual experience.  The cooling element is nicely designed, with the heat vent on the left side of the computer, allowing the heat of the machine to escape through one vent, thus making the keyboard always cool (This was unlike my old HP laptop, where the heat escaped through the bottom and sides of the laptop, making the keyboard incredibly hot after long gaming sessions).  The keyboard itself is very crispy--my hand freely flows from key to key, and the keys are filled in in-between so no food/dirt/etc. gets underneath the keys, and the keys can be lit up during nighttime.  The only real complaint I have is the trackpad.  The right and left keys on the track pad are like an Apple laptop, where they are embedded within the trackpad itself (there is a faint visible line that separates the right and left keys, unlike an Apple laptop.  However, I wouldn't not buy this laptop because of this (I also personally use an external mouse).  On another note, I recently did a complete factory restore (to clear a lot of program clutter I had) and I found it incredibly easy to do.  You simply hit the One-Touch Recovery button, hit accept and the laptop takes care of the rest.If you're looking to purchase a gaming laptop, I would highly recommend this one.  I would also recommend buying it here, off Amazon.  Lenovo's website store seems to be incredibly slow.  When I originally went to place my order with Lenovo, the site said the laptop would SHIP in 3 weeks.  Here on Amazon, it shipped the day after I purchased it, and arrived in 2 days.", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Greaaat laptop", "Author": "O. A.

Worst than that is the power supply connector ... it looks and feels SO FRAGILE ... instead of using a stronger one or having the connector in the back, Lenovo decided to put the connector on the right hand side of the laptop.

Praise worthy, that's for sure, great durability, reliability, and construction is far superior in my opinion to other brands, which seem like toys when I test them in stores.  It is not light weight in the usual sense, but i wouldn't call it heavy either.  I always take it in a padded leather briefcase built for it and the charger and the materials for external mouse, so, it is no benefit to me to have it be lighter.  I won't it to travel with all its gear anyway, I use my iPad on planes and places that would be needing light weight stuff.

I actually enjoyed lenovo's energy management app and have been using it for over a year.My only gripe about this is the build quality. I had a dead pixel right off the bat, but there's no way I'd wait for a return. Another dead pixel or two popped up over my year of using the laptop. Tonight the LCD completely went out\u2014a month out of warranty\u2014and I am stuck replacing it for around $85 (incl. shipping).I'm a programmer by trade, so I often have my hands 10 and 2 on the keyboard. After a few months of using the laptop, my palms had worn down the exterior's nice black finish to a dirty gray tone.This thing feels pretty hefty, so I'm often concerned when picking it up with one hand. I can hear the laptop's plastic giving little creaks sometimes. It's not something I expected for the price I paid.Furthermore, with one little accident, the battery's clips completely broke off. I now have to avoid putting any pressure on the battery for fear of it dislodging.Like I said, the specs you're getting for the price is outstanding. But if I had to do it again (and I probably will soon, this thing is on its last leg) I'd trade some specs for better build quality.

Then turned the Blue-Ray into an external usb3.0 drive so that it can play with my laptop when i need to watch something or install some software.Screen resolution is awesome. The video card is Great. No complaints there as it is in a laptop. The audio is great for a laptop.The battery is ok. I've heard that you can switch out the cd drive for a battery pack but i have yet to find one.BIG con: the wireless card isn't the best.

I was unable to resolve the problems described below & ended up buying a Lenovo Y500 (I'm not a Lenovo devotee; the value/price/performance is right for me). 18 years of repairing computers (HP, Dell, IBM/Lenovo, Sony, Toshiba, Gateway/e-Machines, Samsung) has taught me that no manufacturer (most & least reliable I've encountered were both IBM laptops) makes a great (I'm talking long term reliability, not \"on paper\" specs) machine every time, so I buy the best value that meets my current needs regardless of the OEM.Things to consider when evaluating a Lenovo Y580:-Y580 has the higher performance GeForce GTX660 vs Y500's GeForce 650 but most Y500's have (Ultrabay) dual/SLI video cards included-Y500 is actually a newer model than the Y580 (same form factor)-looks like the entire \"Y\" series from Lenovo only include 5400RPM (no 7200RPM) HDD's-Y500 has \"Ultrabay\" allowing swapping of the extra GPU with a fan, optical drive, 2nd HDD (cursory search can't find any for sale though)-1366x768 res or 1920x1080 (uncommon for a 15.6\" screen laptop)-Blu-Ray or DVD options (couldn't find any Y500's with any optical drive)-white (Y580) or red (Y500) keyboard backlightingI'm relating my experience primarily to inform people of the \"solution\" (read the last paragraph) Lenovo presented to me to \"fix\" my Y580. I believe this is potentially a solid value in a gaming laptop as long as you don't have to deal with their tech support.The machine worked fine during normal computing but problems appeared when I started trying to play games requiring 3D acceleration. I believe it was continuing to use the integrated graphics card & wasn't auto-switching (should be seamless) to the nVidia GPU as it should have. I tried Borderlands 2, Saints Row the Third, Dungeon Defenders, Left 4 Dead (1). Since I don't see reports of similar problems from others (Amazon & other sites with reviews), I suspect I got an isolated defective machine.Problems I encountered with ALL the games I tried: flickering \"sparks\", 5-60+ second pauses (not frame rate drops), freezes (switching to task manager & back would sometimes unfreeze the game), unexpected game close with: \"graphics card has stopped responding & recovered\", Win8 equivalent of BSOD's (a sad face).I used the convenient one button \"restore\" feature (to restore Win8 to factory condition) twice while self troubleshooting (so I KNOW the software was Lenovo standard) before calling Lenovo for help.After some moderately helpful (professional, friendly; acknowledged that there was a problem & that I'd need higher level tech support) but ultimately fruitless troubleshooting, I was referred (had to dial another number; no direct/warm transfer) up the tech support path to someone who after more fruitless help blamed the problem on the fact that I was trying to run games.He told me that, since it was a software problem, I'd need to call another number. He was confident that they'd be able to solve my problem in under an hour by changing some settings in Windows & it would only cost $60 an hour to fix my machine so that I'd be able to play games on my new gaming laptop. Paying $60/hour (it may have been $59 or $59.99) is unacceptable to make a gaming laptop capable of playing games. The Y580 met all my requirements (1080 res, Blu-Ray, gaming GPU; I compromised the 17\" screen) so I would have exchanged it but the seller was out & discontinuing the Y580.", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "It is an awesome laptop!", "Author": "Tyler D.

At first, I wasn't sure about this model because there is contradictory information regarding the max screen resolution. Product summary says it is 768p while product description states it is 1080p FHD. Amazon support was pretty much useless and had no answer and only said I could order it and if I did not like it, I could return it. Not an option for me since I do not live in the US (I live in Mexico), but a friend traveled for a week and was going to be my courier. Anyway, I decided that with or without the FHD screen, this was going to be worth every penny so I purchased it.When I finally received it, first thing I checked was the screen. IT IS ACTUALLY 1080P FHD!!! So I can finally rest in peace. Another thing that surprised me (again, because Amazon's info was not that accurate), is that apparently this baby has a Blu-ray writer. I have not tested it yet, here in Mexico is hard to find write-able BR discs. Anyway, if it is not I do not care too much.Let's talk about performance. This laptop is a beast; Skyrim automatically set its defaults to ultra settings. Screen is gorgeous, trackpad is ok to me, I really like it, but might be because I have not played with a macbook pro (people say y580's is cheap compared to MBP). Keyboard is also good and the backlight is a good addition. Be aware of 2 things: this model only has 2xUSB 3.0 ports and the rest are 2xUSB 2.0, apparently this is due to being one of the early builds from Lenovo (later models offer 3x3.0 & 1x2.0), but again, not a big deal to me since I can probably buy a port replicator and add more external drives. Probably the only downside of this laptop is the lack of the mSATA drive already installed with Windows running from it. It features a 750GB 5400RPM drive which limits Windows performance a bit. You can get an mSATA SDD (up to SATA 3) and do a clean installation of windows by yourself to boost up performance. I bought an mSATA II 64GB kingston drive that I have to yet install myself (also no screws included, you need to get those yourself probably from an old laptop, look around for M2x2mm screws). Only reason why I have not done that myself is because I am really lazy and have not found a really good guide for a fresh install specific to this model.Overall I am really satisfied with this laptop, and for the price I will definitely recommended for anyone who wants a gaming laptop at a low price.3 stars on my review, because Amazon lost 1 star for not providing accurate information, and 1 star less because of the performance drop due to the 5400 HDD drive.", "Date": "August 11, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0084C2ZR2"}}
