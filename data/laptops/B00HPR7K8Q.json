The Keyboard feel is just off my hand never felt comfortable on it.I'm a trackpoint user and the buttons and the replace the dedicated button with a touch clicky touchpad (all in one button). The response it absolutely the worst. Lenovo if you read this \"GO BACK TO DEDICATED BUTTONS\"Summary.If you get this Thinkpad get an external keyboard and mouse!!! For all it good points, this is the worst Thinkpad I've ever had (I've had 750, 770, T40, T60 & W510). The keyboard basically kills the overall rating I have for this machine.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Up to expectations!", "Author": "Nandan B.", "ReviewID": "R2LFCKL6MXUYOP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am pretty satisfied with my purchase. I was planning to go for the W530 given its robustness and positive ratings but the only reason I did not go for the W530 was because of the generation gap between the Core i7 and Nvidia graphics card processors.Pros:Very powerful processor and graphics card. I upgraded my RAM to 16 GB and my simulations work seamlessly without hiccups.Good design and definitely better looking than the W530.Battery life is pretty good.Laptop screen is very soothing to the eye with a HD resolution.Cons:The trackpad is extremely non user-friendly. I had read a lot of reviews about this laptop having a bad trackpad but I believe one can do with it. If you are a visualization person (CAD, CATIA or someone who needs a lot of visualization), you definitely need a mouse.Overall, I love this laptop as it is serving my purpose well and I personally haven't had any trouble with the keyboard (there are a lot of reviews which heavily criticize the keyboard).I would say, go for it!", "Date": "February 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worst touchpad ever!!!", "Author": "EC", "ReviewID": "R2IVEEAEEN555J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received the W540 as my work machine.Pros:- It turns on- Performance is good with i7vpro- Battery life is very goodCons:- The touchpad renders the machine nearly unusable for me. I don't like having to plug in an external mouse just to use the laptop.  The touchpad is one large button that clicks when you push on it.  If you use Excel heavily as I do, you will likely need some counseling and medication from the frustration.- Machine is very heavy- Power supply is massive- No HDD activity light- No wifi switchOverall, ThinkPad isn't what it used to be.

Do your homework and test out the laptop in a store before you pump your $$$ into this horrible machine.The specs are fine, keyboard is great and display is hands down awesomeness. All of this just evaporates when you get started with the track pad. Absolute worst experience trying to scroll / right click or even just click on stuff. There is just one square and it will frustrate the heck out of you when you try to get things done!!Stay very far away from this one and get other models which have better trackpads.", "Date": "May 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worst ThinkPad yet", "Author": "Alex Daniels", "ReviewID": "RIWO6KS7FJ68W", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After 3 months of ownership of a custom direct ordered W540, I'd say many of the things that made ThinkPads special has been spoilt in this latest version.KeyboardMany people don't like the keyboard.  Personally I'd like it if they made the key action like the \"Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard for Business\", but that would offend the ThinkPad purists.  The key action I can live with but the keyboard layout is not good for writing code, where you need to be able to find the arrow, end, home and delete buttons by touch.MouseThis is one of the most offensive changes with respect to old ThinkPad erongomics.  There are no dedicated keys for the touch point mouse control.  You press the trackpad and depress the whole thing.  It's horrible, creates a constant battle of mishits and for the first time over a decade of ThinkPad use, I *must* take a mouse on the road.  Ergonomics, durability and premium design are supposed to be what ThinkPads are all about, and it fails terribly.Quality (lack of)Both factory direct W540's I took delivery of were DOA.  I got one repaired at a service center (faulty memory).  They seem to have a real problem.  They've also skimped on durability - there's too much case flex and a huge amount of screen flex.  This is not the premium builds of old.All the other complaints you read are true also: crazy light leakage from the backlit keys,What's Still Good:3K Display, CPU, trackpoint, Lenovo update, Lenovo hardware tear-down manuals.If I were a corporate buyer, I'd check out the other manufacturers laptop-workstation offerings because there seems to be little benefit with paying a premium for a ThinkPad.Won't someone create a laptop built for serious content creators who must be mobile? - there's a gap opening up in the market.", "Date": "May 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Laptop", "Author": "Bowen Jia", "ReviewID": "RXMKFS0T5J59I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "High resolution screen is very good and the weight of laptop is much lighter than my previous one (R400).New keyboard is comfortable.", "Date": "April 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "a real step down", "Author": "Karl Johnson", "ReviewID": "RFN3CHAMLG15I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "No indicator lights for any functions (hdd, battery, power, num/caps lock) funky trackpad, slick keys, The 530 was a much better designed laptop.
