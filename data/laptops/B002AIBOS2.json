It is also very useful for studies as it has a 4-5 hour battery life. I found it amazing to take notes with and all of it's features are pretty useful.Yes, this laptop may be outdated in this time, but at a 5.5 Windows Index Rating (at least that's what mine said) it is not weak in this performance dominant environment. Of course that depends on what you plan to do with this laptop. I have used it for editing videos and capturing gameplay, and I am pleased with the results.If you want a high performance computer, I would suggest building one, but this was such a good laptop for the price that I don't care what other people think. Need a good laptop for medium performance and fluid interface? This one is for you!", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Jeff Bollinger \"jeff\"", "ReviewID": "RBDJVM3OVUOHF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this about 4 years ago brand new and it has been great for me. 1080p is bright and beautiful. The performance was great at first and is a little slower now because of the things I do now require a but more power.

I can play Sims 3 Fallout3, Elderscrolls Oblivion, etc. with no problems.Only the cg demos in Supreme Commander 2 have a slight slowdown.The price at the time was only $866 with windows 7 Home Premium.  Dell has great deals compared to HP.Anywho.... It's a great gaming computer for any hardcore gamer.Now I am having trouble getting the bluetooth function to work for me, but with the usb, hdmi, sata, SD, and Eithernet plug-ins, I don't need another computer for work or gaming.", "Date": "July 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Complete ripoff", "Author": "Danny", "ReviewID": "R3LX3J2EKAJVQX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Have had this laptop for a couple years now, and have had nothing but trouble.

I basically bought this for english class. I used it for a million other things since I spent so much. The only regret is that for strictly school purposes I think the smaller 13\" would have been optimal, this 16\" is a beast.Overall, I still prefer to use my desk top; I crammed an xps into an inspiron quad. So from dell mine MSRP something close to $2000. I bought this one and fought for the price until I got my studio xps, a mini 10, and a 19\" monitor for $1350 delivered in 2 days and nice warranties. student discount is 7%. the six cell battery only lasts 3 hours, buy an additional 9 cell. it only has 2 usb ports-that is very retarded. comes in cool packaging.Every time I pull it out or let someone use it, I get compliments.", "Date": "November 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Got it yesterday, everything I wanted", "Author": "Fnorgby \"Fnorgby\"", "ReviewID": "R2MGCES86Q5CP3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, let me say that I love dells.  This is the 3rd laptop that I've owned, not counting the three I used in corporate life.  I upgraded from a 1330, which I lo-ho-hoved, but gave to a family member when I needed to upgrade for school.  I've heard recently that Dell has acknowledged big problems with their line of desktops from the early to mid 00's.  My experience with and love for Dells comes from their big iron type servers and laptops.  I've very little exposure to the desks that had the problems.  Also, this is a preliminary review given that I jut got it yesterday.The keyboard is very good for me (I have very big fingers), typing is smooth and fluid.  The screen is bright and crystal clear (I have the 1080i screen).  I've used most of the subsystems (except bluetooth and esata) and had no problems.  I've got it hooked to my 40\" LCD tv via HDMI and have good sound and picture.There is surprisingly little bloatware.  It comes with a dell-branded Stardock, which works kinda like the mac dock, which I'm keeping for now.  It has a free ad-supported version of MS Office and Excel, with no activation required.  I'll be upgrading to student ed. because I need OneNote, but the free versions work great.  It has a one-year macafee license, but I have a personal license to kaspersky so I'll be switching over.  It has some game software from WildTangent, which I'll uninstall sight unseen.  I'm a gamer, but I hate WT service.There is a dell datasafe service, haven't used yet.  Bluetooth drivers (ditto), facial recognition software (still in learning mode), webcam drivers, Flash helper, powerDVD.  I removed Acrobat and installed Foxit, plus I've installed Vuze, KMPlayer, 7zip, xvid codecs, firefox, daemon tools lite, WinDirStat (must have!), and autoruns (must must must have).  With all this, taskman reports 1.45 gb of memory in use.  Not great but not bad.My xps 16 has 6 GB, 320gb 7200 rpm drive, ATI 5730 1GB, i7 Q720 CPU, 1080i screen, bluetooth.  As configured, it came to $1450 from dell's website (there was a $250 discount at the time).  It gets Experience Index score of 5.9, which is .1 higher than my desktop (4 gb, AMD 9850 quad, nvidia 8800 GT, 7200 rpm drives -- a 3 yr old desktop but still highly competent for gaming).I'm a sweaty type person, but the wrist rest part of the keyboard doesn't smudge as much as the 1330 laptop did.  Touchpad is medium sized, very lightly textured.  Buttons work -- all moot since I'll be using a bluetooth mouse almost exclusively.Only 4 stars since to be fair I've only had it one day.  It's exactly what I wanted, though, and I'm excited as all get-out to get cozy and familiar with it.  Lots and lots of typing to do -- starting law school in 4 weeks :-/", "Date": "July 8, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002AIBOS2"}}
