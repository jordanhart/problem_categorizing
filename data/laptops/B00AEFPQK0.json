{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Ultrabook!", "Author": "beelzebub", "ReviewID": "RS3PHPG9TPWMH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This ultrabook is incredibly thin and light & has a smaller footprint than most 13\" laptops - so it is perfect for the person on the go.  Even tho this is last year's model w/ Win7 & 2nd generation processor, it is still plenty fast.  The carbon fiber bottom keeps it cool & the backlit keyboard is very handy.  Seem to get about 6 hours of battery life and the tiny ac adapter charges it relatively quick.The screen resolution is on the lackluster side but they did release a HD version this year for those who want it.  The mouse clicker is a tad on the loud side but so far no real complaints.Great ultrabook at an incredible price if you do not mind not having the latest greatest tech.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "The perfectly sized computer", "Author": "Frances S.
