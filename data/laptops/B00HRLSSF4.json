This laptop is more like a first computer, a backup computer, or even a laptop for grandparents.", "Date": "June 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great computer, Great Price", "Author": "Cindy Marie", "ReviewID": "R1IKXOHXH10RMI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love the look, the ten key, everything but I wish it had 6 mg memory. great price for this computer though.", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "No Dvd Rom", "Author": "trisa raiford", "ReviewID": "R1N1T1EJB6HBR9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was disappointed when i find out that i did not have a DVD ROM drive or what ever you call it I have to buy one and i think that is a waste of money for me I would like to know if I could send it back and get another one.", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "okay?", "Author": "Shegwa725", "ReviewID": "R7P5DNZM5QZ7F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It was great the first few weeks I got it except for some reason I couldn't use hands free mode, but I was okay with that.
