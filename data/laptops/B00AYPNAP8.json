{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome Laptop for a very good price", "Author": "Perry", "ReviewID": "RZ81YDX69PK4B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been searching and researching for a good Laptop for awhile now and I had a few requirements for it to meet my needs and truly replace my desktop.1. The laptop had to have a real video card in it as the Intel HD 4000 wasn't going to cut it replacing my GT 650 Desktop GPU.2. I wanted a backlit keyboard so I could use it in any lighting condition without issue.3. It had to be a 1080P screen or higher and I wanted a 15\" to 17\" and obviously, the larger the better (not keeping the desktop or the monitor).4. Selling my Desktop had to pay for almost half of it.  In my research I wavered back and forth over buying the Lenovo Y500 with Dual GT 650 GPUs and decided against that as Lenovo doesn't have the highest build quality.  Then I looked at a 17.3\" Acer V3-771G with a GT730 GPU and Core i5 CPU but, the screen was only 720P and the keyboard wasn't backlit so, even though the $700 price tag was attractive, it wasn't really suitable for my needs.Finally, I settled on paying the extra money for the G75VW-BHI7N07 and I'll elaborate as to why below.PROCESSING POWER  I really wanted the laptop to have at least a quad core CPU but, given that GPUs are the really stars of the modern PC, I was okay with settling for a dual core I7.  This was okay in 2 of the models (Y500 and G75VW) because they were at least an i7 and both were Quad Core CPUs and both were using the 3630QM model so that was a wash.Only the Acer didn't measure up here.GRAPHIC PROCESSING POWER  One of the things I do with my desktop is Bluray Ripping and another is Gaming...  Both of these functions would only be satisfied by a solid GPU.With the Y500 there was no doubt that the Dual GT 650 SLI would handle my needs and honestly, it is better than the GTX 660M by a good 20 to 25 percent but, with that performance also comes heat.With the GTX 660M in the G75, it wasn't the fastest GPU but, watching reviews it did the job quite well and it ran cooler with less enegry than the Y500 solution.  Essentially, this likely improves the longevity of the laptop and people want a reliably machine.Again, the ACER V3-771 didn't measure up as the GT730 was the worst performer on the bunch and only about 40% improvement over the Intel HD 4000.KEYBOARD AND TRACKPADThe Acer was said to be a very comfortable option for the keyboard and the trackpad was said to be very reliable so, this is certainly a strength for the system but, it lacked back lighting and that was one of my requirements so this laptop was really losing its luster.The G75VW was said to have the best keyboard of the bunch with its firm chicklet styling and 3 levels of back light to satisfy pretty much any need.  The track pad has been decent but, a little finicky at times but, still pretty good over all.The Y500 had many complaints about the track pad that were said to have been fixed early in 2013 and while the keyboard had a cool red glow to the back light, the keyboard is a little too spongy for my taste and this is a build quality issues so, it is  knock against the Lenovo.SCREEN  The screen on the Acer again, didn't quite measure up as it had a max resolution of 1600x900 so my 1080P was out the window but, it probably allowed the GT 730M to keep up given the reduced resolution.The screen on the Y500 is only 15.6\" but, it is 1080P.  The biggest issue with this display are viewing angles that alter the clarity of the image when not looking at it straight on.  Over all, it wasn't a bad option.The G75VW on the other hand has a really vibrant and colorful LED backlit screen that is 1080P and is a Matte (Anti-Glare) screen which more than does the trick.  The viewing angles only suffer minimal distortion beyond 40 degrees so you're okay to really work on the laptop for day to day usage.  This was by far the best option of the three screens.AESTHETICS  Obviously, the Acer is proving that it isn't even in the same class as the other two and this area isn't really going to win any medals.  Basically, it is a good solid laptop for the lower mid range of laptops.The Y500 certainly packs a ton of options and features both Bluetooth and SLI which the G75VW has neither.  This is still a very strong competitor but, upgrading the laptop isn't very flexible.The G75VW has one very big advantage here because, the GPU is actually on an MXM Card so theoretically, the GPU and CPU as well as the hard drives and wireless card or DVD RW can all be upgraded.  This is actually very cool because it might be possible to extend the life of the laptop with upgrades later on down the line.BUILD QUALITYThe Acer is a decent and improving build but, it isn't really top of the line here so, yeah, this machine is about out of gas.The Y500 has a disadvantage in that my company uses Lenovo and far too many of those laptops break so, I cannot imagine using a consumer line would be much better in build quality and I didn't want to risk it.The G75VW's design and build quality are excellent and the cooling system is known for being the best in any laptop design.  Looking under the hood reveals some really intelligent design decisions and some very impressive engineering.  In short, this is clearly the winner here.COOLING  Cooling is a big deal because, the cooler your laptop runs, the more longevity it has, and the better it performs.Obviously the Acer doesn't generate the heat of the other laptops as it isn't running the same high end hardware so, it should last awhile if the build quality holds up.The Lenovo runs dual 650M GPUs in SLI mode and this results in operating temps a good 50% or higher than the G75VW.  Also, the main cooling vent for the Lenovo is on the bottom of the laptop and although people say it does fairly well, it is still subject to the main problems that other laptops have.Now the ASUS G75VW features a revolutionary split cooling system (one fan for the GPU and one for the CPU, spread over opposite ends of the laptop) much like the MacBook Pro of recent years but, it goes one step further by venting the heat out the back and more upward so, you can actually use this Laptop on a blanket and it will not get much hotter than on a flat surface.  Another note, the laptop is designed to keep the CPU and GPU running extremely cool even under heavy loads.  In short, the life of this beauty should be very long.CONCLUSIONThe Acer just didn't cut it even though it is still a quality laptop, it just didn't meet my needs.The Y500 was very tempting but, the 15.6\" screen and my history of dealing with newer Lenovo laptops really pushed this closer to the ACER than the G75vw.The G75VW has way too much going for it and the short comings have strengths as well.  I would like to have had bluetooth but, the laptop doesn't feature it and adding it is actually pretty simple with a usb dongle.Honestly, I considered a MacBook Pro as well but, that was 2x the price for less performance than the Y500 and the and the G75VW.", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "This thing is a beast!", "Author": "Chris Meirose \"Big Chris\"", "ReviewID": "R3K6Y1MW36HA7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Upon receiving this laptop I added an additional 8GB of RAM and an additional 1TB hard drive for data.I love the initial setup.  No bloatware.  My first impression upon opening the box was - wow, this thing is a beast.  It's quite heavy and feels far more sturdily constructed than the HP DV-7 I'm replacing.  The exterior has a textured rubberized coating that looks really cool, though is a bit of a headache when putting it into my backpack for travel because of how grippy the rubber is so it doesn't slide in smoothly like another smooth exterior laptop would.  Very minor issue.  And that and the overall weight are literally the only criticism I can offer.I love the 2nd hard drive bay.  I love the HUGE capacity for RAM - ships with 8GB and has two easily accessible slots for more.  I love that I can open this up and clean out the fan filters.  The fans are whisper quiet even when running fairly hard.  Screen is crisp and clear, and the video is the best I've seen on a laptop.  I haven't yet bench marked mine, but I'm expecting pretty impressive numbers.Keyboard is very comfortable for typing - offers no flex at all.  Back lit keys is a nice option as well.  The only thing I think I'd add is a physical button above the touch pad to turn it off for when I'm doing a lot of typing. My hand regularly brushes the pad and it is incredibly sensitive.Now that I've got it set up and adapted a bit, I do actually like Windows 8 that it ships with.  Takes some getting used to, and with a bit of modding I've managed to make it look more like the Win7 that I'm more familiar with.The integrated camera is quite clear and the microphone(s) pick up sound very well for things like Skype.All in all I think this is a great deal for a whole lot of laptop!", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Computer but no Buetooth", "Author": "V.

I read that the computer had Bluetooth only to find out to my disappointment this unit does not. Some models do not have Bluetooth :(.  The computer itself is awesome and I have to say this laptop remains cool to the touch even on the bottom and when playing Skyrim.  It was also disappointing to see that the ROC Gaming mouse was not included which I also read was included but then after reading some other reviews, I found they discontinued providing the mouse even though the drivers and app is installed.  Those are the only two issues I have found.  It took some time to get used to WIN 8 without a touch screen, but I am getting around fine after two weeks of owning this awesome machine.  The computer starts up fast and is so quiet.  The spec for this affordable laptop will play a game like Skyrim under High settings so enjoy that gamers.  All in all I wished it had the mouse and Bluetooth that I thought I was getting but I can purchase a mouse so the Bluetooth is my only issue.", "Date": "May 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Gaming laptop on a budget", "Author": "Ian", "ReviewID": "R12TVMDDX2NAON", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This specific laptop covered all my needs for the perfect gaming experience on a budget.
