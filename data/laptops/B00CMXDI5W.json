It boots up in seconds and is ready to do a good days work or play. I did install word (work and my writing require it), but other than that I was working on it within 8 minutes. (I'm slow, LOL) The screen is amazing and the picture quality is as well. This is one of the best laptops I have ever used and will buy another one when this one gets to old.

Just a little different from the old one.", "Author": "Eugene F. McCarthy Jr", "ReviewID": "RY7HH9ZOJQK8M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this unit! I changed from a Dell which I am sick of! This is so much easier to use and Samsung has some of their own features that make it worth every penny. On the down side, it has a feature on the touch pad that you can change screens by sliding your finger from the outside edge. I find this to be a pain as another screen will pop up if I go to far over from the center of the touch pad. the only other thing I would have REALLY liked is a back lit keyboard! I can deal with the touch pad issue but the Non-Backlit keyboard is the only thing that kept me from giving this a 5 star rating.I would still HIGHLY recommend this unit and the Samsung brand! Outstanding product and quality made! Really worth it!", "Date": "October 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Handy PC to have around.", "Author": "Doug Hibbard", "ReviewID": "R1JAXAFHZ6VPAW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far, this PC has been a great boon in our family. My wife uses it for her video-conferencing and web-publishing work.Here's what we see:1. Speed of PC. It's got good speed, even running Windows 8.1. (I'm not going to review Win8. I miss Windows 3.1 and DOS 6.2. I liked those.) Overall, the processing power is capable of running a video conference while also having open note-taking programs and powering the bluetooth adapter for the headset.2. Battery life. Unplugged and in-use, 4 hours. That's of constant use for word-processing, web editing, and email.3. Samsung start menu program. It works great, and helps find those things that we used to know where they were, back in XP and Win7.4. USB Ports: plenty of them, enough to tag in everything we use.5. Optical drive built-in. What can I say? I like that, I need it.6. Trackpad has good response to it.7. Video rendering is excellent, as is the audio.The biggest complaint I would make is reducing the Audio Jacks to a 1-plug system. I don't have a single-plug headset for headphones and mic--I have to choose which to plug in, and I'd rather use both.In all, while there's no included software, I haven't needed it. The hard drive is big enough for Win8 and LibreOffice for processing.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Computer itself is great.", "Author": "Eggmom", "ReviewID": "R14SPLWVIXT5X2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like the computer.  It's fast enough and light enough for me.  After Samsung came out with the a start button, I began to like it a little better.  I never use the Win 8 desktop where all those big, senseless icons are.  I haven't learned how to make it stop popping on and bothering me.  I plan to do that when I have the time.  I don't know what Microsoft was thinking.  Those of us who don't like touchscreen on our laptops have no use for it.  I heard that Win 8.1 put the start button back on it.", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good", "Author": "Marcus Vinicius Rabelo da Silva", "ReviewID": "R2POJ9YRNH5JWA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very good considering specifications, the only problem is that this model doens't have USB 3.0 =/, however I recommend it.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Upgrade for me", "Author": "Gramma Linda", "ReviewID": "RNLSOCJHCE0CY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The last time I bought a laptop was with windows vista so this was quite an upgrade, Windows 8 is amazing once you get accustomed to using it. This laptop doesn't have a touch screen and windows 8 is best used with just that, a touch screen. However it is possible to adjust to using it with the mouse pad. The laptop itself arrived programmed with the cursor very sensitive in that every little touch would open a window not intended to be explored. I had to actually read the instructions to discover the sensitivity of it is adjustable. When first used, you cannot be in a hurry to use this laptop. You need time to sit with it and get to know all of it's abilities.Take time to get to know its functions and soon you will be cruising thru windows 8 like a pro, As far as speed goes I thought my internet provider was the reason my former laptop ran so slow. I was wrong. I am using the same provider with this laptop and it is triple the speed!

When I bought this \"new\" laptop, I was excited when it came in the mail. Excited and anxious because the shipping took forever, even though I paid for expedited shipping. They earn their one star when customer service issued me a $12 refund because of how long the shipping took.I'm not new to computers and electronics and have set up new laptops many times before. Something was unique and \"off\" about this particular one. When I did the initial install there were tons of updates to do and it kept saying the settings wouldn't install. I contacted Samsung directly and they said the graphics card didn't seem to be original either. Something wasn't right.I requested a refund after having the laptop for 2 days. I sent it back and packed it beautifully. There were no damages to it. I got charged a 20% restocking fee, which was $160 dollars!!", "Date": "June 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best laptop for the money", "Author": "Jerry  Hop", "ReviewID": "R37CJQBM7SUR39", "Overall": "5.0",
