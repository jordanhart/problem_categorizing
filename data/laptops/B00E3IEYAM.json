It's fine for what it is, it is occasionally choppy playing 1080p videos on sites (not sure if it was the internet. it's possible)Here's the drawbacks I've found:The RAM is soldered to the motherboard, so no upgrading it (much to my dismay).No CD Drive. Doesn't bug me much. I already had an external DVD burner.The brick is annoying as all get out. Can occasionally use THREE outlets if you have the all in a row kindThe Ethernet socket has a spring loaded part that closes when not plugged in. The spring that holds it broke within two weeks.I push the part back in to where it stays to prevent it being ripped out. If it gets ripped out, you can't plug Ethernet inMouse pad is pretty bad. Software right click means half the time it will right click when you want to left click, and left click when you REALLY want to right click.Windows 8 Sucks out of the box, 8.1 makes it pretty nice (I have no complaints)the good:I get 4-4.5 hours of battery with 7 chrome tabs, my IRC client, skype and Trillian running.The system resumes quick from standby, boots reasonably fast (I've seen more expensive laptops boot slower),Keyboard is good when you get used to it.All in all for the $350 I paid for it, I like it.", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your time and money", "Author": "Mike's Girl", "ReviewID": "R36CWWWBQ59LJS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Owned this computer for only two months and I'm having to send it back in for the second time. First time was for a bad mother board that broke on me after only 10 days, now it's the hard drive that went out. That plus horrible Windows 8, I've spent more time frustrated with this computer or having it fixed then actually getting to enjoy it.
