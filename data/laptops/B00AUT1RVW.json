{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Ultrabook first, tablet second, but a great machine nonetheless!", "Author": "A. Celen", "ReviewID": "R1VQG2BZJG7ARV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "== First things first ==My wife has been looking for a laptop to replace her old Vaio SZ (very nice laptop, still lighter than many and lasted her 5 years!). She was a little picky when it comes to aesthetics and didn't like Macbooks, so it took us a while to find a good looking and solid Windows laptop. So we were looking for a laptop that:- is good looking as in the design not being an afterthought but a part of the whole package- has a quality screen with above average resolution (average as in 1366x768, which comes with even some 15\" laptops for heaven's sake!)- is light but well built and durable- has less optical drives and more space for battery instead, so that it can last a while (more than 5 hrs would be good)- has a large and smooth track pad (hopefully with not-so-horrible multi-touch support, as I got used to see in even high-end PC hardware)- has a 180 degree tilt-able screen like her old Vaio SZ (not sure why this is a requirement, but I know better not to ask too much at this point)- has enough power to support daily tasks (she is not a gamer, so an i3-5 with integrated graphics should be fine)- has an SSD (best thing happened to laptops since sliced bread with some PB & J: well worth real-world-not-just-benchmark performance gains and more portability)So we finally settled with Yoga. And lo and behold, Yoga ticks all of the boxes above, only coming slightly behind modern Vaio Z in looks (Yoga's processor is good enough, thank you very much), but hey, this is a Lenovo quality Ultrabook slash Tablet that is built for Windows 8 not just compatible, has a *touch screen* and we have $600 left we can use on something else.We bought ours from BestBuy for ~$1000 the week it came out (wasn't on Amazon yet). Ours is the gray version with i5 processor and a 128G SSD. Along with 3 years in-home repair + accidental damage protection for just $220 that I bought from Lenovo directly. Man, that is not even close to what I would have paid for a similar warranty coverage with Dell or HP or most anyone else as far as I know.Now, on to the more specific points:== Pros ==- Very good display!It has an IPS panel (go look it up if you don't know how good that is) with a sharp looking 1600x900 resolution (good enough for a 13\") with *very* goodviewing angles (can't get colors to wash up no matter where I look at it). Don't let the resolution frenzy trick you; this is a laptop, not a smartphone, and while Windows 8 apps (Metro apps) are resolution agnostic, regular Windows desktop doesn't play well with high DPI screens unless you like looking at tiny icons all day long (in short hi-res with regular Windows is good when you have a 27\" monitor, not so much when you have a 13\" laptop)- Touch screen is a lot better than expectedThere was never a moment when the screen missed a touch or couldn't handle multi-finger gestures. It even has these nice little dots or trails that show up where you touch or drag, so you know if it is the screen that is unresponsive or the app (it happens, not all applications respond to touch well, especially gestures). Touch scrolling is even smoother than touchpad scrolling, which is why my wife prefers to move things around by touch instead of using touchpad/keyboard combo.- Nice and sturdy double-hinge designWhen I first saw the Yoga I though \"That's a very elegant way to break your screen\" but boy was I wrong. Right now the hinges are proving to be stiff enough to hold the screen in any position without being uncomfortable or giving out. Time will tell but right now it seems like job well done, especially compared to the old convertible PC-tablet hinge designs with a swiveling single hinge base.- Solid and thin&light; at the same time, just like what an ultrabook supposed to beSo this thing weighs 3.4 lbs and is very thin. Not sure if there is much else to say about this. Just know that it doesn't bend or squeak when you grab it from its corner and hold it in the air (can't say that about many)- An ultrabook with user replaceable parts? Dream come true!Yep, you can replace the memory, SSD or the battery, unlike Macbook Air or 13 Retina (regular MBP 13 is not fair comparison). Oh I almost forgot: Did you know that there is an empty SATA slot that you can use to put in a second SSD? Blew my mind when I learned about it.- Smooth and sensitive large touch-pad, nice keyboard; overall good ergonomicsTouch pad is nice. It is sensitive and has a smooth surface with built-in buttons (anywhere is clickable, but there are still buttons integrated on the bottom). It supports quite a few multi-touch gestures along with Win8 specials like slide-in gestures. It is missing a few gestures (more on that later) but one it support are nicely done. First time I can comfortably use two finger scrolling, pinching etc.Keyboard is good. It could be better, a little firmer keys could have been used but, again, this is a subjective observation and it is better than most. The only thing my wife doesn't like is the layout of some of the keys: placement of the home/end, small right-shift key etc. We'll see if we can get used to that.- Windows 8 is great (though not flawless yet)With all the fuss about Windows 8, let me tell you this: It won't bother you, really. If you like Windows 7, Windows 8 is even better in terms of under the hood performance (faster boot, smoother throughout) along with visible improvements (e.g. the new task manager, file copy system, better multi-monitor support) with only a mostly-aesthetic change that is the new Metro start screen, which you can ignore for most of the time if you *really* hate it (search for Start8 program if you would like to use Windows 8 like a better Windows 7 including the good old start menu). That said, you might even like the new Metro interface since it is *really* a joy to use with a good touch screen (which this one has). How good? We got into a fight over whose turn it is to play the Wordament game last night. Yup, it's good for your love life too!== Cons ==- Trackpad is missing some gestures thanks to LenovoThis is interesting since original Synaptic drivers would allow you to do so much more (three finger flicks, four finger touches, smoother scrolling) but that won't support the tablet mode as well (I tried and had issues when in tablet mode, not being able to use on-screen keyboard etc.) Not a deal breaker but it would be nice if Lenovo supported a little more (especially three finger flicks would be nice).- Windows 8 is not *fully* there yetFirst of all, let me say this is kind of expected and not really MS' fault. Windows is undergoing a huge (and brave) paradigm shift and these things are kind of normal in transitions like these. Also, this is purely subjective; you may not feel the same. Now: The new interface is clean and nice; Everything is smooth and well suitable for touch (mostly Metro parts). However, it just seems/feels like some things could have been done better. Can't put my finger on it though; it's just a feeling I get. Sometimes the integration feels incomplete. Especially when you are dealing with relatively advanced things like picking which updates from MS to download (this involves both Metro settings screen and the classic Control Panel for some reason). Again, nothing serious but something to mention.Also, there are a lot of Metro apps in the store but it is still in its infancy. It will get better but right now (as of Nov '12) it is lacking, and the apps they have on store are mostly beta-ish quality. Android Market in 2008 anyone? Lets say Windows 8 has a lot more incentive for developers since it is going to be on millions of devices very soon.== Meeh ==- It can be a tablet but it is not an actual tablet (iPad/Android) replacementDon't expect to throw away your tablet the minute you get this. It is a little heavy and large to be a tablet. However, it is wonderful for those times you need a screen on your table/counter but you can't bother to use touchpad/keyboard. My wife uses it to read and search for recipes; she can browse through easily just by touch (even in normal Windows apps, not just Metro) and I love this setup when I browse through reddit while eating (via ReddHub app or browser). Oh by the way: Internet Explorer 10 for Metro is great. Not much to complain there. I believe Yoga would best complimented with a 7\" tablet for other times.- Battery life is very good but may not be the bestI haven't actually measured it but it doesn't seem to last as long as, say, Macbook Air. It is still good enough for our purposes (which would be anything more than 5 hrs). Though, this is when we are doing a lot of surfing, watching couple of shows on Netflix, some coding etc. It is not bad in any way but if you are looking for something that will last you the whole 7 hr flight while enjoying movies all the way, you might want to look elsewhere.- It doesn't get hot, at all, but fan is on constantly, though not so noticeable or distractiveNot much else to say. It's just that the fan is on most of the time and it is noticeable if you are in a *very* quiet room but even than it is not really bothering us. I just wanted to point it out. On the other hand, it never got hot on us yet, so the cooling performance is good for normal usage (may not be so for gamers, not sure)== Wrap Up ==All in all this is a *very* good ultrabook, a capable laptop and a nice tablet alternative depending on what you use one for. It has a great screen with good colors, good resolution and nicely done touch capability. The keyboard is good the touchpad is better than most PCs (not on par with Macbook's, still) and it is overall very comfortable to use.I would suggest this laptop if you are in the market for a good and capable Windows 8 machine that doesn't need to play latest Crysis in good settings and won't damage your wallet. It seems like Lenovo really does know how to make nice laptops :)(P.S.

Not something you'll be holding in your hand as an ereader for long.Sensitive Touchscren - the touchscreen is a bit on the sensitive side I've doubled clicked and tabbed other windows open by accident.Odd portrait mode - because of the resolution if you're reading it in portrait mode it is a bit thin and long.Not 1080p - not a big deal to me but it might be to others.Exposed keyboard as tablet - The keys will be exposed when you use this as a tablet, while they are turned off it is somewhat odd griping this and feeling buttons.No microphone input - Sounds petty but I like the option of having a microphone input.Outside of the finicky touchscreen, the cons are rather minor to me, while I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is looking to use a tablet most or all of the time, I highly recommend this to anyone looking to pick up an ultrabook and is even slightly interested in having a tablet as well.", "Date": "October 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Surprisingly Good for Gaming", "Author": "Christopher D. Mcbride", "ReviewID": "R210C68E4KXHBB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "**NOTE: I purchased this in person at a large B&M; retailer, (rhymes with Rest Guy) as it was not for sale on Amazon at the time and have also posted my review on their site.**Most reviewers have touched on the great parts of the Yoga 13 but I will reiterate some of them:- Fantastic 1600x900 IPS display. While it is glossy, it works great at ANY angle which is a must for a multi-use device as this one is trying to be.- Hinge is of extremely good quality, as is the rest of the device. It just feels like a premium product.- Keyboard is nicely spaced and offers a very satisfying level of tactile feedback, but FYI, the backspace key, while large, is not full size.- Battery life has been about 7-8 hours for me doing light web browsing. You can get at least 5.5 if you are streaming a lot, and I watched two full length movies on Amazon on one charge.- External controls allow you to power on/off, control volume, and lock screen orientation without having to access the keyboard side of the device, which is very helpful in tablet mode. The power button is slightly recessed, but once you are familiar with where it is, this is not a problem.- The wireless antenna seems to maintain very good signal within my entire 2,000 square foot home, something my previous laptop, (a Sony Vaio TZ) did not do, and it maintains better speeds than my wife's Acer as well.- I have to again echo everyone else's comments on the great versatility of the Yoga. It is perfect for any situation and you will find yourself using it in ways you can only imagine around the house and at the office. It is absolutely great for propping up in bed on my stomach/chest with the keyboard as the base and just using the touchscreen. I used to have my iPad for bed surfing before I went to sleep, but the Yoga is so much better as you don't have to hold it, and the screen is bigger making it better for watching movies in bed.The ONE \"not so good\" thing I have to say about the Yoga is the trackpad is finnicky. It is a single slab with two clicky spots on the bottom representing left and right buttons on a mouse. Unfortunately, these locations on the trackpad are also used for touch, so if you are trying to click text or a box on the screen, you have to be VERY quick and precise otherwise it does not register as a click and will rather just move the cursor a slight bit. This can become infuriating after the third or fourth attempted click, and I find myself giving up and just using the touchscreen as it is far more accurate. Hopefully this will be fixed with a driver update in the future. I just don't know why almost all companies have decided to go away from dedicated mouse buttons. *Sigh*All of those things covered, I did not buy this intending to do ANY gaming on it. I want to include some details on how it is for gaming as I feel like there may be others out there that may be deciding between this and a less portable, but more powerful device.The Yoga is essentially an ultrabook and I have not read anywhere that anyone has attempted to do any gaming on it, but I have a Steam account and do some gaming on my custom built desktop gaming PC. On a whim, I downloaded Steam to the Yoga and a few games to see if they would run at all, and if so, how they would look/play. I am actually SHOCKED at how playable, and actually, how GOOD they look on the Yoga's 1600x900 display.Let's be clear here, though, this is not a gaming powerhouse. But I can play Amnesia: The Dark Descent in native resolution with all settings on at least medium, with some on high. I loaded up Dear Esther and it too plays at native 1600x900 resolution on medium/high settings maintaining around 35-50 fps. The SSD helps out I am sure, and even pushing it to the max, the Yoga doesn't get uncomfortably hot. The left side of the keyboard does get pretty warm if you are going to be using the built in keyboard for WASD controls. I have been plugging in my Xbox 360 controller and using that, but did play about 3 hours of Amnesia using the keyboard and a wireless mouse and it worked great.I am sure extremely new games will have to be played on lower settings, but rest assured, if you just want to do some light gaming on the go, the Yoga will satisfy your needs. I get about 3 hours of battery life when gaming, which is generally very good on any gaming laptop, let alone one that is not meant for gaming at all.A side note FYI - the only vent opening is on the back end of the device, basically by the hinge and the speakers are under the keyboard, (and actually sound very good and get very loud). I mention the vents because it is nice that the heat is not dissipated from underneath the device, but if you fold the display so that the keyboard is facing down as a base, the vent will be facing toward you and the speakers will not be as loud.Overall I could not be any happier. I would have given it 5 stars WITHOUT knowing it can do some decent gaming, but since it can it is everything I could ever ask for in a device.I also purchased the official Lenovo sleeve which basically protects the computer while carrying it around. It is not meant to protect it from drops, but does a good job of protecting it if you put it in a bag or carry it with another device/book/note pad. The price is a little steep, but I must say it is worth it. You can also buy other, more traditional ultrabook cases that should also work just fine.Bottom line here is that the Yoga is successfully a tablet AND a laptop. I used to surf on my iPad, and then if there was anything I needed to do special, like go to a flash based site, fill out forms, or input any long lines of text, I would have to put down the iPad and go get my laptop, power it on, navigate to the site I needed to be at, and start all over. Now, with the Yoga, I simply fold the keyboard back out and put it in laptop mode. It truly is the best of both worlds. Highly, highly recommended!", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this machine but it will be better in time", "Author": "Kelly Kindopp \"GolfNutz\"", "ReviewID": "R19CLYMYLUBKLJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me first say I am a computer consultant and I have all the toys, Asus Zenbook (bye bye Zenbook), Ipad, Iphone, and Nexus 7.  When the new windows 8 came out I wanted a convertible so I could have the best of both worlds, a tablet in bed that didn't limit me to playing games and surfing the web.  Enter the Yoga.I LOVE THIS MACHINE.I am absolutely blown away by the boot and shut down times, about 6 secs and 1 sec, yes about 1 sec for it to shut off. Switching users, waking from sleep, all those tasks are so fast it is incredible.  I have the zenbook with an SSD running Win 7 and it is pretty fast too, but nothing like windows 8. WOWI have to say I couldn't give this machine to 99% of my customers without doing some updating, tweaking and a hands on windows 8 lesson.  It isn't for the faint of heart.  I think they call us early adopters which is just a nice way of saying people who have to have the lastest gadgets and toys even though they know they should wait until the bugs get worked out.Most who read this will know of the issues people are having, if not just visit the Lenovo Yoga forums.I have had no Wifi problems, My track pad really sucked but it is good now, not sure how this one got fixed.  I had a little screen flicker but it turned out to be a setting in the Intel Graphics software. I had the on screen key board problem that it popped up for 1 sec but before I could type it was gone, the first windows update I did fixed this. The screen rotating is buggy, sometiimes it works fine and other times not so much.  Hard to say for sure if this is a Lenovo or Windows thing but I am sure it will improve.Windows 8 has its own strengths and weaknesses, it takes time to figure things out but being a computer guy I like exploring, the Ipad was fun for about a week then after that it is just boring.I won't rant too much about apple here except to say I will never buy another product from them again.  I had to have the Ipad when it first came out and I loved it...  2 years later they have pushed out updates that have made my Ipad 1 almost useless, it crashes all the time and is terribly slow.  I thought no big deal I will just restore it to the day I bought it for 850.00.  NOT, you cant restore it back, apple updates you and erases your previous software.  So I thought I would just go get it from the net.  NOT... each operating system is specific to each machine, so they intentionally pushed out software that they knew would cripple my ipad and also knew there was no way for me to fix it.  Nice business model.  Same applies for the Iphone 3 and 3GS, all useless if you upgrade to IOS5.But I digress, the YOGA has made my Ipad expendable.Now I wouldn't recommend the YOGA as your only machine, I use my laptop for Travel, a little on site trouble shooting and mostly to read, watch tv, surf, etc in bed at night and this machine is exceptional for that.  If you cant find a comfortable position with this machine in bed you will never find a comfortable position.  I LOVE IT.I wish I had the will power to hold off and get the Orange one but I couldn't wait.So in closing, it is a little buggy, the build is wonderful, the form factor is the most useful I have ever seen and there is NO WAY I would give up this machine.One last thing, I bought the Lenovo sleeve for the Yoga thinking it would be a nice case and it is designed so you can slip it over the keypad when you are in tablet mode.  First, the keys don't bother me at all, in bed it is a non issue.  The sleeve doesn't contain the whole machine, about 1 - 1.5 inches stick out from the end.  It is very thin offering almost no protection to my baby.  It went back immediately and I bought a very nice protective sleeve from Puma for the same price.Hope this helps some people out there, I know I appreciate all the other users taking the time to write reviews.

My mistake. I should have made sure I tried the keyboard before ordering one myself. But in my defense, I never imagined that Lenovo could make a bad keyboard. After all, the keyboard on my $600 Lenovo V570 was the best thing about that particular laptop.Imagine my surprise when I received my Yoga and discovered that it lacks a typically excellent Lenovo keyboard. In fact, the keyboard on this machine (I'm typing this review on it) is infuriating for anyone who's ever used a decent keyboard in their life (like the keyboard of a Lenovo ThinkPad or MacBook). It's simply soft and mushy with lots of springiness. And some of the keys--among them the minus, plus, and top-right row of function keys--actually creak (i.e., make a creaking sound) when pressed! As a writer and programmer who intended to use the Yoga heavily in grad school as well as at work, I need a good keyboard which isn't an exercise in frustration every time I use it. For heavy typing, I think most typists will find the Yoga's keyboard quite frustrating.On top of the keyboard issues you can expect to experience trackpad frustration as the Synaptics drivers apparently crash intermittently making using the trackpad an adventure. Ugh. I'm sure they'll release better drivers for it soon, but in the meantime it's very frustrating.But yes, on the bright side, the Yoga does feature an exceptional IPS screen. I love the resolution, clarity, color vibrancy, contrast, and viewing angles. It's a thing of beauty. And I really like how the Yoga looks. I just dislike the keyboard.[EDIT ON 11/14/12]In the process of self-upgrading the RAM in my Yoga from 4GB to 8GB I somehow managed to fix the \"creaking\" sound I heard before when pressing the minus and plus and F9-F12 keys. They're still not as quiet as the rest of the keys, but at least they don't produce a pronounced and odd sound for a keyboard to make. Now they just produce an louder sound when struck than the rest of the keys. It's possible that further experimentation with the metal tab behind that section of the keyboard will further improve the sound issue. We'll see. At least it doesn't sound anymore like those keys need a strong shot of WD40.[UPDATE ON 12/1/12]I really really really tried to get over myself and get used to the keyboard but the longer I used it the more work it was. It was just a difficult keyboard to use. You know how it is when you use a keyboard without consistent key action? Well, I found out, and it wasn't fun. When your fingers can't rely on every key responding the same way it means that your hands and brain have a difficult time learning how to use the keyboard efficiently. You're constantly hitting a key too hard or not hard enough--or letting your finger rest too long on it so you get repeated characters. And yes it's possible that I might have had a bad keyboard. But the difficult bouncy keyboard on top of the sub-par trackpad experience was just too much for me to take. I guess as I get older I have less patience with a product not being satisfactory right out of the gate. I have less patience with dinking around with support trying a new keyboard, or waiting for new drivers to come out for the trackpad. I just want things to work. So I sent the Yoga back to BestBuy and reverted to using my Lenovo V570 (with it's solid keyboard and good trackpad) while I wait for a new HP dv6t Envy to arrive next week. My hopes for the HP are that the keyboard is solid with consistent response, the trackpad is at least good, and the screen is good (I ordered the 1080p matte screen). I wish everyone else the best with their Yogas. If the keyboard is good on yours, awesome. If not, I feel for you. Like I said before: great screen, awesome form factor (the modes really are very useful), mediocre (at best) keyboard and trackpad. However, as a supplemental device I might consider purchasing one of these as long as I didn't plan on using the keyboard heavily. I.e., I suspect that the Yoga is a better device all-around than the Microsoft Surface (though I haven't used a Surface). It has a real keyboard, the screen is amazing, and the fact that it has a sturdy 360 degree hinge allows you to place it in all kinds of useful positions you'd never be able to put a tablet or laptop.", "Date": "November 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best of everything...", "Author": "Paulgeek", "ReviewID": "R2NB83DCXV6LW6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First let me say a couple of things about me.

Daniel \"Professional Geek\"", "ReviewID": "R1XSX98ZGEBYPN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great laptop/tablet combo. Now, because of the size and weight of the laptop when it's in \"tablet mode\", you'll mostly be using it as a laptop, and sometimes finding it convenient to use it as a tablet (I do so for \"Angry Birds\" and other gaming sessions).The screen is nice and bright, and the viewing angles are superb (granted, I'm coming from a Zenbook Prime, where if you tilted your head too far, the colors went weird and you didn't have a good viewing experience). The touchscreen is usually very responsive, but I did find that sometimes it wouldn't pick up a swipe. I did learn that's because Windows defaults to turning off the driver after so much time of no-use and that you can turn it off from doing so (with a slight, and mean very slight, hit to battery).Coming from a Zenbook Prime, this keyboard is a definite step up. The keys have nice play, but aren't mushy. They also have a nice click and feedback to them, but aren't difficult to press down. They're spaced just right for my hands and fingers to do long sessions of typing without needing a lot of breaks. I only wish they'd put more work in the touchpad. Physically, the touchpad is GREAT. It's big enough to allow you to go from one side of the screen to the next without having to lift your fingers. It clicks well, and is, well, a touchpad. The problem is in the drivers. I find myself frequently needing to restart the drivers. It's not a problem, as the touchpad still works, but you lose some of the mutli-touch support and Windows 8 gestures. It's not a huge problem, but definitely an annoyance.I bought this laptop/tablet because I do development work and wanted something with a touchscreen that I could use to develop on the go. This definitely as the power already to run through all of my work, including debugging in Visual Studio 2012, web browsing, and having a few Word Docs open at the same time. I did update the RAM myself (a fairly quick and EXTREMELY simple thing to do with this laptop) and that may be worth the extra $40 to do so. I highly recommend it as everything seemed to pick up speed and responsiveness from there.The only problem I had with this was the wonky partitioning scheme that Lenovo used. One can go into the disk management and backup/remove any partitions they don't want, but I'm also not the average consumer. For example: I can't imagine my mother knowing that that's even an option. I also wouldn't want to try and walk her through doing it. I think this partitioning scheme was a mistake, but at this point, has no effect one me.So, in conclusion, if you want a solid laptop that also makes a pretty good tablet, this is your machine. I really enjoy using it. Just know going in that you may have to restart touch pad drivers (unless Lenovo has updated them) and/or you may have to work with the partitions.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Had to ship the yoga back", "Author": "Thomas Westbury \"mozart\"", "ReviewID": "R36DLCZL039SG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The yoga came in working fine in all respects. It is a great laptop with cutting edge technology. Very fast with the ssd, beautiful display, highly responsive to touch which makes win 8 an overall enjoyable experience. I dl'ed Start8 so essentially I have both win 7 & win 8. I have no problems with the keyboard. I've owned the Lenovo z565 for about 2 years and its been an excellent and reliable laptop for business and pleasure. I can't tell the difference between the 2 kb's. I got the yoga for my SO and she loves it.So what is the problem? It works fine in laptop mode with the display vertical. If I push the display to the rear, the screen goes blank. I tried the tent mode and tablet mode when it came in and both worked fine. Now, there is no screen on the latter 2. I start to bend the display into tent or tablet and after about an inch no screen. I called Lenovo, got through quickly to someone who actually spoke english, and was told it sounded like a hardware problem and to ship it back. They sent me an rma to take to fedex so no charge to return it. I always keep original packing which, in this case, was excellent for shipping. (another Lenovo plus) I got an email 2 days later saying they had received it. I'm expecting a fairly quick return if it is a hardware issue. It appears that the wiring inside the hinges from the main board to the display is faulty.At this point I still give it 4 stars. You can't expect 100% quality control. Occasionally, something like this will happen no matter how hard they try to prevent it. And I searched the reviews and no one else mentions this issue so I assume it is a quirk in an otherwise fine laptop. I am so far highly pleased with Lenovo service for the quick and efficient way they are handling this.Update 7-5-13 The Yoga was shipped back by fedex in less than a week.

I travel quite a bit with my job and have really enjoyed the light weight and great battery life.  I attended a conference last week and it was nice to not have to worry about finding an outlet during an entire day.  My other notebook is a Dell Latitude and I'm lucky to get an hour and a half of battery life out of it.I've also had a chance to do a couple of client presentations with the Yoga and received lots of compliments about it.  The only problem I experienced was forgetting my HDMI to VGA adapter for the first presentation - won't do that again.From a performance standpoint, I couldn't be happier.  I really like the instant on/off.  Restarts are amazingly quick - of course, I'm comparing it to my Dell box running Win XP.  As other reviewers have noted, the small hard drive is a bit disappointing, but I doubt I will be personally exceed the available space as I will be primarily using it for business travel.Regarding Win8, I quickly figured out the dual interfaces and although I agree it might confuse some people, I haven't had any trouble adjusting.  My six year old son loves playing games and drawing on the touch screen.  I've had to pry the Yoga out of his hands multiple times, only to find the screen smeared with the residue of whatever snack he was eating.  The good news is that the screen is pretty easy to clean.In summary, I am enjoying my Yoga and am very happy with the purchase.", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Overall, awesome device.", "Author": "Hannah Danielle", "ReviewID": "R352940E7KDYVI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm not sure why Amazon lists it for more, but I got it for $1000 from Best Buy. It is the same model, I compared the specs. There are more expensive versions available from Lenovo.I write this review from the perspective of a high school student. I use the Yoga for schoolwork (papers, research, online activities), streaming videos, surfing the web, and playing light games (i.e. Cut the Rope).Good things:-Bright screen, with good resolution.-Easy to navigate.-Feels natural to reach out and touch the screen.-Keyboard is nice to type on. The keys are well spaced, and go down a pretty good amount. The top buttons are actually useful. Side buttons for top and bottom of page. The onscreen keyboard is also nice. I get about 50wpm on the actual keyboard and 30wpm on the onscreen one.-Touchpad works. No problems.-Flipping it around is easy, feels natural.-Feels sturdy, nice exterior.-People think it's super cool. That's always a plus.-Loads things quickly. Doesn't freeze. Turns on in about three seconds.-The four modes all have their uses.  -Stand mode: good for having it as a tablet that stands up by itself while on your lap. Can also be on tables, floor, etc.  -Laptop mode: good for being a laptop.  -Tablet mode: even though some people have said they don't like having the keys on the back, it doesn't bother me.  -Tent mode: good when you want it to rest on an uneven surface, or a table. I prefer tent mode to stand mode unless it's on my lap. This is because in stand mode, the screen sometimes goes back a little when you touch it.-Windows button to return to the home screen below screen.-Power button is on the outside, the part that faces you when it's in laptop mode. This is good and bad. The good is that when it's in tablet mode, it's easy to turn off and on, because it's on the top.-Hinges feel sturdy.Bad things:-The camera is not the best. A lot of other hybrids/tablets have much better ones.-Sometimes I accidently do one of the motions on the touchpad, and it switches my screen.-Not a lot of apps. For example, there is currently a top 100 free games section, and there's only 98 apps in it. Hopefully this will get better with time though. Also, the apps are often more expensive than they are on the Apple App store. Fruit Ninja is $5, but it's only $1 on the apple store.-No keypad on the side. Clearly this could not fit, but my family laptop does have one, so I sometimes find myself reaching for it.-Power button on the outside: I have turned it off by accident a couple of times.-I worry the keyboard might get hurt. But it is slightly inset, so if I have it in tablet mode I can set it down without the keys getting hit.-It's too heavy to hold with one hand in tablet mode for more than a minute or two.Bottom line: (in case you skipped all that)I am happy with my purchase. The Lenovo Yoga is fast, responsive, and has a good keyboard. Definitely a good choice for someone in the market for a hybrid. It is not that annoying to have the keys on the back. A great laptop, a great tablet. :)Edit: I've changed my review to four stars, because while I do love my Yoga, I've run into additional problems with continued usage. These may seem small, but they do add up. Sometimes the flip thing doesn't register, so the keys and touchpad don't turn on. Sometimes clicking randomly doesn't work. I have to 'reset the wi-fi adapter' like once a week, and I know it's my laptop because other people are still able to use wi-fi.

I have to say, this is a genius design for a laptop-tablet hybrid. The strength of the yoga lies in that it isn't really a hybrid. A hybrid entails a device that is part one design and part the other. The microsoft surface/surface pro is a good example of this. The lenovo yoga isn't a hybrid of a tablet and a laptop, it is an extension of the laptop into the world of tablets. I say this because there are absolutely no design drawbacks that come from the addition of its tablet features. Fundamentally, the yoga is a superb ultrabook whether or not you factor in its tablet features or not.Features that make it a good ultrabook-good keyboard. Not as nice as a lenovo's thinkpad but then again I don't see how you possibly could fit one of those keyboards in this thing. Also, it would be nice if it was an illuminated keyboard.-thin and light. This is a pretty small laptop! Maybe not as small as the thinnest ones out there like the acer s7 but its fine for me.-full size track pad. Some people have complained about issues with the trackpad. I haven't had any. It is a big and accurate trackpad.-screen. The resolution could be higher, but the yoga's IPS screen is bright and very nice to look at. It really stands out compared to most laptop screens-hinges. They are stiff and tough!-ports. The power port is built to take a whack and not break. All the other ports are nice as well. My yoga went flying in the car and fell on the headphone jack pretty hard. The headphone cord bent but the jack is fine!-speakers. These are pretty good speakers. Not the best, but they have good range and volume. Definitely not afterthought speakers you find on so many windows laptops.Consider that all these features go into a competitively priced ultrabook that can fold into a tablet!Now as a tablet the yoga has some issues. First, it is heavy for a tablet (not for a laptop). You are probably going to have to be sitting down to use it like a traditional tablet. However, when I am on the move I am going to use my cell phone anyways. Some might consider the screen dimensions awkward for a tablet, but when held in portrait mode (the long side of the screen vertical) this thing makes a KILLER pdf reader. Seriously, I am a science major and I usually hate reading scientific papers on a computer but I really don't mind it on the yoga.Overall I think this is an amazing laptop-tablet hybrid. I can't see myself buying a normal clamshell laptop again. Why would I? The yoga has all the features of an ultrabook and more. I do have two gripes. The keyboard should be illuminated and the webcam could be better. Those only detract slightly from the overall package however. I strongly, STRONGLY recommend this laptop!", "Date": "March 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Windows 8 with a quality touchscreen = a winner", "Author": "Bill Wood \"Bill\"", "ReviewID": "R2UJ6WKRZ8WL6F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been looking for a new laptop to replace my 6 year old IBM/Lenovo T60p which has a very nice wide viewing angle \"IPS\" display with good color. Most laptops have horrible displays which change colors as you push the screen forward and back.The Yoga is a \"convertible\" and can switch between a standard laptop, two \"stand\" modes, and tablet mode. It has a gorgeous, bright, IPS display. My main dislike is the aspect ratio, which is 16:9 instead of 16:10. Only Mac laptops have a 16:10 aspect ratio, which is unfortunate because they aren't available with touch screens and have issues running Windows in Bootcamp.For tablet use, the Yoga is large. It can be used on your lap as a tablet, but it's unwieldy to hold it up for long. The 16:9 aspect ratio means that it's awfully long and thin in portrait mode. It works best in the \"stand\" modes (especially for movie viewing) and laptop mode.The Yoga's boot time is ridiculous. It's the fastest device I own, booting in 10 seconds or less. From standby, wait time is 1-2 seconds.On the Yoga I spend more time using the traditional desktop mode than the metro interface, but that may change with time as more apps become available. Netflix in the metro interface is great. Desktop mode is quite usable with the touchscreen and trackpad; I often reach to the screen to move a window or scroll a web page. Touch is definitely a winner with Windows 8.With respect to my T60p, the Yoga is about twice as fast and has much more memory capacity. The T60p has a gorgeous 15\", 4:3 IPS display but it's a bit dim in it's old age. Overall the Yoga is more responsive, much lighter, thinner, brighter, faster, better battery life (5-6 hours) - an improvement in most ways except screen size and aspect ratio.Unlike iPad and Android tablets, the Yoga isn't really designed to be \"always on / always connected\", at least I haven't tried that and I have it set to go into standby when the lid is closed. The Yoga and other PC convertibles are laptops first. I can't speak to the Windows 8 tablets that have keyboard docks, such as the interesting-looking Samsung Ativ series, as I haven't tried them.The 128gb SSD storage isn't large enough for me, however there is an open mSATA slot where you can add another SSD.  You can add more memory up to 8GB.  Also Lenovo has recently released a \"patch\" that increases the amount of free space on the SSD significantly. You don't even have to reboot :-)Although Windows 8 has received a lot of bad press, I believe that it will revitalize the PC industry to some extent, and provide many options for people like me that are looking for a device that is more powerful than a tablet while still being portable and touch-friendly.  Soon many laptops will have touch screens, and the quality of the screens will improve because convertibles like the Yoga that function in tablet mode can't afford to shift colors when you move them around.Check out the Yoga, and it's little brother the Lenovo Twist, both of which are great laptops first, and tablets second. The \"stand\" modes are great too. Dell makes a 12.5 inch convertible with a rotating screen. There are also many laptops coming available that don't convert to a tablet mode but have gorgeous IPS touch screen displays, such as the 15.6\" HP Spectre XT Touchscreen. I've ordered one of these as the Yoga's screen at 13.3\" isn't quite large enough for me, so I may return the Yoga.Products like the Microsoft Surface are interesting, but it's too much a tablet and not enough a laptop for me.  I have a Nexus 7 tablet and just don't use it that much.  For me, a Windows laptop with tablety features like the Yoga makes the most sense, complemented by a smartphone.", "Date": "December 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Really like this, after I got through the Win8 learning curve", "Author": "J. P. Conley", "ReviewID": "R257WAS7WHNLCT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and children got me this for my birthday, a couple of weeks ago.  I say this because I'm too cheap to buy something this expensive for myself. <grin>  I was definitely non-plussed by it, and it took some adjusting on my part.  Oh, I have been using computers since the mid-70s (gives you an idea of what birthday it was), and have all sorts of experience on HW, SW, & OSs so I'm definitely not a novice user.  That said, here's a random list of my impressions after 2 1/2 weeks:- Win8 definitely took some getting used to - I would say it's not very intuitive to use.  It's also somewhat clunky with a mouse and keyboard, so I can see where using it on a non-touchscreen device could be frustrating.  However, it's a good effort at a fairly new idea.  One minor peeve:  you can re-arrange the Start screen, but there are some limiting aspects.  It forces me to group tiles in specific grids - that's very minor.  More frustrating is trying to arrange the tiles in a grid.  The way it shifts the existing tiles is not readily predictable - I sometimes have to move tiles around several times to get the grid arranged as I want.  I hope an update will push soon to change that.- Windows App Store.  Limited, for now.  I know that'll change.  Apple and Android went through those periods, too.- Some of the changes in names are puzzling. Charms?  Kind of a silly name, but once I knew what those could do I forgot the name; all I care about is what it can do.  But that does bring up another peeve of mine.  I can accept change, when it IMPROVES on something.  When it's just change for change sake I get frustrated.- I absolutely love the laptop / tablet mechanics.  It feels VERY sturdy; I don't think I'll need to worry about those hinges failing in any way.  I do know from reading a lot of reviews that some people are bothered by having the keyboard exposed on the back when it's in tablet mode.  I was too, but I bought a sleeve for it.  The sleeve fits it nicely when closed, and when I use this as a tablet I slip it over the keyboard - end of problem, IMHO.  After all, I'd want a sleeve for a tablet in any case.- I have read complaints over its bulk and weight as a tablet.  Well, it's NOT a tablet, it's a convertible.  I've never bothered with a tablet - too much money for too little capability - so I don't even consider this comparison.  I don't find it too heavy or bulky, given the way I use it.- Battery life is awesome.  This lasts far longer than any laptop I've ever used.- The screen is gorgeous!!  Bright, sharp, high contrast, incredibly wide viewing angle - it's got it all.  I don't see (pun intended) any flaws or negatives.- Disk space.  Yes, it's limited, but so much is shifting to cloud storage so it's not as big of an issue as it would've been a few years ago.  And hey, with a USB 3.0 port, and the size (physical and g-bytes) of external drives I can always get more.- The Novo Recovery system.  I like that it's got a separate button to start that - no need to bang away on a Function key, change the Boot order, and Restart.  Just one press and you're in the Utility.

To make this review I have used this laptop as my main machine for work, mind you I do not do anything crazy like game or video editing. Windows 8 on a touchscreen laptop is amazing, it is fast and easy to navigate. The touchscreen is quite responsive there are minor hiccups like any touchscreen device so nothing major. The IPS screen on this yoga is amazing, the color is great and it is view able on so many angle. So when the Yoga is in stand mode or tent mode and you are watching a movie, or video clip and it is in high def the picture is great, sadly the screen is not 1080p but the picture is still amazing. I can run Adobe Dreamweaver CS 6 perfectly. MS Office Home and Student 2010 and the 2013 preview run with no hiccups.The Lenovo Yoga boots up quickly even with all the software installed I get a to the login menu in 5 seconds. Love the original idea of the 4 positions of the Yoga, from laptop mode, tent mode, stand mode and tablet mode. If you are worried about the keys when in tablet mode the keyboard is disabled and when in stand mode the borders around the keyboard is raised and with a rubber texture, so the keys do not hit the table and the laptop does not move. If in tablet mode and worried about the keys you can buy the Lenovo yoga case and use it as a keyboard slip cover.It is lightweight at 3.3 lbs, I can carry it all day without any strain. When home you can plug it into a High Def TV with the HDMI cable. You also have 1 USB 3.0 port and 1 2.0 USB Port, also a SD  card Reader, and lone headphone port. You do not get a way to connect this with a wired connection as there is no Ethernet jack,A couple of cons to the laptop that I have come through. The Lenovo Yoga's keyboard at first feels cramped but you get use to it over the time. The other the fact that it does not have a dual band wireless card built in. The trackpad also went on three fits of not working, but went back to work immediately, but synaptic should release an update for that. The battery life could also be improved I get a little over 5.5 hours with it. The way Lenovo also partitioned this drive is pretty weird, takes a lot of space away from the computer, would probably upgrade to a bigger SSD.

I also don't really use it as a tablet, since I have an iPad, and after having compared the two, I'd rather go with the iPad being a tablet and the Yoga being a laptop. The touchscreen is, of course, very handy and cool, but this particular piece of technology is a little too bulky for being a tablet.Here are some inconveniences I've had so far:1) After re-opening the laptop from the sleep mode, multitouch functions stop working. This is probably a Windows 8 issue. Not entirely catastrophic, but ever so mildly annoying.2) No Ethernet. A big mistake altogether, not much need to explain why.3) A built-in mic is always nice, but can I please have a mic jack? There's plenty of room on the laptop's sides; oversimplifying it is also a bit of a mistake.4) My own little whim: I'd love a backlit keyboard.And now for the pros:1) Weight: maybe it's not a MacBook Air, but it's plenty damn light, at least for me.2) Speed: the SSD drive, combined with an i5 processor and 4GB of RAM makes this laptop lightning fast. Once again, I haven't had a single glitch; starting apps and accessing files takes mere seconds.3) Display: it's not FullHD, but it delivers great colours - much better than many other laptops.4) Design: simple, stylish, well-built, with nothing cheap about it. Well, the laptop itself isn't cheap, either.5) Battery life. I put this under the pros, but this is an entirely individual thing. I haven't run into any problems with it, but I'm not much of a traveler, and every time I use this laptop, I'm usually next to a power outlet.Bottom line is, if you are a PC user with a $1000+ to spend on a laptop, get this one.

At this point it offers the best combination of tablet features (put it on your lap and use touch screen to browse and read, with short comments or reply's to emails & blogs) and real computers (able to do complex tasks like financial spreadsheets, home design, and project scheduling/CAD.  Does it compromise to be able to cover everything - yes.  But yes in the sense that every computer is a compromise.  Does it do as well as a standalone tablet: no.

I bet Apple is working hard right now on coming up with a response and that they'll eventually add touch to their laptops. Why pay premium $$$ for a laptop that doesn't have touch at this point?

I've come to the realization that this is a first generation product with all of the first generation woes that come with a first generation product. The trackpad continues to suck. I never use the Windows 8 tile mode - never. I've tried it multiple times in the early days and it's just a black hole for time. Wait 2 more years until there are some decent, refined apps for it. Newest problems is that last night the screen froze in the wrong horizontal mode so I had to watch a movie on my Yoga lengthwise (holding it long-ways up). Nothing I did fixed it. When the movie was over, it returned to the right screen orientation. ARGH. And the hard drive is way too small. I have **only** programs installed on my hard drive and have a mere 39 GB left on the C drive. In fact, I had to uninstall Adobe Acrobat (uses 2 GB) and install Foxit PDF (500 MB to save an extra 1.5 GB of space). That's crazy. I installed an extra SSD with 256 GB that's where I put my everyday files, powerpoint, videos, music, etc. I suspect I'll be running out of space for programs on the C drive before the useful life of this laptop is over. Lastly, the speakers have started making crackling noises. It's not music or videos I'm playing or a bad wifi connection on Skype. It happens all the time on everything. This is only 3 months old! Come on. Verdict: this is a first generation product. It's not a bad laptop but there is enough that goes wrong that it just frustrates me on a regular basis. It's still quite fast and the screen continues to be gorgeous. That's not enough for me to recommend it. I do recommend you wait until the second generation and see if it's any better.UPDATE FEB 22, 2013I'm changing the trackpad rating to 2.5 out of 10, down from 4 out of 10. It is really a bad trackpad. The problem seems to be mostly in the software, but it's hard to say. I have fiddled with every possible software setting to try and get it to behave, but it is really futile. The latest is that an erroneous movement on the trackpad will causes the mouse to freeze so I have to see if I can switch to the Win 8 tile mode, and then back to free the mouse cursor. If not, then I have to reboot. It's a fast reboot, but that's not the point. This shouldn't be happening. This is made by a major PC manufacturer and the year is 2013. COME ON - GET IT RIGHT!!UPDATE FEB 17, 2013The trackpad absolutely sucks. Has a mind of its own. I give it a 4 out of 10. And yes, I have adjusted and fiddled with every possible settings in the software. FAIL.The fan runs from time to time. It's not that loud.The touchscreen needs work. I was in a meeting with someone using an ipad and she flew from screen to screen on her ipad. I was trying to flick through screens on my Yoga and it just didn't work. Kept trying to highlight paragraphs on the screen.  FAIL.I agree with many of the other reviewers - Yoga falls short and wait until they can improve these things. The trackpad issue alone is enough to hold off buying. I can't believe the trackpad is so bad. I mean. Really?-----------------We're all busy people so I'll cut to the chase and save you some time. I bought the orange yoga intel i-5, 8 GB RAM, 128 GB SSD. I also purchased an extra 256 GB SSD from Crucial and installed myself (nerve-wracking but I did it). I've been using this daily for about 2 weeks now and here is my impression so farWHAT I LOVEbuild quality - clearly it was well designed and well constructedcolor - the orange is gorgeousscreen - high quality, brightweight & slimness - finally, a laptop I can travel with; AC adapter is also slim and lightweightsexy - yes, it is a sexy laptopspeed - reboots in about 2-3 seconds; programs open in 1-2 secondslocation of headphone jack - out of the way for legs, lap, etc.battery life/power mgmt - you have to fiddle to get it right for you but i was actually able to fly to europe and still have charge left in my laptop when i landed. obviously i didn't use the laptop for the entire 10 hour flight, but on a plane, between sleeping, eating, a movie and laptop work, i had plenty of juice.touchscreen - helps when the touchpad is acting up (but it's not a perfect touchscreen either - sometimes you want to click on something and have to end up using the touchpad anyway)WHAT I HATEtouchpad - really?! such a gorgeous machine and the trackpad is incredibly temperamental. i played with every possible setting in the software, trust me. i actually went looking for an old USB plugin mouse but i've given them all away to charity and i refuse to buy another external mouseWindows 8 - the problem actually isn't Windows (can you believe it?), it's the apps that have been redesigned for Windows 8. Think first generation software. Take Evernote. You actually can't sync or quit Evernote using the Windows 8 app. I ended up removing all Windows 8 apps and using the machine as a Windows 7 device. The idea of the touchscreen is nice and I think the apps will get there. But right now, Windows 8 is not needed.lenovo's customer \"service\" - one of the biggest nightmares I've experienced in recent memory. I had to end up calling credit card company to cancel a double charge and get credit for a price change on an accessory (lenovo said they would credit the difference but never did). you wait on hold w/ lenovo for ages, actually speak to someone and they never do what they say they will128 GB SSD gives you a useable amount of space of about 80-90 GB, after junk consolidation. that's criminal and renders a 128 GB SSD inadequate (your software and settings will end up taking 100 GB after 2-3 years of use).SURPRISESi actually don't use the different yoga poses as much as i thought i would. I attribute that to a temperamental touchpad more than anything elsei bought the protective sleeve but find it more annoying and don't really use it; also you can't put anything else in the sleeve because it's so tightadding the 2nd SSD was easier than I thought, but still no piece of cake. there are a few videos online showing how to do this - the one on youtube is not complete enough. You need some of those plastic tools to lift the keyboard up without scratching it and a torex screwdriver - google for the right sizes and exact tool names. takes a while to get the keyboard connector back in its socket. there was no way to get the keyboard clips to click back in place so the keyboard is now a bit bouncier than when I first got it - not bad though, but noticeable.", "Date": "February 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Aims high, Falls short", "Author": "James Rudning", "ReviewID": "R1IN9FLYA662YF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "DESIGNThe Yoga is an exciting device.  I had been following its progress since its first debut at CES 2012.  The 360-degree hinge is very innovative, successfully adding slate (let's not say tablet) functionality to a fully-usable Ultrabook.The finish on the Yoga is pretty to touch and to look at, but it does seem more susceptible to scratches and staining than the average laptop.DISPLAYOverall, the display on the Yoga is very nice.  It is IPS, has great viewing angles and nice colors.  Compared to most laptops, 1600 x 900 is \"high resolution\".  Unfortunately, after using smartphones with as many or more pixels on a 4 or 5 inch screen, my initial reaction when using the Yoga screen was \"pixels\".  I particularly noticed the pixilation when reading scaled text.  But this is no great fault of the Yoga itself, just the nature of our becoming accustomed to higher-resolution screens.In typical Lenovo fashion, the 360-degree hinge is very strong.  When you move the screen to a certain position, it will stay there, and that's something not every laptop can claim.  It opens and closes easily, and fully opens into \"Tablet Mode\" with a satisfying snap.  But on this point, the Yoga is not much use as a tablet, first of all being extremely awkward with keys exposed on the back (forget carrying an extra sleeve along), even though the keys and touchpad are disabled in this mode.  And furthermore it is much too heavy for true tablet use.  But as a slate with a stand (Lenovo: \"Stand Mode\"), the Yoga fills a very nice niche.KEYBOARDThe keyboard on the Yoga is mediocre.  Coming from a Lenovo ThinkPad, it was one of my biggest disappointments, since key action is somewhat mushy and the keyboard itself has flex in the middle.  It also lacks backlighting, which is a strange omission for a higher-end laptop.  In its favor, the keyboard does include dedicated Home and End keys, as well as function keys that do not require the user to depress the \"Fn\" key to use them.TOUCHPADThe touchpad on the Yoga is one of the best on a Windows machine.  It has a nice texture which allows your finger to glide smoothly across, and pointing is accurate.  In addition, two-finger scrolling is very smooth, unlike some of the competition.WIRELESSIn my use of the Yoga, I did not have problems with the wireless.  However, the wireless card does not support 802.11a (5 GHz) WiFi, which means it will not be able to take advantage of a dual-band router's ability to avoid congestion on 2.4 GHz frequencies.  This, again, is an unfortunate omission for a laptop in this price range, and should give pause to any buyer who wants full compatibility with all home router technologies.There have been a number of user complaints with regard to limited range on the Yoga WiFi, though I did not have a chance to validate these claims.NOISEHere is the deal-breaker for me.  The fan on this laptop runs constantly, and in a quiet environment, is very audible.  My unit's fan was not defective, as it did not make any grinding or scraping noises like some have reported, but the constant `woosh' of fan noise at a volume and frequency higher than other models was too much to be ignored in a quiet environment.  Some work all day in a noisy office or house and will not notice this, others, like me, spend lots of time in a quiet work environment or bedroom, and the noise is overpowering.  Hopefully Lenovo will rectify this issue through a software update at some point, but for now, it is definitely an issue to be aware of.UPGRADABILITYThe Yoga scores a big plus in the upgradability category, since users can not only upgrade their SSD, but also add a second SSD, as well as upgrade their RAM.  There are several how-to articles available on the web to accomplish this.WRAP-UPMy overall assessment of the Ideapad Yoga is that it is a great concept not quite ready for prime-time.  The pretty screen and acrobatic form-factor are overshadowed by a mediocre keyboard and a noisy fan, not to mention the glaring omission of 5 GHz wireless capability for dual-band routers, and the question of how long the finish will endure before it looks as dingy as the store model.I ended up exchanging my Yoga for an Asus Zenbook Prime Touch (UX31A-BHI5T11).  The Zenbook has some quality-control issues with its screen and inferior trackpad, but otherwise has a better (and backlit) keyboard, better wireless, quieter fan, and sharper screen, all coming in a thinner and lighter profile.  Though I would currently recommend the Asus over the Yoga, I think all of the PC manufacturers need to take a closer look at their consumer feedback and quality control before rushing the next device to market.", "Date": "January 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Finally!", "Author": "AmazonShopper", "ReviewID": "R3CW5C4OVTPZJH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been waiting for the perfect \"convertible\" product for a very long time!

The 128GB SSD formats down to only about 70GB of actual storage so be aware of that, but seeing as how most things are cloud based or, in my case, stored on our home server, this won't be a problem!

There's a lot of getting up and moving around, but when we sit back down to our laptops, mine is the first to be up and running so I can start frantically taking notes like a crazy person (take note: grad school is hard, kids).Doesn't get sluggish:I need to run multiple powerpoints, word docs, pdfs, and a browser at once during class - this holds up to the task well without getting bogged down.Long Battery Life:My school requires we use our laptops at all times - even our written exams take place on our laptops in a lockdown browser. Getting a seat next to an outlet is pretty competitive, but it's not a big concern for me with this. My class days are about 12 hours long, which is unreasonable to expect a laptop to last that long, but at least I only need to plug in once a day. It charges pretty quick, too.Convertible!:It's very handy to be able to flip it into tablet mode during lab, or pitch it in tent mode so I can look at my notes easily while practicing hands-on techniques.Ink option in Word:It is awesome to flip it into tablet mode, grab a stylus, and doodle neuro pathways or effects of nerve lesions in class. I'm a visual and tactile learner, so this is a great for that.Motion detector:The motion detector option is great - you can flip thru powerpoint slides with the wave of a hand. It's perfect for while I'm practicing on someone and my hands are covered with lotion.Right? This laptop is ridiculously perfect for physical therapists.Now for the downsides...Windows 8:A pain in the ass at first, but I got the hang of it... resentfully...WIFI:It had wifi connectivity issues (as many reviewers have noted before me), but since downloading the latest driver (that only comes with updating to Windows 8.1), I actually haven't had a problem. [Update: wifi problems are back a couple months after I updated. According to the Lenovo forums, I'm not the only one. A few people said Lenovo Support is now completely replacing the wifi card when you send it in, and that fixed the problem. I guess I'll try that!]Touch Screen Angst:The touch screen function is finicky in the corners, but it's not something I notice until I try to close a window. It's also not a problem if you're running the app version of something (like running the app for Chrome instead of using it on your desktop)Touchy Touch Pad:This thing is hyperactive, loves to double click, and NO, changing the settings doesn't help (everyone tells me that.) Per someone else's recommendation on a review for this laptop, I bought a decal (just search Amazon for \"Lenovo Yoga 13 decal\" and you'll get a ton of results. I bought mine from \"decalrus\"). I'm only using the keypad decal and it works really well! There's still an unintended-double click issue, but it's intermittent and the pad overall is much less sensitive. Plus, the decal has skulls and stuff so I can feel like a badass.Overall, I definitely recommend it! Especially for a student - med students, PT students, etc would really love it. I know it's pricey - I actually bought mine refurbished from Lenovo's Outlet website. It's cheaper that way, but the downside is that you can't buy a warranty until AFTER the first year of use.My recommended modifications/purchases:Update to WIndows 8.1 and update the wireless driver to fix the connectivity issuesBuy a good stylusBuy a decal for your keypadBuy a silicone keyboard cover so crap doesn't get in the keys", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Touch Screen Need Work", "Author": "Luis Bonilla", "ReviewID": "R31WXJ4I7J7S8L", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The reason for the rating is when the system is used as tablet closing or open programs becomes difficult and at times it doesn't respond and I have to tab it several times.

I was researching Macbook Pro 13\" and an Alienware 13\".  I was dead-set on size - 15\" was too big and 11\" was too small.  I was very close to buying the MB Pro when I learned of these new convertible tablets.  Looking at the specs - they are similar or better than the MB Pro for a lesser price!  So I decided to go with the Lenovo Yoga 13\".I actually wanted the Lenovo Twist, which I ordered directly from Lenovo.  This is because the Twist had options for a much beefier machine (faster, more capacity).  But after 3 months of waiting, I cancelled the order.  I vouwed never to buy FROM Lenovo.  It just so happened that I was walking through Best Buy one day and I saw the Yoga being sold there.  The specs were too miniscule - 2 GB RAM, Core I5 . . . I wanted more.  So I went on BBuy.com and saw that they sell the Core I7 w/4GB RAM . . . that's good enough for me, so I ordered it site-to-store.  I was so excited about getting this new, revolutionary CONVERTIBLE laptop that I forgot to look at the little things that matter to me . . .TRACKPAD - The macbook trackpad is smooth and ALWAYS responds EXACTLY as you want it to.  The Lenovo did a decent job of attempting to simulate the macbook trackpad, but it only got abuot 70% of the way there.  It responds to double-finger scroll, but it is actually opposite of what you're accustomed to.  It's like when you're playing a FPS, and you have the option to invert the y-axis.  Except the Yoga does not give you an option, they just decided that scrolling down with your fingers scrolls up on the screen!  You get used to it, but it kinda sucks when you have the Yoga and your wife has a macbook - you get annoyed every time you switch from one to the other!  The Yoga trackpad has it's own type of swipe recognition.  It uses the edge-swipes that are built into Windows 8.  It's annoying - I don't like the edge swipes in Windows 8, they're not very useful.  I miss the 3-finger swipe from my macbook.BODY COMPOSITION - The body on the Yoga is rather flimsy.  I am afraid it will snap or crack in the next 2 years.  We'll see.KEYBOARD - The Keyboard is NOT backlit, as it is on the Macbook.  However, the characters on the keys do a great job at reflecting off the screen when in laptop mode.  Besides, you can resort to using the on-screen keyboard if you really want to!If you can get past these things, then go ahead and go for the Yoga.
