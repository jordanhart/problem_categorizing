It is the only PC I've seen small enough to carry anywhere, but still be functional.  That's where it's great and worth $900 for those willing and able to spend so much.  On the other hand, it is too small to serve as my primary laptop.  I bought an Asus eeePC when it first came out.  The keyboard is narrower than the Sony, and I could never get used to it.  While it is very small, the Sony is much shorter and thinner and easier to carry, and the AC adapter is tiny.  Like other Sony laptops, and unlike most Windows laptops, the screen is very bright.  The smallness of the fonts is not a problem in browsing and most programs because the font size can be adjusted easily enough without any major tradeoff.  Other programs, like Outlook, and working within Windows are much more eye challenging.  I've owned four or so Sony laptops over the years and always liked their size, aesthetics, and screens, but they are Windows machines and don't begin to compare with the MacBook Air, which is by far the best laptop I've ever had (which goes back over 20 years).  If and when Apple has a product comparable to the Sony Vaio P, I'll likely be one of the first purchasers.", "Date": "April 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Wow what great little laptop!", "Author": "Ruth", "ReviewID": "R3CXTRUPM2U27", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros - A great little laptop that you can fit in your purse or large pocket. Its very easy to use and I installed alot of programs with out any trouble. Even my husband who doesn't like small fine print fell in love with it. Some say it boots up slow but mine always boots in about a minute which is fast enough for me.Cons - The battery is not 4 hours but only about 2 so buy the extended battery with it to stay in business longer.Fine Print took a little time to get use to.Mouse is different but you a just fast to it.I wish it had more usb ports but you always can buy a device to make more.No cd rom drive but you can buy it external.Over all I would diffential buy this computer again.

As soon as my notebook arrived I tried out the keypad and it was a perfect fit for my fingers however, the scroller implanted into the keypad is a little bit hard for me to control, I would strongly recommend something easier to command by.Now the software (windows vista) is brilliant, my parents have a mac and the software on there is boring, but with windows vista it is amazing . What i adore about the features on the software is the \"Windows movie maker\" it is awesome I love making home-made little videos of my dogs.  And also the search widget on the start program.

First of all, it's over priced, you should get at least 120gb hard drive!  Half the space is already gone before it's delivered to your door.  The screen is pretty small, it's really hard to read at times, you can increase the screen size on Windows Explorer but that makes it hard to navigate through the pages. Secondly, I can never use it for an extended amount of time because it freezes. I have to shut it down and reboot !  I haven't loaded anything on it because there isn't room so I'm not taking up any space.  It also crashes and reboots on its own, I'll get some kind of crazy blue screen.  Also, regardless of where I am, when I'm using the internet, it decides to disconnect or give me a limited connectivity messages. Lastly and worst of all, the screen cracked!  Not sure if the dog or one of the kids stepped on it but I opened the screen and it looks cracked with broken pixels.  Called Sony, because I figured it would still be under warranty and was told it's not covered!  Had the same thing happen with my Dell computer and they fixed it with no problem, no questions asked!  Then, these people at Sony had the nerve to tell me that a new screen would cost around $600!!! That's over half of what I paid for this piece of garbage!  Oh well, you live and learn.  Don't buy anything because it's \"CUTE\".  That's really the only reason I did.

However, I felt complied to write about my experience with my machine.Wanting a inexpensive laptop for college, I got a Sony Vaio N-Series. At first I thought, \"this thing rocks!\" A large screen, nice roomy keyboard. By the end of the semester my thoughts changed dramatically.First thing that charged my opinion on Sony: I accidentally dropped a small aerosol can of hair mousse on my lappy. The force was so great that the hard drive \"popped out\" of place. The campus technology director said that cannot be the case...usually laptop hard drives are protected to vast degrees. A small, light weight can should not have dislodged the hard drive. Long story short the hard drive had to be replaced via the dislodged--all from a 7oz can of hair mousse. Apparently Sony can really protect them hard drives!Second thing: The battery life. On one charge the battery lasts about 45 minutes. That's with the screen dimmed.Lastly: The plug-in wall charger. It's been three years since I took my laptop out of the box. For about two years the charger worked great...fully energized the laptop etc. Until this year. One day, while doing my daily web page viewing, the charger \"blew-up\" and refused. I had to purchase an after-market replacement. Just my luck, so I thought. However, a few days ago my mom's (more expensive) Sony Vaio charger blew-up as well. So it is not just me.Do not get me wrong. Sony has created some awesome products and other laptops.
