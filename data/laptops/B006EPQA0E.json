It is fast and reliable. Screen is beautiful. I love mine. It is definitely way sturdier than other lap tops I have owned, I don't feel like I am going to snap the screen off when opening it like my last lap top, nothing bad to say... if your looking for an awesome lap top here you go", "Date": "June 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Little Computer", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2SW49CK9ZDKI9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Dell Inspiron to replace an older desktop model.  The file transfer utilities for Windows did a pretty good job of handling most of the program transfers although some of the applications had to be reinstalled.  Not bad all things considered.  What few gripes i had were centered around Windows, not the Dell.  The screen is sharp; start-up time is pretty fast; the key board feels good; and disk access is quick. All-in-all, this is a great little computer.", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Has worked just great", "Author": "Norm \"Amazon Aficionado\"", "ReviewID": "R2VRVPNVOEGGCA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Quality construction.

My warranty ended on 15th may and just before that I got issue in web camera. It is still in Dell depo. Dell support is denying support now. It was biggest mistake I purchased this laptop.", "Date": "May 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice bit of kit. No problems at all", "Author": "Hooper0408", "ReviewID": "R2B073QXBTPUB3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have had this laptop over a year now and can honestly say it hasn't had one hiccup. Used it for video and photo editing, bit of gaming and has never let me down. As long as you keep the system clean it should keep you going for years. The screen itself is vibrant and letters are nice and sharp(need to be with my eyes). Have recommended buying this laptop to my friends now and they have had no issues with theirs three having bought the same model. I am very happy with my laptop and would recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "April 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Bad computer", "Author": "teresa baker", "ReviewID": "R33EYW3BM5SXXH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this in Feb. 2012. After my year was up I have had nothing but problems with this laptop. They have replaced the hard drive once, the motherboard 2 times, the lcd screen, cable, keyboard, and still having major graphics problem. It will freeze up with the screen jumping all over the place. Fixing to call again as I just got it back on Fri and it did it again so they didnt fix it. Going to bring up a lemon contract and demand another computer. This is a piece of junk.

I bought a wireless printer at the same time - over half the time when I want to print something I have to carry the machine back into the office, plug the cable in, and re-install the wireless connection.  4 hours on the phone with a customer service rep did not solve the problem.  I have a wireless setup to my speakers (the built in speaker in the Inspiron is terrible) but I have to unplug and replug the connection every time I try to play music to get the Inspiron to transmit through it.  Even then, it occasionally cuts out.The computer came pre-loaded with lots of garbage that is very hard to get rid of - many of those extra options do not include a refusal button - Every time I reboot, I have to go to the task manager and \"end task\" to get the software pop-ups to leave me alone.Because of all the garbage software, it actually takes this machine twice as long to boot up and get started as the \"obsolete\" desktop - which I am going to reconnect tomorrow.This machine is much too large and heavy to use as a portable, and it does not work as a replacement for the desktop.  It is slow and clunky and the most frustrating computer I have ever used.Part of the problem is the current release of Windows, which exacerbates the worst features of the Inspiron.Dell used to sell a clean, functional product, but obviously that is no longer their company philosophy.  I do not intend ever to buy another Dell product.", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "bad product, bad screen", "Author": "RAMON", "ReviewID": "R3UTQXISA04G2L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "bad product, bad screen the saller dont return my money i lost money buyed it.
