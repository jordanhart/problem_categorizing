{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I'm impressed", "Author": "Douglas Baxter", "ReviewID": "R2Q26149TP3BW3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just got the NP900X3D a couple days ago from Amazon.Initial impressions: I love it, irritated with a few small items, but it is my new favorite travel computer.The packaging was great.  Three layers of protection: Amazon box with plastic air, Samsung box with foam corners inside, and then a very hard, elegant notebook box with foam inside.Since I've only had it a few days, I'll keep the review short for now:Good things:++ The matte screen is gorgeous.  I'm sitting in the kitchen next to an open window with the sunlight pouring in, and it looks just fine.  Really good, in fact.  My mother-in-law is sitting beside me with an Asus that has a reflective screen.  Ouch!  The glare from her notebook smacked me in the face.  The screen on the Sammy is awesome.++ Super skinny and light.  This is replacing my daily notebook, a lightweight (3.94 lbs) Asus that I thought was very portable.  Hah!  The Sammy blows it away.++ Elegant and refined look and feel.Irritating things:-- Storage space.  OMG.  Over half is gone on arrival.  Do they really need 4 different recovery partitions?  One of which consumes 25 GB?  At first I was shocked, but I've mellowed a little now.  Just a little.  I've created a backup image (which is a little tricky to find in Windows 8), and may consider blowing away this build.  Or upgrading to a 256 GB drive, like the M4 mSATA from Crucial.-- Wifi and automatic brightness.  Neither worked well out of the box.  But, after running the Samsung SW Update (all apps, Samsung section), it seems fine now.  Thinking about it, most new computers need to be fine-tuned and updated when you get them, so this doesn't bother me too much.Well, that's my initial impressions.  I'm completely new to Windows 8, and at first found it quite strange.  But the more I play with it, the more I see advantages.  I get both the desktop and an app interface.  And there are definitely some cool apps out there.  Windows 8 starts out in more of a sharing layout than I personally like, but that's just customization, and we all do that.Update 5/6/2013:* Tried it outside on the porch and the screen worked great on a sunny day.* Installed 10 GB of pictures and MS Office.  I'll probably load another 10 GB in music, and then one or two movies.  I guess everything will fit fine for now.  Maybe I wanted more elbow room than I need.* Still having intermittent problems with wifi connectivity.  It works most the time, but occasionally drops out.  My router is in the basement, so it may be that the signal is only fair.* Registering with Samsung added 3 months to the warranty.  I know, a pittance, but better than nothing.  Brings it up to 15 months.Update 8/25/2013:* Bottom line - I still love this laptop, and it's staying with me.* Wifi - There are several Ultrabook models that have a problematic Intel wifi card, and this model is one of them.  The Intel Centrino Advanced N-6235 wifi card can cause connections issues and dropouts.  Intel is supposedly working on a driver fix.  Mine works fine after de-installing the Intel ProSet Suite, but YMMV.  Important point:  If you are not comfortable changing software drivers, then I would NOT recommend this notebook for you.  That was hard to say, because I really like this notebook.* It does get a little warm on the lap after a while.* I have 20 GB of free space after loading all my files, apps, music, videos, pictures, and several movies.  And like many people, I have a lot of pictures and music.", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great chassis - buggy drivers", "Author": "Jennifer Johnson", "ReviewID": "R1K48I6D557ZKZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "LOVE the form of this laptop - sleek and lightweight! I like the back lighting of the keyboard. I wish that the volume controls and screen brightness were not controlled by the Fn keys requiring 2 hands to control, though.As others have mentioned, there ARE issues with the wireless adapter and touchpad. If you believe your Windows based laptop should run perfectly out of the box - stay away from this laptop. I knew going into this purchase that there were problems and decided to gamble on my being able to address them. I am reasonably comfortable doing this, but not a techie. With the help of the Samsung support, I have reinstalled/updated the drivers for the wireless adapter (x3) and touchpad. The adapter appears to be OK now, the touchpad continues to annoy, refusing to work when the computer is restored from \"sleep\" mode. Because the reboot is so fast, this is only annoying not unworkable.  Also, the default power settings required adjustment and often revert back to default - not sure why.All in all, for me - the form of the chassis and other design features make this a great little laptop as a road warrior. The frustration factor of the above, though, does not allow me to recommend this as a \"buy\" without some reservation.", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Ultrabook for under $1000", "Author": "G. Trimble", "ReviewID": "R341PEL2CIS2NA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched all the latest lightweight laptops to replace an aging Acer 12\" Netbook.  Needed something to travel with and use around the house.  Wanted a 6+hour battery, 3 lbs or less and 13\" screen.  This 13\" ultrabook is almost 1/2 lb lighter at  2.5 lbs than my older netbook and weighs the same as my wife's Ipad with keyboard.  The screen is very bright and sharp.  Computer is quiet and sleek looking, Macbook Air imitation. Battery is good for 6-8 hours. Computer boots up in seconds with the 128GB SSD.  Wish it had a 256 GB SSD but 128GB will do the job and is a lot more than the Ipad offers.  I did not like the Windows 8 interface so installed a simple app that replicated Windows 7 menu on startup.  This computer should last me for another 5+ years.", "Date": "May 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Macbook Air killer!", "Author": "D. Chieng", "ReviewID": "R1WV6GKVR8IM8Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Once you set up the windows 8 look and feel the way you wanted and disable some of the actions of the touchpad, it works great. Bootup from powerup or sleep is sooooo fast. This thing is so thin and yet sturdy. Screen is awesome! Anti-glare screen, awesome, may be the only highend ultrabook with anti-glare screen. I absolutely hate glossy screen. Most windows 8 apps are low quality and very few decent ones. Touchpad works fine for desktop apps, but some windows 8 apps are a little flacky with the touchpad.Recovery saved me a few times. Some old software do not work properly and would not uninstall and will cause repeated pop up error msg in Windows 8. The only way out for me was to use \"Recovery\" app to bring my system back to the previous state. It works remarkably well. So I would say SSD space allocated for Recovery is a must have if you ever corrupt your system unintentionally.", "Date": "May 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "garbage", "Author": "dadagiri", "ReviewID": "R1EMUKX0XR6B63", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "bought this about a month ago.

I use it primarily as a work computer, to write consultations and letters, to create slides for lectures, and to organize and analyze clinical and financial data.  It is extremely thin, light, and portable, and its design and construction are impeccable.  It has a very premium look and feel, and I always receive compliments about it from my colleagues.  The display is beautiful, with great clarity and color representation.  The keyboard layout and the key travel are perfect, and typing on this computer is always a pleasure.  The trackpad is very responsive, and it supports all of the commonly-used gestures.  The processor and the solid state drive are excellent, and they provide very rapid startup, and tremendous computing power, enabling me to accomplish my work quickly and efficiently.  Battery life is superb, ranging from seven to eight hours on a charge.  The Samsung Series 9 NP900X3D-A04US 13.3-Inch Premium Ultrabook is an outstanding computer, and it can function both as a desktop equivalent, as well as a mobile office for the frequent business traveler.  Therefore, I give this Samsung Series 9 Ultrabook my very highest recommendation!  Kenneth L.

(that samsung wont replace because they are acceptable for them)- the speakers sound make vibrating the case so the keyboard keys so much that produce a loud \"frying food\"/\"mosquito\" noise.- worse of all the display:The color balance of yellow/purple is distorted. The yellow is too high and magenta low, making it appear the faces in the movies, all yellowish (even the actors' lips). Very frustrating.the purple color become blue or pale purple.I made the comparison with other 5-LED LCD screens I have at home: laptop sony, acer external monitor, external monitor samsung, samsung TV and a smartphone sony  as I screened a  purple picture on all the panels the only panle diplay blue instead of violet was this laptop samsung.I have been to the shop and I compared sample pictures with the series9 available in the shop having the same type of panel (1600x900) and also compared to other PC exposed (asus and sony) it came out that is not only my laptop but all samsung series 9 so seems to be a congenital problem on all monitors of this resolution 1600x900. Even the salesman was shocked for the poor quality, and he suggested me to request a monitor upgrade or a full refund.- (Dimmer) The monitor light does not come down with the dusk light exterior while the keyboard lights up. the monitor brightness does not change as it should. which he did in the early days of use.- when I use an external monitor connected to VGA adapter dongle original samsung, external monitor occasionally (about 10 minutes) makes a flash on screen. quite annoying. I tested the external monitor by connecting it to another laptop via VGA port: no problem in the external display. so the problem is from the PC.- Blue screens. (System crash)since I use this PC to have occurred about 15 blue screens in 3-4 months of use (even immediately after the complete system restore ).I note that with my old laptop sony ,where I had installed many more software blue screen, have happened to me 1 or 2 times in 5 years.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Its pretty nice", "Author": "BRUNO JORGE SOARES", "ReviewID": "RRGUNFVWGSCFY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Its working, its thin , its fast, its beautiful, it substitutes my ipad to see videos, read news and send emails", "Date": "June 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome design but some flaws like other reviews mentioned", "Author": "J.J.", "ReviewID": "R1Q5A35B8ZQPKW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted to absolutely love this computer (supporting motherland products :). I do agree with some of the reviews I read prior to purchasing this (I've had this for just under a year):Some cons:- Some of my pixels have died on my screen (white spots that are barely noticeable, but I DO notice them in certain lights)- Trackpad stopped functioning after an update; I had to down-grade my driver and now I'm too scared to update my computer because I'm not sure they are 'safe' upgrades (I had to downgrade my drivers twice after 2 separate upgrades).

This is dimming my screen down all the way and not streaming anything else; just work and regular wifi.Pros:- The lightness of the computer- truly ultrabook- The overall look- The keyboard is easy to get used to (some reviews complained about the shallow-ness of the keys but I got used to it-- regular keyboards take extra effort from me now)", "Date": "May 6, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00B588J6I"}}
