An \"Administrators\" account is a backdoor route viruses/malware uses get in and cause unrecoverable distruction to your data. With Admin rights those malware can easily infect deep within your \"recovery partitions'! meaning, these's not turning back and you're royally screwed. Theres many more problems that can happen but I think you already get my point.GOALS: 1) Don't use your Main MS Account as an\" Adminitrator\" but instead \"standard\"  2) Create a secondary account called \"local account\" and set that up as the Administrator instead.Account Management: steps creating a local account(administrator) and MS Account(standard)Charms search: type\"control panel\" > \"User's Accounts and Family Safety\" > \"Remove User account\" > \" Add a new user in PC settings \" located at bottom of window > Bringing you to Metro > click \"add Account\" > \"Sign in without MS accout\" located at bottom of page > \"Local Accout\" > create new user name and PWYou have 2 options on Signing IN1) Microsoft account or 2) Local Account1) Create or sign in with your MAIN Microsoft Account. If you already an MS account or uses windows phones/ xbox live or Hotmail/live/MSN email address you can use these as well to link those services to 1 master MS Account.2) Create a Local Account. Thise secondary account will not connect to MS's ecosytem but only in your local computer. I identical to USERS login on Windows 7,Vista,XP etc.Once you've setup these two accounts, you must set each account type to: >Change ACCOUNT TYPE for Main MS Account to \"Standard\"Change ACCOUNT TYPE for 2ndary Local Account to \"Administrator\"Please do these steps, it only takes 5minutes.  Its a small price to pay considering, it may  potentially rescue your entire data from a completely erasing your data after sending it for repairs.__________________________________________________________________________Making Back ups/ EtcAnother tip is to make a recovery image.First install Setup all your programs , setup your custom settings, etcAfter personalizing your PC.  > Its time to Create a Recovery Image right after you've set everything up.  This image will allow you to revert back to this pc's state in time, and in perfect working order.Sometimes system recovery doesn't solve your problems so having secondary backup plan like Recovery Image is key.________________________________________________________________________Not optional, must practice these 3 regular computing habits.#1  (Install McAfee Antivirus, which is now free starting 2014, per Intel's 2014 Keynote at CES) or Paid programs such as Kaspersky Internet Security 2014  is the leading software in the market today. $50.  These programs scans your system automatically, so set it and forget it.#2  (Install MalwareBytes/free, scan your pc every month with this program or sooner when you feel like your system is sluggish or seeing webpages poping up that you didnt click)  Because this is a free software, as a user you must manually start the scaning process or by buying retail version you'll unlock the auto scan scheduler feature.#3  (Install Superantispyware/free, Scan pc every 2wks)Because this is a free software, as a user you must manually start the scaning process or by buying retail version you'll unlock the auto scan scheduler feature.Its ok skip a few scans between months, although not advisable, especially if your a heavy web surfing maniac spending 2-3 hrs daily websurfing not just facebooking.  But please dont go without using all 3 programs more than 5-8 Months in between scans.________________________________________________________________________Another way to avoid  spreading your personal information out there into the wild unknowingly is to un-google yourself.yes ladies and gents! google or yahoo especially yahoo LOL..... but google is key here.Microsoft sells Primarily Software.Apple sells Primarily HardwareGoogle sells neither, that's why their products are so CHEAP, once they suckered in their backdoor ridden ecosystem, Google Inc. sells Primarily Everything about YOU!_____________________________________________________________________________________________________Steps in upgrading from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1  (2-3hrs)Key here is to ensure your windows 8 is fully updated before upgrading to win8.1Therefore repeatedly \"check of updates\" on windowsHow to upgrade to windows 8.1 for dummies.Step 1: Go to Metro and not desktopStep 2: Start typing : \"Control Panel\"Step 3: Click \"Windows Update\" > \"Check for Update\"Step 4: install updatesStep 5: restart computerStep 6: Repeat step 1 -5 until result \"no more updates\"Step 7: Run HP Update client, install all updates from HP to ensure all drivers and bugfixes are updated.( or whichever OEM you may have, lenovo,dell, sony etc.)Step 8: Uninstall your Antivirus Software (important) then RESTART PCStep 9: Go to Windows Store and upgrade to 8.1Step 10: leave computer on for 2hrs as it upgrades.Step 11: Repeat Steps 1 - 7Step 12: if you're not a complete fool, 8.1 upgrade should be straight forward. \\After steps 1-8 ONLY THEN you should install WIndows 8.1 at the marketplace. Goodluck.(note: steps above removes a lot of failures users experience after 8.1 update)___________________________________________________________Not many want to shell out their dollars on Office 360  if all they intend of using is standard word processors.you can use a free web version of office calledBing.com search:  \"MS Office Web Apps\"just sign in with the same  MS Account user name used on your PC.", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great price and fast laptop", "Author": "Willy Henry Chaves S\u00e1nchez", "ReviewID": "R215B9V6KVJOKJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great price and product, fast, and I highly recommend it.

My previous laptop was just dying because it couldn't handle the workload anymore and so far this has been great despite what I'm running on it.  Size is a little bit bigger than expected and the weight matches my expectations.  Design-wise, I like how the keyboard is very quiet and how easy it is to type and manage the track pad.  Touch screen is something that I wasn't necessarily looking for, but based on the 1-2 times I've ever touched the screen, it does seem responsive.CONS:Windows 8.  Seriously I've had this for weeks and I have not been able to make good use of the OS.  I can't bring it to Windows 7, which sucks.  Also, the touch screen seems to add a few inches to the sides.  So the frame is about half an inch on each side, and then there's an extra quarter inch per side before the actual visible part of the desktop shows up.  Kind of hard to describe.OVERALLGreat laptop overall and it has a few more features than what I need.

It's a great buy and meets all of my computer needs. The only problem I had was with the shipping specifics. The item was marked \"If not home leave outside\".

The build quality is so poor. The hinges are weak plastic and within a few months the screen cracked and the weak plastic hinges bent and broke. This is with reasonable wear.I guess with HP Pavilions you get a cheaper price and cheaper parts.  Expect to replace it within a year or so.Also their tech service is terrible. They kind of blame the user for any thing that breaks and youll expect to be on the phone for 5 hours with a guy named Anish from India.  They really take forever to replace something at HP and their quailty is terrible.I only gave it 2 stars because of the price.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GH6TZHU"}}
