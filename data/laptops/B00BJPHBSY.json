{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great light-weight notebook", "Author": "Upharia", "ReviewID": "R3AEPVRFBGFW3W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop in need of a light weight computer that would run all of my programs for college. I wasn't looking for a powerful or super-fast PC. With that being said, this computer fits the bill. I have had it for just over a month and have really enjoyed learning windows 8.A few thoughts that I've noticed:-one time the touchscreen froze with the little touch \"dot\" stuck on the screen. I had to restart when this happened. It has only happened once so far.-this computer is very light (just under 3 lbs) and I was afraid the charger would be a huge, heavy thing like my old laptop. I was surprised to see that the charger is tiny and lightweight as well.-once you have a touchscreen laptop you will forever try to touch every screen even when it's not a touchscreen.-this computer is not super-fast. Sometimes it doesn't load flash-filled or complex sites very fast. It's not anything that has been a hindrance to me (I don't game or web surf except it school).-this laptop looks and feels amazing. The brushed aluminum keeps the exterior cool. This laptop never gets hot. (I had to sit with it in my lap for 4 hours and it was barely warm)- the screen has a lot I glare. I just got an anti glare protector. Problem solved.", "Date": "August 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Takes the worry out of portability.", "Author": "Patricia Bynoe", "ReviewID": "R1L9WULAARBTHB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is an excellent tool for my projects. It looks really attractive, I got the portability and ease of use  found in a tablet and I have the power and function of a lap-top computer. I am now able to interact anyhow I please with my Asus Vivobook. Because of it's size, I can carry it very easily in my regular shoulder bag without bulk or weight. Downside: I am trying to get over the limitations of the tablet function on a laptop; trying to figure out how to find everything and make them work. I suppose  Windows 8 OS is partly to blame for my difficulties. All-in-all I expect it will serve me well.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$795.15", "Features": "Intel\u00ae CoreTM i5-3317U 1.8GHz  Processor - Mobile Intel\u00ae HM76 Express Chipset\n11.6\" 16:9 HD/GL/LED (1366x768) Display, Touchscreen -Integrated Intel\u00ae HD Graphics\n4GB DDR3 DDR3-1333 Mhz SO-DIMM OnBoard Memory - 500 GB 5400RPM 2.5\" SATA Hard Disk\nIntegrated 802.11 b/g/n - USB 3.0 - HDMI - Built-in BluetoothTM V4.0 - Black\nHD Web Camera - Windows 8 - 1 YR Global ASUS Warranty", "Name": "Asus VivoBook X202E-DH51T 11.6\" Touchscreen LED Notebook Computer, Intel Core i5-3317U 1.7GHz, 4GB DDR3 RAM, 500GB HDD, Windows 8 Home Premium", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41OVVvFtbQL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BJPHBSY"}}
