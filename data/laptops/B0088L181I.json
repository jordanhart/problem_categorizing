{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Ultrabook with a Major Keyboard Flaw", "Author": "Jason R. Sabovich \"Sabo\"", "ReviewID": "R38A662J5GHOMT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Overall the Vizio CT14-A1 is a solid Ultra book.  It is extremely fast, the screen is beautiful and its very light.  The design of the laptop is elegant and it is very well built, similar to a MacBook Air (solid aluminum chassis).  I installed Windows 8 about a week ago, and its made the laptop even faster.  Like others mention, the keyboard is very light and it feels significantly different from the Dell laptop I'm used to.  My only real complaint with the computer is also with the keyboard.  It has a propensity to double letters and not acknowledge when the shift key is pressed.  Other reviewers have mentioned this as well.  It doesn't do it often, or consistently, but I do notice it occasionally.As far as I know the only difference between the CT14-A1 and the CT14-A4 is the windows version.  When upgrading to Windows 8 I did have to find the drivers for the wireless NIC by doing a google search and manually installing them.  I am also using a USB to LAN adapter to speed up my internet connection, although the wireless also works great.I was a little concerned about gaming performance due to the Intel 4000 integrated graphics.  Overall it's adequate for light gaming.  It's runs graphics intensive games like World of tanks at 1600x900 on low settings with 25+ frames per second.Pros +Beautiful construction +Fast for everyday uses (<15 sec boot thanks to the SSD) +Great screen with 1600x900 resolution + 2x USB 3.0 ports, 1x HDMI + Good 802.11N wireless + Able to handle light/moderate gamingCons - Keyboard is lacking in precision (This is a major problem if you have to write more than a few sentences) - 128GB SSD requires you to use \"cloud\" storage or an external Hard drive - Keyboard is not backlit (it really should be for this type of computer) - Limited ports (No SD card reader or RJ-45 LAN port)Update 7 January 2013.I've used the laptop for a week now and have reduced my review to 3 stars.  The reason is the keyboard.  The problem with repeating keys can be fixed using the keyboard delay setting in Windows control panel.  The problem with the keys not registering when pressed cannot.  Simply put, each key must be squarely pressed or there is a good chance it won't register.  This is a hardware problem and I do not believe a driver fix can solve this.  I attempted to write an essay using this laptop and became so irritated with the constant failures of the keyboard to register keystrokes that I plugged an old dell USB keyboard in, which works perfectly.  The quality of the keyboard is inexcusable.  My six-year old dell laptop's keyboard feels worse while typing, but functions properly.  I'm past the 30-day return so I have ordered a laptop stand and will use a standalone keyboard when I have to type anything.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "I like it", "Author": "James R. Lieffort", "ReviewID": "R3OSAIJEQ8YAJK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Have had it about a week, I'm writing this review with it. It's super light, boots in 17 secs. The screen is awesome, very bright. I tried an HP folio 13, the screen on the Visio is much better. I consider myself pretty hard to please but for my needs  which are simple, very important to me bright screen that's easy to read, good battery life, thin, fast, powerful enough for anything I want to do. This fits the bill perfectly. I have no real need for an SD card. If I need a port it has 2 USB's. I also have and external USB optical drive, but I never needed it. I have it set up just the way I like. There are a few things I haven't figured out. How do I disable the touch pad when typing? I occasionally  get \"cursor jump\". According to the Viso help key there is a way but I can't seem to find it. The keyboard is really light, it take some getting used to. The only other thing I don't like is it's so thin, I sometimes struggle to open it. I imagine this will get better as the hinge loosens a bit. Did I mention I have big hands. Hey I bought it early so I took a chance. I knew if I waited another 6 months I would get a better deal, but isn't that true with all your technology purchases. I have had good luck with my other Visio products and this one did not disappoint me.

SSD not included. Microsoft Surface, returned it. Win 8 RT wont run m programs. Got a Vizio ct a0  i3  14\" 128 SSD Love it. Keyboard and mouse have issues but I am using a Bluetooth keyboard for the most part and have updated the drivers ,It helped somewhat. Great entry into the laptop market from first time laptop maker Vizio. I am satisfied with my purchase, No return. It is hard to make me happy. Vizio did it.Apple stock is dropping.

However, right out of the box the trackpad was an issue so I ordered an optical mouse.  I was just starting to get acquainted and created my first PowerPoint presentation and it locked up 5 minutes before my meeting. I tried everything as well as going online for solutions.  I talked to a computer shop and wouldn't touch it because I told them I had it only 3 weeks.
