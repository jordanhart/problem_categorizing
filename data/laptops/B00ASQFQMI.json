I have owned several quality laptops and after heavy debate I decided to see what this Toshiba could do. I am pleased beyond compare.... twice, no, three times the machine I expected. great design, keyboard, mouse, features etc etc. I had a machine that I paid twice the price for and I lived with the glitches, poor design and battery life for 3 years before purchasing this laptop. Fortunately, my older machine was dropped breaking the display and now I get to enjoy this new laptop.

The mouse is sticky sometimes or you can't even see it on the screen.  Toshiba loads it up with a lot of unnecessary bloatware.  With four gigs of memory I was always crashing Chrome, until I deleted all the preloaded junkware.I have ordered more memory for it, that may help.  Would not order this machine without at least 8 gigs of memory.Price was pretty good, but i would not recommend this to anyone, too hard to make it run like it should.", "Date": "August 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "satellite connection is great!", "Author": "P.

Windows 8 takes some time getting used to it but it's not as difficult as some people say.  The computer is very lightweight and portable.

It's not designed for lots of fancy graphics editing or video editing or amazing game play it designed to do all of a computers basic functions efficiently. ( type, Internet , music, videos etc.). I would recommend and USB external drive with this unit to keep the interal hard drive free of clutter because after you put about 250gigs on unit it becomes VERY slow.  But it you use and external drive it functions perfectly.  This unit was priced at 220$ when I purchased it and still can't believe it works as well as it does.  One thing that is really terrible is the internal speakers. They barely get loud enough to hear in a quite room but simply fixed with a wireless or wired set of speakers.", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Okay", "Author": "Ashes", "ReviewID": "R30RTVLXS5DLCZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Not bad for the price . . . .

This caused a 5 day delay, but it wasn't a big deal.The computer itself, its great.  Lightweight, took less than 5 mins to register and get up and running.  Windows 8 is a pain in the butt to get used to, but I will adjust.  It's quick and has a good battery life.

I called and was told they would help me back up some expensive software I had on the computer. They never said they would charge me for help backing up the computer before sending it in. Luckily, I asked if there would be a charge and they finally admitted there would be.  I was then told I would be charged $25  to send in the computer even though the cooling system is a known hardware issue with their computers. I called and was told by customer service that shipping was free - on the return trip back. I had to pay the $25 and there was nothing they would do. Their customer service was not only useless, but also was consistently misleading.Next time I will buy from a company that stands behind its products - like HP or Dell.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love hate relationship.", "Author": "Brenda Williams \"brenbb\"", "ReviewID": "R1K61TXN4WVS3L", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Laptop is O.K.  the good thing about it, if you do not use for about five minutes, it shuts off, that's energy saver power, however, it takes forever to power up, once you turn it on, it takes up to 10-15 minutes to power up.

I'm highly disappointed in Toshiba's service.
