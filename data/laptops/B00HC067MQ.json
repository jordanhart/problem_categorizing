I would recommend to anyone looking for a home laptop.  The only thing is that you can't do is so far is use previous Microsoft Office Setup on this one,  It had all the ports I needed, I love the numeric keypad.

I did too, at first. Something told me not to write a review write away because if I had, I would have given it 4 stars.The computer itself is easy to set-up and even pretty easy to navigate if you take the time to learn it. Even my son who literally just turned 2 years old figured out how to use the features he needed. Things were fine but only two weeks after I got it, it suddenly had to perform an update that completely kept me from using it for a full day. HP support was able to help me after a 2-3 hour call!Then only 2 weeks after this update it had to do it again. This time, it lasted a full day again but then HP was not as helpful as before. I talked to 3 different reps for 1-2 hours at a time; accessing my computer remotely, performing updates and troubleshooting. Eventually, it would power on but just not start windows. At some point it wouldn't even start anymore.  I wasn't able to use my computer for nearly a week then they finally suggested I send it to them. They sent me a box but with no pre-paid label like they said I would get. I asked could I just pay to ship it myself but they insisted I have to use their box with their label so they were sending another box. Sure enough, they sent me another box, also with no label.  Now over two weeks with no access to my computer I decided to turn to Square Trade. They guarantee they can fix your computer within 5 business days; they waited until the very last second and admitted defeat. There is no fixing my computer.I had this laptop for exactly one month so basically, I paid the cost of a 3-year warranty to rent a computer. I can pretty much tell because I chose a not-so-expensive laptop, HP had no intention on helping me. I will not make the mistake of going with them again.If you like this laptop, I'm happy for you but this is my experience so I had to share it.", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "laptop of my dreams", "Author": "robin fleming \"robin fleming\"", "ReviewID": "R2PZLN6UCLTOWL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this was a great investment....love all features and the touch screen is awesome....its perfect so far, had it a few months no problems.. but the downloads when you first turn it on was just a bit to much.. but i think all new laptops do this...so far i give it 5 stars", "Date": "May 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Loving my touchscreen laptop", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RMV8X1E7OWV4Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great little touch screen laptop.

Kling", "ReviewID": "R3DAVSR7IVM98P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the first laptop I have owned and my wife and I both are very satisfied with it overall.  It offers tremendous value for the price.  It is fast and responsive, touch screen is nice (took a while to get used to it), and is of good quality.  Windows 8.1 has some features we really like but we both are still learning all the ins and outs of it.  The only thing I have noticed that could be better is the speaker volume which is loud enough for most things, but doesn't have the ability to get super loud or for the best sound quality.  Otherwise, everything else has been superb for the price.  We are very impressed and happy with our purchase.", "Date": "May 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "An EXCELLENT touchscreen laptop", "Author": "Snowgator", "ReviewID": "R3MN4RA86BXDRV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "HP has a major bargin with this computer.  Well priced, this laptop has Windows 8.1 on it, and has a full touchscreen.  This makes a world of difference in the enjoyment of the new OS.  Windows 8 is designed for tablets, so including a touchscreen only makes sense.  It is a bright responsive screen.  The motions become second nature quickly.  Windows 8 is a great OS.  It does have a learning curve as it is a ton different from Windows 7, Vista, and XP, but it is fun and streamlined once you understand it.The keyboard is huge and I have no problem using it.  The speakers and the camera are both decent.  Skype is a great tool on this unit.  The size of the screen (15.6\") allows for great use of the touch feature.2 small gripes keep this from 5 stars:  It is a lower end computer, but even taking that into account I find the more complex actions (installing updates for example) to be sluggish.  Also, the amount of bloat that comes with this is much higher then other Win 7 and older devices I have bought.  Quite a bit of it is tougher to remove.  Also, it is a tad heavy.  To me, this is not a con, but if you need a lighter device you should keep that in mind.But with this price, you will not find too much better of a buy.  I have been on it for quite a bit of time and only I am becoming more and more spoiled.  There is no going back to anything smaller, and there will be only touchscreens in my future.
