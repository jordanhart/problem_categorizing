The hinge does not seem to work properly which caused the cheap material to crack. I talked to technical support and their supervisor. They basically accused me of damaging the laptop myself and even though it is still under warranty, I don't have the accidental insurance that it's not their problem. After insisting that it was not caused by an accident, they said I could sent them the laptop where they can inspect it and I would be without it for 7 to 9 days. I told them I could not be without it that long, and could fix it myself. I was told it is too complicated to let the customer do the repair. They should not engineer something to be so difficult, and if a customer feels confident enough to do the repair, they should have that choice. I guess I will have to deal with not being able to close the lid.", "Date": "May 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "When it works, it works. When it doesn't? Good luck.", "Author": "Katherine M Dedrick", "ReviewID": "R1EOBL37SDHX9L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Long winded. Bear with me.I purchased this laptop on 11/22/2012 because it seemed like an affordable option for my needs when I decided to go back to college. Honestly, I really hadn't had any issues with it until recently. About a week ago, I noticed that my battery icon had a red x over it, when I mouse over the icon it says it is plugged in and charging, but there is no charge on the battery, no matter how long I leave it plugged in. It won't turn on without the cord plugged in. Clearly, the battery is completely dead.I decide just to make sure, I'll have my husband double check. He works in IT for a large medical technology company, so surely he can determine if its the battery or some other malfunction. After going through the HP website for assistance and installing the \"HP Support Assistant\" software, he begins swearing loudly at my laptop. I inquire as to why, and he simply shows me my screen. The program has little boxes where the text is supposed to be, so it is completely useless.I figured it'd be okay, I'd contact HP, surely a battery isn't supposed to flat line within a year, right? I went through the steps to validate my warranty, and it turns out mine expired 8/29/13. Okay. Still no big deal. I'll just email a technician or begin a chat with them to see what steps I need to follow to have this repaired. I really feel I shouldn't have this problem at all, but at this point, I am willing to pay a little just to have the problem fixed.Fun fact? You can't contact their support staff about your product if it is out of warranty! Want to search for a new battery for the machine just to get an idea of how expensive replacing it will be? There's none listed! Now I have passed the point of angry. I am telling you, do not buy an HP unless you enjoy receiving no help when something goes awry. I am also telling this to all of my friends, and my husband is telling this to all of his coworkers-- don't buy HP.", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best money I've spent!", "Author": "Roland", "ReviewID": "R1YXRQ3CE0G1I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop by far exceeded my expectations! it is fast, sturdy, lightweight, and very nice looking.

Just last week I noticed a very small in the lower right portion of the screen, which troubled me because the laptop has seen very little movement and a lot of care since the hinge broke. Then the very next day I sit down in my desk chair and open the laptop to find that the crack in the lower portion of the screen has  taken over the entire LCD screen, with the crack going from corner to corner. The machine has barely even been off my desk for maybe a day or two every few months, and now that my warranty is up I'm forced to find a way to replace the screen myself. Not to mention the beats that came with it (which isn't really Hewlett-Packard's design) has broken as well. For what I considered a bargain at the time of purchase has turned into an expensive, poorly constructed piece of technology. Great aesthetics when it is good condition though, it's just keeping it in good condition that is the trouble.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad construction, worst customer service", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RJ7A9XOVH1LOI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this machine nearly a year ago. After first few months the left side of the screen split. It was still in warranty so i sent it back for repair (i should have insisted on a replacement). The screen split exactly the same way soon after i received it back, only by this time it was out of warranty. There is a problem with the hardware that other people with this model have faced too.
