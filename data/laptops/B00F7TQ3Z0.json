{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great value and excellent performing laptop.", "Author": "Ghenghis", "ReviewID": "R19PCZ9FZC8VCS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this locally for $400 after my Asus i5 laptop overheated and crashed leaving medesperately searching for a replacement, I got lucky.Here's what you get, a quad core APU with Radeon HD 8550G graphics, 4Gig Ram, 740G harddrive, and a DVD-R/W, plus a 17.3\" display in a lightweight and beautifully designedcarbon fiber look silver frame with Win8/64 pre-installed.My only con, this display could be better, the colors are a little washed out, no way to fix thisand there are only 3 resolutions, a 1600x900, a 1280x, and 1024. OK, I'm done venting, I didn'tpay for a premium piece of glass and if you're not looking at it next to your desktop display youmay not notice.Needs more RAM, 4Gig isn't enough as 768M are allocated to the video, and as yet I haven't foundhow to allocate more after I added another 4Gig stick. HP uses a captive screw on the backplateso you just unscrew it and slide the panel down and off. But to HP's credit, the Ram that is installedis DDR3 PC3-12800 * CL=11 * Unbuffered * NON-ECC * DDR3-1600 * 1.35V * Performance was greatlyenhanced with the addition of more Ram, the Windows Experience number jumped from 5.9 to 7.1, andyou can tell an obvious difference when you are navigating the web or running multiple programs.As a test of stability, I opened 6 video players all running 1Gig+ files and after 20 minutes theywere all still chugging along, I was shocked actually, this has been quite a surprise overall.Also, video editing is a breeze with this cpu, it just rips right through large files.The chicklet keyboard is workable, but the touchpad is laggy and you will want to add a mouse ASAP.However, after attaching to a separate monitor via HDMI I find that the colors and some of the controlsare all there. Problem is, I cant install a copy of Catalyst on this Win 8 thing to give me moreflexibility over colors and contrast. I guess I'll just have to be happy on my extended monitor...butagain, I'm limited to only 4 resolutions on a 1920x1200 monitor but I can live with that. The main harddrive is not partitioned so its a little clunky. I'm running 3 USB devices with no lag and they connectright up via an upstream to my Dell monitor. Also a Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse were plug and play.On the plus side, there is a Cyberlink Media Suite included that has PowerDVD and PowerDirector10among other features. I would like this laptop better if it had Win 7, but because of all theBios tweaks there is no way to go in reverse unless you buy a machine with Windows Pro, then Microsoftgives you \"downgrade\" rights, which is funny because Win 8 is a clear step in the wrong directionand a BIG FU to consumers.BTW, if you're freaking out over Windows 8, thats OK, go right ahead. Windows 7 was the best thingMicrosoft ever did, and Win 8 is just the most ridiculous hodgepodge of a software geek's wet dreamI could have ever imagined. However, 2 days after buying this laptop I have discovered a world ofworkarounds and tweaks, such that I am about 70% back to the look and feel of Win 7, so there ishelp out there, and most of the fixes are free. \"Start8\" was a good investment though that gives youback your Start menu and kills the insanely stupid Windows 8 App screen and all its intrusive popups.A final note, what finally made me fall in love with this model was the surprise DVD encoding time usingConvertX/DVD 5.0. On my previous i5 (2.3Mhz) with 6Gig Ram, whenever I would encode DVDs there was a problemwith overheating, maxed out CPU usage, and maxed out Ram....then POW, my laptop would shut down. Alsoto encode 2.5-3G worth of video typically took 1 1/2 - 2 hours. On my first run today, this machine rippedthrough 2 video files totaling 2.8G in 30 minutes! WHAT??? Thirty minutes at 100+fps, with no overheatsand even though the CPU was pegged at 98%, the system was still usable, it would lock up on that i5 machine.For an APU this laptop is a beast! 4.5 Stars, I'm very happy.My apologies in advance for anyone with questions, apparently in Amazon's great wisdom I have been bannedfrom posting comments for life. But this machine has 2 memory slots, and one 4G stick installed. Did I mentionI HATE Windows 8?", "Date": "September 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unbelievable Value!", "Author": "Computer Expert", "ReviewID": "R2WGF3SAZQU1U7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this computer on clearance from Best Buy at $460 a month ago and I can only say that it is incredible value for the money. It comes with windows 8, but can be downgraded to windows 7. The display is huge and beautiful, I'm not sure what the other reviewer is talking about! The audio and video cards are very strong and the processor is one of the strongest AMD processors around. I would recommend this laptop to anybody who is looking for an all-around workstation that can also double as an entertainment center. What really makes it amazing is the price, though! A++++++++++", "Date": "September 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good for the price. Just add ram.", "Author": "leroy sekaquaptewa", "ReviewID": "RYHLQBF8KFMI9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The laptop comes with 4 gigs of ram but i had an extra 2 gig stick sitting around and that helps it play games a lot better. I was getting somewhere around 10 to 15 Fps in battlefield 3 without the extra 2 gigs then around 20 to 25 with it. I only used Battlefield 3 as a benchmark to see what the upper limit would be for gaming. What i mostly do on this laptop is Photoshop, Google Sketchup and Blender. It handles those programs very well. When i need a break from productivity it can do CS source, torchlight, Dawn of War: soulstorm. Its gaming strengths lean more toward RTS than FPS. If you are looking for an all around machine that will do light gaming (GET EXTRA RAM IF YOU ARE GOING TO PLAY A GAME) for at or under 500 bucks this will do it. My only real gripe is the body feels a bit flimsy but you sacrifice ruggedness for a sleek look. This is my first windows 8 machine so i had to do some searches to get rid of the hp bloatware but once that was cleaned up i felt better knowing it had only what i wanted on it. This laptop is a good companion piece for a power user but not a desktop replacement. Better than a chrome book but not quite an alienware.", "Date": "February 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great laptop for the price!", "Author": "John M", "ReviewID": "R1ADL4CACLELG9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this laptop over black Friday weekend BB had a great deal on it and i picked up an open box unit for $270 which is a steal. First impressions of this laptop are its a great deal for the money.The plus sides of this laptop have to be CPU and screen size are overall very good  the screen to be  of decent quality for the price. It of course is not as nice as my high end PC monitor but for the price I cant complain. The other thing I was happy about is the overall lack of bloatware that was on the laptop. While i do wish that HP and others would do clean OS install i know its a pipe dream but compared to others i found this laptop to be less loaded than most. The other thing that I like that HP did was to allow great access to components via 1 screw. The hard drive, memory and wireless card are easy to get to, you could easily add a better wireless card to the laptop to support wireless AC or dual band. I also like the keyboard for the price a huge step up from my few year old gateway.The main downside of this laptop for me was the hard drive i found it to be terribly slow, however i do have SSD drives in all my other PCs so that does play a factor. The other thing that bothered me was the way the memory was installed only having 1 4gb module means that the memory can not run in dual channel which hurts performance great, especially for graphics performance.  I also am not a huge fan of Windows 8 however once you spend a little time with it I don't find it to be all that bad.The only real issue I had so far was with connectivity when i first booted up the laptop the connection seemed to drop constantly a driver update seemed to clear it up from windows update. This was quite annoying at first though. I am using WPA2 PSK wireless N as a reference for anyone else with issues.Since getting the laptop i did swap the drive for a 60g SSD as i do not need the storage it has made a huge difference in load times. I also did a fresh install of windows 8 using a disk i had from another PC which removed any software i did not need. One thing to note the key for windows is stored in the bios so using a Win8 image/disk is an easy install.Overall i find this is a great laptop for the price.", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "HP gets an A plus on this one", "Author": "jerome", "ReviewID": "R1PNQRJBDP15SA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all I'll say when it comes to computers I'm pretty demanding but because I live in the real world funds are an issue so I usually do my best to get the best for my dollar.With that said when I came across this laptop and compared its specs to its price ($399.99) I liked it right away but I never expected it to be as powerful as it is.This is basically what I was looking to do with it3d modelingPhotoshopCodingAnd Netflix  (of course)Now I knew based on its specs it could handle Photoshop coding and Netflix as far as 3d modeling I figured it can handle some basic tasks but did not expect it to be able to handle some of the more advanced functions Of programs like Blender and 3ds max but surprisingly it did much better than I thought it could.Even more surprising this lap top handles games that I thought it would never be able. now I'm not claiming this is some high end gaming rig but it can handle some pretty demanding games like Arkham City and Crysis 2 without scaling back the graphics too much and running at the native screen resolutionThere are some cons, I think the power cord is a bit short and while the the body of the laptop has a nice design it is a little loose and the screen has a bit to much flex when you open it.I have to say I've been an AMD fan for a very long time but I seriously underestimated the power off the APU series chips. once again AMD has put great performance at a great price point and HP has put together a great package with this laptop!This is definitely worth its price in fact I think this machine could sell for an additional $100 and be still be fairly priced.", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent laptop!!", "Author": "J. Freed", "ReviewID": "ROER9NALK9F6Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love almost everything about this laptop, the only thing bothering me at the moment are the touchpad drivers. Everything worked fine when it had Windows 8 installed, but after upgrading to Windows 8.1 two finger tap no longer worked. Obviously this is only a driver issue and I expect it will be fixed in the near future, but it's worth noting.Other than that the laptop is very fast, has a huge hard drive, has a very responsive touchpad, and has a great feeling keyboard. To anyone wondering, the touchpad has a kind of rough texture to it that personally I really like. The keys on the keyboard have a fairly short travel and are quite comfortable to use.Note: The description says this laptop has a backlit keyboard, that is NOT true! This laptop DOES NOT have a backlit keyboard", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "I like this computer...especially for the price.", "Author": "Big Sur Steve", "ReviewID": "RAJQPXGAQJ9SS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using the Pavilion for about 3 weeks, and am still impressed with value HP has put into this product.  A 750 GB hard drive, a quadcore processor, a built in optic drive, a 17.3 inch screen that is bright and has rich color, wrapped in an attractive case that doesn't look or feel cheap at all.  I paid $400 for mine and feel it's best deal I have ever made in a computer purchase.  If Apple had their name on this machine, you would be looking at a price north of $2000.When I ordered the Pavilion, I was looking for a replacement for my 7 year old Dell desktop running Windows XP.  The Dell still worked, but barely.  It had become amazingly slow and was beyond anti-virus software or hard disc defrags to solve it's lethargic pace.  While the price of the Pavilion was attractive, I was apprehensive when I ordered it.  I was expecting something cheap looking and feeling.  I wasn't expecting much for $400.After unpacking the Pavilion, I was pleasantly surprised to find an attractively designed silver case with a subtle small dot pattern.  When the case was opened, I found a carbon fiber looking, gloss black deck with large keyboard and number pad. A textured touchpad with right and left click buttons is centered below the letter keys, and is offset to the left of the number pad.  An elongate black screen occupies most of the upper portion of the deck above the keyboard with an on off button positioned to it's left.  The display screen has a gloss black bezel with silver colored hinges and a small HP logo.  The overall design is elegantly simple.Set-up was a breeze.  Put the battery in, turn the computer on, and follow the set-up instructions.  After setting up the computer preferences and passwords, I replaced Windows 8 with Windows 8.1,  Windows 8.1 isn't all that difficult to learn and I found myself able to navigate through the basics of the operating system within a day.  During my first day of use, I found the Pavilion a better computer than I had expected, with a screen that was much brighter and clearer than the 20\" monitor it had replaced.  Actually I prefer the brightness and color of the bargain basement Pavilion to the screen on my much more expensive MacBook Air. The Air has a 13 inch screen which seems a bit dull compared to the screen on the Pavilion.Pros:1. Outstanding quality and performance for price2. Large keyboard and number pad3. Bright, clear screen with good quality color4. 750 GB Hard Drive5. Fast, Quad Core Processor6. Optic disc driveCons:1. Some keyboard symbols are hard to read2. Black deck surrounding keyboard leaves finger printsI really have no big complaints about the Pavilion.  If you are looking for a large screen portable or desktop computer, check out the Pavilion.  You will be surprised at how much computer you can get for the price.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great laptop.", "Author": "Sammuel", "ReviewID": "R1W0QAR2NYQDB2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm using this laptop for work right now.

After I received it in the mail and have used it for a couple days, I am happy with my purchase. The screen is very huge! It is just something to get use to. The keyboard is not a lit-back keyboard, but that is just a minor con. The speakers are decent. It is a lot louder than my old computer so I do approve. Also, the processor is good. The battery last long but when you are using it 24/7 like I am, it dies pretty quickly.If you are looking for a computer to use for your daily computer tasks, such as searching the internet, social networking, and/or school related things, this computer runs perfectly well; however, if you are looking for a computer for occasion gaming you would need to add another 4gb of ram (in which I did). I like to play computer games a lot, such as league of legends, Warcraft, and etc. It runs pretty fast, and the resolutions are good. Windows 8 is something to get used to, but its not that difficult to use. It takes some time to learn but if you do not want to keep windows 8, you can downgrade to windows 7.Overall, I am happy that I can use this computer for my school work and also my gaming.", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "the worst laptop I have had", "Author": "Isidro Mendoza", "ReviewID": "R1S5PRHZ47D0RD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "People, please don't get this Laptop.
