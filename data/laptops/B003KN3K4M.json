{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Decent computer, small drawbacks", "Author": "Living Life In The Midwest", "ReviewID": "R3GMIQBJOFEAZD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "!!UPDATED!!I have had my g42-230us for three months and found it to be a decent moderately powerful computer. The 7200RPM hard drive and 1Mb per core cache give it the extra \"umph\" it needs to compete with  the Intel offers.This computer, like most consumer targeted systems, came loaded with bloatware (software that isn't required and slows down performance).I am a computer tech so the first thing I recommend for this and all consumer targeted computers is to make the restore DVD's as soon as you turn on the computer and before you connect to a network or the internet. Second thing I recommend to do is to get a genuine copy of Windows 7, then use it to reformat (and delete all extra hard drive partitions) and reinstall operating system. Doing this is almost literally the difference between night and day. You will realize more hard drive space, faster boot and shutdown, no software \"nags\" (other than Windows 7 \"nags\") or bloatware pop ups to activate and upgrade trial software and no performance robbing unnecessary running services and registry entries.I tell my customers to consider this a required cost to any big brand consumer level computer purchased (comsumer level computers are typicaly  computers sold that are not installed with Windows 7 Professional). You can get windows here on Amazon:Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium Microsoft Windows 7 Professional . Keep in mind bloatware keeps the cost of the computer down (the computer's maker is often paid to install this trial software in hopes it will lead to the sale of the full product.After installing Genuine Windows 7 64bit I have a decent professional grade laptop for a few hundred less than what HP sells them for otherwise.Clarification from what other reviews have stated: All three USB ports are v2.0 and are powered to 500mA. I have tested them and confirmed this to be true even under battery power.Note:No modem is included and no PC Card socket is present.The speakers and Altec Lansing, upward facing above the Function keys near the display hinge.Wired LAN is not Gigabit Ethernet (this is a real downgrade from my almost four year old Acer Aspire).Annoyances:The power button is slightly recessed and very small. I have very small fingers but still have to press the button multiple times to get it depressed enough to activate (but now I just use my finger nail and it works fine).The hard drive activity light looks to be a 1mm LED mounted behind a hole in the left side of the unit next to the media card reader. This is excellent for the person sitting to my left when they want to know if my hard drive is active but totally useless to me.Also the power / charging light looks to be a 1mm LED mounted behind a hole on the right side near the DC input. This too is excellent for the person on my right that wants to know if my laptop is charging or on but totally useless to me.There is however a power light in the power button above the Function keys and speakers near the hindge but it to looks to be a 1mm LED pointed straight up and can't be seen when the lid is closed so you cannot see if your computer is on/sleeping/or off unless you open the lid or look at the led on the right side of the unit.Almost a deal killer is the fact that the touchpad area is not recessed or raised, nor does it have a different pattern or texture than the palm rests. Without looking, using the touchpad buttons as an guide, a person cannot feel where the touchpad area starts and ends on the left and right side. I used 3M blue painters tape 3M 2090 Scotch-Blue Painter's Tape for Multi-Surfaces 1-Inch x 60-Yard, 4-Rollto create outlines of the touchpad area to use the unit in the dark and without watching my fingers.Battery:The stock battery is a MU06 and the battery life is very good but I got the MU09 extended life batter anyway. The extended life battery does stick out some at the bottom causing a funny lop-sided look. Also an optional higher watt charger can be found but I don't know it would be any better than the one included.

The factory restore \"clean\" option still installs many services and registry items including HP \"nags\" and programs that connect to HP's web site to keep you informed up updates and messages (offers). The clean install I recomend will give a user the most out of the computer.!!!!!!CAVEAT!!!!!!!: Some users do not mind or miss the lost performance and hard drive space and can very well live with the hp \"clean\" install or even the factory install.I only mention the clean install in my review because I and most of my cutomers are \"power\" users and prefere a true Windows clean install from a genuine Windows disc. Plus a person can buy almost the same computer without the bloatware software installed for twice the price. I am just pointing out an alternative to spending twice the money and getting the almost the same computer as a pro model.", "Date": "September 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great computer, given the price is right", "Author": "J. Shariat", "ReviewID": "R1101A1NYPEAOM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this computer from another site when they had a promotion on it. I looked at the specs and the price, and saw that it was a steal, and I abandoned my prejudice against HP for their past products and bought it. I am very happy that I did. I won't say the exact price that I got the computer for, but I will say that this computer is in the $600 and under category.This computer is a good mixture of good technology. The processor in this computer is a very good processor for a number of reasons. The L2 cache is 2mb as opposed to 1mb in most Turion IIs; the energy consumption is 25w, which is very low for a laptop processor of this magnitude. The M880 chipset and ATI Radeon 4250 provide a decent graphics setup; obviously, this computer isn't for modern gaming due to the lack of a dedicated video card... However, this video setup is much better than you will get with any Intel onboard graphics and will work just fine for most anything short of intensive 3D gaming/ 3D rendering... The 14\" screen on this computer is a good one, with great viewing angles. The speakers are good for laptop speakers, but really, there aren't any spectacular internal laptop speakers and so if you want great sound quality and volume, invest in a decent pair of laptop speakers.  The HDMI port is wonderful...  can't forget to mention that! HDMI is a nice feature to have on a laptop of this type!Aesthetically, this computer is certainly pleasing. The silver-ish patterned case of the computer is really unique and I really enjoy it. 14\" is the perfect size for me, as it cradles perfectly in my lap and is much, much more portable than 15.6\" or so laptops than I have owned in the past.The keyboard is not bad at all... No Num Pad, but the buttons and function button planning are very well done. For a 14\" laptop, I'm not sure if you can ask for a smarter/ better keyboard than this...As for the cons, there is one that may just be something I am misunderstanding, but it really seems like the USB port that is on the right side (for the mouse) is not USB 2.0... For some reason, it doesn't get nearly the transfer rate as the other USB ports. I recommend getting a high speed hub with this computer so that you can easily add the additional USB ports that you will surely need. The other con is also fair in magnitude... HP has a lot of programs that it installs to keep your computer running well with HP updates on the drivers on your computer and such. Some of these programs are helpful and some are bloatware. It is much harder to sort out which is which with HP laptops than other brands, since they get so much more involved in the upkeep of your computer. I have it set up just fine on my computer now, and practically any laptop that you get nowadays is going to have some kind of bloatware on it, so the problem is easily handled with a bit of time, just like with most laptops. Extra care is needed to make sure that you do not remove programs that HP has created to help your computer, such as keep the hardware drivers up to date, etc...All in all, this computer is great... Just what I was looking for! This laptop is perfect for just about anyone that doesn't do intense 3D graphic stuff. I would even go so far as to say that anything better than this is overkill if you are not going to be doing that type of stuff. This is a great desktop replacement computer that is very versatile in its uses and very good on the battery given the power of the computer. I was hesitant to buy HP before this computer, but I am certainly not anymore.Five stars from me!Edit-Windows Experience Index: (out of 7.9)Processor - 5.8Memory - 5.9Graphics (Aero) - 4.2Graphics (Gaming) - 5.3Hard Disk speed - 5.9This shows that this is a well rounded computer, just a step below cutting edge in every category (and still pretty cutting edge in most categories).  4.2 for Windows Aero experience is a typical score for GPUs of this type.This ranking also doesn't rank on things like battery conservation, which this computer is great at.  I hope this info helps someone interested in this computer!", "Date": "August 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Meets my needs well", "Author": "Peter D.

It has a 14 screen that is perfect for your everyday typing, if you want to watch a DVD at a coffee shop, or if you're like me, the occasionally youtube video. So far, I have no complaints about this laptop.Like the previous reviewer, I was surprisingly happy at the weight of this laptop. At 4.85 lbs, I feel like I can carry it with me everywhere. I even looked at some 13.3 inch Toshiba and Lenovo laptops, but theirs' measured at around 4.75 or 4.8 lbs with a bigger price tag.Pros of this amazing laptop:-lightweight-long battery life-very good quality camera-a senor mousepad that allows you to turn it off or on with just one finger-user friendly installation-rank #1 in Newsweek's green ranking (it uses less energy than your average 14-in laptop)-sturdy feel (good material)-brought it when amazon had a fantastic price of only $550 with free shippingIf you're looking for a stylist laptop with the performance specs to back it up...this is the laptop for you!", "Date": "August 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Could be A LOT better", "Author": "Not great", "ReviewID": "R29CIRHVGSV1VG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have had this computer for about 4 months, and it is not what I thought it would be...its worse. I bought it because it was a steal and i was on a budget. The battery life is about 1 1/2 hourse, which is not very good when you use it during a 2 hour class! I hate the mouse pad because it gets dirty very easily because of the crevices (the whole computer is acutually that way) The bottom gets SUPER, SUPER hot. I have acutually had red marks on my legs when I have let it sit to long on my lap, because it was so hot. I am currently saving my money to buy a macbook. If you can afford the extra couple hundred dollars, I would definately go for a little better laptop.

My first concern was the HP lacks a graphics card with dedicated 512MB video ram like the ASUS did. Other than playing graphics-intensive video games, my worry was for nought. My second was the AMD Turion II CPU, wondering if it was a step-up to an Intel Core 2 Duo Mobile T5800/2.0Ghz - it was. My third was the delta numbers using Windows 7 performance meter:HPG42/ ASUSCPU 5.8/ 5.14GB RAM 5.9/ 5.IAERO 3.3/ 3.4GAMES 4.5/ 5.3HD 5.9/ 5.7I suggest to anyone buying this unit to create HP Recovery DVD as soon as possible. I decided to upgrade the HD to a bigger capacity drive so I replaced the onboard 350GB/7200rpm drive with a 500GB/7200rpm and used the Recovery DVD to restore the unit to its \"newly purchased\" condition. The entire process was flawless. All the ports and optical media drive are on the left and right side, none at the back. If there is a\"fat\" USB inserted next to the drive the drive-tray will bump into the USB drive. Ditto if using an external mouse. The Synapse mouse pointer is very sensitive and a wrist resting next to it interferes with its operation. There are only 3 built-in USB ports but with a $7 USB port multiplexer that became a non-issue. The \"aluminized\" skin is textured and oily finger-prints do not show. At less than $525,I am very pleased with it.

I am very picky about laptops and I give this one ALL 5's in all of these areas below:1) BATTERY LIFE - This one is rated at 4.5 hours (no computer will achieve the battery life the manufacturer states). However, when I use a computer I have WiFi ON all the time and I am always on the internet. So I tested out this unit and with WiFi on ALL the time with 4 tabs opened, I had a battery life of 3.5 hours! I was so pleased. I believe if I turned my screen down to 25% and just typed in Word, kept the WiFi off, I would have had 4.0 to 4.25 hours! So I give it 5 stars. (My Acer Aspire (old) netbook only gets 4.5 to 5.0 hours, and my old 15.6 Acer (with Vista) only got 1 - 1.5 hours of battery life.2) COOLNESS: I have owned several laptops in the past and they ran so hot that I could have fried an egg on them. This one is 95% cool and now with my Thermapak Cooler, it is 100% COOL even with I run it for 12 hours at one time!3) QUIET - Cannot hear the HARD DRIVE and the fan is so quiet.4) Hard Drive does not spin much.5) Fast, fast and fast computer: Booting is in just a couple of seconds. Opening programs is very fast.6) Love the keyboard, so easy to type on this!7) Lightweight and small but not too small. Fits easily into my laptop backpack!8) The 14\" is best for me and better than a net-book for travel because the screen is so much larger and this laptop has a DVD/CD read/write drive. I watched a movie on it and it was plenty large enough for me with beautiful picture and colors!I love HP and have used Dell and Acer, however, I prefer HP to the other brands!In summary: In my opinion, this is the best laptop for the money out there!", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "So Far, So Good", "Author": "Scott James \"Scott James\"", "ReviewID": "R2HY5R6GE0UDMZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just brought mine home today.
