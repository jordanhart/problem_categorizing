Partially because of defective out of box and partially because of all the run around by Sony to find a solution to fix the problem.You would think that after all of these years both Sony and Microsoft would have learned the meaning of user friendly. Spending days to get this laptop set up and finding my way through all of VAIO and Windows 8  and then run into this problem is Frustrating.The problem is with Creating Restore Media. After updating, thats the very first step in setting up the PC. Included in the box is asmall pamphlet with the barest of instructions on how to create the Restoration Media. How much more paper would it take to print and include in the pamphlet?You first have to push buttons to find the page with the instructions on how to create the disks.Then go step by step through the instructions to actually get to where you can create disks. Actually had to use the old fashioned method and write them down so I could follow them.The failure is Error Code 0xC0AA0301 that appeared on disk 3 of 5. Instructs to restart the PC.Restart the PC and start all over again. After creating disk 1 and 2 you would be able to start at disk 3 of 5. Nope.Start all over again on Disk 1.  I just wasted 3 DVD R disks.This time on try number two the same Error Code happened on Disk 1 of 5.  Now 4 DVD R disks in the round file.My first step to fix the problem was I goggled the Error Code. Thats really no help. Either have to download 3rd party software, go to sites I do not trust or go to Sony Support.Second step was Sony Forum. Searched for The Error Code. Found questions and answers,  all referring to Win 7 and nothing specific for Win 8 or my model Laptop. I learned long ago that posting a question on any forum results in somebody spam answering, no answer and nothing that really applies to the specific problem. This Error has been happening for atleast two years.Third step was to call the Sony 888 number specific for laptops. First call was answered by somebody with their headset laying on their desk. I could hear room noise and clattering and people talking in background. Hung up and called right back. Now the support number is down for maintenance.  No more tries by me.Forth step. Went to Sony Support website and went directly to my Laptop model page. Of all of the items listed on this page, The Error code is not listed there. Then searched the page and could not find the Error Code.Fifth step. Returned to Amazon and thanks to their Return Policy I amgetting a replacement.The One Star rating is no reflection on Amazon's service or handling of this laptop.I give Amazon.com a FIVE STAR RATING", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Do not buy this laptop if you use the internet", "Author": "Gin Meniscus", "ReviewID": "R3RGCCH4NPZI3Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If it is 1994, and you want to play Doom from your disc drive then maybe this computer is great. I mean the touchscreen, while flighty, is still pretty cool. But if you live in the present and use THE INTERNET, then you probably don't want this computer. For some reason, Sony decided that wifi adapters aren't all that important:[...]I tried to contact their customer support about this issue...and they sent me back to that page. Sony knows about this issue, but is still selling this laptop, and their customer service is run by a Kafka character.
