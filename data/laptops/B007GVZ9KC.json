{"Reviews": [{"Title": "great!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "ROUH1YVOPCBL6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After much research online (and consulting my bank account), I settled on this laptop. I was looking for an affordable ultrabook, for normal use i.e. check mail, some document work, play music in the background, watch the occasional movie on Netflix. This is perfect!I also downloaded Windows 8 for $15 using the deal available until Jan 2013, and I'm really enjoying it now. The boot up is literally 3 seconds, and the restart is about 20 seconds (probably less tbh). My only con is I wished it had a back-lit keyboard, but I'm already over that hiccup.Besides that, everyone is raving about how lovely and thin and light it is. The keys are quite comfortable to press, there is no crazy fan noise, and it doesn't get very hot with moderate use. Please note, this laptop came with with a case that looks nothing like a laptop case so you would appear to be carrying notes in a nice folder rather than a laptop. Battery life is about 4 hours with my normal usage, which is WiFi, Chrome, a couple apps, maybe some music in the background. The sound is excellent. Overall: very pleased.", "Date": "November 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lots of Reason to Like it, but Keyboard is Really Bad", "Author": "RobD3", "ReviewID": "R32UY6G2GS7RFB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Pros:FastLooks greatGood battery lifeSeems well madeGreat sound system for such a compact computerHaven't noticed any fan noiseNever gets very hotNot too much bloatwareBUT...Cons:Keyboard is the worst I've ever experienced. About 5% of my keystrokes do not register. If you are a fast typer and used to just touching the keys, I think you would be very frustrated with this keyboard. If you look at reviews of other model zenbooks, you'll see this is a common complaint.The track pad is pretty bad too.I definitely would not buy this computer again because of the keyboard issue, but it wasn't so bad that I returned it.", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing and FAST Laptop", "Author": "Chad", "ReviewID": "R13IY62NL8Z65X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is the best ultrabook HANDS DOWN. I am a PC Technician and this laptop just blows its competition out of the water for this price. Many people complained about the touchpad on this laptop, but mine worked PERFECT. The size and instant turn on from standby(when you open the lid), is insanely fast. With Restart Timer, it ran a 32 second boot up. AMAZING fast! Get this laptop!EDIT* - The Price of the laptop was $760 when I bought it, now it is $950+. I recommend a 3rd Generation Intel i5/i7(this laptop is a 2nd generation) if you are going to pay this much money for an ultrabook. Also check out Staples/Office Depot pricing, they have incredible sales, sometimes Costco too. The laptop is still great! Only thing is the keys, for people who type fast this keyboard isn't very good because the keys are so slim, and it doesn't pick up your keystrokes very easy.

It's light, has good battery life, and the screen is bright and clear. Two minor nits: I'm not a fan of the chiclet keys but I see why they are used in this configuration, and the embedded L/R click buttons are not what I would have designed in. Why can't they be just slightly raised? The ASUS-ware is moderately annoying but I'm sure can be cleared out; the Bluetooth works well.", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it BUT......", "Author": "Carolyn Boroden", "ReviewID": "R34QT4QFMSOOQM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really love everything about this machine except the keyboard.  Maybe I will get used to it, but when I type I find that if you don't press the keys hard eough  (enough) it just happened, then you always have to go back and correct what you are typing.  It happens a lot with the N key.  It is the only thing that annoys me about this machine.  Everything else is awesome.  The look, the speed, the presentation, the light weight, the 1600x900 resolution etc.  So if you are not going to type a lot on it, the machine is great.  If you are writing a book.....you may want a better keyboard!!", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "A very good wanna-be macbook air", "Author": "Phil", "ReviewID": "R2E8D7H76RQGM2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this basically looking for a more powerful version of a netbook with styling comparable to a macbook air. I do basic browsing, netflix, etc. but have no patience for slow or choppy response.So far it has been very good. When I open it from sleep it is ready to go almost instantly. I would say overall the keyboard and touchpad are slightly less quality than say a macbook air. However, having paid ~$200 less than an air, I would say I got exactly what I paid for. It is still ridiculously light and thin, the polished aluminum is cool (literally and figuratively), and the display resolution is among the best available. You can certainly appreciate HD content.The biggest weakness I've found so far is the keyboard, but it's a fairly inconsequential weakness, at least to me. There's no home/end/pg up/pg down buttons and the keys just aren't as satisfying as a mac. Also, the 128 GB SSD is very fast, but out of the box I had 85 GB of free space, so definitely account for that.Overall: Very happy. It is 80% of the cost of a macbook air with maybe 80-85% of the perceived quality and 90% of the capability.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lightweight beauty, that is tough and good on battery life", "Author": "Patricia A McLelland", "ReviewID": "R2F5N71E1O6G1W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had my Zenbook for 15 mos. When it was only a few months old, it knocked it off a high table onto a concrete patio. After a moment of terror, I found that the only damage was a scratch on the beautiful polished aluminum case and small dent at one corner. I expected a \"black screen of death\" -- but not a hiccup. The solid state harddrive continued to do its job and the monitor was fine.I use this notebook every day, and not so gently. After over a year of use, I'm still impressed. I've owned a dozen notebooks and this is a well built unit. Quality of the case and hinge is superb. No cracks, squeaks or other problems with the cover hinge, like I had with my old Sony Vaio. Still boots up very fast and battery life far exceeds my other notebook, a Samsung 9.  Brightness is good but the Samsung 9 has the lock on the definition of \"bright white screen.\" Side by side, the Samsung has a superior video display. However, due to the poor battery life, I only use the Samsung when plugged in. Backlit keyboard on Asus is much better than the Samsung.I upgraded the drivers and my track pad works pretty well. I agree with other reviewers that the keyboard is very jumpy. The cursor repositioned itself three, make that four, times while I was typing this so you have to be careful with finger position and keystrokes. Really annoying. Overall, this is a solid, beautiful, lightweight and powerful machine. I have the 128 GB SDD, and wish I had the 256GB. This notebook has become my workhorse. I have had no technical or hardware problems, other than what was mentioned above. HD and motherboard solid, so far. And the battery life... that's a big deal. I'm still getting 5 hours solid hours.I am giving four stars due to the keyboard flakiness. Other than that, I'm very pleased.", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Asus not that great", "Author": "Brooke Christensen", "ReviewID": "R12UAZTIEGL9XD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i bought this computer five months ago. everything seemed to work fine. however the screen went white. because I bought it online and it was an older model asus will not honor the year warranty it came with. buyer beware asus will not accept any form of purchase proof to honor their warranty.", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "fast shipping", "Author": "sehzade can", "ReviewID": "R2S5CA2NW6HFKP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "fast shipping, good quality of costumer support, but keyboard of the product is not as smooth as expected, I had to return product.", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "slick!", "Author": "Peter", "ReviewID": "R2JJCP82COEQMQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A great little laptop, quick slick and light.
