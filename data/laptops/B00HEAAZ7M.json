Amazon was wonderful with replacing my initial one that had a screen issue when I received it.  The screen started flickering immediately upon starting it up.  I've heard this is a frequent issue with HP.  My replacement laptop arrived and this one has an issue as well!  The keyboard is terrible and I have no idea why.  I'm not a super fast typer, but am also not super slow ... and so many of the letters I type just don't show up on the screen.  Sometimes I have to hit the key 3 times before it shows up.  I've even tried using a separate keyboard and had the same issue.  I'm not super techy and have no clue why this would be happening, but it is infuriating and I'm returning AGAIN.  I'm going to have to go with something different because two product issues is just CRAZY.", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "GREAT LAPTOP", "Author": "George F.

Price is great for a 17\" touchscreen. A little heavy but that's a small tradeoff for the huge screen and fast processor. Really like this product and it is really fast compared to my old clunker!I also bought a second power supply so I don't have to carry that from my home to my office every day. Although not full HD (but very close) the screen has amazing resolution, especially when viewing an HD video and it is almost impossible to discern any difference between it and 1080P. The sound is OK but certainly not exceptional, although it sounds much better through external speakers.Great laptop for the price. Don't buy a comparable brand that has a much lower screen resolution.", "Date": "April 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "It is a good computer", "Author": "Jordan", "ReviewID": "R3MDEWS3NPWUBP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We enjoy this computer because it is kind of our entertainment center.

I was going to return this laptop for a refund, my son convinced me to work with it and try to learn windows 8.  Well I am doing better, but what I love about this laptop is the size I don't have to strain my eyes to see what I'm doing.  I love the touch screen.  I don't recommend windows 8 without a touch screen.  The graphics are clear and you can change the font size to make it larger.  I am not a tech person, but I think windows 8 is not a good idea.  I don't know what you call it but the button you click to move the pointer is very loud, almost annoying. That is why I only gave 4 stars.  I did not purchase the warranty plan.  I hope I won't have any problems with this laptop.  Overall I am happy with my purchase.  My other choice for a 17 inch was the apple.  They don't make them anymore, so I would have to buy a refurbished one.  I was not willing to spend 1,300 for a used laptop.  If you purchase the HP I think you will be happy with it.", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great laptop!", "Author": "Harriet F.

I went from a desktop windows xp to this and I am getting around great on the most part.  each  day I learn new tricks on how to do things I didn't know.  So many built in features and love the touchscreen--best of both worlds having the built in mouse and touchscreen!  Great deal for the money!!!! I have to admit that sometimes when I am typing the font sizes changes and makes it bigger so I have to readjust but that is minor. It's a learning experience using touchscreen to copy and paste but as I mentioned I am learning the new way.
