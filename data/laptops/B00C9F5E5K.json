I have had NO problems whatsoever with this laptop. Had it over 6 months, and it still works like a charm.  This isn't a top of the line laptop, so I didn't expect dynamic performance. It is what it is.  Nice, basic laptop, decent speed, decent overall performance.  You want a blazing fast computer with all of the bells and whistles, $300-400 is the wrong price range to be looking at.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great computer, horrible touchpad", "Author": "NiuHuskieFan", "ReviewID": "R1P51VF4466X7V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a pretty good laptop.  It runs cooler than any laptop I've owned and the battery life is decent.  The only thing I can't stand is the touch pad.  The texture is awful, responsiveness is awful, it's too easy to brush while typing, and just totally unpredictable.  I use a wireless mouse and wish I could disable the touch pad altogether.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "when you updte ur ram to 8GB.

A month later, it started acting up and sometimes it just freezes or it stays 'thinking' or 'loading' when you turn it on. We end up taking the battery out and putting it back in so it starts working. And the cd/dvd player stopped working and I'm sure it was because of how the company handled it when we sent it for them to 'repair' it!!! It still doesn't have a year with us, and this happened after just 3 months of buying it! Don't waste money on any computer by Lenovo, their service and support sucks!", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your time", "Author": "Rosho", "ReviewID": "R335BEEPU5MOFS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've had nothing but issues with this. Even when it WAS working, it was a subpar computer that can't handle Windows 8 very well.After 2 months of casually using it for work, it wouldn't load the operating system. The computer is nothing more than a paperweight and Lenovo support is worthless.", "Date": "September 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worst Purchase I ever made!!! Don't buy this!!.", "Author": "Jean s Mueller", "ReviewID": "R9CIDU6SELPMR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Unfortunately I didn't just purchase one if these, I got two, one for me and one for my daughter. Both of us hate this computer equally. I thought it would be a cheap way to get introduced to Windows 8. The most annoying thing about it is when you're trying to type e-mails etc, it jumps all over the place and suddenly you're typing in the middle of a line you already finished, so you have to delete it from the wrong line and reenter it in the correct place. Windows 8 was definitely made for touch screen which this computer definitely is not. Save yourself the money and annoyance and stay away from this product", "Date": "July 20, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00C9F5E5K"}}
