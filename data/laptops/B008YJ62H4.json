{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Worst laptop yet", "Author": "jjg4 \"johnjg4\"", "ReviewID": "RVWUP29DKR3KW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is my fourth laptop.  I originally used it just as a backup in my office.  When my Toshiba died, I began using it regularly.  The keyboard feels cheap, the touchpad making a clicking sound as you use it.  It seems to have a mind of its own, with the touchpad sensitivity the likely culprit.  It changes font size, opens other programs, etc. for no reason.  The connection with my router is much weaker at a distance than with my Toshiba.  I should note that it first failed when it was two months old.  The customer service was surprisingly good and helped me repair the problem in two hours.  However, when friends would extoll the virtues of Dell because its customer service was so good, I would note that it is even better when the computer is so well built that you don't need customer service.  I would never buy an ASUS again.", "Date": "June 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Asus 15.6\" Laptop - 4GB Memory - 320GB Hard Drive\nIntel\u00ae Pentium\u00ae B960 processor Features a 2MB L3 cache and 2.2GHz processor speed.\n15.6\" LCD high-definition widescreen display With 1366 x 768 resolution and antiglare technology showcases movies and games in stunning clarity.\nIntegrated 10/100/1000 Mbps Fast Ethernet LAN With RJ-45 connector for quick and easy wired Web connection.", "Name": "Asus X54C-BBK15 15.6\" Laptop - Intel\u00ae Pentium\u00ae B960 processor / 4GB DDR3 Memory / 320GB Hard Drive / Multiformat DVD\u00b1RW/CD-RW drive with double-layer support / Webcam / Windows 7 Home Premium Edition 64-bit / Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41x3KoeJadL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008YJ62H4"}}
