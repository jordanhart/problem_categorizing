{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very Nice Laptop!", "Author": "Renee McClennon \"book worm\"", "ReviewID": "R2F1CK4BNE22YU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have an old Gateway tablet that I love but with usage I burned out the light for the monitor.  I received this laptop last week on Friday and thus far I really like it.  I would like to upgrade to 8GB of RAM but not sure if it is upgradable.  The only thing I don't like thus far is the sound system.  Its a bit weak but overall great computer for the price and Windows 7 Home edition reminds me of Vista Home edition just with upgrades but I'm super happy to buy this product brand new with Windows 7 and not have to worry about the Windows 8 horror stories.  I'll post again after a month or so but I highly recommend this laptop for work, download, watching videos, everyday basic usage etc.Oh I forgot I love this 17inch monitor.  Not sure why anyone would want to do work on a tablet (killing the eyes) but the monitor is great and the laptop is surprisingly light.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Well Worth The Price", "Author": "Bert", "ReviewID": "R1902ITQBTPJSC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "excellent laptop with great software and very easy setup.

Bought it from a local desaler that has been in business forty years.  They have there own tech people.  I find this laptop to be very functional, true it was a bit of a challenge for me at XP so long.  I have had this laptop for two weeks now and use it extensively several hours a day.  I feel very comfortable  using it n ow after getting use to it.  It is three times faster than my desktop I had.  I would recommend this laptop toanyone needing a very good laptop.

I've had good experiences with Gateway before, and I was drawn to everything this one came with (most notably, Windows 7; I have a deep loathing for 8).I received my laptop on Jan 8th, and everything was running smoothly. Unfortunately, starting the second day, my computer started freezing during Windows updates. By the fourth day, it was freezing when trying to wake from sleep mode. Today (day six), my trackpad quit responding; I had to use an external mouse. Rebooting didn't work, and everything was marked enabled.That was just one too many issues for me in less than a week of owning. I know not many others have complained of issues, so it might have just been this one unit, but I'm not taking that chance. I'm a college student who largely takes online classes, and I need a reliable computer. I'm returning this one, and getting a Toshiba instead.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "I like it, but...", "Author": "whocares", "ReviewID": "RK70EN4CXJOJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This laptop, while aesthetically pleasing, has a couple of issues.  First, and most surprising, is NO BLUETOOTH!  What modern PC does not?The other issue is the OS.  M$ tells me it is pirated.  Whether or not this is true, I shouldn't need to waste my time resolving it.  Gateway insists it isn't, so who is right?The touch pad was disabled with the last M$ update.  My complaint with the touchpad is it is too easily touched while typing.  I find I have to make too many corrections.  So, for the moment, not having a touchpad isn't a big negative.The only other thing is the keyboard seems a little flexible.  I've noticed it flexing while I type.  It hasn't been a problem so far, though.It would have been a better offer with a larger HD.", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "I absolutely love this computer!", "Author": "Joey Morales", "ReviewID": "R1Y6ESUD46F8UM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This computer has plenty of speed, it's esthetically a beautiful machine!The size is just what I need and I so prefer windows 7 over windows 8And for the price! . .

I had my other NV for 4 years straight and no problems with it, but it was starting to overheat and slow the system.  But 4 years with one laptop is great, so I decided to stay with the same brand/model and also, I didn't want windows 8.  Also,  I immediately replaced the 6 gb ram with 8 gb -- Crucial 8GB Kit (4GBx2) DDR3 1600 MT/.  After a few minutes of unscrewing the back, it took less than two minutes to put the additional ram in it.  Having said that, I didn't have it long enough with 6 gb to determine a difference in speed, but having the additional 2 gb can only help when needed. Other than that, I have had no problems with and would recommend it.  Also, for those who have issues with the low sound volume, like me!  Just go to your speakers properties and click the (loudness equalization) and you should hear a noticeable increase in volume.", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "The Best", "Author": "susan king", "ReviewID": "R2VDO2O86HISI7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The best product i have ever purchsed online!!

Also, I am very disappointed with the audio. I've noticed that I cannot hear some audio in videos even when I have the sound turned all the way up. Another issue is when the numb lock in on the page up and page down buttons will not work.

It's of a beautiful candy apple red color and also colored once opened on the key board too. I was so happy to find this and with Windows 7 ( I can not stand windows 8!) You simply will adore this laptop so far so good and the craftsmanship is also top notch coming with a protective cotton black keyboard cover and white cotton pouch to hold the lab top after use. Needless to say I am very happy best laptop I've owed yet.", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good computer, especially for the price", "Author": "A. Rubin", "ReviewID": "R1EE6J5HDECSP5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using this computer for a few months now. I generally like it except for a few quirks. It's speed is good. The hard drive fast and adequately large to hold a lot of photos, etc, and the memory enough for some large photo manmipulations. The screen is great, although when watching a movie, one must be perpendicular to the screen to avoid light/dark variations, especially when black appears on the screen. The battery seems excellent, as it has lasted almost 4 hours a couple of times before requiring recharge. There are a few annoying quirks... one of which makes it difficult to reboot the computer as when installing updates, and that is the computer hangs on reboot when Restart is chosen from the Start menu. One must physically shut down the computer, then restart. The keyboard, while mostly responsive, has a few sensitive keys that do not register unless they are hit squarely in the middle of the key. Unfortunately, the Delete key is one of them, and that's a key I use a lot. It seems that I must hit the keys relatively hard to avoid character dropouts. Another drawback of the keyboard is that there are no dedicated Home, End, Page Up, nor Page Down keys. One must use a combination of the Function key and one of the arrow keys to achieve those functions. Again, those are keys I use a lot, but I'm slowly getting used to the new combinations. The special function keys present a nice suite of functions and are quite responsive. All in all, I like this computer and would recommend it especially if you are seeking a laptop with Windows 7, especially for a 17\" with a price of $550.", "Date": "February 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Full of strange glitches", "Author": "MK", "ReviewID": "R11O7X8516T47G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "What I find very frustrating about this computer is that it is very \"skittish\".  By this I mean that suddenly, for no reason that I can ascertain, it will skip from one area to another, particularly when I am trying to write e-mails.  For example, in just tryiing to write this, the cursor jumps from one place to another.  Web pages will dis.appear all at once for no apparent reason.These \"foibles\" are so irritating that had I to do it over again, I would not purchase this machine.", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good looking case and windows 7", "Author": "Jerry Freeman", "ReviewID": "RT0BQYE2MKWMV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great computer if you are looking for windows 7.

It's also heavy. Since its size is at the largest end of the laptop spectrum, you'll have to pay a bit more for a carry bag. Excellent display. Fast processor. However, the sound quality is THE PITS. Tinny, barely audible. Makes watching a movie, or even a YouTube video, very painful. Sound is fine when you listen on headphones, so maybe it's the speaker. I plug an external speaker into the headphone jack when watching a movie, and this takes care of the problem. It's a nuisance, though. On the whole, I like this laptop but I wish it had better speakers.", "Date": "May 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice but a PIA.", "Author": "James Crosby \"???\"", "ReviewID": "R3EK4M7K5B2UIH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I like the computer, it's a nice piece of equipment.
