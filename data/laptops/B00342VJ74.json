Davila \"juan23\"", "ReviewID": "R304A1NYUV4EA6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I searched around for a long time trying to find a good balanced notebook/laptop.  I chose this ASUS because of its look and features--it is a gift for my wife.  I wanted to give her something that would be up-to-date and provide her with rich features and elegant look...this K52F-A1 provides that!  Though I am the one that set it up after receiving it--I let her unpackage it and do all the basic setup--by updating the Windows 7 Update, she loves this laptop.  I could tell by the look in her face she was very pleased with the gift.  It has good clean crisp look, the screen has amazing clarity.  The keyboard is smooth, easy to use, with all the keys easy to touch.  Each key has the appropriate amount of space between each key.  My wife commented that it was very light weight, not the heavy laptop that it looks to be.  She loved that it is light.  After taking the laptop into my hands, I could see why she stated that...it is very light, though it looks heavier because of the sturdy construction.  Very sturdy and strong.  I like the matted look & feel of the palm rest and the touchpad.  This is a great product with rich features (Core i3, 4Gb DDR3, 320Gb HD, etc.) for the price! It doesn't have everything I want in a laptop, but for anyone needing top-of-the-line with a budget, it is an excellent choice.  Which is why I give it 5-stars.  I am very pleased I chose this and that Amazon.com provided great service; arrived on time, strong packaging, and just all great service.

It was a speedy machine that ran great, for a while. I eventually started having trouble with the WiFi card, but that issue was resolved by installing a fresh driver.I was perfectly satisfied with my K52F up until about three weeks ago. Around that time, I noticed a catch in the hinge area whenever I opened it up. Eventually, said hinge broke completely in half and the surrounding plastic fell away.A bit of research revealed that the problem of the breaking hinge is a case flaw that several people had suffered from. According to what I unearthed, the Asus warranty covered this due to it being the fault of the company. The Asus warranty required me to send my computer in (on my own dime) to have them evaluate whether or not the damage was caused by me. The fact that I'd attempted to superglue my computer back together made me apprehensive about doing this, so I got in touch with a local store and got a reasonable quote on fixing it. Unfortunately, while in the store's custody, the LCD screen quit working.Like I said, the laptop itself ran great; it's just incredibly upsetting that the machine broke after less than a year of use.", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "great computer, but...", "Author": "LL in SF \"Nah, I really live in a cabin in th...", "ReviewID": "R1LIOG3AYN9G3U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great little computer.

I only have it for a few weeks but so far I love it. The speed is good. It has an I3 core which is perfect for the none gamer but I think it will do if you play minimal games. I love the HDMI port plus the 3 USB ports.THE SPEAKER QUALITY IS POOR....VERY POOR. THEY R TOO LOW, that is the only thing I don't like. The battery life is about 2.5 hours, the construction is fairly good. I love the screen display..it is nice and bright. Also, not too much preloaded crap. The price of about $350 is a great buy. I recommend this for students and those who need a good everyday laptop. I watch Netflix and the picture quality is very good..just the sound quality is poor because of the speaker. It is a great buy..  good speed, storage and quality.Jen.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great computer for the price", "Author": "J.

I had never heard of Asus before but the sales representative said they were great.I couldn't be happier with my Asus. It's fast and I have yet to have a problem after using it for over a year. I run multiple programs at once without any slow down. With 4gb of RAM it runs really fast.As one other person mentioned the volume is pretty low. That is the one flaw I have found on this computer.The other thing that took getting used to is the click mouse. It is not separated like other laptops I have had. Basically you have to click all the way to the left or right for it to register. It took some getting used to, but know I don't have a problem.Overall a great brand and a great computer.", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excelent pc, keyboard issues...", "Author": "Hugo Favio Gonzalez Lopez", "ReviewID": "R3NPC649HKIH60", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this computer just one day, and the performance is perfect for the money you pay, good so far.

I am SOOO glad I did. I was a little worried about getting a laptop that runs it's video processer through it's CPU, but after loading a few of my games, I found that this laptop is really pretty good! As others have mentioned, the sound is really low based on where Asus put the built in speakers. But I have found that the sound quality improves GREATLY when you plug in headphones or some other speaker device.It does tend to get a little warm when running a load for a period of time, but it is nothing to be really worried about.Another nice thing I noticed is that Asus has a website devoted to parts for their products, and the K52f is no exception. If you got the model with the DVD drive and later you realize you want the Blue Ray burner, you can buy it off their website. You can also buy another battery, power cord, recovery disk, and even the little rubber feet on the bottom of the laptop. I do not know of other companies that keep that stuff for sale even after the product is out of most main line stores.My only complaint is the company itself. I wanted to upgrade the CPU to the I5-540M. Some companies will solder on the CPU's onto the motherboard. I wrote Asus an e-mail asking them if they did that to this series of laptops. After 4 days with no reply, I called the Asus tech support to ask them. I was told that yes, the CPU is soldered onto the motherboard. Later that day, I got a response to my original e-mail, and in the e-mail I was told that no, the CPU is NOT soldered on. After doing a TON of research (the answer to this question is not easy to discover) I found out that the CPU is indeed not soldered onto the motherboard.All in all, I would give this laptop an 8 out of 10.", "Date": "March 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good sound quality", "Author": "Steve K", "ReviewID": "R333RS2V40G23", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I hesitate to give a rating of this unit as I've only owned one other laptop, an H/P Presario which lasted 3 years. I've owned my ASUS since October 2010 and it has performed without a hitch, though at the time I bought it I went through 3 other units that were defective right out of the box. What kept me loyal was the fact that ASUS is rated #1 by the Asian stock exchange for performance and reliability and that the salesman at Best Buy had me convinced that it was a wise choice.The first thing I noticed was the improvement in sound quality when using headphones. ASUS manufactures high-end audio amplifier boards and obviously includes them in their budget laptops which alone makes this a good choice for me. With everything else I'm not too fussy and I'm not at all dissatisfied with the kind of performance I'm getting as I'm using it mostly for email, general surfing and entertainment.Overall, I'm happy with it and when it finally s***s the bed I'll probably get another low end ASUS.", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sturdy, fast budget laptop", "Author": "Amirh Williams", "ReviewID": "R38EY4PGRSQZMX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought my Asus K52F on clearance at Best Buy for around $500.  The only difference between my K52F and the one advertised on this page is a slower Intel processor (P6100 that runs at 2.00GHz).  So I won't be factoring it in this review.Even so, I don't have any complaints about the computer's speed as it's very fast even for a multiple browser and tabbing fiend like me.  I don't recall my system ever lagging unless I was playing a CPU intensive game.  Even so, the lag never affected Windows Explorer or other programs.My favorite aspect about this laptop is that it's very sturdy.  Through the daily lumps and bumps, the only physical damage it has after a year and a half is the missing cover to the DVD drive that got hooked on my bookbag's zipper and yanked off.The battery lasts a good 3 or 4 hours on the right settings.  If you're willing to sacrifice just about everything to extend battery life, I'd dare say the battery might make it up to about 5 hours.The fan's no louder than a heavy sigh.  The keyboard is pretty quiet as well.  It's a chiclet design, which I personally find kind of ugly though.  After about 8 months or so, the tab key started popping off.  Fortunately, it pops back in just as easily.The screen's pretty crisp and bright.  I'd say it would make this laptop very nice for watching movies on...if the speakers weren't so bad.  The speakers, I'd say is this computer's biggest flaw.  They're situated UNDER the edge of the laptop and pointing towards the floor.  To make things worse, the speakers are very low.  I don't know what genius at Asus thought of this but he should be fired.The touchpad is something I've had an issue with from pretty much since I got it.  The pad has a rough surface that takes getting used to.  The buttons are kind of unresponsive, has forced me to rely on the multitouch trackpad (by Elantech) and even that gets glitchy and unresponsive from time to time. I don't know if it's the hardware or software that makes this touchpad so...bad.  I would like to know but unfortunately, Elan's drivers always find a way to reinstall themselves when I deleted the driver's files.  If somebody can answer this for me, please leave a comment below.Overall, I would buy another Asus laptop.  It's top notch performance and sturdy design has me holding high hopes for Asus's future products.", "Date": "January 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't Waste Your Money", "Author": "Cynthia L.
