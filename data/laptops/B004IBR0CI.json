{"Reviews": [{"Title": "HP Elitebook 2540 P", "Author": "Eric Janvrin", "ReviewID": "RI636HRRR82UC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We replaced HP Windows Vista dv4 5 year old laptop with this HP EliteBook 2540 P Windows 7 unit.  We were NOT interested in Windows 8 at this time, but could not find Windows 7 units from local retailers at the time we were seeking.  (Recently available again because there is still demand - hmmm.)  Purchased this reconditioned laptop and have found it to be much better than expected - very good condition, much better graphics, and small form factor.  We have used the unit for about 1 month and love it!  I have a long history with HP and value their products and performance.  Would buy another reconditioned unit through Amazon if a similar situation arose again!", "Date": "February 12, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "System Type: Notebook| Recommended Use: Small business, corporate business| Operating System: Microsoft Windows 7 Professional| CPU: Intel Core i7 640LM / 2.13 GHz| Max Turbo Speed: 2.933 GHz| Number of Cores: Dual-Core| Cache: L3 - 4 MB| 64-bit Computing: Yes| Power Efficiency: Low-Voltage (LV)| Chipset: Mobile Intel QM57 Express| Platform Technology: Intel vPro Technology| Features: Intel Turbo Boost Technology| RAM: 4 GB| Max RAM Supported: 8 GB| Technology: DDR3 SDRAM\nSpeed: 1333 MHz / PC3-10600| Form Factor: SO DIMM 204-pin| Slots Qty: 2| Hard Drive: 250 GB HDD| Interface: Serial ATA-300| Optical Drive: DVD\u00b1RW (\u00b1R DL) / DVD-RAM - fixed| Read Speed: 24x (CD) / 8x (DVD)| Write Speed: 24x (CD) / 8x (DVD\u00b1R) / 4x (DVD\u00b1R DL)| Rewrite Speed: 16x (CD) / 6x (DVD-RW) / 8x (DVD+RW) / 5x (DVD-RAM)| Type: 12.1| LCD Backlight Technology: LED backlight| Resolution: 1280 x 800 ( WXGA )| Widescreen: Yes| Features: Ambient light sensor, anti-glare\nGraphics Processor: Intel HD Graphics| Memory Allocation Technology: Dynamic Video Memory Technology 5.0| Camera: Integrated webcam| Resolution: 2 Megapixel| Sound: Stereo speakers , stereo microphone| Codec: IDT 92HD75B| Compliant Standards: High Definition Audio| Type: Keyboard, touchpad, pointing stick| Features: Spill-resistant| Wireless: 802.11n, Bluetooth 2.1 EDR| Bluetooth Class: Class 2| Network Interface: Gigabit Ethernet| Remote Management Protocol: SNMP\nCompliant Standards: IEEE 802.3, IEEE 802.3u, IEEE 802.3i, IEEE 802.3z, IEEE 802.3ab, IEEE 802.1p, IEEE 802.3x, IEEE 802.1x, Wi-Fi CERTIFIED| Protocols & Specifications: ITU V.21, ITU V.22, ITU V.22bis, ITU V.29, ITU V.32, ITU V.32bis, ITU V.34, ITU V.17, ITU V.23, ITU V.27ter, ITU V.8bis, ITU V.92, ITU V.80| Fax Compatibility: G3| Max Transfer Rate: 56 Kbps| Input: AC 120/230 V ( 50/60 Hz )| Slots: 1 x ExpressCard/34 ( 1 free )| Interfaces: 3 x USB 2.0\nMemory Card Reader: Yes ( SD Card, MultiMediaCard )| Software Included: HP Quick Launch Button Software, HP ProtectTools Security Manager, HP Client Manager Software (free download), HP Wireless Assistant, Synaptics Touchpad Driver, HP QuickLook 3, McAfee Total Protection for Small Business (60 days trial), HP Webcam Software", "Name": "EliteBook 2540p 12.1 Inch LED, Core i7 2.13GHz, 8 GB RAM, 120 GB HDD, DVD-Writer, 64-bit Windows 7 Pro Laptop", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51mNVLUmrfL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004IBR0CI"}}
