I am looking at my Asus monitor right now while I write this review, using my Asus motherboard (probably my 10th Asus mobo by now), and I have many other Asus products.Before I go any further, I want to express my gratitude and pleasure dealing with Asus' 24/7 Technical Support phone line. Asus is providing the level of one-on-one service that used to be the standard for all great tech companies. Unfortunately for consumers, this is now an extremely rare level of service. BIG kudos (and +1 star) to Asus for this!The K550-EH51T was a present for my wife. We have been using it for about 2 weeks now.Overall, this should have been a decent laptop PC. The screen is good, and the PC is fairly responsive for a Core i5 processor. I absolutely detest the Windows 8 O/S, but that is mostly fixable through free apps (like \"Classic Shell\") that give you back a full Windows 7 user interface.O/S issues aside, we have had two significant problems with our K550-EH51T:1) The touchpad has been acting erratically, where the cursor \"quivers\" and jumps randomly when using the touchpad. The cursor is almost impossible to control with the touchpad when this happens. I called Asus tech support on this, and they had me uninstall the touchpad driver (without deleting the drivers from the hard drive) and reboot the PC to have the drivers automatically detected and reinstalled. This has worked - for now - but I can't say that I believe it to be a solid solution. Fortunately, we don't need to use the touchpad much, so this wasn't a deal-killer for us.2) The installed WiFi adapter is constantly having issues. It is slow to make connection to websites. And, it randomly \"forgets\" the connection to my WiFi router. Sometimes, the WiFi adapter doesn't even show that there are any WiFi adapters available in the area, even though there are about a dozen. *THIS* is a deal-killer.I have tried resetting the PC to factory defaults (for that fresh, out-of-the-box feeling) a few times now. I have not been able to fix the WiFi problems yet.At this point, the laptop has (a) sporadic hardware problems; and/or (b) driver problems.I am making one last-ditch effort to reinstall Win 8.1, and associated drivers. Maybe this last time will fix everything.If not, I will return this laptop to Amazon, and replace it with the same model.Stay tuned ... I will update this review with my progress.********************************************2014-JAN-10:Reinstalling Win 8.1/drivers did not work. Sending laptop back to Amazon for a replacement. I will let you know how Asus laptop #2 works out.********************************************2014-JAN-14:The replacement laptop arrived from Amazon. WiFi is failing in exactly the same ways. There must be a driver or hardware issue with the Qualcomm Atheros chipset (Other manufacturers are having similar issues with this chipset). I will be returning this Asus laptop, and purchasing something else.Bummer.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "First review", "Author": "Scott Ross", "ReviewID": "R292I09MUOK9JR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this laptop, loads up fast, touch screen,  even though I heard a lot of negative reviews about windows 8, I love it so far, easy access to my emails, games, internet etc. all with a touch of a fingerI've read the negative reviews about this laptop no backlight, hinges are weak, touchpad not working properlyWell good thing I took typing classes back in high school backlight is not needed, hinges have no sign of weariness yet.. touchpad works perfect for me.

The only difference and a real pain about Asus laptops is the backlit keyboard.  One of the most underrated and overlooked option on a good laptop.  The problem I have with Asus laptops is that figuring out if if they have a backlit keyboard or not is such a pain.", "Date": "December 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Do not buy an ASUS laptop", "Author": "Karen", "ReviewID": "R1GAIECTG8NKCC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The hinge mechanism is faulty workmanship. I bought the laptop in August 2013. The hinge broke and because it is molded to the LCD, ASUS is expecting me to pay $165 as well as shipping ($30.00) for the repair. ASUS will not stand by its warranty even though the hinge initially broke after my owning it only 2 weeks. I have never written a negative review before. However, my frustration with ASUS is extremely high. Repeated emails from a local computer repair man, who is officially sanctioned by ASUS for repairs, have not resulted in anything. He, also, has decided to break all ties with ASUS after this incident.", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "NICE", "Author": "Lester", "ReviewID": "R1Q8NZ1SDUKQ9F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "beatiful constructed machine, but have a big flawwwww.... you dont know when caps is looked because the machine doesnt have an indicator.....but overall its nice", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00F3TZCEC"}}
