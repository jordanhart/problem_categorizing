(I dropped my old laptop on ground).  Wanted cheap, easy laptop without frills and didn't want to pay for features I would not use.  This laptop is perfect!  Good keyboard, separate number pad, it works great for emails, internet surfing and low-tech stuff like that.  Got a great deal with free shipping.  I am extremely happy with this purchase.", "Date": "September 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very useful", "Author": "Baseball21C", "ReviewID": "R1F3HH7T9QKKON", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned expensive computers before(ie Macbook pro) when I bought this computer I was impressed by its price and usefulness. It is very capable of doing everything other big name laptops do, the screen resolution is impressive, and it is easy to use. I enjoyed owning this computer and think it is great for casual and even intensive use(I used it to code C++ for a while). The price makes it a no brainer.", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "worthless warranty", "Author": "shadow", "ReviewID": "R3ESAW8R4J7YVY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Line and double image developed in screen after only 3 months.
