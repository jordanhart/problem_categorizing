I needed an inexpensive netbook because my recent tablet fried itself. The netbook arrived in excellent condition. Out of the box it was up and working. I needed to spend about 8 hours going through updates to the Windows operating system. But i expected having to reboot after upgrades, since this has happened before with other computers who had an initial image of the WIN 7 operating system when it was manufactured, but needed to catch up. Keyboard is acceptable. Glide mouse works great. Sreen is ample when I am in Starbucks, but I plug into a larger Acer flat screen when I work from home.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "This Little Computer gets my school work done.", "Author": "Kelsey Marquez", "ReviewID": "R2IWRWBHLHNA6J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is the best thing, I think, I could have found for the size and specs I wanted. I'm not crazy about the 1 GHz however it does have more Ram then most little computers, I believe. I am very please with it; I was nervous about getting a computer small then my Viao, but I really do like it. I would have to say what I don't like about it is the top is a finger print magnet and the charger hook up is kinda tricky to plug in.  It is a bit slow, but that's only because I'm going from a 2.4 GHz to a 1. All in all, it's little, a Windows 7 (yay!) and gets what I need for my classes done. I would recommend this computer.", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent", "Author": "Tracy Kingsley", "ReviewID": "R3MMUK07BV9411", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easy to use.... and carry.

I'm not crazy about Windows 7 and I'm a techno dummy, but I got it working okay. Wi-fi connect was quick. I've ordered a mouse because many online complaints the touch pad quits working, and a mouse is easier to use. And I've ordered speakers because my only real complaint about this computer is that the audio is barely above a whisper. I thought it could be improved, but I've tried everything, including downloading the Realtek driver to no avail. The external speakers aren't expensive. This suits my needs, and weighs less than most, which was an important consideration for me. For my needs I prefer the 11.6\", 2.6-lb size With the technology changing so rapidly it didn't make sense to me to buy a high priced laptop. At this price--even adding the mouse and the speakers--this is at least a 3-star. Without the speaker problem it would be a 4-star.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Acer Aspire/Windows 7 meets expectations", "Author": "Peter R Michaelson", "ReviewID": "R24QHXRHTD62N8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is light and portable and works as well as a Windows PC does.  It's more portable than I expected.  FWIW I need a PC running Windows 7 for one of my apps - Raytech navigation software, which interfaces with the instruments on my boat via ethernet.  All that works fine; working the interface was easier than my experience with prior computers.  The other functions - WiFi interface, word processing, spreadsheets, email, web browsing, backing up, virus protection, all A-OK.  Only complaint would be all the bundled software kept putting up popup screens I did not want, until I removed the offending programs.  Sometimes it was hard to discern which programs were offending, sort of a trial and error thing.Oh yes - price is as good as you're gonna find for a new laptop.  My bottom line was $337.62 including a 12 v. charger.  Acer has a Chrome version in a similar form factor which you may find for less, if you don't mind Windows 8.", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "besides all its bad qualities i still rate five star", "Author": "Amy", "ReviewID": "R3ONI08U9Z6M86", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "because it fit my primary needs at a ok price.i can finally take my laptop to take note in classes!it's light and skinny and works just fine. it's kind of cute.it does not has bluetooth.it's not very slow as i first thought it was.Screen: not the bright knd, kind of like my kindle ,so i feel like it's good for my eyes, doesnot drain my eyes like my former more expensive laptop.and the keyboard and mousepad is crappy, only 1.5 months of use, the left ctrl key is half dead.the mouse pad gives unpredicted and unwanted click randomly,so when i type, the cursor would just jump to other places!! so annoying. but i learned to place the mouse in a good place of the screen, like in saving.the keyboard layout is good. not very compact, i type a lot, and it's not tiring or uncomfortable.all in all, perfect for students daily use. i love my little aspire v5! i'd recommend it to girls.", "Date": "March 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Overall good but iffy touchpad", "Author": "Eric Schneider", "ReviewID": "R1H2KLAA84J2IM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Size and function is good.
