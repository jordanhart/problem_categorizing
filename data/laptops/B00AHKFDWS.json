The solutions I have found via the internet only work intermittently so for up to 10 minutes at a time I cannot use my mouse, and therefore what I can do with the computer is very limited.

I HATE windows 8.  My husband complains about it every time we use this laptop.  Better to buy a touchscreen if you have to get windows 8 since it's designed for that purpose.  I didn't want to pay the extra money for the touch option (and still don't).  I hate that if I open a pdf and then go back to the desktop to write a document, the pdf keeps popping up mistakenly.  I guess I'm doing something weird with the mousepad that makes that happen.  It happens repeatedly to the point of madness!!!  I also feel like the computer freezes a lot and I have to do a hard reboot.  I can't even get the cntrl-alt-delete to work.Keyboard touch is great.  Picture is great.

I read all of the reviews on Amazon and elsewhere, and for the money, this HP Pavilion is the best deal. I needed a basic computer for home use. I am not thinking about traveling with the laptop, I use my iPad for traveling.It arrived well packaged. The instructions were clear. I was able to hook it up to my Wi-Fi with ease. The screen is very clear, and better than I had hoped. The 15.6-inch HD BrightView LED-backlit display provides good resolution and outstanding brightness and color. The touchpad is off center which is a little different, but was able to work around that without difficulty. I don't play films on my computer, but this one came with the Netflix app. I have used HP Pavilions frequently, so am quite used to their performance.It took me a while to get used to the Windows 8 OS, but I find I am OK with it. You are never too old to learn new ideas and work with new systems, it is the way of the computer world. You get used to it and adjust. The color on this HP screen is remarkable, and I am very impressed with the resolution.For the money, this is the best computer I have found. It is lightweight and compact. This computer does not get 'hot' like others. It has all the features I want and need. I like the previous HP computers I have used, and I am not too fussy. I want a computer that works well, has the features I use and need, and is dependable.The only complaint I have is that it comes with Norton Security, which I deleted.Recommended. prisrob 10-29-13", "Date": "October 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "A sports car from a sedan.", "Author": "Charles M Collins", "ReviewID": "RDVL8OZ5VO42K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is a fine running machine.

Thanks Mr. Gates I know a destitute guy like you needs the money. And thanks to HP for your part in this yoking. As for me a refurbished High End Vista or XP machine will be just fine.

Yes. Windows 8 is different. Yes, it would be better for a tablet. Yes, it is annoying, and Yes, I wish this laptop had vista instead. I had to first uninstall several of the programs on here (of course I instantly got rid of the bloatware), and then reinstall them in order for them to work (netflix, skype). Now that we are over that, lets get to how awesome this laptop is!!This laptop has many wonderful qualities!  The sound is absolutely amazing and will not require for me to have any additional speakers added even though I will set up my surround sound. The keyboard is a little bit smaller than I am used to, but I have quickly adjusted to it. It does have a number key pad which is good because I am constantly dealing with numbers. The screen is clean, and crisp, the webcam is just average though. I thought that it would be as nice as my logitech, but no. the touchpad is textured. This I find to like as most laptops I have used are smooth, this is really annoying because it seems that the slightest touch will move the cursor. This does not seem to be the case with this. Also with it being textured your finger doesnt.... stick LOL! The system is very fast, but I wouldnt think of this as a gaming system till you at least upgrade the RAM. It is expandable to 8GB. If all you do is go onto Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Amazon, blah blah blah.... AKA just surf and connect with friends, then this is an AWESOME laptop. If you are a gamer who wants something on the go, then feel free to get this one, but make sure that you upgrade the hell out of it.The body is a sparkly black, nothing to really write home to the family about, but it is nice.
