{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sturdy machine", "Author": "Travis Molony", "ReviewID": "R29BMM6ZC927XP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had a Dell Latitude D630 for almost 2 years now and there's one key feature that needs to be pointed out first. It's solid. Although I've never dropped it, it has been through a lot. It's very difficult to warp the LCD screen by applying pressure to the back of the display, and the screen is recessed a fair bit from the outside edges. I've seen quite a few people crack their screens but you'd have to try pretty hard to break this one. At first glance it appears thin, plastic, and flimsy; but when you pick it up and hold it you can tell there is a strong network of metal bracings underneath the surface.When I bought mine brand new from Dell, quite a few technical things went wrong. First the touchpad never worked well out of the box. It skips, freezes and stops working intermittently. I understand this is a big problem with Dell laptops. The other joystick style mouse works well, but after a year started occasionally drifting to the top right of my screen at slow speed so I had to disable it. I usually use an external mouse anyway. After having the laptop for about a year, a section of the motherboard fried and the computer kept giving me video driver errors, but after I called Dell they politely came to my home and swapped the defective part free of charge. I play my fair share of PC games and this thing gets hot. Sometimes the bottom of the laptop will become uncomfortable to set on your thighs so I'm not surprised the board burned out. It's important to note that this machine only gets hot when it's running a video game. It usually runs at normal temperatures doing everything else. I invested in a fan cooling pad which does a good job keeping it cool.Other than the mouse and heat issues, it's a good machine. It's a nicely sized laptop as well. Personally I feel like it's not too big or too small.UPDATE April 20, 2012:Even though nobody is probably still buying these machines, I'd like to report on my D630 almost three years after my original review was written.It has been almost five years with the D630 and it's still functioning, of course not as well. The cooling fan is not as strong as it used to be, and the machine gets pretty hot when running multiple programs or playing video (years of dust accumulation probably affects the heat sink's ability to transfer heat to some degree, no pun intended). Lucky for me I don't play video games any longer, as I now see them as a waste of time, so that will no doubt lessen the damaging impact to my hardware. Right now with only Firefox open the machine is a normal temperature. The wireless card periodically stops working and I must disable and re-enable it to get it to work again. Some of the keyboard keys have become very sensitive probably due to debris underneath, but all are still registering. The touchpad still occasionally acts up by sometimes not detecting my finger in a specific area toward the center of the pad causing my pointer to leap as I cross over it, but for some odd reason flicking it a few times gets it to work properly again, and other times it goes completely unresponsive until I restart the computer. The pointing stick stopped tracking slowly across my screen and has become fully functional, albeit awkward to use. The original battery has died and I'm currently on my second. Dell let me keep a brand new optical drive after they misdiagnosed a hardware issue (DVD drive failed to detect discs) that turned out to be another fried motherboard making it twice I've had the motherboard swapped under warranty, so my DVD drive still works flawlessly. Hopefully it won't happen again since the warranty expired almost two year ago; the original warranty being three years covering everything but the battery and LCD display. The screen is still very clear with no dead pixels.Not much else to report besides the system's performance benefited from a OS reinstallation. A comment below mentions bluescreens, but I think bluescreens are more due to badly written software than the machine itself.", "Date": "August 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Dell D630 review", "Author": "Matthew Coffey", "ReviewID": "R3LY1QV1ID3U7F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Dell D630 is a remarkable machine. I work for a university that is replacing older model laptops with the D630. This laptop was given to me for testing purposes and I must say I enjoy the features and durability it has provided me.The hardware is more than adequate for the needs of our students. The Core 2 Duo processor isn't top of the line but will run most operating systems flawlessly. I tested this one with Windows XP, Windows Vista and am presently running OpenSuSe 11.1. The machine I am using comes with 2 Gigs of ram but can be upgraded to 4 gig. The only time I notice any ram issues is when I am doing video intensive work while the 3D desktop in SuSe is turned on. The resolution only maxes out at 1440X900, but the clarity of the LCD screen more than compensates for that. The 4 USB ports are also a nice addition to the machine. There are other Dell Latitude's I've experienced that only provide two ports.The durability of this machine is more than one would expect from a Dell product. With previous Dell laptops I easily pop keys off and have even cracked a screen by dropping only 10 inches. The D630 has given me a new found hope of the durability of Dell laptops. I have knocked it off the table without any issue. I have left it in my vehicle overnight (-10 degrees) and it was just fine. My children have used and abused this laptop. All it seems to require is a nice wipe down and it looks as nice as the day the machine was given to me.The only things I would like to see improved on is a SD-card reader built in. Maybe a little better speaker set. I believe there is only one speaker built into this machine. There is no S-video port on this machine. With previous Dell's in my possession, there have always been S-video and I have become acclimated to having one on my machine. The D630 also appears to be a little heavier than what I am use to using. I don't mind lugging my laptop around but I other people I talk with say they would never carry anything that heavy with them for work.

I did not even know that they have it here on Amazon Marketplace too. Even though the description said manufacturer refurbished the laptop I received looked like new. It came with power adapter and a Dell Windows XP Reinstallation CD and built in Intel PROSet Wireless Card. Absolutely no bloatware is included.Now this may not be a top of the line machine but it is pretty adequate for home and school or even Small Home Office use. The neat part is that once you boot up the machine for the first time it would automatically install Windows XP after going through some preliminary steps. It even gives you option to enter setup and configure things but you are better off leaving the machine alone to do its thing and install windows XP or whichever operating system it is bundled with unless you're techie. Once windows finishes installation you can pretty much install anything you want. I have so far installed Open Office, MS Office 2003, Firefox, Chrome, Avast Anti Virus, Trusteer Rapport security Software and many other productivity softwares and the machine boots up and runs smoothly.It does not come with webcam so I installed Logitech Quickcam Pro 9000 and Microsoft Lifecam Cinema and either camera runs smoothly even on HD modes. I use Lifecam Cinema more often because it's stand is perfect fit for D630 bezel as opposed to the Quickcam Pro 9000's stand which tend to wobble.I will advise you buy this laptop directly from Dell either here on Amazon Marketplace or on ebay where it is listed under Dell_Financial_Services. You will likely receive a laptop that will be like new but more importantly you will get 30 days warranty.This laptop is of right price, size and specs: 14\" bright LCD, 2GB Ram, 80GB harddisk space and 2GHZ Intel Dual Core processor that is more than adequate for most home, school and or Small Home Office use. It is sturdy and sleek looking too.There is one thing that Dell scrimped on here: the tiny single speaker that is barely audible! I use an external Frisby USB laptop Speakers. I also use headphone when I am on the road. It is worthy to note that this tiny speaker belies a powerful sound card that only becomes apparent when you put on a headphone.NB: Don't forget to switch on the wireless radio or you will not be able to use the wifi connection. The switch is on same side and next to the headphone jack. It is switched off by default. Once you switch it on it will detect a bunch of wifi hot spots including yours, if any. Select your SSID from the displayed options and enter your router's WEP Key and you will be good to go. I have at&t; 2WIRE Wireless Gateway and the WEP Key is the ten digit number directly below the serial number located on the side or bottom of the router depending on whether it is standing vertically or lying on it's side. The built in wireless card is powerful. I highly recommend this laptop to anyone who may be on budget but not willing to compromise on quality and performance.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Small but powerful", "Author": "Eduardo L. Nieves", "ReviewID": "R343TFOFT78ZJ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Laptop functions are average but this is probably my favorite Dell laptop. I'm not a Dell fan but knew this D630 model has great up time. Most users have them for years without issues and need a work horse that is reliable.1) Very easy to upgrade, up to the Intel T7800 processor, original was T7100.2) The model I have has the Intel integrated video. There are other D630 that have the Nvidia option, not for me. Nvidia has serious GPU issues with heat, conventional cooling methods don't work and in a year or so, some sooner will fail. Having the Intel GM965 is much better for this machine.3) RAM is a surprise, I put 4gigs of DDR2 and it worked. Now I am looking at the Intel Turbo Cache module which goes in to one of the two mini PCI-e slots inside, also easy to access.4) The last thing is the display option is selectable to higher resolution; mine is 1280x800 but if you got the money go to 1440x900. Since the display is 14.1 inch the 1280x800 is optimal for me.My hobby is to fix these laptops for family and friends; yes I took community college courses to help with the technical learning curve. Seen many bad laptop designs which are hard to work on. D630 is by far the easiest one to maintain and upgrade. Highly recommend this model for everyday use. The Intel Core 2 Duo is still a relevant processor today, as good as the i3 or AMD mobile dual core.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "An Underrated Workhorse", "Author": "Colin", "ReviewID": "R15WXY1I7M9UV1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop because I needed a laptop to carry around with me to work and school. My regular laptop was expensive, very bulky, and felt a bit flimsy, and I wanted something a bit more durable that I wouldn't have to worry about breaking, but that was still a workhorse. I work at a computer repair shop at my university, and we take in a lot of laptops. Of all of the laptops we work on, I found the D630 to be one of the easiest to maintenance. When I was looking for a work laptop, I wanted a business laptop that could handle the tasks I needed it to accomplish and was easy to repair if need be, but was still within my limited college student budget. I searched around for a while, and a refurbished D630 for about $300 was what I came up with. Everything else was either overpriced or unimpressive and old. I decided to take the risk of getting a refurbished laptop for so cheap, and I am extremely satisfied.  When I got the computer it came pre-installed with XP pro, and I decided to set up a dual boot with Ubuntu. Ubuntu installed extremely easily and all of the drivers were ready to go right away. The computer has had no trouble doing anything I set it to so far, and has exceeded my expectations. I learned that some of these machines had video card problems in which the video card would overheat and cause screen splitting, but that is only with the models that have nVidia GPUs. As long as you choose to purchase one with an Intel GPU that recall issue is not a problem.  As far as how the laptop functions and works with the user, I am very impressed. The keys feel very ergonomic and natural when typing, and the area where you rest your palms is a very comfortable texture and size. The touchpad is easy to use and allows your finger to slide along it without much difficult, unlike some laptops on which the touchpad grips your finger and makes using it more of a hassle. A lot of laptops also are made of very cheap, easy-to-break plastics and feel very flimsy, but the D630 feels more rugged and durable with its magnesium casing. I can't say anything about the battery life because my D630 came with an old battery, a risk I took when buying a refurbished laptop. I've only heard good things about how long they last when not plugged in, however, and am buying a new battery as soon as possible. The 2 GHz Intel dual core processor works very smoothly and efficiently, and with 2 GB of RAM most applications run smoothly. Overall, I am very satisfied with this laptop and feel like it is an underrated machine, and I would definitely recommend it for anyone who needs an inexpensive laptop.", "Date": "December 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fits the bill", "Author": "Lisa Lisario \"starbell1979\"", "ReviewID": "R1Y2X4PXKB4P9H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was happy to find this laptop for such a reasonable price.

I got this model my freshman year of college in Spring 2007. It's always been strong and has resisted numerous drops, bangs, and dings. I've had Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and now Ubuntu on it. The only problems I've ever had with it have been normal wear and tear to the harddrive and batteries, which I have subsequently replaced several times over the years. This laptop can get hot if you run too many intensive applications at a time.This really has been the only laptop I've ever owned. Even in the year 2013, well after its lifecycle, this machine can perform all the basic tasks for the common consumer: word processing, web browsing, and some light gaming. I've never felt the need to replace it. It's almost become like a second pet to me after my dog. Sounds weird? Except that I've traveled all over the world with it: Europe, Canada, Australia, Japan, and on several roadtrips across America. Even after being tugged around in numerous hotels and airports, it doesn't seem to be having any problems.I may one day get a new laptop once my needs change, but I'll probably still keep this tucked away with my pictures and old Nintendo systems for nostalgic purposes.

I have never tried a netbook but this computer works great and except for the fact that it is heavy, I bet it works a lot better then any of those netbooks yet it is cheaper at this point.  I have to say I do not have any software on it except Windows 7 and Case Catalyst (court reporting software). The start up time and wake up from sleep time is most excellent.  It also travels well, fits nicely into a small computer backpack and is great.  I would recommend it highly if anyone is in need of a windows computer for a specific software.  I am a Mac user but going to school for Court Reporting I needed a windows computer for CaseCat and this one is excellent.  It is faster and better then all the computers in the school and it works great with Windows 7.  Obviously the screen res is not that great, and most tablets are nicer to watch videos on, but it is ok too.I would mostly recommend it if you need a Windows computer for a specific software.  Great for a college student and great for a professional who needs to run Case Catalyst.  I updated to a low end ASUS which hasn't arrived yet and my only hope is that it runs as nice as this one and the startup and wake up from sleep time are at least equal to this one.  I only updated because of the weight mostly.  Carrying a Steno machine and a computer makes weight important, but I don't need a powerhouse computer.  Will be giving this one to my father where he only runs financial software.  He will love how nice and fast this computer is compared to his slow desktop he has now.  It is also great for surfing the web and all that stuff.  Battery life is not that great with the one it comes with or the ones that you can by new that are the same size.  They do sell extended batteries, there is the Dell one, but that one is over $100 as much as the computer can be gotten these days.  Then they sell aftermarket extended batteries on ebay.  I got one and it worked excellent, made the computer last about 3.5 hours with not heavy use, just using CaseCat.  But the battery itself went bad, and not recognized by computer after a short time, so even though the extended battery is sold for $25 not sure whether it was just the particular one of if it happens a lot with that after market battery so not sure if it is worth it to get those after market extended batteries or if I just got a bad one.  Maybe make sure if you get one on ebay that it promises a year warranty.Pros: Sturdy, startup and wake up time fastCons: Heavy for laptop these days and screen rez and the power chord is also bulky and heavy.", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Maquina Muy Potente", "Author": "Asdrubal", "ReviewID": "R9E7Y70BZNSO5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Con este equipo puedo sobrevivir a var\u00edas actualizaciones de Sistemas operativos.
