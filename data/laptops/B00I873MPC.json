It can do pretty much everything I wanted it to do, such as playing video, surfing the internet, making online purchase. etc. So far it has been running smoothly and I think it's well worth the price I paid.", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good value for a low end laptop", "Author": "A. Wheland", "ReviewID": "R1S9L8VZ410LUE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The C55-A5190 is a good value for a lower end laptop. It has a dual core 2.13Ghz-2.39Ghz(factory over clocked) processor that is NOT A TRUE 2.4Ghz as advertised. It is great for office applications and good for surfing the web. Plenty of ports to plug things in, even a 3.0 USB. Graphics for this system(along with slower processor) does not work well for most new games though it is HD with a HDMI port which could be used on your HD TV for streaming or general multi media applications. Over all a good computer for the value.", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Why I choose this laptop", "Author": "Al Boland", "ReviewID": "R27BWKKD09BU9T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Top five reasons in order:1.

Flimsy, cheap, unreliable, and built with the cheapest components available. Save your money and spend a bit more on something else not built by Toshiba. Best case scenario, you might get 6-12 months out of your laptop before things start to fail. Worse case scenario (as I've just experienced), your laptop will last a matter of weeks before the lights go out. And unfortunately for the buyer, Toshiba often refuses to meet their own warranty obligations. Considering how cheap the laptops are, they don't want to help you, or fix the laptop. They would lose money otherwise. So if you send it in for repairs, like they'll inevitably recommend, you'll find yourself being asked to pay elaborate sums of money because the 'scope of work' is not within the boundaries of the original warranty agreement. This of course is not true. Toshiba is simply trying to force the added costs of warranty repairs down the throats of uninformed customers. Their laptops are cheap, but they won't actually save you any money in the long run.Save your money. Don't buy Toshiba. Consider any laptops made by Toshiba as being purely disposable, or built for third word countries with no consumer protection laws.", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00I873MPC"}}
