Built in Intel HD graphics are average. Not recommended for gameplay but for everyday apps its great. Speakers are below average but speaker jack sound is great which works for me.500 GB HD is 5400 speed. 1.3M camera & Under 5 pounds - Perfect.", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Exactly as expected", "Author": "dealshopper", "ReviewID": "R1ZTNBHHQNT1XM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received the notebook, in less then two weeks.

The computer works great.  It has a couple little quirks, for instance,1.it will only accept the password for the administrator login when it first boots up, if it goes to sleep and I wake it up, it no longer recognizes the password. and 2. the clear system/reboot program always opens up upon first login, I've almost accidentally accepted and cleared my computer a couple of times.  Otherwise I've had the computer for over a year and it is still fast and it still looks and works great.  Pretty glad I bought this computer even more than a year later.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Intel Core i5-480M ; Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit\n4GB DDR3 Memory; 500GB Hard Drive\n14\" HD Screen (1366 x 768)\n3 x USB 2.0; 1 x VGA; 1 x HDMI\n1.3 Megapixel HD Webcam", "Name": "Acer 14\" i5-480M 2.66 GHz Laptop | AS4743-6481", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31xfo4%2BFdgL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B006GXSPOI"}}
