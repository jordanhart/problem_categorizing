You will not regret getting it  :)", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Incredible.", "Author": "Alex Ellsworth", "ReviewID": "R1WK8DAL2EJBB0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is a monster. Extremely powerful machine. I replaced my gaming rig for this to be more portable. Plays games on all high quality without any issues. Put a Samsung 840 Pro 256GB ssd in this thing and with Rapid Mode enabled, I am pushing over 1.2GB/s read & write. Also upgraded the RAM to 12GB 1600MHz. The battery on power saver I get between 12-16 hours (wifi/bluetooth on, screen brightness turned down). On high performance on the battery while playing games (using the radeon graphics card), I get about 3-5 hours of straight gaming (GTA IV, BF3, BeamNG.Drive).Things I do not like: I hate the wireless card. Cannot stand it, Intel needs to completely redesign the drivers because it is just crap. Constantly having to type in the wireless password over and over. Uninstalled/Reinstalled/Old/New drivers, nothing fixes it. Thinking about upgrading the wireless card to the Intel AC Dual Band card.", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent choice", "Author": "Juan Casal", "ReviewID": "R39961LJR6W1X4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted to buy a new laptop and since i used to own a Samsung previously i chose this model.

At the time it was the best at its price point, and it still boasts some rather impressive specs. The one flaw of this computer is the mouse which does not have stand alone buttons for right and left clicking. I knew this when I bought it and had thought that I'd adapt, but even after six months of use it continues to be difficult nigh impossible to use. I like Samsung products, but this really kills the user experience. I'll probably stick with a more expensive thinkpad in the future rather than fight with this.Samsung if you read this then please stop using this type of mouse on your products because I'd really like to keep your products as potentials.", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00CAXSE7G"}}
