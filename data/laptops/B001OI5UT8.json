{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Buyer Beware - Poor Long Term Quality with Qosmio", "Author": "KEK", "ReviewID": "RH4U55OYW2W09", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I puchased a Qosmio and right after the warranty ran out the lcd screen went blank. Turns out this laptop has a defective motherboard and it costs as much to fix this as it would to just buy a new laptop. I contacted Toshiba and although this is a known issue (found through search on the internet) they will not back up a defective product. We have other laptops older than this one that have worked wonderfully for over 5 years. I would not trust the Toshiba motherboard in the Qosmio - they are defective and Toshiba will not stand behind their product.", "Date": "June 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very disappointed", "Author": "S.

Just like others have reported. I described the failure to several electronics salespeople who said that happens when you don't buy their extended warranty. I looked at them, expecting them to grin. But they were serious - they think the manufacturer has some way to kill them. I have trouble believing that. But I paid a lot for it and loved its fabulous screen. The screen is not what failed, but an internal part. Toshiba should make good on this problem regardless of warranty. Until they do, buy from another manufacturer.", "Date": "May 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Defective after warranty", "Author": "Nasenbaer", "ReviewID": "R2FUZKL6EL5D1A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After some month after warranty of using the device went to a blanc screen. No BIOS visible anymore just the ventilator is getting into full power. My expert of Laptops opened the device. CPU is fully working. RAM and Screens seems to be ok. Motherboard is defective but costs huge. Before that, the device have 2 harddisks and is stable. Thats why I would buy it again without this Thoshiba fault.", "Date": "March 10, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001OI5UT8"}}
