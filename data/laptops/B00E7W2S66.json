I am not a large person and my fingers are of moderate size, but this keyboard (I'm not speaking of the keys here obviously) actually sinks into the laptop when you type anywhere in the left region. I would actually return it if I did not live in the Caribbean, it's way too costly to ship back from here..", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lenovo G500s 59380376 15.6\" Laptop i5 8GB 1TB", "Author": "C.

I bought it in the spring and I am kicking myself for not waiting to get it at these prices. This will last me for at least 2 years before I upgrage, and I usually upgrade every year because I do all my work on my computer. The style is very clean and sleek. The huge hard drive is fast and efficient. The i7 processor and powerful graphics card let me run more applications and keep more browser windows open than I ever need. Also my kids play high-end games on it and play it all the time. For $550 this one is a STEAL and IO recommend it to everyone who wants a high end laptop for mid-range prices!

The company I purchased it through on here says they only cover the situation if it happens within 7 days of receipt.  So I have to pay to send it back to Lenovo for repairs.  I paid $570.00 for it originally and less than a month later I have to pay more money to send it back.  Lenovo states that they will repair it and set it back to factory settings and pay to ship it back to me....but now I have lost material that was entered, loss of time needed to work on it, and money out-of-pocket....Just not a happy camper at this time.  :(", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lenovo laptop", "Author": "Amy", "ReviewID": "R2QECCSVJX9RMV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The original description was for a touch screen, my main reason for purchasing it however when I received it, it was not a touchscreen.

He didn't have that much money to spend and the specs on this seemed great for the price. He loves it, in terms of processor speed and when he's playing, he says the wait times are comparable if not better than his older brothers HP (which cost more). He said some of the software was kind of, well not typical namebrand so like instead of Windows Media Player it was Lenovo Media Player. But that didn't bother him at all, it would be a fairly easy fix to download Itunes or whatever and be done. He is really happy with it.The laptop isn't smooth, it's kind of ridged but I actually liked the feel of it.
