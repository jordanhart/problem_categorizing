It would spontaneously shut down and not restart.  It worked for a day or two after coming back from repairs, then did the same thing again.  I sent it in for repairs again but when I got it back several weeks later, it still didn't work.  Same problem, even though they had replaced many of the major parts.  Toshiba offered to send me a replacement -- the same model but with a bigger hard drive, more RAM, improved graphics, faster processor, but refurbished, not new.  I agreed, hoping for the best.  But no luck with that one either.  Within one day, it died.  Battery won't charge and no life in it at all, even plugged in.  Going on 2 months now without a working laptop.  Stay away from this model!", "Date": "October 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "what's up with the screen going white", "Author": "J.
