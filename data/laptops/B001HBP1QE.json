{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great for a while but not made to last", "Author": "littlewhitewolf", "ReviewID": "R1PFM5LH3TAOYP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had this computer for a year and a half and was happy with it up until recently. I am a graduate student and when I first got this computer it had exactly what I needed and did everything wonderfully and in some ways still does. I was completely impressed by this computer. It was fast at completing all tasks when I got it and a year later after much usage and lots of space taken up it is still just as fast. It's a beautiful, sleek looking computer and it comes with a lot of great features. It has small lights that act as buttons at the top of the keyboard you lightly put your finger on and they do tasks such as launching itunes, muting audio, and playing/stopping/fastforwarding movies so you don't have to navigate to other windows or the desktop to complete tasks. It also has labelflash which is useful if you want custom labeled dvd's. I have burned hundreds of dvds and cds with this computer and have never had any problems and the burner is still going strong. I've never had any issues connecting to wireless internet and have even used this computer to connect to other computers wirelessly to transfer documents. I can have multiple windows and tabs open and it doesn't effect the speed of the computer. I can run games easily and it plays programs flawlessly. It has three usb outlets and I am able to run a usb mouse, a printer, and a usb disk at the same time if I need to. This computer in many ways is great.It does have its not so great points though and the main one is that its parts broke down fast. Around three months after I got this computer I started having issues with the screen flickering. At first it only did it on rare occasions so I didn't think much about it, but after while, after it was too late for returns, it flickered worse and worse. Four months ago I couldn't move the laptop from my desk for fear of flickering. The screen eventually went out and I had to replace it. It's been three months since then and the screen worked fine after I replaced it until a few weeks ago when the flickering returned. I'm afraid I am going to have to replace another part in the laptop, either the display cable or another part. If you do your research toshiba laptops are notorious for having screens go out along with other parts even when they are fairly new. This is a huge drawback and if I had done better research beforehand I wouldn't have bought this laptop.A second minor issue is one small turnwheel. The laptop has a small turnwheel on the front you can use to turn volume up and down. This stopped working pretty soon after I got the laptop but this hasn't really impacted me much because I rarely used it anyway.Another issue I am having is that I have had to replace the power cord. I do not move my laptop around much.  It usually sits stationary on my desk so I find it odd the power cord has a short in it when I barley move the laptop off of one spot. So far I have put a lot of money into fixing problems I shouldn't have had to deal with at early times in a laptops life. Instead of fixing the screen again I am just going to hook it up to an external monitor and let it sit stationary on my desk and use it as an at home computer because my screen issues have made it too unreliable to trust in the future. It's not a good computer to travel to school and home with and doesn't seem to react well to you opening and closing it and I think that is what is causing my current screen issues. Instead of putting more money into fixing my toshiba satellite I am just going to buy a new laptop. I have loved this laptop because it has been great with the exception of the repair issues I've had. I've accomplished a lot of work using this machine and it has produced well for me. I am sad to have to give up on this one after trying so hard to get it to work correctly but putting more money into it isn't a possiblity now because I need a laptop for school that isn't going to break down again and I can't be sure this one won't.", "Date": "October 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not Reliable", "Author": "OccasionalAmazonShopper", "ReviewID": "ROGF7412OK6S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop in March 2009. It was fast, had good video and sound--for a month, then we had video problems. The faulty hard drive and defective LCD cable harness were replaced in warranty. Today, 11/02/2010, it would not power up. I will have to pay $425 for a motherboard replacement. When it worked, it worked well, but to have to replace the main board, hard drive and video cable within two years is ridiculus. The reliability of this model is very questionable.", "Date": "November 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Never again!", "Author": "Keomi", "ReviewID": "R3KX94J5Y9NYYP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this Toshiba laptop 3 years ago. Since then, my screen started flickering then it just went completely white, now its doing a long flash that prevents me from doing my work properly or watch a movie in peace. My keyboard is not working anymore and it's just pushing off an odd heat now. Looking at other people's comments, we all have the same issues. This is an unreliable machine and I would NEVER buy another Toshiba device again. Horrible! And here i thought HP was the worst!

At the 1.5 year mark, the screen started to flicker and died not long after that. I had to hook it up to an external monitor and used it as a 'desktop' because I figured the repair cost was too much.  It hobbled on for another 1.5 years then died completely. I think my experience with Toshiba's poor reliability is very common, judging from reading many others' similar experience. I would never buy another Toshiba computer based on so many complaints by so many people. By the way, my 8-year-old Sony laptop is still going strong, slow but working still.", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "good for college", "Author": "K.

First off, it takes entirely too long to power up and load the O/S.  You might as well grab a drink, or check your mail, after hitting the power button, cause you aren't doing anything with this laptop for 3-4 minutes.  Second, it does freeze quite a bit. Nothing catastrophic, but again- annoying.  So, I guess that's only 2 annoying features. Every other operation is just dandy.  Still, with those two tidbits (number 1 alone), have to give it only two stars.", "Date": "September 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "I'd Skin Them Alive", "Author": "Garret Maxwell", "ReviewID": "R3Q1CSO330RUSN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought one of these 'devices' from a Best Buy because another laptop required repair and I needed it to use a computer immediately for travel.  I will say that Toshiba will not receive business from me again, although it takes two to tango.  In this case, the partner is Windows Vista.If you are a generic user that doesn't need to use the laptop for major use, it may not be that bad.  If you are someone like me who will simultaneously have AutoCAD, Excel, and other software open, don't waste your time.  If I could find the decision makers for this laptop and the fine Microsoft persons who gave the green light to Vista, I would skin them alive and then dip them in vinegar to make up for one tenth of the frustration I've had with this computer.When I restart, the computer has always gone into an endless boot where it looks to start with the hard drive, then goes to the DVD play... and back... and forth... and back... and forth... Enough said there.  The laptop is massively overpowered by that dirty diaper full of programming called Vista.  It is a 64 bit version, so realize when you buy it that A LOT OF YOUR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE WON'T BE ABLE TO RUN ON 64 bit Vista.  As a result of this purchase (here, we step into the Vista diaper deeper), I had to purchase a new printer, a new version of AutoCAD, a new version of Norton Ghost (which eventually won't run anyways), a new portable scanner... and the list goes on and on. My fine new $800 laptop cost me an extra several thousand dollars to run with modified soft/hardware.  You would think that Toshiba would have been prepared for this kind of problem.  Eventually, I paid a kid to swipe the toilet clean ... I mean the laptop, and replace it with Windows 7.  While this does seem to have solved some problems, the laptop is still underpowered.And Toshiba, thanks for putting a Labelflash drive in it.  Unfortunately, although it does a great job, companies like Toshiba never supported it as well as it should have been supported and Labelflash has turned this into the Beta (of VHS versus Beta fame) when compared to Lightscribe.  Again, I like Labelflash BETTER than Lightscribe, so don't get me wrong about that.  It's just that Labelflash is going bye-bye.  BEWARE - Finding Labelflash DVDs is getting tougher and will get expensive.  It does a great job, but the market has collapsed for them...Maybe I got a lemon?  I can't say for sure, but I can say that Toshiba should be ashamed of putting out such a piece of junk.  Microsoft should be ashamed... well, for the last 10 years of garbage they've put out.  I hope you have better luck than I did if you get this 'device'.Skip this machine and look elsewhere and make sure that you never buy a laptop/computer with a dirty diaper (Vista) installed.-M-PS - Strong letter to follow.", "Date": "January 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Laptops ever owned", "Author": "j dizzle \"Jimmy\"", "ReviewID": "R1HMV2DJDPJTBS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The person who gave this a 1 star clearly got a defective unit (can happen to any laptop) I have nothing but good news for this laptop.
