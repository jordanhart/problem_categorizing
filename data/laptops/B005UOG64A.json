{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great computer", "Author": "MGW \"Desert Rat\"", "ReviewID": "R27U6AKAIT0517", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a wonderful used computer.  It is extremely fast.  It has a pleantitude of outlets, USB, VGA, HDMI, SD card, mic, ear, etc. I personally appreciate the incredible processor and the RAM which make it an incredibly fast, versatile laptop.  One of the fun features is the lighted keyboard which turns off after about 20 seconds of nonuse.  As I tend to use my laptop in the evenings this has already been appreciated.  The keyboard itself will take a little getting used to, things on the right are not where they were on my last laptop but the keys themselves are very responsive and tight.  My last laptop was prone to \"ghost\" typing, if you rested your hand anywhere on the wrist rest area it would read as a typing stoke or a mouse movement and I would get some unusual results.  This laptop appears much more sturdily constructed.I cannot say enough good about the seller.  The computer arrived with Windows Vista on it, an operating system I hate with a passion and spent many years cursing as I was forced to use it at work.  Also, the computer was advertised as having Windows 7 on it.  I contacted the seller, sent the computer back and received the reloaded computer with Windows 7 Ultimate on it.  Since it was freshly loaded, I have spent the last two days loading updates on it, but that just tells me it was a new, clean load.  The response time from the seller (who lives on the opposite side of the United States) was remarkable fast, especially as we had a major holiday in the middle of the mailing back and forth.I foresee this being my main computer for the next five years, at least.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great purchase", "Author": "hazem", "ReviewID": "R37WXEP64IHKCS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a hard working machine,not cosmetically great, but the performance is outstanding.I bought a used notebook and it is just fine so far after 9 months.", "Date": "June 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Bad hardware, Bad customer service", "Author": "John H", "ReviewID": "R8KOM2EZRBS5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received this laptop in what appeared to be good condition. The only problem is the screen won't turn on half the time so the thing is totally useless. The seller recommended a software upgrade but that didn't work. I took it to a technician and they say its a hardware problem.The seller is demanding 20% restocking fee plus I pay shipping... That's $90 with nothing to show for it.
