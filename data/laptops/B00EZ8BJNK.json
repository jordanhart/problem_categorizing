Davis", "ReviewID": "R3GORG3JW7SV3C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As I type this review on my new Asus G750JH-DB71 I can only smile.  This is one bad boy notebook.  While serious spec folks will scoff, it has a 7.9 Windows experience rating that means this laptop is at the top of the heap - for desktops.  I am not a professional reviewer, just a hard core PC gamer, so bear with me. First off, the build quality has \"Excellence\" written all over it.  It has the quality feel you would expect for a notebook of this caliber. No excuses, no compromise, just high quality.  The specs are uber-impressive.  All the ram you need, quad core badness and the best video card ever put in a laptop.Gaming: All settings on high, frame rates of about 100 on the FPS games I play.Heat: Incredibly good cooling through giant vents and you can just barely hear the fans kick on when they do.Specs:  Impressive for a gaming desktop, otherworldly for a gaming laptop.Style: While I loved the orange and black paintjob on my old Asus G50-A1, this understated looking laptop won't pop as many eyes when you cart it into the coffee shop, but it is much classier.Sound: This is important!  The sound is the best I've EVER heard from laptop speakers.  I've been used to carrying external speakers with me for movies, but that is no longer necessary. You can watch a movie and have incredibly loud sound with the built in speakers.  The subwoofer is nice too.Screen:  Very nice.  Clear, responsive and no dead pixels or other issues.  Awesome.Downsides:  Windows 8. I installed a program called \"start is back\" on the pc and it looks just like Windows 7 while still keeping the Windows 8 features intact (if you're into that sort of thing).  Only 4 USB ports. Come on laptop manufacturers, how about 6-8 USB ports?  Everyone needs them you know.  Battery life, but who cares?  You can run this thing for about 3 hours unplugged which is pretty good for all the hardware you have packed in.Yeah, this laptop is a little pricey, but for a Gaming Desktop Replacement it's right on the money. LOTS of extra features on this laptop compared to the less expensive models, which your average PC Gamer is going to LOVE!  From the Killer Wireless to the Blu-ray burner to the twin SSD's running in raid and way more.  Boots from cold in 24 seconds and resumes in 2 seconds.  I can't imagine being without this beast - and I'm incredibly glad I bought it.Edit 2/18/2014:  The battery died after the first month and will not charge.  I have contacted Asus support and the tech support person Gloria Yu told me to take it to Best Buy for warranty work.  Best Buy has no idea what she is talking about...they don't do Asus warranty work.  Gloria says I should send the notebook in to them.  Riiight.  It's a battery on a brand new laptop and I'm not sending it to anyone.  Just send me a battery.  \"Oh, well here are some forms to fill out and give us your credit card information and we will send you a battery\".  I filled out the forms they sent me and a month later I am still waiting for a laptop battery.  I have called their so called \"tech support\" several times and they can't seem to help.  \"Just keep re-submitting the same forms, sir\".  Asus, you don't have any business being as big as you are if this is your idea of customer service.  I imagine another company will take their place because this is not the first ill-built Asus product in my home and with customer service like this?  I'd just as soon have Asus for an enemy as a vendor.", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best Desktop Replacement Beast... I feel like Superman + Flash !", "Author": "Rizwan Wangde", "ReviewID": "R2982TQEGX7WFJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a techie by profession. The only reason I wanted this machine was for Photoshop and for setting up multiple Virtual Machines and as my personal testing and training lab. I usually stick to my PlayStation when it comes to Gaming - but not anymore!Firstly, let me share with you the saga of finally deciding to go for this Desktop Replacement Beast. I always wanted a powerful and a fast machine for my work.Your computer is only as fast as the slowest component in it, which is usually the disk!I first had a glimpse of the \"MSI's GT70 Dragon Edition\" which sported a \"Super RAID 2\" configuration which is basically 3 SSDs in RAID 0. I was sure then and there that this was something that will take performance to the next level (I am an Infrastructure related techie). Then there was the new Alienware ALW17, with many different configurations, also sporting an SSD (in RAID 0) config, but at exceptionally high prices (but I was ready to pay the price for the performance). And then there was ASUS G750 series, and the news of it's JH version which was yet to be released.I waited patiently, till I could make a final decision - and what a painful time that was. I did a lot of digging on the MSI and ALW machines and made a pros and cons chart for them vs any of the existing ASUS G750 models at the time (JX). On it's release, I was immediately sold to ASUS G750JH and discarded the ALW17 and MSI GT70. Why?1. I personally find the Stealth Fighter design of Asus much more sexier that ALW17 (100s of LEDs - not worth it) and the MSI (yuck)2. The display on the G750JH is an upgraded version as compared to the JX version, and it scores more than the screens on both ALW17 and MSI GT70.3. The best cooling system as compared to any of the others. Shockingly quiet even when I am playing games like Batman Arkham Origins, Crysis 3 etc.4. Thunderbolt support, Great Sound, Killer\u2122 Wireless-N5. Perfect Value for Money. No nonsense stuff...6. Sexy features - like the extended sleep mode...Basically, you are getting the best of everything in one packed powerhouse. The ALW17 with the same specs was priced over 4000$. WHAAAAAAATTT??? :OI cannot begin to express how fast and smooth the machine is. It's just soooo snappy, I click, and in the next milli second the action is complete. The other day, I was running 3 Virtual Machines (active) in the background, and playing Batman Arkham Origins at the same time. About the VMs, I created the 3 VMs in the same time I would create 1 VM on my older laptop. I am yet to work on Photoshop, but I am sure it will be a breeze...In the end, I cant stop reciting the PROS here, and I am yet to find any CONS. Let me think hard.... 1 min... 5 mins... 10 mins... Nope, None whatsoever!!!Great work ASUS!", "Date": "November 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solid Performer (Updated)", "Author": "Rick", "ReviewID": "R25G6N9QEQDYFR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Having spent a few weeks researching and comparing this model to other GTX 780M equipped machines, I chose this model for the cost. It was less expensive then some of the competition for the included feature set. I read all the reviews here on Amazon and other places before making my decision. I will now share my experiences thus far with the system. This is the G750JH-DB71 non-3D screen (non 120Hz).The machine was sufficiently packaged though I would  probably have preferred it in some soft foam over cardboard to protect it in transit.This machine replaced a ASUS G53SW machine and it is almost an inch longer, and a littler deeper (but it is a larger screen, so expected).The machine is heavy, but this too, was well advertised.The machine ships with Windows 8 and can be upgraded to 8.1 for free at the Microsoft store (which I did, no issues).Screen: The machine's build quality appears ok with no apparent glaring issues from the onset. The screen is bright and clear with no apparent pixel issues. I do notice a tendency toward the cool side on the color temperature in normal settings. I have not noticed the banding others have mentioned yet, but have seen some flickering in certain areas in some programs (notably Amazon Cloud Player, in the dark grey areas).RAM: 24GB of memory is more than enough (overkill for this machine for its intended purpose) so you will not have issues with needing extra memory for a while.Disk: This is my #1 issue with the machine thus far. The RAID-0 mSATA array that the OS is on has a number of partitions on it for various recovery needs and other machine related reasons I am sure. The performance is exceptional. The usable partition on the machine for the C drive is 95GB in size and has only 40 or so remaining after preinstalled software and other things that one may wish to install. The remainder of this RAID-0 256GB chunk of space is assigned to F: and as 121GB free for you to install games or any other items you may wish on the SSD. I have found with Skyrim, Oblivion, and the ME trilogy installed on this volume, there is only 57GB free. This is hardly enough space to hold many more games which all are of significant size. The other installed disk is a 1TB 5400 RPM spindled disk that is partitioned into two 465GB chunks. The performance of this drive is relative to its design and not overly bad considering. I will be replacing it with an SSD in the future.Graphics: Using FRAPS the machine constantly sits at 60FPS in all the games (I installed) except Skyrim where I was between 35-60 depending on scene. I know there are significantly more demanding games then I mention here, but these are my experiences.Keyboard: Backlighting is good, and keyboard feels well constructed and does not flex when typed on (an issue I had with my previous ASUS model). That trackpad is huge and responsive with fairly soft switch activation on the buttons (but they have long travel). The offset arrow keys will be welcome to those who use them frequently.Speakers: The speakers are decent sounding (better than my previous model) but not great. The subwoofer adds some presence, but again, not as rich as some have mentioned in reviews (at least in my experience).Networking: In my testing I was able to mostly saturate my 25Mb/s broadband download speed with the Killer wireless adapter. I could not adequately test the range as I am close to my access point. The Gig Ethernet adapter also worked well and is what I use mostly.Ports: There are 4 USB 3.0 ports which I have all used in my present configuration. The Thunderbolt port drives my 1440P monitor without issue, but performance out to this monitor suffers in frame rates (of what I use, mostly Skyrim). The HDMI port outputs 1080P to an LED TV or monitor and works well. The audio output jack is amplified and can be equalized with the Waves MAXX audio control panel that is preinstalled. The power adapter port is now near the rear and 90 degree angled to not get in the way (as in the old series, it did).Battery: The battery will stay up for a few hours unless you attempt to do something to stress the machine, which without the power adapter attached, is throttled to not exceed the rated CPU speed (2.4GHz). The 780M consumes a lot of power under load and the 230W power brick provides what it needs.The palm rest is nice and the addition of the Assassins Creed logo was not welcomed by many. I too wish it was not there, but I already do not notice it any more.Overall, I am pleased with the purchase which Amazon delivered on time.Why 4 stars only?  The system disk is too small and the odd partitioning will be unwelcome to most of the techie crowd who buy this machine. I will eventually replace both the internal disks with normal SSDs.I will be glad to answer any questions I can on it and follow up with more findings as I discover them though day-to-day use.Hope this helps.Update: 1/27/2014Having had this machine for almost two weeks now, will update.First I replaced the factory 1TB 5400 RPM secondary drive with a Samsung 840 EVO 1TB SSD. That made a significant difference in the overall performance.Getting back to the machine itself, I neglected to mention the cooling system in my initial review. It is indeed as good as indicated in previous reviews and what you may have read elsewhere. The machine is near silent even when stressed on load and temperatures do not get anywhere near high limits.In my earlier comments I made mention of the shimmering I noticed in grey areas of the screen. Upon closer examination, I am seeing that this shimmering is fairly global (across entire screen) when this moderate grey background color is on the screen. For Steam users, it is same as the background on the Steam screen. I am also seeing significant horizontal banding on the display at approximately 1/3\" intervals top to bottom (I read other's reviews of this same issue). This is sadly a real annoying situation (especially the screen shimmer) and I am going to contact ASUS for guidance. Again, I only see these anomalies when the screen is displaying static neutral grey colors. I do not see it on full white or black situations, nor do I notice it during game play (too much activity to notice I think). I am also suspicious about the supposed 140 deg viewing angle, as I can move as little as about a foot off center and the display changes significantly.I will update when I hear from ASUS.Update: 2/17/2014Unit returned from ASUS. They replaced the motherboard and the LCD panel.Result? Does exactly the same thing in the same way as it did before I sent it (which was my fear).I am going to seek assistance from Amazon and possibly return the unit for a refund if they let me.I cannot see spending almost $2500 on a machine that the screen flickers, and has poor banding, etc.I am happy for those that have not experienced any problems. I wish I was one of them.Very dissatisfied.", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great hardware, but Asus sells out to adware and game companies", "Author": "Techie", "ReviewID": "RVEFZVLDJA2WA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using this notebook for about a week and overall I'm satisfied.  Here's my bullet-point review:PROS- Insanely fast, runs everything I've thrown at it very smoothly- It stays cool all the time.  Under regular loads it is also nearly silent and under heavy loads the fan noise is reasonably low.- Easy access to upgrade the hard drive.  I easily tore out the 1TB 5400 mechanical drive and replaced it with a Samsung 840 Evo SSD.- I like to use a mouse with my notebooks and before buying I was concerned that the power input was on the right side of the notebook and that it might interfere with my mouse movements. It turns out this is not an issue, the cable is elevated enough so that it doesn't interfere with using a mouse.CONS- It seems like Asus will let anyone pre-load any kind of nasty adware/spyware on their products for a price.  I had to do a lot of clean up on the hard drive. There was one particularly nasty program that would open a new browser window with all kinds of ads whenever I visited sites like Amazon, eBay, etc.  If I had to do it over again I'd just do a clean Windows install as soon as I got the notebook.  Unfortunately, I had to get this system up and running ASAP and didn't have the time to do a clean Windows installation.- Contrary to the Q&A; on the product description, the notebook I got from Amazon was the Assassin's Creed edition.  I'm not a gamer, but I need the powerful 3D card on this notebook for work-related 3D modeling.  I have no problem with Asus working with a game company to include a game with the notebook, but why on earth would they permanently burn in some random game name on the palmrest?  I've tried removing that game logo with no success.  It seems like nothing short of sand-blasting will make it go away.  At this point I think my only option is to buy a black sticker to cover it up.- Asus splits the twin SSDs that are in Raid 0 into two partitions.  They also split the 1TB into two partitions, so you have a total of 4 logical drives.  That seems an odd choice to me. Fixing this so the twin SSDs are a single logical drive and your secondary drive is also a single logical drive might not be so easy for a novice user to accomplish.", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worth Every $", "Author": "Felipe Guerra", "ReviewID": "R26SUD4SAM4VGO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Build Quality: It has that quality feeling one comes to expect with equipment from the premium tier. It doesn't feel cheap at all. Outstanding.Technical: Impressive for a gaming desktop, otherworldly for a gaming laptop.Sure, there might be desktops that surpass what gaming laptops are capable of but;1) They aren't portable2) You'll have to assemble them yourself (which it's something some people aren't very found of)This desktop replacement, in my opinion has the best specs-price relation among all the options at the time of this writing.Screen: Matte finish makes it totally useable during daylight hours with no discomfort or visual difficulty. In fact I'm sitting next to my window as I type this on the laptop itself and the screen it's really a pleasure for the eyes.Design: It much classier than most gaming laptops, lacking those annoying bright colors, and at the same time it's a show stopper thanks in no small part to it's stealth fighter design and rear vents. It says 'I'm a Gamer/Enthusiast/Hardcore Tech guy/gal, I'm all about performance but I know what style & class means\". Love it.Sound:  is the best I've heard from laptop speakers in ages. The built in speakers totally surprised me with their clear and loud sound (for a laptop). It's worth mentioning that the advertising of the \"Headphone enhancing feature\" on the page is certainly true. The subwoofer is nice addition.Keyboard: \"Isle Kind\" of keys. They are slightly convex which for me make the keyboard a pleasure to type on (in fact I typed all this on it).Downsides:There are some minor things that I don't like. They aren't flaws per se but:1) Odd positioning of the \"home,pgup,pgdn and end\" keys. Is not a big deal at all, but it will take some time to get used to.2) Wish it had different options for the backlighting (like different areas and color schemes) but the one it comes functions flawlessly.3) Odd Partioning scheme: The notebook comes with 2 SSD 128GB in RAID0 Array and 1 TB 5200RPM however the way the portioned the whole thing is... well, it leaves something to be desired.

It looks like a stealth bomber and the hardware flies.  The cooling system is one of the reasons I went with Asus over an Alienware, and it really is top notch, whisper quiet, and very efficient.  The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is sheer volume of bloatware that Asus loaded it up with.If you're a regular user, this thing has the power so that the resources devoted to all these extraneous programs isn't likely to be missed, but you'll want to strip them off if you plan on doing anything resource intensive.  As an aside, if you decided to go the route of a fresh install make sure you note your hardware and driver info first, I had a lot of problems specifically finding the correct wireless card driver and Asus' website wasn't much help.", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "2014 - Review", "Author": "nick", "ReviewID": "R3DEHADW0VETHZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:1.Very fast start up- as it said from the description, this thing will be ready to go within 2 seconds of taking it out of sleep mode, Its maybe about 6 seconds when turning it on.2. easy set up - It pretty much sets itself up for you, you just fill in the blanks for it when you are asked. Id say I was ready to go in under 45 min after taking it out of the box, but downloading all my games added more time :D, also the laptop has a E-manual loaded onto it so you can learn anything you want to know about it and how to use it.3. fast download speeds - My desktop is about 5 years old now and this laptop makes it look like crap when im downloading stuff, when im using steam to download some games im going at about 3.7 MB/S which for me is insane, not sure if that's a lot to other people.4. Good design - by this I mean the physical look of the laptop, the keyboard on this laptop feels great, I can type very fast without stumbling on other keys. Mouse pad is nice but ill never get used to a mouse laptop pad so I just plug in a normal Desktop one.5. The FAN - the fan or even cooling system on this thing is godlike, The fan is very quite when its running. you wont every really notice it when its on. and the laptop itself stays really cool when gaming or when doing other tasks. I cant see this thing overheating unless your overclocking the crap out of it to the point of it breaking.Cons:1. Screen - now for most people this isn't a big deal but its noticeable, the screen compared to most others isn't the best. For gaming its good by all means ( which its really meant for ) but if your watching a DVD on it you can really tell the difference. But this isn't bad. Its fine in all other things. Its nice that it doesn't glare or reflect light but for me, when you play a game that's really, really dark, the screen seem to get even more dark with it to the point that I cant see anything. but when the game lights things up, so does the screen, its kind of strange ( hard to put in words ).2. Battery life - I did buy this laptop knowing it only has a 3 hour battery life span, you can darken the screen and turn off the keyboard lights to save power but this being a gaming laptop it demands a lot of power to run some of the games its meant to play. I find myself always linked to the power cable to keep it going. You just have to keep a good eye on how much Battery you have left. You can get 3 hours if you darken stuff, you can at the most a little over 2 hours if your maxing everything out and have all the lights on bright.Problems: The only real problem I've run into is plugging in my headset/Microphone. I have a 7.1 Razer Meglodon headset that I use and whenever I plug it into one of the 4 USB ports half the time it doesn't see it, and the other half it will say something like it cant tell what I just plugged in. Its pure luck really when it sees it on the laptop now. and when it does see it ill play sound threw it and there will be flickers/ static in the background when audio is playing. Ive reinstalled the audio drivers and everything but still nothing has changed. I think there might be a Driver problem or motherboard problem on this laptop, Which is a shame. I have contacted customer support to resolve this so I will update this review after its all settled.( let it be known my headset does work fine on my desktop, I switched between the 2 to see if it was the Headsets fault but it wasn't, this is just a problem with the laptop )Recommend:Id recommend this to people even though the problem above has been annoying in know its just the problem with my machine and not all of them. so I would tell anyone who moves around a lot but loves to game to buy this, its a best of a laptop and I am glad I got it. even if I have to get it replaced, lol.other comments:1. Windows 8 / 8.1 - I don't see the big deal with windows 8, a lot of people seem to hate it ALOT but I had no problem at all learning it or using it. Not sure the difference from Windows 7 because I came from a Vista System so maybe the learning gap isn't as big but I overall found it simple to use and easy to find what I was looking for. I only wish Microsoft would stop shoving Internet Explore,Bing and Xbox live in my face when I use the interface. I get they want me to use it but my god there is a limit.2. Weight - Other people complained about the 10-11 pounds this thing weighs and its not as bad as some people make it seem. I mean if you cant hold on to 10 pounds then that's a personal thing. I think its rather light for me and this being a gaming laptop it should be expected to be heavier then normal Notebooks. it just comes with the power it brings.Conclusion:Overall the Pros out way the Cons for me and I do enjoy this laptop and will be showing it off to my buds for months(maybe years) to come :)Also id give this a 5/5 if it wasn't for the one problem I had, if it gets fixed or if I get a replacement without this problem then I will change it.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Recommended", "Author": "steven s\u00e1nchez marin", "ReviewID": "R2CRACG4JC8U81", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Really nice design, really quick and stable system, and most important: not overheating!!!

They asked for the model, I told them the G750JH (top of the G750 line when I bought it) and they told me it is 3D capable.  A little later they asked for the serial number which I provided and after a very long pause they came back and said that my model does not have the 3D capable screen. They were very sorry but I had a model that was not a 3D model screen.  On the Asus web site it clearly stated \"New NVIDIA\u00ae GeForce\u00ae GTX discrete graphics have the muscle to pump out amazing visuals in even the most demanding games, put up on a full HD 1080p screen.

The reseller just copies the spec data that the manufacturer provides so they are in the same situation reading through the specifications..

I love the matte screen as its less likely to attract finger prints and doesn't reflect light like a glossy screen would.The keyboard is very accurate and is great for typing or playing games (Duh) which is expected with any gaming laptop. The keyboard lights up white as well. Sadly you can not change colors, but can adjust the brightness using your keyboard. The backlit keyboard also helps at night as the letters will glow so you can see what keys to press. Overall very nice and probably the best keyboard I have ever used.The performance of this laptop is very fast. Like I said earlier it's comparable to a desktop. Equip with the latest Intel Core I7 processor and NVidia graphics card it can easily play any game on high settings as of January, 2014. If you didn't already know the CPU starts at 2.4GHz and goes up to 3.4GHz when needed. Its loaded with 24GBs of RAM and the graphics card is the 780m with 4GB GDDR5 RAM which is the best available graphics card from NVidia for laptops. The hard drive is also very fast as it uses a 128GBx2 solid state drive enabled in Raid 0.  In case you use up your storage you still have another TB (1,000 GB's) of information you can store on your D: drive.The killer wireless works well too. I tried downloading a game. Through wireless I got 1 MB - 1.5 MB per second while downloading the game. With Ethernet I got 1.5 MB - 2.1MB per second. Could be better, but it still pretty fast. My internet connection is around 15MB's download speed.The cooling system is excellent as well. I can barely hear it when doing normal tasks. If the CPU or GPU starts to heat up the fan gets faster as it needs to, but even then its still pretty quiet. I guess you really only notice it if you're in a dead silent room.ConsNot sure if this was for everyone or just me, but when I first used the laptop the 2 USB ports on the top left side were kind of difficult to use. When I tried plugging something in it had a lot of resistance and was difficult to plugin. When I tried plugging in my headset to the USB port it said the device had malfunctioned. Now after a few uses it works fine now and there's little to no resistance.Although I do enjoy the solid state drive and the extra TB of hard drive I did not like how ASUS partition the hard drive multiple times. Really annoying when I tried download Battlefield 4 and it said I had ran out of room. I had since recombined the D: drive to 1 TB and recombined the C: drive to 256GB. Although I had to download the miniTool partition wizard for the C: drive since it wouldn't expand due to a recovery section separating them. But the problem is now fixed so I guess its ok.The Assassin's Creed IV - Black Flag logo was a really stupid idea. I don't know who came up with this but the JH model comes with this even though you can't see it in the photo's for this laptop. Its right under the arrow keys in big white letters. Now it's not that I don't like the game its just that I really don't want a clear PERMANENT logo of a game on my $2,300+ laptop.

Acevedo II", "ReviewID": "R5KLSS5F039OD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the ASUS G73SW-A2 Republic of Gamers 17.3-Inch Gaming Laptop back on 2011.Since then, it has been pretty much flawless.  I also had at the time, a high end Sony Vaio Laptop, high end HP Laptop and an HP Desktop.  Only the HP Labtop is running; the Vaio stopped working when there was electrical issues (I liked my Vaio) and the Desktop just died (But who cares).  I'm  replacing them both with with my 2011 ROG and getting this new G750JH for X-Mas.  I know it will last for years as my current G73SW is running strong heading into 2014.I will update perodically on the new G750JH as I receive it and put it through the usual gauntlet of applications. This is an actual review by an actual owner, not an Asus implant.  The G750JH is right on the mark in product, price and power.  Don't get confused with other laptops claiming to perform as well, only to have your money taken from you.  It would be like fighting a raging volcano with a water hose to get your money back.  If you are in the market for a laptop and have the money, don't delay, get the ROG today before they are gone (My HP Laptop was just that -$1,500.00 POOF)!  If you know much about laptops, you will definately see and feel the real power this Asus G750JH has.  Don't sweat the Assasins Creed stuff, it's the power you want, not the logo!P.S., I'm no fan of Windows 8 but will not hold my ROG accountable for that.  Till my next post Happy Holidays!  ***UPDATE 17DEC13***K, the shipping was aweful.  Amazon requested a signature but did not let me know and UPS was no help.  Had to wait 4 extra days to get this even though I paid for next day shipping.  Be sure to verify through Amazon the shipping method or be ready for a delay.  ROG is still in it's packaging since I had no time to open it up and inspect it.  Will keep you posted!  ***UPDATE 25DEC***Merry Christmas.  This laptop is one silent but deadly system. Windows 8 blows and adjustments have to be made to get use to it.  Now the ASUS, yes this beast ASUS is A W E S O M E !  First, you would not even know it was on if it wasn't for the lights.  It is very silent. The power is right below your keyboard or mouse buttons.  This ROG is on roids.  The one down side is the offset directional keys.  They seem to get in the way of traditional QWERTY style typing, but if your a chicken pecker, then no worries.  Love this thing.  The screen is nice and the layout (minus directional keys) is easy to work with.  I am using a Madcatz RAT 9 Wireless and it works flawless with this laptop.  Get 'em while they last because this system is there for the taking.  Will keep ya posted!", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Came back from warrantee hardware repair with software problem.

I researched extensively before buying and found that this one, while a little more expensive, had fewer problems than anything comparable. In fact, I have not personally had any problems with it. It easily handles normal tasks such as web browsing and word processing, so well that it feels like I never have to wait for anything to load. This also extends to startup and restart, which used to induce a thousand yard stare as I waited on my old computer, but now I barely blink and it's ready to go (slight exaggeration but not by much). Using AC4, a free download with the computer, I did some testing on the performance using MSI Afterburner and found that with all settings maxed out, this computer was able to run at around 60 fps, although the frame rate did drop to around 30 fps during more intensive moments. Other games that I have played that are a bit older run with a blazing frame rate such as Far Cry 2 at 110-120 fps with everything maxed. The construction is very nice and solid. There is no creaking of the chassis and overall it feels very solid. The keyboard feels great, whether for playing or typing, it is solid and responsive. The nonreflective screen is fantastic and looks great, glossy screens drive me crazy. The track pad is nicely responsive and works well with the Windows 8 functions. There are only a few drawbacks or things to look out for. First are the size and weight. It is a huge computer that weighs a ton. I'm a pretty big guy and actually like the size, but my wife has trouble with using or moving it comfortably. Also, the power brick is just that. I had to buy a new book bag in order to accommodate my new computer, but am extremely content with both. The final concern are the fan intakes. Asus has made a great cooling system with two fans, each with their own intake and output. However, the intake for each fan, they are symmetrically arranged on the back end, is on the bottom of the back side. On a table or any other hard surface this will not be an issue, but if used on a bed etc, then the intakes could be blocked and the GPU can increase in temperature mighty quick with graphics intensive games or applications. A lap pad would completely fix this issue though. Altogether, I highly recommend and hope to enjoy this PC for a long time.", "Date": "February 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "LOVE LOVE LOVE", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3SU04A8D1STCP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hubby and I were looking for a gaming laptop for me and this surpassed what we were looking for.
