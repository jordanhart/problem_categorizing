{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Budget Computer", "Author": "Hermes F. Rivera", "ReviewID": "RBP2VTX96RREN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Being a computer technician for the last 15 years, I am very picky when it comes to buying computers, especially laptops and even more special, laptops with Celeron CPUs. This is my very first Celeron laptop and I have to tell you that I am surprised and amazed at the performance of this particular Celeron. Todays Celeron CPUs are NOT the Celeron CPUs of 10 years ago. These new Celeron 900 are based on Core 2 Duo CPUs. They are exactly the same except for 2 things: They have 25% less Cache than their Core 2 Duo counterpart and they are single core, but that doesn't mean it's slow by any means. This laptop came with 2GB of RAM (I upgraded it to the full 4GB), a 15.6\" HD LCD Screen, a 250GB Hard Drive running at 7200 RPM - yes you are reading right - 7200 RPM! - Most laptops out there have a 5400 RPM HD, including the more expensive models, so this is a real bonus. It comes with B, G, and N Wireless, Intel 4500 Graphics, 2 USB Ports and a DVD Writer.The performance of this laptop is quite good. Very fast booting up. Windows open smoothly. Tasks are handled quite well, even with 2GB of RAM. The 4GB of RAM makes things even better. The Celeron 900 2.2 GHz CPU inside packs quite a punch. Take a look at this benchmark:[...]It is by no means a weak processor. Overall this is a great laptop for $329.00 (BestBuy). Much better than a Netbook for sure (since that is what I was going to buy in the first place). Netbooks have no CD or DVD units, only 1GB of RAM, Slow Atom CPUs and 8 to 10 inch screens and cost over $350.00 (a good one). This laptop simply beats the netbooks in price, power and features. You will not be able to do serious video editing or play online games like Unreal Tournament 3, Crysis or things like that because of the limited video card, but hey let's get real, who uses a laptop to play games anyways? That's what desktops are for. If you are going to be mobile (traveling), going to school or simply work at the office then this is the perfect machine for you. If you are into web surfing, email and Microsoft Office and on a budget then look no further. For the price, you are getting a quality built machine with everything you need to do. All that and a little more. The components inside (motherboard and chipset) are all made by Intel.I highly recommend it.", "Date": "January 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Budget PC", "Author": "hipslap", "ReviewID": "RNQ1GE3MAEARN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This computer is great if your looking for an extremely cheap, full-sized laptop.  I had my doubts about the Celeron processor but they were unfounded.  The processor opens and closes programs quickly, boots up fast and runs multiple applications at once with no problems or lag. I find 2gb of ram to be the sweet spot when it comes to ram.  Unless I'm doing any sort of rendering I'll never max out my ram even with all of my programs open.  It is nice to know I can upgrade to 4gb of ram if need be, however. All in all, I could not be happier with the performance of this computer.Performance aside there are some things about the laptop that I dislike.  The most annoying thing to me is the lack of dedicated volume control buttons.  I need to press the \"fn\" key along with \"+\", \"-\" or \"*\" to control volume up, volume down and mute.  The computer also comes loaded with pre-installed programs so be prepared to spend some time uninstalling them. Personally, I also wish the resolution of the display was higher. 1366x768 is ok but I think 1440x900 is perfect for a computer this size.  The plastics of the computer are nothing to write home about either.  Generally, the finish of the computer feels as you would expect for the price... cheap.There are obviously going to be some drawbacks for a computer this inexpensive.  Even with everything I dislike about this computer I still think its a great value and would recommend it to anyone shopping for a laptop on a budget.  Being the least expensive full-sized notebook I could find, I would go as far ad to say the power and features of this computer are remarkable.", "Date": "February 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Better than most people will tell you.", "Author": "Aaron Coleman \"AC\"", "ReviewID": "R1EPG8RYQOJJNH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've always been picky when it comes to computers.

Almost 4 and a half months later I regret nothing.At some point during my college career - either my Sophmore or Junior year, which means 2000 or 2001 - I purchased my first laptop, a Dell. I used it for a number of years, but one day it just wouldn't start back up. Ever since then I've purchased HP desktop computers, and while I've helped others purchase laptops, and have thought about buying one, the price for the machine I wanted to build just wasn't in line with what I wanted to pay. So instead I'd purchase a nicely built desktop, for a fraction of the price.After goofing around with some other portable PC options, and debating whether to buy an iPod Touch, I finally settled on picking up this laptop. I trust HP to put together well-built, and dependable machines; three desktops of varying ages, still all working today. I wasn't sure about their Compaq line, but at the beginning of this month, based on this laptop, I picked up a low-cost Compaq desktop, and would do it again in the future. And a co-worker purchased this same computer a few months earlier, and when asked, said he still found it to be a good buy (and this is actually what pushed me over the edge).I won't speak too much about what the machine contains, since that's well covered in the specs. Instead, I'll tell you how I use it and what I've done to it, with notes as needed for what I've found to be issues.There's not too much junk installed on the machine, so no issues there; maybe 3 or 4 hours to get those uninstalled, backup discs made, and Windows Updates applied.While the 2 GB of RAM is okay, since this is a 64-bit machine I purchased 2 2GB sticks (from Crucial) for around $120, with shipping. It's unfortunate that it comes with two 1 GB sticks, but ... I did this 2 and a half months after I purchased the machine, so clearly it's more of a personal choice (I do Web development and wanted to be able to run various systems on VirtualBox).I've debated following the advice of another reviewer and swapping in a more powerful video card (Windows experience is 3.3 because of it, although Windows 7 starts up and runs fine), but with the Web surfing (handles Flash-heavy sites fine, as well as Netflix streaming) and development (mostly in Visual Studio 2010; have run Windows XP and Windows Server 2008 on VirtualBox) that I do on the machine, I haven't felt the need. (Office 2010 also handles well.)Wireless (B/G/N) has worked great, although I've had to manually turn it off and back on twice after it lost my signal, which is amazingly simple. (A third time I ended up powercycling my router, so I assume there were larger issues.)The left mouse button does seem a little unresponsive at times (3 or 4 times), but if nothing else, there's always USB mice, which I've taken to using when I'm at home, which is where this computer gets most of it's use, as I've shut down one of my desktop machines that I always had up and running for surfing and etcetera.Almost every day I lug the machine to work and pull it out during lunch to work on one thing or another. I purchased an HP EZ141AA Nylon Value Case, and while at first it seemed like it was going to be too small, it actually works really well. I highly recommend this bag, but if want to lug a number of other items within it, you probably want to look for something larger.Overall, I give this computer 5 of 5 stars and recommend it highly (and have to my sister and another co-worker).", "Date": "June 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "decent low-budget laptop", "Author": "Harold George Wagner III \"The Professor\"", "ReviewID": "R2CY73U77GMPGO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would probably give this a higher rating, if the battery life was a bit longer. But at 2 hrs and 15 minutes, that is sufficient enough for me to get through a class without my battery dying on me. Other times, I can plug it in and not risk the laptop turning off. It is nice to have wifi, though when I used it sometimes it was sporadic (this could just be an issue with my university's wifi). I was not thrilled to see Windows 7 64 bit, but most programs run just fine. The only downside is a lack of 16-bit program support. I absolutely love the integrated touchpad (not just a separate piece of plastic) and the speakers are decent. Sometimes flash based online applications can make the processor jump to 100% but I don't use a lot of those (only once in a while) so that won't be a major problem. The laptop can smudge easily so be careful and don't touch it with sweaty palms. The on/off for the touchpad is great, so I can wipe it off or watch a movie without accidentally interrupting the mouse. The wifi on/off is also nice, though I haven't seen a change in battery consumption (yet). I would recommend this laptop to all college students (like myself) with a limited budget who just need a computer to take to classes or something. Yes, it is somewhat of a \"bare bones\" laptop (no HDMI, TV input, etc) but no bells or whistles needed for this college student, and by the way, the \"CQ\" Compaq logo on the lid looks pretty boss, too.", "Date": "February 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great for low budget PC's not for use with heavy resource software", "Author": "G. G. Soto \"G. Gonzalez\"", "ReviewID": "RHV6827UPNAXL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this computer almost a year and a half ago. Since then, I've had to get the battery and the cooling fan replaced. I will not lie, it is a good computer for a price of 329.99 but I would not pay more than 350.00 dlls for it, also HP support (since they now own Compaq) was great and helped me with the issues mentioned before.I am however sad to say that it will struggle with some video applications, the battery life will drop dramatically in performance within 8 months and the lid will start to become very flimsy after six months of daily opening and closing.With the applications, I had issues with Quick-time and the video plug ins for IE, Firefox and Safari. I could not get it to work that well with Hulu but I think the blame should fall equally on their side and HP.With the battery, I had it replaced after 6 months of use because it would not last more than 30 minutes in the last month of use (only web surfing, no video or applications). HP sent me a replacement rather quickly and issue solved for the next 8 months, now the battery is good for only an hour and twenty minutes on easy use.With the Lid and the cooling fan. The lid will become flimsy rather quickly but it is not a big issue, I can live with that. The cooling fan however, is a big issue. They had to replace it because it stopped working one day and it would not turn on, I used an application called \"HDD health\" that gave the temperature for both the Hard Drive and the system, the HD was 66 Celsius and the system was 82 Celsius. The replacement did not helped that much it measures around 65 dB to 88dB of noise and the temperature will be sometimes 62 Celsius and the system will not drop from 75 Celsius.I would recommend to purchase this computer for very low processing applications and not for day to day used. It is not a traveler's companion as it starts to fell very heavy when carrying it around airports and college campuses. Also, I recommend buying the extended warranty and hopefully it still includes the battery replacement.

The Gateway battery was much smaller and lighter and gave me an honest 4 hours in the same type of usage.Also, the supplied AC adapter gets very hot when the unit is charging. Compaq sent a new one under warranty, but it too gets very hot.  My Gateway adapter never even got warm to the touch. I'm afraid to leave it plugged in unattended.

We have it for about 18 months and do not have any problem until recently it died. The O/S does not even start. Anyway, the laptop is well-made. The screen size is right for us. The battery life outlasted any other laptops we had. Unlike Vista, Window 7 works well with the hardware configuration and the performance is responsive. It connects to the wireless router on a fly (in a couple of seconds). We encountered no lags whether surfing on the web, editing document or watching movie. The stereo sound from the speakers is clear. The graphic is sharp. Overall, I reduced it from 5 stars to 2 stars because it could not last long enough. 18 months is too short.

So I go through a laptop about every year due to failure (Toshiba) or preventable damage (Sony).  I have moved away from the more expensive laptops due to not wanting to worry about being too rough on the thing.  Last year I decided to switch manufactures and try HP, again.  I had been using various Sony and Toshiba laptops in the six years since I had last owned an HP, which was also a Presario and nothing but problems.I chose the 615DX after doing a little research and determining that this was the best bang for the buck that would also fit my needs.  I am not a gamer, engineer, or rocket scientist, so I certainly didn't need a $1000+ laptop to simultaneously render streaming X-Files episodes while I play Warcraft with my internet friends.  The 615DX has been an excellent laptop.The video is solid for watching movies and television; the wide screen is great.  However, the video output is a little under powered to run to an external monitor or television for running split screen or whatever.  I have done limited video editing on it and haven't noticed any serious lag time.The touch pad is very user friendly.  I am not sure how I feel about the full keyboard (it has a number pad), but it is not a bad thing.  There isn't a storage device card reader, but I picked up a multi-card reader for about $5 that plugs into one of the three usb ports. Could use a volume interface.Battery life could be better.

So this is from a novice. The good: Price, seems to be fast, LAN works real good, love the touchpad (after I \"fixed\" it), fast battery charge, Windows 7. Not so good: low speaker volume, touchpad \"tapping\" feature was turned on, black keys, Windows 7. Bought this from a local dept store; going for two weeks now, no real issues. Seems to be as fast or faster than my old desktop pc. I thought the touchpad was defective because it kept selecting things without me clicking on them. Almost returned it; did a little research (read the so-called manual). Discovered that the \"Tapping\" feature was on by default. I had never heard of the tapping feature (first laptop remember;). Turned it off and was very happy that I didn't have to return it. I like the metal-smooth finish of the touchpad, my finger tip slides smoothly on it. Had my old Norton Antivirus account transferred in less than 5 minutes online (someone here said it took 3 hours????). Wireless Lan connected on first boot in a minute or less and has been perfect ever since. The speaker volume is somewhat limited; some movies have insufficient volume unless you use an earphone. I hate black keys on a laptop. They can't be easily seen in dim light, but that is true for most I guess. I'm a control freak and had to learn a lot of patience with Windows 7; which wants to control every aspect of the pc. Every software package over 3 years old needed considerable research to take care of any custom setup or compatibility. Get used to frequently shouting \"Give me the damn permissions!!!\".

Until July of 2012 it was my primary computer.It worked well for basic tasks (web browsing using Chrome, including fairly heavy YouTube use), as well as some more complex things (programming LEGO robots; downloading via USB or Bluetooth w/ a dongle), but after a time it became extremely slow when gaming, especially playing Minecraft (this might be a problem with Windows/the usual progress of things; it ran better under Ubuntu on the same hardware).  I was at one point able to play Portal; it never really ran Portal 2 all that well.Unfortunately I was stupid and left it plugged in all the time; as a result, the battery now lasts far less time than it did when it was new.  This would not be much of a problem as when this became a reality I used it mainly as a desktop and could keep it plugged it in.  However, the power plug (the part inside the laptop itself) went a bit wonky around 8 months into its life.  The laptop can still be charged, but the plug has to be twisted a bit until it begins charging.  This is a pain when the battery dies completely; I've spent 10-20 mins trying to get it to boot with a dead battery.As an aside, I discovered when troubleshooting the above problem that the laptop will charge just fine using the power adapter shipping with most (all?) Dell laptops form the last 5-6 years.  Looking at the brick, the Dell adapter is providing a volt less power, but I've used Dell adapters several times with no ill effects.After about a year of using it fairly frequently with headphones/external speakers, one of the screws holding in the sound card broke.  Due to the way it is attached, this meant that when I tried to plug anything into the headphone jack the entire sound card pushed into the chassis.  Needless to say, this was extremely inconvenient.  Eventually (a couple of weeks ago) I fixed this my taking the machine apart (extremely complex, not for the faint of heart) and fixed it by taping the sound card back in place with electrical tape.  The tape is partially visible from the outside but only on the black plastic, so you barely notice it.Other hardware comments:  *The trackpad is horrible at worst, usable at best.  If the laptop gets hot (which it will), there is so much friction between the trackpad's surface (which is the same as the rest of the computer below the keyboard, just recessed) and your finger is unusable.  It's also centered under the QWERTY part of the keyboard, not the whole thing, which I find aesthetically weird but makes some sense.  *The keyboard was fine for me, but it's a keyboard, so your mileage may vary.  It has a full sized number pad, which I like.  *The trackpad can be disabled with a button between it and the keyboard. which is useful if you are watching a movie or are using an external mouse.  *The VGA port doesn't have the holes to screw the cable in, which saves space but can sometimes be annoying.  *There is a plugged up, suspiciously HDMI-shaped hole on the left hand side.  Further research confirms that other CQ60 models come with HDMI.  This never made a difference for me but might for other people.In July of 2012 I supplemented this computer with a 6-year-old MacBook.  The COmpaq is now relegated to desktop use/Win8 testing/general Windows machine/Microsoft Flight Simulator.  I swapped the RAM with the 1GB of RAM in the Mac; it seems to run relatively smoothly even with half the RAM.Currently it is dual-booting Windows 7 Home Premium (which it shipped with) and Windows 8 release preview.

I don't use a smart phone, don't do social networking and have no use for a webcam. What I need is mobile version of my office and home desktop. And this Compaq has performed flawlessly. My home desktop is also a Compaq with more power. But it's a little hard to sit in Mickey D's and eat breakfast with a desktop. I could probably use a net book but why? The greater functionality and larger screen size (easy on these old eyes) for the same price makes a net book a questionable purchase.I can't say much more. It works well and has performed very well for me for almost 2 years. For only $350 bucks, to me that's value.I do have one bad thing to say - Windows 7. But reverting bad to XP like I have done with my desktops, even though Compaq makes that a pretty easy task. Just isn't really worth the effort here.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Truely Unhappy", "Author": "SilentStarzzz", "ReviewID": "R3SITXO4P4LTF4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Right out of the gate when I recieved the package the box was crushed. I looked somewhate like an accordian even though it was marked FRAGILE all over the box. Once I opened the box and saw the laptop I was further disappointed that the \"very good\" condition was incorrect. Dirty keys plus multiple dents and dings. I was also disappointed that there was no anti virus software at all. The machine is very slow and the wireless adapter is junk it constantly says I am not connected to the internet when I AM. I have to reset it multiple times before it will even attempt to connect to my wi-fi.

If your picky about the features like I am. Then this computer probably isn't for you. Yes, it does have the DVD/CD burner on it like I wanted. But it didn't not have the HDMI output, or the Lightscribe on it. It runs fast and smoothly. But I don't know if it's my battery or what but the power on just the battery itself runs for about an hour in a half. While others can make it last two hours. This is a disappointment to me as I travel quite a bit with the family and it's always nice to be able to go goof around on the Internet with my Wireless Internet Card from U.S. Cellular. The little scrollbar on the touchpad does drive me a little crazy as I sometimes accidentally hit it and it scrolls my window either up or down but all in all a good quality computer. I am also a gamer on this computer and it plays all my CD-ROM games great(like Guitar Hero 3, Frets on Fire, Lord of The Rings, etc.). If you want to make sure it has Microsoft Office on it and you buy it from Best Buy(like I did) be sure to pay the extra $50 for it(unlike what I did) otherwise, all you get is just a 60-day trial.", "Date": "November 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "HP Compaq Presario CQ60-615DX Notebook", "Author": "RZ", "ReviewID": "R9SPMRBH6H2EA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just bought this and I am very happy with it. the processor is not that bad, its faster then my old laptop so I am pleased.", "Date": "July 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "My second one.", "Author": "Ojetta Scott", "ReviewID": "R2GUKMUOCM1Y44", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this Compaq Notebook for my daughter.

The salesman immediately tried to up-sell me by citing the reputation of the Celeron processor for being slow, but with their 14-day return policy I figured I had nothing to lose and held my ground.  Let me tell you that this IS NOT your fathers old Celeron processor and only runs warm if you block the vents. (A board or an $18 laptop \"desk\" works great.) It is plenty fast, and it's 2mb of ram is sufficient for most applications.  Battery life could be better as I get about 2 hours which may limit it as a truly portable machine, but I found that I'm plugged in probably 95% of the time anyway.  My 4 year old Gateway desktop with it's 2gHz AMD dual-core processor, 2mb ram, and Win XP is so slooooow by comparison, and now sits idle.  I've spent $2000 on laptops a couple of times, and hopefully never will again.
