{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Deal! Good laptop!", "Author": "Musicfan \"Alexis\"", "ReviewID": "RI6PVCYBG99SV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I needed a new laptop after the hard drive on my 3 year old Dell laptop crashed a few months ago. Because I am a college student, I wanted a smaller computer to carry around campus or use comfortably outside of my room. The 14'' screen is a  widescreen and is excellent for viewing pictures, videos, and movies. My old computer had a 15.5'' screen. I prefer a larger screen, but the bigger the screen, oftentimes, the heavier the laptop. This computer weighs about 5 lbs with the battery (without it, it is obviously much lighter), but it feels like it weighs much less. The keyboard is also a good size and the keys are not raised, so food, dust, and hair are less likely to get caught in the keyboard. I own this computer in black and the photos are true to real life. Orginally, I wanted this laptop in white, but decided against that because it would get dirty very quickly. The computer uses Windows 7. My old one had Vista, so I'm still getting used to Windows 7's new features. I've had this for almost a week and it is very easy to use.PROS:Screen sizeKeyboardMemory (4GB included. Very fast! I can listen to music, be on the Internet, and run other programs without the computer slowing down)Hard Drive (640GB is more than enough space for me and the overall price is great.)WeightCONS:The lid is not fingerprint proof. Even in black, fingerprints are still visble. Not a big deal to me.The mouse is a little unrespnsive at times and the touchpad isn't very smooth. Not a deal breaker, however.No recovery software included.*Make sure to backup your files often on an external hard drive or CDs and make a recovery disc (instructions are provided). The computer does not have any discs containing the OS software or recovery information. *", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Laptop I've had so far...", "Author": "N. Senman \"NS\"", "ReviewID": "R1O82EAKKXCX97", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop for $499.00 at PC Richard. It was the last one they had and was originally $699.00 and marked down so I said I can't beat this price anywhere for this model so I purchased it. I like the look, even though it is all plastic and I am not a fan of all plastic laptops I still think it is one of the best constructed ones I've seen. The ASUS are pretty good too. The keyboard is nice with the chicklet style which is pretty popular these days. The keyboard is attractive and I like the laptops simplicity in design. Vaios are always know for being pretty cool looking. I upgraded the RAM from 4GB to 8GB and now this thing is blazing fast. It gets a Windows Experience Index of 4.7 overall within which is based on the lowest score which is the graphics but the rating says it can use up to 1.6 GB of video memory which is pretty good. The Processing speed is at 6.7, and the RAM is 7.2, so overall this laptop is fast for the price you pay. I don't care too much for Home Premium Edition but at least it comes with 64bit. I may redo the hard drive with Windows Ultimate 64bit version. Here is my list of pros and cons...Pros: Good processor speed, works fast with 4GB and 8GB RAM, Good stylish design, HD graphics, Good screen resolution, nice keyboard, expansion slots, 4 usb ports, DVD RW, good battery life.Cons: Touchpad can be quirky at times, Windows home premium---would prefer Pro or Ultimate, plastic. Changed to Windows 7 Ultimate...it was well worth it.Overall, I am glad I bought it. It satisfies me, and works well for what I do. I mainly do word processing, video, and browsing the net. Not really into laptop gaming, I've got a desktop for that and the Sony PS3.Thanks", "Date": "June 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Laptop", "Author": "Jillian R.

Considering I bought mine at Best Buy for $320.00 and it runs very smooth!  I to have issues with the mouse pad, but once I plug in my travel mouse which I prefer anyway everything is fine! I installed Norton 360 and have not had any issues with performance.  Great laptop for the price considering most Sony's are astronomical.

Makes my life easier, have had some quirks like the mouse jumping around on the screen occasionally just like I read in other reviews. I worried about that but it's really not that big of a deal. I also wanted to avoid Windows 8 and Windows 7 has had good reviews compared to Vista and 8. When I went to college for computer information technology the rule of thumb was that every other operating system by Microsoft is the good one. So since Vista had quite a few issues, seven was the way to go. This little laptop offers room to upgrade to the next good OS so it should last me a long time.", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Anonymous", "Author": "Anonymous", "ReviewID": "R3NR3E27G3QC5H", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "A week after i had bought this laptop, it started to give me a hard time. It would slow down and freeze and I would have to restart it alot. I had to call Sony vaio Care a couple of times to fix it for me. So i did system restore and system recovery on it a few times. Even after all this, it would be okay for a while and then go back to its annoying ways. So i was basically going back and forth between the laptop giving me a hard time and me restarting it or calling Sony Vaio.

It's Sony and you pay the brand name.Overall it's a good laptop and in a difficult color for find but with this price you can buy a better hp, asus, toshiba laptop.Compre esta laptop para mi novia que es fanatica del color rosado, le encanto el dise\u00f1o texturizado y el color rosa suave.Realmente el equipo esta hecho con buenos materiales y en un dise\u00f1o muy bonito pero es lo minimo que se podria esperar por el precio tan alto.Funciona bien con windows 7 y no tiene problemas de lentitud, tampoco se tranca realizando multiples tareas con programas de musica, video, navegacion, office, etc. Aun asi por el precio uno esperaria mas beneficios o un mejor desempe\u00f1o pero realmente es cara por ser Sony, asi que si quieres una laptop de alto rendimiento, puedes buscar en otras marcas que ofrecen opciones mas economicas y similares a esta o mejores.Solamente la compramos por el color rosado, que es dificil de encontrar y menos a buen precio, siempre es caro en todas las marcas.", "Date": "July 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great but Risky", "Author": "court", "ReviewID": "R3ER1VDH403EU8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I absolutely loved this laptop. My style and seemed very nice. Im not the kind of person to return everything I get, and Im not picky. But unfortunetly, I am returning this laptop. It was very weird. I was using it one day just fine never gave me any problems, but I packed it up and when I got home it would not turn on or anything. A half hour later it finally turns on and is just fine again. The battery life on it is excellent so that wasn't an issue but I did even try plugging it in. I've only had it for 25 days and I haven't paid anything on it because I charged it. This little episode just scared me and everyone I talked to said I should return it because it should not do that.

I worked with Sony reistalling the driver a couple of times, but the problem kept returning. The keys were not backlit and I did not think to check for a back light before I purchased it.
