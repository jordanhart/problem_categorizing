Pauler", "ReviewID": "R1FU8ABQQNONN2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got mine at Best Buy for $530 and consider that a great price for an i5 2.6GHz processor and 6GB of RAM, plus a touch screen. I was a bit surprised to hear that Cnet considers this a \"thick\" and \"old looking\" laptop - maybe for a grand you can buy one that is thinner and \"newer looking\", but for $530 I didn't see anything that would match it.Anyway, here is the good:Screen picture quality: 1600X900 on a 14 inch screen equals pretty amazing high-def stuff.Speed: running IE, Chrome and Office 2013 (I am not into gaming, so don't know how that would work or not)WiDi - wireless screen sharing (with compatible devices).Build qualityNot so good:Touch screen not responsive to gentle touches, you have to poke it pretty hard some times (don't have much to compare this to besides a smart phone).Keyboard is a bit cramped if you are used to full size keyboards, but you get used to it.Strange keyboard issue when USB mouse is plugged in - CTRL key \"sticks\" (not physically but in software), so as you type it acts as if CTRL is pressed all the time (typing an \"i\" turns everything italic, and so on).For $530 I thought it was a great deal, and has worked out pretty good so far :).", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Almost, but not Quite", "Author": "Tim Gill", "ReviewID": "R3V0AK0RX74ZHV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After my Sony laptop was stolen, I embarked on a search for an affordable ultrabook or near-ultrabook style laptop. This was on sale at Best Buy for about $540 plus tax, and I thought I'd take a chance on it, but things didn't work out.The Good:- Great screen for a machine in in this price range. 1600 x 900 resolution, and fairly good (not amazing) color saturation. Touch is fairly responsive, though single-taps require a fairly forceful touch.- Backlit keyboard is nice, even though the keyboard has shortcomings; more below.- Nice feature set/specs for a machine in this price range. i5 processor, 6GB Ram, 500GB Hard drive with a 24GB SSD for booting.- Boots quickly and is fairly snappy, thanks to the SSD.- Lots of ports.- Design, while cumbersome and thick (more below), feels sturdy and nearly indestructible, as long as you can live with the weight...- DVD/CD drive is a nice feature.The Bad:- HEAVY. A laptop in this size range feels like a brick at 5.5 pounds. This was one of the deal breakers for me.- Mushy/erratic keyboard. The keyboard was missing keystrokes with fairly heavy typing, and you can visibly see it buckling even with light typing. The whole thing has a chintzy, mushy feel, and leads to a horrible typing experience.- Chintzy plastic touchpad; clicks feel hollow and wobbly. Supports two finger scroll, but not any other two-finger gestures (couldn't right-click with two finger tap, for example)- Battery Life: I eeked out about 3 hours on a good day; otherwise, battery life wasn't impressive.Overall, the heavy weight, low battery life, and sub-par typing experience prompted a return from me. It's not a bad machine, with a nice middle-of-the-road touchscreen and great internal specs; but for a road machine, I needed better battery life and more portability.", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mousepad design is bad", "Author": "Edward F. Kurtz", "ReviewID": "RA9U80V3UED3R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I think this is a nice laptop except for one feature, which I think is terrible.  Somebody got the idea that it would be nice to extend the mouse-behaving area down onto the left and right buttons at the bottom of the pad.  BAD IDEA!  If i am trying to click at a small spot, I have no trouble moving the curser to that spot; however, when I try to click on that spot the curser moves slightly as I press, often moving the curser so that the click fails to give me the effect I want.  I'm giving up on the mousepad entirely, and am switching to a separate wireless USB mouse.", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good stuff.  The whole process was great.

For instance, I cannot easily close screens or apps.  I am sure that is entirely user error.Winows 8.1 update seemed to slow the computer down and it rendered the Screen Brightness Conrols useless.  It was easily fixed with a phone call to the Lenovo techs.  They remotely installed the revised \"Device Driver\" that repaired the problem.Wifi is suspect when away from router.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value", "Author": "Barbara Lindsay", "ReviewID": "R2AJWA8K04EGN7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very happy with my purchase and love it.

Hard to complain at the $330 price for a 3 month old unit, but everything is relative. Even at its $500 + price new, you get allot for the money.ill respond in reference to the complaints I've read in other reviews. Keyboard is not flimsy. Responsive and though the keys are light to the touch (hey, its a laptop so it's supposed to be made of plastic! ) they are responsive. Touch pad works fine, no issues of random movement. I also am new to Windows 8, but ill get it one day. Great processing. Haven't run killer games yet, but programs open quickly and video playback is smooth. No wifi issues . A 3rd gen I5 processor, 6gb ram, good optical drive, backlit keyboard tons of ports, bluetooth, widi. For that price, you don't get all those features in alaptop.yes, is heavy at5.5lbs, but what's a lb here and there?

But, I would NOT purchase it again.Hers why. Skip the DVD drive, it adds a lot of weight to a already HEAVY laptop. Almost too heavy to transport. If you must have a DVD drive, use a portable one.Next, the keyboard is terrible. The miss-keys and response of the keys is the worst. Love the back lite though.Next, the touch pad. The worst I have every used with the right and left licks built into the pad.This is the worst. Useless! The screen is Okay. The i5 processor is more than most will need.
