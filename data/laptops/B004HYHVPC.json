I looked for a while before settling for this one, and I'm not disappointed. My HP died after only 2 years (after the warranty expired of course!) so I wanted to change brands. I settled for ASUS because they have the best reliability reviews among all manufacturers, and it was $550 at Fry's! The Intel core i5 makes this machine run like a breeze. Its screen is brilliant with great color gamut and contrast. The keyboard is chiclet style, and very comfortable. It comes with a numeric keypad, some people may find the keys a little too small, but I find them very useful. I've been running intensive processing software (Seti@home) and the keyboard never felt too hot, core temperatures stayed between 72-79 C. The fan is very quiet and never got too loud even when processors were running at 100%.Pros:Fast processor (comes with Intel's first i5 generation CPUs)Bright screenQuiet fan, keeps cool.Great keyboardNumber padCons:Reflective screen, can be bothering if you have a strong reflection.Poor sound quality: the speakers are on the front, but face downwards, so they give an awkward sound.No discrete graphics card, but at this price, can't complain.Overall, I am very happy with this laptop and would recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004HYHVPC"}}
