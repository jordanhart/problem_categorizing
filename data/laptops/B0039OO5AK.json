It may be a little cheaply built at parts, but runs fast and works great. I have had no issues with the DVD player, USB ports, Audio/Head Phone slots or Ethernet cable slots at all. I use this labtop every day for daily things (school, work, ect) watching movies on it is great too! The screen is nice & Large, good for computer gaming too. I would recomend this computer for an average things, its not specific for any 1 purpose, which is why i love it.

Performance-wise, it's an awesome little computer that's quick and fairly easy to use.  I don't do any video games that would require a fast processor, so I can't comment on that.  The only issues I have with it is 1)the power cord falls out very easily and many times I thought it was plugged in only to have the computer flash a low-battery message or, if I'm on a hidden-object game, just shut off.  2)the touch pad is off center, which takes a little getting used to, and it's very sensitive, so I'll be typing along and the cursor will suddenly jump up several lines.  These issues are just minor aggravations, so I still give the laptop 4 stars.", "Date": "August 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "A reliable computer", "Author": "Tyler", "ReviewID": "R3OXN32G88YRCV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "this is a very nice computer for the price. i underestimated the ability it actually has. it is fast, reliable, and has not given me any problems. i dont do much hardcore gaming, but flight simulator X. it suits me fine at about 10 fps on average, even with a basic processor. i would reccomend this computer, although now i am moving on to a better computer for high school in the 1000 dollar area.", "Date": "November 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP", "Author": "M. Smith \"Blender Guy\"", "ReviewID": "R1G9Q9VMTMSB6E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If I could give it less than 1 star I would. This laptop is poorly designed and not worth the price listed here. For what its worth it when I bought it back in June was about 150 cheaper on newegg.com. The first issue I had was the video wouldn't work with my kvm, it was constantly flashing between video modes. The second issue and one that ultimately lead to its demise was the right mouse button built into the front surface. It's a smooth surface button built into the case and looks like it would be good to work with however due to poor design this one kept clicking on its own. The entire system was rendered useless because the right click was pretty much constantly 'clicking' on its own. I'd tap on it thinking it was stuck and it would be fine for about 5 mins, then it would start again. You cannot deactivate it in the bios or software either.", "Date": "October 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Perfect for my Needs", "Author": "GradyPhilpott", "ReviewID": "R1DFINTO92WDDV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace my netbook that I loved, but accidentally damaged a while back.  My netbook mostly met my needs and I liked its small size.With the advent of Windows 7, some of the advantages of a netbook were lost, in my mind, anyway, so I sought something that would run Windows 7 Home Premium with ease and had an optical drive for a project I was doing at the time, and more comfortable keyboard.This Acer was a perfect fit for me. I'd prefer a smaller footprint, but form really does follow function and the trade-off is really worth it.The unit, plus power cord and mouse fit very well into my briefcase, while leaving plenty of room for other stuff.Business people may prefer the more efficient processors that are coming out now, but for a casual user like myself, this one has what it takes and more.I docked one star, because even though it's perfect for me, there are more powerful and efficient laptops out there for the power users among us.", "Date": "July 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love the Laptop", "Author": "Raymond Foster", "ReviewID": "RA83844A7WXUJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is really every you need.
