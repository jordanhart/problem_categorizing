It came with a larger HDD and only 2 GB ram but that was ok.  I came in a flimsy box but the laptop arrived unharmed. I had my doubts about ordering a laptop on line.  if it did not work i was screwed.  but it came in fine.  I would buy from this store again and again.", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great price, prompt shipping, good communication.", "Author": "gooddog", "ReviewID": "R2S0HEQEKS5W6L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I do my comfort / real computing on my Mac with OSX: I keep that upddated with the latest SW and apps.But I got tired of running into so many cool gadgets that will not work completely with my beloved Macbook Pro 17\" mid 2010.Instead of contaminating my sweet MBP with a Windows installation, I decided to get a sturdy Windows laptop for use with dash-cams, home security cams, blood pressure meters, gamma spectrometers, etc. that work best in Windows.I never thought I could afford a Toughbook, but I stuck a crowbar in my wallet and got this one; amazing bargain!I fear the Window.I decided that XP Pro 32-BIT was the most practical system for the gadgets mentioned above; a limited use, but fun, I hope.CAUTION:Mine came with Windows 7 Pro, without a product key. But I hacked that key out of hiding anyway.At first this seemed great.Soon, however, I learned that Windows 7 Pro IS NOT FULLY SUPPORTED IN THIS MODEL TOUGHBOOK(CF-30CPAZBM  Mark 1).I found I could not lower the display, from eye-searing blaze to comfortable levels using the keyboard nor any control panel in the OS.The speaker volume likewise, except that there is a convenient enough slider, on screen, to adjust this. I don't know how many other functionalities are broken in Windows 7 Professional 32-bit, when used with this model Toughbook.I have had to buy a correct Recovery Disk direct from Panasonic for $35 and it came without a key. I hope the Product Key and Proof Of License numbers on the sturdy OEM sticker on the bottom of this Toughbook are still good, as they look like OEM stickers.The disk arrived today.THIS CORRECT Windows OS to get is the one that came installed, from the factory, by Panasonic (Matsushita) at original purchase.It is WINDOWS XP Professional PANASONIC 32-BIT.I am having to hurry with my setting up of this beauty, because MICROSOFT IS KILLING ALL SUPPORT OF WINDOWS XP THIS APRIL.------------------------------------------WONDERFUL STUFF:* If anyone tries to rob me of this machine, I can slap them silly with it and walk away calmly. It will look and run great - no problem.* It all unscrews apart and spare parts can be had from Panasonic, if you want to trick it out as far as possible - like I do  :)I will upgrade the HDD, from 80GB to 500 GB.I will upgrade the CDR/DVD drive to full CDR/DVDR as well.I will open the LCD display to see about the rainbow, drip stain that comes down to about an inch below the top of the screen.I will install a GPS kit with cool Martian antenna in the upper left corner of the lid.I will have a set of OEM plastic, lid-edge bumper trim for future replacement, in case of scuffs or scratches.I will replace the full-travel, no light keyboard with an OEM, back-lit, chiclet keyboard.I will not go higher than 500 GB on the HDD, nor faster than 56k rpm, because fast, multi-platter HDD's may generate too much heat for this model TB to handle: it has no fans and relies instead on heat-pipe technology. I would not upgrade the CPU either for the same thermal considerations. __________________* The machine was in much better condition than I expected, except for a minor, cosmetic drip stain at the top edge  of the display.* The Battery was in 100% charge condition and appears brand new.* There are so many ports of so many types that my eyes dazzle!  Of course, the monitor port selection does not  include CDMI since this is an old model Toughbook.* All ports and entrances to the machine are covered by locking or clicking flaps to seal in the goodness.* There were no noticeable dings or scratches.* The PWR+ AC Adapter/Charger was not OEM and it can get very warm, but it seems to be OK: I set it on its side to stay cooler.* The speaker single speaker is loud enough and produces  very clear sounds.---------------------------All-in-all, as much as I fear the Windows, I will have fun with this machine.--gd", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Intel Core 2 Duo SU9300 1.66GHz and 2GB of DDR2 RAM\n13.3\" Display\n80GB storing capacity\n802.11 a/b/g/draft-n connectivity feature; connecting to the Internet is like a walk in the park\nWindows 7 Professional 32-Bit", "Name": "Panasonic Toughbook CF-30 Rugged Notebook PC", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51OuzhfmVsL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005UP9L6Y"}}
