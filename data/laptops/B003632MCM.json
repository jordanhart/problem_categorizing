{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very durable laptop!!", "Author": "Brian Sauro", "ReviewID": "R1YLCB8UWR3L56", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop Black Friday 2009, so I've owned it for just about a year now.  I must say it's probably the most durable piece of equipment next to some of the older Lenovos.  I work on computers for a living, so I see my fair share of models and manufacturers come back.  Sony by far is the least that I see come in for manufacturer defects or any other issues.  Obviously software based issues are a different story, and mostly user error anyway :PI've dropped this thing a few times, once on my foot, once while open, spilled a full glass of cheerwine and captain morgan, and the thing didn't even flinch.  The T4300 is a decent middle of the road processor, but it provides plenty of power along with the other laptop specs.  I don't use the blu-ray as much since I have a PS3, but the HDMI out is perfect to stream college basketball games on a 46\" TV from my home team that I don't get to see on regular cable.I would say overall this is one of the more impressive Sony Vaios.  I will definitely stick to Sony laptops in the future.  I know there was a review on overheating, but honestly I haven't experienced this thing get hotter then body temperature, even after having it plugged in for a couple hours while playing COD black ops and downloading stuff at the same time.  I understand the bad reviewer's frustration, but every model has that 1 bad apple!", "Date": "November 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent laptop.  Blu-Ray and HDMI is great!", "Author": "T. L. Yang", "ReviewID": "R3KROCXXA06MYX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not sure what the guy with the heating issue is doing with his laptop.  I push mine very hard and I don't have any heating issues.  It may get a little warm at times, but no heating issues.  I love the blu-ray and HDMI.  It's like having my own home theater.I've had this for a year and it's done everything I've asked it to.  No complaints whatsoever.  It looks clean and cut.  No complaints here.", "Date": "November 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Overheating A SERIOUS Issue", "Author": "Haroun A. Elayed \"<(*-*<) -Kirby\"", "ReviewID": "R3SPOJ9UN1GPVG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Sony is not only recalling a large amount of overheating laptops, but declining a large amount of overheating laptops due to their lack of customer service. I purchased this laptop on black friday and it recently overheated melting the laptop casing, keyboard, and touchpad. Sony declined it saying it I tampered with the device when I had Best Buy send it in for me they changed their story saying it was liquid damage. They said they needed $500 to fix the laptop and I refused to pay that because it was still under warranty. If Sony is going to default on their warranties like this they don't deserve to sell their products to individuals who can't afford to feed the greedy corporate hands of Sony. This laptop SERIES, the NW series is something I highly recommend you stay FAR away from. Sony is showing us that overheating is a common issue in their laptops and that they aren't prepared to let their shareholders down by actually fixing the products. If you have this laptop and are having overheating issues even to the extent of my overheating issue please contact me.", "Date": "August 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Just got it.

It has enough memory and speed for Amazon browsing, Email, and casual document processing. This is my second (now I have a spare battery, HD and power supply).

It has survived Daytona Bike week, Myrtle Beach Bike week and Laconia Bike week 4 times. Been in backpacks traveling 80+mph with extreme vibration, all with no issues. I have never had an issue with it overheating, it does kick the fan on from time to time, but even when it was sitting on the bed, it still didnt have an issue. BluRay works great, speakers arent as bad as everyone says, I use headphones as well however, just due to ambient noise.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Greatest Computer", "Author": "Marshall L.

Granted, the only thing that truly matters when it comes to having a computer is the ability to use certain software. This computer has never failed me.

The only downside is the sound quality, but I fixed that by using headphones. Still worth a 5/5. I paid $600 for mine from Best Buy back in November for Black Friday in 2010. Now you can get laptops with twice as good performance for that price so buying this laptop will enable you to save even more money. I didn't want to write a major review like others because the specs are all there for you to read on your own. You can't go wrong with this laptop, you've got my word on it.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sony Vaio Laptop VGN-NW265F", "Author": "Mr. Chris Jennings", "ReviewID": "R1H6IKSFX5VOEO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this laptop since November 2009, and I have not experienced any difficulties or encountered any problems yet.
