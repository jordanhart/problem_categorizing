SPEEDY delivery!  Yay for this great vendor!I've been using a computer for -- well, my first computer's operating system was DOS!  If you can figure out how to finagle your way around Windows 8, you can get this operating system to work like it was Windows 7 and have it boot directly to the desk top, yet with a swipe of the side of the screen, TaDAAAAH! you can pretend it's an android system and play Angry Birds!  But a full-blown gaming PC it is not, so set that dream aside.  But for a notebook PC, the 4 built in speakers with optimized volume and Dolby Sound are nothing short of amazing!  In other words, earbuds ARE optional!  No, it's not going to fill a whole room with reverberating stadium sound, but for a notebook computer, these speakers put out some pretty decent sound WITH volume.  It just doesn't have the processor speed for \"action games\" on the web, and while the screen is an actual 10 point touch screen, it also has all of the flaws of a narrow viewing angle desktop monitor, so don't expect to set it on the coffee table to watch Netflix with the family with any great success.  What this machine does allow me to do is do productive Microsoft Office work on it with MY software stored on MY 750 gigabyte hard drive (no cloud for serious work!) yet \"be a toy\" with the apps and 10 point touch screen games that most people play on their Android tablets.  Hey,  what could be better than that?

Oh and it cam three days early then they said it would so shipping for me was great.  4 stars do to no cd-dvd driveUpdateIt is the first of June and it now has a blank screen, have E-mail the seller being a Sunday it might be a while until I hear back. Will keep you updated on how it goes and what and how this seller deals with problems. And this was ship to a VA address so can not say how fast it would have gotten to WA statewell after an hr the screen came back on by it self not sure what the problem was or is but it is now working again.one other thing when I type on here if my finger or thumb goes over the mouse pad it will move the line of type to the middle of the sentence and mess it up so as others have said you have to be careful when typing. I am a guy who looks where he is typing and not up so by the time I have looked up I am starting all over again LOL  the plug does come out and still look like it is in so have to watch for that may only be mine but just something to check on I have too. will be updating as i think of things of importants.", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Refurbished and works great", "Author": "Ryan Scobey \"\"its better to look ugly and...", "ReviewID": "R3HTT7RYU75DF0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hard to beat a deal like this, I would recommend this laptop to anyone that needs a casual laptop or gaming laptop.", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love this laptop!", "Author": "Donald Feld", "ReviewID": "RDS11K5Y3TTFT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For being as thin as it is and granted it's a 15.6-inch screen, it is a little hefty.

The light up key board was a nice surprise, makes for typing in low light and the dark great.
