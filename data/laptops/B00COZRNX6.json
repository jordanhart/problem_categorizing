{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very Good Buy, Compact but Powerful", "Author": "Pavanas Incusus", "ReviewID": "R1QKTFODUIMANK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This small unit is based on Linux (a unix), which is robust and not prone to computer viruses. It includes free updates and upgrades as well as security and application upgrades over the internet. A caveat: it does not come with a sofware cd. One should also buy a \u00a8Live CD\u00a8 (a bootable cd that can to be used recover system in case of mishap.). Another item to go with this purchase would be at least a 4 port 3.0 powered USB hub (for peripherals i.e. external cd/dvd, printer, external HDDs and so forth). The included software should be more than sufficient for one's everyday computer needs,  if additional software is needed there is a vast library of free software available for  the Ubuntu O/S. As to ease of operation? If one is familar with Windows, this O/S should present no problems. Lastly the HDMI port on the unit connects to a HDMI port of a HDTV giving the unit a much larger monitor screen. Good deal in a small package at a reasonable cost?", "Date": "March 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "OpenSuse 13.1 OK Here Too", "Author": "Andrew Cooke", "ReviewID": "R1STLN7SSXWBL0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I previously had a 1015E-DS03 (see also my review there), but spilled a glass of coke all over it.Despite its age, there still doesn't seem to be anything else similar to this little machine when it comes to Linux compatibility so I bought a new one, only to find that the model number had changed slightly.  The only change from the DS03 that I can see is that the lid has a matte finish.As with the DS03, OpenSuse 13.1 installs fine.  There is a weird issue with the UEFI boot when you update kernels - Google for my name and the computer model to find my blog post describing the fix (too long to copy here and Amazon doesn't allow links).The mouse pad is still pretty bad.

I've purchased an Asus 1000HE netbook and I love it and still use it.  I wanted a Linux netbook so I gave this one a try.  The wireless connection kept dropping out, even when I was located 2 feet from my wireless router.  None of my other wireless devices worked so unreliably.  The mouse/touchpad was awful.  Nearly impossible to cut/paste anything without it jetting off of the needed field.  The \"button\" and the capacitive touchpad are the same (no separate buttons) so if you slide your finger at all when depressing, it moves the mouse and misses the target.I liked Ubuntu.  I may just buy a more reliable netbook and load Ubuntu on it.I've had stellar results with Asus products except this one.  I've purchased a full size Win7 laptop and it's great.  I bought one of their AMD quad core motherboards and it's also pretty good.  I'm typing on the 1000HE netbook now and I've had reliable results from it for over 4 years.However, the 1015E-DS02 is a dog.  I could have put up with the silly mouse behavior (although I would have cursed it a lot I think :-) but there is NO excuse for the shoddy WiFi performance.Stay away from this one.  It has a fundamental design issue.  Reading some of the feedback articles here will indicate the same.After one week using it, I returned it to Amazon.

This small netbook however is a bit finicky.  The touchpad is extremely sensitive, set to it's slowest cursor movement settings, the cursor is still difficult to land on a specific point.The wireless constantly disconnects and reconnects from WiFi points, creating an aggravating experience.Unity is the default desktop.

I thought that I could get back into it.  However, after about six months, I was getting somewhat frustrated with Ubuntu, not being to do my usual daily stuff.  I ended up wiping the hard drive and installing Windows 8 with Start Menu 8 by iObit which gave me the newest MS OS with the look of Win 7.  This has turned out to be an excellent little computer that has unbelievable battery life.  It now resides in our den and is used daily to do minor work and web browsing.  I can print wirelessly to either of my two printers in the other end of the house - one is on our home network and the other is a wireless printer.

It was functional and it's slowness acceptable in that timeframe, Windows Starter was lacking and problems with IE made it a pain at times.  i decided to try the new model to use for a clinic that I consult with. They needed something to use in the exam room with patient data viewed and recorded.I found that performance had increased but still when not \"plugged in\" it was slow and the screen dimmed to being unreadable from a short distance,,,, if you pass on this juice savings  then the battery life just isn't there. I had great hopes for Ubuntu. I have had disdane for Windows since Bill Gates was a snot nosed litlte kid back in 1980. Since I am much older and have less patience compared to then I need something that works out of the box even if it falls way short like W8 does. Ubuntu appears to be a \"hobby\" and \"communal experiment\" rather than a commercial product ( I can feel the warmth of the flames coming my way!) I spent a day trying to find display drivers and make them work. ASUS support website is useless regarding Ubuntu, It went back to Amazon in a box.
