Build quality of the Yoga 2 Pro is exceptional, the high resolution display is sharp and bright, touchscreen sensitive and accurate and the slightly larger screen size makes the Yoga 2 Pro easier to use for document and content creation. It's my first Windows 8.1 machine but I was quickly able to configure away the very minor amount of installed crapware and install my application software from an external USB-interfaced DVD reader. I don't miss the lack (or weight) of a build in optical drive.I don't mean to sound like shill, but when a Windows computer with powerful i7 processor boots up in less than fifteen seconds I'm in love. I hope we have a long and happy relationship.", "Date": "May 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "David L Quinn", "ReviewID": "R2O45WTA2K30HC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Meet all my requirements, love it.
