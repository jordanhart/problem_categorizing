{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Well built laptop, you get what you pay for.", "Author": "Sean", "ReviewID": "R3INO3TTDY4BUA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Despite all the negative reviews, I took a chance and bought this laptop, and overall, it is a great laptop for the price.Pros:It is very quick.  The i5-3317u, despite being a low voltage variant of the i5, is surprisingly quick for a 17 watt processor, it is capable of downclocking itself to a minimum of 0.7ghz to preserve battery life, and turbo boost can push it to 2.7ghz when needed for that extra bit of oomph.I haven't tried gaming too much with it yet, and although my expectations were not very high for it being integrated graphics, the HD 4000 chip has surprised me, I am able to run Batman: Arkham Asylum on very high perfectly, albeit with Antialiasing and anisotropic filtering turned down.  Borderlands 2 runs without a hitch with most settings on high as well.It is very light weight, and incredibly thin, it's hard to believe that this laptop has as much stuff packed into it as it does, with such a slim form factor.This laptop stays very cool under nearly all circumstances, most of the time the bottom is only somewhat warm, after a good while of regular usage.  It warms up a bit while gaming, but that is to be expected.  The fan will ramp up a bit under heavier load, but it's never loud enough to be annoying.Physically, it feels very solid.  There is next to no give in the chassis, and several of the larger pieces, including the top of the lid and the top of the laptop in which the keyboard is set are both made of what feels to be brushed aluminum, although I am not sure about whether or not it actually is.The screen is very nice, it has a large range of brightness settings, and although it would certainly be nice if it was a full 1080p screen, that is a luxury to be saved for more expensive laptops.  I like that it is a 14\" screen because it's bigger than netbooks, but it's a tad smaller than most 15.6\" laptops, making it a bit more portable.It has a disk drive which is usually left out of laptops of this size and form factor for the sake of size and weight, but that doesn't seem to have affected this laptop very much.  The disc drive works fine, although it's audible when it's spinning a CD at full speed.Cons:Battery life:  Despite this being an ultrabook, battery life is where it suffers compared to other offerings in the same price range, due to the relatively small 4-cell 44w/hr battery.Windows 8:  I knew that this laptop had windows 8 when I ordered it, so it can't really be listed as a con, but I'm not too fond of Windows 8, although I've gotten used to it after having been using it for a week now.  Windows 8.1 fixes a lot of things, such as being able to boot straight to the desktop, but the amount of microsoft account integration that it tries to force, I don't like.The bloatware is another thing that I'd be happier without, new, it comes with a decent amount of bloatware, as well as Mcaffee internet security which is a resource hog and annoying to fully remove.  I've seen more bloatware on computers before, but I prefer less, for obvious reasons.Other comments:The touchpad does not have separated physical buttons, which may take some time to get used to, but it is a nice, fairly large and very responsive touchpad which I don't mind using, although I still much prefer a mouse.  It is not very conducive to gaming, but touchpads in general aren't exactly designed for gaming.The keyboard is an island style keyboard, and while not fantastic, is a nice keyboard, which I have been typing this review on, and it is a fairly nice keyboard, and well laid out as well.  The right shift key is made a bit smaller as well as the space bar to make room for the arrow keys on the right side of the keyboard but this change has not affected my typing whatsoever.The function keys are a bit oddly laid out, with the volume and brightness controls on the function keys, F5 through F7 for brightness, and F10 through F12 for volume with the arrow keys instead being multimedia functions(play/pause, stop, next track, previous track)  which is a bit odd, but nothing more than a small difference, although trying to press the fn key and adjust the volume with those keys can be challenging with one hand.The speakers are quite good, for laptop speakers that is, and the webcam is decent quality, although I will not use it much.If bought new, it comes with one year Accidental Damage Protection through ASUS, which is fairly easy to register for.  It only allows one claim within the year period, but it is free, and better than no protection, so I will not complain.The ports are all very snug when new, but they get better as they are used.  For the power and headphone jacks, I am very glad that they are snug, but with the USB ports, I was nearly afraid that something was broken with the amount of force that was required to insert my USB mouse's reciever into the port for the first time, although it has since gotten better.Conclusion:Overall, this is a great laptop with a few low points that if remedied would make this a truly spectacular laptop, but for the price, it is still a great deal.  It is well built, and seems like it will be able to stand the test of time quite well.  I look forward to using this laptop for years to come.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop", "Author": "Student", "ReviewID": "R2MAXLJUS0SN7E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great laptop overall. It's fast and stays cool all the time (I actually start feeling cold when it's sitting on my lap). The build quality is great. Now it's obviously not the best quality like macbooks, but for the price it is great. I actually dropped it several times on a tiled floor from my desk and the worst that happened was that the battery popped out a little. Some of the reviews on here mentioned that the fan is always on. This is true, but it is very quiet. You would only hear it if you were in a room that was completely silent.The only bad thing about this laptop is that the touchpad is a bit sensitive and it can get annoying when typing and accidentally touching it, causing the mouse to click somewhere else.Now I didn't say anything about the os (Windows 8) because it is a review for the laptop, but I just want to say that I hated Windows 8. I installed Ubuntu on the laptop, so now I could dual boot into either that or Windows 8 whenever I need to. I use Ubuntu as my daily driver though, and it is awesome on this laptop. I would recommend installing Ubuntu, or downgrading to Windows 7 as others have done.", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not thrilled", "Author": "Malloy", "ReviewID": "R2W0TVMU7L441D", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I expected more from this computer. It isn't as quick as I needed and it bogs down when more that just a few screens are open. I use this for work and have an Asus as my personal computer as well but don't know that I will get another. The other issue is the monitor plug in. It hasn't worked from day 1. At first I got a screen that went from normal to blue and now nothing. To duplicate screens it senses that the monitor is there but can't project a picture. Overall very disappointed. I didn't expect this from a new non refurbished machine.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "The fan noise is sharp", "Author": "Mi Hao", "ReviewID": "R1NF21CNQHEPV4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The laptop is ok, but the most annoying thing is the fan noise, may be the noise comes from the HDD, I don't know.I compared it with my old thinkpad and HP one, this one's noise is much sharper, although not very loud.Checked with the seller, decided to keep it otherwise I need to pay 15% processing fee which is about 80 bucks.", "Date": "June 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Absolutely fantastic.", "Author": "Gann", "ReviewID": "R1UNFXQMMZY70X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's sleek, it's fast, and it does basic stuff very well.

I can't even hear it running.My battery lasts between 4-6 hours depending on what I'm doing.I will say that when this laptop first arrived, the OS was installed to the 750GB drive instead of the SSD. I installed Windows 7 to the SSD, which didn't leave much room on it after, but I install the programs to the other drive and it is still quite zippy.It boots in about 5-7 seconds.Love it!

reviewed when I just bought it", "Author": "JustAReader \"NoNeed2Comment\"", "ReviewID": "RKHI5WP7W2NH5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "updated 2/20/2014further using experience on this amaing laptop's keyboard:the thing bothering me most now is that i just can't type a word or sentence correctly. the letter i typed simply jumping all over the places, insert itself into or between the words or the lines i've typed. there's no way to control and administer the key on the keyboard to type out a word correctly. it went as it like to go behind or insert any sentence or word i've already typed, and i have to try so hard to locate the letter once i found the letter i typed did not appear where it should be. asus did an amazing job to create a keyboard with keys of their own free and liberal mind. not just the weird and very uncomfortable spongy feeling when your finger tapped on those funny keys i've mentioned before.this is absolutely amazing. i must remind asus to get international patent for this keyborad before some other laptop manufacturers stealing this great invention.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------after several months and periodically turned it on, this S405CA-RH51 Ultrabook proved to be the worst laptop i could ever imagine that i bought! how stupid i was and how stupid i am.the windows 8 os is just eye-candy setting that serves without any practical purpose.the worst faulty battery that only could hold about 2 to 3 hours time, even without doing anything by just turning it on, you will see the juice just leaking away so fast by the minutes.this horrible so-called 'ultrabook' is also very heavy.if you try to open it when it was closed, the screen and its backing cover might pop open in the middle edge and you have to pinch them together with your fingers to snap it back! it's a very fragile, weak framing, just like two plywood pieces, they never glue properly, so they are very easy to pop open.but the most annoying and disgusting weakness is its battery, it just start to drain quickly once you turn it on. even you plug it with a/c adaptor, it sometimes shows 'fully charged', but most of the time, it might show '99% fully charged' or '97%...'.hey, ASUS, it a new laptop, okay?! how could you guys release such a lousy machine and fool us to buy? it's actully a junk, a 100% piece of garbage.oh, one more thing:unless you connect it directly to the router with ethernet cable or put the laptop within 3 feet to the router, it will show you a 99% wi-fi connection, but if you move away a bit afar, say, to the next room, the connection will suddenly drop to 60, 65, 70, or as high as to 80%. so it means that you asus has used an inferior and cheap wi-fi card for this machine.my other dell studio 17 can always have a 99% wi-fi connection in a downstairs room, and my router is on the 2nd floor. if i put this ultra heavy and dumb asus i5 next to the dell studio 17, the connecting will drop so fast and so low to a very unstable connecting status from 60% to 78%, depending what the wi-fi card's moods and always changing and fluctuating. it could never maintain in a stable connecting status, yet my dell studio 17 always maintains a 99% connection, it almost never dropped.the keyboard: every key when you type, it gives you a very spongy, flimsy funny feeling that will make you so unsure to yourself and wonder if you are typing on the right key. this keyboard was designed so bad and it's the first time when i hate to type. the only way to get rid of this hateful feeling is connecting a usb regular keyboard to type normally.there's nothing for me to say 'good' about this piece of crap, absolutely nothing. shame on you, asus. you should recall this series and fire the production manager of this so-called ultra(heavy) lousy book. i will never buy anything from asus from now on, it sucks big time!but this stupid model still got some minor good so far that just kept me not throw it away or crash it with my shoes:1) it's so quiet, quiet like it actually is turned off. some other users complained the fan noise, but i just doubt this unit really got a fan, or really needs a fan to cool it off, 'cause there seems no heat coming out of it, the keyboard and the touch pad areas are just cool or even cold to the touch.2) although this machine never got 5 full bars to get a nice connection from the router upstairs unless you connect it directly with an ethernet cable to the router, the download speed is actually amazingly fast, faster than what i pointed out that my other dell studio 1745 which always got 99% connection. but this machine's can download many video or audio 10 times faster than the dell studio 17. so most of the time now i use it to download stuff from the web, then transfer them onto flash drive and watch on dell's extended 27\" monitor. the resolution of this asus is horrible if i connect it with hdmi cable to the large monitor, the pixels of this asus sucks big time, it only got 1366x768, it even got a warning from its own 'display\": your resolution is lower than ----x900, some items might not fit in your display\", so once you connect it even with an ultra sharp monitor, the screen still shows a fuzzy 1366x768 absolutely unwatchable low density image. this is how such the machine is. some items might not fit in your display, are you serious? limited viewing angles plus laughable low resolution. asus, why did you do this to torture us? so guys, check out the display's resolution first before you decide to buy a laptop. i don't mean you've got to have a retina resolution screen, but a laughable 768?so even it's cool and with a fast download speed, the score simply cannot raise from 1 star to 2 stars.", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$834.74", "Features": "2.6GHz Intel Core I5-3317U Processor\n6GB DDR3 Memory / 750GB Hard Drive\nIntel HD Graphic 4000\nWindows 8", "Name":
