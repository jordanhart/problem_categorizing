{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I switched to Mac and all I got was this stupid smile", "Author": "Julia", "ReviewID": "R3LSRN96Y69UAH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded to a new Vista laptop last year, and have been unhappy and frustrated with it from the start.  When my daughter's laptop died a horrible death, I really didn't want to go through the same Vista pains with her, so I decided to replace it with a Mac (it's going to be a Christmas present, so shhh!).  As designated tech support for my family and friends, I started learning everything I could about Mac before she started asking questions.  The more I learned about it, the more I wanted one for myself, and now that I have one, I am really kicking myself for not switching last year.It's simply beautiful.  I know it sounds like I drank the apple-flavored Kool-Aid, but the Macbook really is a marvel of elegant form and function.  It feels solid and substantial, without being bulky and heavy.  the aluminum design is a work of art, and I really appreciate all of the eco-friendly choices that were made regarding the components.The LED screen is brighter and clearer than my old laptop's LCD screen.  Looking at them side by side, the difference is amazing (and my old laptop was marketed as a portable entertainment PC, with an upgraded screen).  I don't know what kind of LCD screens some of the other users have, but the Macbook screen is far superior to any notebook screen I've ever seen.The back-lit keyboard is great - no more keyboard light needed. The keys have a solid feel to them, they're not mushy or noisy like some keyboards can be, they're just right, and the key layout is just like a full-size keyboard - no more hunting to figure out where the heck the backslash key is hidden or hitting the wrong key because your pinky slipped off of an undersized shift key.I'll admit that I couldn't figure out the trackpad at first, but I felt like a dork once I realized how simple it is.  I did change the settings so that I can tap to click in addition to pressing down on the trackpad (since that's what I'm used to).  It's just incredibly easy once you get going.  Swipe two fingers down the pad to scroll, swipe four for expose, tap with two fingers for secondary-click... it does more straight out of the box than my old highly-programed touch-pad.  And after about an hour, the gestures become second-nature.As far as the built-in speakers go, they're nicer than I expected, especially since I can't figure out how the heck they fit any speakers into such a tiny case.  Seriously, it's like the whole case is the speaker.  As I type this review, I'm listening to the album Paradise Lost by Symphony X and It sounds pretty good to me.  of course, it sounds even better played through my Klipsch Room Groove, but um.. hey... they're integrated laptop speakers - though they are very nice ones.There are only two USB ports, but since the keyboard and trackpad are so functional, you won't need external input devices (though a number pad is a must for me when doing a lot of data-entry).  I only use USB for external storage and synching my iPod, so it's not a problem for me (my iPod touch has a program that lets it act like a number pad when I need one).  If I ever need more devices at once, I'll get a USB hub.Now, it's confession time:  As a Windows-centric IT Professional, I never liked Apple much, and I spent many years making fun of Mac and Mac users.  When OS X came out, I couldn't justify further ridicule, so I just ignored Mac whenever the subject came up.  After using Leopard for a short time, I can tell you that I don't have the appetite to eat the big heaping serving of humble pie that I'm owed.  Leopard is slick and smooth and oh so fast.  I'm truly enamored with iLife and iWork, and Time Machine is just about perfect (better than shadow copies, for the Windows guys and gals).  It's packed with a lot of little things (like Spotlight and Preview) that are unobtrusive and helpful, which is a vast improvement over Vista's annoying and unhelpful features.So, now I'm a happy convert.  I still have two programs that are Windows-only (until I find replacements), and I still go back to my old (1 year old) laptop occasionally (for just the two, I don't want to bother with Boot Camp or Parallels).  I hate going back to Vista after using my Macbook.  Even though that laptop technically has higher RAM and processor specs than the Macbook, it's slow and clunky in comparison.  I always sigh in relief when I can put it away again.Bottom line:  I love my Macbook and I wish I hadn't waited so long to make the switch.  If you're worried about switching to Mac, visit an Apple Store - even if you have to make a day trip to get there, it will be worth it.  Spend a little hands on time with the Macbook, and check out all the free classes the store offers.  If you buy from the store, they will move your files from your old PC for you (for free).  If all of that doesn't convince you, then come see me, and I'll offer you a tall, refreshing glass of Apple-flavored Kool-Aid. :-)", "Date": "December 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Phenomenal Laptop", "Author": "Mia Chong", "ReviewID": "R2XIJXRL7B6UQE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: - GREAT OS- Lightning fast- Light-weight, sturdy unibody design- Attractive design- Dashboard- Incredible screen- Great trackpad- Good battery life- Keyboard is excellent- Magsafe adapter- Excellent iSight Camera- Boot camp availableCons: - Glossy screen quite reflective- Screen is fingerprint prone- No FireWire- Small amount of game functionality- Battery not as good as advertised- Distant longing for physical trackpad button- Multi-touch gestures not entirely spot-onSummary: The new Macbook. It's incredible. With faults. That's all I'm going to say for my introduction. Read on.Physical SpecsThe product physically is very sturdy, thanks to the unibody construction. Normally the chassis would normally consist of various small parts. So instead of taking a small piece of aluminum and adding more aluminum, Apple has taking a big piece of aluminum and subtracted from it. Thus creating a sturdy, yet light laptop. I have heard that the aluminum interferes with internet connectivity issues. I do have to say, unfortunately, it is true. I put the Macbook and my old PC laptop side by side, and the PC was able to pick up better frequency and more networks.Now for the multi-touch trackpad. It is made from glass, but it feels like there is a covering on it that doesn't nearly have the friction of glass. Clicking and moving the cursor is very easy and enjoyable, with the very large surface. Right-clicking can be done with by clicking with two fingers or by clicking one of the bottom corners after being manually set. It should also be noted that only the bottom 3/4 of the trackpad is clickable.The multi-touch gestures are fun to use, but are truly unneeded gimmicks that could be done easier with a click.I'll just go through the gestures now.There are 2 finger gestures:The first is scrolling with using two fingers by swiping your fingers vertically or horizontally depending on the page.Secondly you can rotate a picture using two fingers apart and rotating.The third gesture is holding the control button and scrolling vertically to zoom in on a page.And there is one 3-finger gesture:Swipe with three fingers to navigate. You can do this to go forward or back on a page, or changing a picture.Lastly there are 4-finger gestures:Swiping vertically upwards allows you to clear everything off your desktop.Swiping vertically down launches Expose.Swiping horizontally in any direction lets you change and view your running applications, which can also be done with command+tab.On the bottom of the MacBook there is a panel that allows for easy access to your battery and hard drive. This will be handy to many people.The keyboard is just like the Air, with the spaces between the keys. This creates a very nice typing experience, and are backlit if you purchase the 2.4GHz model.A major letdown by Apple is the omission of a FireWire port. This is very disappointing to many people, but doesn't affect me at all. Nowadays the average users don't use FireWire too much. Although I do see this as a major problem for professional applications.There is also a battery life indicator on the side of the base that glows green to show the rounded percentage of your battery.Software and PerformanceOf course the MacBook has the great Mac OS X Leopard software.It is very fast, and has good security.The battery life is advertised to have 5 hours of battery life, but Apple obviously means not being connected to the Internet, and having no applications running. You'll probably get about 4 and a half hours with Safari and other apps running. Unless you have a lot of apps on like me, then you'll maybe have 3 and a half to 4 hours.With the NVidia graphics card, the screen looks pretty good, as do games. I do have to admit, though, the new MacBook Pro screen looks better, especially with blacks. Still, games really pop on the gorgeous glossy screen, unless you are in a bright area. The glossy screen of course attracts bad glares and many noticeable fingerprints. Still, if you are indoors or someplace with low light, the glossy screen is perfect. I mostly use it inside, so I wouldn't trade the beautiful glossy screen. Although for those coffee-shop typing folks, this could be a deal-breaker.Other than these things, Mac OS X is the same, really.ConclusionIf you have purchased a MacBook anytime soon, then I would not suggest you purchase this one. Most of the differences are the physical attributes, and the software is pretty much the same.If you are new to Macs like me, then I would DEFINITELY suggest this phenomenal notebook computer. Of course it does have it's faults, truly I have never used such a simple, enjoyable computer.", "Date": "October 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "The definitive new laptop experience", "Author": "J. D. Walters \"Heyzeus7\"", "ReviewID": "R2WH4TMDLVFXLR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "(Disclaimers: I am not an IT professional so I cannot judge the Macbook's performance based on any technical standards such as benchmark CPU tests, etc. Also, I got the machine, AppleCare and full software suite at a student discount from my university's laptop program, which I take for granted.)My first college laptop was a Dell Latitude D610. It was a fantastic machine for its price, doing everything I needed it to do. But recently I heard that PC laptops are only expected to last around 4 years before giving out, so I decided to take advantage of my school's discount program and buy a new laptop before I graduated. A tech supervisor I talked to sold me on the superior quality and durability of the Macbook, and when I saw the new line of Aluminum Macbooks on the Apple site I decided after a lot of research and thought to go for it. It arrived December 1 and I've been using it ever since.All I can say is that switching from PC to Mac has been a revelation. The new Macbook is the most impressive laptop I have ever seen. It is supremely easy to use, with a much more attractive, centralized software handling experience than Windows. Below I give a brief summary of how my computing experience has changed for the better since making the switch to Mac.-Portability: my Dell laptop was portable, but it was also bulky, heavy, and seemed fragile when I carried it in one hand. The new Macbook is slim, light and incredibly sturdy. For the first time I feel comfortable with taking my laptop everywhere, from taking notes in class to working on a paper at the library or dining hall. I bought a Kensington Contour Cargo Notebook Messenger to carry it in and it has enough space for everything I need to carry during my school day, including my laptop. I now have the complete portable college computing experience.-Speed: I didn't take my Dell laptop out of my room very often because it was very slow to 'wake up' from sleep mode. The new Macbook both sleeps and wakes on the drop of a dime, making it a true notebook, i.e. a machine that you can jot something down on whenever you feel the need. That combined with its portability makes it the perfect mobile computing platform.-Operating System: the Mac OS X Version 10.5.4 Leopardis a much, more more attractive, efficient operating system than Windows. The user interface is more intuitive, more customizable and more centralized. Even though I've used Windows all my life (I can remember all the way back to Windows 3.1, 95, 98, 2000 and XP) I already much prefer the Dock to the Start icon, the Finder to Windows Explorer and the automatic appearance of peripherals on the Desktop instead of the bubble 'New Hardware Found' option in Windows. Everything about the Mac OS X just works better. And now that the Mac is becoming increasingly compatible with Windows suites such as Office and Adobe, there's no excuse to hold on to Windows.-Trackpad: I don't own an iPhone or iPod touch, so I only just discovered the magic of multi-finger gestures with the new Macbook's trackpad, and I am hooked. I just love the two-finger scroll option, and the four-finger Eclipse function is something from the future. I use it all the time when working on a paper and I need to quickly look up an article or dictionary online, while at the same time checking my email or playing albums on Youtube or iTunes. I don't use a conventional mouse anymore, except for playing RPGs. Trust me. The new trackpad is just that awesome.-Screen: my Dell had a matte screen with good resolution for what it had to do. But the new Macbook glossy screen is absolutely gorgeous for watching movies or any other multi-media function. The picture is brighter, sharper and clearer. Users perhaps have a point that the viewing angle is small, but the only problem I've had when watching movies or using other applications is when I put my face down on the desk as I'm working, and I doubt many people use a laptop from that position. The picture is sharp and clear even from 'over-the-shoulder' angles from quite far away. Where the screen really shines, though, is with HD video. I watched remastered Star Trek episodes on CBS and it was a dream, along with HD trailers from the Apple website. If you're thinking of getting a Macbook, don't listen to people who say that the screen is terrible. It's not terrible. It might not satisfy the ultra-purists but for ordinary users the difference in quality is probably not noticeable. What IS noticeable is the difference in quality between a PC matte screen and the new Apple LED-backlit glossy screen that adjusts for ambient light. A final word about reflectiveness: the glossy screen is quite reflective, it's true. But the screen is bright enough to overshadow the reflections in all circumstances I've used it in, including outdoors in bright sunlight. Also, for me at least the reflections are like gestalt psychology: I can focus on the screen or on the reflections but not both at the same time.-Keyboard: this will vary with people's preference, but I just love Apple's chicklet keyboard. I'm a fast typer and the easy depression and the crisp 'click' sound the keys make somehow just feels right. I feel more productive when I'm using a chicklet, don't ask me why. For me at least the advertisements were right: it is a better typing experience than the standard PC keyboard.-Peripherals: I don't use any Firewire devices so the lack of a Firewire port has never been a problem for me. I never use more than two USB devices at a time anyway so the Macbook's two USB ports is just right for me. The only problem I have with the new Macbook as far as peripherals are concerned (and one of the only problems I have with the new Macbook period) is the lack of any way to connect with a standard AV/Composite input TV. The only media output peripheral is the new MiniDisplay port which with the right adapter can link with DVI, HDMI or digital VGA but not S-video. There's NO way to get around this, believe me I've tried. No combination of adapters will do the trick. This is kind of a bummer because I've become accustomed to watching Netflix Instant Viewing titles on an old Acer 27\" TV I bought for 50 bucks. Those days are gone. But I'm selling the TV when I graduate in the spring, and by the time I get a new one it will probably an HDTV like Samsung LNS3251D 32-Inch LCD HDTV, so it won't matter anyway.-Software: I can pretty much guarantee you that for any kind of application available in Windows, the Apple version is better. Safari is a far better web browser than Internet Explorer (although the free Mozilla Firefox is better than Safari), Apple Mail along with iCal beats Outlook by a country mile, iTunes is much better than Windows Media Player, etc. I even prefer the Apple version of Microsoft Office to the Windows version for its ease of use, appealing graphic user interface, etc. That combined with the overall superior Mac operating system makes for a much more sophisticated, delightful computing experience. It's fast and reliable. And when you think of other Apple applications with no obvious counterpart in Windows like iWeb, there's really no good reason not to switch to the Macbook.-Compatibility: so far the only compatibility issue I've had with PC vs Mac is Netflix Instant Viewing. For a long time you had to have Internet Explorer to watch their catalog online. All that has changed now with Netflix's adoption of their new Silverlight based Instant Viewing player. Now Intel Mac users (and the new Macbook has an Intel Duo processor, see the tech specs) can watch the whole Netflix catalog online, and it's faster and more efficient than before. The picture seems to be a bit grainier than with the other player, but I imagine that will change. Printers, USB cameras, flash drives, etc. all work just fine with the new Macbook.I could go on about all the reasons I love my new Macbook, such as the ability to link up with the iTunes playlists of other Macbooks and listen to other people's music, the long battery life, etc. but for now I'll conclude by saying that I am completely satisfied with my new toy. It does everything I need it to do and more. Ignore the naysayers, there's no such thing as a perfect product. Everyone will find something to gripe about. I think it was worth every penny and will serve you very well for years to come.P.S. If you're making the switch from PC to Mac I strongly suggest buying or borrowing David Pogue's Switching to the Mac: The Missing Manual, Leopard Edition. It will make the transition smooth and quick and you'll instantly have all the formidable potential of your new Macbook at your fingertips.", "Date": "December 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Not quite what we were hoping for...", "Author": "Mac Tech \"Alan\"", "ReviewID": "RFUD2GXROAALM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I work as an IT manager, overseeing about 4000+ client computers.  About one-fourth of them are Macs.  I myself am a long-time Mac user, currently using a dual-quad Mac Pro and a 1st gen white MacBook, which I love both of them.Full disclosure: I do not own this new MacBook (although I had planned to upgrade), but we bought several for evaluation purposes to determine whether they would be purchased in larger quantities.  I have used one for almost a week now and have developed a love / hate relationship with them.The Good:The unibody is a beautiful design, and makes for a rigid and solid feeling notebook.  I like the fact they've make it easier to perform hard drive and memory upgrades.  The battery indicator on the side is a nice touch, instead of on the bottom, but I admit, I never used it that much, since I tend to check the battery life when it's on and I check it on the menu bar.Once you get used to it, the new trackpad, it's a delight to use, and the new finger gestures are useful.  The new DisplayPort also seems to work well enough, although once again, new adapters will have to purchased.  Some people have complained about the lack of HDMI, but if you read the specs for the DisplayPort standard, it really takes us into the next generation of video display and is a better standard, IMHO.Finally, the new graphics update is much welcomed.  Graphics performance has substantially been increased, and the 2.0 GHz machines we're testing are pretty snappy when using graphics intensive tasks.  We don't play games with these, but I'm sure gamers will welcome the change.  Our Pro Apps are noticeably faster.The Bad:Naturally, this new manufacturing process has to cost Apple more, but we didn't except to pay so much more for a computer with worst [basic] specs than what we were getting in our purchase of the white and black MacBooks.  Except for graphics performance, our CPU benchmarks are very lackluster in comparison.  Our IT budget is very tight right now, and it's going to be hard to justify a purchase with so little difference in performance.  Respectively, each model, compared to the MacBook model it replaced, is only 6% and 12% faster.  These benchmarks have been independently verified by many Mac-related websites.Several of our early testers are complaining about the ultra-glossy (or glassy) screen and the quality of the display itself.  Our offices are brightly-lit and it takes quite a bit of adjustment to properly see the screen without severe glare.  This isn't as noticeable in low-light environments, but we also see poor side-to-side viewing, meaning you almost have to look at these dead-on straight to see a good image.  Comparing it to earlier MacBooks and MBP's, these new models are much worse.  Fingerprints are much more noticeable also, and the glass front bezel seems to be a fingerprint magnet.  That's not a big deal, but they complained that  calibration doesn't help the color flaws in this new display.  These use LED displays, as opposed to TFT displays that the previous MacBook had.  I think it's just a cheaper panel, because other reviews have had no major complaints with LED displays in the new MacBook Pros.Lastly, and most important to me as a technician, is the lack of a FireWire port.  Many of my peripherals are FW and also I frequently use the Target Disk Mode (TDM) in my job of diagnosing, repairing, saving and migrating data from other Macs.  Even though I had planned to upgrade, I now have no choice but to keep what I have.  Also, our Media department will not be getting upgrades.  They also use video and audio FW devices that cannot be substituted or re-purchased simply because Apple choose to leave FW out on this model.  Not only is cost an issue to go to a MacBook Pro, but many of us liked the smaller footprint of the 13\" model.I find it ironic that Apple increased the graphics performance to use their Pro Apps more effectively, but left out the very port that is used to import the video and audio files for those Pro Apps to work with?  Many of us would have even traded the ethernet port for the FW port, since you can get a USB to Ethernet dongle.Also, since our department uses cloning software to quickly install drive images for our clients, this will affect us dramatically.  USB, is not only much, MUCH slower, but less reliable.  You have to turn off any software that may execute during the clone.  In our tests, we found something as small as \"Little Snitch\" coming on during a clone install, is enough to choke a USB drive to almost stopping the clone process.  It's a much slower and more unreliable process.I know some people have stated that FW is dead, but no, it isn't.  It is continuing to be developed into a faster standard.  And USB-3 isn't a reality yet, so saying that USB-3 is coming anyway, doesn't do anyone any good at the present since only USB-2 ports exists on these models.  And yes, I realize some people have never heard of FW and to them, this is no big deal.  Although, part of the power, and reliability of a Mac, is the fact you can make an exact, bootable clone of your hard drive, and within minutes of a major hardware failure, be up and running, and continue to do your work, while your hard drive is being replaced.  This is a powerful feature that some people will never know until it's too late.  Granted, you can basically do the same from a USB drive, but if anyone has ever had to do so, they know how excruciatingly slow it is.  And of course USB cannot duplicate the functions of TDM.These new MacBooks will find buyers, there's no doubt that for many people they will be just what they need, and again, they are gorgeous and probably very durable.  But people that depended on FW and have an investment in FW devices, will need to think long and hard about this upgrade.  Also, I would recommend anyone wanting to purchase, to visit the Apple store and examine the LCD display for themselves.Although a minor complaint, I don't like the fact Apple makes you purchase the $1600 upgrade in order to get a lighted keyboard, that's as bad as the \"black\" tax (the black MacBooks costing more).  Using three stars as an \"average\" upgrade, I'm only giving this upgrade two stars because I feel Apple took too much away in relation for the price they are charging. This is unusual for me, since Apple products usually get my highest praise.  If this were a new product line, without anything to compare it to, perhaps it would be different.  But, the plastic MacBook continues to be the better deal for us at this point, although we will continue to evaluate them and see if perhaps Apple decides to release another revision with some improvements.1/31/09 Update:For those on a budget, and those who can live without the unibody design, but still wants / needs a MacBook, I encourage you to check out the newest refresh of the white MacBook.  They have made some substantial upgrades but have still kept the price down to what is, I think, a very affordable, but high-quality laptop from Apple.  We recently purchased ten of these and have been very happy with them.  The performance upgrade is very noticeable, and we can still use our FireWire peripherals and display adapters.  Since we are still using our original evaluation units together with our older models, we have also noticed better Wi-Fi reception on the polycarbonate models, as have other users.  But, in fairness, I will say, other than a couple of issues (mainly with DisplayPort adapters and the trackpad), the new MacBooks have performed well for us, and we have not had any major issues with them.You can find more info here:[...]Display update:5/29/09As I noted, the screen on the MacBook is just terrible.  It appears Apple has updated the MacBook's display because of complaints.From ARS:  \"Apple looks to have quietly replaced the LCD screen it was using on the unibody MacBook with an improved part. The updated screens began showing up in MacBooks made since the end of April, according to a report from Computerworld.\"June 8th 09 update:  In spite of those who criticized my review for my opinion on Firewire and the display.  Today, WWDC announced the MacBook PRO 13\", which replaces this model.  It has the better display, same type as used in the 15\", AND, now includes Firewire 800.  With even more features, and at a cheaper price, we'll be purchasing some for evaluation, and I think it's now time for me to upgrade from my 1st Gen White Macbook that has served me very well.  I hope to write a new review on this much needed upgrade.", "Date": "October 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "First time Mac user loves the Macbook", "Author": "Mermaid", "ReviewID": "R1KVHHEDTRQ1X8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband decided a laptop computer would be my anniversary/Christmas gift this year and he suggested I take a look at the Macbook because of all the photography and other artistic things I like to do on the computer.I read the reviews on Amazon and it seemed to me either the reviewer loved it and made no mention of \"firewire\" - something I had never heard of - or the reviewer gave negative reviews and was mentioning \"firewire\" or the lack thereof in the new MacBook.After my online research we went to our local Apple store to talk to a MacNerd in person and see the MacBook live and in action.  The techy was super knowledgeable, didn't talk techy, and helped me figure out exactly what I needed from my computer.  He didn't upsell me at all.  I asked him about this \"firewire\" and essentially it boiled down to the fact that I didn't care or need firewire as all it was is that previous Macs had it so that you could hook your computer up to another Mac with this technology and basically move files/applications from one computer to another without a hitch.  Given that I didn't have another Mac nor had I ever executed such a task, I wasn't worried about the lack of firewire.I ended up with what I called the \"entry level\" Macbook...the one with 160GB, as I already have a 500 GB external hard drive that is fortunately compatible with both my PC desktop and my new Mac (a MyBook).  I got a free printer/scanner all-in-one (after rebate), and I also purchased the Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Excel software as I just couldn't let go of that.  I felt that the iPhoto software that comes with the MacBook was sufficient and if for some reason I needed more I could just use the photo imaging software that I have on my desktop (or always upgrade to Aperature if I felt the need).  I also got a cool, snazzy little laptop bag.  I was nervous that I would not acclimate to the touchpad, so we also purchased a wireless mouse.  After everything was said in done, we spent $1800, but will be getting a $100 rebate check in the mail for the printer/scanner, so it will end up being $1700.Since yesterday I've fiddled around and played with the new features and have been exploring in my MacBook.  I haven't even opened my wireless mouse packaging yet --- my first frustration was not properly figuring out how to scroll with my touchpad or \"right click\" - a quick search on Apple's website under the Support menu helped me figure those out.  I might end up returning the wireless mouse after all.The battery so far is good and the first charge went pretty fast!I've had zero problems with the display being too reflective.  I've used it with a dark wall behind me as well as a big sliding glass door with lots of natural light and again, there was no problem at all.  I haven't had to adjust my color/contrast settings at all, so whatever it was set to \"out of the box\" has been perfect.  The only time there is a glare from the natural light was when I stopped using the MacBook a few minutes and it went \"idle\" as the screen darkens a bit which reflected the light a lot.  As soon as I began using it again, though, the brightness went right back to normal and I saw perfectly.My guilty pleasure right now is playing with the built in camera and putting funky backgrounds behind me where I get to pretend I'm at a beach, in Paris, or up floating with some clouds in the sky!  My kids get a kick out of sitting on my lap in front of the MacBook and turning the background into a roller coaster.  The background actually moves so it appears we're sitting in a roller coaster seat!Granted I've had my new toy for less than 24 hours, but I couldn't be happier with the purchase!", "Date": "November 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "This aluminum MacBook is a winner", "Author": "John Galt", "ReviewID": "R1TKMYNL9TJ8AS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this aluminum MacBook to replace the white plastic MacBook I acquired in June of 2006. I enjoyed using my white plastic MacBook, but when I learned about the manufacturing process used to construct the new aluminum MacBook, I realized it was time for an upgrade!I have read the unenthusiastic reviews despairing the removal of a Firewire port in the aluminum MacBook. I certainly understand that to some people Firewire connectivity is essential. I am not one of those people. I have never used the Firewire port in my white plastic MacBook. I guess I'm just behind the times; I don't even own a video camera.I have also read the negative comments about the glossy screen. I like the glossy screen because everything looks a little sharper as compared to the matte screen of my white plastic MacBook.The new MacBook has a glorious aluminum case and the computer is significantly faster than my 1.83Ghz 2gb RAM white plastic MacBook.This machine is a winner..", "Date": "November 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "firewire / other thoughts", "Author": "matblinks", "ReviewID": "RM2M67IE4H7PM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "*edit* this was not supposed to be a full review - just a heads up so you know about the firewire issue (and the impact it may have on you directly) before you purchase it.  it seems now this issue is widely known anyway, but i think at least here you can decide for yourself as to whether it is the be all and end all or just another feature that would have been cool if it was left in.  also note this mac's hard drive is insanely easy to replace, so if your drive was on it's way out, you could replace it, reinstall the os, and put your failing hdd into a usb enclosure (which could cost the same as a firewire cable) to attempt to recover data.  i also put in another paragraph or two at the end on other first impressions.the only thing i would like to add to the the current reviews is that the firewire port was dropped on the macbook models (not the pros though).  this is the only thing that worries me because of the inability for the computer to take advantage of target disk mode.  you may never have used it before, but it's one of those features that set apart macs from everything else.  booting the mac holding the letter 't' will make it boot to target disk (a large firewire symbol will float on the screen).  then connecting to another mac with a firewire cable will make it show up on the other mac's desktop just like any external drive would.  this is perfect for transferring files quickly and easily, also a great troubleshooting step if the mac will not boot, as it may boot to target disk, allowing you to recover files to another mac before replacing the hard drive if it's on it's way out - it may not boot normally, but may boot to target disk (note, if the mac will not boot but you are sure it's not a hardware issue, you can just do an archive and install, reinstalling your operating system while keeping your files).another reason many people have used it is for account migrating if upgrading from another mac.  migration assistant now uses ethernet, so you are still set here.if you own a camcorder - please make sure it supports usb 2.0, too, unless you are in the market for a new one of those too.oh - and i have a feeling all this firewire business might have something to do with usb 3.0 - which it looks like we will be seeing crop up in devices next year.just wanted to make sure you are aware of this before you make your decision!ok, so the 'another paragraph or two on other first impressions' - firstly, don't think that anyone could give you a reasonable review of a product that just came out a few days ago.  customer reviews are by far the most important thing i look at when deciding to buy something, but please bear in mind that you don't have the awesome posts by people who have actually owned the product more than five minutes yet.  anyway - so the screen - personally i like it, and yes, sometimes i can see the light fixture's reflection behind me when i'm powering up.  the blacks also look a little faded as per some reviews, but then again, the screen border is jet black, and i wonder if that makes it appear worse than it actually is.  also, when looking at an angle, mine looks ok left to right - even at the tightest angle, although not so much if i am looking at the screen from above.  i say 'ok' because it's not perfect (colours seem to darken a little), but then again, i'm really not going to be watching a movie from 10 feet away at a 45 degree angle on a 13.3 inch screen.  but that's just me - it's the way i roll, evidently.i'd recommend trying it out if you can at an apple store - see for yourself, understand that people can be really upset if they spend a lot of money and it doesn't work as *perfectly* as they expect it to, and that also the opposite is true - that people need their decisions reinforced and may tend to leave shinier than normal reviews.  my own 5 star rating?  four for the product and an extra one as it's apple makes five.  honestly though i love it but there could be improvements.  the pronounced edges make my wrists a little sore.  also it's about getting used to a smaller screen than my last notebook had (not apple's fault, but i am sure many people might have this issue).  no firewire may suck in the future, but right now it's not an issue.  deciding how to replace roboform with something mac compatible is my biggest nightmare (again that's not on apple).that's it! hope it helps!", "Date": "October 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Mostly improvements, but a few flaws...", "Author": "Adam Dachis \"adachis\"", "ReviewID": "RCIS69GDHU76X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'd been waiting for these laptops since the introduction of Intel processors in Macs.  The MacBook Pros used nearly the exact same case design for far too long.  While I didn't think the MacBooks really needed a design refresh, I like the choices Apple made so much that I bought one.  I like having a smaller laptop, though I do appreciate some of the additional features you get with a MacBook Pro.  That said, many of the extra bells and whistles once left out of the MacBooks have found their way in and while I never really thought I'd care I have to say--it makes a huge difference.Owning a new aluminum MacBook is a lot more like owning one of the old 12\" Powerbooks.  I used to have one and it was wonderful.  It's probably the one discontinued Apple computer that's coveted by its owners.  Their resale value is still fairly high, considering how comparatively slow they are.  If you're a blogger or a writer and you don't use the machine for much else, it's sort of a best of breed.  However, with these new aluminum MacBooks I think things have changed.  You get a backlit keyboard in the higher end model (which is the one I'm reviewing), an aluminum body (of course), and a multitouch trackpad.  I think the backlit keyboard is the nicest addition.  It's really something you appreciate more once you've used it.  I've never had any difficulty typing in the dark but I can't see myself ever buying a machine without a backlit keyboard again.  It's incredibly helpful when you need to type a special character or press a function button.  If you don't have the usual key positions memorized, I imagine it's even better.  This makes the high end MacBook feel a lot more like a MacBook Pro.Regarding the aluminum unibody Apple likes to talk about so highly, it's very nice.  While they did this with the Macbook Air, it seems much more refined with the new MacBooks and MacBook Pros.  My one complaint, which I feel will fade over time, is that it sometimes looks too perfect.  I don't mean this as a backhanded compliment, but that there is such a thing as being so perfect it lacks a human touch.  Think about listening to a computer play a song versus a human.  It's just not as good.  Well, technically the computer is better but that human touch is relevant to us.  This machine is so exact and precise that it sometimes feels inhuman.  At the same time, it is rather stunning.  I think I'll get past the lack of human imperfections as I get used to looking at it each day.The multitouch trackpad is something I'm not foreign to, as I used a MacBook Air for awhile.  The new trackpad space is identical.  I found this very fortunate as I don't like buying new machines without being able to get a Marware Protection Pack as well.  Luckily I bought a MacBook Air pack and it fit perfectly.  Even the trackpad film fit.  While multitouch gestures didn't make their way into my regular routine too often, I did use them here and there and am glad they now exist throughout Apple's line of laptops.  The disadvantage of the new trackpad is the lack of a button.  Yes, the whole trackpad is a button and yes it's very clickable.  The problem is that sometimes the click doesn't register.  I turned on single and double taps for left click and right click (respectively), but sometimes those don't register as well.  If this were my first Apple laptop, I'd panic and run to the Genius Bar for help.  Since I've been through a few of these, I've found that it takes a month or two before you really break in the button.  I've had the laptop for about ten days now and it's already working better.  Still, I wish it just clicked as expected out of the box.  For those that are wondering how you click and drag if there's no actual button, you just kind of pretend there is a button.  While Apple gives you the entire trackpad for tracking, and you can click pretty much anywhere (with resistance building more and more as you move upwards), you can expect this trackpad to work just like the MacBook Air's trackpad.  The space where the Air's button would be is where you can safely rest a thumb (or whatever) for clicking.  It will not register as a second finger as easily.  If you pretend there is a button at the bottom of the trackpad, you'll quickly forget there isn't one.But those are the bells and whistles.  As far as performance goes, there's not much excitement in regards to speed.  The computer's architecture has changed, but the Core 2 Duo processors aren't really much faster (or any faster as the case may be here).  The big jump is in the new graphics processor from NVIDIA.  I'm not going to pretend to be a hardcore gamer.  I don't play many games, and especially not when it comes to those that are GPU-intensive.  I can't give you frame rates from World of Warcraft or anything like that.  What I can tell you is that the new NVIDIA graphics make for smoother performance around the operating system and seem to contribute to 1) better battery life and 2) a cooler system.One of my favorite things about this laptop is that it doesn't really get hot.  I ran an H.264 video encode today so I could put a video on my iPhone and it didn't feel hot at all.  The MacBook Air heats up in about five seconds and then cripples the GPU first, before throttling anything else, and gets pretty warm.  You could iron a shirt with the old MacBooks and I won't even start with the MacBook Pros.  I can't believe how cool this machine has been.  I'm not punishing it with endless work, but for it to make it through a twelve minute video encode without breaking a sweat is pretty amazing.  It's the first time I've used an Apple laptop and didn't worry about becoming sterile.  I don't know what they did, but it's wonderful.I get about four hours of battery life under normal usage.  While this still doesn't quite match what Apple promises, it's the highest I've ever, realistically, gotten out of an Apple laptop.  I'm more than happy with four hours.  I rarely use my laptop off of the power adapter anyhow.Another neat feature of the new MacBooks (and MacBook Pros) is that you can use your iPhone/iPod touch stereo headset with microphone to record (crappy) audio and have basic control over iTunes.  Since I swap my iPhone headphones out of the iPhone and into the laptop very frequently, this is fantastic.  I can't tell you how many times I've been interrupted and clicked the microphone on the headset to pause the song, only to remember that I can't.  Now I can.  This is wonderful.So far I've only had good things to say and that's because, overall, this is an excellent machine.  I want to talk about a few bad things, however.  In my opinion, the biggest flaw is the display.  This is why I've rated it a four and not a five.  The display is an embarrassment.  If you have any intention of doing any visual work that actually matters, this machine will be completely useless to you.  The viewing angle is so terrible that no matter where you are, you will not get even contrast.  I don't notice it quite as much when I'm surfing the web or just writing, but when I watch a video it's very apparent.  If you do visual work and it's not just for fun, do not buy this machine.  Get a MacBook Pro where it's not an issue.  Even the old MacBooks have better displays.  I don't do visual work on this machine for that reason.  If it's not critical, I might, but for the most part I work on my desktop machine instead.Another downside about the display is that it's glossy.  These look cool and all, but the reflections are obnoxious when you can't easily avoid them and you don't get very accurate color or contrast.  This is a fault of the panel itself, too, but the glossiness just ruins it further.  For general use, this isn't a big deal.  If you want to color correct or design, Apple has pretty much opted to screw you over regardless of how much you decide to spend on their hardware.  Matte screens are just not going to be an option anymore.  I think this is a stupid choice, because the people who kept Apple alive are the designers who chose Macs early on in Apple's history.  The loyalists are generally not fond of glossy screens and have been vocal about it.  I think having an option is fine, but forcing people to use glossy screens is awful.  Being a loyalist and needing a matte screen, I've just started using my laptop for everything but color critical work.  It's allowed me to prefer working on a smaller screen, which is nice because it means less computer to cart around.  I've been able to work around this problem, but my situation allowed for it.  It's still a big problem for a lot of people who can't defer to a desktop.The other disadvantage is a lack of Firewire.  While I rarely employed Firewire in my laptops, especially after using the MacBook Air (which has none), I still liked having it around.  I don't really miss that it's gone.  Again, this is primarily due to having a desktop companion that can connect with just about anything.  Whether or not this is a major issue is really up to the individual.  If you know you need it, you have your answer.  Personally, I wish Apple would've kept it until they had something better to replace it with.  Maybe they couldn't fit it into the new, slimmer casing.  I would just like to see a USB 2.0 alternative, since USB 2.0 doesn't quite live up to its claims.When it comes to upgrades and replacements, this machine gets a little better and a little worse.  If you're upgrading from a MacBook Pro to a MacBook Pro, you're getting easier upgrades all around.  If you're used to upgrades in a MacBook, however, I'd say things are better and worse.  If you want to replace RAM, you have to remove the bottom case.  It's not that hard to do but it means keeping track of quite a few screws and exposing the entirety of your machine's innards.  If you're simply replacing the hard drive, however, you can pretty much just yank it out.  One of the first things I did is replace the hard drive with a solid state disk.  They're getting cheaper and you can get a 120GB or 128GB drive for much less than what Apple offers.  But on the plus side, if you do want your computer to come with an SSD you now have that option as a custom order.  While in tests SSD hasn't really proven to have too many benefits, in real world practice it makes the machine feel much snappier.  For that reason, having an SSD is worth it.Apple's RAM upgrade prices are also not as terrible as they used to be.  At least, it seems that way.  A RAM upgrade through a third party only saves $10-20.  When spending a lot of money on a new machine, I think many people would choose the convenience over the comparatively small savings that come with doing it yourself.Anyway, that pretty much covers the majority of the relevant pros and cons of the new MacBook.  So far I love it.  I think it's a wonderfully made machine.  It's sturdy, it's attractive and it works really well.

While it is reasonable to wish other features were available or to feel the price is too high, it is ludicrous to rate this laptop a \"1\" as some have done.Take the screen issue for instance. I spent an hour at the apple store before purchasing this laptop comparing the display to that of the MacBook Pro. Back and forth I went, playing sample video after sample video, looking from different viewing angles, trying to see what the complaint was. I'm sorry, maybe my eyes are not so good for that sort of thing, but I just didn't see that big a difference. I'm not saying there is no difference and I do think the MacBook Pro looked a little better. But I would in no way characterize the display as bad or washed out.As far as the glossy display...it is reflective as are most new laptops these days. However, the LED display is so bright that even in the sunlight (as is the case as I type this ) I can see the screen perfectly well. I know many people prefer the matte screen, especially photo buffs. Perhaps Apple will bring the matte back as an option. I think the display is VERY good and much improved over my last macbook...much brighter.The fit and finish of this laptop is outstanding! It really does feel like a solid block of metal with absolutely no \"flexing\" when holding in one hand. I have never had a laptop, PC or Mac, that felt like it was put together so well. It is just a beautifully designed notebook with clean, simple lines as opposed to some notebooks I've seen that are almost garish with the colors and flashing lights.I chose the 2.4 Ghz Model over the 2.0 GHz Macbook. While this increased the price by $ 300 +/- , the faster processor, larger hardrive, and backlit keyboard was worth it to me. I really like the backlit keyboard as I am often working with the lights down. If those things are not important to you, save yourself $ 300 and get the 2.0 GHz. You really won't notice much difference in speed.On the other hand, if a somewhat better and larger 15.4 \"display, and a discreet graphics card for more demanding tasks ( such as gaming ) are important, you may prefer the MacBook Pro. I may have gone this way myself but I personally prefer the smaller screen as it is easier to travel with and use on a plane.The price? Too high? Perhaps so if you do not feel that the Mac OS is for you. One can certainly buy a VERY fast and feature rich PC for less than the price of the MacBook. However, for a marginally higher investment, I feel I have a very well made and extremely functional notebook that I don't need to worry about.", "Date": "November 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "A step closer towards perfection", "Author": "P. Tan", "ReviewID": "R35GHZGX1PNEAT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A beautiful and stunning notebook both inside and out. I can not even begin to tell you how passionate I am about this device since the day I got it. The Unibody Macbook is generations ahead when compared to equivalent notebooks with similar specifications. There are countless reviews out there so in this review I would like to share with you the little things that are often overlooked, yet can make an impact to your buying decisions.Hardware:Build and design - Unlike the polycarbonate version, the unibody clearly feels solid. It is not a marketing gimmick and by far the most solid notebook you'll ever pick up. Lenovos were traditionally viewed as the 'tough' book class for business environments but the unibody manufacturing process has changed my view completely. (Although not recommended), there is virtually no flex picking up and holding the unibody by the edges.Turn the macbook over and all you find is a clean and well presented underside. There are no ugly FCC stickers, no Windows COA stickers. International and Bluetooth certifications? Intel inside stickers? Nope. Although some of these regulations are required to be displayed, the bare minimum is etched onto the back cover as a monochrome type instead. I have seen countless laptops being scarred left right and center with all sorts of horrendous stickers both on the palm rest and the back. To complete, there only 4 visible screws flushed against the aluminum back cover and actually the only ones you'll ever find on the entire notebook. The remainder is hidden underneath the battery latch. When was the last time you counted the number of screws on your laptop? The unibody incorporates 'defensive design' - should you find the need to open up the notebook to upgrade the memory, you will notice that there are strategically assigned magnetic areas which catch these screws if you accidentally dropped them in the process.I had been tearing apart trying to decide whether a backlit keyboard (2.0ghz vs 2.4ghz model) deemed necessary for the extra cost. The processor and hard drive upgrade was insignificant but I had no regrets going for a model with a backlit keyboard. I am a touch typer yet I still find it helps considerably especially during low lighting situations such as being on a plane, checking mails first thing at dawn where you would find yourself typing passwords or quick email replies in these low lighting situations.Around the notebook, you'll notice that battery indicator on the side - No point having it at the bottom where the battery is if it means you have to turn it over to find out. This is extremely helpful when you are in the middle of a full screen presentation. There are no annoying or blinking indicator LEDs that you find on other notebooks. With exception of the sleep indicator just to the left of the infra red receiver. In fact, it is not even visible at all until it is actually indicating sleep mode. There are no latches to get your business/long sleeve shirt caught onto and the lid shuts with a solid thud which got me to believe that to even produce that kind of sound, it requires all edges of the lid to come into contact with the base all at the same time.All connectors/ports have been assigned to the left side of the notebook, a feature I find that many other notebooks lack - For example, I tend to use wireless but on occasion fall back on Ethernet LAN, with the previous notebooks I owned I had to look left, right and behind to locate ports which I do not frequent. The unibody design meant that every port you'll need is always in one side of the notebook. Also keeps your desk tidy rather than having cables running in every direction out from the notebook.The fan is extraordinarily quiet when in operation. I would hear the hard drive spinning over the centrifugal fan. Vents are placed at the top of the notebook between the keyboard and the display. This is critical because with most notebooks I find they tend to draw air from the side (or worse at the bottom) of the notebook which meant that dust could get drawn inside the unit.It is not widely known that the speakers have actually been upgraded from the previous polycarbonate version. It even boasts a mini subwoofer but do not expect it to perform miracles.The multi touch trackpad is a joy to use once you get accustomed to it. There have been plenty of criticisms, both positive and negative about this however I found it did not take me long to realize that I am far more productive using it daily without requiring a dedicated external mouse. It is highly configurable and even does right clicks for those skeptics out there, and my advise is to kick the habit of physically pushing down for a left/right click and instead use the multi touch capability to distinguish between the two. Try it out at an Apple Retail Store.A review is never complete with negative comments however it is impossibly difficult to expose the faults of the Unibody Macbook. My only concern was the poor LED display quality when viewing at an angle - colors appear washed out when viewed at an angle - something which Apple has addressed recently with a silent upgrade. Mentioned by others, the glass display does attract fingerprints but it is nothing too strange about any Apple device in the first place. The lack of firewire ports seemed to be a strategic decision for potential buyers to consider the 15\" pro cousin instead.In conclusion, Apple has once again redefined the standard of notebooks and made me accept nothing less in terms of design and quality from a notebook manufacturer. Apple has always made great devices and other manufacturers can make great things too. For the latter, sadly that is still not entirely the case. The unibody macbook may not be the device for everyone, but it is certainly a notebook that made a right step towards perfection. I hope after reading this you are able to take away some of the insights that I found to have contributed towards the joy of using it everyday.", "Date": "May 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Hardcore PC guy giving Mac a chance...", "Author": "Techie \"WDC\"", "ReviewID": "R135CDOLUM4ZWF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "FIRST IMPRESSIONS:I had to give up my HP laptop so I saw this as an opportunity to try out the new Macbook. Granted, it was a few hundred $ more than an equivalent PC but I really don't mind paying extra for quality - and without a doubt, quality was what I got. I've checked it out quite a few times at the Apple Stores prior to making my purchase but for some reason I was a lot more impressed after getting one and having hands-on with it for a few days. The unibody gives it a very solid feel and the build-quality is un-comparable by any PCs that I've seen/used. This is a work of art. I find myself wiping it obsessively on a daily basis and I would leave it on top of my desk just to show it off. The magnetic \"Magsafe\" power cord is genius as I've already kicked it off a few times.THE SETUP:I've never used a Mac before and was a little bit hesitant so I Boot Camped it and installed Windows 7 Beta on it. The installation went flawlessly. All the drivers were included on the CD. Just to test out the 9400M capabilities, I installed Far Cry 2 and Prince of Persia to see how it would run. Well, let's just say it runs ok when set close to the lowest graphic settings but the machine heated up pretty quickly. So if you're a hard core gamer this is probably not for you... But to just play a little bit here and there to kill some time it's pretty ideal (or pop in an older game). Far Cry 2 reported that \"My vdo drivers are too old please update\" but newer drivers are nowhere to be found. So perhaps with a drivers update it'll get better, we'll see. I also installed 2 older games, Jade Empire Special Edition and Fable the Lost Chapters. Both runs very nicely at the highest res and AA x2 (medium detail etc). Nvidia drivers does not support this Chipset and Apple does not offer updates for it, quite frustrating.OS X / USER EXPERIENCE:As for using the OS X. It did take me a little time to learn it and get used to it. Being technically savvy, I was able to figure everything out within a day or two. The first epiphany came when I realized that I can forever do away with the mouse (except when gaming or using Photoshop). This extra large track pad is very intuitive. One finger tap to click, 2 finger tap to right-click, 1-finger double-tap to drag, two finger motion to scroll/zoom/rotate, 3 finger swipe to browse, 4 finger swipe to select a different running app... etc., I never knew so much can be done with just 4 fingers. The MAC OS X is much easier to use than Windows. Everything you need is VERY easy to access and everything else that you MIGHT need is minimized. Spaces - Very cool concept. I set all my chat clients (MSN, iChat, Skype) to one space (desktop) and work stuff on another. Simple tapping switches from one space to the next. There's this other thing where you can set all the corners of your screen to have different functions. Shooting my pointer all the way to the upper-right turns off the screen. Perfect when I'm browsing in bed and it's the last thing I do right before passing out. Powering on and off is extremely fast - Much faster than Windows (Powers off in 5sec). Battery life seems exceptionally better compared to Windows (on the same machine), which tells me that OS X is probably much better optimized. Good 4 hours of usage prior to drain, something that I can only dream of on my previous laptop. The led battery indicator lights up at a touch of a button even when the power is off to give you a quick juice status. Resuming from sleep mode, the WIFI connects instantly without problems (even if it's waking up to a new network).THE CONS:... You guessed it, the crazy glare on the screen...

Although, I have lusted after Mac OS for years, it wasn't practical because most of my work software is Windows. Now, the ability to run Windows on Mac notebooks has changed that and it is possible to have the best of both worlds. Amongst the Windows notebooks, ThinkPad has always been my favorite, and this MacBook is replacing ThinkPad X31.MacBook is fast, feels very solid and sturdy, thin and has bright LED display with vivid colors and fast graphics. Some people are complaining about the glossy screen; but I found glare a problem only with bright light facing the screen. Battery life is decent, about 4 hours. Self adjusting screen brightness, depending upon ambient light, does not work very well and I had to turn it off. Backlit keyboard is excellent. You will like large multi-touch track pad after you get used to it. Two finger scrolling and right click are very convenient. In lot of ways Mac OS is superior than Windows, and especially Vista. Mac OS applications are lot more fun and easier to use, not to mention less crashes, freezes and viruses and malware.Being a migrant from Windows, I miss dedicated PgDn and PgUp keys; it also lacks numLk, Home, End, and Del (forward) keys. Lack of Firewire can be a problem if you do not have another computer with one and need to use it for camcorder etc. Card reader is also absent and it is not easy to transfer camera pictures unless the camera also works as a card reader. Neither is there an express card slot or 3G modem. Cost is definitely a lot more than similarly equipped Windows notebooks. Mac versions of Quicken, Quickbooks, Dragon speech and several others programs are not as good as Windows versions which I have been using under Windows and Fusion. Theoretically you can use Windows on the MacBook but in practice many files saved in one operating system cannot be opened by the other operating system. For example, Windows cannot open many of my photos, documents and spreadsheets saved in MacBook (\"Disk read error\"). Potential Windows migrants really ought to look before they leap into the Mac OS.I feel the ideal weight for a truly mobile computer should be 2-3 lbs and screen 12 inches. 13.3 inch screen has a big footprint and 4.5 lbs is slightly heavy. MacBook Air is not as powerful, is expensive, has smaller hard drive and lacks ports. And the main reason to get MacBook Pro is if you need firewire port and do lot of graphics intensive work. I loved my  ThinkPad X31 with 12.4 inch screen, 3 lb weight and all the ports. For me the ideal computer would have been a ThinkPad X200 with Mac OS; I figured that in absence of that, this MacBook could be the next best choice. But so far, I have mixed feelings about trading ThinkPad for MacBook.", "Date": "October 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very Poor Display (Beware)", "Author": "Charles", "ReviewID": "R2DXQ1LC3XO4XV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I just got my new Aluminum MacBook last night, and it's going right back for refund this morning. The LCD is far inferior to my 1st generation MacBook display, and it's actually one of the worst displays I've seen on a modern notebook computer. I've been an Apple owner since I bought an SE/30, but Apple has screwed up badly here, and I find the new MacBook nearly unusable. (Please note, my current MacBook has a glossy screen; that level of glossiness is not the issue here.)UPDATE: I just got back from the Apple Store (refund accomplished), and one of the staff at the store (a photographer) helped me compare my old MacBook with this new Aluminum MacBook and the new MacBook Pro. All of the new MacBooks on display had the same issues: blacks not really black, colors less vibrant, and overall contrast lower than the old MacBook. The new MacBook Pro, however, does not have these issues (although the screen is still a bit more blue than the old MacBook; not as blue as new MacBook). The Apple Store staffer agreed that the new MacBook screen is not great. He also much preferred the old one (or the new MacBook Pro). An online review at gizmodo dot com (gizmodo.com/5063492/macbook-and-macbook-pro-dual-review) clearly shows the same problems that I describe here.The issues:1. The whole screen has an icky blue cast, and nothing in the display calibration settings will fix this (I tried for over an hour). My old MacBook has a much more pure and natural looking white. I think Apple needs to work more on the LED back-lighting for the new MacBook (or maybe they cheaped out on the MacBook LEDs).2. The blacks on the new display are washed out (this used to be a problem with LCD televisions and can still occur with cheap LCDs). This is obvious on the start-up animation (with the multi-lingual \"welcome\" messages against the Leopard nebulae in space). It's not just an issue with solid black images, however: this propagates to everything looking less crisp. And it's not an issue of adjusting brightness or screen angle. In fact, if you try to adjust the screen angle to get some reasonably good blacks, you get parts of the screen where you have a metallic or posterized effect. I saw this in the store displays as well, but I didn't realize that it would occur under normal viewing angles vs. extreme situations. This is also clearly shown in the gizmodo review referenced above.3. Colors are not vibrant (nothing compared to my 1st generation MacBook). By not vibrant, I mean that different hues of blue, for example, are not distinct from one another. When I open Word, the splash screen has four different blue colors in the \"feather\" shape at the top right. On the old MacBook the blues are distinctly different and colorful, on the new MacBook they are much closer in hue and more dull. I think this is a result primarily of issues one and two above, but it may also have to do with other aspects of the inferior LCD on the Aluminum MacBook.4. The new MacBook screen should be called \"mirrored\" not \"glossy\". My 1st generation MacBook has a glossy screen. It's good. I rarely have an issue with visible reflections from it. The new MacBook is a constant battle. One major problem is that the screen needs to be pushed farther back to get reasonable contrast, but this angle directly reflects ceiling lights at the user. It's also so significantly more reflective than the previous glossy screen that it picks up windows and floor lamps and everything else a lot more easily. It's a mess.I hope this helps other folks avoid my mistake in seeking to upgrade from an existing MacBook. The new one does not feel any faster in day to day use (3D rendering excepted), and it has crippling issues with the display. I would strongly encourage anyone with a current MacBook to take it to the store with you and check out the Aluminum MacBook display for yourself before buying.", "Date": "October 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Too expensive for what it is", "Author": "Traveller \"Where in the world are you today?\"", "ReviewID": "R2PFI4PFUM4XCB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Briefly:The good:(1) Aluminum body feels sturdy and solid(2) Liking the new pad, wish it didn't have the effect, don't like the friction of the surface (move your finger over the touchpad vs the aluminum body)(3) Mac OS X :)(4) Form factor.

Everyone has been laughing and quoting it and telling me I have to see it, and when I finally get around to it, I think \"Oh . . . but it's just a movie.\" After about six months of researching and being sold on Macs, I thought \"Oh . . . but it's just a computer.\" It was a sad moment when I realized it wasn't going to change my life. I suppose as sort of a non-computer person, I was seduced into expecting it to hold me when I cried and make me breakfast in the morning. It doesn't do either one of those things.I'm happy to say that I've grown quite fond of my Mac, after a fashion, even though it consistently refuses to do my dishes and hasn't actually changed my life. I will probably never be the Mac culty I thought I might become, but I don't see myself going back to Windows. I've sipped the kool-aid and found it delicious refreshing.Some things I like:-It doesn't come loaded with a lot of useless stuff you'll never use; the applications that do come installed are things you're going to use, or at least want to play with.-Leopard is really easy to use, and it's incredibly attractive. (I'll be a geek and admit I love the genie-in-the-bottle effect when minimizing something to the dock.)-The \"Scrabble tile\" keyboard is really nice and looks sleek.-The whole system and the unit are simple. There aren't extraneous lights, buttons, etc; everything does what it looks like it's going to do, and it doesn't look like an airport landing strip.-The backlit keyboard is actually really useful; I wasn't sure it would be.-The trackpad with all the gestures isn't as \"gimmicky\" as I'd read; the 3-finger forward and backward, and 4-finger expose features are really useful (though the 3-finger gestures don't work in every application).-Finding files is so easy, and it's actually led me to be more organized in my saving of work; Time Machine works incredibly well--I can't remember a single successful backup of my Windows computer, ever. That's not Mac-freak speak; it's true.-It's light and compact and I don't need a special bag to put it in, I can fit the adapter and the notebook in my backpack.-The battery life, while not quite as good as advertised, is miles above what I'm used to.-Office for Mac isn't as bad as a lot of the reviews I read say it is; I actually like it and find it simpler and easier to use than the Windows version. It did take some adjustment, though.Some things I don't like:-It is beautiful, but it's a scratch magnet. Aluminum is a soft metal, and within days I had three or four noticeable scratches that I can't trace the origin of. I broke down and put on a see-through Speck case for it, because my OCD was kicking in. I hated the case at first, but it's ultimately not that bad--aside from the dust that collects in the front, bottom corners. I just feel as though something that costs this much should stay pristine longer.-Screenshots, which probably isn't a common practice for most people, is sort of complex.-Shortcuts take some getting used to. Using \"command\" in place of \"alt\" for Word shortcuts is a big change--and when I go back to work to use a Windows computer, I make mistakes doing that, too.-I'm not yet sold on \"Mail\" and \"iCal\" being better than Outlook. One of the reasons I was sold on the Mac was the \"Mail\" feature of Notes and To-Dos--this feature has actually not worked correctly once. When I talked to AppleCare, they told me most people don't use that feature and so they don't have much information about it. About 3 or 3 weeks later, I'm still waiting for word on what's wrong with it. It's minor, clearly, as most people aren't using it, but I was annoyed.-Finally, there's what my friend calls \"Mac fear.\" Essentially, the terror that comes with realizing you've spent a huge amount of money on a notebook and that it could get stolen or somehow damaged. I never really worried about that before. AppleCare protection plans and LoJack for Laptops alleviate the fear, but not much.Ultimately I like the Mac a lot, and I'm glad I made the switch. As someone who works full time and also goes to school online full time, I find that it's important to have a computer I don't mind sitting in front of and lugging around with me everywhere. That's the Mac. If you're interested and can afford it, go for it. But, if, like me, you had a relatively new notebook and you were wondering if you should give in and replace it, I'd say hang on for a while. At the end of the day, it's just a computer.

I am a longtime Mac user and have used them for everything from graphic design work to simple college papers.  I recently upgraded to this Mac from an Ibook G4.  If you are intending to use this Mac for heavy graphic design and professional video editing then it may not be for you.  I would like to refute a few of the bad reviews people have given.1.) There is no firewire - This is apparent by simply looking at the laptop and thus if you use firewire often then don't buy it, this will save some time returning it.  Many average users do not need firewire and transferring files from an old Mac is still very easy with this new MacBook.2.)  Some have said the screen has a bluish tint or washed out look - I have not yet run into this problem.  Make sure your display's color settings are set to LCD color and you will have deep blacks and crisp whites.  The colors in this display are clearly vibrant and the new NVIDIA graphics card ensures that your images look beautiful.3.)  The glossy screen problem - Yes, the screen is glossy, but a simple adjustment of your viewing angle is all that needs to be done in order to lose the reflections.  This also aids in the vibrancy of blacks and whites.  Using the MacBook outside seems to give off more reflection so if you plan on using it outside you may want to purchase a matte screen film.  However, I have not had major problems with reflections.Overall this MacBook is solid upgrade for the average Mac user.

As such, this review largely covers improvements and differences between these two models. I understand that the older gen MacBooks are still available both new and secondhand, and as such many might be interested in knowing how they differ.Sheer performance wise, this machine is on par with my older MacBook. This is significant when you consider that I upgraded that one to the same amount of RAM (2 GB) and that it had a more powerful processor (2.2 ghz, as opposed to 2.0). For sheer crunching power, it's a very fast machine- made more so by the innate superiority of the Mac OS. Startup time is measured in seconds, and it is good to go in a heartbeat from sleep mode.The case design looks nicer, is less prone to scratching and discoloration, and is thinner and feels more solid. The whole package is lighter, and the screen seems to be improved as well (brighter in general, and sharper). Some customers have reported a lot of glare on the glossy display, but I haven't really noticed (admittedly, I'm known to not notice when my windshield is dirty either, though). The keyboard has a different feel to it than the previous one- less plastic and more rubbery. It makes less noise, but the general size, feel, and response is similar. I like it. The trackpad is now a 'glass' one piece pad, with no visible button. You push the bottom part to click, and can perform most iPhone-style multitouch input. It is a huge improvement over the old touchpad- far more responsive, especially when your fingers aren't perfectly dry. The surface feels much smoother as well, and it's easier to clean. One important thing to note: this 'low end' MacBook does not have the backlit keyboard. That's only in the high-end model. Personally, I don't really care- backlit KBs are more for show than function in my opinion, and it uses more battery power.I am a gamer, and as such I was particularly interested in the improved graphics suite on the new MacBook. My older one used an Intel integrated X3100 GPU. It was fine for things that were 2 or more years old, but let's just say you probably don't want to try playing Call of Duty 4 on it. I loaded up WoW on it and got from 10-20 FPS in most areas on the lowest settings. Not too hot. Right off, I can say that the new MacBook has greatly improved graphics performance (in the case of WoW, at least 20 FPS on medium settings). While it might be a stretch to say it has 5 times better performance (as noted in the spec sheet) the nVidia GF 9400M is certainly at least double the power of the old Intel integrated. I wouldn't recommend you replace your gaming rig with a vanilla MacBook- for that, you probably want a Pro at least- but it'll do in a pinch.The MacBook has a built-in camera and mic, and hidden speakers. All of them perform very well- I've used the camera and mic for videoconferencing, and they turn out as good a picture and quality as you'd expect out of any laptop. The speakers are good enough for movie playback; no complaints in that regard. As with the previous Macs, iLife suite and quite a few other tools are included, making the machine a true multimedia station right out of the box. The software is very intuitive and well designed.Input ports are perhaps the only concern for the MacBook. There's a headphone, mic jack, ethernet, mini-DVI, and 2 USB ports. Unlike the previous MacBook and the Pro, there's no FireWire port. There aren't any good solutions for adapting FireWire to fit a USB or ethernet port, so if you have older devices that can't use USB you might be out of luck. While the DVI port is nice and small, you need to buy adapter heads to use it with anything. The SuperDrive is as good as ever, and seems to make less noise loading and ejecting than previous incarnations. Apple Remote is an option that you have to pay extra for now; it was free with my old machine. I liked it, but don't really miss it. The MagSafe power adapter looks completely identical to my old one, even down to the somewhat mismatched polycarbonate white casing.Generally speaking, the new MacBook runs quiet and warm- rarely hot, and never along the entire case as the old one sometimes did. I frequently had the fan rev up to really high speed on my older machine, especially when viewing movies- this one handles it without so much as a whisper.In terms of modifiability, replacing or changing RAM is very similar to the old MacBook. Replacing the hard drive is even easier- it's literally right there by the battery when you open the battery cover, and you can pull it right out. Apple used to purposely make it really hard to upgrade or swap components; I'm glad they've decided to steer away from that rather frustrating doctrine.About the only major minus I've seen when comparing machines is battery life. The older MacBook definitely lasted longer and took less time to charge. I'm pretty sure this has something to do with the new graphics processor and perhaps some sort of logic board modifications (the older one was notorious for randomly failing). It is probably also why it tends to run cooler when plugged into AC power, which I think is a worthwhile tradeoff for slightly longer charge times.Warranty-wise, Apple is very solid for repairs under coverage. I had a logic board failure in my old machine, and had it replaced and ready for pickup within the same day at the local Apple store. Macs come with 1 year full coverage, extendable to 3 years. I recommend you purchase that warranty, and additionally- if you bought from a third party vendor like Amazon- make sure that they have your actual purchase date in their records. They often go from the sale date to the VENDOR, not to you, and that isn't really right or fair. Call AppleCare and they'll be glad to fix it for you.If you own an older MacBook, the question of upgrading is a bit tricky. I gave my white MacBook to a friend that needed a computer, so this was a replacement. If you're just shopping for upgrades, bear in mind that aside from style and video performance the new MacBook is not a great deal better than the old one. That said, the old one was pretty darn good as is, and if you're thinking of buying this as your first Mac or first Apple laptop, it comes with my highest recommendations. Frankly, there is no good reason not to choose a Mac over a Windows laptop, unless you simply can't afford one. Don't believe it? Go visit a local Apple store and see for yourself.

I was a bit reluctant to buy another Mac but I've had about enough of Windows Vista.I had been using a Sony VAIO with Vista for about a year before it started giving me guff. Certain music production applications (Ableton Live and Reason) would stall on start up and it would take me 3-5 time of ending the task and restarting the app before I could getting it running properly. These two programs were the only ones that had this issue. I tried reinstalling the programs but that solved nothing. I also had issues with a couple of the MS updates, IE updates and a .NET update would not install. After contacting MS tech support, they prescribed a complete Vista reinstall as a remedy. I thought that was a bit much just to install a couple of updates. These issues along with Vista's sluggish performance convinced me to give OS X another try.As with all of my big purchases, I did my fair share of research and read countless reviews, positive and negative ones. One of the recurring themes in the negative reviews I read were the objections to the new glossy glass displays. \"It's a mirror disguised as a computer display,\" some said. When I first took the computer out of the box and saw how reflective the display was, I started thinking about all of those reviews. When I powered the computer on, all of those unfavorable reviews seemed unfounded. The bright LED display, for the most part, is able to counter its mirror-like properties.The MacBook's physique with it's all aluminum case, and sleek, slim design is, of course, a huge part of the Mac's appeal. I personally love the feel of the keyboard on the MacBook and the new trackpad with the multi-touch gestures. When I first heard about the multi-touch gestures, I thought it was just a gimmick. However, after using them, I must say they're very practical. Namely, two-finger tap for right-click, two-finger scroll, and four-finger swipe for Expos\u00e9.OS X is great at handling system resources, especially when compared to Vista. Upon start up, without any applications open OS X only uses 285 MBs of RAM while Vista hogs 760 MBs of RAM. Coming from Windows, I do feel like OS X is a bit limited in some areas but I'll be able to live with it.Although my MacBook will be my main computer, I also have an old bulky IBM ThinkPad running Windows XP as my backup laptop/travel buddy. This MacBook has changed my mind about Apple products and OS X. But that's not to say that I'm a Mac zealot now. I still cling to XP and I have high hopes for Windows 7. I'm sure I'll lust for a new computer with Windows 7 when it's finally released. For now, though, I'm very pleased with my MacBook.Pros:-Design-Aluminum unibody case-Quiet running computer-Keyboard-Trackpad with multi-touch gestures-Bundled software-Able to run Windows with Boot Camp or virtualization apps-Time Machine-OS XCons:-OS X-Price-Only two USB ports-Lack of Firewire-No media card reader-No ExpressCard slot", "Date": "February 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "a worthy overall update of the macbook line", "Author": "Ben", "ReviewID": "RFV6PZWXBIZVG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the 2.4 gb macbook for over three weeks (from Amazon) and I can feel the positive differences between this and my last generation black macbook, which developed a squeaking problem at the palmrest. The screen is a plus because the use of LEDs makes the sleep-wake process almost instantaneous and the images do look sharper (the glossy screen has not been a problem but I am only using it indoors) and the screen also bends back more. And if you don't take care of your computer screen like I did before, you will for this one because fingerprints and dust are very noticeable on the screen and bezel.I use it to primarily to surf the web and to do word processing for school. The start-up of most programs are quick like with the older macbook and if they are slow it probably has to do with the program because MS Word takes a long time to close and is the only program that has caused the beachball to come up multiple times. The iSight is the same as the old macbook and it serves it purpose so it is on-par and there is an ambient light sensor next to it which I found very intrusive and does not work so well when the light source from sitting by the window is at an angle so I turned that off after it dimmed and brightened randomly.The structure without a doubt is the reason why I got this macbook (besides the multi-touch trackpad which I dreamed would come to the macbook from the macbook pro and air). I am not afraid to stack things on top of it but there is a battery cover issue that other users and I have had where it takes precision to put it on or else there is a small gap and it makes a noise when moved. The keyboard is the same but I did do sometimes have a problem with the spacebar not responding and is probably an individual defect and I am bringing it to the Apple Store soon. I was saved multiple times by the back-lit keyboard while working in the dark but I would say normally it is unnecessary and I have it off to conserve battery.However, I am raving over the new touchpad because I actually use the gestures like 3-finger swipe to go forward and back on webpages even though only Safari supports it and Firefox has yet to include it in an update. And the speakers are VERY much improved because before with the black macbook I would not even attempt to play a video in a moderately loud room but quality could be better now that the volume is higher. The battery has been decent and I get 4.0 hours with multiple programs open and wifi.However, the polycarbonate macbook is still being sold and earlier this week (Jan. 09) it got an upgrade and the specs are now comparable to the lower end 2.0 gb aluminum macbook and it is for hundreds less so that option is very nice if your choosing between that and the inferior aluminum model. I would like to add that the polycarbonate one has a FW 400 port and the aluminum has a mini-displayport which I find a hassle because it means an extra adapter to carry around. Talking about weight, the new macbook is half a pound lighter and thinner which is great since I carry it with me all the time. The 2.4 model is definitely better with more RAM, backlit keyboard, and larger disk memory if the extra three hundred is not an issue.I agree that the OS is very important and Leopard has a smooth and aesthetic interface that works intuitively. The commands are great and I found them to be more useful than on my PC desktop and laptop but it might also have to do with the keyboard. Windows 7 (Vista that is stable and has compatibility) is around the corner and it looks very promising for PCs and also for Macs since they can run windows with BootCamp and VMware. I have Vista running on my desktop and I don't have issues with it but I am planning to go all Mac since doing the cross-platform have certain limitations and is also a hassle. I do get drawn to the looks of the Apple products so that tipped the scale and the new macbook does not lack in specs.I can easily recommend this product over the old macbook since it is sturdier, runs quieter and cooler, has a touchpad, and has a faster front bus 1066 DDR3. I don't like putting my laptop on my lap but if I have to I would not hesitate. I gave this five stars because overall it is a great improvement from my black macbook even though I stated some slight issues that I had with the physical product and some minor annoyances. There is great costumer service from Amazon and Apple to fix defects.It is a suitable time to buy a macbook because it just got upgraded but iLife 09 just came out and is not bundled and so you should hold out until then (sadly I bought it before it was announced). For PC users the decision is probably based on money since you will be paying premium and if the Mac OS is that necessary. (I also got it because my school uses all macs). If people have iphones and ipods the syncing process just feels so much smoother and I have an ipod touch and itunes does backs up much faster on my macbook than my PC.

I had reservations about it after reading all the negative things people had to say about the screen.But after owning it, I'll tell you that the screen is no issue. I think it's stupid how people try to compare the 13\" to the 15\" from horrible viewing angles. You're never going to use your laptop from awkward angles so why dwell on that? When you're looking at it straight on, the screen is bright and the colors are gorgeous.I also don't care that there is no firewire because my camera only needs a USB to load.My absolute FAVORITE part of the new laptop is the Trackpad. It takes a couple days to get used to, but once you get the hang of it, you will never want to use a mouse again. I promise. Scrolling up and down with two fingers is so convenient. With three fingers, you can flick forward and back when surfing on the internet. Flicking up and down with four fingers clears the page and also shows expose. You can pretty much use the trackpad to accomplish anything you want and you can do it faster than using a mouse. I guess the only thing you would need a mouse for is designing and drawing but I don't need those so I haven't used a mouse since I bought this two weeks ago.Something else I love about the Mac is how fast it loads when you open the screen. You know how it takes about 1 minute for a Windows laptop to get warmed up and running smoothly after hibernation? Well it's not like that on a Macbook. When you open the Macbook from sleep, it's immediately brightly lit. When you open a program, it doesn't take 30 seconds to think about it. It opens it within 3 to 5 seconds and is ready to go. It's how a laptop should be!I am completely happy with the new MacBook. The battery lasts longer than you'd ever need. I usually get between 4 and 5 hours. The keyboard feels great to type on. All in all, it's phenomenal. Unless they come out with super ridiculously amazing new technology over the next three years, I will keep this and simply add RAM and a new hard drive later.

The Macbook is indeed the real deal and feels like a real notebook; it is very light, slick, fast and just a beauty to look at.. an amazing piece of technology...Pros- It is very light and much faster on Vista than my Toshiba. (I use parallels virtual machine)- It works very well with the iphone... syncing my iphone with iCal, Address book and iPhoto is too easy compared to working on windows..- The unibody design is awesome, a smooth architecture which i have no complaints about.- You cant see the speakers but they sound good. a friend has the previous macbook version but this one sounds much better.- Mac has built in sensors for adjusting to different light conditions and its brilliant.- Your iphone headset works on the MB like on the iPhone, it pauses music in itunes, quicktime and skips to next song etc.. mac technicians are really good..- The computer is very intuitive. i cannot get my hand off the touchpad, had an external mouse but cant do the gestures with it so i only use the trackpad instead... four, three, two finger gestures are just BRILLIANT... This touchpad works exactly like my iphone and makes switching windows and SPACES a breeze...pich pictures to enlarge or shrink and make text larger in Safari.- You may have heard everyone talk about the screen, yes it is really nice under the right conditions, pictures look nice and bright indoors.Cons- The screen has a crazzy glare when used outdoors, the sun will totally spoil the fun.. you have to make sure you stay away from direct sunlight... Obviously you get this with other glossy screen laptops.. even my toshiba had this glare...- Definitely wish it had the firewire, that totally sucks- The battery life when i run it on wifi and surfing net, playing music etc was shy of the 5 hours mac had previously advertised..came to about 4 hours which is not 5 but still pretty cool.No more windows notebooks for me, from now on its Mac!!!", "Date": "November 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "quick points to share", "Author": "visterm", "ReviewID": "R1PLP6VHS9E1IO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "+ Glossy LED display isn't as bad as I was worried about. Works just fine indoors. LED lighting easily overpowers any reflections you may have indoors (unless you're shining a flash light right on the screen). I haven't tried it outside, but I doubt it'll work at all. Then again, why am I trying to use my laptop outside? I usually like working at a desk! Or at least inside. Outside is for playing!+ OSX Battery life right on target (5 hrs)+ Form factor and size are really nice for the performance you get in this machine.  + Plays Command Conquer Red Alert 3 (under Windows) at 1280 by 800 with medium detail like it's nothing.  + Very nimble with multiple applications open+ Installs XP Pro and Vista just fine. Bootcamp drivers and support already on the OSX DVD, so you don't need to burn anything. Just pop in the disc after Windows is done installing.- Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter tricky to set up at first:  - OSX doesn't let you configure your MacBook to output to external only. You have to wake up or boot the computer while closed (power on, close display quickly!) with the external monitor plugged in for external display only while the laptop is open. If you unplug the Mini DisplayPort cable and plug it back in while in OSX, your laptop screen will turn on and stay on. Annoying.  - Windows does well with external displays thanks to the NVIDIA software that lets you set which display(s) you want to use, but the first few times, the drivers didn't seem to pick up the external display. Just unplug and plug back in. Eventually Windows XP Pro and Vista seem to \"learn\" your monitor preference with the external display plugged in. As an engineer, I have a hard time attributing \"learning\" to an OS, but that's what I observed. Vista seemed to learn faster than XP.  - Windows sometimes does not recognize the monitor after turning the monitor off for power saving. Again unplugging and replugging the mini displayport fixes this. Annoying.~ For what it's worth I use an Envision 20\" g2016wa2 monitor with the Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter. I had some problems getting the monitor to recognize the VGA signal reliably when running Windows, but after a software update in OSX that problem seemed to go away. May or may not have been related.- Screw holding hard drive clip in was easy to strip. Took a lot of pressure to start unscrewing, so be careful when you want to upgrade your hard drive.- Slot loading drive doesn't always behave: sometimes it won't swallow the disc, or eject it all the way out, or feel like it's still holding on to the disc after ejecting and you want to take the disc out. No worries though because you just have to push the disc back in, hit eject. If that doesn't work, you might need to power down so the drive resets. Annoying.- Battery life in Windows XP is worse than in OSX, probably because the power management drivers aren't as good. I noticed only 1:15 remaining after copying 5-10gigs of data with Wifi on and backlight about 20%. I may not have had a full charge though.- Stand-by not reliable in Windows, so make sure it actually goes to sleep before you bag the computer. I found out the hard way and pulled out a very warm metal laptop--cooled off quickly thankfully and continued running fine.- Touch pad in Windows is lousy: I use my right thumb to click touchpad buttons (in this case virtual button) while still touching the pad with my index finger, so when I do that in Windows, the cursor moves a little bit. You can use the tip of your index finger to do the click. Get an external mouse.NB: My Windows complaints are certainly minor issues for some people since this is a Mac, but some of us do like to be able to play PC games :)So overall, the problems I found certainly aren't show stoppers. It's a nice laptop given the performance, price, form factor, and capabilities.I hope you found my quick points helpful.P.S. Keep in mind I purchased the 2.0GHz model, which is plenty fast. In my experience the performance increase for the core processors isn't that huge when just increasing the frequency.

Chan", "ReviewID": "R1TRCQODDN1DAW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the 2.0GHz model at the Apple Store and I have to say that this laptop is simply the best. Sure there are some cons, but the pros outweigh them.First is the new design, the design is so much better than the old design although the old one is still pretty nice. You can still get that one for just under a thousand bucks, but I think the new ones are worth the extra cash. I would give design a 10/10.Next, the weight. The weight is noticeably lighter than the previous MacBook. It weights 4.5lb, which is pretty good. I would give the weight 9.5/10. It could have been a little lighter for something like this.Features, yes there are lots. The iSight camera is great and the keyboard. I have to say that the backlit keyboard doesn't seem useful to me, as I am a touch typist who doesn't look at the keyboard much. Sure, it may look nicer, but I don't think it's worth the extra $300. The hard drive is 160GB, but after the formatting and OS X installed it was a little over 140GB. For $1299, Apple could have added a 250GB one. Of course, Apple has been known for high profit margins. I like how the SuperDrive is standard now. There are 2 USB 2.0 ports, but sadly Firewire has been removed. Although I don't really use it much, it would have been nice to have it there in case I needed it. The glass trackpad is a killer. It may take some time to get used to, but it's a nice touch. The multi-touch gestures are now in the MacBook and I find them very useful, especially the 4 finger gestures. For features, I would give it 9.5. The firewire would be the cause.Performance. The performance is lightning fast. Although the processor is now 2.0GHz, I don't think there's a noticeable difference between the previous $1299 model. One of the things that made this happen would be the RAM. The new MacBooks are packed with 2GB of DDR3 RAM, which has better performance compared to DDR2. The new graphics card also contributed to this. Apple now uses the NVIDIA GeForce 9400M. It's still integrated, but it can get up to 5x faster than the Intel GMA X3100. For performance, I would give it a 10.Some may find the glossy screen annoying, but I like it. I like how it's LED backlit now. Some users received the bad displays, but luckily I got the good one. For the display, I would give it a 9.4.The new aluminum enclosure is great and more durable than the previous plastic one. It feels more solid when it's carved from just one brick of aluminum.I would recommend this computer to anyone looking for a brand new computer. The switch to OS X is worth it and I think people who want something durable which can last for a couple years would find this a good choice.

Yes its glossy and yes it is going to be reflective (its made of glass what do you expect?), it does NOT affect usability to a degree, I use this in a well lit office building and it looks fine, in my house it looks fine, now maybe if I used it outside in direct sunlight.....I might have a problem, but seriously when and how often is that going to happen?The screen is great, the blacks look fine, they do NOT looked washed out.  And the screen is definitely not cheap.Second is the loss of Firewire, this mac is made to be an entry level laptop, Firewire is not widely used as much as USB 2.0.  So please stop complaining about it already, unless your doing some major file transferring dont worry about, USB 2.0 will do the trick, and if you want it then go spendan extra $200 for it.For the price you cant beat it, $989 for a laptop that is now called \"macbook pro\" for $1199?

My HP 17\" laptop was like a brick and I wanted something that did not weigh a lot. I originally was planning on spending half a grand on a cheap laptop. I guess I ended up spending much more!I first went with a Dell computer and liked it a lot. The price was great and it had the best specifications  I could find for the money. Unfortunately I had to return it due to some minor issues.The problem I had with making the initial purchase at first was the price. It cost almost five hundred dollars more than a comparable PC with even better specs. The hard drive was also too small and only came with 2gb of ram. Since I absolutely need to run some Windows programs, i'd have to also purchase a licensed copy of Windows.To me, 160gb on such an expensive computer is just not acceptable. It seems that Apple always has put smaller hard drives in their computers.  To be honest, until I opened and used my Macbook I felt really guilty for paying so much for a laptop. Generally I don't pay over a grand for a laptop and I build my own desktop computers based on what I need. After using the computer for awhile, my guilty conscience went away very fast.I won't lie about this. I loved this laptop from the start. When I first saw the picture of the new Macbook I thought it kind of looked ugly! In person it definitely is not. It's probably one of the best designed computers ever.First thing I did was upgrade to a new 500gb hard drive and 4gb of ram. Upgrading these is stupid easy. Anyone can do it. I'm so glad Apple has decided to make upgrading easier for people. My old ibook took over 2 hours and the removal of over 40 screws to upgrade the hard drive! This Macbook requires the removal of....ONE screw to access the hard drive.The price is the biggest negative. I feel it's worth paying extra for because of the build quality, but it's still too high. I think this laptop should be a hundred less.I'm not bothered by the lack of Firewire. I don't use firewire that much to really miss it that much. I do however wish it had some other high speed port such as eSATA. USB is just unbearably slow to me.I'm sick of Windows XP, so I decided to install Vista 64 bit version. No problem at all with this. Here is what is my biggest problem with Apple is. They love to nickle and dime you to try and sell you something bigger and better. Beforehand I did not know that Apple officially doesn't support Vista 64 on a Macbook. They want you to use an expensive Macbook Pro or Mac Pro. What's funny is that ALL the drivers still work, but they made it so that the installer doesn't run unless you run some DOS commands. When using this work-around every single device was working perfectly fine!My main computer is a PC desktop, but i'm liking this Macbook so much I might make the switch to Mac OS full time. I also installed Vmware Fusion and that really helps when theres a program I need to run that's only available on Windows. What's nice is that Vmware Fusion now supports Bootcamp partitions, so no need to reinstall or buy a second copy of Windows.The Macbook is pretty fast. No problems in this area. I'm surprised to be able to run Vista 64 in Vmware with no major problems. It's not fast, but works well. For me, upgrading to the 2.4ghz version was not needed. 2Ghz is more than enough for me. Three hundred for .4 ghz, backlit keyboard and a 250gb hard drive isn't worth it for me. For some it is, but it just depends on what you need.The display isn't the best, but in my opinion it's much better than most others. I actually have no negatives about the picture quality itself. You can view the display at an angle, but to a point. With my other laptop, you move the display an inch and it's hardly viewable. The glossy screen is of course annoying, but not big of a deal for me.At first I said that i'd never buy a Macbook because it had a terrible \"chicklet\" keyboard. Once I used it, it's perfectly fine. I should also point out that I absolutely HATE the wireless Apple Keyboard and find it unusable. Yet they're almost the same. Strange isn't it? This one is very good. Perhaps it's all due to a different typing angle. The trackpad is perfect. It's the best one i've ever used.I have not played any games with this yet, but I will soon. I'm sure it will play Half Life 2 and other games just fine. The shared video memory is kind of annoying, but it won't bother me much I think. I really don't know how much of a negative this is.The sound is somewhat tinny, but it's acceptable to me. My old HP 17\" monster had great sound for a laptop, but that was a laptop made for gaming.For me, this is just about as perfect as it gets. It just needed eSATA, a bigger hard drive and a lowered price. One hundred less and it'd be a pretty fair price. I will try to update this review with notes if I come across any problems.3-15-2009 UPDATE:I've been using this each and every day. Since day one I've had no regrets buying this despite it being way overpriced for the specs.The only negative i've had so far is using Vista 64-bit edition on this is a lot of trouble. It takes a lot of work just to get the Bootcamp Setup (inside VISTA)  to run properly. It would not unless I ran a few commands at the DOS prompt.Then the next problem in Vista is that the drag and drop does not work well. Luckily they had an update and it works just fine. It's just too bad it takes so much more effort than it should to double click in Windows with this trackpad. When clicking and scrolling the pointer moves around all the time in Windows, but not in Leopard. Strange.Since Apple advertises Bootcamp and tries to sell you a computer based on this feature, it's their job to make sure the trackpad works properly in Windows I think.Getting sound to work in Vista 64 was also a major pain. After trying four sets of drivers I finally got it to work. I downloaded some beta Realtek drivers off a website.My suggestion is to not bother with the 64-bit edition of Vista on this or just go with XP.The display is also just average. I'm not really impressed with it. It could be better. In terms of the quality of the LCD display, i'd give it a 7/10. What's strange is that the resolution in VMWARE Fusion would go past 1280x800 without actually having to scroll off the screen. I found that rather strange. Could the LCD display modes past this limit, but just not officially? Makes me wonder.My other negative is that the DVD-ROM is fairly slow at reading DVD movies. I wonder why very few Apple computers have 16x burners in them? Perhaps 8x is more reliable to them.I sure hope the next apple Macbooks have eSATA or USB3. USB 2.0 is just way too slow for backup.", "Date": "January 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Review: satisfied", "Author": "Valathil Premraj \"Premraj V\"", "ReviewID": "R20HEDZBDZQQY1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a first time Apple Mac user, I have come to like the Macbook very well. A few minor flaws apart (which all laptops have), the Macbook is a solid purchase. I see many sore complaints in other user reviews, but if a lack of Firewire port or a display with whites/blacks not being as good is a problem for you, then this one's not for you. However, if you do not need a Firewire (I don't, my WD external HDD works on USB 2) and you get to decide the lighting conditions for use, then there aren't many other flaws.

Aluminum body; better displacement of heat than previous model, but body may dent easier.2. Button-less trackpad, people will have to retrain their muscle memory, but is rather easy to get used to.3. Display port replaces mini DVI port, but at least they have new adapters to DVI and VGA.Overall: I am generally neutral on this redesign. Very pleased with graphics upgrade, but equally disappointed by lack of ports, poor LCD display, and glossy only option.

I've wanted to try a mac for a while but always went with lower end pcs that, while they were affordable, never lasted more than a couple years of steady use without progressively declining in function and plummeting to eventual doom. Hoping to make a better investment, I got one of these on ebay that had been upgraded to 4gb of ram and Mac osx Lion. When I got it I upgraded to OSX Mavericks- Apple's latest operating system which is also free. It runs smoother than any of my windows computers did even when they were new. Don't get me wrong- I'm not anti-windows, I think it's a great operating system and I've used it for years; but I will say that even though this macbook is 6 years old it feels revolutionary compared to most current Windows machines.The keyboard feels very right and comfortable. I got one that had a backlight installed and I can't believe it can be so easy to type in the dark. I find that the way the keys are spaced apart makes it easier to keep the keyboard clean. I was surprised by how sturdy of a built this machine seems to have; it doesn't feel so delicate as I was expecting, meaning I'm not afraid to carry it around and use it in different places.The operating system is a great experience, especially coming from Windows. It feels user friendly and is in all, beautiful and streamlined; I can't really articulate it in a way that does it justice. It exceeded my expectations. The one thing that was a bit confusing to me coming from windows 7 is that there isn't a start menu- to access your files you have to use finder which will bring you to your folders and documents, pictures, music, videos, etc. Looking for files made me want to punch myself until I figured this out.I'm stunned by the quality of the built in iSight camera. It's more than sufficient for taking stills, having FaceTime or Skype calls, and recording video. The trackpad is also nice- I've never used one so large and it's very pleasant. Another thing that took some getting used to is that the most convenient way of scrolling a page is using the trackpad with two fingers. There's also no physical button on the trackpad- the entire thing just kinda is the button. Adapting to this also made me want to punch myself but that lasted all of 5 minutes. Now that I'm used to it I prefer it over a physical mouse or the other trackpads I've used.Overall, for my experience: basic stuff with the internet, youtube, music, communication, entertainment,schoolwork... this machine has been more than perfect and honestly better than I expected. Don't expect it to fill the gaping void in your soul, but if you have a longing to join the mac club but don't have a thousand bucks this is a very viable option.", "Date": "April 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "STILL SHOCKED AT THE PRICE!", "Author": "Sabrina S.

After Apple had announced this new notebook, I was in awe. I went out the next day, even though I just purchased my last MacBook a few months ago, and purchased this new MacBook. This notebook is much better than the previous version. Below are a few of my observations and some things I like (and don't).The Likes: The screen, though very shiny and mirror like, has a more crisp look and is brighter. Right when I first powered the device up I noticed the difference. Even though the processor is the same speed, this MacBook seems much quicker. This is probably due to the new graphics card. The new MacBook looks a lot better since it is made of aluminum rather than plastic. This makes the older MacBooks look cheaper, in my opinion. This one feels much more sturdy and better made. My two favorite additions are the light up keyboard and the trackpad. First, the light up keyboard is very helpful and looks really great. The glass trackpad doesn't look or feel glass at all. The whole trackpad is the clicker, which is something I do not use. I changed the trackpad settings to allow me to click just by tapping and right click by tapping with two fingers. This is really something that is better experienced than told. I am excited to try out the 24in LED display that Apple says was made for the Macbook (should be available November 08). Oh, and the sound on this MacBook seems so much better in this new Mac compared to the last version.Don't Like: Not happy Apple did away with Firewire for this device. I have an external hard drive that I'm not going to be able to use not that I have my new MacBook. I could use USB but that takes too long. The only other reason I would use Firewire would be to migrate my information from my old Mac to my new one. This was thought of by Apple, which was fix by users being able to migrate data using ethernet (I was told at the Apple Store that this is somewhat faster than Firewire). This is the only complaint I've had so far, but it's not that big of a deal for me. Although it makes me want to get the Time Capsule wireless hard drive Apple has (this was probably their plan!).If you've never owned a Mac, I say give this baby a try. You can install Windows if you'd like, and Macs are known to last a lot longer since they do not get viruses as much as other computers. This is a great device, but I hope Apple waits awhile to give the MacBook line a new upgrade so I can keep this device a little longer than I kept my last MacBook.

Immediately it was powered up and explored and everything works perfectly, although calibration of the display was not as easy as my PowerMac on a Cinemadisplay 20\".This morning after using the Macbook at work and turning it off, I noticed several white \"specks\" on the screen, one near the camera, another 1\" away from the left border at the center of the screen, and another 2\" diagonal to the right of the \"Macbook\" logo.  I attempted to first blow the specks off which didn't work, so I attempted to wipe it with the cloth included in the box.  That didn't work either.  It turns out this is dust BEHIND the glass.  I have owned several other laptops prior to this, and this is the first time I am experiencing a problem this small yet this obvious.  For a perfectionist such as myself, it is a pretty big deal (Amazon rectified the situation for me).Besides that, this laptop is probably the most solid feeling laptop I have ever felt.  It is heavier than my last laptop (XPS M1330 which was also solidly built) but slightly thinner.  The screen is super glossy, but so far I haven't had a problem with it.  The trackpad takes some getting used to because it is hinged at the top edge, so if your finger has moved to the top edge you have to remember to move your finger away from the top edge to actually click it.  The new multi-touch features for Expose and whatnot are cool, but I'll always take a real multi-button mouse over a touchpad anyday.Disappointed that I have to purchase a mini displayport adapter from Apple in order to use it with the Cinemadisplay rather than having the option of purchasing non-proprietary stuff.Overall, if you're looking to switch to a Mac and are willing to spend a little more than a comparably equipped PC, the base Macbook is the way to go.  The reason I didn't go for the higher end Macbook, I don't need the HD space (I have a 1TB PowerMac server at home) or illuminated keys, and don't do anything that requires .4ghz more power.

If you are looking for the best bang for your buck, then you should unfortunately look elsewhere.  In the midst of economic trouble apple has decided to increase the cost of their new entry level aluminum macbooks by 20% over early 2008s models with marginal performance gains from the additional front side bus.Pros-new trackpad has cool factor (although buggy)-new graphic card has made this a decent gaming platform-design is smooth and polishedCons- Overall performance based on price has decreased.  Now instead of getting a 2.4Ghz dual core for $1300 you must shell out an additional $300 @ $1600 to acquire this performance. If you checkout macworld's benchmarks the performance gained over the additional FSB is marginal at best.  The only gains come in frames per second during game testing.- graphics card is nice but most ppl are not even into hardcore computer gaming and the macbook use to be a nice alternative to the pro models hefty price tag for us non gamers....wish this could have been an option.-160GB or 250GB hard drive with only 5400rps!  At these price points I expected at the minimum 7200rps.  I know this can be manually changed, but who wants to shell even more money after buy such an expensive laptop.Overall this computer performs well but the price is even becoming to high for some of us apple fans.  The macbooks have always been a top of the line luxury laptop but now they are widening that gap even further with design not performance fueling the price increases.  My recommendation is to wait at this time b/c come mid 2009 the prices will hopefully fall and Apple's new and improved SnowLeopard OS will be out.  With Steve Jobs you never buy the first iteration of a new product, unless you are willing to pay top dollar for something that will decrease in price by 20% in 6months.", "Date": "October 22, 2008"},

This all ended with the Macbook as Macs are secure and don't need any of this fussing as it is all taken care of automatically within the machine itself.  I use one little program to clean it up about once a week and that's that.  I also have a three year warranty on each machine. I have used the warranty on my prior Macbook twice and the Apple Store's Genius Bar fixed one problem overnight and the other within 15 minutes, both problems completely covered under the warranty. My Macbook is very lightweight, never gets hot to the touch (a frequent problem with other laptops), works perfectly with every application whether graphics, audio-visual playback, word processing, ebook reading or web building.  I almost got the Macbook Pro instead but am glad I did not as it would have been too big and too heavy.

In using a USB port for that task, the computers recognized each other but the G5 kept searching for another computer, and an hour on the phone with Apple support didn't solve the problem, so I was given a Case No. the very first day.  I finally just manually transferred the information I wanted, leaving all the accumulated junk.  The next day, I realized what the problem was:  the G5 had been looking for my Wii, which was not turned on but is wirelessly connected to my network.My first computer was an Apple IIe in the early 1980s and I've had many more since then; some I liked more than others.

This was almost too hot to touch, and I still worry about scorching my couch with it. When I went online to investigate this, I found two disturbing facts. First, this is not unique. This is how most of the cords come, and no one seems willing to place it on anything overly flammable. Second, this can lead to a short life for my charger, and a replacement will cost about $80 and have the same problem.

The laptop itself is incredibly solid, there are almost no moving parts on the case, and it has no squeaking, give, or any other little annoyances that exist on other laptops (like weak-points in the case, seams that are coming apart, etc). The unibody construction is simple amazing.  This *will* sound ridiculous, but even closing the lid is more satisfying than with other laptops.  Finally, I am in love with the trackpad.  It is incredible.  I used to be unable to control a computer with a trackpad and I carried around a mouse with me everywhere.  The trackpad on this macbook, though, has eliminated my need for a mouse.  I don't know if it the gigantic size, the mouse button integrated into the pad, or all the awesome multi-touch gestures, but the combination of all of that has eliminated my need for an external mouse with this laptop.As far as the hardware inside goes, the computer is very fast, the graphics are great, and it has a nice big hard drive.

For those of you with G4 PowerBooks, you're in for some nice upgrades:1. The screen is much, much brighter and despite how some users feel about the \"glossy\" look, it is much better than the dimly lit PowerBook screen.2. It is certainly fast enough to run streaming video from Youtube, and [...] without choking. I can run many more applications simultaneously without any performance issues (though I do have 4 GB memory installed in my model).3. The large trackpad is a big plus, especially if you don't tote around a mouse.4. No more noisy fans running constantly. Under the same usage patterns as the PowerBook, this runs quietly and handles some big computational work smoothly without heating up. (I occasionally do some bioinformatic work on this computer).Downsides:FireWire: Other users have complained about the lack of a FireWire port on this model. I have mixed feelings about this... I do not ever plan on using a FireWire device on this computer. However, I have found using the FireWire supported Target Disk Mode useful in the past to rescue data from a crippled Mac. But I now back up data more routinely, and I doubt I would even use TSD.Headphone Hiss: I use headphones with this computer often. Unlike the PowerBook, the headphones produce a background hiss. I have read elsewhere that this is an issue with the sound card of the MacBook and not an issue with headphones or unshielded cables. The hiss clicks on and off as the soundcard activates and deactivates when sound is sent to the speakers. This may or may not be fixable through software updates in the future. Until then, it is only a minor annoyance.UPDATE 10/2/09: HEADPHONE HISS ELIMINATED THROUGH UPGRADE TO MAC OS X 10.6 (SNOW LEOPARD)", "Date": "February 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Ideal performance for size.", "Author": "Praet \"-Praet\"", "ReviewID": "R2VIVE5C46H917", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have never owned a Macintosh product of any kind. The 13 inch MacBook fit all the specifications I wanted in a laptop including size and battery life. I was wary to make the change but the transition has so far been smooth. This includes my own customization of the laptop preferences and finding applications that fulfill my needs when the ones that come with it do not.The screen works great. I have no problems with the glossiness in any way. Once the machine is on, I pay no attention to reflections most of the time. This may be due to the fact that I tend to avoid using it in lighting situations that would provide the most reflections. The auto-dim/brighten feature due to light sensitivity is nice. I am not sure it has a significant effect and it does seem overly responsive to small light changes.Most displayed images and texts are sharp and colorful enough for my taste but it seems like some people may be annoyed by it a little bit. There does appear to be some slight blurring of text at certain positions on the screen, especially 'l's, 't's and 'f's where there is the horizontal line on each of those letters. There does not appear to be that line for 'l's in the default font but in some fonts it is there and you may notice the slight blurring.Also, the max resolution of 1280 by 800 was at first surprising. I was expecting at least one more step up in resolution but it is still suitable for how I use it and the screen size. As I think about it now, an extra step up may make it more difficult to see clearly on because of the screen size. I do not think of the screen size as a con, if I did I would have gotten the 15 inch MacBook.The trackpad works wonderfully in the native OS and I have no problems with the use of the gestures. The gestures do not feel in any way awkward or cumbersome to me. I have never had experience with that kind of interaction on a trackpad and the gestures feel reasonable for the actions that they perform. I find that the trackpad is the most accurate one I have used among a few laptops. This includes response to my own changes in finger movement speed, the tap clicking instead of using a button, and the scrolling gesture which I use the most among the gestures available.The sound quality from the built-in speakers is fine. I cannot even find the speakers as of now. If you want high quality, get some headphones. Also, the microphone works surprisingly well. Again, if you want high quality, get your own microphone.I cannot comment much on the built in camera as I have barely used it. It does appear to work satisfactorily if you want to use it for webcam chat programs.I have used Bootcamp to install the Windows Vista Ultimate 32-bit version on a separate partition. The partitioning and installation process is easy. The only issue I have with Bootcamp is the fact you cannot adjust the size of a partition once it has been made. If you only use Bootcamp and want to change the Windows partition size, you must delete the partition and restart the whole process. There may be a third-party application that you could use but I personally think it should be a feature within Bootcamp.The trackpad is significantly harder to use in Windows, but keep in mind this is a step down from what I consider to be the most responsive trackpad I have ever used. When I say 'significantly', I mean only that I can tell a difference. It is not an extreme difference. It is still quite usable. You do not get to use of most of the gestures as they are dependent on features within OS X Leopard; though the scroll gesture is still there and works well enough.The Windows install was for playing games only. I did not want to leave them behind simply because I switched to a Macintosh. I also will most likely be using it to run SAS which is a statistical software. I am not sure if it will work or not at this point, but I am hopeful considering everything else works fine. The drivers are alright except for the 9400M graphics card not having newer drivers released by nVidia last I checked and some audio stuttering every few minutes. This does not represent a strong annoyance to me as it only lasts a few seconds. The stuttering is at a rapid rate so not much noise gets lost to it. Any voices are still audible and understandable as is the music and other effects.The graphics are surprisingly good. Left 4 Dead and Bioshock both run fairly well. I have most options put to their highest settings except for the resolution and some texture settings. This is to ensure a smooth framerate which the MacBook is capable of in those two games. Do not expect max settings in newer games when purchasing this laptop. I have no problem with this. I am not the type of person that needs the best graphics. One final thing, games take a lot of energy and the battery life is greatly reduced when playing them. This is the case with all laptops and you will want to plug it in if you play graphic intensive games.In general, I really enjoy my purchase of the 13 inch MacBook. Of course it does look nice but the main plus is how slim it is for the performance I get out of it. The battery life is excellent. Most features of the laptop are perfectly satisfactory or exceed my expectations. I do not recommend it for power users who want the best performance, people that have tons of peripherals (it only has two USB ports), or hardcore gamers that expect top quality graphics capabilities. It seems to be an excellent general use laptop but may not be the best choice for those who have a specialized need.", "Date": "January 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "amazing laptop", "Author": "Igwe Kalu Kalu Ogba", "ReviewID": "R20E3TEUS8A1BM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've wanted to buy a new laptop for a while now but was completely disgusted with vista and didn't really know what to do. When the new macbooks came out, I thought, well, it runs windows and linux as well as os x, so even if I don't like os x, I can still run xp on a new laptop.To put it very simply, this is a very good laptop. I couldn't believe the size of it, it's by far the thinnest laptop I have ever owned. The aluminum body is so sexy people actually stop by at my office to stare at it. I gave a presentation using iwork (amazing software by the way) the other day and there were more questions about my laptop than about my presentation.The only problem I have had is with the trackpad. It seems to freeze every now and then and tapping to click/scroll doesn't really work well for me. I had to disable tapping and the apple update didn't really fix this problem for me.But besides that, great screen, built in video camera and great software. os x is so nice. using spotlight for one thing is one of the highlights of my day. It takes a while to get used to os x but no problem, if you use google you can find out anything.

Most impressive are it's speed and how quite it is when running. When I run any website with flash video on my 2 year old desktop computer, the fans immediately begin to spin at full velocity. The Mac manages to play flash video without breaking a sweat, and without so much as a sigh. Safari loads web pages crazily fast. Some pages load instantly, such as GoDaddy, even if the page has not been cached. Very impressive.The wireless-N receiver in the MacBook works great and manages to pick up wireless signals with very high reception that my friend's recent model Dell laptop doesn't even recognize (even though it has a wireless-N receiver also).I love the new trackpad. It makes navigation very quick and can be customized to suit your likes. By default, you have to press down on the track pad to click, but you can change the behavior so that only a light touch will click, very similar to how you click on the iPhone. Scrolling with two fingers quickly becomes second nature, and using 3 fingers to navigate backwards in the web browser is handy. A two finger tap brings up the secondary menu for where you click. Perhaps the funnest trackpad gesture is using the four finger \"throw\" to send all the open windows flying to the edge of the screen to reveal your desktop. Another four finger \"pull\" brings them back into view, and another \"pull\" will bring up Expose so you can view all open windows and choose the one you are looking for quickly. Even though I've never owned a Mac before, I've tested out past editions that had the click button at the bottom of the track pad, and I think it's removal is a positive thing and a little bit of playing around with the new trackpad gestures should convince old users of the same.Spotlight makes launching an application a split-second process, and I much prefer it to using the dock. Spotlight also lets you speedily find a file you are looking for by typing all or part of it's name. And searching within the Finder (the Mac's equivalent to Windows Explorer) makes finding the file you are looking for a very easy and satisfying procedure. If only Windows had this feature. I think it is a basic and obvious thing to have in any operating system.My MacBook immediately recognized the shared parts of my Windows network without any work on my part. I was pleasantly surprised by this. I wish I could say that my Windows machine was as quick to recognize my Mac on the network.The built-in iSight camera also works wonderfully. My only gripe at all so far with the Mac is that using my iPhone (which I already had synced with my Windows machine) is not a very user-friendly process, and it is not immediately obvious how to make the iPhone work with multiple machines. For a company that prides itself on user friendliness, they should really work on this aspect of their software. Overall thought, I highly recommend the latest edition of the MacBook.", "Date": "December 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Quality and Freedom", "Author": "William Bledsoe", "ReviewID": "R3OCP5JNF8O3JS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I grew up using PCs, but after Windows 8, I'd had enough of Windows, and Microsoft for that matter. I switched to Linux and while I do love it, it was and still is lacking compared to Windows and OS X. It's catching up fast, but more time is needed. After years of this 'do it yourself' journey, I decided to make the switch to Mac. From my understanding Mac was much more simple and polished than competitors, and after receiving this MacBook, I can completely confirm this. This MacBook, being about six years old, wouldn't have too high of a standard to meet for those of us familiar with tech and its tendency to become obsolete and sluggish quickly, but it far exceeded my expectations. Upon opening the package my mouth actually dropped at just how thin this thing is in person. The stock photos do it no justice whatsoever. Until I got it completely out of the packaging and examined it closer, I briefly worried the seller may have sent me an Air or a Retina Pro by mistake. With the lid closed, its probably close to two iPhone 5's on top of each other in thickness. Very thin device. Its not a MacBook Air, but it is extremely light by laptop standards. It is as you probably already know, crafted out of a single block of aluminum. This makes for a beyond sturdy and solid feel. I bought mine refurbished (And again, this computer is about 6 years old.) and the only cosmetic issues other than insignificant scuff and small scratches were a VERY SMALL dent on the back corner and a stripped hard drive screw. I can't stress enough how well this machine is built. The overall design is tough meets stylish, the keys give just the right amount of pressure when typing, the display, while not Retina, is high definition and unless you decide to kiss the display, you won't spot a pixel. I notice a lot of people complaining about the all glass construction of the display, but I couldn't be happier with it. I don't plan on ever buying a matte screened laptop again. Glare will be present in obvious locations: out in direct sunlight, with a bright lamp CLOSE behind you etc, but I find that a few taps of the brightness buttons quickly corrects this minor hiccup. The trackpad is an absolute marvel, all glass and very spacious. To be honest it almost feels like I'm using a tablet in terms of responsiveness and smoothness to the touch. I always loved using a mouse, even on laptops, but with the MacBook its not only not necessary, its actually a downgrade from just using the trackpad. You can do all non keyboard navigation on the trackpad alone and it is every bit as easy and fun as using the touchscreen of an iPad or iPhone. There are more gestures and personalization options for the trackpad than I have time to cover, but if you are on the fence about trackpads, look up the MacBook trackpad in action, you'll love it. Although the design and overall beauty of this machine (It is an Apple product, right?) is nothing short of remarkable, the inside is equal if not better than the outside. Mine was shipped with Apple's latest OS 'Mavericks' and it is hands down the best OS I've used in my entire life. The best way to explain it to someone who has never had a Mac would be to imagine an iPod or iPhone morphing into a full computer. It is to the traditional laptop what an iPhone is to any Android. It's smooth and fast in ways I never heard even the biggest Apple fanboys brag about. I actually didn't notice how slow a lot of the 'little things' were on Windows and Linux until I switched to Mac. For example; navigating sites like FaceBook and Twitter, playing YouTube videos, opening larger applications. All things that took a few moments to really get smooth and lined out on my old computers, my old machines were by no means slow outdated, the overall smoothness just isn't comparable with the Mac's. These actions were near instant on my MacBook. I can only imagine how speedy it would be with an SSD. It's a very connected device, if you have decent internet and especially if you own any iOS devices, you will fall in love with the features. Send a text through wifi, FaceTime, download apps very similarly to how you would on an iDevice, sync with your iOS devices flawlessly, it just blows me away. It does everything the average user would want, plus a lot more. It's difficult to review this entire device without writing a book as it is absolutely packed with features. As someone who has used a little bit of everything on computers and has predominately used HP and Dell hardware, the MacBook is single handedly the best computer I've ever used. It does all the casual stuff very well and does more intensive tasks exceptionally well for its power and age. I don't think I'll ever buy any other brand than Apple when shopping for a laptop in the future. I purchased mine from the Gordy's Gadgets store on Amazon, and the quality and dedication I received from this seller has been the best I have ever have with any seller, online or in person. He answered all my questions quickly and informatively and upon hearing about the screw issue (I wanted to upgrade the hard drive) offered to send me a replacement MacBook and the required tool for upgrading it. He shipped it out and got it to me well before Amazon estimated and helped me the entire time with my questions and concerns and was extremely polite and helpful the entire time. His store is to other sellers what this MacBook is to other laptops- a shining example. I can't express enough how satisfied I am with this MacBook and Gordy's service. I give this MacBook a MUST BUY for anyone shopping for a mobile computer and from my own overwhelmingly positive experience, if you don't see Gordy's Gadgets in stock WAIT until they get one in, his cheerfulness and support is worth the waiting.

I debated switching from Lion to the OS X below. I even thought I might sell it or send it back, but I ended up uprgading the RAM to 8 gb first just to see (apple released an update for this computer that allows it to take up to 8gb of RAM). Now it runs super fast. All the programs open fast. If you are a multitasker like myself, know that this computer cannot and will not multitask effectively with anything less than 4gb, although I think 8gb is JUST right since you only get like 5gb of it available to you (apple getting away with highway robbery, per usual). 2gb of ram is okay if you're simply using word or itunes or something.

With the release of these new Macbooks in October 2008, I knew it was time for me to upgrade to a notebook with the performance of my iMac.Design - One of the most striking elements, for me, about thew new 13-inch MacBooks is that Apple has went to the aluminum enclosure, for this consumer priced machine. The aluminum notebooks from Apple have always looked, felt, and held up quite nicely, my Powerbook is a testament to that. Now, the aluminium form factor is available starting at $1299.This particular notebook is perhaps the best feeling of any notebook I have held. Upon opening it from the box, I was immediately impressed. While feeling light and sleek, it feels sculpted from a block, so very solid. This must be due to the new unibody structure that Apple is touting. I don't know how they do it, but I do agree it feels wonderful on your lap and looks great on your desk.Performance - The performance of the new MacBooks have really taken a step forward. While the Core 2 Duo Processors are about the same speed as the last generation of the plastic MacBooks, the graphics in these notebooks are on another level. The new Nvidia graphics in the notebook is keeping up with my aluminum iMac's graphics, impressive for a notebook! The magazines that have reviewed the notebook say the same thing. The graphics performance on this Macbook is 3-5 times faster than the previous Intel Integrated Graphics. This is a solid step forward.2 GB Memory - This is a sufficient amount, for the type of applications many people will run with Mac OS X. I use 4 GB on my iMac, but 2GB for my notebook is fine. If I want more later, I can swap it out.Hard Drive - For the first time, the hard drive is easy to access in the MacBook. This is great! Not only can you upgrade to a faster or bigger hard drive, when you need to someday, it will prolong how long you can use this notebook. Hard drives are one of the weaker points in a computer due to the physical moving parts. With this notebook, we have easy access to the battery and hard drive, so if everything else keeps running, we can keep this notebook going for years, something that makes me feel good about the investment. I have wished user accessible hard drives on a Mac notebook, and it finally happened.Super Drive - It's still nice to be able to watch and burn DVD disks.Software - The lastest version of Mac OS X Leopard is included alongside iPhoto, iTunes, iMovie, iDVD, etc. A lot of great programs to get the new Mac users going.Connections - I have several Firewire devices, so I was sad to see Firewire removed from the MacBook. However, USB has been so much more successful that you can understand Apple's move. Thankfully, most of my firewire devices are USB compatible as well.Overall, I seriously considered the MacBook Air, when it came out back in January. However, I'm glad I waited and that Apple released this 13-inch Aluminium MacBook. To me, it feels even better in your hands and on your lap than the Air, plus you get a significantly faster computer with user replaceable battery and hard drive. While the glare on the glass screen is terrible compared to the matte display on my old Powerbook, images and movies do look a lot better and \"pop.\" I'm glad I decided on the MacBook.

Dinh \"iAmAlexander408\"", "ReviewID": "R2JR63PLI9TQQA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Edit: Also the Firewire issue I've been hearing about. I'm a Business Major students and see no need in using a Firewire. I've never used a Firewire in my entire life. I mean harddrive fits just great in USB ports and also camcorder and other stuff I never dealt with that stuff. If I also have to, I'm sure I can do it without the need of Firewire. So I say let Firewire go because I a business major student don't need it.What I'd like to say is that I read all the reviews on the new Macbook on Amazon and Cnet before buying my new one. I was still convinced to buy one because I think in my point of view its alot better overall than my last Macbook (White, 2.4 Ghz, 2 GB ram). Although they increased the price of the notebook, I feel that its still worth the price because it is nicknamed \"Macbook Pro Mini\".First of all the display issue. I notice is looks alot better than the old Macbook, like so much brighter. I don't know why people are complaining about the screen so much because I can see just fine on my Macbook everything, no glares whatsoever. I just put my desktop background as the big Earth and all black and I don't see any bad in this. I mean it looks just great. I would think that maybe if you go on the Macbook outdoors alot it may be an issue but I'm a student and I do most of my work indoors (classrooms, library, home). Go ahead to the Apple store and you'll see display is much brighter and also the screen looks just so great that you want it even more. I have no problems with the display but if your eyes don't like it, well, myns do and many others who purchase it too.Next the Macbook is almost like a Macbook Pro but smaller and not as powerful. The Macbook now has backlit keyboards, it has a much better stronger graphic card (5x better wow), and also the front but has gone up from the 600s to 1000s (DDR3). Also the battery life has increased and weight decreased. These feature you'll find on a Macbook Pro which the cheapest before were around the $2k range. Now you can get one for less (student discount for me =]).Graphic card I can notice is actually much better. I played some FPS and RPG games and I notice its so much better than my old Macbook. The FSB is noticeably better and my multitasking skills in the Macbook is alot faster now. The battery life I can notice lasts that extra half an hour longer than my old one, and the half pound weight is just great. Even the thinner Macbook fits even better in my backpack.I put this Macbook inside my Brenthaven case (great case by the way) and the old Macbook took up a big space of compartment but now because I have a thinner one its much roomier inside there now so I don't have to worry about all my books squashing the Macbook.Also the big deal probably, the aluminum. The aluminum is much more powerful and because its a big deal about the Uni-Body closure. They were right. I think this aluminum feels better than the Macbook Air. I don't know but carrying this thing you feel more secured about it getting scratches or squashed by a heavy book. This is like a Superman armor compared to the old plastic one.I carry my Macbook everyday to school and I have to walk up this gigantic hill to class everyday. Knowing that the Macbook is made of aluminum and won't get hurt in my backpack makes me feel alot more confident (I don't throw my Macbook in the backpack by the way, there's a special compartment they made that fits the Macbook exactly perfect fit and padded =D )The touchpad glass is so great. I mean the button pushing thing is hard at first but its been two days and I love it so much. Also the new Multi-Touch gestures on MACBOOKS are so awesome now. I mean I can do so much things now without having to reach for the keyboard or moving the trackpad as much. The expose with the four fingers trackpad is so great. I mean this is going to change my notebook experience, Apple is so great to design these gestures it makes it easier to use the computer.Overall, the screen isn't an issue, but the price is =[. But I can notice it being much faster, and also I can see that the Aluminum is great on the Macbook. This Macbook is exactly like a Macbook Mini, if your a student or someone who doesn't need all that powerful graphics but wants to be almost on par with it. This is the Macbook for you.

Just before purchasing my macbook (which is the 2.4 ghz model with 128 gig SSD), I had a Dell Laptop with almost identical specs.  For the PC laptop, within the first day of using it, I got the B.S.O.D. (blue screen of death, aka the blue error screen) 2 times.  After many failed attempts dealing with the cust service (we all know how great Dell C.S. is.. absolutely horrible), I decided to return my Dell laptop and get my first ever macbook.  All I can say is that I've had this laptop for 2 months now and have not had ONE problem with it.  I updated all of the software updates with no problems at all, installed all of my mac programs that I bought with no problems, and pretty much coasted through everything else.  In addition to the problem free experience I've had with this laptop, the programs open up almost instantaneously.  There are no holdups at all and the laptop DOESN'T get hot by just browsing the internet (you guessed it, the Dell laptop got hot just after starting it and use it moderately for 5 minutes).  So, if you're at all curious which Dell laptop I got, it's the studio xps 13, aka M 1340.So, in conclusion, if you're on the fence about getting a macbook, I HIGHLY recommend jumping over and getting it.  I also highly recommend the solid state drive.  It helps with opening up the programs much faster.  So, what are you waiting for...

It's incredible. With faults. That's all I'm going to say for my introduction. Read on.Physical SpecsThe product physically is very sturdy, thanks to the unibody construction. Normally the chassis would normally consist of various small parts. So instead of taking a small piece of aluminum and adding more aluminum, Apple has taking a big piece of aluminum and subtracted from it. Thus creating a sturdy, yet light laptop. I have heard that the aluminum interferes with internet connectivity issues. I do have to say, unfortunately, it is true. I put the Macbook and my old PC laptop side by side, and the PC was able to pick up better frequency and more networks.Now for the multi-touch trackpad. It is made from glass, but it feels like there is a covering on it that doesn't nearly have the friction of glass. Clicking and moving the cursor is very easy and enjoyable, with the very large surface. Right-clicking can be done with by clicking with two fingers or by clicking one of the bottom corners after being manually set. It should also be noted that only the bottom 3/4 of the trackpad is clickable.The multi-touch gestures are fun to use, but are truly unneeded gimmicks that could be done easier with a click.I'll just go through the gestures now.There are 2 finger gestures:The first is scrolling with using two fingers by swiping your fingers vertically or horizontally depending on the page.Secondly you can rotate a picture using two fingers apart and rotating.The third gesture is holding the control button and scrolling vertically to zoom in on a page.And there is one 3-finger gesture:Swipe with three fingers to navigate. You can do this to go forward or back on a page, or changing a picture.Lastly there are 4-finger gestures:Swiping vertically upwards allows you to clear everything off your desktop.Swiping vertically down launches Expose.Swiping horizontally in any direction lets you change and view your running applications, which can also be done with command+tab.On the bottom of the MacBook there is a panel that allows for easy access to your battery and hard drive. This will be handy to many people.The keyboard is just like the Air, with the spaces between the keys. This creates a very nice typing experience, and are backlit if you purchase the 2.4GHz model.A major letdown by Apple is the omission of a FireWire port. This is very disappointing to many people, but doesn't affect me at all. Nowadays the average users don't use FireWire too much. Although I do see this as a major problem for professional applications.There is also a battery life indicator on the side of the base that glows green to show the rounded percentage of your battery.Software and PerformanceOf course the MacBook has the great Mac OS X Leopard software.It is very fast, and has good security.The battery life is advertised to have 5 hours of battery life, but Apple obviously means not being connected to the Internet, and having no applications running. You'll probably get about 4 and a half hours with Safari and other apps running. Unless you have a lot of apps on like me, then you'll maybe have 3 and a half to 4 hours.With the NVidia graphics card, the screen looks pretty good, as do games. I do have to admit, though, the new MacBook Pro screen looks better, especially with blacks. Still, games really pop on the gorgeous glossy screen, unless you are in a bright area. The glossy screen of course attracts bad glares and many noticeable fingerprints. Still, if you are indoors or someplace with low light, the glossy screen is perfect. I mostly use it inside, so I wouldn't trade the beautiful glossy screen. Although for those coffee-shop typing folks, this could be a deal-breaker.Other than these things, Mac OS X is the same, really.ConclusionIf you have purchased a MacBook anytime soon, then I would not suggest you purchase this one. Most of the differences are the physical attributes, and the software is pretty much the same.If you are new to Macs like me, then I would DEFINITELY suggest this phenomenal notebook computer. Of course it does have it's faults, truly I have never used such a simple, enjoyable computer.", "Date": "October 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Cheap Screen, No Firewire, $1300. Huh?", "Author": "Chrissy Goddick", "ReviewID": "RVNAXB5OEQ3J6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I don't know what Apple is doing these days. They go on and on about how great the new one-piece machined 'unibody' construction is on these new Macbooks, but then they go and mess up on some really important basics.1) No Firewire- Hey, this is an APPLE technology. They created it, and supported it for years. Lots of people used it, lots of people loved it. Now, all of a sudden, it's GONE from the Macbook line, except for one old plastic model that isn't going to be around much longer. Why? So if you need it, you can go shell out $2000 for a Macbook Pro? Just not a great way to treat your customers, particularly long-time ones.2) Trackpad issues - Hey, the new trackpad is bigger and all-glass. Cool. There's no button anymore, the trackpad is the button now. Cool, I guess. Some of these new trackpads don't always work right... they don't always register clicks, the cursor sometimes moves with a life of its own, making it very hard to select menu items, and other bits o' random weirdness. Not cool.Apple says they're going to fix it soon with a software or firmware update. I sure hope so. Because if they can't and it's actually a physical/hardware issue to any significant extent, then we're talking either a massive notebook recall (very inconvenient for affected users), or Apple basically nicely telling us \"it's not that bad\"/suck it.If the latter, you could be stuck with a way-less-than-optimal trackpad, if Apple were to deem this problem not grounds for a return/replacement. Well, depending on how the inevitable consumer lawsuits would shake out, of course. But that would take awhile.So again, if you're one of the ones who got a glitchy trackpad, best hope the upcoming update fixes it. I have some faith in Apple that it will, at least mostly.3) El cheapo screen- The Macbook screen is, to put it nicely, not great. Now, the backlighting is good, much brighter than the old Macbooks. But the screen itself? SUPER-glossy. Apple likes this because it makes the colors 'pop' a bit more, but the price for this is that you get tons of very distracting, annoying reflections [you can use it as a makeup mirror] and oodles of very noticeable smudges, smears, and fingerprints.Also not a fan of the big, space-gobbling black bezel. It increases the footprint while making the small (aka 'barely adequate') 13.3\" screen look even smaller. Check out the previous gen Macbook Pro to see what an appropriately-sized bezel looks like.More importantly though, the viewing angle on the Macbook screen is TINY. Images can look good if your head is positioned PERFECTLY, but move just a bit right or left, or (especially) up or down, and the image goes to heck. If you think that that's \"just the way LCDs are\", compare the Macbook screen to the screen on the MB Pro or even Macbook Air-- neither of those is nearly as 'touchy' in terms of viewing angle as the MB's is, and have much larger 'sweet spots'.Another bit of Macbook screen wackiness is that you have to tilt the screen WAAAY back, almost to horizontal, or blacks will appear washed out. But do that, and you catch ALL the reflections, in glorious super-glossy detail, from any and all overhead lighting. Darned if you do, darned if you don't.Bottom line, the MacBook uses a cheap screen made to seem higher-quality than it really is by super-glossy glass and a very bright backlight. Clever, but not cool. Apple doesn't seem to have really thought through the drawbacks here. Or perhaps they did but didn't care, since they were saving so much $$$ on the screen.4) Speakers - If you love music (and who doesn't?) you're going to be disappointed here. These are some pretty muddy-sounding and quite volume-limited built-in speakers, even by notebook standards. And no, not everyone digs using headphones all the time, or lugging add-on speakers everywhere. The whole idea of a notebook is easy, all-in-one portability.\"Well, whaddya expect for $1300?!\", some might say, inadvertently revealing just how out-of-touch some of us Mac fans can be. Alls I can say is, my friend's ancient (and lots cheaper) iBook sounds better. This is the company that gave us the iPod? Is music a priority or not?5) No card reader, and no internal 3G option - Disappointing, and annoying. Apple's way too in love with minimalism. Enough said.6) Specs - Not great, particularly for the money... little 'bump' over the previous gen. At least the graphics chip is significantly improved, though that was a low bar to pass (the previous gen's Intel integrated graphics were very weak).7) Price - $1300 is a lot for a notebook, especially with the economy heading south.  Apple won't give you any options at all for a 15\" screen or expansion slots even in the high-end part of the Macbook line, which is pretty obnoxious already (again, they want you to cough up the $2000 for the MB Pro). But to ask these prices AND not offer those things AND take away Firewire AND cheap out on the screen (among some other things)??Wowzers. Guess all the money went into the unibody construction.Which makes sense- even Apple has said that the unibody process will be very expensive at first, with its cost dropping over time. If you're acquainted with the previous generation Macbook, you can sort of understand Apple's obsession with the unibody, as the most serious complaints with the previous gen (plastic) MBs were in the areas of poor build-quality and questionable durability. Apple's trying hard to fix that, to their credit. Well that, and I think it strongly appeals to Steve Jobs' well-known aesthetic sensibilities.Jobs (whose health I hope improves) is fairly obsessed with his products having a Jaguar/Mercedes Benz-like 'high end' look and feel.  While that sure sounds cool, it isn't, always. Not when it, plus the build-quality mistakes made with the previous gen, cause Apple to focus obsessively-compulsively on a couple of areas while messing up/cheaping out in so many others.For $1300, the consumer/prosumer rightly expects a great ALL-AROUND notebook. If you look past the surface, this isn't it.On a more hopeful note, with unibody costs dropping, the NEXT Macbook revision may have the budget for a better screen and other improvements, perhaps even better pricing too (yeah I know, good luck). THAT MB could be the great all-arounder so many are looking/hoping for.But even if that happens, the Macbook line will still retain at least one serious flaw going forward, as it's highly doubtful that Apple will reverse its very poor decision to dump Firewire. That's a choice which will continue to screw the hobbyist/video-audio enthusiast crowd, a group that was particularly Mac-loyal (though maybe not as much anymore).Despite the Macbook's drawbacks, don't get me wrong- the new MBs have their strengths: nice looks, should be quite durable, improved graphics card, the included i-Apps are useful and intuitive (as always), OS X is more secure than Windows, et cetera et cetera.  But, it's just not a good value for the money, particularly considering the minuses.Apple really, REALLY needs to listen to its customers more. I'm sure they think they're listening, but something's off there, as the result -this product- doesn't really seem to reflect that, at least not in any balanced way. Lately, it's like they've been building things more to please themselves, and not us.Normally I love Apple, but I'd think long and hard before buying this one.", "Date": "November 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "The best Computer I have owned", "Author": "Nick L \"phnick\"", "ReviewID": "R1LHYFT0LZ4MWL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have \"been a PC\" for all of my life, but I got sick of the windows platform.

I get 4 - 5 hrs straight from my macbook, more than enough time to be away from an area with an electrical outlet.The track pad, is not only for use, but to play. The multi-functionality of the track pad, makes work look like play.

It is only after a while my friend observed that normally we would have to get up to get a good viewing angle, which is straight in front of the screen. The display adjusts to the amount of lighting  in the area, excellent idea.You use the keyboard effectively without accidentally touching the track pad. The back light is one very important feature, and should have been standard just like the battery in all laptops. you just need it all the time.

I needed a new computer, the new macbooks just came out and had good reviews, so...great. I decided to give it a shot because I knew if I ran into trouble I could always run Windows.At first, I went all Mac. I bought the Mac version of Office and Quicken (the two client programs I actually use) and quickly saw that they are awful. The online reviews warned me but they truly are bad. Functional but nowhere near the PC counterparts. I couldn't port my Quicken history, which has more of my time invested than many would consider normal. That's why I purchased Vista. At first I installed it in bootcamp. Easy process but once I got the drivers installed I saw that it wasn't a clean port. The glass \"buttonless\" trackpad functionality wasn't mapped properly. The highlight-drag-n-drop was goofy, the right click functionality was spotty, the scroll speed was jumpy. It was all there but it was driving me nuts.I'm sure Apple will eventually fix the drivers (if they make it possible to install Vista, they should get the kinks out of their drivers), but this is why I decided to wipe it clean and install Vista inside VM Fusion (virtualization software). Very easy, great functionality (trackpad now works like it should) and having everything inside one desktop is great. This setup makes the entire system a little slower (still workable) but it defeats the purpose of the hardware and price points.I was able to install the new versions of Quicken and Office (both great) and finally have the functionality I want. After all was said and done (apple tax, 2 versions of quicken, 2 versions of Office, Vista license, Virtualization software), I'm sure I doubled my cost compared to a decent Windows based laptop. It's a sunk cost for me but hopefully this helps others. If you are hardcore Quicken / Office users, stay with the PC. Vista is fine. If you can stay in the Mac OS entirely, this is a great product.

Although, I have lusted after Mac OS for years, it wasn't practical because most of my work software is Windows. Now, the ability to run Windows on Mac notebooks has changed that and it is possible to have the best of both worlds. Amongst the Windows notebooks, ThinkPad has always been my favorite, and this MacBook is replacing ThinkPad X31.MacBook is fast, feels very solid and sturdy, thin and has bright LED display with vivid colors and fast graphics. Some people are complaining about the glossy screen; but I found glare a problem only with bright light facing the screen. Battery life is decent, about 4 hours. Self adjusting screen brightness, depending upon ambient light, does not work very well and I had to turn it off. Backlit keyboard is excellent. You will like large multi-touch track pad after you get used to it. Two finger scrolling and right click are very convenient. In lot of ways Mac OS is superior than Windows, and especially Vista. Mac OS applications are lot more fun and easier to use, not to mention less crashes, freezes and viruses and malware.Being a migrant from Windows, I miss dedicated PgDn and PgUp keys; it also lacks numLk, Home, End, and Del (forward) keys. Lack of Firewire can be a problem if you do not have another computer with one and need to use it for camcorder etc. Card reader is also absent and it is not easy to transfer camera pictures unless the camera also works as a card reader. Neither is there an express card slot or 3G modem. Cost is definitely a lot more than similarly equipped Windows notebooks. Mac versions of Quicken, Quickbooks, Dragon speech and several others programs are not as good as Windows versions which I have been using under Windows and Fusion. Theoretically you can use Windows on the MacBook but in practice many files saved in one operating system cannot be opened by the other operating system. For example, Windows cannot open many of my photos, documents and spreadsheets saved in MacBook (\"Disk read error\"). Potential Windows migrants really ought to look before they leap into the Mac OS.I feel the ideal weight for a truly mobile computer should be 2-3 lbs and screen 12 inches. 13.3 inch screen has a big footprint and 4.5 lbs is slightly heavy. MacBook Air is not as powerful, is expensive, has smaller hard drive and lacks ports. And the main reason to get MacBook Pro is if you need firewire port and do lot of graphics intensive work. I loved my ThinkPad X31 with 12.4 inch screen, 3 lb weight and all the ports. For me the ideal computer would have been a ThinkPad X200 with Mac OS; I figured that in absence of that, this MacBook could be the next best choice.

I can't believe I had been resisting it for so long - what was I thinking? My 13 inch aluminum Macbook has definitely improved my life!I'm a commercial/editorial photographer, and manage content on a high traffic automotive blog site ([...]) for a living. This Macbook shuts down & wakes up in about 1 second, whereas I'd have to constantly wait for my PC to shut down/start up. This is a big deal to me, because since I multitask like crazy, I'm constantly running late for things and ALWAYS need to leave immediately for meetings, or get last minute info (like mapquest directions, etc) real quickly before I leave.I love how my aluminum Macbook is small, thin, lightweight, stylish, and surprisingly rugged due to the aluminum exterior. I travel ALOT (last year I took an average of 2-3 trips per month) across the USA and internationally, and let me tell you... having a capable, light laptop is a huge deal. Especially one that can do all the things my Macbook can. Photo and video editing, managing playlists, syncing to my iphone, creating webpages on iweb, blah blah you name it.I love that my Mac uses SPACES (it's like having 4 desktops, and keeps things uncluttered.) It lets me use Firefox on desktop #1 (I manage the site through Firefox), Email/addressbook on desktop #2, Photoshop and plugins on desktop #3, and I can have iTunes blaring out my favorite music, while I'm looking through the folders on my Terabyte external HD in Finder (like Windows Explorer) on desktop #4. Spaces keeps my desktop and my mind organized; I love it. I can run my 80000 tabs in different browsers, and I can keep work related tabs/windows separate from random browsing stuff like Facebook, Myspace, Twitter, Yelp, Amazon.com, etc. Perfect if you have ADD like me.Try THAT on a PC. Even a new one. It would explode. I have 2 Toshiba Satellite laptops on my desk, and my Macbook. The smaller, thinner, more efficient Macbook is what I use for most of my web/internet/photoshop tasks... and my POS Toshibas are now only used for dumb, mundane tasks like copying photos off my CF cards to an external drive, checking MS Outlook email, and FTPing files from my external HD to our server.

I have a Time Capsule that two computers share internet connections with. I figured the Macbook airport would just catch the signal and I'd have internet access automatically. It didn't quite happen that way, so I'll spare you wasting your time. At some point while accessing the Time Capsule parameters to join the network, it will prompt you with a screen that says something like, \"Do you have any devices, firewalls, or routers connected to the machine (or something like that). You must click yes (if you have a Time Capsule), then it asks you to restart the machine, and press \"continue\" afterwards. I kept hitting restart on my MacPro instead of restarting my Time Capsule. At the end I unplugged/plugged the Time Capsule and the MacBook picked up the signal %100.

While I work at the office on a Vista Dell machine I decided to go Mac for my travel laptop because nothing impressed me in the Windows world as much as the MacBook did.So after two weeks here is what I like:1. Fit and Finish. No laptop in the Windows world comes close. The aluminum unibody is an engineering marvel and a thing of beauty.(The new laptop coming from Dell very likely will rival the MacBook but we will have to wait and see.)2. Keyboard. A real strength. Very easy to work with. Has good feedback and nice key travel. Silent but responsive. Very very nice. Backlighting on the 250 GB model is very nice but kind of gives a spooky glow as the light leaks out between the keys. Horror film fans will be happy as they wonder what entity is trapped in their keyboards.3. Touchpad. Very intuitive and responsive. A little hard to click but leap years ahead of the current one button or two button pads.4. Very quiet. Truthfully I don't know if it even has a fan. And warm but not hot to the touch. Makes lap work very easy.Here is what I don't like:1. OS. Seems clunky. Also I have had more restarts on this computer then I ever had with my Dell with Vista.2. Screen. Something is fuzzy about it. The settings are there but the clarity is not. Can't put my finger on it.3. Software. Inconsistent. But I have to admit I am pleasantly surprised by the file compatibility between iWorks and MS Office. The computer is limited in software but that is what I expected.4. The magnetic power connect really sticks in there. Sometimes a real pain to disconnect as the end is too small to grab and you end up pulling the cord which you know is going to break sooner or later.5. Speed seems lacklustre. Takes some time to boot programs. Shouldn't. With Vista you blink and you have Word. In the Mac OS you yawn and it might be there.Neutral:1. Battery life. Sure it shows you have five plus hours when you begin with a full charge but I think you would be lucky to get three in real world usage. Power meter drops off pretty quickly. But what do you expect? If you believe the hype then I have a bridge in Brooklyn you can have cheap.Overall:1. Solid machine and feels great in your hands.2. Well balanced for carrying and using.3. OS, Software, and speed average.4. Display is OK but it seems to lack crispness. Most screens in the Windows world really pop. Like air conditioning in North American cars Windows laptop makers know how to create amazing displays. But this display is wholly average. Something is missing.5. Very good machine. But not great. I still look forward to working on my Dell with Vista at the office. And that is exactly what I wasn't expecting to happen.My kids had played this machine up so much I expected it to be great. But then again they bought iphones and then promptly broke or lost them and went to Blackberries - so what do they know?

I am NOT as picky as to use a laptop while walking around, just move my head a little bit produces noticeable artifacts.So when viewing or watching dark toned pictures or videos, ink patches like effect is very obvious, though for more vibrant colored scenes like the factory supplied background pictures and the ones showing in Apple store, with the help of the bright LED backlight and glossy coating, it does not seem to be that bad.The new Macbook is definitely trendy and tremendously good looking as a successful consumer electronic, but the poor quality display will surely diminish its usefulness as any slightly serious tool for photo and video processing, which ironically boasted as the Mac's appeal all along.On the bright side, the Mac OS is very responsive and quick comparing to Windows Vista, thought you may find that the system settings configurable with the UI interface is limited to make the system less complex.

Yet, the proof is in the pudding.  The new MacBook is, frankly, the best consumer laptop Apple has every sold, and I've owned just about all of them.  It's also the finest consumer laptop out there, but, I suppose, I'm repeating myself.  Yes, there are a few folks who elevate the lack of a FireWire port to the kiss of death, or complain about the \"quality\" of the screen, even though it is the same quality screen that made its appearance in the last iteration of the MacBook -- and, more importantly, it's a damn fine screen that no reasonable user could find fault with.  It's bright, vivid and clear, backlit by LEDs that truly make it quick to light up, easy on the eyes, and a beautiful display for watching videos or slide shows.  Those who complain are a lot like the folks who could be convinced that tap water is actually Norwegian glacier drippings, or that hand-rolled oregano is a joint.  Finding fault with the screen is just plain silly.  But, don't trust me.  Truck down to your local Apple store and take  a look for yourself.  It will really blow you away.  And as for FireWire, it would be a more versatile laptop if it was included, since a lot of older camcorders are FireWire only, and, as of yet, there is no FIreWire to USB 2 converter available to consumers.  My guess is that there will be in short order, but that's for another day.  So, if you really want to do FireWire downloading to your Mac, get an iMac or a MacBook Pro.  Simple as that.But, here's why those petty complaints don't mean a tinker's cuss. First, this is a rock solid laptop, pressed from a solid block of aluminum and virtually scratch-proof.  It's expensive to produce this kind of light rigidity (no one else machines their laptops from aircraft grade aluminum), but it turns out to be indispensable for a workhorse portable. The MacBook opens and closes and feels like a fine Swiss watch. Going from the MacBook to any of its competitors is like going from fine Japanese or German sports car to a Chevy Impala -- the kind with chintzy appointments and cheap doors.  The kind that folds up in a crash.  Are you going to pay a bit of a premium for that kind of quality? Sure. But, even with this kind of off the charts fit and finish, the MacBook only costs $1299 -- and you can get an Apple certified refurbished unit for hundreds less.  But here's the real beauty part.  Apple laptops hold their value -- just like Hondas and Toyotas. I trade mine in every two years to get the latest and greatest, and usually get more than 50% of the purchase price in a trade in.  Try that with your Dell or HP.  They'll laugh you out of the computer store, and then the best you'll be able to do is to try to sell it as a commodity product on eBay for parts, maybe.But, apart from the terrific screen and off-the-charts build, you get an amazingly solid operating system that virtually never crashes. Sometimes an application with quit on you, but even that's rare.  And the OS X just keeps on keeping on. It's a thing of beauty, and the next version (Snow Leopard) is designed to take advantage of the MacBook's architecture to achieve blazing speed.  Not that the current version (Leopard) isn't plenty fast. It is. And then you have software programs have no equal in the Windows world for both elegance and ease of use. Just give OmniGraffle or Keynote a try if you don't believe me. Sure, there are some specialty Windows programs that aren't available for OS X.  No problem.  You can run Windows on your MacBook -- either by directly booting into it, or via fine emulation programs like Fusion.  Note: If you want to run heavy duty games, you probably should drop a few hundred more bucks for the MacBook Pro.  But, since most of those games suck, and are better off being played on a console or desktop computer, why bother?Seamless integration with your iPod or iPhone, the great, exclusive software, a crash-proof operating system, and a beautiful design of both strength and lasting beauty ... don't listen to the MacBook bashers here. They truly have no clue as to what counts in a laptop or what consumers both need and want.  Frankly, I think they're just looking for attention, and to rally around some irrational clinging to their Windows laptops which they probably got on the cheap (you get what you pay for) or paid too much for and got little in return.", "Date": "January 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "very bed", "Author": "not good", "ReviewID": "RLAWWLIL90BOU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "used not riferbeshed demeged, horebol dont like it at all stay away, wish i can return it.now i'm out of 750 $", "Date": "June 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "i have NOT received my $50 rebate  from amazon", "Author": "sb", "ReviewID": "R2FWY73YVZUU6P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i ordered this item december 23, 2008,received the item the next day,completed the rebate process online,got a reference number for the completion,got an email in a month or so from amazon that the rebate was \"approved of\",called amazon more than five times as i haven't seen the rebate,only to be told1) i didn't complete the process,2) the rebate was on the way,3) i would have to call the \"rebate center\" (that is NOT part of amazon) where i got irrelevant recorded messages and no real person to talk to,4) i would receive it in a week or two since i indeed completed the required process,5) i would get an email from amazon with \"complete information\" about the rebate.i went to the order information page in my amazon account and there is NO way to contact amazon with this issue but to call.so here it is.amazon will probably block this review, as well.but i will NOT go away, Amazon, until i get my rebate and your reasonable explanation for this otherwise shameful practice of yours.stay tuned.", "Date": "April 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "I'm a PC & a MAC.", "Author": "L. Olson \"olsonl13\"", "ReviewID": "R1V94VQFY4EPMH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned and built many PC's. I use them daily. I have been using Macs since the Apple II GS but stopped because of the price and software in the early 2000's. Since OS X and the switch to Intel the Mac is finally back to being a great computer. I really appreciate the Green efforts Apple is making too.Remember the first iBook. That thing was ugly. It was low powered and was a pain to use. Those days are long gone. The New MacBook is Gorgeous and blazing fast. This is a big step up from the last Macbook. For me the multi-touch trackpad alone makes this one of the best computers to use. No other software and hardware comes close to matching the ease of use. I like it so much I wish I could get it with an iMac. Some people won't like the changes but I love them. The improved graphics and overall design is fantastic. The glossy screen pops more than the previous model as long as you can avoid glare and the lack of firewire and the old video ports won't be missed by me.The Apple MacBook Pro MB471LL/A 15.4-Inch Laptop (2.53 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor, 4 GB RAM, 320 GB Hard Drive, Slot Loading SuperDrive) is a better machine (I own one and it's my favorite computer so far) and has all the pro features you'd expect as well as a \"Pro\" price tag. If you plan on doing heavy video or Photoshop you need at least 4GB RAM. I don't play games and have not needed to use the better graphics card. Don't worry about graphics card power for Photoshop, a fast Hard Drive and lots of RAM will help more. So far I love the LED backlight glossy screen, which is better then the 13 inch Macbooks. I tend to work in dark environments.I'd love to see the DVD drive go away and have more hard drive space and have 3G/4G mobile internet access. But they will most likely do that with the Macbook Air first, it's already half way there.Some things that I dislike are the monitor, which should be better, I hear it has been recently upgraded. And the lack of firewire is dissapointing but I have it on other machines. Also the back-lit keyboard should be standard. They should give you the Apple Remote too. It is really cool to use with the new Hulu software.One of things that took me some time to get used to was the use of Expose to manage windows, let's you see all your open windows. I got so used to the taskbar in Windows I really wanted every window to live down there. I also was used to the old window shade trick in the older Macs. Now that I'm using the new trackpad I wish windows would learn some new tricks. I also love the feature, Spaces, that let's you have more than one desktop.If you decide to buy a PC use the money you save to buy Windows 7 when it comes out. I'm running it on my 5 year old HP laptop with 512MB RAM and it beats all other Windows OS hands down. So if you are a die hard Windows fan wait for Windows 7. Otherwise get a Mac with OSX 10.5, the best money can buy. Of course you could buy the Mac and install windows on it too.If you don't need a laptop the iMacs make great machines with more hard drive space. I find I'm using more and more Hard Drive space for music, movies and photos as their quality increases. I also have a Time Capsule and love it. I use all my PC's and Macs with it and have had no problems.I also am testing out Apple's MobileMe service. So far my favorite feature is that I can access my external hard drive attached to my Time Capsule anytime I'm on the internet. I also really like the ease of making websites and posting them with password protection. The amazon price for .me is much better then Apple's so I think it will be worth the investment. I'm going to wait since I still have a month left of testing. I also plan to get the new iPhone to test it with it.Please note that Macs are NOT perfect machines. I do tend to have less issues with my Macs and more enjoyment from using them. My poor tricked out PC just doesn't get the time of day anymore.

I usually don't buy first gen, but needed a new laptop at the right time (actually thought I'd get a discounted macbook pro after Apple's new product line) and was amazed at the overall elegance of not just the design of the computer but everything from the frontside bus & ram clock speed to the switchable hard drive, standard super drive and in the 3 days I've had it, the joy of the touch pad.Every laptop I've had, I've always hooked up a mouse at home cause I hated the trackpad of all brands (pc's with their double click make me feel like I'm wearing mittens).But the new touchpad is already intuitive, in fact a mouse would feel more uncomfortable. I can set how I want to right click (even if that was all it did I'd cheer) The keyboard's great.  So far it's easily the quietest, coolest (as in temperature) laptop I've ever used.Yeah, it doesn't have a firewire port but since I bought this as a personal computer and don't have any firewire video cameras (hey if you're buying laptops as soon as they're released, you're probably up to date on what cameras you're using).And it has a glossy screen.  I like the way the led (light emitting diode screen) really jumps at you, but i suppose if I take it on a picnic, I'll have to find a shady tree so I can ruin my picnic and work on my computer.Again, if you're not going to use this macbook as an intensive professional systems & networking tool (and if that's what you use computers for get the macbook PRO (as in professional) but feel free to snicker at me.  I'll be too immersed in my macbook to pay attention.If next year Apple or anybody finally creates a laptop that serves all users, is infinitely upgradeable, a 1/4\" thin and 8 ounces & has card slots, an sata port, 3200 firewire, ethernet, direct rca digital cable input, then I'll know I shoulda waited.Oh by the way, the new speakers are actually pretty good, that is to say a 1000 times better than the previous models.", "Date": "October 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Machine", "Author": "A.

The Firewire is a non-issue for me.There are two faults with this machine.1. The display should be better for this price. Overall it's a decent display, But the blacks arn't black. Apple really skimped on this display. If you use Supercal and calibrate your screen, you can lose the washout effect and it helps a lot. But the blacks are nearly unforgivable. I'm personally going to question any of Apples new products due to this one mistake.2. Overpriced! For what you get, I'm not sure it's worth it. The look is amazing, but performance lags compared to machines hundreds cheaper. Apple products have always carried a premium, but this is getting out of hand. My two year old MBP 2GHz machine is only slightly slower than this one.Overall I guess I'm pretty happy about this laptop. But Apple has lost my trust. They skimped on the display that they talked up during the release. They are going to need to earn my trust back, if they want a penny more from me. I ordered this product assuming I would get a quality product that I was willing to pay a premium for. Instead I get a very nice looking laptop with little substance that I paid a premium for.

Nice piece of artwork. But I'm shocked by the catastrophic font display and apparent lack of adjustment options (yes, seen the font smoothing option but the result's a joke with or without). I've read many posts on how apple's rendering is different from Windows, how exactly they manage to put so much thought into creating such a poor result, and how people prefer one or the other. But this seems just plain wrong -- I can't believe that there's so many people out there who, out of pure love for original font geometry (or for love of Apple), are willing to sacrifice readability/usability.There's some other disappointing surprises for someone who switches from Windows:- no easy window maximise/minimise, maximisation only via green button that maximises to the layout Apple considers best (I'd often prefer a different window size, mostly full screen, particularly on 13\"). That means you end up using the mouse & moving/changing windows all the time.- very inefficient handling of screen real estate. Lots of permanently displayed info / top menu rows etc that you really don't need most of the time and that cut down usable screen area. Maybe I just haven't found it yet, but I don't see an easy way to switch to full screen.- sharp front edge on the unibody... that's very uncomfortable after a short while. Somewhere else I read that for Apple, clearly function follows form. That strikes me as spot on now...- Yes, you can soft-double-tap the large mouse pad, but if you decide to mechanically click it (you can do that anywhere on the pad), the sound of the mechanics is annoyingly loud.Bottom line: I feel mislead by a good amount of (unjustified) enthusiasm of the Apple fans around me.

It's almost impossible to not be distracted by reflections when working with it, which causes eye-strain, fatigue, and maybe more serious ocular problems.

I spent a great deal of money on this, but the previous Macbook 2.4 for the same amount of money has a lot more power in benchmark tests than this one.  It has no firewire power which is really stupid.  Even a $500 Dell has that.  The previous Macbook had it.

The MacBook and OS Leopard make Microsoft products seem efficient, intuitive, and logical by comparison. I've had mine a month now, and I'm a reasonably intelligent person, so it is fair to say I've given it all the chance an average person should.  I look forward to using it as a $2K aluminum frisbee very soon.  Examples:I recently spent a 4-hour cross-country flight trying to get the word processor to let me expand the default working window from 5\" to a more full=screen adult size.  But you can't do that.  Apparently MacApple also doesn't want you to be able to re-name files, or move them around among folders.  Even deleting them is not a one-key process, you have to drag them here, drag them there, play miniature golf with them, just to get them in the \"trash.\"But backing up a couple of weeks; right out of the box, most programs started out with some kind of error message.  \"Hold on there, you can't do that, who do you think you are\"  So I had to burrow dep into the settings and preferences to try to reset things to get Garage Band, iPhoto, iMovie, iTunes etc, to run at the basic level.  And oh by the way, all \"Help\" menus are online, so you must be connected to the internet to use them.  That's a problem when your problem is that the MacBook won't connect to the internet.  So there went another weekend for me,  wandering through settings and preferences in weirdly arranged menus, trying to set the computer to the most obvious basic settings to get it online.  What sold me on Macs was the reputation that everything about them is \"plug and play.\"  My experience is that almost nothing is.Now it won't let me send emails while I'm on the road.And the trackpad is going bad, after 4 weeks of service.When the CD drive ejects a disc, it sounds like somebody folding a CD jewel case in their hands until it snaps into pieces.  I sense big trouble in there soon.So: I spent big money experimenting with the switch from PC to Mac.  I used to keep a Bill Gates Voodo doll on my desk, sticking pins in it everytime I ran into some typical PC dysfuncion.  But now Apple has made me a big fan of PCs.
