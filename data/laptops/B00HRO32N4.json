It has been a great replacement for my old Inspiron 1545 and I love the touch screen feature, it feels like a big version of my windows Tablet and it is running Windows 8.1 Pro. Very fast and find myself working on it more than I did my old one because it\u2019s so neat to just reach up and touch to zoom and slide through pages whether it is my emails in Outlook, long PDF documents or website pages, even the programs screen on the live blinds pages. The screen is not glass which os a plus. I am an IT guy and have owned my business not for the past 10 years I highly recommend this computer.", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "first very satified ... now disappointed ....", "Author": "GPawiro", "ReviewID": "R1LVS8ZPWK172S", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I love this machine. Fast and is beyond my expectations. The touchscreen is working very nice. you can handle a lot programs smoothly.I update this review after having problem with the machine. It has been 6 weeks since i received the laptop.It worked fine, But suddenly the machine did not want to start up. No led and nothing. It was completely dead.I searched the internet for resolution. Detach battery , detach power cable, hold power button at least 10 seconds. then connect battery and power cable. Start up. Yes. But only 3 seconds. And again dead. Unconnected the battery again and the power cable. Left the machine till the next day without battery connected. Reconnect and started up. Yes it started. !!!. My happiness was only for two days. The laptop died again. Made contact with the seller, they told me to contact the manufacturer Dell. And yes. Their support was very good. They will send me a new system board to be replaced.I will update my review when system board is replaced", "Date": "April 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Satisfied...", "Author": "suresh babu korrapati", "ReviewID": "R1VBZ8SAH7EE10", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am totally satisfied with this product and i recommend this product,as it is working as per my expectations .", "Date": "June 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "nicely built.", "Author": "Michael Denney", "ReviewID": "R11MTFCN6GNBKN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Except for getting used to Windows 8 this has been a fun experience.

I've had this computer roughly a month and complete dissatified with it. When I received the computer and initiated start-up, apparently all of this malware upload that I had to take it to Geek Squad to fix it within the first week of owning the computer. The computer is not fast at all, so expect to spend time waiting, and waiting for a webpage to upload. I tried to watch a video lecture that kept buffering every few secs that I just gave up on watching the video. Honestly I'm disappointed in this computer and this will be that last time I purchase a dell computer.", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Just what I wanted", "Author": "T. Eggers", "ReviewID": "R3KJB06WRCH84K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a larger faster touchscreen laptop for my business needs. I like the 10\" and 11\" touchscreen netbooks ,but needed a bigger screen for my office work and this suites me very well. It has a DVD drive that the other ones in this size don't have and 3 usb ports, one being for 3.0.I'm a windows 7 user so there is a learning curve to adjust to windows 8 but with the combination touchscreen and usual desktop for me it is the best of both worlds. The processor and RAM are very good so for me there is minimal lag and the 15.6\" screen looks good and is easy to see. I did buy a wireless mouse to use as well for mouse duties so I can use both touchscreen and mouse, so I don't know how responsive the mouse pad is, but I'm sure it is adequate as well.", "Date": "May 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Dell Inspiron Touchscreen Laptop (i15RMT-5124sLV)", "Author": "Laurel Ann", "ReviewID": "R32DEVLY44APPI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Big learning curve.
