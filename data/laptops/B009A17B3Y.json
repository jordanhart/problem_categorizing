The top of the page says the computer has Windows NT operating system and the bottom said Windows 8. I took a chance and ordered the computer and I LOVE it.Its very fast and picture quality is amazing. I love that it has an HDMI output. My only computer only had VGA. The difference in streaming video on the computer and onto the tv is amazing.Windows 8 is taking a little while to get used to. I was using Windows 7 previously but I'm starting to get the hang of it.The laptop is light weight, sleek and the keyboard feels good on your hands. Overall I def recommend this product. I think everyone will love it!", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "patterson", "ReviewID": "R3OHH0OP3ZGKB2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "recieved my computer in only 2 business days. and love it so far.

Taylor", "ReviewID": "R3FBB5L0C4F0E0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recommend this laptop.Used exclusively for work to demonstrate videos and photos to customers... play internet radio. It's fast enough with adequate memory and speed for what I use it for. Arrived on time (Prime is worth getting if you use Amazon a lot pay over $80 in shipping a year).This is my 2nd HP and the other (HP G6) is still doing fine (8GB RAM)... I upgraded to 8GB RAM through Crucial [dot ]com and it runs over 12 hours a day and has been doing so since Fall of 2011. This model (4GB RAM) is capable of 8GB RAM for even better performance. Note that this comes with Windows 8 and I think runs better than my G6 where I upgraded from Win 7.Get these 2 modules:Crucial CT3695417or Kingston or Corsair... all available from Amazon.comOpen the access area... battery compartment or entire bottom of the laptop, locate where the RAM slot is, remove the existing module by pressing down on the retaining clips, remove the module, get the new module and line up the notch in the row of metal pins at the bottom of your module with the key in the SODIMM slot on your motherboard. (If the notch doesn't line up right away, flip your module around and try it the other way. It doesn't matter which side of your module has the black chips or the stickers on it. The important thing is to line up the notch.)Hold the module at a 45-degree angle to the slot and slide it into place. No more than 1/16\" of the gold contacts should be showing when the module is properly seated in the slot.MODULE:FEATURE: DDR3 PC3-10600, DDR3 PC3-12800SPECS FOR RAM: NON-ECC * DDR3-1333 * 1.35V * 512Meg x 64", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poor Service", "Author": "Betty Ann Williams", "ReviewID": "R2I1YV08S6XHWW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this system on June 1, 2013 and received it approximately 2.5 weeks later.less than three months later the speakers stopped working and the system crashed. i thought i purchased a new system.when i contacted the seller etrador2008 i was told to contact hp directly.i will never purchase anything from etrador2008 again and i advise others to do the same.", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pleasant suprise", "Author": "Steven M Usarzewicz", "ReviewID": "R2NQB8M52AMJQ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've always been a Toshiba guy but couldn't pass up the price point when i went to replace my 4 year old Satellite.

The price point is really excellent, so for a college laptop or business travel laptop--or even replacing a desktop for most people, this is quite a good PC. Some of the accessories like webcam, optical drive are excellent at this price. So this is a fully-functional PC, but with some limitations for special use, like intensive gaming, video editing and heavy multi-tasking. If you are an average user who just watches HD movies and does regular computing tasks, this budget PC has a lot to offer for the price.Features:1. 15\" screen is not a bad size. Not the largest you can get, but this makes the unit a compact size.2. Not really what you'd want for gaming due to the processor but I don't do any gaming.3. Screen: Has a 15 inch screen, maximum screen resolution 1366 X 768 pixels4. Memory: 4 GB DIMM. Not a lot--simply sufficient (esp if all you do is internet, email, some documents in Word and a few spreadsheets) Not expandable5. CPU Processor:  AMD Celeron E1200 1.4 GHz processor. This is a low-end processor which is why it's not great for gaming but you won't notice any problems with basic tasks. You WILL notice it if you do multi-tasking (open a few windows and run several programs simultaneously--or load in a number of photos to Photoshop Elements for editing--or try to edit a video. Then you'll see the issue with a slower processor.)6. Size: Compact. If you travel a lot, and what you do is access internet, make PowerPoint slides, this is great for the carryon. It's about 14 by 19 inches and 3 inches thick. Not the thinnest around but compact. Weighs about 5 lbs.7. Video features:  HD TrueVision, so viewing movies works great. HD Webcam, good for skyping, etc. Altec-Lansing dual speakers. Headphone jack and mic. SuperMulti DVD optical drive/burner.8. Graphics:  AMD Radeon HD 7310 Discrete-Class Graphics  1972MB total graphics memory7. Hard drive 320GB.8. Battery life around 4 hoursSummary: good, solid, inexpensive, nice-looking (shiny black) laptop works for travel, internet, webcam & skyping, watching movies, regular business tasks like Word, Spreadsheets, Powerpoint.  For gaming, graphics-intensive and multi-tasking computing, not enough power.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "Chrissy Blessing", "ReviewID": "R3913ATTJ00MX1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this computer!
