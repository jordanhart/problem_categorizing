{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Overall, nice purchase", "Author": "Mandy Schmidt", "ReviewID": "R1MUTV53Q0OJK0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The HP Envy is a nice ultrabook. It is light, fast, has nice features, audio is good. My only real complaints are the glare from the computer screen in all kinds of natural light and the smudging that occurs everywhere on the ultrabook. In any natural light, even indoors there is a glare on the screen causing it to be difficult to read. I am looking into an anti-glare screen protector to prevent this. As for the smudging there isnt a whole lot you can do. Just use a rag to clean off all the oils from your hands.Also, when I called for technical assistance, they had to pass me along to about 3 or 4 different technicians because the laptop is a specialty model and needed further assistance. I got the information I needed but took a bit of time to receive it.", "Date": "May 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fine computer, so-so screen", "Author": "HGadget \"HG\"", "ReviewID": "R35HNMO5ETCEF6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I got this computer I was impressed by much of it.  it was light, sleek, and fast.  It's backlit keys were a big plus, much like on the MacBook.  The trackpad worked fine.  My biggest drawback, and it's not inconsequential, is the quality of the screen.  The resolution is only so-so and you could easily be looking at a screen on a computer from many years ago, it just doesn't compare well to newer laptops in resolution or color purity.  That said, it's also much less expensive than the laptops I'm referring to, namely MacBooks.  So if you're looking for a good, solid, lightweight Ultrabook with excellent battery life at a righteous price ($650-$700 range) you could be very happy with this machine.", "Date": "February 7, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B008C7C1E6"}}
