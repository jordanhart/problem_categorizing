Also let it be known that I am not some average crackpot home studio enthusiast.  I also work directly with one of the named DAW manufacturers.  This laptop has it all and isn't even remotely new.  This core2duo on win7 running protools 10 / cubase / nuendo gets near the same dsp performance as a quad core i7 macbook.  I will run the same sessions side by side and I can keep up no problem with an os x quad core i7.  I also plan to run this laptop with a magma chassis HD rig.as for the seller, they were responsive inquiries and got the laptop here quickly.  It was in great condition considering its age.Swapped out the drive for two 256gb SSDs and a 750gb black drive.  Running 128 channels of audio and this laptop used cost less than $240.00. Ridiculously happy.", "Date": "February 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best mobile workstation/gaming laptop for the money", "Author": "Igor", "ReviewID": "R1QAQL7NUYFAST", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update 9/19/2013:Even though it is a 2009 model, this laptop is still a capable performer. It has more than enough muscle for office- or school-work. For several years I owned it, the laptop has never let me down and has been a dependable workhorse. I think it is a great bargain if you can find one in good condition.However, it shows its age in more demanding applications and is noticeably slower than newer HP/Dell business laptops equipped with Intel Sandy Bridge - Ivy Bridge processors and much more potent video cards. Also, being about 4-years-old, the battery has less capacity than it used to. So, be prepared that you might need a new battery soon.If you decide to buy this laptop, I would recommend upgrading the harddrive to a SSD (like Intel 335 or Samsung 840 Pro).Original Review 5/08/2011:I bought this laptop 2 years ago to use for my Graduate School and as my main home/entertainment/gaming computer. It came with the following specs:* Intel P8600 2.4GHz Processor,* 4 GB of Ram,* 320 GB 7200 rpm Hard Drive,* ATI Radeon HD 3650 Graphics,* Widescreen 1280x800 anti-glare display,* LightScribe DVD+/-RWThe body of the laptop is made of aluminum and hard plastic with a very rigid magnesium alloy inner frame. This thing is built like a tank and looks like it can stop a bullet. It is absolutely unbendable and practically unscratchable. At the same time it is not too heavy - a little over 6 lb. It also looks very cool - very like a Macbook Pro. There are no reflective or glossy parts anywhere, so it is easy to keep the laptop clean.I installed Windows 7 Pro x64, MS Office Pro 2010, Firefox 4, Adobe CS5, Becker CPA Review Software, Avast Antivirus, and several other productivity programs. The system is very stable - I have never had any problem.I usually keep a dozen Firefox tabs and Office documents open, Windows Media Player playing music, and also work with Adobe or Becker. No sweat. The application performance is very good thanks to the fast processor and speedy 7k HDD. Adobe Suit of course is a resource hog but still works reasonably fast on this computer.I also installed Crysis, Left 4 Dead, SC2, Bishock, and several other games. All the games (except Crysis) run smoothly on medium settings at the native screen resolution. Crysis is playable on low settings only. Older games like Warcraft 3 run on the highest settings. The laptop does not get too hot and the fan is quiet.The battery easily lasts 4 hrs when browsing Internet and working with the Office and/or Becker with Wi-Fi on and the screen on medium brightness. So, I think that performance of ATI Radeon HD 3650 is a good compromise between the power and mobility.The screen is perfect for office/school work and gaming. It is bright, non-reflective and has good contrast. The resolution of 1280x800 is also very suitable for these tasks. The higher resolution would make text appear too small and would not let newer games to be playable in the native resolution. However, as an avid photographer, I would like to have more resolution to work with my pictures.There is a high resolution (2mp) Web camera and a very good built-in microphone. So, Skype is pleasure to use. The built-in speakers are good and clear, though I usually use external speakers or headphones.The illuminated keyboard (there is a very cool built-in light) is very comfortable and quiet - one of the best I have ever used. I like the touchpad too - it is very responsive with the soft and quiet buttons. There is an amazingly accurate pointstick - IBM/Lenovo Thinkpad style - with its own dedicated buttons. There are several touch-sensitive media buttons above the keyboard: Info, WiFi Toggle, Presentation Mode, Sound Volume and Mute. Very sleek. The fingerprint reader adds security.There are lots of connectivity options here:* Docking port on the bottom - extremely convenient, I use it every day to connect the laptop to a docking station.* A/B/G/N Wireless LAN which works flawlessly with my campus network,* 10/100/1000 NIC port - use it to connect to a DSL modem at home* Bluetooth 2.0 EDR - often use it to connect the computer to my cell phone,* 56k modem - used once when I took the laptop to Ukraine,* 4x USB 2.0 ports,* Very fast ESATA port - use it for back-ups with my external HDD,* 1394 Firewire port - never used it,* 1x Headphone out + 1x Microphone in* HDMI port - connect it to my big HDTV* VGA out - used it several times to connect the laptop to a projector during presentations* SD/MS/Pro-MMC Card Reader - use it a lot to transfer pictures from my DSLR* Express card slot + Smart Card slot - never used themAll the ports are located very conveniently with the Power Socket and the VGA on the back, 2 USB and Network on the far left edge, and the rest in the middle of the sides. So, the cables that are most likely to be connected (and the thickest ones) are on the back and do not get in the way. But I use the docking port on the bottom (unique to business laptops) to connect all wires to the dock (and move them all back at the same time) and then connect/disconnect the laptop with a single push on a button. Priceless!Long story short - I am very satisfied.", "Date": "May 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Poor long term reliability", "Author": "Task", "ReviewID": "R367KTWEOR0YVV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "These laptops have what looks like good hardware with a Core 2 Duo processor, ATI graphics, and 2GB of RAM. That said, I work in a library system that ordered 20 of them for use at the branches about 5-6 years ago and ALL OF THEM are now getting memory errors. It's rare enough for RAM to go bad, but for it to go bad on 20 computers that are all the same model, using the same RAM, can NOT be a coincidence. Clearly HP cheaped out on memory and must have just slapped an HP sticker on generic RAM before shoving it into these laptops.The following info will be more beneficial to IT professionals like myself.For those who are curious, I ran memtest on all the machines when staff at various branches were complaining about blue screens and freezing. 18 of the 20 machines failed to even make 2 passes in Memtest.Aside from that, the BIOS are terrible. I think they were trying to cater to people who wanted BIOS that were mouse compatible, but they really screwed up on this. Boot devices are difficult to manage. Even if you enable every boot device imaginable, when you start the computer, and go to the boot menu, you will only have two options: Internal Hard drive and \"upgrade bay\" which is what they put for ANY other boot device including CDs, flash drives, etc. If you are booting from an external hard drive or flash drive, you will NOT have the option to select which device to boot from if you have more than one attached. That means, if you are booting from a flash drive, and also have an external hard drive attached, you have to hope that when you choose something other than the internal hard drive, that the computer randomly chooses the correct device.These laptops have horrible compatibility issues with Ghost 11 and 15 and likely other versions as well. If you believe you will EVER have to use Norton Ghost to backup or reimage your laptop, do NOT buy this model.I would also recommend people avoid HP/Compaq laptops in general, as they are known to have poor reliability. Do your research and purchase from a more reliable manufacturer.", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Laptop", "Author": "John T.
