{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Track pad, wireless, and sleep issues", "Author": "hobbes25", "ReviewID": "R1SNNQOBXEHH5O", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've been using a Lenovo Thinkpad Edge for the last two years for work and love it. So I bought my wife the Ideapad z580 the other day. For the money you can't get better specs. Intel core i5 processor, 8gb Ram, 750gb hardrive were included in a $499 deal at Staples. The other laptops of similar spec were at least $100 more and then some. The feel and handle of the z580 are great. But there are some key problems with this computer that have caused us to return it in favor of something else.1. The track pad doesn't have separate buttons, they are integrated. I don't care one way or the other, but they have to work. The buttons seemed to work only half of the time. I soon just started to tap on the pad to select things because the buttons wouldn't do it. I even tried to adjust the sensitivity of them to no avail. It's also super sensitive. If you even remotely touch anything other than your finger to it, the pointer jumps all over. It also seemed to select things when our fingers hovered over the track pad. For me, the track pad has to work well since you use it for everything. If it doesn't it'll make your computer experience a disaster.2. The network card would lose signal and we would have to reset the connection. This is unacceptable as well.3. The computer, if left open goes into sleep mode, which is fine, but the problem is that it won't wake up. The only way to wake up the z580 if it goes to sleep with the screen open is to push the power button and restart the computer. There is no fix for this per the user forums about this laptop.Between the poor track pad, poor internet network card, and a computer that you can't wake up; it made our decision to return it and look for something else pretty easy. those things just make the laptop experience miserable.", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "horrible trackpad", "Author": "J. Fujino \"bookworm\"", "ReviewID": "R3L64ZPN3CU013", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I never thought I'd say this but the trackpad alone is reason enough you should not buy this laptop.  It is the worst design I have seen in any of the half dozen laptops I've owned.  It is way larger than most trackpads making it far too easy to bump when typing.  Additonally, as others have noted the integrated buttons don't work properly.  Whenever I'm trying to right click on something the computer keeps left clicking.  Usually there's this perfect sweepspot to the far left, but it doesn't work consistently.  I think the designers must have realized midway through that you'd wind up using a mouse all the time because they put a shortcut key (Function-F6) to turn off the trackpad, which I now do all the time.", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "WARNING: CHOOSE YOUR OWN REPAIR PLACE!!!

Great sound from the built-in speakers.  Quick boot up times and plenty of RAM for any student and the occasional video game.  HDMI-out port for playing movies and Karaoke on the TV.  Windows 8 is awesome in my opinion.
