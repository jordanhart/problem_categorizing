{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome Laptop!!", "Author": "dbanimate", "ReviewID": "R2IR5RX7FX2OJU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you can swing the price tag, definitely go for it! (Yes, it`s pricey, eek! but compared to what you'd pay to get all this on a Mac, it's pretty reasonable.) I did a TON of research and this was the best computer I found that had all the bells and whistles I was looking for. (The XPS 15 is great too, but if you can do it, go for the bigger screen and the extra toys - it's worth it!)I came close to getting the HP Envy 17-2070nr instead, because the design is a lot prettier, but the screen on the Dell in my opinion is superior - so crisp and clear with rich vibrant color - just beautiful - as compared to the HP's more washed out colors, so that's what made me finally opt for the Dell.Touchpad - I've heard people complain about the two finger scroll, but you can adjust it to one finger scroll on the right hand side where its more comfortable. Sensitivity is terrific and the pad is nice and large.Heat issues - If you keep it on a flat surface it's stays cool. I haven't had any problems - by raising it up a hair, it runs even cooler than my desktop.  If you want to mostly use it in your lap, go for something smaller/more portable.)Backlit Keyboard - wonderful... The HP was a bit dim and backlit just around the keys, whereas here the keys themselves are lit up and you can adjust the brightness settings.Keyboard - The 17\" comes with the full keypad (includes the numeric pad which the 15\" doesn`t have) and with the brushed aluminum finish where your palms rest, it's so smooth and soft to type on - really a pleasure.Battery Life - not great, but I'm not doing a lot of power saving features - I use full screen and no sleep mode, etc., so you may have better results with different settings.DVD/BluRay - Slide loading rather than the tray would have been nice, but I've heard people say they're more difficult to repair. Picture quality is beautiful for both - haven't used the 3D yet.Speakers - I confess, I'm not as wowed as everyone else seems to be. They are better than most other laptops I've heard, but overall I think laptop speakers have a long way to go. The speaker design on the XPS 17 is nicer than the 15, where they kind of look like weird grills on either side. These are integrated better to the left and right of the palm rest.General Adjustments - I've had zero issues so far (yay!) but I did make a few adjustments based on issues other people had, like  not being able to \"wake up\" the screen or black screen...I changed the settings so it never falls into sleep or stand-by mode, and changed the windows updates to \"ask me before installing.\" This is important because letting updates work on auto-pilot can cause problems.Cosmetics - As mentioned above, the HP was a lot prettier, but Dell had the upper hand most everywhere else, so I opted for the ugly duckling, lol.  It's not horrid looking, it's just sort of industrial and plain, but the brushed aluminum finish is really nice and it is very solid, well built. Sony Vaio was nicely loaded, but it looked cheap/flimsy in person and if I'm paying over $1,000 for a computer I want something substantial. Toshiba Satellite was nice overall, but lacked the backlit keyboard and the vibrant screen. All the models are super speedy and you get that info from looking at the specs.So there's all my reasons why I recommend the Dell. I got kinda wordy here, but these area the types of reviews I appreciated when I was looking for a new laptop, so I hope this helps! :)", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wow", "Author": "Brian \"reviewer\"", "ReviewID": "R1VTZPSDUOTQ3G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Super powerful system - Dell sells these anywhere from $1500-$2000 so you can get a pretty good deal at Amazon.  Bought mine from a third party seller and couldn't be more satisfied.  This thing screams and the benchmarks are ever better than my desktop that's only about a year old.  This laptop should last at minimum a few years without having to worry about upgrading.  Especially like the fact it has 8GB of RAM and the 3GM graphics card.  Windows screams on this!", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "I'm in love..", "Author": "Darlene", "ReviewID": "RHTSIZMIAHHLL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay, this machine is amazing... although I've been tethered to a desktop for 6 years, except for occasionally borrowing my daughter's laptop when I traveled.  I haven't traveled with it yet (just got it) so not sure how I'm going to handle the weight, but so far, it doesn't seem too uncomfortable to move around with despite it being a 17\".I love how it has a \"bump\" towards the back.  Not only does it allow you to grab it easier when closed, like to pull it out of your bag, but it also elevates the machine to a comfy typing position and allows air circulation for extra cooling.  It runs prety quiet too, something I worried about, and I am running some pretty graphic intense software on it with no issues, no heating (though I do use a cooling pad), no lag, and no jet engine fan noise.  The keyboard has a nice comfortable size, a plus for me, and a full number pad too.  And  it's not loaded with crapware either--unless you count McAfee, something you can't even opt-out of at the Dell Store, but I easily got rid of it.As for the specs, if you know specs, you know what you are getting.  I did price something similar at Dell, but since at Dell they are custom building, it was way pricier!  Also being custom built I wound up being distracted by shiny things I wanted to add that I really didn't need, driving the price up even higher.  On top of that I would have had to wait a few more weeks before they shipped it, as opposed to getting something already put together and shipped immediately (seller was amazing too, I had my machine in just a few days).  This was way convenient, had exactly what I was looking for/needed and I didn't have to wait.all in all, great...fantastic", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing Laptop!", "Author": "Laurel B", "ReviewID": "RJJUCW5IF8FS2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this with trepidation because I read more than a few reports of problems right out of the box. Not for me.. fortunately. I am upgrading from a Dell XPS 1730 with 2 nvidea SLI graphics cards. In MHO.. the SLI thing was not successful.. many games could not detect it.. and the machine ran very hot, all the time. This machine is a total wowser.. there are low end graphics on the motherboard that are fine for word processing, etc.  but the 3G Nvidia card is fabulous! I am playing SkyRim with everything set to very high. The framerate is great.. the screen and graphics are so spectacular that I often stop and spend a long time just admiring the view in the game! The raised lip on the battery keeps everything cool..the system  does blow some heat when really working but the fan is quiet. The speakers are nice, the Blue Ray drive runs quiet ( my old one sounded like it was trying to give birth!) The windows rating for this is only 5.9.. I think 7200 rpm drives are slow.. but only in comparison to everything else.. the other scores were between 6.9 and 7.6. The battery life is also awesome. I got 5 hours just playing games and watching CD's. Impressive. I wish I had got the model with the backlit keyboard and the 3d glasses ( I am sending away for the 3d stuff, can't do anything about the keyboard tho)..Other than that I could not be happier with this purchase.  PS..If you purchase one of these,  go on the Dell support page and run the graphics diagnostics on  this rig.. it will blow you away.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "could've been great - things keeping getting worse", "Author": "Alex \"average joe\"", "ReviewID": "R3SFHPFROLZLIM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My old Dell 8600 was on it's way out so I was looking for the next machine to replace it.  I keep my computer for a long time, so I wanted to get the best I could get.  I also didn't plan on carrying it around, so I wanted a large screen size.  This machine looked like it fit the bill.  First, the machine started out really well.  It is fast.  The hi res panel is pretty nice.  The video card is pretty good too.  My initial impressions were all good.Once I started using it I noticed a major problem with the touch pad.  The touch pad placement is wrong.  The touch pad is offset about a half inch to the right.  that means that your right palm will hit the touch pad when you type.  That will cause the cursor to jump around.  It is very frustrating and one has to wonder who the genius was who though that was a good idea.  The touch pad should be centered on the letter B not the letter N.That was the first negative.  Unfortunately it was not the last.  This is a high end machine and I had high expectations.  After 13 months the battery died.  My prior Dell's battery lasted much longer time.  It lasted more than 3 years before I had to replace it.  The other annoying problem is that right around the same time the battery died, the power plug no longer would stay connected to the back of the computer.  So besides the battery dieing now it is difficult to charge the battery.Overall this is a powerful computer that let me down because of the poor design of the touchpad and the power system.  They cut corners on the battery and the power plug system.  When you consider the cost, that is inexcusable.  In the past I would only buy Dell computers.  Now I am rethinking that.  My next computer will probably be a different brand.  I've heard good things about Sony's.6/2013 Update***I just dropped the rating from 3 stars to 1 star.  Why the change?  Because I have had two more issues with the computer.  Both are due to poor design.  The first new issue has to do with the power supply.  For some stupid reason Dell thought it would be a good idea to not charge the battery if the computer does not recognize the power supply that is plugged in.  You can still use the computer, but the battery will not be charged.  The was it identifies the powersupply is by the tiny wire that sticks out of the middle of the power supply plug.  If that gets broken off or if the internal wire connection goes bad, you get no charging.  Google dell power supply problem and you can read all about this STUPID design.  Luckily the fix is pretty easy, just get a new power supply.  I found a used one on ebay at a reasonable cost.  So I can once again charge my battery.The next problem is the headphone jack went bad.  You would think, hey this machine has two jacks so I can just use the second.  Unfortunately this very common failure mode is not that the jack stops working when you plug in a headphone.  Instead the failure is that the computer thinks you always have headphones plugged in and the built in speakers no longer produce sound.  Again, this is a common failure due to bad design.  This is really inexcusable for a high end machine.  I'm done with buying Dell computers.", "Date": "February 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Buy", "Author": "Joel", "ReviewID": "R349QIQODAYAZV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The laptop arrived in just a few days with no problems. Initially, I was a bit confused by the specs as there were two different specs being advertised in the technical details and the product features at Amazon. However,when I got the laptop its specs matched exactly with what was stated on the captioned title.If you are thinking about buying you should now that keypad does not have the scroll feature, screen  does not support 3D and the keyboard is not backlit making it difficult to see in a dim room. The speakers sounds excellent and performance superb. Overall, I would give this a thumbs up for the price and all the other goodies that comes with this laptop.", "Date": "December 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Product for Gamers", "Author": "ricardovargas", "ReviewID": "R3EOH6T2F9I4ON", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is great, all works fine and its an excelent purchase...The only thing is that optimus characteristic of nvidia, is not 100% right with some games but i think it will be fix soon...", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Prompt service", "Author": "Stan", "ReviewID": "R3J4XY6LVHHQGF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Prompt service.

I will have to say that is a remarkable laptop, but overheating is huge issue with this laptop. This laptop is without question a desktop replacement as a cooling pad is required if you plan on doing any type of gaming/processor heavy work. The laptop itself is a very well built and has survived being thrown around in my backpack (With a case of course.)  And is still chugging away happily despite having chipped off plastic on the back of my laptop. The XPS 17  has also survived two cases where I accidentally poured a little water onto the keyboard, and was solved quickly after I bathed my laptop in dry rice to absorb the liquid. That being said it's great laptop.However its parts are not so great. The laptop is programmed to refuse any non-dell products. So if you want to replace something and your laptop is no longer under warranty. Despite there being a third-party product with the exact same specifications the XPS 17 will not allow for it. This is true for both the laptop battery, (which will no longer hold a charger after approximately six months) and the Charging cord.So ultimately, good laptop overall. But has overheating problems and when it comes time to repair the laptop it will be pricier than you will expect.", "Date": "November 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "The blu-ray BD disk combo was not included in product as stated in description, continuous technical problems and complications", "Author": "John K Farley", "ReviewID": "R31Q9P6BLNOQWR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Since the Blu-ray combo was not included, I had purchase a Blu-ray disc drive, the software, and installation after I received the computer.
