Most of you may not understand what I'm saying about the design if you have not touch the Hp spectre xt yet( it's a world design class,you will fell in love with if you ever have it)'Ok guy let go back to the HP ENVY 17----------- great performance,great avery battery life compare to traditional pc with cyberlink- blu ray  for video.Doesn't make noise. All I'm trying to say it that this is the great computer you can find on the market and has no regret for years to come. Only the new technology and innovations can make me replace this piece of art.
