{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A great gaming laptop for the price", "Author": "Joseph M. Simmons", "ReviewID": "R1ZNX5HNYMJ4TZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered the G75VW-DH72 just a few days ago, expecting it to be a powerful gaming laptop, but a little unsure of it, because it came with Windows 8. Received it today, and after a little poking around and installation of a few games, I have come to the following conclusion: This laptop rocks!Guild Wars 2, with graphics set to Ultra, runs smooth as a baby's bottom. Not choppy at all, zero graphics lag, just absolutely beautiful! Rift, again with the graphics cranked all the way up, shows zero issues at all, even in crowded areas. I am currently in the process of installing The Secret World (my most graphically intensive game), but after Rift ran so well, I anticipate no issues will arise with TSW.But besides gaming purposes, how does the machine handle overall? Like a champ, actually. I wanted to know how fast it started up, assuming this would be quick due to the SSD, and my friends and I guessed it would be about 30 seconds from totally off to logged on and ready to go. I've had previous laptops with an SSD primary drive, and 20-30 seemed reasonable based on that experience.We were wrong: Eight seconds. 8. Ocho. VIII.That, my friends, is a fast boot.So, is the Asus G75VW-DH72 worth the money? For me, on the limited experience I have with it thus far, I would say absolutely yes it is. The only regret I have is that it does not come with a Recovery disk, nor does there appear to be a way to create one yourself, which is annoying. Luckily, you can create one via Windows 8, and now I have a nice backup on a thumbdrive, in case the worst case scenario ever happens.Update - I've been using this laptop daily for the last couple of months, and it is still rock-solid. All of my games load ridiculously fast, it works great for creating and editing my podcast, and I have yet to have a single issue. I have worked the poor thing to death, put it under strain other \"gaming\" laptops would have buckled under, and the Asus took it all in stride.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good product, stand up service from Asus.", "Author": "Joshua", "ReviewID": "R1YNCKGKI4IBYX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop to replace a HP Pavilion DV9700t (which lasted about two years before the plastic screen casing split, charging port was worn out, and one of the hinges failed!).  The first thing I noticed about this Asus laptop was how heavy and sturdy it was.  It does have boot times in the single digits; rendering the instant on feature practically useless.  Windows 8 is taking some getting used to.  Luckily there is an option to revert to a standard desktop screen.  The first time I used this laptop for an extended period it overheated and shut down.  As it turns out the fan nearest the charging port wasn't working.  I paid shipping back to Asus but they quickly repaired and returned it to me.  I've owned it about a month now and haven't found any other quirks.  Overall I'm very happy with this purchase and hope it lasts a long time.", "Date": "March 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not quite perfect", "Author": "Scott  Brooks", "ReviewID": "R1A9YM96H71SFT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Review of Asus G85VW Gaming LaptopIt's big for a laptop but it's a gaming machine for serious gamers, and very powerful.  It seems to have good design as far as laptops go, I've only owned 3. The keyboard is just basic as far as laptops go but it has a variable LED lighting option for dim light conditions. There is good separation of the keys. It comes with the software for a Asus gaming mouse. It comes with 3d software if you get the Asus 3D glasses. You can check out the other options on the website overview.The cooling system is intelligently designed for a laptop, twin fans suck air from under the case over the critical components and exit at the back exhaust. The fans are near the back to minimum noise. The fans have a pair of metal grilled disk filters that are lose over the intake ports to cut the dust intake down. They could help but still the fine dust could get through. Only a porous foam overlay could filter out the fine stuff.One filter is easy to reach by removing a small panel. but the other requires you remove a large access panel that is easy to remove but hard to put back due to the snap design. Asus should have designed small retaining screws instead of the snap design.My version came with a 256GB SSD Lite-On drive that is very quick.The LCD display is just as good as any but you can always connect to a larger display through either the VGA standard connect port or the HDMI interface. I think these laptop vendors would have gotten smarter and allowed the LDC screen to be removable so that one could conveniently upgrade to a larger external screen. As it is now, one could get a wireless keyboard and mouse to have virtually the same conveniences as a traditional desktop computer system. As it is now desktops appear to be disappearing and the only ones remaining would be the more professional workstation types they use exotic power processors like the Intel Xeon CPUs.One big problem I have with Asus, they no longer have configuration options on their website. You have to go through retail vendors to get a preconfigured one, no options on hardware or OS. And their customer service seems to have degraded as have other vendors. For instance, I created an account on their ROG site several years ago. Since that time I changed Internet providers and thus email service, but when I tried to upgrade my ROG account it failed to do so. I left an email message explaining my problem to the webmaster and still the problem never got corrected. Well that means this will be my last computer system from Asus, motherboards included.The system came with Windows 8 with their horrible metro system made for the smaller mobile devices. I'm still learning about it. Since Vista Microsoft has come up with cruddier user icons and interfaces from Windows-XP when you could configure anything on the desktop system interface. But there are ways and aftermarkets software utilities to get some semblance of the old XP-Interface. Still it sucks to me. Go to howtogeek.com to find out more.But there are some features that are desirable with Windows 8 past the ugly metro interface. Boot Speed- Windows 8 uses some tricks to dramatically improve its boot speed. Improved Multiple Monitor Support- For power uses with multiple monitors, windows 8 allows you to place separate taskbars and wallpapers on each monitor. Previously, this required third-party software. Task Manager- The new Task Manager is a huge improvement over the old one. Storage Spaces- Storage Spaces is a power-user feature that allows you to combine multiple physical volumes into one logical volume. Hyper V- Windows 8\u2019s included Hyper-V feature allows you to create virtual machines out-of-the-box. Battery Life- Low-level system changes, including optimizations to squeeze more battery life out of tablets and other portable computers. Security- Secure Boot provides protection from rootkits that hijack the startup process, assuming you\u2019re using a new PC with UEFI instead of the traditional BIOS; SmartScreen filter at a lower level helps prevent less experienced uses from downloading and installing malware, and low-level changes to memory allocation and Address Space Layout Randomization that make security vulnerabilities harder to exploit, even if security holes are found. UEFI - This replaces the old BIOS process and allows 32-bit and 64-bit modes, allowing much more RAM to be addressed by more complex processes, allows booting from hard disks as large as 9.4 ZB, allows more boot options, doesn\u2019t prescribe particular file systems, UEFI can offer better boot times and loading, and has excellent network booting abilities. But the bummer is you need a newer motherboard and other systems to support all the advantages of Windows 8, especially the newer UEFI BIOS replacement, Older BIOS based motherboards won't support it effectively. So what you will see is a interface called the EFI -Bios Utility for some system configurations.Well that's the gist of the good, bad and ugly of it.", "Date": "April 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beyond Expectations", "Author": "Bogie", "ReviewID": "R3H5751EJ26E8X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I do not normally provide feedback, but this was necessary.

There was not a manual/quick guide/Helpful hints/Warning dealing with the new operating system. Windows 8 is very confusing and not really necessary for a non-touch screen laptop. I also only come from an extended background of XP and a brief Win 7 encounter in the last few months. With that being said I would have liked hard copies of Win 8, and Asus drives in case I wanted/needed to reformat.- I was not prepared for a split hard drive; took me a couple days to realize that I was saving everything to OS drive when I finally filled it. I had to spend hours moving programs and files around to other drives. I quickly have gotten used to it.- I noticed, although its hardly taking up room, a partition which has old files that cannot be deleted or accessed.- Took longer than expected to ship to my house.Things I am pleased with:- Computer's specs- Literally \"like new\" appearance - no blemishes (refurbished)- Overall performance of video and sound- Battery life 5ish hoursPerhaps I have just never experienced a decent gaming computer before... but it makes me giddy.", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Had it for one day", "Author": "John Tran", "ReviewID": "R2TV5HKLT93IKS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If you like big laptop with big screen, this is your kind. My laptop was defective so I had to return it. It overheated within 15 mins to the point where I couldn't touch under it. And all I did was install chrome and set up my account. I gotta give one more star cause Adorama did an excellent job in helping me return my product, unlike other companies that deduct price from you for repackaging fee. I honestly would buy another one but I just don't want to risk getting another defect.The screen is crystal clear, Load up in 2 seconds but you have to log in since its window 8, so thats another 5 seconds. the quality built was smooth.

It took 8-9 seconds to start up.Windows 8 is still kinda funky, but no complains, at least it still got the classic Windows 7 option, and I notice that 8 boost up thelaptop a bit.Video games, haven't tried a lot, but I edit video and animation on it, it's pretty fast, save lots of rendering time.Keyboard setup, I like it.Fans are really soft, even when I render, it doesn't kick in like a lawn mower, like my other laptops I had.The SSD and the HDD are both partitioned into 4 separate partition. If you don't like it, go and download \"EaseUS Partition Master 9.2.2\" or any of the late version, the free edition have the merging option to merge the partition back to just two partition total, I did, 4 partition is too much for me.Pretty heavy, but not that heavy, make sense due to the specs it has.Overall view, I really like this so far, and for a furnished laptop, it was like brand new and everything seems to work like brand new.
