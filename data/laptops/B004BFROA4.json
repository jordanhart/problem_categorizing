I've reinstalled the crappy Dell factory home OS with a regular Win 7 Pro and it's seems to do slightly better.  This laptop overheats, freezes and is cheaply made.  The optical drive is also very cheap and really noisy.  I have to say, I am very disappointed in the quality of Dell's work here.  The studio series has a very well documented problem with overheating, but Dell doesn't seem to care.  When you call for warranty fixes they send someone out to swap out the motherboard and usually some other random hardware like the processor and heat-sink. However, this does nothing as the poorly designed case and airflow issue still exists.  They may also reflash your BIOS with the newest version to help fine tune the fan control, but again, this does nothing as fan is the proverbial tree in the way of a flood river.  It may slow some of the rushing water down for a second but will ultimately fail to do anything to prevent the flood.On a related note, I also have a dual boot install of Ubuntu on this thing and that too freezes from overheating.  I've run every Dell diagnostic, etc and everything seems to checkout.  It basically just comes down to the fact that this laptop is poorly designed with cheaply made parts and should be recalled and replaced with something better.  I personally will never buy another Dell for the rest of my life based solely on how bad my experience with this laptop has been.  I'll stick with building my own computers from now on I think.  There's nothing better than working away on the laptop to then have it randomly and blue screen on you.  And from what I read, I don't get the overheating blue screens nearly as often as some people.*UPDATE - It seems that Dell pretty much stopped supporting this system right out of the gate.  The last update to any of the drivers was in 2010 for the most part.  Video drivers are awful and even though the hardware manufacture has released many newer version of the drivers, I cannot install them.  Dell would need to tune those newer drivers to fit their hardware otherwise the installation fails.  And of course, they haven't.  Stay clear of anything Dell.  They want a premium for their products only to stop supporting you once you've purchased in to the \"dude you're gettin' a Dell\".  There are so many alternatives out there that there is no reason to get a Dell.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Never buy Dell.", "Author": "Kyle", "ReviewID": "RQK8NSX7UF9HJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I fixed my girlfriend's Studio 1558 and I saw many flaws in its design. Had to replace the heatsink & fan because that had failed, and she only had it a year. Its average temperature was 100C before I fixed it. There was a small gap between the GPU and the heatsink, and due to this, the GPU was not being cooled and averaged around 80C. I fixed this by installing a copper shim in this gap. I can promise with how much bad experience has been had with these laptops that it is not a coincidence. I'm sure they all had this same gap! It is disappointing to find such a silly mistake from a manufacturer. Never buy Dell laptops! They charge far too much for their shoddy build quality.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Overheats", "Author": "me", "ReviewID": "R3CLPAYD1YQ5S7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When will I learn my lesson to stop buying Dell and HP laptops!?  Within 1 week of the warranty expiring, this laptop (like all Dell and HP laptops seem to do eventually) starts overheating for no apparent reason (while web browser, in Word, etc) and just shuts down--screen instantly goes black.  The expensive IBM/Lenovo brands they have at my work are apparently worth it, since they don't seem to have this problem.

It has a very big screen, which is definitely a plus.However, the manufacturing on this computer is terrible. It has many plastic pieces that repeatedly break, mostly notable the ac adapter plugin and the power button on the sides. The power button is a huge issue because the wires that control it are on the lid moving thing, so sooner or later they inevitably break and of course it is your fault.If you intend to use this as a desktop that is fine, but if you want it as a laptop you need to care for it as you would an infant.
