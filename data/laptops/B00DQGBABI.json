However if you spend some extra money, it will become a great performing notebook.I added 4GB of memory ($40).The installed wireless mini-card is below average, I only got 72Mbps. I bought the Intel AC7260 card (~$35) and now I have BOTH Bluetooth and wireless AC which runs at 866.7Mbps.The HDD w small SSD will give you very fast boot time but you will see occasionally jerkiness when bringing up new apps. I recommend replacing the HDD with a 240GB SSD (~$150).The screen is adequate (768p) for MS office and IE11 but if you want use win8.1 touch to run multi screen apps it will be a little cramped. The touchscreen is very good and responds spot on with my hand.If you want to do any upgrading, please make sure you watch the youtube video on how to open this laptop and upgrade any parts; it is quite easy to do.Now I have an ultrabook which rivals any $1200 4th-gen ultrabooks out there except screen resolution.This notebook is shipped with Win8; so when you boot up, you will probably have a few dozen windows updates to download and install; this may take an hour. After all that is done, look for Win8.1 in the app store; another hour of download and install.", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Honest Review without any Bias", "Author": "Timothy", "ReviewID": "R2PKXYBJSWXSC9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This laptop will end up on the books as a solid four-star ultrabook unless various \"picky\" reviewers show up and start downgrading the notebook below that, which can happen. However, as a fairly proficient PC user and one that has never been a \"gamer\" and thus I have never needed the high-end money laptops I have always searched for an affordable, fast, and stylish laptop that would see be pushing strong after 2 years of solid productivity use. This laptop is an absolute BARGAIN (I got it at 479.00). Anyone that thinks they could get anything with this package for less or the same is not being truthful. I spend hours researched, watching youtube reviews, and etc. I already knew ahead of time based upon reviews what to expect (pro and con) thus I wasn't upset or surprised.PROS:Very Thin and Stylish3rd Generation i5 processor (never go with Celeron or AMD chips, stick with i3-i7. I chose i5 because my other laptop which my wife is getting is a solid i3 so I needed an upgrade)Hybrid SSD Hard Drive (this isn't a full out SSD drive which reflects in the cost. You could easily purchase a full SSD for around 150 but it isn't necessary. This drive does what you need it to do in efficiency and speed. Anyone going from HDD standalone to this will think they are in heaven)Screen Size: Love the 14 inch screen. This is of course what adds a bit more weight to this than other ultrabooks...however I am amused when I see people acting like 4lb total weight is like lugging around a desktop computer)Black Aluminum Top: I don't find it to be a \"fingerprint magnet\" as many have described. I expected huge greasy smudges after touching it. Yes fingerprints show but not in the greasy way you envision. I don't find this a big deal at all.Touchscreen: Takes a little getting used to at first. Found the screen to be very solid and doesn't really shake when using the touchscreen features. Reflection and glare isn't an issue to me because I typically don't type and work on a laptop out in the park under a blazing sun. This shows fingerprints more than the cover but any touchscreen you use will do that.Fan Noise: Absolutely ZERO. This is one of the quietest laptops I have ever owned.Heat: Like any laptop it will give off heat but I don't find it giving off a ton of heat at all like others I have owned. I always use an aluminum cooler for laptops.Windows 8: Ok I know that I am listing this under \"pros\" but it isn't really a con or a pro for me. I personally like Windows 7 better but you can immediately install \"START8\" which gives you the desktop you typically would use in windows 7 or Ultra. I don't need all the extra apps and fluff that Windows 8 uses. However, you get two start menus basically side by side when using \"Start 8.\" One is the APPS screen which you use your touchscreen for and the other is the classic start menu. However...immediately upgrade to the 8.1 version of Windows 8. I found that it fixed a few software kinks I was having.MEMORY: The 4GB memory was fine but I went ahead and ordered 4 GB more (Corsair Vengeance 4GB DDR3 1600mhz (PC3 12800) for around 35 dollars. Very easy to install. Search youtube for a video that shows how to install it. BE SURE YOU are grounded on something so you don't get static output from your hands to the internal components. However, it is PLUG and PLAY memory...super easy...now I have 8GB!)CONS:Wireless: Ok...PLAN ON ORDERING A REPLACEMENT INTERNAL ADAPTER. Just trust me. Every review practically states this and most internet searches reveal major issues with Atheros Qualcomm adapters. I ordered the ($33.99) Intel 7260HMW IEEE 802.11AC, dual-band, 2x2 Wi-Fi - OEM from Newegg since it is a little cheaper and actually ships from the company whereas amazon ships from an external company. Trust me...ORDER THIS! It's either that or plan on sending the laptop in to get them to either replace it with another junky Atheros model and wait all that extra time or be prepared ;) )Keyboard: Ok...it isn't a big deal at all and not a true CON. The keyboard is a little more spongy I guess than other keyboards I've used. However, I'm not a hard key banger so I don't have issues. If you are a huge key slammer you may have to get used to the keyboard. Other than that...I type great with it and don't mind it at all.TRACKPAD: This one takes a little getting used to for me. It is much more sensitive than other laptops I use. However...it is manageable. Just not the old drag and scrape pushpad I consider older laptops to have. Very sensitive and so you learn to just easily use your fingers and no problem. The \"click\" parts on the bottom of the track pad (right and left) have a little more \"click\" to them. You will see what I mean when you get the laptop.CONCLUSION:This is only four stars because of the WIFI needs to be replaced which ASUS should take care of. However, I promise you, for the price you cannot find a better laptop with the i5, hybrid SSD, the ability to upgrade to 8gb ram, the style, thinness, touchpad, etc. This is hands down one of the best laptops I have owned in this price range. I would take this any day over many of the other laptops which are higher priced. If anything changes I'll let you know!", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Replaced my Mac with this. Thought I would cry but smiled instead!", "Author": "Beth Spears \"Beth\"", "ReviewID": "RGHCC7PCW3M6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My MacBook is seven years old and on its last leg. I needed something relatively inexpensive and sturdy since I travel a lot. I wanted (needed?) a computer that could compare to my beloved MacBook. Mournfully, I researched EVERY computer within this price range and this computer gives the most bang for the buck. It's light enough. The computer is very sturdy (almost as sturdy as the MacBook Air). When I looked at computers in person, I would try to flex the cover to see how much give it has. This has none which made me feel more confident in buying it. It does, like another reviewer said, show finger prints like mad. I keep my hands clean and lotion-free but it looks like I've been digging in a fried chicken bucket and then palming my computer.Windows 8 isn't as bad as I thought it would be. It takes some getting used to but gives the computer the feel of a tablet. If you use that mindset, you'll be ok. The 8.1 update was supposed to give you the option to have the computer open to the desktop but I haven't figured that out yet. I actually prefer my computer to open to the tiles page rather than the desktop since it makes it look a lot less like my work laptop. It has taken me longer to get used to the touchpad since I'm used to swiping down to scroll down a page and with this you have to swipe up.The only complaint that I have (other than the fried chicken cover), which might not be a big deal to most, is the keyboard is kind of spongy. The keys take a tab bit more effort to hit than what I'm used to. It makes me feel like I'm typing all angry-like.I have been getting about 5+ hours out of the battery but I don't hang out online all the time. If you are surfing or streaming movies, the battery will probably last about 3 hours.

I was personally also looking at the Aspire S3 which was in a similar price range and about 1 lb lighter. I'll list my primary reasons for purchase and how I chose between the two later:My primary criteria for selection with a new laptop:* A 3rd generation i5 or higher/later (and I checked passmark.com on benchmarks repeatedly, debating with myself)* At least 4GB RAM (upgradeable to higher preferred obviously)* Either 13.3\" or 14\" screen-size - to me, this is the sweet-spot for functional and portable* Portability/lightness* Fast boot-up* Minimum of 4.5 hrs battery life (e.g. a flight coast-to-coast in the U.S., not including take-off/landing)* PC - Windows; and despite the concern over Win 8.x, I preferred to get the latest OS just out of longevity* USB 3.0 port(s), HDMI; an RJ45 (preferred, just for wired situations)* Cost: In the $500 range or lower* Something that should hopefully last at least 2 years with reasonable performanceIt was a really tough battle for me to decide between this and the Acer Aspire S3 (391-6811), but here were my deciding factors between this and the S3:- Touchscreen- Upgradeability for RAM (8GB max vs. S3's 4GB max)- Slightly higher price for S3 with similar internal specs (at least when I purchased)The competing S3 was lighter, has a slightly better CPU (i5-3337 vs. i5-3317) and probably a better wi-fi card. I loved the form factor on the S3 too, but am pretty fond of the S400CA's looks too now. Both were upgradeable in terms of changing to a full-on Solid State Drive (SSD)-- but for the value, the S400CA seemed like too good a deal to pass up. Obviously, I'd prefer a true SSD, but the Hybrid SSD (which is present in both models) does work decently well in boot-ups at least in my first week of use.The Cons - everything always has some trade-offs; I personally found these acceptable:- WiFi card isn't the greatest; some other comments have mentioned this. It is replaceable for relatively cheap though.- Resolution: it's pretty much 'standard' resolution, but definitely many premier ultrabooks have way better (again, price is a factor)- You will almost certainly have to do a lot of Windows updates (first on Windows 8.0, and then to 8.1) after purchasing. I am not used to Windows 8.x myself, but am growing to get used to it honestly. I don't think it's as bad as some people say, though my two cents is that I wish it integrated with non-Microsoft stuff better - e.g. Google Calendar (which I use frequently)- At about 4 lbs, it isn't the lightest laptop (though definitely light enough IMHO)- 2 of the 3 USB ports are USB 2.0 for whatever reason (but at least one of them was made into USB 3.0, right?)- Yes, the screen lid and the screen itself does get smudgy. Not a deal killer in my opinion as of yet.Also, may not be relevant for everyone and mileage may vary, but I ordered on a Sunday from Amazon as a Prime member with two-day shipping. This may not happen for everyone, but I was pleasantly surprised when it not only shipped on Sunday, but arrived at my house the next day (Monday). That has got to be one of the most incredible, fastest buy-to-receive times I've ever had without paying for one-day shipping. Thank you, Amazon!If you're trying to get a laptop on budget, to me, this seems like a good deal. If anything bad happens, I'll try to update my review though.

My first one had problems. I dismissed it as a dud giving ASUS the benefit of the doubt. This one has been even worse. Here is what to expect if you buy this laptop. Other users have had the same problems.Problem #1: Mouse Pad. It doesn't work. Two fingers are supposed to scroll down the page. It worked the first day and then worked off and on after that. Now it is completely broken. Also you have to push down on the mouse pad just right to select anything. It's a real pain.Problem #2: Aside from the fact that it doesn't have a back-lit keyboard the keys don't work. I have to pound them to get them to work. Come on, that's ridiculous.Problem #3: This by far the worst problem of all. My computer shuts off randomly. One reviewer described hearing a click right before it shuts down. I have had the same problem. It also makes a funny noise. Since the fan is the only moving part it has been deemed defective. The fan sounds like its going to break all the time. I talked to an IT guy about this and because of the way Ultra books are built the motherboard will most likely need to be replaced along with the fan.Like I said before, these problems are not unique.

The smart gesture stops working after a while. It came back after I reboot it, but it disappears again for no reason. It can be quite annoying after getting used to scrolling down pages using easy two finger gesture, but it does not really matter that much.2. The keyboard does take a little while to get used to, but to be honest,the only issue is the space key. It is so easy to miss spaces using the space key on this laptop.

So far, in only a few days of ownership, I am really impressed with both.  Neither one had any keyboard issues and surprisingly, both seem to have rock solid wifi even at a great distance from the router.  I noticed that the two I received have the Atheros wifi adapter, and I think that maybe some of the earlier units had another lesser known brand wifi adapter (I will update later if it does start dropping signal regularly).  I myself have a Sony Vaio 14\" Ultrabook, and even though these Asus are considerably less expensive, I like them almost as much and don't feel like too much was sacrificed to meet a lower price point.Things that are better about the Asus laptops - the core i5 processor is considerably zippier than my older i3 vaio.  Also, I actually prefer the keyboard on the Asus to that of the Vaio, as the keys don't require as hard a keypress to register - likewise for the trackpad - a light touch is all it takes to register.  I can also touch type on the Asus keyboard easier than I can on the Vaio - I think the keyboard on the Asus is just slightly bigger which makes it easier to touch type on.  Also, the Asus laptops came with significantly less crapware pre-installed and they were kind enough to make most of it optional thru their software installer app.  I wish all pc manufacturers would do this.Things that I like better about my Vaio than these Asus - the screen. While all three have the same resolution screen, the Vaio screen looks better. The Asus screens look fine, just not as good as the more expensive ultrabooks.  Also, the Vaio has  a quieter fan, hard drive, and other internals which makes it obvious that it is a more expensive higher quality laptop.  Not that these are loud by any means, just not absolutely silent like my Vaio is.All-in-all, you really can't go wrong with these Asus ultrabooks if you are looking for a low cost entry into the touchscreen ultrabook arena.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wanted Better", "Author": "Brent Lee", "ReviewID": "R1SBNTOCGWR3WG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I really wanted to like this laptop.

I'm starting programming classes soon and all my computer science major friends told me that having my own laptop is extremely helpful. My dad told me that he bought it for under $450, so I will review it as a $450 laptop.I'll start with the good things, of which there are a lot of.-Aesthetics. The build quality and design of the laptop is beautiful. Seems quite sturdy, but I have yet to drop it (and I don't plan to). Both closed and open, it's a very sexy laptop. Of course, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and this is only my personal opinion on this matter. Results may vary. The display is bright and colorful, and there is not much of a difference in quality when viewing at an odd angle. The aluminum back DOES attract fingerprints, but they wipe off easily with a soft cloth (one should come with the laptop if bought new).-Speed/Performance. The laptop is super quick. You really can't beat the 24 gig solid state drive and i5 processor for the price. It boots almost instantly and is completely ready to go within seconds. Everything I've done on it so far has been speedy, but I haven't started school yet, nor have I started programming with it, so we'll see how that goes. It has 4 gigs of RAM, but you can easily upgrade it to 8 if you so desire. I have not done so yet, but considering how cheap RAM is nowadays, why not?-Windows 8/Touchscreen combo. Believe it or not, I am including this as a good thing. I'm somewhat surprised at how natural it feels to use the touchscreen in combination with the keyboard and touchpad, and WIndows 8 makes it possible. Yes, some of the UI choices Microsoft made with 8 are a bit... frivolous, and I find myself rolling my eyes every once in a while, but it is an OS best suited for a touchscreen PC such as this one, and they wok beautifully in tandem. However, after you learn all the quirks with the OS, you get used to it and it sort of grows on you. If you download 8.1, the desktop functions almost identically with 7. Both the touchscreen and the touchpad are very responsive, and the touchpad is very intuitive, allowing you to click by just tapping or pressing down.-The price. Well, technically I got it for free. So.. yeah. But still an amazing value.Now, the bad. Before I begin, let me state that the good aspects of this computer far outweigh the bad, especially for the price.-The keyboard. This is definitely my biggest complaint with the laptop. It feels very.. mushy, is the best word for it. I think I saw some other reviews use this exact word and it is very accurate. There is very little haptic feedback and it is easy to press a key and \"miss\" it, so to speak. I am typing this review on the laptop and I just missed the O in laptop and the T in typing. Perhaps it just takes some readjustments in typing habits (AKA I have to learn to type with more than my two index fingers and my thumb), but for now, it's a bit irritating. It is also not backlit, which some might find to be annoying. I personally don't care, but I thought it might be useful to note for some people.That's all I have to say about that. I can't comment on the battery life because I haven't unplugged it for any extended period of time yet, but I'm assuming that it will not be much of an issue even if it is short, as almost every single building I will go to has outlets.Overall, very, very good laptop for the price. If you can get it for under $500, go for it. I'm sure there are some things I missed in my review, but I hope that you found it helpful.

I have to press it really hard in the center of the spacebar for it to properly work. Pressing the spacebar's edges will not work at all. Also, the keyboardfeels very \"squishy\". Pressing a little bit harder than usual in the center will cause the keyboard to cave in a bit. But the Chiclet design and the spacing between the keys are good.- Battery life isn't the greatest- screen is not very bright even at highest- At 1.7 ghz, it will not run your favorite games without lag spikes (Skyrim, Borderlands, Battle Field 4, etc.)- wifi is not the best, will upgrade it soonOverall, this is a great laptop for the price of around $550.

The computer arrived fine and as I was told it came with Windows 8.  One month after I got it, I did the upgrade to windows 8.1.  After two months the computer did not allow me to shut down.  Every time I wanted to shut down the PC I got a blue screen and an error message.  The only way to shut down the computer was to \u201csuspend it\u201d.  During the past 4 months the problems have been increasing.  After a while none of the programs of Microsoft Office would not work.  Every time I tried to open one program of the office package the computer would try to validate the software with Microsoft.  The ASUS computer was so unstable that every software package felt they were in different computers every time I started a given program.With all these problems I called the Technical Service of ASUS.  I called the technical Service of Asus in Spain because I moved to Spain.  They asked to send them the Serial Number, the Guarantee and the invoice, which I did.  I sent al the requested documents and after two weeks of going back and forth they told me that they will not fix my computer because the invoice of Amazon US did not have my Tax or ID number on it. I tried to explain to them that Amazon US makes the invoices that way but no luck!!What a disaster of Service!!  I cannot recommend to anyone that they purchase any equipment from ASUS.  If you have a problems, you are in your own, no help from the manufacturer. NO HELP AT ALL.We also had a problem with an ASUS tablet ASUS VivoTab Smart ME400C-C1-BK.  The tablet once a week would all of a sudden go to a blue screen and you would lose everything and have to start all over again.  We called the technical people at ASUS in Spain and they again, did not want to take care of the tablet.  They told us in addition that it was our fault because we upgraded from windows 8 to windows 8.1, and we were supposed to use always the original software from the manufacturer.

It doesn't have the 'rickety' hinge for the LCD screen where it seems like it's going to snap in have if you open it too quick (I experienced this on some cheaper dells).3) Pretty good specs, but can be better (See other Cons & thoughts).Cons:1) The WIFI network card that comes with the laptop is absolutely terrible. I never encountered any sort of modern device (Phone/laptop) that took longer than a 56k Modem to load a webpage (Not joking...).

Go to this website and choose the appropriate (and most recent) OS and adapter: [...]You will be told you need to download Asus installer. After doing that, the adapter downloads automatically.

Kelvington", "ReviewID": "R2J7EQ8LW4LSIB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop looking for a replacement to my compact Lenovo X220 laptop. I wanted something solid (not cheap feeling plastic) with a nice touch pad that I could travel with easily. This laptop looked good, so I thought I'd try it out. I'll start with what I didn't like:As soon as I turned it on I regretted my purchase. The screen on this laptop is worse then bad. It boggles the mind to think that someone would approve a screen this bad looking for a product. It's bright, has nice color representation, and has great viewing angles, but the 1366x768 resolution is far, FAR too low for a 14 inch screen. When holding it at arm's length or using it on my lap I could see individual pixels! That's not an exaggeration. It was like looking at a 1080p TV from a distance of six inches. Small fonts were very difficult to read, and large fonts had jagged edges. It's the same resolution as my old Lenovo, but it's astonishing how much worse it looks on this laptop. I've never had this problem with any computer I've used before. First I thought there was a plastic protector sheet on the screen that I'd missed, or that it must be something Windows 8 does to render fonts differently and it must be misconfigured. Nope, the screen is actually that bad. I checked the display configuration hoping that it was somehow set to 640x480, but no, it was at the screen's native resolution. I ran the Windows ClearType tool and it didn't change a thing. It's not just fonts that looked bad; everything appeared grainy. The display looked so bad that I immediately knew I wouldn't be able to use this laptop.The touch pad was also not what I had hoped. It looks nice, but after using it for a couple of hours it left me with the feeling that corners were cut while building it. Physically \"clicking\" requires far too much force and it only works along the very bottom edge of the touch pad. The clicking action is also not that great; when clicking, the bottom of the pad lurches into the laptop case with a horrible (and surprisingly loud!) sound. It does this every single time you click and didn't \"break in.\" The ASUS software to configure the touch pad is, as expected, bad. The multi-touch touch pad gestures worked most of the time, but not all. Overall the touch pad seemed to be a shoddy copy of an Apple laptop touch pad that wasn't nearly as usable and clearly made on a tight budget.This laptop did have a few nice features. The solid aluminum case is very solid and had quality construction. It left me with the impression that this laptop would survive a fall off a table with ease. Even the ethernet port, built into the side and hinged to expand to fit an RJ45 plug, felt like a quality part. Hardware spec-wise, the hybrid SSD/HDD and i5 processor are both very nice, and I had no performance issues. More RAM would be a good addition, but the included 4GB is enough to make it usable. The included Windows 8 OS is a huge disappointment, but I don't want to focus on that and I don't hold it against the laptop. The touch screen is very functional and responsive but ultimately totally useless. It's a novelty to use a laptop with your fingers like it's a tablet, but after only a few minutes it became an arm-sore and made me think, \"this is the worst way to hold an iPad.\" It's disappointing that laptop manufacturers are strong-armed by Microsoft into including useless touch screens on laptops, but again, I don't hold it against this laptop and it's not a factor of my review score.Overall, I'd recommend not buying this laptop.

Asus told me it is backed up on a hidden patrician on the hard drive in the event of a failure.  I explained that is nice but if the hard drive has crashed or is inoperable, you cannot restore this system.  Asus stated you would need to send it in for repair in that event.

Afterwards I installed all necessary drivers (gestures, touchpad, graphics, etc..). The bloatware is bad but not terribly bad (see Dell, HP, etc..). After a fresh install the ram when from 50% used during idle to 25% used (on 4GB ram which I suppose is a good improvement). I love the aluminum design and think that for the money the laptop is decent.However... the touchpad and keyboard on my unit are absolutely HORRIBLE. The right-click button sometimes does not work or mistakes the click as a left click. I have installed the latest drivers and the problem persists. I am convinced this is a hardware issue. The keyboard OFTEN misses key-strokes. Again, I am fairly certain that this is a hardware issue as I can \"feel\" that the key does not press all the way day when it does miss-fire. Usually this occurs most often on keys in the middle of the keyboard - I suspect that the lack of rigidity in the middle requires much harder pressing to get the sensor to register a stroke. You can see the aluminum chassis deflects more in the middle (shame... some internal spacers would have easily resolved this). Conclusion: THIS KEYBOARD IS VERY ANNOYING IF YOU OFTEN DO WORD PROCESSING OR WRITE EMAILS!! i.e. 90% of what laptops are used for. I understand this is a budget laptop, but a functioning keyboard should be #1 concern for a designer and touchpad #2. This is how the user interfaces w the product...Overall I am somewhat annoyed.
