Some lower end 15z models don't have a touchscreen or a i7 processor or nVidia GeForce GT630M dedicated graphics. Which allows this laptop to be an entry level gaming machine.

They were happy to replace the hard drive, but even more happy to inform me that I had to pay additional money to recover any data stored on their hard drive that failed after 3 months.
