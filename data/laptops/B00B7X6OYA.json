{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great laptop for the money", "Author": "Warp Spedo", "ReviewID": "R17TTA3ENLX8RS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is probably the best bang for your buck out there right now. I purchased this laptop because I needed a portable computer to take with me to classes for notes so I figured almost anything would do, which lead me to the lower end of the price scale. The first thing I noticed is how beautiful the screen is. The color depth is spot on and everything looks sharp. Performance wise this guy has a dual core, hyper threading Intel i5 with 8 GB of ram, I have yet to see it lag at all. Other features include Bluetooth technology and a 750 GB hard drive separated in to 2 partitions which allows the OS to be recovered without removing data on the 2nd partition.The only drawback to this laptop for most is that it comes with Windows 8 on it which most people aren't liking quite yet. However with a start menu replacement program that allows booting straight in to the desktop I think that Windows 8 becomes acceptable at the least.", "Date": "March 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solid purchase for Computer Science major", "Author": "Mark Engstrom", "ReviewID": "RKNDMIRMQ6BJA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop going into my junior year of college as a Computer Science major. I was looking for something that could handle a variety of tasks such as some gaming (Minecraft and League Of Legends), programming, and entertainment (streaming movies/music). I have been using the laptop and am very pleased with my purchase with 2 minor exceptions.The first thing I am unhappy with is the location of the speakers. I don't use my speakers for more than some music and movies, but the speakers on this laptop are on the bottom of the unit so that the sound is fairly muted. This is a bigger problem when using the laptop on something like a bed than it is if the laptop is on a hard surface. Turning the volume up a few notches can help solve the problem, but it is a little frustruating at first.The second thing I an unhappy with is the location of the USB drives. All 3 USB drives are directly next to each other on the left side of the laptop. This really isn't a huge deal, but I was using a wired mouse at the time and it was messy running a cord from the left USB around the back to use a mouse. I just bought an inexpensive wireless mouse so this should no longer be a problem.Both of these problems are small details and can be averted by simply using the laptop on a hard surface, turning up the volume a bit, or using a wireless mouse. The i5 processor and 5400 rpm hard drive help the laptop continue to run fast even when handling heavier loads while the 17.3 inch screen allows me to have multiple programs open on the screen at the same time. I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a fast 17 inch laptop.", "Date": "August 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice laptop.", "Author": "Amanda", "ReviewID": "R3U8O6KLLVE8DR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This laptop is really great.  The only things I would like improved are:1.  To have USB ports on both sides.  It has 3 USB ports and they are all located on the left of the keyboard.2.  I wish the left click part of the mouse were a little longer than the right click side.  I often hit the right when I intend on hitting the left click.3.  It would be nice if the numlock key and the capslock key would light up when activated.4.  The speaker is not very loud at all.Other than these small things, it works great and I love it!  It is fast and the screen is big and has great color and resolution.", "Date": "August 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "The ASUS X75A-DS51", "Author": "Mo", "ReviewID": "R3KH1Z8QDY7LH7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned multiple laptops and so far, this one is in my top 3 especially at this price range.  I did a lot of research before purchasing and for what you get out of the box and compared to others is excellent.  Nice bright display with good color depth.  Performance wise it has a dual core, hyper threading Intel i5 with 8 GB of Ram.  Compared to some other brands, you're going to pay a little more. The audio sounds goods, but I prefer headphones probably like most.  The battery life could be a little better lasting in the 4-5 hour range with use. Now the biggest reason for the 4 rating is the 10key is a little awkward in it's placement there needs to be a little bit of a gap from the main keyboard, the touchpad takes some getting use too, there is a little more of the bloatware on it then probably some (I just uninstall it) and of course it's Windows 8 which is down right awful.", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "laptop just what i needed", "Author": "T.

I had an hp laptop before but it was such a piece of crap, it eventually burned itself out after only 2.5 years, so getting a tough computer that would last a lot longer was what I was striving for and I got it with this laptop. As far as the review saying the disc drive runs constantly, they must have gotten a bad apple because it really doesn't. This computer is super quiet, and never gets hot. I don't do any hardcore gaming or anything though. I use it to watch movies on my tv via an HDMI cord, which works awesome, and for work so all of the storage really helps. I like that you can turn off the computer screen while connected to the tv so you can focus on the tv. It looks a lot sleeker in person than in the picture. The screen quality is great, it comes with a warranty from Asus, windows 8 is annoying but I always use the desktop app. Quirks- I do hear the disc drive engage randomly but it sounds like one spin, its not noisy or constant just a little zip and its gone. Also, the keyboard took me some getting use to but I think thats a personal thing. Lastly, the mouse pad is sensitive and hard to control but I have always used a little mouse with my computers so it doesn't bother me at all.", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Computer", "Author": "Josh", "ReviewID": "RRIDY403ROHET", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A very high quality computer. I have had no problems (aside from my dislike of windows 8) and have found it smooth performing, quiet, and it runs at an amazingly cool temp.

Personally I have no issues using Windows 8.My major issue is/was that the dvd drive keeps randomly spinning. I had never placed a disk in the drive. When a computer is first starting up I can understand the drive activating for a moment, but this drive kept suddenly spinning at weird times, like while using Facebook. I verified by virus protection was not scanning the drive, and shut down any background programs that would potentially trigger such an action. Despite doing all of the above, the action persisted. At first I thought it was just a fluke, and exchanged the laptop, but the new one did the exact same thing. So I have just returned it, and am back on the hunt for a computer.A dvd drive spinning may not be a big deal, but this drive is loud. It made it hard to hear sound from the computer, like when watching a video. Plus every time it happened the entire computer would stop for a minute. I found it extremely annoying.Another small quirk was the amount of Asus bloatware on the machine. I realize all computers come with some, but there seemed to be more than usual present.", "Date": "May 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Value", "Author": "Precise Appraisal Management", "ReviewID": "R22N1N5KC8N1FO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This laptop has a very nice display, full keyboard and the battery life seems like it will be good.

It is great for watching Netflix movies.Laptop runs very fast, with no problems so far.

These keys have good spacing and are nice and big.Runs quickly when loading videos, loading games, etc. Was able to migrate all of my stuff from my old laptop through my Windows 8 cloud account - yay!If you're looking for a good laptop at a decent price, this would be a solid choice.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Juries still out", "Author": "Jon", "ReviewID": "R2K4J9UKS4KOU0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We've had this for about a week so far to replace an old laptop that burned out after 5 years.  Windows 8 takes some getting used to, but by the end of the night of setting it up and transferring old files, I will say it has mostly won me over.  There are some oddities to get used to like finding the power down button, but it's not bad.As for the laptop, it is great for the price.  It plays all of the games we have currently with no stuttering.  Sims 3 probably being the most resource intensive to give you perspective of what we play.  The biggest complaint I have so far is the lack of a light on the caps lock and num lock as others have mentioned.  It doesn't sound like a big deal until you are trying to figure out why everything is in reversed caps when you accidentally hit the button, but don't see the telltale light to warn you.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and there is plenty of drive space for what we need.  Office and web activities are all peppy as would be expected.We did have an issue getting on our wireless network when we first set the laptop up.
