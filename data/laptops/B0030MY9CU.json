Best thing so far was at start up, it knew we were using Linksys, asked to confirm, and instant internet access.  Wow!  Second thing worth noting is it's every bit as fast as my new HP 500 GB tower.Some of the reviews said the unit gets pretty warm so I ordered a three fan cooler and a wireless mouse.  Amazon came through again as even with these add ons, I still paid less for everything then what Walmart wanted just for the laptop.", "Date": "January 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Hard Drive Eater", "Author": "Candice P", "ReviewID": "R1R5L1MA5HMJ10", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased two of these laptops in Dec. 2009.  The first one had hard drive failure in 2 months.  The second lost the hard drive at the 6 month point.  Now 6 months later (and at the end of my warranty) I'm sending laptop 2 in for another hard drive.  This model is junk.  I wish I had purchased something else.  3 hard drive failures in less than 12 months = FAIL.", "Date": "November 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Runs Well After Some Initial Problems", "Author": "JabberJaw", "ReviewID": "RS7EV5KUG4EH5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'd give 3.5 stars. Few weeks after we got this, the hard drive decided to die. Big bummer...one of those you get what you pay for moments. Thankfully, Toshiba took care of us. We sent the laptop to them and they sent it back repaired, no cost to us either direction. 6 months later, we haven't had any further problems. It was inexpensive and hopefully will continue to hold up well.", "Date": "July 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Too much trouble", "Author": "tbear \"tbear\"", "ReviewID": "R73GWGF308CDJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We bought our 2 for our girls in December of 2009; same as another reviewer. One of the hard drives just failed on me. Got a black screen saying \"Disc Read Error\" that I can't recover from. I'm gonna see if I can find one on eBay.I've also had issues with the other computer slowing way down to a crawl and had to run a bunch of tests and programs to correct that. Hardly anything is installed on either of these computers. Found a bad sector on that hard drive, too, but it hasn't failed yet. Probably because my daughter uses her Iphone for a computer way more than the actual laptop. Hardly anyhing is installed on either computer.The computers run hot as hell, too. Made some setting adjustments to help that but it still nearly burns my hand if I put it right up to the side there after a while. I think the heat is also responsible for the USB drive on the left not working anymore. We got it on a Christmas Walmart blowout special for $225. It's okay, I guess, for what you pay for it and for minimal use, but Toshiba had issues with those satellite computers running hot. I read that they have fixed the issue in later models but I'm not sure I would trust another Toshiba. Oh, and the thing only stays charged for about 45 minutes without being plugged in. That's crap.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "UPDATE..
