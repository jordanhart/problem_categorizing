{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Little Lap Top!", "Author": "Anna Silva", "ReviewID": "R38LNERACP8F84", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I am writing this review assuming that you have a up to $500 budget. So here we go.I will start with the only con so far. The screen: As another reviewer has mentioned, the black on this screen is not very strong. However, make no mistake this is a very good screen. It will only bother you if you are VERY picky with this kind of stuff. I am particularly picky with this kind of stuff and believe this is why I noticed that in the first place. I think most people will actually be very satisfied with the screen.The pros:Price: This is priced amazingly. I was not able to find anything in this price range that was as good. Dell had a special deal for it at $279. I missed it. Later they had another deal for $300, however after tax and shipping it came out to $325. I chose to buy it from amazon new from $350 as a $25 dollar difference was not a lot, plus amazon had 2 day delivery, and I get amazon credits at work. I also get dell credits if I want to, however they have pages of restrictions on how you can use them, so again this made me choose amazon.The Design: This little laptop looks just as good if not better than it does in the pictures. Everybody I show the laptop to goes \"Wow, how much? that's it?\" I looks really high end. It feels really good too. All around it, it feels like this nice rubber. The only other laptops I was able to find with the same features and about same size looked really cheap, like a Lenovo one you can find here on amazon. I found some used ones for a bit more that I believed to be better than this, however I wanted something new, as I was tired of getting broken hand me down laptops and fixing them.Speed: Again, this is a budget laptop, I had it for a week and it feels pretty speedy. Not a laptop to play call of duty or anything like that. But perfect for everyday use and work.Upgradable: You can safely upgrade the memory to at least 8GB, and can put an SSD. It behaves fine as is, but I am sure it will be a lot faster with an SSD and double the RAM.Size: I spent weeks looking for a laptop just this size. This size is perfect for someone that wants portability. It is big enough that it does not make you wish you had a bigger laptop when you are using it. The size allows the keyboard to be big enough that you can type comfortably. The size also allows you to take it anywhere with you. It is really light and can fit in any back pack.Battery: Battery is pretty good. Lasts a lot longer than my previous laptops that's for sure. It has been lasting me a good 6 hours in average.So, if your budget is anything up to $500, get this laptop and do something nice with the $150 dollars you will have to spare.Regards,", "Date": "May 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Portable 11.6\" laptop for the money with good power but with some issues", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R2YIK27HM0NG3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For the money, this is a great laptop with all the ports that you need Ethernet port, card reader (except optical drive & vga). It's a lot snappier than the AMD A6-1450 found on most 11.6\". On the outside, it feels like a more expensive laptop and I'm not lying, I had the Alienware 14 with the same silvery rubberize finish and it felt exactly almost the same on the Inspiron 11 3000. There are some Pros and Cons and I'm going to list them below.PROS- Looks and feels high quality on the outside because of the fit and rubberize finish- Very portable, just 3lb and under an inch- Good Battery life of around 5-6 hours using Balanced Mode at 40% brightness web surfing and light media playing, idle life is longer around 8-10 hours- Decent keyboard with an ok key travel, keyboard also has a dedicated mute, increase and decrease volume button that don't require the FN key combo.- Good performance for the money with the Intel Pentium Haswell 3556u which is snappy and the intel hd gpu can even play some games since this is the intel hd haswell graphics which is faster than the Pentium bay trail hd graphics.CONS- Display is mediocre. The blacks looks grey and it has some grainy look to it. The reason people go for glossy screen is to avoid that grainy/sparkly effect that's mostly used on matte panel but this glossy screen is grainy.- Touchpad is decent when it's working normal but sometimes it is erratic and it freezes for several seconds.- The 3.5mm audio port emits a hissing interference noise when using any headset/earphone", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazon charged me near $100 over list price", "Author": "mdmay29", "ReviewID": "R3B94UIR3ZNV44", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Fine, high quality.

The Pentium is snappy even with the default setup, but being the tech junkie I am, I decided to buy hardware upgrades that arrived with the laptop..I installed:an 8gb 1.35mv stick of crucial ram (about 70 on amazon) and a crucial m500 240gb SSD.After successfully cloning the HDD and booting from the SSD, I noticed an immediate increase in performance - a night and day difference.I clocked cold bootups on the HDD around 32-35 seconds. After installing the SSD, cold boot time is anywhere from 4-7 seconds.The multitasking and HD video is average with the default HDD and 4gb ram, but after upgrades and I can watch stutter-free HD video with the processor underclocked to about 1.3ghz (accessible under advanced power management).If the processor was an i3, this laptop would easily be categorized as an ultrabook.The Pentium is actually nearly identical to an i3, it just doesn't have Hyper-threading, which isn't even noticeable on an i3. But the i3 was not upgraded to haswell, so this little penitum is much more battery-friendly than most of the other, more powerful haswell intel's.Overall, I have no complaints other than fantasies of a backlit keyboard, which would make this product even more premium than a MacBook air, but that's a minor spec and a luxury that just isn't a deal-breaker.Looking for something powerful enough for school but battery-friendly enough for long stints away from the charger?this little bad boy will do the job very well.Good luck and enjoy it if you get it.", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "I like it.", "Author": "Heng Shao", "ReviewID": "R1XL39AGUHQEGG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop for my daily use.

Since my good old IBM Thinkpad X24 died, I couldn't find a good replacement.I was looking for something portable, but with a decent processor, and good battery life. I also didn't want to spend a lot money on it.This little machine gives me everything I was hoping to find, and even more.Pros:- beautiful and reliable design. This thing looks and feels much more expensive than it costs. Dell did a wonderful job here.- very good battery life. I can get 6 hours easily out of this machine, and sometimes even more.- incredible performance. After I uninstalled all the bits I don't need, it was very fast, and I didn't upgrade any hardware (mine came with 4 Gb RAM and 500 Gb hard drive). Pentium 3556U is a Haswell processor, and delivers great performance consuming little power.- light and portable enough to carry aroundCons:- it takes a bit to set it up properly out of the box (disable adaptive screen brightness, lose all the software that slows it down, disable one-finger gestures on the touchpad etc.), without changing those settings and removing default software the system is much slower, and harder to use.- screen could be brighter. still a very good and and sharp screen, but could be brighter.Overall, I would recommend this to all IT professionals, who need a good and reliable portable computer, that is able to deliver performance and long battery life. If you need a laptop just for media consumption and internet, I would look elsewhere, Chromebooks for example.", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works Great with Linux Ubuntu 14.04, 1TB EVO SSD and 8GB Ram", "Author": "Chi Tech Guy", "ReviewID": "R3KA72OHAKN08U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome laptop!!  I got this as a replacement for my Asus eeepc that was about 4 or 5 years old and I wanted an all around upgrade.  The small size makes it great for travelling when I'm not planning on doing a lot of work, or using while watching TV.I also have a 17.3\" Asus as well as a desktop, but I needed this because the small laptop is really more convenient at times as well as lighter to carry.Pros: Works great with Ubuntu 14.04, light weight, long battery life (especially if you use a solid state drive, which gives you a faster boot and keeps it cooler as well), and nice resolution.  Will work with a 7mm SSD drive (this was the main reason for choosing the model), without any major mods, some other laptops work only if you take the casing of the SSD, etc.  And 3 USB ports are a nice touch.Cons:  Small harddrive, non-ssd, only 4GB ram, with only 1 dimm slot, but its not to hard to swap those out and sell the old ones.  Other than that the battery is internal, so you can't carry spare batteries, no CD-Rom, but if it saves weight and space, I'd just assume use a USB cdrom anyway.  And the only thing I don't like is the mouse buttons are part of the touch pad, so if your use to resting your thumb on the button, as I am, you can't do that with this touch pad.The upgrade: the upgrade wasn't terribly hard, however if you've never worked on a laptop before, you probably don't want to try it on your brand new laptop alone.  The bottom of the case comes off by taking off 7screws, 2 of the case screws also are 2 of the 4 harddrive screws, and then by starting from the back and carefully pulling off the case.  Taking off the cover was the hardest part of the upgrade.NOTE this will probably void your warranty and if you pull to hard or aren't careful you can damage the laptop.The drive and ram are straight forward to put in (at your own risk), if you've worked on laptops before, its a good idea to take a picture of where everything is at, screws, etc, so you can refer back to it when your putting the new drive in. Make sure its a 7mm low profile notebook/ultrabook SSD drive, if its a 9mm it won't work.  Also use a precision screw driver, a #1 Philips is too big.I went with a 1TB Samsung Evo SSD so it will have ample room for pictures, etc.  And the ram I used was Crucial 8GB Single DDR3 1600 1.35V (this will not work with 1.5V ram).  4GB is OK but you will likely run out at times, for the money and if your changing the harddrive anyway its worth it to put in an 8GB dimm so you have a laptop that will last. I haven't heard anyone say they got a 16GB dimm to work so I went with an 8GB, which is more than enough for a small laptop.Overall great laptop especially when you add in an SSD drive and upgrade the Ram, and for Linux users it worked for me with Ubuntu without haven't to do anything special.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great for what it is but has some issues ...", "Author": "Mastertune007", "ReviewID": "R1KB9NSDOIE62S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got this laptop through amazon warehouse it was just a dented/damaged box item (new not used or damaged laptop) Had this laptop for a few days now ... And over all I like it a lot is rather fast for the type of laptop it is. Though I have had two main issues with it. One the track pad acts up sometimes and it doesn't work well for a bit I restart when it starts acting up and that seems to make it work right again. 2nd I had a BSOD pop up once so far about 6 hrs after owning it. It didn't reload into windows saying there was no drivers had to turn it off and then it rebooted in to windows just fine haven't had the issue since. Not sure if both of these things are windows 8 problems or not but it seems like they maybe windows 8 is a fickle beast some times it works great other times it make you want to pull teeth...the 2nd issue may be pointing to a bad hard drive but I am going to be putting in a SSD later today so it should fix that any way. Battery life is wonderful at 50% there is 4.5- 5 hr of battery life left if  am im just doing basic stuff online, ect ... screen quality is ok. Id give it a 3 out of 5  there it could have better pixel quality  and color though calibrating it may help color wise. Touch screen wise I wound give it 4 out of 5. It is smooth and easy to use. I'll update if i come across any other problems. * update 5/27/14 Did driver updates to the laptop seems to have fixed the issue with the touch pad. also added an SSD make the computer so much faster.", "Date": "May 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great value for money in a light, compact touchscreen laptop", "Author": "Andrew Shaddock", "ReviewID": "R7J5JGJXU6E6E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used this laptop for only one week.  I wanted a lighter laptop than my previous equipment (HP Pavilion DV6 with core2 duo processor) for use when we travel.  So far it has met or exceeded all my expectations.  The keyboard is precise and easy to use.  The trackpad is fine, although I prefer to attach a small usb mouse.  Being able to use the touch screen gestures in Windows 8.1 update 1 is eye opening.  I am so glad that I opted for a touchscreen.  It has taken/will take me to the next level of expertise/learning in windows 8.1 (e.g. using the mail app instead of my browser), and I am enjoying the process.  I am growing to like 8.1 more and more.I have seen brighter and more vivid screens in ultrabooks at my local Frys, but they cost over three times the cost of this laptop.The Pentium processor is plenty fast.  Windows loads quickly (at least for the time being).  The business related tasks that I do take about 50% longer than on my desktop - which has a Core i5 processor.  No complaints there since most of my frequent tasks can be measured in seconds, not minutes.  I have been able to watch videos without any problems.I have not yet tested for battery life, but that is not a particular concern for me.The laptop looks good, feels good to the touch, and if it turns out to be reliable will be wonderful value for money.", "Date": "May 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great little laptop for the money", "Author": "jaydee999", "ReviewID": "R1XSJ5DW3FJDWF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In my opinion, this weight and size is the best compromise if you want a portable laptop on a budget that you can also work on for extended periods, if neccessary, out in the field. I wouldn't want to work on it each and every day in the office, but neither do I want to lug a big 15.6 incher around with me.  I was also tempted by 13.3\" machines, but even they start getting a bit too bulky and weighty for me at the budget end of the spectrum.  I can't justify paying 2-3 times this price for the true ultrabooks.With the faster Pentium processor and the 4GB of RAM, this is a much better buy than its Celeron 2GB brother, and is perfectly quick enough for my office needs, and programs install pretty damn quickly.  I don't intend to do any video editing or the like, so this is perfect.The touchscreen is responsive, and an added bonus for me, which i can use if I am surfing the net more casually, as opposed to working \"properly\".  With a  wireless USB mouse, that can collapse and also holds the \"dongle\" (bought separately), I am now very well set in my new business.The user guide actually shows you step by step how to upgrade the internal components, so it was a doddle to upgrade the the wi-fi to a dual-band card for the princely sum of $2!I'm actually a Brit, whose son was on holiday in New York, so a big thumbs up also needs to go to  Amazon.com , who let me pay in proper money ( :-)), and were also happy to deliver to the hotel where my son was staying, which they did very promptly.", "Date": "May 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "really nice machine", "Author": "Peter W. Broido", "ReviewID": "R5A76FOW9BTSM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I owned an Acer 1830 T which as best I can recall I purchased in 2008. It had an I 7 processor and 8 gb of ram. Unfortunately the hinge broke. I tried to get in touch with Acer but their web side pretty much has a moat around it except for warranty repairs. This really turned me off and I would ask any of you thinking about an Acer to look at their web site and pretend you need an out of warranty repair. In any case a local shop would do the repair for $200.00 parts and labor and I decided to get a new machine. My research led me to this Dell which I purchased and think it compares well to the old Acer.. Please check the price of it on a number of web sites \u2013 usually Amazon is the least expensive but I ended up buying from Newegg as it was $350 when Amazon was selling it for $399.Having read how easy it was to upgrade to 8 gb of ram and install a ssd hard drive, I went ahead and spent an additional $350 for a solid state Samsung 500 gb drive and 8 gb of ram. You want to make sure it is the correct ram. I purchased DDR3 1600 SODIMM 1.35v  CT10246BF160B from Amazon for approx. $74. You also want to purchase some small plastic pry tools as you must after removing 7 screws,  pry the back of the case off of the computer; I used Splurgertool.com \u2013 purchased from Amazon \u2013 about $14 as these are nylon and will not mar the case as a metal screw driver would, and removed  the cover starting from the back. There are two screws in the middle of the back which are covered with silver plastic. The screw covers were difficult to remove and I used several wood toothpicks \u2013 sort of chop sticks to remove these and preserve them to reapply when finished.I should say that prior to removing the back of the computer, I cloned the hard drive. I tried inserting the Samsung drive into a  Sabrent case BK-210S2 \u2013 another $14 and use the CD which came with the Samsung disk \u2013 Samsung Magic to do this task. Before you can clone a brand new disk you need to format it. I had a great deal of difficulty as I could not format the drive or get Samsung Magic software to recognize the SSD and eventually took the SSD out of the Sabrent case and formatted it with some old Apricorn hardware. This took no time and I then used the Macrium Reflect free back up software to clone the disk. I\u2019m sure at this point the Samsung software would have worked but I have used Macrium in the past and I was fairly frustrated at this point as I had wasted a lot of time with the Sabrent case and until I switched to the Apricorn was unable to accomplish this task.From this point on everything went well. The inside of the Dell is well laid out and the installation of the 8gb of ram and the new SSD were a breeze. Before I closed the case, I ran the computer, the 8 gb of ram was recognized and the new hard drive worked. I closed the case up, and put the two little covers back on.As I used the computer I was not impressed with its speed. I used the Samsung software and was able to optimize the drive. I also fiddled with the power settings on battery and when plugged in.  I believe the laptop is now running quickly \u2013 full boot in about 10 seconds.Some have complained about the black color on the screen or that the resolution does not go to 1900. For me the color is fine once you have adjusted the brightness and a 1900 resolution would be very difficult to read on this 11.6 inch screen.I particularly like the looks of the computer; it has 3 USB ports, at least 2 are USB3 ports a full size HDMI port, Bluetooth and a single jack for ear buds or speaker. I think it compares favorably with ultrabooks which start around $700 and then go up \u2013 they do not have 500 gb SSD\u2019s usually 128 or 240 gb ones so you have a bargain. Generally speaking it is not processor speed which slows down a computer but the hard drive and the video card. I think the Pentium chip is adequate and for my needs which do not include video editing or CAD/CAM this machine is fineDislikes:I wish there were indicator lights on the bottom of the screen or the top of the keyboard to tell you wifi is on, the machine is charging or the cap lock is on.  There is a white bar light below the front of the machine which tells you the machine is charging but not that it is fully charged. There is also a small white led just to the left of the caps lock button, an unusual place but it does indicate the cap lock is on.The keys have a very short travel \u2013 I am use to a longer one but there is no flex to the keyboard. The touch pad is almost large enough to land a plane on it and usually works quite well but occasionally it seems to have a mind of its own. If you decide to disable the touch pad, there is no way to turn it back on without an external mouse.All in all, I like this little guy. My wife uses a Dell Desktop and Dell\u2019s support has been excellent. I expect it will be the same should I need them.  The computer came with very little crap-ware and there are Dell utilities which you might want to use. I think that I now have the equivalent of an ultrabook with a 500 gb SSD for considerably less than one would cost. I hope that I have helped you in updating this laptop.As an aside, I placed the old hard drive in the Sabrent case, connected it to my computer and the drive is recognized. I do not understand why the ssd would not format or clone in the Sabrent case.", "Date": "May 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Value", "Author": "Christian De Freitas", "ReviewID": "R22AT3R76BK3SB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this laptop to change my Acer Aspire One AOA150.
