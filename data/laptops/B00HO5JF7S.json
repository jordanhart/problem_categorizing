{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good every day ultrabook", "Author": "nekojita", "ReviewID": "R2G0APEXS0RJ1I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Asus has a sleek look with its silver brushed metal lid and slightly rounded sides. Between this and it being JUST under 5 lbs, it makes for an easy transport if you want a laptop to carry around.I noticed immediately the ultra-fast sleep mode.  As soon as the lid is closed the laptop goes into immediate hibernation. After opening lid and clicking to un-hibernate, the laptop is back to active within 2-3 seconds.The touchscreen has a sleek design with a black outline around the active screen that frames the look of the screen nicely. If you put pressure on the top of the laptop lid it does not affect the screen at all which tells of the durability of the laptop casing. The touchscreen has very nice vibrant display graphics that allows it to be seen easily from various angles without too much glare.The visuals of the screen are great, which make for impressive video viewing. Picture is great and graphics are very crisp whether it is a Powerpoint still picture on display or a movie. The audio is great, too. While not a gaming pc, this is a nice one for video/audio usage.It is a very thin and elegant design. The DVD multi recorder fits nicely along the side panels along with three USB ports, a microphone jack, SD slot, network slot and HDMI port.The grooved out design around the touch pad is a small detail that has a nice impact on the overall look of the keyboard and touchpad (the touchpad is a bit of a different design with the 'clicks', but honestly, at this point with various keyboards for various devices, I'm used to things being different and just roll with it. But FYI to buyer). Keyboard is nicely laid out with light/'chiclet' touch keys and touchpad is sensitive without being too touchy. Considering that I also have a Asus Ultrabook S500-CA with a twitchy as heck touchpad OOB, this is a welcome relief.Battery life appears to be great as well. I had the machine in hibernate for approx. 6 hours after machine was fully charged and the battery was not even down past \u00bd charge after all that time. And while in use, it does last about 6 hours. Considering the size and weight, that's pretty good.Now for some negatives (or at least not so greats).Fan vent is on the bottom which can be seen as a negative to anyone that works with the laptop sitting on their lap. I would imagine that the fan would be blocked in this instance and would not function properly and possibly allow machine to overheat? Gonna need a cooler for this one while using it for any length of time.No SSD at all?It barely comes in under 5lbs. As stated, I also have a ASUS Ultrabook S500CA, which is a 15\" screen and weighs less. It also doesn't have a DVD drive, so.... You're definitely adding weight here for that and a few other options (and losing USB and other ports).No full Microsoft Office Suite/software (you'll have to pay to get more than a trial version or use something else). Just making that clear. - edited as before I had stated 'Windows'. Sorry for any confusion.All in all, this is a responsive laptop with impressive visual and audio that can be useful to an everyday user. It probably has some drawbacks to someone needing serious processing (no SSD), but for a lot of users, this one is good. I like ASUS, I find them to be reliable laptops, their designs tend to be good, and this ultrabook is no exception.For everyday use, I'd give this 4.5 -5 stars. Anything else, take off a star or two.", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Pretty good mid-range laptop, but lacking a few features", "Author": "Ms. T", "ReviewID": "R3MY4WOTOCSGNG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This ultrabook is pretty nice for a Haswell ultrabook, but I think I'd definitely try to get it on sale  As far as looks, it has a beautiful dark gray brushed aluminum look to it, but unfortunately the cover is a major fingerprint magnet.  This could really bother some people.  It's a small thing, but I wished they would hae made the cover a lighter silver, since the light colors tend to show fingerprints less.The Pros:  Haswell architecture - graphics on this laptop are beautifulLong battery life - I am getting about 5-6 hrs battery life which is really good, I have a sony and two other Asus ultrabooks  that can only get 4-5 hrs battery life, so this is a major deal for this laptop.Screen - the screen on this is beautiful - slightly better than my Sony Vaio t series ultrabook, and compared to the Asus s400ca rsi5t18, this one has a much better looking screen.Another pro, is the charger - it's only one cord vs the traditional two piece power cords and it has the brick part at the plug with fold out prongs - i really think they should all be this way, it's just much simpler and convenient.Also a pro - the bloatware on this is not too bad, didn't really have to uninstall a bunch of programs I didn't want - that's one of the things I like most about Asus laptops.Another pro - this laptop runs incredibly cool and quiet - I never hear the fans or any other mechanical noise from this ultrabook, and it never seems to get even mildly hot.The So-So - This unfortunately doesn't have the caching SSD that my vaio t series and the s400ca has.  This is a huge disappointment, and at this price point, I really feel it should have one.  Without the caching SSD to speed things up, you just don't get the full ultrabook experience. I would have preferred them to leave out the dvd drive and spend the money on the caching ssd.Another not so great, and again, probably due to the DVD drive, it's not quite as light and thin as my other ultrabooks.The bad - the touchpad mouse click buttons are positioned on the bottom center, as opposed to the bottom right and left edges. I don't know why they did this, as it is different from every other ultrabook I have seen, and when I first got it I thought that the trackpad mouse buttons weren't working.The really bad - tear down on this is not as straightforward as some of the other Asus vivobooks, back cover removal requires removing 10 screws which for some reason are not uniform - so pay attention which ones came out of which slot.  My other vivobook has 10 uniform screws on the back and was much easier to get open. After opening the back cover (which took a little more work and prying than I expected)  I can see the wifi card, the battery and the hard drive and the dvd drive, but I could not find the memory modules - I suspect they are under the dvd drive or hard drive.  Not having easily accessible memory is kind of a big deal for me, because I almost always upgrade memory in laptops as it is a cheap option that gains a lot of performance. I also read somewhere, unconfirmed, that the 2gb memory chip is soldered onto the board, and the 4gb is replaceable - which would also be disappointing, since it would mean that the memory is not upgradeable for the average diy computer person.Bottom line - for me personally, I prefer an ultrabook with a caching SSD. I can't rate it 5 stars for this reason, and also because it's not easily user upgradeable. For the casual user or those valuing cool and quietness, this is probably a great laptop, particularly if your into a beautiful screen.", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Overall a nice laptop and a good value", "Author": "Robert M", "ReviewID": "R1VTU5WTMP8EVI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my second Asus laptop and overall I'm still a fan. The display is bright a crisp and the machine feels well built.  Like all modern PC it's platy fast enough for all but the most demanding tasks like HD video editing.  It does have a slightly rough feel around the edge which reminds you this isn't a $1,500 mac book.  But then again it;s about 1/3 the cost.Would make a nice laptop for a high school or college student.  I would also strongly recommend getting a solid state hard drive (SSD).  It's is more reliable, durable ( and a students laptop will be taking a beating), has better battery life, runs MUCH faster, starts up quicker, and runs cooler.  Put OpenOffice or LibreOffice on it and you've got a reasonably priced solidly built machine that should last a student for 3 years or more.PS. Windows 8.1 still stinks but I'm not sure that there;s anything you can do about that.", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amost a \"5\"", "Author": "SrReader", "ReviewID": "R13I2XTK5P9WUI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like this 14\" VivoBook due to the ease of operation.  It is understandable that learning a new task such as how to best utilize a touchscreen can be time consuming.  However, all the ease of the touch screen becomes elementary when used on a regular basis.  I installed Open Office as I did not want to spend another dollar on Microsoft Business.  It works excellently with all components of this Asus.  This Asus replaced an Asus 13 1/2\" that due to grandkids pushing on the cover/screen it separated at the base.  It is still usable without any difficulty but I cannot close the cover....it has now become my desktop.  I love that this one has an optical drive as I burn disks with photos and download specific music to disk to play elsewhere.  The RAM was sufficient and I can add more.  There is even instructions as a \"how to\"...I would have someone install for me if necessary.I have not transferred my PhotoShop as yet, but I will need to do that as the photo editing is not as efficient and detailed as I like to use.  The screen is clear and crisp. This Asus is as compact, lightweight and easy to use as I expected from Asus.

She paid about $650 last year for her HP ultra bookConfiguration wise, they're similar (except the Asus uses a newer CPU)Battery life: the HP ultra book lasts about 1 hr longer than the AsusThe HP doesn't have touchscreenBuilt Quality: they both have metal lid and some metal parts but the HP has nicer bottom.The HP doesn't have DVD drive.They weigh almost the same.In conclusion, for the money, this is pretty much what you'll get. Not a great deal, but not bad either.If you're not in a rush for a laptop, I suggest you to wait a bit more. If the price drops down to about$500 or less, this will be a solid deal. At this price, it's okay, but there's nothing to be very excited about.", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Just as advertised", "Author": "G.

It's a very nice \"mid-tier\" computer - it falls short of a desktop or high-end laptop in speed, display and audio quality, but it has enough functionality to fit its niche quite well.  It is lightweight and surprisingly stylish.  The touchscreen is nice - sort of an attempt to cross the machine with a tablet.  But the truth is that I end up using the touch pad almost exclusively.  The keyboard is solid and the keys are fairly well-designed, unlike some of the flimsier \"low end\" laptops you see out there.In sum, this is a solid computer for routine tasks, at a reasonable price.  It's very portable and capable of running any routine task, surfing the web or even burning DVDs or what have  you.

I will NEVER, EVER purchase another product from this company--EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I had to return 2 computers within a few weeks due to manufactures defect and to make matters worse, I was told by ASUS representative to return the 2nd computer to Best Buy (where I purchased). Best buy told me they wouldn't send it back to ASUS to be serviced, that it was my responsibility. I was also told by another of ASUS reps that i would be refunded for shipping costs. NOW, I am on hold being told another story (yet again) from ASUS rep. that I will NOT be reimbursed the $20.00 for shipping. This company has THE WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE and exports their calling centers to poorly trained reps. You will be given courteous service but uninformed, inflexible, unhelpful, and simply poor customer service. The product is flimsy and you won't even be getting your 600 dollars worth of product.
