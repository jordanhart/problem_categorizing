Dowell", "ReviewID": "R2NQ9V3VKDD1JU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "my wife purchased this computer at wal-mart a week ago. i have to say i'm real surprised, first at the price at second at what a great buy it was. it was on sale for $358.00. the setup was easy and the computer is really a pleasant surprise. it is very fast and has a lot of options i like in a computer. we decided on an acer after she bought me an acer notebook for my birthday last year. it too is a really great computer. this laptop was only $59.00 more than my notebook. i'm by no means an expert on computers, but for what we will need it for, it will be great. i highly recommend this to anyone who really knows their way around a computer. i'm not one for doing really precise and long reviews, but take my word for it, you would love this computer. i'm sure many morereviews will come up on this computer than will go into greater detail than i have, but from my own experience with it, I LOVE IT !!!!!", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Machine", "Author": "Syd Kahn \"Elder Geek\"", "ReviewID": "RI2A1741GO678", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had a few reservations about the slow cpu speed - but it had all the other things i needed - HDMI was the most important.  I was very pleasantly suprised - after loading office and a lot of other software - the machine didn't seem all that much slower than my 1,700$ corporate laptop.  And it ran a LOT cooler - matter of fact it is downright cool.  This replaces a 399 Black Friday laptop that the cat loved - it kept her quite warm.Perfect for a personal travel laptop - and something to surf the web and email from the couch in the LivingRoom.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pretty good.", "Author": "Karissa \"music\"", "ReviewID": "RY5CQIG0QFKWV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got it at Walmart on sale in early April. My main purpose was getting a faster computer with more hard drive (had a 4 year old Toshiba laptop with half a gigabyte RAM and 80GB hard drive) and hopefully playing Sims 3. It plays Sims 3 great unfortunately it doesn't seem to play Sims Medieval. I can be on it for hours (and hours and hours) and it barely even feels warm no cooling pad required.Update: The DVD Drive stoped working about a month ago. A little over a year after getting it of course.", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great value", "Author": "Teri", "ReviewID": "R1YSZO77PIDT2T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm very pleased with this computer, especially considering its price (I got it for $300 at Walmart in April). It's not the fastest or most powerful, but it does what I need it to do. It has a nice wide screen, plenty of hard drive space, and a decent amount of RAM. It is not great for PlayOn video service if that matters to you. The HDMI out is great.Cons: You will probably need an external speaker, as the internal ones are weak.All the port connections; USB, HDMI, power, are on the sides. I'd prefer them them on the back.Not much power.Touch pad is awkward, at least for me. Only one button which is difficult to locate and press. I use an external mouse.Poor audio speakers.Pros: Excellent price.Large hard drive.Nice screen.Runs cool.Decent battery life.Nice keyboard, which includes number keypad.Summary: If you can live with its weaknesses, it is a good value and I'm glad I bought it.", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Stuff", "Author": "Michael Trimmier", "ReviewID": "R3AW3UCJDKH2MO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very pleased with this new laptop.
