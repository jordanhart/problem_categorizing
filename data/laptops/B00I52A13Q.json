{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This is a wonderful business class laptop", "Author": "Michael B", "ReviewID": "R3QXPYIWI5VD3O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great build quality and especially the keyboard.  It doesn't come with tons of junkware which is nice.  You can remove the bottom panel and get to the RAM and Hard drive in seconds which is a must have feature for any business.  I DO NOT LIKE touchpads with no buttons and frankly this one is very good for a non-button pad.  It is still horrible compared to a bog standard pad with left and right buttons.  The screen is basically as bad as screens get.  OK for documents and business stuff but horrible for any kind of color work.  Blacks are grey and the screen inverts when off angle.... BOOI don't know if good screen laptops exist anymore in this price range.  They are becoming harder and harder to find.", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good product", "Author": "L.
