The key is the hybrid hard-drive. It has a 32G solid state drive (SSD) and a large traditional drive givin speedy computing experience and capacity. The hybrid works as well as having only a solid state drive but this allows capacity not available in solid state HDs.The keyboard is good, typical Lenovo. The keys are flat chicklet style. Back lighting is not possible at this price point. I use a LED laptop keyboard light that is USB powered and works better than back-lit keys.Ultrabooks do not have an optical drive so you need an accessory drive to install new software from DVD. There is no numbers keypad; that is easy to give up in exchange for being much easier to carry.Be sure you are getting the 3rd generation Intel CPU. Ads are confusing at the moment and you can get 2nd generation and a non-hybrid hard-drive if not careful. In Lenovo series, look for \"Prime\" in its model name.Along with the third generation chip, the subsystems in the U410 are quick. The RAM is more than adequate for business use; it may be fine for gaming but I don't know.I am pleased and can recommend this laptop atLenovo IdeaPad U410 43762BU 14-Inch Laptop (Graphite Gray) $900.", "Date": "July 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love the laptop; experimented on how to get passed design flaw on WIFI", "Author": "J. Woodward", "ReviewID": "R1W11B3L370CZ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hi everyone, I have had this beautiful laptop (ruby red) for a week now. It is a quality built laptop (made of aluminum alloy) and is often compared to the mac due to its quality build. It has windows 8 which I am getting used to (coming from Windows Vista). I love the 3.0 USBs X2. You do not know how important having those is, especially when I am transferring data constantly for homework and projects for engineering. Extremely lightweight and portable which is important for me since I am moving between classes and carrying this on my backpack all day- need something light. No \"optical\" drive, or CD ROM drive for playing movies/cd's/etc- know that when you are buying this since it is for making it lighter weight; one can work around this by burning the CD on another laptop and transferring via USB OR by buying an external CD ROM. I might need to purchase an external CD ROM since I desire to download photoshop... and there are 8 CD's. Good to know and be informed as you are deciding..But, there is a design flaw in terms of the wi-fi. I was aware of an extremely common wi-fi issue coming from Lenova U series (includes this U410 and U310). People would complain that they have either 1) a disconnecting wi-fi internet problem 2) low signals until very close to wi-fi access.My theory is that since the casing of the laptop is almost 100% thin aluminum, the metal casing is reducing the wi-fi strength. In other words, the wi-fi adaptor is like your cell phone trying to text inside a metal elevator casing- reducing the signal or losing it frequently like when you go through a tunnel. Maybe the design flaw is because they are almost mimicking the mac's metal chassis and they failed mimicking on one key part... like allowing an opening for the wi-fi antenna....Regardless- My love for this laptop will outweigh returning the laptop- for now- as I am currently purchasing an external wi-fi antenna USB. An antenna will test my hypothesis of whether it is the whole casing, which is the design flaw, or if the brand new network adaptor sucks (unlikely but possible).Keep you posted.Edit: 12/6/2012Design flaw averted by simply adding on cheap external wifi adapter. Acts like an antenna to get better signals than many laptops. Yay!I bought a CISCO Lynksis external wi-fi adapter for $49.99- even though on best buy I saw it for half off. I needed internet ASAP, so I went for it (I can always order the cheaper version, then return with receipt for the current to save 25$ once it arrives)- it works! I can even access my n network now. My download speed went from 0MB to 8.6MB; Upload speed from 0MB to 3.6MB on [...]I tentatively recommend getting this laptop and investing in a $10-50 external wifi.Edit: 8/15/2013DO NOT GET A CISCO Lynksis external wi-fi adapter! Its long extension broke. Here is my review link:http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R6U9F61SMVW0/ref=cm_cr_ryp_det?ie=UTF8&channel;=rypI recommend a shorter, cheaper external wifi adapter. Size matters.Otherwise, I am typing on the U410 right now and it is great. Depending on how I am sitting, the abrupt edge can cut uncomfortably into my wrists. The keys are still intact. Sound is a little strange occasionally? Like when I am watching a show voices will 1% of the time sound gargled like listening submerged in an electronic pool. Maybe it's just a software driver issue? My laptop can handle most games I play with my brother. It can also handle engineering software well, especially 3D rendering. I love watching how crisp transitions are between switching views. I could care less about Windows 8, since I normally go to Windows 7 mode (go to desktop). Don't get suckered into Windows 8 UNLESS you intend on getting Office 2013 and/or get a touch screen.I hope this was helpful!", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "A fantastic Ultrabook.", "Author": "David Allison", "ReviewID": "R1YCJ8YGP1XVPZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I needed a solid upgrade from my EeePC (what a terrible computer).

All in all, I was leaning heavily on the MacBook Pro. I swore to myself a little while ago that my next computer would be a mac.

The problem is so bad that even Lenovo doesn't know what to do. Just read the forums and you will find people all over the globe sending their machines for over 3 different times with no successful fix!The internet at my place is a 10mb plan and works well on all others computers and smartphones I have, however, my U410 shows onl 0.3-0.4mb download speeds even if I'm right close to my router!! That is unacceptable! Lenovo says it's a hardware issuae, but how does that work if they can't fix the problems themself?? This company has scre*&^% over so many customers that I don't understand how they are still in business selling this notebook everywhere!Another big issue I have is with the battery. Do not fool yourself into thinking you've got an 8 hour battery that is supposed to last a full day at the office.... hahahaha it's more like 3.5-4 hours at the max on balanced mode! Plus, this unit does'nt have a backlit keyboard, the screen resolutions is a joke at 1366x768, it's thicker than the pictures illustrate and a little too heavy for a 14\" ultrabook.The only pros I find is the processor and the HD4000 graphics which is just as good as the also installed Geforce 610m... yes, go read the reviews on this old video card and see it for yourself what kind of hardware they are pushing to us.This is the most valuable piece of info you may find online:[...]I wish I read that before buying this notebook.PS: No, all U410/U310 manufactured after 7/23/2012 STILL have the same wifi issue, do not trust the administrators from Lenovo!

The potential wifi issue almost kept me away from this nice Ultrabook, but decided to give it a try given vendor's (Costco) return policy. Glad I did... almost bought from Amazon, but got a decent Costco deal after Cyber Monday.My copy of U410 was made on September 23, even though many buyers with later manufactured U310/U410 have WiFi issue. My router is pretty up-to-date, a Netgear N900 Dual Band. Not sure if that plays a role or not. Had the new U410 set side by side with my MacBook Pro (an older i7 version, late 2011 model), signal strengths are about the same. Used Speedtest.net to test WiFi speed, and the results are very similar to the Macbook (10ms ping, 18.5 mbps upload, and 2.1 mbps download).I would recommend anyone interested in U410 or U310 to give it a try.

The computer looks really sleek and is sturdy.  There is no backlight bleed on this at all, the display is very nice, and the sound is pretty good for a laptop.  I had terrible backlight bleed on the new Zenbook Prime and 2012 Macbook pro.  I installed the programs I normally use to see how it runs (office, photoshop, starcraft 2) and it runs really well. The start up time is fairly quick.Cons:No back light keyboard which I don't really need, I know where the keys are.  It's going to be extremely hard to upgrade in the future but I can live past it for the time being (until SSD prices fall) with the factory 8gb of ram and 32gb ssd cache.  Runs somewhat warm.

Chadwick \"geek13\"", "ReviewID": "R31BKCDJI7EK7I", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have had this laptop about a year now. Overall, it works okay, but the peculiar problems it has outweigh anything good about it.First, the touchpad is situated such that I cannot type on the keyboard. Every time I do, any random movement of my hands that stray over the touchpad causes the whole screen to shrink or expand. Alternately, my cursor will jump to a random spot on the screen causing my typing to become completely screwed up.Second, the keyboard is set up very oddly. The shift key on the right side is very small, and very close to the ctrl key. Or there is some other problem, but at random times while I am typing, the keyboard stops functioning and acts as if every key has a different function - p will open a print window, some other key will just close everything.Third, for some bizarre reason, I cannot type on google docs with this laptop. I can have the same document open on this laptop and on my desktop, signed in as the same person, and the desktop works fine. On the laptop, no matter what I type, it all erases itself as soon as I finish (more so in google spreadsheets.) Google says it's a Lenovo problem. Lenovo doesn't say anything.Overall, I would not buy this laptop again - mainly due to the keyboard. The battery goes about 3 - 4 hours - not bad, but far short of the 8 hours advertised.

That's understandable and typical for Windows PC and I have no problem with that. The thing I want to complain about is the updates keep failing. And When Windows tells you there are xnumber of updates are available, I just pick a number for the purpose of explaining, says 64 updates are available, if somewhere along the line, just 1 update failed, the whole thing crashed. When you reboot the computer, the Lenovo automatically restores to the old software or driver. For example if the first 30 updates were successful and the 31st update failed, when you reboot the computer, it will restore the 30 successful updates back to the previous version without asking you want to keep the 30 good updates of not. The only way to get around is to run the update ONE BY ONE if you don't want to junk all the good updates that were successfully installed.(2) I like to leave comments on Yahoo! News stories and also leave comments on Facebook. This damn Lenovo always always and always freezes when I leave comments on Yahoo! stories or Facebook. I've searched on Google and even the Windows/MS website for a solution. Nothing ever works.(3) So when Windows 8 came out, I was among the first user to upgrade my IdeaPad to Windows 8 hoping to fix all my problems once and for all. Not only all my problems are still there, now I have a very tough time to connect to the internet. Although the signal strength are at full bars on the status line. The Lenovo refuses to connect and keeps saying no internet connection. Or if I'm lucky enough to get this ultrabook to connect, within minutes the connection will crap out. although as I said earlier, the signal strength is always full, you can't get the signal strength any fuller. In the end I had to get rid off Windows 8 and fall back to Windows 7. Of course I had to reinstall the hundreds of Windows updates ONE BY ONE. It took me weeks to get all the updates installed.(4) Lately I've begun to receive error that says something about VBasic cannot be found or something to that extent Of course I've searched on the internet for solution(s). There are some suggestions but none ever work as expected.To sum it up, this Lenovo IdeaPad U410 is a piece of crap. It's only 6 months old but I'm dreadful to turn it on.
