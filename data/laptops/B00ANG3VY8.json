{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Worth the premium price", "Author": "Rufus T. Barleysheaf", "ReviewID": "R69382X8ULFAW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've known about Alienware for years now, but had only ever known one person who owned one. I knew the reputation, I knew the look, I knew the reviews. So I replaced my 17\" VAIO with this behemoth. Let's review.FIRST: Sleek, black, huge, heavy - for a laptop. But this is not the kind of laptop to tuck under your arm and lug around the office; you set it down and PLAY. Same goes for the power supply - the thing is comically over-sized. I felt like a hobbit holding it! But with a need for 250W, it has to be that way.SOUND: Without a doubt, the best and richest sound I've ever heard out of a laptop. Bass is strong, the treble powerful. No tinny, cruddy speakers, these.HEAT: The advantage to all of that aluminum is excellent heat dissipation. Also, there are dual air intakes and dual exhausts in the back, directing the heat away from you. (Too many laptops vent to the side!) Playing Borderlands 2 at max settings, the laptop got slightly warm but nowhere near the point of discomfort. So it may weigh down your lap, but it won't singe your short-n-curlies.THE ALIEN FACTOR: Sexy light schemes, MASSIVELY configurable touchpad, set of bonus keys for gaming on the left side of the keyboard, tons of peripheral slots. They know their audience.PERFORMANCE: This is difficult to rate, because nothing I could do was the least bit challenging to the system. \"Crysis 3, maximum settings? YAWN. Tell me when you have some DIFFICULT software to run.\" You are going to have 1-2 years after buying this system of total max-settings freedom. No lag, drag, or latency doing anything.DOWNSIDE: Hardly any. The worst thing I could find in this laptop was Windows 8.SUMMARY: Go big or go home. If you don't mind the heaviness of this game-eating monster, there are no downsides, there is no competition, you WILL be assimilated.", "Date": "March 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Alienware m18x-r2 review", "Author": "wisdomtooth", "ReviewID": "R21ZDQ96RFP9QO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought a M18x-R2 in October of 2012. I was very impressed with the laptop, It is heavy, but I'm not carrying it on an airplane so I don't care. I use this computer to replace my HP 18in laptop (no longer made) that ran so hot that it would turn off from overheating and almost burn my hand near the exhaust. The Alienware lets out very little heat and makes very little noise.  The screen color is brilliant. The one problem that I had, was that when I tapped on the keys, the cursor would jump all over the screen, very frustrating. After talking to support 3 times I finally found out that there was a tap to click option on the touch-pad, once that was turned off the problem disappeared, and the computer has run great ever since.  Support did a good job of taking over my computer to fix the problem, all I had to do was watch them make all the changes necessary.  The computer needless to say is very fast, and runs my programs well.", "Date": "March 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Screen Broke After 7 months.  Now its been a month and Dell still hasnt repaired.", "Author": "Paul", "ReviewID": "R3UX17S9X89JNB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The screen went out August 10th.  Sent back to Dell and they received it August 13th.  Well here it is a month later and they still have it.  AND every time I call them (India) to see where it is and whats going on they tell me they have to escalate the case.  When I ask them what that means they dont answer me.  After 5 times calling, last week they finally told me that the screen needed to be replaced and part was finally in stock.  Well called again and again they have to escalate case.  This is my first Alienware purchase since Dell bought them and I have never dealt with such incompetance with a $2000.00 product.  I personally think they lost it and I will be filing a claim with them at the end of the week.  Save yourself time and aggrivation and order anything else but a Dell/Alienware.", "Date": "September 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "My Alienware", "Author": "Dan", "ReviewID": "R1IMVQ5E9QK830", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have loved this day from the very first day that i got it. I always play games on this laptop and it runs at maximum power non stop. It is the best laptop i have ever owned. I also use skype on it everyday and it never runs out of steam, or ceases to amaze me.I highly recommend this laptop if you are big into gaming.", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "second m18x", "Author": "plokivos", "ReviewID": "R3I9BGHIHHPAYD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My work bought me this, then few years later, I took the plunge to buy this, after selling my Macbook Pro 17.Well, this is the cheaper one, because I bought it on my own. The work laptop was maxed out and costed around $6k.Yes, Win 8 makes no sense. Yes, you need to adjust a lot, and will be frustrated. And yes, you want to get Win 7.BUT! For 2 years I had my old Alienware m18x, I was very pleased. I mean, it's worth the money. The built quality is amazing on this machine, unlike MSI or ASUS, or any other cheaply made machines out there.Everything is perfect, and not annoying. That itself is why I purchased this, even though at the price range, you can get something else with more power, and more glitter. But the thing is, you have to deal with crappy customer service, lack of support for upgrades, and just general frustration of not getting anythign done right. Don't get me wrong, Dell is ridiculous sometimes, if you get somebody who's ridiculous, but most of the times, it's ok.Also, the laptop does everything. This laptop can hold 3 ssd's, 2x GPU, you can upgrade this thing for the next 5 years and still won't be obsolete, and on top of that, if you want to, you can hit someone over the head with it, and it might kill 'em. AND still work afterwards.The heat isn't bad at all, as long as you get it on the flat surface, and everything runs smoothly. EVEN on WIN 8~!The 16gb ram underneath the keyboard is PIA to install, but worth it (you have to take the back out, then take the keyboard out to install the ram), but adding 3 ssd on your laptop is just satisfying.You can hit Windows Experience Index of 9.9 out of 7.9 with this LAPTOP. And people complain about carrying this, because it's too heavy, well, I carried it with me for two years, and never had problems.When you do get this, make sure to delete McAfee first. Not many bloat wear comes with it.Also, you need to do your 100+ updates before you can install win 8.1, if it doesn't already come with it. As well as your graphics driver, and processor updates. I think your Sound Blaster Recon3Di also needs upgrade.Google: Pokki (acts as Start with menu), and Speccy (temp monitor) and install both.Few things:1. If you connect via HDMI out, then the sound will be up to the monitor, because it's HDMI out with sound - ordered CA sub and speakers2. The webcam on top of the monitor is pretty crappy resolution.3. This is the most comfortable, and solid laptop you'll ever type from.4. Win 8 isn't that bad, once you know how to use it. I'm actually liking it a lot, although I have no idea why I have apps, when I can use web browser for most of the apps services for better.5. Win 8 app store doesn't have Pandora... which doesn't matter because you have it on your browser... which reinforces the whole, why do we have apps? Can I use that for Ubuntu or iOS Lion, so I can switch back and forth?6. You're going to hate Win 8. But just treat all apps like apps on your phone, and you won't go insane.7. Keyboard is excellent, no matter what other people says8. The mousepad is excellent, no matter what other people say - you just have to set it up right9. Windows Experience Index always is based on lowest scores10. I'm on PC mode, so after you set yourself up, find this option under User Permission.I was thinking about getting an MSI, but, I know that their lines overheat, because it's just not possible for such a thin and light laptop with that much power to keep cool in that much space. I mean, they sound great on paper, but all the crap I don't have to deal with Alienware is what got me to purchase this.Dell support is pretty good. They have PC Doctor to diagnose my laptop online, and AlienAutopsy is great way to update or diagnose problems with the laptop with schedule maintenance, like a car.BTW, lastly, although onboard Raid on here, it doesn't support Raid 5 or 10 (4hd).Congrats. You can sell this 3 years from now for some money, unlike MSI or Asus or any other laptops.  Very solidly built, like it should be a monument.", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "perfect", "Author": "Pathy", "ReviewID": "R3HQ4OTVUSCK66", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it was expensive, but it worth every penny we expend, the computer is great fast and very nice, so i love it", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Laptop (Well, laptop in the technical sense)", "Author": "Daniel Simpson", "ReviewID": "R1SARKSJ2Q0N4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is probably the most impressive laptop I have ever had the pleasure of owning. Well, actually it IS the most impressive computer I have ever owned. They call it a laptop, it functions like one, it has a built in screen, but it is about as mobile as carrying six bricks along with you. The laptop itself weighs a whopping 12 pounds and change, the power adapter weighs almost another three, and yes, you must have it with you. The 12 cell Li-ion battery lasts about an hour and a half while playing a game. But with dual graphics cards and a quadcore intel I7 processor, it's no surprise to anybody. Speed is incredible with the fitted 16G DDR3 RAM (uses 2/4 slots, 2 x 8G DDR3 fitted). The graphics are fantastic, color clarity, and picture output are both great. I love the aluminum encased keyboard, though this has no doubt added to the heft of the whole device. Has a webcam, not that I will ever use it. Build quality is as good as anything else about the laptop, with sharp edges and a sturdy case you could beat someone to death with it and then go back to COD. If you have the money, you will not find a better gaming rig currently on the market.", "Date": "February 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Beware", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1K6WBCN1JYWK5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After purchasing this laptop it has performed very well and been able to handle any game that I threw at it. However, after owning this latop for 13 months, one month out of warranty the motherboard goes up in smoke \"literally\". Attempting to contact and discuss the issue with Dell and their customer service has been difficult enough but after finally getting ahold of a Alienware tech his advice was \"I guess you could sell if for parts... we are offering some great deals on new laptops\". For the price this laptop costs I expected it to be an investment to last well over a year but apparently that is not the case. I would recommend only buying this laptop if you are familar with building laptops and can handle buying and replacing parts within it as they break.", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Heavy duty gaming laptop", "Author": "Lewis Baldwin", "ReviewID": "RL7VQL2MF6HYP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "While it is a heavy weight - 17lbs - it has an exceptional battery life. I accidentally left the thing on without being plugged in for a couple of hours. It barely registered on the battery meter. The changable lighting is pretty neat also. The disc player is a bit on the slow side and I absolutely hate Windows 8. That said, it is still a user-friendly system.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "FYI", "Author": "Suzannah", "ReviewID": "R2GBW3GO90F8NF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The first one I had delivered came with broken keys and no power source so I don't even know if it worked or not. Amazon's return policy worked smoothly but this \"new\" laptop gets a lot more glitches than any of my other laptops did. Especially driver errors. I'm not sure if it's software related or the laptop but since the first one arrived in the condition that it did, I'm very wary and also wonder if it wasn't reconditioned or something. I'm just too tired to do anything about it but I will buy my laptop directly from the company next time so that I can be sure of what I'm buying.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00ANG3VY8"}}
