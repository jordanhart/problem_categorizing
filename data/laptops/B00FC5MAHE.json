You have to tap the pad for left click, and tap with two fingers for right click.  Well, that's ok till you try to right click drag.  This is not possible.  Also after a few updates, the two finger right click will probably stop working.Next, if you create a restore media on USB, and try to use it to restore, you won't be able to activate your windows.  Not to mention that you need a very specific type of USB stick, and good luck trying to figure this out.  Win 8 machines do not include an install code.  So if you have trouble activating windows, hp won't help except to say that you have to restore from CD.  I haven't tried this yet.  MS will say that you need an install code.  They will sell you one for $40.00.  It probably won't work, and you will have to get a different media set.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "17 3\" i7 4700 1TB Ref", "Name": "Envy TouchSmart m7-j010dx E0K83UAR 17.3\" LED Intel Core i7 i7-4700MQ 2.40GHz 8GB RAM 1TB Silver Notebook - Refurbished", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41dCePB-lvL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00FC5MAHE"}}
