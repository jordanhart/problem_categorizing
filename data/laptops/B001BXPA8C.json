I was afraid it was going to have a bunch of junk files and stuff left behind from someone else, but there was only extra programs. Some useful and some not. I was scared to buy it used at first, but now I'm glad I did and saved the extra money.", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great little laptop!!", "Author": "Homeslicehotel", "ReviewID": "R21CPPM69GA6TP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first time buying a Mac, so I opted for a used Macbook with some decent specs.  I am so impressed by this laptop.  Even being 4 years old it doesn't give any impression that it lacks speed or capacity.  I wouldn't dare buy a 4 year old PC, but this is becoming one of my favorite purchases.  Love it.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not worth it.", "Author": "RLW", "ReviewID": "R1ABV5ZUD7VXSL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The computer was shipped promptly. It seemed just as it was described. Two days past the last day it could be returned, the hard drive died. So it ended up costing a lot more than the $400 I paid for it.", "Date": "October 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Extremely happy with mine", "Author": "Elizabeth", "ReviewID": "R1O5FYIO8SAOIK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my MacBook refurbished and am very happy with it. While I wish it had a bigger hard drive (mine has 160 GB) and more RAM (mine has 4 GB; I can add 2 more GB) it does a good job with most laptop tasks.As of this writing, it is running Snow Leopard 10.6.8. This is subject to change.There are times the fan kicks on and the laptop becomes really hot.I have a great laptop stand for my MacBook by roadtools and it helps keep the heat away from me.One minor point: Heat does radiate out of the bottom left corner. Plus there is a slightly sharp ridge around the MacBook's edge. I find this ridge slightly irritating to the skin of my wrists.I wish Apple still had the MacBook in its lineup as it is a nice bridge between the MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro.~~>> \"I want to die peacefully in my sleep, like my grandfather.

But the seller took good care of one (an old battery)and apple took care of the other(memory slot). I have to admit that apple has very very good customer services! Can't believe that they still provide such good support for a 4 years old used product. Man, I am very happy with that. a 4Gb RAM makes this machine still run fast and can handle my Xcode learning and programming tasks.

When I first received it I tried charging it. Turned out it wouldn't work with out being connected to a power source. So...I purchased a brand new battery for it. Fully charged it and gave it to my daughter as a Xmas gift. When it decided to turn on, it would either freeze or shut down on her. Talk about awkward? The battery and Mac are on the way back.

It runs great and I was able to get all my programs working on it, no problem. Only thing I didn;t like was the relatively small hard drive (160 GB). With modern laptops including a 500 GB drive this was very small. It should be fine though, I'm going to put some music and use it mainly for school stuff, so it should have enough space for me.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001BXPA8C"}}
