I LOVE this PC!  Huge screen, portable, etc.  I bought this \"refurbished\".  I was hesitant, but after reading more about refurbished systems I decided I would do it as they say most times these items are returned for minimal, if any, problems and the problems are addressed prior to selling as refurbished.  I felt especially comfortable because I was buying through Amazon from the Acer Outlet directly.  Set up was easy and as I said I loved it; however, it turned out that my system had ADWARE!!!!  What I thought was my firefox search was being pushed to \"conduit search\" and I had several pop ups no matter what I did.  I googled conduit search and found out what it was and then was able to purchase a program to rid my system of this.  That's the disappointing part of my purchase and hence the 3 stars.  If it was on the PC itself I would have given 5 stars.", "Date": "June 8, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00IO7QS3Y"}}
