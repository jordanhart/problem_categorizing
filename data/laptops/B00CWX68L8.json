The lap top is very fast, has great memory and a hard drive with enough space for everything you need along with sky drive as long as you have an MSN account. I thought the keyboard lit up on this but my mistake and it isn't a big deal. I have no idea why there are some people out there not liking Windows 8 but I have no problems with it and just have to learn how to get around on it. What also is good about this computer is that the battery can be replaced when it goes bad which is a negative for my Toshiba convertible which is a tablet/lap top. I highly recommend this computer and as usual HP makes another good product.", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for the price but missing something", "Author": "DH \"health nut\"", "ReviewID": "R3N8NA6WYZ0KHP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This little thing is lightweight and fast! Seems to be working well, but what I didn't realize was that it does NOT have a CD drive? I have Office and Smart Draw Photo on CD and can not load them on here, so I had to order an additional external CD drive, still waiting for that to come to see if it works, since it doesn't specify Windows 8. My brother, an MCSE, was surprised that it didn't come with some version of Word on it, but it doesn't, you can either purchase Office 10 or use a trial version. All other files from my old laptop had to be brought over on a flash drive. Another issue you don't think about is the touch screen. It's quite staticy, worse than a normal screen, and if you have dogs, it becomes a dog hair magnet. The hair doesn't blow off and when you go to wipe it off, you end up scrolling to another screen. Kinda funny, but something to think about. All in all, great little computer for the price, but be sure to make provisions if anything you need is on CD, and be prepared to step up the vacuuming, lol!", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "omggg!!!!!!", "Author": "Chelsea", "ReviewID": "R399MXEN4R5ENB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love this laptop!! It is amazing!! Especially the touchscreen, the HD quality is soo good its so crisp and clear. Also I love the speakers on this, I can really hear the bass when I'm listening to music. & of course can't forget about the windows 8, it was complicated at first but once you learn how to use it..it's a breeze.

I don't know why I didn't buy it sooner! It's light, thin, fast and just the right size for a college student like me. The windows 8 at first is tricky but after a while you get the hang of it.

I have been using Mac for the past 5 years simply because it runs and windows always seemed to freeze up or cause problems.

I'm not a fan of Windows 8, but that's not the laptop's fault. I like that it's thin and lightweight. My main dislike is the touchpad (\"mouse\") buttons are extremely stiff, a little tough on the thumbs.

The screen doesn't offer much contrast, which can make photos look washed out, and the colors vary greatly with slight changes in angle of view. If I weren't dealing with a lot of photos, it would probably be fine. But it's been very frustrating doing any graphic work and seeing how images on this screen look very different when compared to a higher-end product.", "Date": "September 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Charging problem", "Author": "OSAKUADE KAYODE", "ReviewID": "R2YSYG0KDXB49I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Since the day I open the laptop, the charging has been a problem, right now, it's not even charging at all, I wonder if HP has a quality control team by allowing this type of malfunctioning laptop to be sold out.", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Does this laptop have a cd player?", "Author": "Avi", "ReviewID": "R2Q0ELDU90IS28", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Does this laptop have a cd player?
