It's been a disappointment, as has Toshiba's customer service. I have returned two of the same model due to \"hardware\" issues...and will likely return the third. This could have been a great unit - the case and styling are good, with aluminum construction in parts giving it a heavy, sleek feel. This is too big a laptop to be readily portable of course (17 inches), but is the right size for a desktop replacement. The back-lit tile keyboard is generally good - the spacing is a little wide, which seems to be common with back-lit ones, so there's a finger learning curve, but it's highly visible. The touch pad is a piece of garbage. It's made from cheap plastic and has to be jammed with your finger to function; think early 1990s cheap laptops. I have a Harman/Kardon sound system in my car, and an happy with it. The Harman/Kardon speaker on this unit is not good; it's quiet and delicate - music must be listened to at a low level and with low input levels in order to avoid serious distortion or damage to the speaker. I took the first unit back because the speaker was already blown straight out of the box. No matter of adjusting the input or volume would solve the problem. By far however, the biggest problem is the speed of this computer! In its basic functions it's anything but lighting fast like you would assume a new laptop with 12GB or RAM would be. Part of the problem could be the garbage Windows 8.0 (thanks Microsoft), the loads of annoying proprietary software that it comes with (Toshiba, Norton, games, etc.), or due to the AMD processor itself. As shipped, it's unusable on the web! I tested the DSL speed (with the help of an AT&T; technician) on three different laptops in the house. Every single one tested out with broadband speeds of 5.0+ Mbps - this laptop pulls a paltry 0.6 Mpbs - it's akin to having dial-up! I worked forever to try to identify what the issue was - if there is a particular program or service that was causing it - but again, this was straight out of the box. No out of the box laptop should have a speed like that! I spent hours on the phone with Toshiba \"customer service\" who couldn't explain why it would be slow and kept telling me it must be some software issue. I explained to them repeatedly that it was new out of the box - no software changes by me. They said in order to diagnose any software problem, including their own preloaded software, I would have to purchase a support subscription!! Outrageous! After giving them a piece of my mind and how I wasn't going to pay them to fix their preloaded software, they told me it must be a hardware issue - a faulty wireless card and to take it back to the seller. I returned the unit to the seller and swapped it for a new one. I took it straight out of the box and did a speedtest.net test. Same exact problem - 0.7 Mbps. I tested my old laptop immediately following and got back 5.2 Mbps. Another faulty wireless card? I search online (again) to see if others were having the same problem, but didn't see anything about it. As I last ditch effort I surfed around the Toshiba site looking for driver updates for the Realtek wireless card. I installed the latest one and that did the trick - the speed improved to 3.2+ Mbps. I don't know why Toshiba support couldn't have sent me there first. That said, for whatever reason, the speed of this new laptop still doesn't equal that of the old laptop, which is itself a Toshiba, is running Vista, and has less RAM. All-in-all, I'm really not happy with the performance of this product. Although it has just about every feature I was looking for, it remains comparatively slow. If you don't need a touch screen, I would opt for a Lenovo laptop, which is similarly priced and comes with every other feature this one has, in addition to BlueTooth capability, which Toshiba doesn't include.", "Date": "February 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "I don't recommend this laptop", "Author": "Ambrolla", "ReviewID": "RWY5FYG3DNQY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I chose this because it was one of the decent laptops avaible.
