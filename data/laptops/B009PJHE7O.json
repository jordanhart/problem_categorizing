Then I learn that Vizio is made by the same manufacture who make all Apple laptops, I feel more comfortable to give it a try. Now I have using it for a month, am very happy with it. It's by far the best laptop I ever own. Battery last only about three and half hours continuious usage but I don't bring it outside that much. I still give it a five star and recommend to anyone.", "Date": "March 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Snappy Vizio", "Author": "jeffrey p bash", "ReviewID": "RGZ14JUGLRGYI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an exceedingly fast, well-designed computer with an outstanding screen and solid build quality that I have had for about 3 weeks. This feature set in an Ultrabook is unbeatable at the Microsoft store price!As to issues commonly mentioned:-  I am used to a Dell-style keyboard with black, high-travel keys with white lettering.  My old eyes have had to adjust to (unlighted) aluminum-gray keys with black lettering.  However, as a speedy, hunt-and-peck typist (oxymoron?), I find this low-travel keyboard actually easier and faster to type on than the old Dell style, with no double-typing of letters that some have mentioned.-  It is typically recommended to use it in native resolution of 1920 x 1080.  This can make the screen tough (small) to read.  Make sure to set font size to Large (150%) and use Control + to expand the size of what is shown on various web pages.-  Since I almost never travel with it, I can't comment on battery life and did not subtract for the apparently sub-par performance that others have noted.-  The mouse pad is fine, but I have hooked up a mouse for most use.-  I am not a big user of large photo/video files, so the 256 GB solid state drive (SSD) is way more than enough.  Furthermore, although 4 GB of RAM is not a lot, the super-fast SSD may diminish the penalty on any occasion when the RAM is not enough.-  Windows 8 does not impress.  However, you can easily establish a traditional desktop screen with icons and operate it with a few additional keystrokes (or look for one of the various utilities to restore the Start button, etc). Even worse, Windows 8 does not come with an email utility that works with Verizon's POP 3 functionality.  However, the Microsoft store Signature service was excellent in helping me download Windows Live Mail (in Windows Essentials) to retain Verizon (although that email screen has a faint text problem).-  I recommend buying it by first setting up an ebates account, to get an extra 3.5% back.-  As to the posted comment about the warranty, just buy with a credit card, like AMEX, that adds a year to the standard manufacturer warranty in this situation.", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Keyboard very hard to read, black letters, no memory chip slot", "Author": "herberta", "ReviewID": "R119QEEF4AL2JH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Good value and modern design.

I mean, unreal fast.  Like Muhammad Ali said about turning out the light and being in bed before the room turns dark!Very fast Internet surfing - blazing speed.Wonderful matte screen - - bright with minimal reflections and great viewing angles.Ultra thin.  Wide, but very thin and light.CONSAs mentioned before by other users - - keyboard is kind of funky.  I have not had to0 many problems with it but it's kind of cheap feeling - - not a solid strike like other keyboards.Trackpad has been improved from previous model - - works fine from what I can determine.Lack of USB slots - - only two, one on each side.  But I use a \"Bluetooth\" mouse and two is plenty for me.Lack of card reader - - for $10, I was able to pickup a Transcend USB 3.0 card reader that works just fine.Lack of expandable memory - - 4GB - - but not an issue as long as you are surfing the web or do not require an intensive \"work\" computer with multiple applications running all the time.Battery life - - could be longer as I'm averaging around 3.5 to 4 hours per session.  I keep the screen pretty bright, so I do not mind the recharging cycle.Overall Impression?  So far, I'm very happy with the purchase.  Fabulous screen (1920 X 1080) with blazing speeds.Windows 8 takes some time getting use to.  Typical Microsoft - - release a product that really doesn't provide any great benefit but that is my opinion only.  I had to upgrade (free) to Windows 8.1, which required a ton of \"updates\" and a couple iterations to get it completed - - even with a fast connection.Hope this helps.", "Date": "May 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love it!", "Author": "Angela N.", "ReviewID": "R2D1YNJ32DJ9Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was able to sett it up, by adding my apps.

The screen is amazing (I love the matte finish!), the sound is great, and it's extremely lightweight! I've quite enjoyed the typing experience and track-pad, despite being worried after reading some of the other reviews. The only two things I wish were better is that I would like a back-lit keyboard and the battery life isn't great, as I've been getting 3 to 4 hours, however it's certainly no deal breaker seeing as the entire power cable is super light also so it's not a burden by any means and I'm almost always somewhere with an outlet readily available. I have to point out that the fact the fans are in the screen hinge is quite an amazing change! I've watched 6 hours of videos straight several days over the past week, and it barely ever even gets warm. I only wish every PC had this feature in the first place! Needless to say, the cons aren't anything I can't deal with and I am very glad I made this purchase, especially at the sale price of $720.

Keyboard, trackpad and Screen- Meh", "Author": "SQ", "ReviewID": "R99KRMKRDITDX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I love the size of the screen considering how light it is. This is the closest thing to a full size desktop screen available for an \"ultrabook.\"  The screen, however, is just meh. Granted, I'm coming from a Lenovo y460 THAT computer has the BEST screen I've EVER seen on a laptop, or desktop. It had GREAT contrast and color could see it anywhere, loved the thing - it's just too small. This Vizio laptop.... i was hoping it would look like my vizio 22 inch \"monitor\" (TV), t doesnt. the blacks are slightly washed out, and the whites are a little dull, and the adjustments available to you are very limited (you can do 'contrast' but instead of actually adjusting the contrast, it will make the whites overpowered, not in actual brightnesss, just in how it's rendered, so that it washes out the blacks. Even adjusting the gamma settings doesn't actually make anything better. Imagine if someone had taken the instagram picture editing settings and applied them to the computer screen. Thats what the screen adjustment panel does)With a software update for the screen adjustments, this COULD have a nice screen. The capability is there, it's just that whoever wrote the adjustment software apparently doesn't actually ever use a computer for word processing, web surfing, or anything a normal persson would use a computer for.The springss on the keys are shit. they sometimes don't regisster, sometimes staydown too long, thus leaving two keystrokes where there should be one.The trackpad itself is fine, it's actually the windows 8 software that's a pain in the ass. the left 20% of the pad will whisk you away to their stupid 'surprise, you're now looking at a crappy bing site' application. Eventually, I will figure out how to turn thiss off.  For now though, it continues to be an annoyance.I'll update if i can tweak the screen enough where I would consider it an upgrade from those old flat screen monitors. Right now that's exactly what it looks like, but with better resolution.UPDATE:The keys are now acting BETTER. I've used the computer for roughly 40 hours so far. I've never had a laptop before that needed \"breaking in\" for the keyboard (and this is laptop #6 since 1997)The screen quality is still not anything I'd write home about. My Vizio 22 inch TV makes this thing look like a cheap screen. The settings I've found to give the most readable environment are as follows:Brightness - 11Contrast - 50Gamma - 0.9Hue - 0Saturation - 2They've got the contrast adjustment set to diverge from the middle (grey) VERY quickly. So, if you adjust the contrast to even 53 (out of 100), webpages like gmail become worthless because the \"grey\" and \"light grey\" variations in the inbox all become \"very light grey.\" I wish they'd used the same contrast algorithm that Photoshop uses, as that one is much more useful for adjusting contrast. Or at the very least, made it less sensitive, so you could adjust it more than from just 50-52. PS. VIZIO - you can still change this with a software update!", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good computer for the price", "Author": "Liz", "ReviewID": "RLGRX9VYE0L25", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I expected too much given the price.

In case amazon removes the link, model number is CPPA-A2. Thank you Vizio.I have a CT15-A2 that I purchased five months ago. For me, the laptop is very good in all respects except the keyboard and touchpad, which I would rate below average. Which is pretty much the same thing most reviewers have said.**End of update**But, I am frustrated in the extreme that Vizio will not sell me backup power adapters. I have, both at home, and at the office, setups which basically require moving or disassembling furniture to place or remove the power cord. Plus I always like to keep an extra in my bag so I can just grab my computer and go and not have to mess with the power cord. Every other of the many laptops I have owned I have had three power adapters. But Vizio refuses to sell me one. Its just too much trouble, I guess. I find this customer hostile attitude intolerable. I will never buy another Vizio product.The support people keep telling me to buy a 3rd party adapter, but they can't tell me where. It is because there is no such thing for this computer. I have traveled to accessory stores far and wide and searched the web no end. I did find a website that claimed to have adapters for the CT15-A2. I ordered two for $80.

The computer looks nice if clean and simple is your thing. I played around with it for a bit and it was super fast, as expected. The screen looks really nice as well, though there is some glare.I am returning it though. The first issue I found right away is that they made the area where you open it from tiny. Add to that the fact that it's a heavy hard metal, all sharp edges, and it makes it very difficult to open the lid. I can't even come close to opening it with one hand. And, even with two, I need to hold the whole laptop sideways and pry it open. This might loosen up over time with some wear but I don't plan on finding out, because of the bigger problem..After less than an hour playing around on it, I literally have groove marks in my wrists from where they sit on the edge of the laptop while typing/scrolling/clicking. The edge is hard sharp metal which sticks into you, and after a few minutes becomes very uncomfortable. I can't even imagine spending hours on this machine; it's painful.I was really looking forward to this laptop, so this is very disappointing, and Amazon is probably going to try and take a 15% \"restocking\" fee on the return (about $150) but, to be honest, I don't see any choice.
