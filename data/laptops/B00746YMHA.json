This one I got has 4GB of ram and 128GB harddrive. I use this laptop mainly for browsing the internet and some programming. Now that you have a little background Ill give a quick review.From the get go this laptop is MUCH faster then my previous Macbook air. When you open the lid you are ready to go that second. On the old one I would have to wait a little for it to load and if I left chrome up and clicked on it right away then I would get the loading wheel. I havent seen this do it once. That could be because of the harddrive being so much faster.When I opened the box the laptop was already charged to 91% so im trying to kill it. Well I was on it ALL NIGHT last night and now its the morning and its only at 60%. That battery life is amazing and let me honest thats what we ask for in a laptop.If you are up in the air about this laptop(no pun intended). I would say give it a go. You could even buy it from the Apple store and if you dont like it just return it.If you are replacing an older Macbook air and have one thats because the mid 2012 then I would say get it but if you have the mid 2012 I dont know if I would suggest spending the money unless you really want battery. I hope this helps anyone trying to purchase this laptop.I am not an Apple fan boy. My desktop is a custom build Window machine so I know both worlds. Please if you have any questions just comment and I will be happy to try things for you or just answer questions.I am a Computer Engineer so im use to testing things so feel free to ask.(This is my first review)", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "MBA Will Be Perfect Once It Gets Retina Display", "Author": "Mike B", "ReviewID": "R434HN9G6BT0B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This might look like just a minor spec bump from last years model. However, the new MBA boasts all day battery life: 11 inch (9 hours) and 13 inch (12 hours). This is a big step up from the previous generation. This is due to a larger battery and more efficient processor. The upcoming OS X Mavericks is supposed to be even more energy efficient than Mountain Lion. The MBA is also faster due to the new processor and has a faster wifi connection. The solid state drive in this computer makes it much faster than a regular hard drive computer.This is a great computer overall. The screen is not as nice as the retina Macbook Pro, however it is not a deal breaker. The MBA is a lightweight, portable computer and the Retina screen is thicker, heavier, and more expensive. Once they manage to make a thin, lightweight Retina Display this computer might be perfect. You will probably not miss the disc drive on this computer because it is a featherweight without it and you can use an external disc drive if you have to or remotely access another computer with a disc drive.If you are debating between the 11 and 13 inch models, it depends on what you want to use it for. The extra screen space, SD card slot, and longer battery life for $100 more makes the 13 inch a worthy choice. However, some want a truly portable machine that can fit easily in a large purse or briefcase.If you are debating between this computer and an iPad with a bluetooth keyboard, consider the ease of use and functionality of the computer versus the portability and cost of an iPad. For students, it is nice to have a real keyboard and be able to easily create documents, spreadsheets, and powerpoints on an actual computer, but I see more and more students with iPads and a keyboard case getting by just fine.If you are debating between 128GB and 256GB (or custom order 512GB from Apple), consider cloud storage. Flickr now has 1 TB free photo storage with no size restrictions. Google Drive and Evernote are great for documents and you can always store your iTunes library on an external hard drive if you have a massive library.If you are debating between this and a Windows Ultrabook/ Google Chromebook, consider the operating system, reliability, customer service, and resale value. People love Apple products and you can resell the computer if you want to eventually upgrade. They hold their value pretty well. The operating system takes a little getting used to but it is a lot smoother than Windows and you will probably never want to switch back to the dark side. If you really need a Windows Program, you can run Windows on a Mac.", "Date": "June 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing, am shocked how it far outperforms my older Macbook Air", "Author": "VeritasluxMea \"Neoplatonic Platonist\"", "ReviewID": "R1RAKRYX5GWI32", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Working off formerly a 13\" macbook air mid 2011, I just bought this new 2013 model with the Haswell CPU and low power consumption infrastructure.Off a full charge, I disconnected 3 hours 40 mins and had an external drive connected the entire time, restarted 4 times, and did NONSTOP heavy application installs (Office suite, Photoshop etc.), a total of 23 applications, and ran youtube vids in the background the entire time, and after all of that nonstop heavy loading, I had 76% on my battery, of which id have around 35% on my older Macbook Air.Further still, the entire unit has run UTTERLY COOL during this EXTREMELY heavy loading, installing and heavy 1080P video graphics play. My other Macbook Air would be almost too hot to touch underneath near back under same conditions.Even without 802ac (new Wifi connection thru the new Air), I notice roughly 25% faster throughput on likewise file downloads using my new Macbook Air than that of my older version Macbook Air.This new Macbook Air contains PCIe-Based Flash Storage Approaches 800 MB/s Read and Write. I notice BLAZING fast write speed on my 1.1 Gig Photoshop app, and seemed about 40% faster than my previous generation Macbook Air. Also, this new Air model contains PCIe-based SSD modules made by Samsung and is smaller than the previous Air model SSD made by Toshiba.These new Airs also sport batteries with increased capacity driven by higher voltages: increasing from a 7.3 V, 6700 mAh power battery to a 7.6 V 7150 mAh power battery. Other changes include a redesigned expanded heat sink covering both the CPU and GPU, which must be why this unit runs SO COOL even maxed out.ALL my apps run perfect on this new Air, including Office suite, and the entire Adobe suite and the rest of my apps, ....which it should, its still running Mountain Lion OS.I really have to say again, that write speeds on HUGE app instals is just faster than you dare hope for; its just blazing faster than my previous gen. Air.My Macbook Air has been without a question my most treasured gem of \"go-to\" Mac product hands down, I own all of them (2 Airs, Macbook Pro, MacMini etc),...I was skeptical when I shelled out $1099 today for the new Haswell Air and its presumed prognosticated \"crazy long\" battery life and improved speeds overall; but the hype isn't hype, its real and amazing. The mere NOTION that I can overload this Air with App installs, and have a 2.5\" HD attached for nearly 4 hours, run 1080P Youtube vids,...and still be at 76% Batt life is just, well, its stunning.Tested out the NEW dual (stereo) mic and it IS much nicer in record, additionally the camera/vid is much sharper and  crisper than my other Mac Air.  Considering the price point is lower on these new Airs than the older ones,  I give the new Macbook Airs a \"110%\". Having repaired laptops (non mac) in the past, and owned at least 20X more laptops than most consumers, I don't lightly conclude this is the cornerstone workhorse for everything I dare consider doing, fast got faster, and battery life now is enough to make a crusty \"hates everything\" person like myself nearly cry with joy. Congrats Apple! Homerun on this lovely gem.I didnt get this delivered in one day, I picked it up from my local Mac store, I got my buddy to sell it to me 1 day before they officially \"have\" them which is today 6/12. As for the questions about using this new Air with Photoshop and it lagging on heavy filtering and photo editing, Ive tested that fully and this IS the machine you want for ultimate portability, it works fantastic.Also of great importance is that this version of Mac Air is supposed to have \"nearly double\" fast write speeds as the Macbook Pro Retina. And the new Hard storage on this Air has \"up to 6X faster than a 5400RPM disk drive\" as found in current Macbook Pro which contain 5400RPM Toshiba Hard drives (made by Hitachi for Toshiba actually). In short, YES, this is a perfect \"must own\" book in the field or travel use for photoshop work, with just blazing fast write speeds, and crazy long battery life.This new Macbook Air brings TRUE definition to being \"disconnected\" and \"portable\" to those who want to do a LOT of work free of the power socket!

However, I received many good arguments to buy the Macbook Air and was finally convinced because all the other laptops working under windows I was considering had problems of some sorts, as reviewed by many users. Therefore, I bought the Macbook Air with a 14-day trial. I thought I would bring it back but I never did and ever since it's been a love story.Even though you've probably already heard it all, here are overall the best things about the Macbook Air that makes it the best laptop out there (even with the new Macbook Pro):-Battery life is excellent and recovery is fast. There are several ways to make the battery last longer and some options in your settings.-It's SUPER light, which is a major plus for a college student if you need to bring it to class and around. After a few weeks working with it I was surprised how big and heavy other laptops seemed to me, you have no idea.-The design is very nice, but that's a somewhat subjective notion.-It really doesn't take long to get the hang of all the commands and you might discover some cool \"shortcuts\" by accident, like I did. The experience is just wonderful and if you need any help, there are just so many websites and blogs that can help you and have tutorials or problem solving for new-to-Mac users like me.-The operating system upgrades are free, unlike Windows'. The new OS X Mavericks is just amazing, it's slick, stylish, colourful and just so much adapted to a student's needs!-You can work on many screens, so multitasking is made easy.-If you're Windows-nostalgic, you have the possibility to install a parallel. Plus, the Office for Mac is mainly the same as the Windows one except there are maybe more templates and the designs are more aesthetically appealing. You can also install Google Chrome, Mozilla and other browsers, as you wish.-Internet-browsing is fast and you can zoom/unzoom pics just with your fingers and the trackpad.-The trackpad is life itself in the form of a technologic device: it just feels so smooth and you almost feel like you're the one moving the page like you would with a book or magazine.-The new OS X Mavericks gives you iBooks for free, and iMaps and you can add a map or directions to your events on iCalendar.-If you have an iPhone or iPad, you can sync them with your Macbook and you just have an infinity of possibilities and uses.I hope this was useful and that it helped you in your decision-making process.", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Macbook Pro 13 Retina vs. new Air 11", "Author": "A Customer", "ReviewID": "R1EG9KS4GK7MDJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "These reviews really helped me when I was figuring out what to buy, so here are my two cents. I couldn't figure out if I wanted the Pro Retina or the Air, and I wasn't sure if I wanted 13 in. or 11 in. Now, I actually own both the Macbook Pro 13\" Retina and the new Macbook Air 11 inch, and I understand most people won't want to buy both but these are my thoughts. I first got the 13\" Retina, because I loved the screen, esp. the way text looked because I read a lot and it made such a difference. I have the i7 version, plus the 8 GB RAM, and 256 hard drive. I love that thing. It's gorgeous and fast, a pleasure to work on. BUT. The only problem with it for me is the weight. I know it's lighter than it used to be but I'm petite and when I'm traveling and need to give presentations, this thing is in my bag the entire day, and I find it heavy. Many people may well be stronger than I am but I personally find it a pain to drag around when I'm on the road. Also, the battery life is good but not brilliant, so if I use it all morning and a part of the afternoon unplugged, it's dead.So I recently bought the 11 inch Macbook Air as well, the new version, also maxed out, i7, 8 GB, etc. It is so light, it's amazing. It' lightning fast and the battery life is incredible. I can use it and use it and the battery won't budge. However. The screen is so much less good than my Retina Pro. I'm not a picky person and before I got used to the Retina screen, I didn't mind but now, it's a huge difference. The text is pixelated and very small, the whole thing looks much less good.Basically, I think that if you're going to be mainly stationary when using the laptop, I would definitely go for the Retina Pro 13 inch. At home, it's all I use nowadays. It's a joy to use and looks amazing. However, if you travel a lot and will mainly be using it on the go, I think the new Air is fantastic.  I hardly notice it in my bag and the screen is fine, just not as beautiful as the Retina, plus the performance and battery life are incredible. If the weight of the Retina doesn't bother you, that would be the clear choice.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "A battery that does what a laptop needs / Volume Fluctuation Issue", "Author": "Publicagent \"Publicagent\"", "ReviewID": "R1Q0F7VTF30P2S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been using the new Macbook Air for almost a week now. I actually started with the 11 inch because I wanted the lightest possibly laptop, and I used to have a smaller screen, but I guess it was just too small. I was noticing things like a shaking screen and I had been using a 15 inch Macbook Pro with the aluminum keyboard for the last five years. When I got the 13 inch, everything looked and felt just right.In my opinion, a laptop battery has one major task. It should allow users to do everything they want on their laptop without having to plug it back in. I used it for about 1.5 to 2 hours two evenings in a row doing internet surfing, minimal video watching, and some word processing. The next day I used it for close to 8 hours of word processing and internet surfing. You know you have an amazing battery when the bar goes red, and you check to see that you still have two and a half hours remaining. I did not check exact times, but I think I got over 11 hours before charging it back up (including 3 days of sleeping). I was also surprised to see that it had recharged before I went to bed!In this day and age, laptop users should understand that you never get the same amount of battery life watching non-stop high quality videos as you would using basic software and the internet. I use a laptop fairly frequently for projects/entertainment, but can not think of one instance in which I would need over 12 hours of battery life. More than 8 hours and my eyes start to blur. The bottom line is that Apple's initial estimate of 12 hours is not off, and I am happy to say that I will not be taking my charger with me anytime I plan to return to my house to sleep later that evening. I don't have to worry about battery life for the first time.One small quirk is that the time estimates of the battery are sometimes off. For instance, I have checked my battery status and seen an estimate of 17 plus hours remaining. I admittedly got overexcited before it quickly went back down to over 12. The percentage is always accurate, however, and it's intriguing to see how long you can last with 100% battery life remaining.As for the rest of the computer, the keyboard is great, the screen is nice, but not stellar, and there is a slight glare when I work in direct sunlight though it's nothing objectionable. I think that Apple has set a new standard with this laptop because it's obviously light, but the battery is truly amazing. It's also picking up the internet feed in my house as good if not better than my other devices.IMPORTANT UPDATE: I have noticed an issue with volume fluctuation when watching movies on Netflix and sports on ESPN. The issue persists on Safari and Firefox. Unfortunately, other are having this issue and no one that I could find as of yet reports it as being resolved. This is a shame. This laptop is so good otherwise I am still giving it 4 stars, but this is a major issue. I have downgraded to 3 stars until this gets resolved.UPDATE REVISED: The volume fluctuation issue appears to have been fixed with an update. Loving the laptop again.

We have an older 17\" Macbook Pro that has been through the war and still functions perfectly. Since day 1 this MBA has dropped wi-fi connections everywhere continuously, and despite doing everything by the book-phone support and software upgrades, genius bar appointments, higher level support,etc, and 3 swap outs for other machines it still drops wi-fi. This is a widely known issue worldwide, yet Apple still has no fix for it. They continue to sell it and then ignore you or make you jump through senseless hoops for no reason-there is no fix. Was contacted by an Apple engineer who made me run a diagnostic and send it to him. He said he would help me-never heard from him again.After my last genius bar appointment, after running a diagnostic that proved the drop, the best they could offer was for me to upgrade to a retina-pro-at my expense. I really like the machine otherwise, but Apple has really dropped the ball here and in my opinion is committing fraud. There is much speculation on the forums as to why and how, but as consumers its really not our problem to diagnose or fix.They know its broken-its a widely known issue world wide, there is no fix, yet they continue to sell it.

Portability is a very underrated advantage.  Great to use at bedside. Easy to carry around the house or in an office setting. So light, you can pick it up with one hand and lay it down on the floor while in bed without moving.2. Doesn't get Hot and you don't need a lap desk - MacBook Pro models don't get hot relative to PC's but are more hot compared to the 'Air3. Battery lasts a very long time. Lasts longer than MacBook Pro models especially retinal display4. Very Fast - solid state hard drive not a disc so very quick loadingCons1. Display isn't as nice as the MacBook Pros particularly the retinal display.2. Only two USB ports and thunderbolt  port. No SD port. No Ethernet port3. No Disc Drive \"Optical Drive\" but none of the new Mac lap tops (MacBook Air or MacBook Pro models) have this. Also it wouldn't be a MacBook Air if it had the disc drive(would weigh more) so it's a moot criticism. I already owned a separate disc drive than I can easy attach through a USB port and I never need to use it anyway since everyone can be downloaded online. Only time I need it is to watch DVD'sWhy Mac over PC1. No Spam - search the internet in peace without multiple pop-ups and adware slowing your computer down. No viruses2. Not Windows! - I recently experienced Windows 8 on another laptop and it is atrocious. I'm so glad I don't have to deal with Microsoft products and Windows. I can't believe they found a way to make WIndows more cumbersome3. Intuitive - Macs are designed with human intuition in mind. Everything is designed to be simple and easy to use. You don't need experience with Macs to use this. Since 2007 when Macs began to use Intel chips, the Macs took the best Windows had to offer and improved upon it. You can even buy Microsoft Office for Mac (which I have) so you lose nothing.  So if you are scared to use a Mac, you will find these new Macs are very easy to use.4. Great Service in Apple Store - if something breaks down, Apple is great about replacing parts, computers and honoring warranty.5.

The all aluminum chassis has a pleasing texture, it is lighter yet feels far more solid than any other ultrabook I have encountered. The hinges have no undue give, yet there is little effort needed to engage them.The trackpad is a marvel. After only a few days I am amazed I ever used a Windows laptop without proper OS trackpad integration. Every flick and swipe is picked up and acted upon without hesitation, it is a shame this responsiveness is so alien when coming from Windows.OSX is very polished, lightning fast on this SSD. I find myself much preferring it for every activity I use my PC for besides gaming. Swiping between fullscreen pages is intuitive, trackpad gestures are tight and do much to streamline navigation. I feel more compelled to recommend it to clients, no more ad-ware, no flavor of the week virus infections. No embarrassingly mid-life crisis 'reinventions' to fight with as in Windows 8. One OS for desktops and laptops, separate OS for touch-enabled devices.802.11AC Wifi! I can finally use my lonely 5GHz band! I have not experienced any wireless dropouts or hiccups as others have described.Haswell architecture has enabled an unheard of real-world 10-12 hour wireless browsing battery life while packing a fully featured quad core i5 chip with HD5000 graphics. Unprecedented for this size and weight. HD5000 tackles Skyrim at comfortable mid-level graphics and playable frames, at the expense of extreme system heat.Built in bootcamp allows easy Windows 7 dual booting for those OS specific applications, still eeking out 6-10 hours depending on usage, providing a better Windows experience than Microsoft themselves.CONS:Maybe HDD space? All my music is stored with Google, photos and documents on Dropbox and Skydrive. Install Office and Photoshop and still have 90GB left.This is not really a con, just a function of nature. Packing this chip in this form factor means heat! Working in OSX is fine, doesn't break a sweat. Once you bootcamp Windows 7 and try on your gaming pants however, expect this thing to live at 99 degrees celsius with fans full tilt.I used to argue against Macs purely from a price point perspective, but for $999 (bought at Best Buy) I feel this machine is a steal. I can see myself using this system for the next three years easily. With no mechanical hard drive and sturdy construction it will take quite a drop or impact to take this thing out.In closing, the Macbook Air shows that a carefully controlled eco-system can work in the right hands. As opposed to leaving manufacturers to their own devices and quality control standards, Apple has examined every facet of their platform and made purposeful design choices, polished them over several generations and realized them with very strict hardware standards.I have experienced the Windows 8 bombshell from ground zero. Poorly implemented and designed manufacturer software, random black screen freeze ups and hundreds of other software bugs, 5 different operating system recovery methods for 5 different manufacturers, it no longer makes sense to me.I have been assimilated into the cult of simple OS interface and reliable, controlled hardware platforms.", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's small, light & the battery lasts FOREVER.", "Author": "Jonathan Edwards", "ReviewID": "R2CS3FXYZFYE3I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I sat at the store debating on the 11\" MacBook Air or the 13\" MacBook Air for about an hour the day I bought this laptop.

The drive and laptop in general is amazingly fast.+It has the just released new wifi protocols which will future proof the laptop for some time.  The wifi on it is amazingly fast and out performs all other wifi devices using the some internet source that ive tested.+It has the legendary apple keyboard and track pad which are the best I've ever seen on any laptop regardless of price.  The track pad especially is amazing... if you've never used an apple track pad you have no idea what your missing, it literally controls almost every function on your computer except for typing and it's very intuitive and easy to use.+It has the newest integrated intel HD graphics (5000) which are faster, better and use less power than any other laptop.  Very few other laptop options have the HD5000 graphics chip.+It has Haswell processor.  It is very fast and very efficient.+It has 12 hour battery life (continuous use).

Numerous negative reviews on the laptop refer to specific manufacturing defects (wifi, laptop body defects, ETC).  If you get a good one, you're good, but you might not be able to notice a defect until the return period has passed.If you're on the edge, this is the laptop to buy if you want a light, portable machine that is fairly high powered.

It was small but noticeable, so I returned it and got another that was in pristine condition. Any Apple executives out there reading this, please check out this store. I don't know if they're repackaging returned products or what but this was the second time I purchased something from there and had to return it because of some issue.The Macbook Air was a better choice for me over the Macbook Pro Retina (which I kept for three days and returned), and here's why - (1) better battery life (until they come out with the new Haswell Pro's)... you will get 12 hours at least if you're writing and doing light surfing or watching Youtube videos. If you turn off wifi and bluetooth, you may get more; (2) smaller and easier to carry, hold, etc. (this factor might not sound much but it makes a huge difference and is probably the #1 reason why people love their Macbook Airs); (3) less expensive (which means I was less paranoid about it); (4) and for some reason, the screen doesn't hurt my eyes as much. It's strange but the Retina display hurts my eyes after a few hours. (5) the keyboard is great right out of the box so it's easier to type on than the Macbook Pro. I had to work on the Macbook Pro for 3 days before the keyboard was soft enough for me to type faster. Also the fact that the laptop is shaped like a wedge also helps me type faster and is more comfortable for me to type on (Apple exec, please take notice of this for the Macbook Pro's).Concern?: the monitor is a bit looser than the Macbook Pro. For instance, if you adjust the viewing angle, the Macbook Pro was stiffer. But then again, I am a perfectionist and I notice little things like that.Conclusion: if you want one of the most reliable brands out there, and you like ultrabooks, the Macbook Air in my opinion is your best bet. Just make sure to check every detail before you keep it. And it sure does beat using Windows 8. Damn that OS is ugly and close to unusable. I have no idea why anybody would want to touch their monitors. I'm probably in the minority, but I think tablets aren't really efficient for productivity. It's harder to cut and paste, use word processing software, etc. I'm more productive on a laptop... and I definitely don't want to touch the screen but that's just my personal preference.

Let system idle and wait for display to dim (based on power settings).2. Wait a couple more seconds for screen to go black.3. Wait a split second more for keyboard backlight to begin to fade.4. Before keyboard backlight is completely off, press a key or swipe the trackpad (as if trying to prevent the system from sleeping, thus requiring re-entry of password)Expected Results:I would expect the system to wake up and let me continue with what I was doing.Actual Results:When touching the input as the keyboard backlight is fading, the backlight illuminates brightly, but the screen stays black.

It took me back to the time a number of years ago that I did the same to people who chose Macs over PCs. That was in the days before iPhones and iPads, even before iPods. At the time, it seemed that everybody except a few college students was using machines that ran on windows.  I remember bragging about how great my laptop was and what I could do with it.Fast forward to today, when we use an iMac at home, iPads for a variety of tasks and I carry an iPhone. I have gone through a succession of MacBooks, from a basic MB to a MB Pro that I loved. I had reached the place, however, that I just carried my iPad with me in a nice Zagg case with keyboard. I wasn't sure I would ever carry a laptop again.My travel got bumped up a bit this year and I found some weakness with my iPad.  I'm a touch typist who found that the loss of my bluetooth keyboard or airplanes was more than a small disruption.  I was also missing some robust software that just couldn't be matched by the company's IOS app.  Therefore, I decided to try out the 11.6-Inch MB Air.  Here is what surprised me:1. This Air is so small and light that I have no problem carrying it and my iPad with a smart cover.  The weight gain from this little computer is negligible.2.  My former MB Pro had 8 GB of memory and I was concerned that this one only had 4GB. The updated processor and the SSD drive make the new computer significantly faster.3.  The keyboard is full-size and helps me stay focused on the screen, where my work is taking place.4. The display itself, though small, is just enough workspace for the word-crunching that I do.For those who are considering a migration from windows, imagine life without the \"blue screen of death.\"  Think about the ease of document management between your laptop and those other i-devices you probably already have.

[REVIEW EDITED JULY 10]Battery Life---------If you change the brightness to about 75% (this is the level at which Apple did their testing) you ought to easily get 8-10 hours of use out of the computer. From online comments, it looks like other people are getting better results from their batteries after the first charge cycle, so if you are having problems, discharge it once (I went down to 7%), charge it, and see if that doesn't help.Should you Upgrade?----------You ought to see a huge performance boost upgrading from a 2011 or earlier Macbook Air, but is it worth it to upgrade from the 2012 Macbook Air to this one? Probably not for most people, unless battery life is a critical factor for you (it is for me). Some of you might notice a small performance bump, but most (including me) won't. Physically, with the exception of a tiny hole on the side for the mic, it is also indistinguishable from last year's model.11\" or 13\" ?----------I wrote a review of last year's model here (http://www.amazon.com/review/RLCO4ZC1NVQMD/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm), where I extolled the virtues of the computer. Everything I said there applies to this year's model as well, and my only complaint (the battery life) has been addressed.

I was playing music professionally and touring around the country. The Pro was solid for 4 years straight without a single issue. However, I decided to quit music and return to academics, and upon doing so I had to sell everything in order to afford tuition, including my Macbook Pro.For the last three years I had been using a cheap, yet incredible for what it was netbook (Lenovo X100e ThinkPad), but mid-way through the Spring '13 semester it died on me. I had been wanting another Macbook for a long time, and I used this as an excuse to get one - I was very excited.I ended up purchasing a brand new Macbook Air 11\" and for the first few months I was very happy with it - it was everything that I remembered being great about Macs, and more. However, two months ago I installed a new OS update via the App Store. The computer immediately crashed after the update was completed, and when I tried to restart it the computer booted to a flashing hard-drive with a question mark - it couldn't find the hard drive.I decided to just turn it off and let it sit for a while, and upon returning to it and turning it on the bootup went normally and it was working fine again. I figured it was just some weird glitch. Thirty minutes passed and all of a sudden the computer froze - only option was a hard reset. Again, the same problem - it was not able to find the hard drive.I scoured the forums and found that this is a fairly common issue. I did a full wipe of the HD and reinstalled the OS (twice) and the issue still remains. The computer freezes and crashes about 1 to 5 times a day. It randomly does this, and it randomly decides to work again.Now, the significant issue that I have had is that I'm a poor student who doesn't have hundreds of dollars sitting around waiting for me to be able to leisurely spend - I have enough trouble buying enough food every month and I literally live in the cheapest apartment I can find, with wonderful amenities such as cock roach infestations, drug addicts, etc.I called my local Apple Store and explained my situation - the computer was brand new and I had even purchased some kind of 1 year warranty when I purchased the computer (which was over $100) and I asked them what they could do. They were quite rude and told me that they wouldn't do anything until I paid them $300 for extended 3 year AppleCare. I only found this out later (via a more friendly call rep from the national Apple Store) that there was a student discount for the AppleCare.The local Apple Store rep certainly knew that I had purchased the Macbook at the student discounted price, yet he didn't even bother mentioning to me that there was a student discount available for the AppleCare - he evaded it all together and attempted to con me into paying the full price, which I refused to do anyways - the computer (at the time of calling them) was only 3-4 months old!I was infuriated, and this is when I called the national Apple Store hotline - I thought that perhaps I hadn't explained my situation properly, and I didn't want to deal with my local Apple Store again. This is when I found out about the student discount, and I have to be honest and say that the call rep was very friendly and wanted to help me; however, the situation was the same - he was requiring that I pay an additional $200, on top of everything I have already paid the company, before they would even consider looking at it.I find this downright appalling. I shouldn't have to pay $1300 for a brand new computer from a giant company, have the computer fail after the company releases a software update 3 months later, and then be conned into paying an additional $300 before they will even consider looking at it for me.Maybe my expectations were too high given the exceptionally high quality of my old Macbook Pro, but either way I find this situation to be quite absurd. This company should take care of its customers.I won't exaggerate and say that I will never buy an Apple product again, but I am definitely in the process of selling the Macbook - probably at a financial detriment - and giving my business to another company (probably Lenovo again).The Macbook Air actually seems like an overall great product - when it works. I suppose that if I forked over the $200 that all these problems would go away, and it would cover me for an additional two years. I do honestly think that $200 is reasonable for the amount of time of coverage. However, my experiences with their overly rude customer service and the principle of the matter is what upsets me most. This is why I have decided to extricate myself from the company at this time.Obviously this is just my experience, and I doubt that it is a common one as I'd imagine most people have the extra cash to spare ($300 is $25 shy of covering 1 month of rent for me, so it's a big deal - especially given the circumstances of it being a brand new computer). If you have the extra cash to spend, then I would recommend the computer, but a part of me (the biased and irrational part, perhaps) is giving this product a 1 star due to my experience and is suggesting that you seek out another company to deal with.", "Date": "August 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Impressed", "Author": "Paul L.

The machine was universally declared a loser accompanied by predictions of Apple's demise.  When 2009 produced no sequel to the first Air, it was pretty much assumed that the Air was gone with the wind.  But then Apple surprised everyone, including the experts, by not only releasing a new edition of he Mac Air in 2010 but adding an 11\" model to the original 13\" screen.  Both machines caught on with users, receiving  high recommendations from Consumer Reports, and eventually leading to the phasing out of the laptops with optical drives that the Airs had replaced.It's no secret that computer sales are getting trounced by tablets and mobile devices and that the Apple managed to lose much of its polish in 2013.  But things would have been much worse without these exceptionally practical, lightweight, sleek machines (so thin and light I always seem to have trouble finding it in my shoulder bag).  I purchased the 2008 model, then immediately sprang for the first 11\" model (anything to lighten the load).  I doubt I could ever return to a heavier machine.  The 11\" Air has proven a reliable work-horse, quick and practical in every way (as they say, the best camera is the one you have with you).  If the photos and print are occasionally a trifle small (and my eyes aren't getting younger), clicking on the capital \"A\" in the menu bar is sufficient to enlarge and clarify the picture.The major improvement of the 2013 over my 2010 model is a backlit keyboard (a return to the keyboard of the original 2008 Air), plus twice the storage of the basic model and, above all, a long-lasting battery (easily worth the step up).  I tend to run my screens bright and wasn't get much more than 2 hours' use out of a single charge.  Now I can use the machine for 8 hours or longer without a charge.I purchased the 2013 machine past the mid-way point of the cycle (an upgrade should be due out in June or July) because the price was right (Apple's discounts are refurb models are generally worth the discount), and I simply don't see how Apple could possibly improve the machine.

It's simply a great laptop, and gets tremendous battery life. Windows also runs okay in boot camp, but really requires an external mouse to do anything useful. The trackpad works in Windows, but it's not really a good experience (navigating and especially right-clicking are somewhat unintuitive and cumbersome).I'd like to point out a couple things that are more particular that others might not have mentioned or that potential buyers might be wondering:- For coding, it's more than adequate. Running a 10,000 particle custom C++/OpenGL SPH fluid sim, I got about the same performance as a baseline-model Mid-2012 MBP that my coding partner was using. For XCode, I can run the iPhone simulator on my apps and games at the full 60 fps. All this can be attributed to the HD5000 GPU. For raw CPU compute power, it won't be as powerful as a recent MBP and will be comparable to the previous generation MBA, but that's the tradeoff for the 9 hours of battery life.- For graphic/2D design, it's got enough compute power for pretty much anything, but the screen leaves something to be desired. In a pinch, it works, but you'd be better off with something else as your primary laptop.- For 3D design / CAD, its got enough compute power for basic objects, but you should try to keep the poly count of the scene/model fairly low, as the HD5000 isn't really intended for such use.- If you are a user of Lyx, it is very problematic on Mavericks (10.9). I've yet to actually get it working, and other users who seem to have gotten ti working report a lot of error. You'll either have to use Lyx on Linux/Windows, or revert back to writing up in pure Tex/LaTex.- If you are a Windows user, there are many applications you can get that more closely replicate the Windows experience.

I've been waiting for a laptop that gets 10+ hrs in stock configuration (I'm not counting thinkpads with battery slices attached), and this laptop has totally met every expectation I've had.  It really has transformed the way I use my laptop and how readily I will consider packing it when going out/away.  I'm happy with the non-retina resolution.  It appears to be a fairly high resolution to my eye when compared to my most recent laptops.  It runs completely silent 99% of the time - the only exception is when I run a game that taxes the GPU.

With all I find myself doing on the computer for school and work, 3 hours of battery just didn't cut it. I bought the new 2013 Macbook Air (13\") for two main reasons:1) I wanted a bigger screen size. The 11\" model, while gorgeous in its own right, was just too small for me. Too much scrolling, not enough space for my palms when typing and very small text on the screen. I know there are ways to fix that by spreading your fingers out on the trackpad to enlarge the text, but c'mon...I shouldn't have to do that :)2) I NEEDED a longer battery life. For gal's sake, it has been quite the struggle to find ANY respectable computer with a decent battery life. I hate having to charge up two or three times a day. Without internet or bluetooth, and the lowest brightness setting, my old MacBook Air lasted maybe 5 hours.Needless to say, the 13\" model nips both of these problems in the bud. Not only is the 13\" more enjoyable to look at (higher resolution, bigger text size, larger trackpad, etc), but the battery life is quite impressive. (Now I'll add a disclaimer in here: Apple says to expect up to 12 hours of battery life, but I don't think they mean 12 hours of continual use. I used this thing for about an hour and a half --light browsing/word processing, a little more than half the brightness--and it went from 100% to 85% in a little over an hour and a half. I mean, nothing to really complain about, but it's not as strong as I was led on to believe. Maybe I should decrease the brightness some more?)It is true, the 13\" is a bit heavier than the 11\", but I still consider it highly portable and easy to take around. It's a super fast and quiet machine, and contains all the beauty one would expect in a Mac. Oh yeah, and the price? Definitely worth it! If you want to save $100, you may want to consider the 11\" model, which is going for $949. I guess it just all depends on what you'll be using this machine for.All in all, 4  out of 5 stars (I'd do 4 1/2 if I could).

Super convenient.- Multi-touch on the trackpad, I don't think I can ever go back to old trackpads.  There's a slight learning curve but once you start utilizing the multi-touch gestures regularly, the efficiency is great.- Even though I practice good computing practices, after a year or two of use, I would always have a few nagging issues on my Windows machines.  Usually issues could be fixed by running malware extractors or registry fixes, but there would always be *something* and I found it to be good practice to do a complete restore every other year or so.

Since there are a lack of peripherals on the MBA, I had to get a few adaptors, namely a Thunderbolt display port for second monitor expansion, Thunderbolt Ethernet port, USB port expander, and the standard stuff you'd need for any laptop: Wireless adaptor for non-BT keyboard, a few thumb drives, headphones, iPhone/iPad charger, SD card holder and adaptors.

The battery life on this incredible! It's a fully functional computer with a tablet battery life. I chose to buy this because the \"12 hours of battery life\" advertisement. At first I was slightly skeptical thinking that 12 hours is 12 hours of doing absolutely nothing on the computer and was expecting more like 9 hours of battery life. Once I got it however, I realized that 12 hours really means 12 hours on this laptop (sometimes even up to 15 hours)! At least according to the battery percentage thing on the Mac (which is surprisingly accurate as well). Of course if you're watching HD movies or playing games it would be a lot less, but under normal circumstances (normal web browsing and some normal work like word, excel, and powerpoint) you really can get 12 hours out of this thing!I have yet to drain the battery of this thing. Closest I've been is about 60% on a weekend where I was on it whenever I had free time. Also, 1.3Ghz may not sound like much, but somehow everything runs so smoothly (I was able to play World of Warcraft on this thing with the default \"good\" graphics, with 1.3Ghz... wtf?!). The fan is so quiet that you'd think it doesn't have one until you start doing intensive processing, however under normal usage you don't even know that the fan exist. I personally think that if you're going to go with a high end iPad, might as well go with the Macbook Air. You can do so much more with the same amount of battery life, and only a couple hundred more than a high end iPad.This thing is so lightweight and portable, you can pretty much treat it like a tablet anyways (especially if you get the 11 inch version). And if you need internet, just use your phone to tether. Worried about phone draining when tethering? Just plug it into your Air and recharge it while it tethers internet for you! I honestly think this Macbook Air will finally be a computer of mine that'll last more than 2 years. I've had many PC computers and laptops, and nothing has wow'd me like this Air has.Oh, and last but not least. The entire thing is solid state! No moving parts!

These discount put the MBA into my price range and I couldn't be happier.It's really an amazing machine. I'm not a fanboy of Macs or PCs. I've used PCs since the '80s and know my way around them pretty well.The instant-on features and battery life of about 10 hours makes this more like using an iPad than I ever would have thought. It's great to just pull out and get to work; no startup delay, no looking for a plug, and it's silent (I don't know if it has a fan, but I've never heard it). The SSD makes programs open nearly instantly. And it comes with Pages, Numbers and Keynote to get you up and running with productivity apps.Biggest pluses over everything else:- Best trackpad I've ever used: I never would have thought I could get used to a trackpad after almost unusable experiences on nearly every PC laptop I've used. It's huge, sensitive and nearly always makes sense after just a couple minutes of figuring out the gestures.- Long battery life: This really has all-day power. No need to find a plug or carry a bulky cord (this cord is actually not much bigger than an iPad cord and very portable).- Macs seem to make better use of screen space. It's hard to look at an 11-in Macbook and realize that's the same screen size as Windows netbooks. Multiple desktops, smart use of full-screen and fast gestures to navigate them help a lot.- Light and well built. Macs are known for this and it's no joke. Every aspect seems well thought out.Things to consider:- I got the base model because it was available but 256 GB would be a lot better than 128 GB. (Base OS install is about 12 GB; another 20 for included apps, Photoshop, MS Office, Xcode; 10s of GBs more for music, and that space goes quick). You really need to think about what files you need to keep on your computer and shift some to external backup drives. The extra space would all be available for downloads, pics, files.- There are still some things the iPad does more intuitively with dedicated apps, like keeping your Facebook current and Pandora playing.- More RAM. I'm not a power user but there are times I think I've got too much going on.- Retina display would be nice.Bottom line: With an external drive this makes a perfectly fine desktop replacement if you don't run ridiculously intensive apps -- you probably know who you are -- and if you're not a gamer.

The Air is PERFECT for my use.- It is SO LIGHT. So light. I just can't believe how portable this computer is. I use a MacBook Pro for work, and the Pro feels like a huge brick compared to the Air. I do a lot of casual web surfing and work alike on the couch with the laptop on my lap, and the Air is just perfect for that. It's light, it's compact, and it doesn't get hot.- The battery, oh the battery! This machine has amazing battery life. I charge it every few days. Right now I am just doing web surfing and I have 83% left...which it says is 10 hours and 49 minutes. My brightness is at a little less than half, which is how I usually keep it, because I don't like high brightness and that really kills the battery life. Although even with the highest brightness, This Air would last several hours on one charge.- It turns on and off in a a second or two. When I press the power button the computer is on SO quickly, it's unreal. Gone are the days of waiting for various programs to boot up. The Air gives instant gratification.- It's silent. Truly. No matter how many hours I'm on it, I've never heard any noise out of this thing.I have the 128GB solid state drive. I was worried at first that this wouldn't be big enough, but didn't want to pay the rather large price difference for 256GB. Honestly, I've discovered 128 is just fine. I can't store every single thing I own on here, but we have an external hard drive for that. It's changed the way I use my laptop, but that is fine with me. But then, I am not a person who has some enormous music library or owns an expensive DSLR camera and spends lots of time working with huge, high res images. I am, as I said, a casual user. 4GB of RAM is also just fine for me.I wish I had owned this computer in college - it would have been so perfect for those days where my laptop had to travel around with me everywhere!Anyway, I completely love this computer, and I would recommend it to anyone who uses computers like I do.

This list can vary from dorm necessities to simple pencils and paper,but one of the key objects in this list should be a reliable laptop.  The functions of  laptop for  college students are vital due to the technological dependency our society has now: researches are made online,everything must be typed and assignments are on the web . Picking a computer can get tricky due to the vast choices available in the market ;however knowing exactly the needs of a student can help. The Apple Macbook Air 13.3 inch can be an exceptional purchase  for all college students who are looking for the foolproof laptop.  There are many components needed to be able to categorize a laptop as foolproof, instead of just simply helpful or ordinary . One of them including remarkable features and reliant performance. The Macbook Air 13.3 inch comes with many programs a student can benefit from such as: Safari, Office Suite and iCloud. Having iCloud can be favorable since this program allows you to store and share data between other apple devices, as well as syncing to do list and notes from one device to another. This laptop comes with password assistant assuring your documents are safe and HD graphics making everything on this computer clearer and more enjoyable to look at.Macbook Air's features expand from a 128GB storage to a 12 hour battery life, reassuring you that there will be enough storage for all important paperwork and enough battery to take notes in a classroom per say. Aside from these unique features the Macbook Air 13.3 inch is well known for its ultra thin exterior and professional look.  The difference between a laptop and a desktop is that a laptop's purpose is to be adequate  for people on the go. A college student would greatly fall under this category. The Macbook Air 13.3 inches, as in the name is 13 inches in screen, weighs about 2.38 pounds and is .68 inches thin. Compared to other devices this laptop is very easy and accessible to carry around. As a student books and heavy backpacks are enough of the weight, having a light backpack is always a pro.  Having the top of the line, best quality isn't always easy. As everything, this laptop has its cons. A Macbook can range from $999-$1299. Even though the price is eerie and can scare customers off there is reasoning behind the price. The Macbook Air includes a one year warranty that can cover anything that goes wrong with the computer. For example, if a speaker stops working you have the chance of getting a whole new laptop. Another reason for the high price is that its made by a worldwide known company: Apple inc.Lastly,the Macbook Air will be a one time money's worth purchase due to how durable the laptops tend to be due to the aluminum body design.  An enduring and  dependable laptop has to have many characteristics and programs to do its job completely. Due to the lifestyle of a college student,the expectations of a laptop can be very high. Even though the price can expand a student's' budget the purchase can be worth carrying out if the pros of the computer are noticed. The Macbook Air 13.3 inch is a reliable laptop that every college student should consider buying", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Thinking about buying another", "Author": "Carey Hull", "ReviewID": "R1UD52TITV45Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just bought this for my boyfriend- It's the perfect size, very light, very easy to use, and battery lasts a long time and doesn't heat up.

I called the Apple support line and after a 2 1/2 hour session, the technician felt it was a defective computer as nothing seemed to fix the problems.  Amazon sent me a new computer which arrived within 2 days of contacting them.  I returned the defective computer and have had no issues with the new one.

Its faster then my Mac Pro Desktop with 32 GB of Memory. The reason this MacBook Air is so fast is because the Solid State Drive HHD & Haswell Chip this technology makes this thing FAST. I have the MacBook Air all MAX Specs i7, 500GB Hard Drive, 8GB Memory. I chose this MacBook Air over the MacBook Pro because the all day battery life and YES this thing will stay on all day no problem I never seen this laptop die on me. Battery life is a lot more then I can ask for. The sleek design is the future of Apples laptop the MacBook Pro will be redesigned to look like the Air. It is such a pleasure to own this laptop. The look of this laptop is so much better looking then the Air and unless you are running multiple high level programs at the same time you can't tell the difference between a Air or Pro. The Air definitely blows any older MacBook Pro out of the water with the NEW HASWEL Technology. I build websites use high memory running programs like Adobe Photoshop, Dreamweaver, I write code on Python IDLE Shell. I use Xcode to build Apps. I use Final Cut Pro for youtube commercials. I do Internet Marketing and this Computer runs all my high lever programs like butter. I have a Mac Pro Desktop it doesn't have the new Haswell or Mavericks but it has 32 GB of Memory and Has a Regular 500GB Hard Drive and I use my MacBook Air for everything I was surprised how fast it runs. Don't let the specs fool you with the Haswell Technology this computer is SICK. I think this laptop is underpriced I think it should be more. I been using Apple since 1995 My first Apple was the Performa 6320 which let you watch cable TV on your computer. I remember my mom bought it for me and it was over $3k. I have been a Apple user since I was a child. I learned how to build websites on one at the age of 12.  Remember owned a Apple computer please don't waste your money on a windows computer. You never been on a computer unless you used a Apple Operating System. Windows is pure garbage. I wouldn't use a windows computer if you  paid me. I think the BBB should not allow Microsoft to sell Windows OS other programs they make are good. But windows should be illegal to distribute fact being it is worthless garbage. That being said the MacBook Air is the perfect computer for a person buying a Apple computer for the 1st time or a professional computer programer. It is very safe to buy the MacBook Air because it will be around for a very long time this design is the future of laptops.

I was a little hesitant at first in buying electronics through Amazon Warehouse Deals but at close to a $100 discount, I thought I'd give it a try. The MacBook Air itself is lightning fast, even compared to my 2012 MacBook Pro, probably courtesy of the SSD drive and it can re-boot in 15-20 seconds once it's been upgraded to OS X Mavericks. Keyboard is not as light as the Macbook Pro and harder to type but I've been using it for a few days now and getting used to it. The best improvement I got, compared to the Macbook Pro is that the Air doesn't heat up. My Macbook Pro heats up after a few hours, to the point, where it is impossible to use it as a \"laptop\" as it literally burns your lap!

Add a Retina Display", "Author": "Tim", "ReviewID": "R34ASYV146E484", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is by far the best laptop on the market at the moment. The only thing that could make it better would be a higher resolution display (such as the Retina display) but I'm sure that would lessen the 12+ hour battery life. And yes, the battery does last over the 12 hours stated. I went an entire day at school using my MacBook Air from about 7:30 am to around 6:00 pm, practically on my laptop the entire time for those nearly 11 hours. I had to use Adobe Connect video conferencing, which is a battery killer and on my old computer would be below 20% with a full charge after my Adobe Connect session of about 1.5 hours. On this powerful machine, its always at about 80% to 70%. Occasionally lower, but rarely. On that day, I believe I made it home with over 20% charge left and a time remaining of 2.5 hours. Another thing about the battery to note, I got it down to 3% before and got a 30 minute estimate. 30 minutes! With 3% left. Sheesh. I have regularly went days with heavy internet browsing for 6-8 hours and had 50-60% battery remaining. It takes two days to kill the battery apparently!Enough about the battery. If you are switching to Mac from Windows (or contemplating it), just stop reading all these reviews and buy the darn thing! 4 gigabytes RAM has been plenty for me: someone who regularly has 5-6 safari windows open, all filled with 5-10 tabs. Yes, I know, thats horrible of me. But, it still runs blazing fast. Even running apps that take up high cpu, it will still run fast thanks to Apple's implementation of App Nap.The keyboard is amazing. Its very nice, easy to use, and obviously high quality as it should be. The trackpad though, is where half your thousand plus dollars are going (not true, but... the trackpad is amazing). The trackpad is responsive like it should be, and literally everything can be done with gestures. One/two/three/four finger motions in different ways allow you to go forward/back a page in Safari/Chrome/etc. w/o having to click a back button. It makes even the easiest things, well, easier! There's also the option of having multiple desktops, so no more switching between windows in one cluttered space. Your able to have say, in my case, 5 desktops open. And use each for a specific thing. Say desktop 1 for school work, 2 for work, 3 for social networking and news, 4 for movies, videos, pictures, etc., and 5 for the miscellaneous stuff like shopping. That way you can have full screen windows without having to share a space between so much stuff. And you can leave all you stuff open on say desktop 1 when working on a project for school w/o having to minimize it and do the four-finger gesture to the right to begin working on documents for your job, or move over to your Facebook on desktop 3. You get the picture, multitasking is easily done and very efficient on this machine. Also, you get the iWork Suite for free, Apple's versions of Word, PowerPoint, and Excel (dubbed Pages, Keynote, and Numbers). Thats well over $100 savings from Microsoft. If you only need Word and the others for the basic you should be good with Apple's versions. Just a note though if you do use them, I'd advise to save them in Word formats by going under 'Export' to... as someone with Windows won't be able to open it up even though you sent it as \"Windows Friendly.\" If you depend on Microsofts stuff though, just get it and be done with it.There are two small glitches I have been having and others have been as well (Google \"MacBook Air 2013 slow wifi\" or \"MacBook Air 2013 kernel task\" for proof). The first of the two is the most annoying. It has to do with select routers so it may not affect you. It only happens when I am at home. Randomly, the internet will work at a crawling pace. It only does it once in a while (like few hours) and for a minute or so. Never has it happened at school or elsewhere.The second is simply where kernel_task takes up 100% cpu for no reason, drains your battery rapidly and bogs down your Mac. It requires a restart. But the thing is, a restart takes 20-ish seconds. No joke. If you can't wait that long for a restart every couple days when this occurs to fix it while we wait for Apple's fix, I don't know what to suggest. Start up from being completely shut down is about 12 seconds. It takes about the same to shut off for me, only because I have so many windows open though that it must close. And they re-open automatically upon restarting as if they were never closed.One final note, the 128 gigabytes of Flash is plenty for most. If you won't be saving videos like crazy, only pictures and such, you'll be fine. I've downloaded tons of stuff and still have 90 gigabytes left. I only had about 100~ straight out of the box though.

I travel a lot for work so I wanted something small so I could take both my personal and work laptop on business trips. Others in my family have the Macbook Pro. I went with the Air mainly for the portability, thin size, and weight of the Air. But the long battery life is what really sold me in the end. As far as choosing between the Air and Pro:- Everything is wireless now so I didn't need the physical network connection.- I bought a USB 3.0 hub to get additional USB ports.- I also go an external HDD for backups and movies, plus I got an external DVD writer.The SSD disk drive is really nice. New programs install in a matter of seconds. I have found everything quick and snappy, in general. Much better than my Windows 7 Lenovo.Other than the excellent battery, I think my most favorite thing is how cool this thing runs. My work Lenovo runs hot and I need a laptop pad to keep from sweating. Even with the pad, that thing still gets me hot when sitting with my feet up and the laptop in the lap. This new Air is hardly even warm. I always use it without the pad and have no issues. It really is a night and day difference.This is just a nice and sleek machine all the way around.

I bought this laptop to replace my aging Asus U6 laptop running Windows Vista.  I decided on the Macbook Air because I also own an iPhone and iPad, and wanted to own a Mac notebook to complement my i-devices, and fully move over to the Mac ecosystem.  I'm going to review the MacBook Air in several aspects and then provide an overall review.Build Quality: 10/10. Extremely well built, and doesn't feel flimsy at all despite the thin and light design.  Coming from a Asus laptop that was 4.6lbs, this one feels light as a feather.  There are essentially changes to the build design compared to the 2011 and 2012 models.  The one physical feature that is different are the dual stereo mics versus the single mic, which noticeably improved background noise cancelling during calls, and helps improve the accuracy of the dictation feature.Power: 8/10. The 2013 Macbook Air packs the latest Haswell processors from Intel which promises improved graphics and better power management (more details in battery life review). This is the perfect laptop I've wanted for everyday use. If you are looking for video editing intense gaming, I believe the MacBook Pro would be more suitable.  For everyday use such as web browsing, Office computing and video chatting, the Air is great.Battery Life: 10/10.  This is the key feature that convinced me to finally upgrade my existing laptop.  The new MacBook Air boasts up to 9 hours of battery life, up from 5 hours in the 2012 models.  After using the MacBook Air for a day, it has certainly delivered on the promise!  My old Asus laptop only lasted 2 hours at max, so I am definitely very happy about the longer battery life.Screen: 8/10.  With the release of the Retina MacBook Pros, I can't rate this a solid 10/10, even though to me the screen looks perfectly fine.  The viewing angles are incredible.  I find myself having to adjust the lid much more infrequently compared to my old Asus laptop.Sound: 8/10. When the volume is maxed, I felt that the sound was adequate.  A cool design feature is that the speakers are actually underneath the keyboard, yet the speakers are still very impressively loud and clear sounding.Expansion: 4/10. Both RAM and hard drive are not user replaceable.  Make sure you choose the desired configuration for the RAM and SSD at the time of purchase!  My rationale for choosing the 4GB RAM and 128GB configuration is that 4GB is sufficient for everyday usage (not video editing or intense gaming), and I will be using the MacBook Air at home most of the time, so my external hard drive is readily available.Overall: 10/10.  Despite scores that were lower than 10 in some of the individual components, overall I feel that the MacBook Air is the perfect everyday device, and there is no other notebook that better suits my needs.  In terms of build design, battery life, portability, this notebook delivers.

Finkel \"Jack of Trades\"", "ReviewID": "R3QM8SU5NKD5XT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The 2013 Macbook Air updates the 2012 model with an upgrade to the new 4th generation Intel i5-4250u Haswell processor.  This processor is faster, much more efficient and offers a significant boost in graphics performance thanks to the HD 5000 integrated gpu.  While a faster i7 is available for a reasonable upgrade price, for most users there won't be much of a difference.  Coupled with the SSD, everything runs amazingly smooth and snappy.  Also, the i7 has the same HD 5000 gpu, so games won't see much benefit.  While this isn't a gaming computer, most modern games (not new FPS's) run well at low to medium settings at the screen's maximum 1440 x 900 resolution.  There are only 4gb of RAM, but that should be more than enough for the average person (you can upgrade to 8gb, but it is soldered on, so no post-market upgrading).This laptop is easy to fall in love with.  At around 3 lbs and 0.68\" thick, it is extremely portable and comfortable.  Despite the lack of weight and thickness, it feels durable and does not flex easily.  The aluminum body is sleek and luxurious.  The screen is only 1440 x 900, but it looks wonderful (unless it's put directly next to a retina macbook pro) and while it is glossy, reflections  are not a problem.  While I still prefer my mechanical keyboard and mouse on my desktop, the Macbook Air's keyboard and especially the trackpad are easily among the most responsive and comfortable of any laptop.  The wireless always keeps a strong signal from any room in the house and the battery life is exceptional at 10-12 hours.Overall, we have been extremely happy with our new 2013 Macbook Air.  I feel like most other laptops have at least one or two annoying issues (and that's not including the bloatware).

I was coming from a budget HP clunker so anything in the Apple realm would be an enormous step up, but I couldn't decide between the MBP with retina, the cheaper \"regular\" MBP or the Air. I am a college student and I bought this with traveling in mind. Almost 6 months after I bought it, I can safely say this is one of the best consumer laptops you can buy, even if the new retina MBP has the same guts as this does.+ Battery lifeObviously one of the biggest selling points of this laptop. The battery is larger in this than in previous generations of the MBA, and with the Haswell processors and newly available Mavericks, my MBA easily surpasses the 12 hour mark under normal usage. I should also note that mine has a core i7, and that hasnt affected the battery life at all.+ SSD (256gb)I'm going even going to try to get technical with this, but this things drive is BLAZING fast. Like, up to 700 mb/sec fast. I transferred my entire 57gb music library from the MBA  to a USB 3.0 external drive in 90 seconds. The SSD is the reason why it boots up in 10 seconds, wakes from a cold start in 1 second, etc.+ Haswell cpu/Intel HD5000 gpuI am very impressed with the performance of this chipset. I haven't done much in the way of heavy gaming but it can handle Borderlands 2 without a hiccup. I have yet to tap the full potential of the i7, the only part of this entire system that causes any sort of lag at all (only when im gaming or filesharing) is the RAM (I would suggest you go with 8gb).+ Keyboard and trackpadThe keyboard on this is absolutely phenomenal. As if the keyboard on the previous MBP wasn't good enough, this one is better. The keys sit a tad lower, they have more give, and are more clackety than before. The backlighting is also brighter.Trackpad is the same sublime unit from previous Airs and MBP's. Nothing is different except the new assortment of gestures that come with Mountain Lion (or Mavericks now that it's released)+ OSXI hear people say all the time that OSX is a horrible OS for programming and gaming. Anytime you to get creative, there is something in the way. I personally have no need to program and I'm not a heavy gamer. But if I were, the Steam online store is there and growing everyday...OSX is powerful and refined, yes, but the best thing about it: seamless integration with other Apple peripherals. iCloud has made the functionality of this thing go through the roof. My ipad and Ipod touch are synced with icloud while my icloud is synced with my google cloud, so my android is integrated too!Aside from the standard complaints that Apple customers are entitled to (quality control and so on), this really one instance with Apple in which you get what you pay for. Mine was around $1500, which sounds like a lot. And it is. But compared to other ultrabooks which wear the same price tags, this is very clearly the most well refined and secure choice you can make. Apple has stuck to the winning formula and improved it year after year.

Phones, Lap Tops, Computers, iPads, and iPods Even with a few glitches at times here and their all Apples products are reliable and durable.One amazing about the Mac is the light weight it has. Being a college student and always needing my lap top attached to my hip, I don not want a heavy 10 pound laptop. I want something durable and light that I can just throw into my backpack or purse and not notice the weight difference. With the light weight I can take is any where and everywhere and it barley takes up any space either.But one thing I love the most is the 12 hour battery life. I am able to do work all day long on the go and I don't have to worry about my battery life and loosing all my work I worked on. Being on the go and not always near a power source is hard when it comes to keeping things charged.A add on though for the Mac is the 2 usb sources instead of 1. Having 2 usb ports is such a life save when it comes to a college student or even just a person always on the go. I can charge my phone 24/7 while I put in a a usb to save and transfer all my school work.Having a Mac book pro is one of the most amazing things for being a college. I love having it with me to be able to always look things up. I can carry around a lap top with no problem at all. The mac is one of the most reliable lap tops yet, i would never ever trade it for anything else. My life is my lap top it is my savior at times. Apple is the way to go no doubt about it.

This is a little bit of a Windows rant but I figure it might be useful for people looking into a new PC/Laptop.The main reasons are as follows:1) I need full disk encryption.  I want to protect personal data in case the computer falls into the wrong hands . I believe this is something every laptop should have, possibly every desktop.  Otherwise if I lose my laptop, anyone can get all my family pictures, bank statements etc.  To have this feature with the previous (relatively new) computer I needed Windows 7 Ultimate or Windows 7 Professional. W7-Pro does not have it.  I had Windows 7 Pro.  So I upgraded to W8 Pro via employer provided license.  What a huge mistake.  Windows 8 is the worst operating system I have seen in many years.  Even early Linux was friendlier.  Ugly design, confusing , settings all over the place, split personality, etc.  Then I thought, well , my wife is really used to Windows, so I considered getting a Windows 7 Ultimate license.  Then I found that in order to have full disk encryption you need TPM module in your computer, or you need to boot from USB drive every time.  Mine doesn't have it.  I considered Tru-Crypt, but I will not install a software that I have no idea who writes it and very few smart people in the world are able to build from source.2) I want easy back-ups.  Time machine is really hard to beat in ease of use.  Plug in a USB drive, you're done.For some people the two above reasons might not be relevant, but for me they are.Back to the MBA 11\".What I like:-Solid build.  Aluminum.-Magsafe power connector.  Very easy to plug , unplug. Compact. \"Looks\" safe.  Haven't tried pulling it, but the MBA will probably fly .-USB3, but you can get this on most new laptops.-Thunderbolt is there, even though I use it as mini display port.-Camera is pretty good for what I use it (Skype etc)-It's very light and easy to carry.-I love the size.  Compared to my Macbook Pro 13\", it's much lighter and easier to carry.  If we are going to do serious work we need a bigger screen anyway, so no need to carry a 13\" around (more on the screen below)-Battery life is excellent.-Runs pretty cool, so far.-Mac OS has a consistent user interface (on par with W7, but much better than W8)-Airport Mirroring.  Mirror almost anything to the AppleTV if you have one.-Full easy-to-use full disk encryption (FileVault 2)-Instant on as you open the lid.-Time machine painless backups (and encrypted as well).-Bundled software (iPhoto, iMovie etc)-Cheap upgrades (OS X)-Backlit keyboard-Very secure OS.  Don't even need an antivirus if you use common sense.-No bloatware. Default install is clean, no propaganda slowing down or confusing you.-You can choose the language.-Only one OS.  No Starter vs Pro vs Ultimate nonsense.What I don't like:- The screen is OK but I think Apple could fit a slightly larger screen in the same space.  The metal frame around the screen is pretty thick.- Not a fan of shiny screens, prefer matte.- Kind of expensive.  For this price it could have at least longer warranty.Overall a great notebook.

I will try purchasing this machine in the next couple of years in hopes that I don't strike out again (I'm a sucker for a good product and I believe that Apple still can provide that).I imagine the issue I originally encountered, that I gave this product 1 star for, was simply a defect in manufacturing. I own an early 2011 MacBook Pro that I love. I am (was?) an avid Apple fan and I purchased the newest Air recently. I opened it up only to find that the screen was lopsided. The case seems to close with the left side coming down every so slightly sooner than the right, which makes the whole body of the computer lopsided. When the laptop is closed, you can see that one side is a fraction of a millimeter tighter than the other.As an academic and type-A person who spends a great deal of time on her machine, this is unacceptable. When I drop a grand on a piece of equipment, it had better be perfect. I didn't think Apple could disappoint, but it did. I (exchanged) this first computer and (opened) the next one in the store before leaving. Hopefully no one else encounters this problem and Amazon will allow your return if you do.Edit 6/25: The tech at the Apple store was incredulous at first, but when he saw the gap difference he willingly replaced it. My understanding is that I am not the only individual who encountered this. The replacement does not have the same issue; I now have an excellent computer to use for work and school and am pleased so far with how things are working. I'm not incredibly computer savvy, and this is the first Air I have owned, but for someone who needed something light, small, and fast, this fits the bill. Still annoyed (and very surprised) that the first go was a bust.Edit 7/13: The second computer, after a couple days of use, began to randomly go black. Nothing would be lost, nothing to indicate why this was happening. The screen would just go dark and I would have to wait five to ten seconds for it to turn back on and all would be like it was just before the screen went dark. Kind of like an old person nodding off while watching TV and then suddenly waking up. I did trouble shoot with Apple. No hot spots on, nothing amiss. I took it back to the store; they offered to replace it. Instead, I washed my hands of the new toy and decided to wait a while to see if this issue got resolved. I was so disappointed.Then, I saw the computer go on sale at amazon for the student discount price at apple, without tax, on the 10th of July. It felt too soon, but that was a great price. I had a nice chunk of change in points and gift cards with Amazon and thought- what the heck. I bought it again, thinking there was absolutely NO possible way I could experience an issue a THIRD time.Of course, the screen on this computer was lopsided as well, like the first one. Not as severe as the first computer, but bad enough that I sent it back to Amazon today.I give up, Apple. I want to love your newer products. I really, really do. But it seems like there are some serious quality control issues and bugs that need to be resolved, and I don't want to cope with those, despite my desire for a new computer (fortunately I don't necessarily need a new one right now). I hope my old pro will last me a couple more years. When it comes time to replace my pro, I'm not sure if I will look at Apple's products to replace it.", "Date": "June 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good", "Author": "ningda sun", "ReviewID": "R351XEFOCK6KUZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is new and in perfect condition.

I'm lucky to get 3 hours with the brightness turned down to 4 out of 16 blocks, and running only one app - Pages.  Anyone who spends this kind of money expecting the long battery life that Apple promises is going to be disappointed. Apple won't replace my lemon with a new Air. They want me to ship it to an Apple store so the techs can scratch it all up and then return it to me with, more than likely, the same problem still existing.No more Apple products for me. Bought two of the original iPads in 2011 that Apple now refuses to support (no more updates for the older iPads so we now get crashes that cannot be avoided, not to mention software we want that requires the iPad 2 or later). How long is Apple going to last by ripping off customers? Do they really think the average person can afford to spend $500 to $800 on a new iPad every two years?I bought a new iMac the same time I bought the Air. How long will it last? My Dell PC lasted from January 2003 to March 2013 - TEN YEARS with no problems whatsoever. I don't expect my iMac to last even half that amount of time. My brother warned me not to buy Crapples. Now I'm paying for it.No wonder the Macbook Air is now $200 cheaper than what I paid for it. Plus now they're giving their software away to help boost sales - Pages, Numbers and Keynote - all of which I had to buy separately right before this updated version came out.January 31, 2014 at 6:18 PM EST: Apple deleted another one of my posts which only asked people how long their battery life is on a full charge on the Macbook Air.

It is very expensive and has not drastically changed in the past few years.  However,  all our other home computers are Apple.  Thus, in looking for a new one we felt this was the way to go.  Our initial reason for buying an Apple over a PC was the dreadful experiences we had with on line support for our PCs as opposed to the pleasant service we got dealing with a damaged iPod that belonged to our daughter.  The prices are the same on line or at the Apple store so we chose to purchase at the Apple store.  We have heard friends in the past few years complain that the Apple service had gone downhill, but had not experienced it.  Thus, for these reasons we decided to purchase the product.  This product Was supposed to come with a gift card, which the cashier was supposed to activate.  The only way that we found this out was when we went online to use it.  After speaking with both online support and the store, there was no dispute that the card was supposed to be activated.  Apple's high-tech solution: take the time from your day to travel to the store to have them do what they should have done in the first place.  This is hardly the old type of apple service.  Rather, it reflects a company that continues to live on its past reputation.  Thus, when considering a lightweight computer in the future, I'm going to consider products from Samsung and others that are trying to accomplish what apple is squandering.

But if you are migrating over to Apple to take advantage of the apparent bargains to be found in the professional software arena (Music Production, Video Production, Graphic Arts, etc.) I am issuing a warning that Apple is lying to you.  Apple has implemented an aberrant pricing policy that varies widely from the industry standard pricing policy for professional software.  Apple, in true corporate fashion, has made this change without warning or notice.  The new policy is NO PATH TO UPGRADE.  You heard me right.  If you pay professional software prices for a piece of Apple software, and two months later they release the new and improved package, you will be stuck paying full price for the upgrade.  Do you feel like you got a deal now?  You have now paid more for your software than if you had gone with the industry leading software package (PreSONUS, Adobe Premiere, CorelDraw, etc.) and next update, you will be well behind the pricing curve.  I do not have a problem with Apple software, but rather the sneaky way in which they implemented the pricing policy.
