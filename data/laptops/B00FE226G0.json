I do a lot of photo processing and word processing.  The new touch pad is a deal killer.  Since they got rid of the right and left click buttons and combined them with the touch pad, it's very clunky and difficult to control when you click or when you don't.  If you just watch videos, maybe it's ok, but then you probably would want an iPad and not a full laptop.  Terrible.", "Date": "April 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not for professional use yet...  If you can wait to upgrade your Thinkpad, I would wait...", "Author": "Hermandog", "ReviewID": "R2UL0BVIWMDIZJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Just as a point of explanation, I purchased this machine for professional use.  I am a typical road warrior and have been for decades and I work in a tech field...  So this review is really written for those who might be considering purchasing this machine for professional use.  I have another device that I use for personal use and so while this machine comes with a bunch of \"apps\" that some might love, to me they are just bloatware...I waited a long time to \"upgrade\" my thinkpad (t44) even though it was time.  I waited much longer than normal primarily because of the change in keyboards (update to anyone who doesn't know - the old 7 row keyboard is gone forever, the trackpoint no longer has its own right and left \"mouse\" keys, and lots of other key are just combined or gone - like the backup key and the right click keyboard key)...  For me these changes really slow me down.  There has been a lot written about this keyboard change but Lenovo is not bringing back the old keyboard...  Other changes have not been written about much - the lights that show HDD activity and active network connection devices (wifi, bluetooth,etc.) are gone...  The Lenovo bloatware is completely out of control, encouraged no doubt by the win8 OS which jumps clumsily between wanting to be a tablet device and needing to be a professional PC...  Disconcertingly, out of the box, this Thinkpad identifies itself as a \"home automation\" device on the local network....  Clearly this is some configuration error on Lenovo's part, but no one has figured out how to resolve this yet...  (Others have reported this issue as well, and we are all waiting for some sort of response from Lenovo.)  The issue for me is this embedded \"home automation\" device seems to have its own network security settings which do not comply with the network security settings for the PC...  So basically, I have been spending my time trying to figure out how to deal with that (and no I am not the only one) rather than actually using this PC.  I hate to sound like a hater, but every new Thinkpad really just gets farther and farther away from a machine designed and built for professional use...  I think that this one might be my last Thinkpad as there is very little differentiation...", "Date": "May 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not what I expected", "Author": "shopper29", "ReviewID": "RYL9WRBP4CHVS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Had a Lenovo before & really liked it.
