The finger print feature wasn't working, the computer froze up, a bunch of issues happened to it. I was very disappointed in the product. And that purchase is still hurting me to this day.

The computer itself is very good and fast and I really like the fingerprint swipe in lieu of entering passwords.  The only things I don't like are: (i) I absolutely loathe Windows 8 so far, (ii) the battery length is not as long as advertised and (iii) the a/c adapter cord where it connects to the side of the computer refuses to stay put and falls out a lot.Updated: I've dropped this from 3 to 2 stars b/c the battery life after 5 months is pretty pathetic.  I fully charged it today and then unplugged and my battery estimate was just over an hour.  Also, this week, the fingerprint scanner just died out of the blue.  Still under warranty so presumably I'll get the latter (though so far the warranty process is less than straightforward).  In any event this isn't what I expected from HP.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "NOT 40% OFF", "Author": "scott hurlbert", "ReviewID": "R1TJN72JZRSBWH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Not exactly a 40% off deal. $891 X 40% = $534.60 NOT $609!!Would not believe the advertised savings.
