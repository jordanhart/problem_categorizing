With regards to 2012, max out the ram (16gb) I believe and it should do 90% of all current games. This thing is a monster for the price.AMD a8 is a 3rd generation processor. It is meant to compete with the intel i5; though many say its not as fast, a minute difference at best, realize one thing both are coupled with a videocard. AMD's is far superior; simply put amd is for gamers.Style wise, the pictures aren't great on the website so it feels like a gamble. If you want a good idea, youtube it, you should get this single video where in it the guy has random dumb images appear as he unpacks his laptop, this is it. Too lazy to do that, then imagine the red gateway laptop with the amd a6, just black with a metallic gray keyboard.The sound is pretty good, and the image quality is amazing, better than my lcd desktop monitor.With regards to the battery, it says it maxes out at 5 hours, But that's probably on a dark screen playing solitare. For movie watching or surfing on powersaver it should be around 3.5-4 hours.Material wise, its a solid laptop, its really solid plastic, with a metallic keyboard background to prevent things from intruding inside. I find it way better than the quality of my old dell.Style wise I love it, it has a geometric pattern on the black portion and the lid closed looks like other nv's when closed.If you still want more review on the laptop, look at the Acer Aspire V3-551-8469 15.6-Inch Laptop. It has 32 reviews, and is from what I find the exact same laptop, just acer branded, and 25$ more. Realize Acer bought Gateway in 2007, and gateway is a branch of it. I looked at the various pics and specs, even the touchpad is positioned like this model.Honestly if you want a solid sturdy laptop, to play games, watch movies and surf the web this laptop is a wet dream for the price of %420.Happy shopping :P", "Date": "January 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "perfect", "Author": "richard graves", "ReviewID": "R2H0EX6TGG0XJP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "runs great. new games play perfectly with no lag. i recommend this laptop to anyone who is looking for a good laptop at a great price", "Date": "April 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Power button and support failure", "Author": "Dawna Irish", "ReviewID": "R2S7KXHVK7Z1TL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Shortly after my year warranty was over, the power button failed.  Research online revealed this is a common problem.  Cannot phone Gateway tech support without paying for it.  Free to chat which was a joke.  Was told it was flat rate of $249 plus shipping to send in for repair.  Not.  Took to local repair which found a small piece of leverage plastic under the power button was broken.  They were unable to obtain replacement part through Gateway- told the part was not available.  They told me they could jimmy something to power on but the button cover would have to be off.  Support and parts are impossible from this company unless you pay as much or more than a new one.

The laptop barely looked like it had been used, so the seller must have taken good care of it, except that the right side of the laptop where you rest your arm is loose, but only just. I am an avid gamer, and as such, I needed a computer that could handle anything I throw at it. This laptop is amazing! The 1.9GHz AMD APU inside and the 4GB of RAM keeps the thing nippy and quick, the graphics card, an AMD Radeon HD 7640G, runs games smoother than melted butter. The seller was very nice to notify me when they couldn't ship the laptop due to a major winter storm in their area. I have had very few problems with this laptop. So far, my only annoyance with the laptop is the fact that the screen changes brightness according to what the majority of the background is colored when the laptop is unplugged. Other than that, Battery life is great, about 3-4 hours. Windows 8 was a big change coming from Windows 7 myself, but I got used to it, and I must say, it's much more efficient than Windows 7 for me! This laptop was definitely worth the $380 I payed for it!", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "After 1 year of use the laptop no longer powers up", "Author": "JGL", "ReviewID": "R3OJ45ITOMUIVM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I write reviews very carefully as I know it impacts the manufacturer, but there are times when consumers need to be warned.I purchased this Gateway NV52L15u a year ago and I targetted the purchase to see what lower cost laptops could provide. Unforuntately my experience with this Gateway has been bad from the start. When I first received the unit I could not get the wireless working. I had tried several steps to fix it like upgrading to the latest drivers and I was even advised over the phone to reinstall the operating system. At the end of it I had to ship the unit at my own expense and the issue was that it needed a BIOS update.After that was resolved I thought it would be smooth sailing, but then when Windows 8.1 launched the unit gave me problems with the upgrade.The final straw to all of this is that the power button has failed and of course right after the 1 year warranty expires. Like other reviewers this is my last Gateway that I will ever purchase.I have realized that by purchasing a lower cost laptop you get what you pay for. The plastics feel cheap, the touch pad is marginal, and like other reviews sound quality and the resolution for the display is bad.I thought I would be able to over look these things but for a machine to only last 1 year it is unacceptable.Buy another product you will thank yourself in the long run.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Computer incomplete", "Author": "Mauifish2121", "ReviewID": "R35113EFGSL7AY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "There was no Microsoft Office installed on this computer.

I sent it in under warranty and Gateway says since they saw residue from a spill  on the keyboard (which is true) but it was many months ago and amount was very small.

This is my second and last Gateway - Acer product, they always come up with an excuse not to honor the warranty when unit fails within warranty time period. Other unit the hard drive failed after just 3 months and they wanted me to pay for it. I did take laptop apart after they sent it back ( I figured for $270 I would rather buy a new laptop), and power supply failed, which looking on the web is not uncommon and if their techs looked at all it should have been obvious.

Considering that price, I love this laptop!It's had a few hiccups, but nothing that makes me angry about the purchase.The speakers are garbage. I think the sound card is too - even with decent headphones, it still sounds cruddy.It loves to attract dust. Whatever.The most notable thing is that (and I think this is a software issue) It keeps telling me that my folders are not usable. I have to go back to \"users > select > documents/pictures/etc\" to save and retrieve. That's annoying. Really annoying.All in all... it's a decent purchase.
