With a start and shut down button and no flying tiles the unit seems to work well. Still disappointed with MS, dropped a lot starting with the very good media center with junk in return. Downloaded VLC.The first thing I noticed about this unit was the keyboard, best I have ever used. Large responsive island keys with a light pewter colored border. I am downloading a ton of stuff with no freeze or hiccups so far. Had to install the latest Adobe flash. Good at multitasking, did a big heavy test run. Jump up for me from my dead Compaq 61 AMD dual core. Quite a difference from returned underpowered Asus. Uh oh, slight freeze on NBC replay of AGT. Great price on i3, even previous generation.", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Bad for a PC", "Author": "lotusgreen", "ReviewID": "R3BKG4QYFVJP76", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Okay -- I am at heart a Mac person. But Macs have priced themselves out of my market, or I have fallen below theirs. This is a whole lot of machine for the price; it is also a whole lot of openings for malware. This is a word you learn when you have a pc. On the other hand, it's fun to be able to interact with the internet speedily. I also like the wide screen.From my experience, most if not all telephone and online Microsoft support is frighteningly bad; their training seems to have been to make the customer calm and optimistic.... and then rip their hearts out.", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good except for Windows 8", "Author": "AC500Driver", "ReviewID": "RQRWOYP8X5Y4H", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Windows 8 sucks beyond what mere words can describe, but using Classic Shell at least make this computer usable.

So quickly I hit the returned item button and the seller turned it around midship with no questions asked. They were great, with excellent customer service and I would purchase from them again and again and plan to in the future when I replace my laptop.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your money.

This is so much slower then the two year old laptop I replaced with this. The mouse touchpad is so sensitive it goes to another page every time I try to use the touchpad. The only reason I gave it two stars and not one is you can only expect so much from a laptop in this price range.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "best ever", "Author": "keenan", "ReviewID": "R370W22626MSES", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "start fast and stay fast.
