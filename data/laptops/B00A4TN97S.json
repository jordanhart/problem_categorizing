I needed this laptop for internet, email, basic Office functionality (primarily Excel and Word, occasionally Ppt), Itunes music interface with ipod, and we needed the HDMI port so we could stream to our tv.  We made the mistake of ordering this system with Win 8 instead of 7.  I can't say how much better the system would've functioned with 7, but I know it is barely operable with Win 8. Both Microsoft and HP should be ashamed that their product created such a perfect storm of frustration and crappy functioning.WIn 8 sucks.  Everyone knows it.  Everyone but MS employees will readily say so.  So I'm not going to waste a ton of time detailing why it's an extremely bad idea to put an OS designed for a touch screen on a lap top that does not have a touch screen.Let's talk updates.  When I configured Win 8 I clicked the setting that Win 8 is NOT allowed to install any updates without asking me first. I do not like too much running in the background without my knowledge.  So what happens?  LIKE AN ABUSIVE BOYFRIEND, WIN 8 will ask if I want to update and soon after I say \"no\", not yet,  MY MOUSE POINTER MAGICALLY FREEZES AND FUNCTIONALITY SLOWS TO A CRAWL as my system has a seizure.  I once waited 1/2 an hour for this to remedy itself.  It did not. Several times, my indicator for Norton Internet Security suddenly goes away or shows up as being deactivated (WTF?).  I was forced to alt+ctrl+del and restart. During shutdown, Windows suddenly decides that it's ok to begin installing that update that I previously turned down.  HOW FRIGGING CONVENIENT!  This happens EVERY DAMN UPDATE!HP isn't innocent either.  The HP support assistant is supposed to be a friendly interface there to let you know of updates that are ready, fixes you need, even basic maintenance suggestions (like a recovery set).  And it would probably be lovely if the damn thing didn't a) choke up all application functioning once a week when its dialog box pops on the scene to let me know what's up (weekly notification, you can't set it for longer terms), b) takes a full minute to open, and c) crashes itself 50% of the time during updates.This machine doesn't like to go to sleep and frequently goes into a mini-coma when you try to wake it up.  And god help you if you close the laptop, change your mind, and immediately try to open it again.  The screen will be off and you're going to be there for at least another 10 minutes waiting for the system to fully turn itself off and go to sleep, and then you have to wake it from its mini coma (a feat in and of itself) before you can get any kind of functionality back.Software and applications on the system take an extremely long (and unacceptable) amount of time to open, they periodically freeze up, and frequently crash.  Thanks to Win 8 itself the OS is very resistant to change and pulls out all the stops to prevent you from properly using other vendors' applications. -However, once you manage to get those apps installed, they work so much better that what comes on this piece of junk (thank you to Itunes, Foxit, and Outlook in particular).The inherent applications put on here to open files (Windows Media player, Mail, Live, etc), take forever to open and frequently need massaging to work.  -Yes, I remedied this by putting on my own applications that work better, but it took forever because Win 8 doesn't want you to change a thing.  It took forever for me to even dig up the right files in Win explorer to take out the crap I didn't want (and there is so very much crap loaded on here).All of these problems were there from day 1.  They can't be blamed on viruses or incompatible/competing software or me screwing with it.  Day frigging 1.  I was the fool who thought all systems had their problems and I could find fixes for these.  It's been a year and just as I solve one issue, another one opens.  My spouse has a mac in the den and can't even stand to use this laptop for anything at all.OH, and whatever you do, don't use Norton Internet Security on this machine.  Even though that's the free trial you get with the system, it practically destroys functionality in and of itself.  If you set it to do anything at all on your system (even the least invasive), it becomes a massive resource hog and can often shut down functionality itself.So this laptop + Win 8 + Norton = A really bad time.  You're signing on for an abusive relationship and lots of disappointment.Why did I give 2 stars instead of 1.  Very simple:  A) the HDMI port works as advertised and actually does send images to my tv beautifully (when I can get my streaming working that is), and B) I can honestly say that because of my experiences with this system my standards have dropped so incredibly low that as soon as I get my new laptop (which won't be HP or Win 8) I am going to be delighted into ecstasy.", "Date": "May 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "My very first laptop...

The Skype App was already downloaded to my Windows 8.. But it was sooo difficult I couldn't use it. Wouldn't let me sign in or \"update\" it. So I had to download Skype to my Desktop.

The problem is there were no parts for my model any more.  So they REPLACED MY LAPTOP!  NO charge!  I could not be happier with HP customer service!I would still photograph all sides of any product I would send in the mail (with a current newspaper to show the date sent) just in case it gets broken outside of your control.THANKS HP!  (To repeat: I did not buy this particular item.)Original review:  BE FOREWARNED:  HP SERVICE / WARRANTY IS NOT RELIABLE!!!The story:  I have an HP laptop which I sent in for warranty checkup (fix some rubber screen bumpers, cleaning, fan noise, etc.)  On the way there or at HP, it got damaged, which they claim was my doing and wanted $128 to fix it!  They were nice saying that was a \u00bd price offer!  But THEY caused the damage to the laptop!?  The reps said, \"Do you have pictures of the laptop?\"  Ha!  So when I refused to pay and it was returned, it would not even turn on!  I had a professional engineer open it and he said it must have been violently dropped as the CPU had come unseated.  Also they cracked the hinge on one side, so I couldn't close the lid w/o snapping the screen off.  I wrote a letter to the head of marketing and his assistant called back.  He offered me a nominal amount to trade up to another new laptop.  I declined as it wasn't a reasonable offer.  So be forewarned:  IF you get an HP product, the repair dept. may break it and the company will NOT fix it.  They will blame you.  IF you do send it in for repair, take a dozen photos from every angle as you'd have some proof.  I'd take a picture of the box just before you send it as well.

The fan is not loud, but it is noticeable.  The keyboard is slippery and the mouse is too sensitive--but you'll get over these things.  Web browsing (any browser) is slower than my iMac and any of the PC's at school.  It's enough to get basic jobs done but the speed is frustratingly slow.
