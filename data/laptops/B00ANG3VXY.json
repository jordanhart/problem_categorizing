The return process was very easy and Amazon shipped the new one before I even had a chance to ship the one I had back.  Amazon customer service was very helpful.  The only reason I gave the item 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the price. It is an expensive computer but I'm very happy with it.  Great for gaming!", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00ANG3VXY"}}
