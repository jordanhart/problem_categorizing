{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Below Expectations", "Author": "James \"Albert James Ybarra\"", "ReviewID": "R2HDC6EPO8VVPM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this computer after having an HP laptop for over 7 years. I figured trying another brand out would be my best option but I was wrong. What attracted me to this laptop was 15.6 inch screen and the AMD elite quad-core. I'm a light gamer so seeing League of Legends run worse than my old computer, something had to be wrong. All-in-all, the laptop gets the job done as far as having a computer goes (since having a computer is better than not having one all together). It's below average as there are cheaper and better options out there. For the price, I expected something a little better but I learned the hard way. Everything seems to be ran below average on this computer. It fell flat for my expectations and I will use my experience for future purchases. This was a new model that came out in Feb-March 2014 so I had high hopes.", "Date": "May 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not up to par for gaming at all!", "Author": "T.

But other than that, I haven't been too upset with this computer. I dropped my phone from about 12 inches above it the first day I got it and it left a really large dent, so I'm thinking the materials used for the case are pretty cheap, but if it will be sitting on a desk 99% of the time.. it looks great. Not so great for someone who will be packing it around school.", "Date": "May 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Stopped Functioning Completely after just a month and a half of ownership!!!!", "Author": "Robert O'Donnell", "ReviewID": "REJ22V0JDJ9FQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've had this laptop for a month and a half. After minimal use, only for email and photos at this point, the thing stopped working completely.  It doesn't even power up.  I can't return it because the deadline passed a few weeks ago.  $600 for nothing!!! It is the worst product/ experience I've ever had with Amazon.  I took a gamble buying a laptop online, and it failed me. I don't care what positive experiences others have had with this product, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Very, very upset and disappointed.", "Date": "May 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "it is very difficult to connect net by wireless, and it`s no earphone mic, especially for home use", "Author": "Jinfang Li", "ReviewID": "R2D4AV7KZ77IV3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "it is very difficult to connect net by wireless, and it`s no earphone mic, especially for home use, I think this laptop is not use for home net.", "Date": "March 13, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$599.99", "Features": "AMD A10-5745M Processor\n8 GB DDR3\n1 TB 5400 rpm Hard Drive\n15.6-Inch Screen\nWindows 8", "Name": "Dell Inspiron i5535-2684sLV 15.6-Inch Laptop (AMD A10-5745M)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Clz92sYEL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00HU1JQ6G"}}
