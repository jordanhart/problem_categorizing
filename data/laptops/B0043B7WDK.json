I thought the design might look ugly just looking at the pictures, but the design is very nice.Anyways here are the pros and consPro: nice sleek design, comfortable keyboard, good performance, reasonable graphic card, cheap price (at least based on my price), light weight, and does not get very hotCons: lack of bluetooth (which i hardly use), lack of some ports such as memory card reader (which again I hardly use), sound quality is not very good, arrow keys kinda smooshed together with the rest of the keypads (not really a problem), lack of hoktkeys (which means you have to hold the \"fn\" button to control the volume and etc)I really think this is a decent laptop for decent price (unless they raise the price up). Even though there seems to be a lot of cons, i think those are really minor issues (at least for me) and the pros outweight the cons.

Typically I'm wary of any pc's that are in the local stores as they usually get the watered down versions of laptops where you can find the better, more advanced models online.While not on sale anymore, it was still relatively inexpensive compared to a lot of the other laptops that were no faster. icore5 2.4 GHZ processor, 4GB of memory, 500GB hard drive, 512 MB Nvidia video card, built-in SD memory card reader, DVD-burner...what's not to like!Also, while it's easy to overlook something as simple as keyboard layout...it was one of the bigger selling points for me in finding a new laptop. I used to have a powerbook titanium G4 which had a nice keyboard layout, and even now the mac book pros have in my opinion the best keyboard design available in any laptop. The q430's keyboard is quite similar, with the raised, solid, black keys that are responsive, spaced out nicely and provide nice feedback. So once I made the decision to go with a non-mac laptop, I was hoping I could find something comparable in the keyboard area. And the Samsung q430 I think is the closest you can get to having a mac book pro keyboard on a pc laptop. I love this keyboard perhaps with the exception of a smaller than usual shift key, I love it.If there was anything I would change about the laptop, perhaps it would be to not have a glossy screen as sometimes the reflection can be annoying. But nevertheless the screen is bright and strong when I need it to be and I notice it less and less.Wireless works great, 3 usb ports, decent built in webcam, fairly lightweight and has HDMI out! I have even dropped it once already, transport it a lot and everything seems to be going smoothly with no issues. For the price, and even price aside, I think you can't go wrong. I truly feel this is a solid laptop, especially when coming from the world of sturdy, apple quality laptops previously.It's a winner!-MikeL", "Date": "November 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing Product", "Author": "makk", "ReviewID": "R3JHQ370JOP3WB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been trying this laptop for two days now and I am very satisfied by it.The Good:1. Light for its size. I had a Dell XPS M1330 before and this feels lighter than that even though its a 14 incher !2. Fast processor. The turbo boost on its Core i5 really makes it snappy for everyday work and also for photo and video editing. The new Office 2010 runs smoothly on it.3. Looks expensive. The aluminium on its lid and around its keyboard give the product a distinct look.4. Graphics management. The intel HD and nVidia 310m graphics switch seamlessly according to the programs needs. Runs 1080p HD video (native and flash) smoothly without any hitch.5. The Keyboard is this laptop's strong point. Its chiclet style and good to type on.6. Heat management is great on this laptop. The CPU and graphics card temperature didn't exceed 65C even after several hours of (moderate) use. The outside also felt cool.The Bad:1. Touchpad could have been better. The scrolling seems incosistence. (I am not sure if  the touch pad or Windows 7 is to blame)2. The battery life could have been better. It is giving me 3.5-4hrs on a charge with moderate use.The Verdict:Its a steal. I was looking at the Envy 14 before this but with this laptop's price, features and looks, I am glad I got it.", "Date": "December 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "The Best in its Price range...Read to learn about solving issues regaring other reviews", "Author": "GC", "ReviewID": "R1SIN7FH3C3XGS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "READ TO LEARN ABOUT SOLVING ISSUES REGARDING THE PROBLEMS ON SOME REVIEWS.This laptop had all the necessary components you would need. The design, processor, and graphics are the best in its price range. Considering that I was able to buy it for $649 including the $100 Amazon promotional code. The Intel i5 IMO is the best processor since it balances battery life and performance unlike i3(lacks performance) and i7(short battery life). On the graphics, It can play most of the latest games at low-medium settings only. Design...just look at the pictures. Everything else are just average for a laptop (screen, spekers, etc.) The things that bothers me is the Wireless Card and the wrong description of Amazon about having a Fast-Start feature.Pros: Intel i5-460m, Nvidia 310m!!(laptops with dedicated graphics are worth $700+), Design (looks like a Mac)Cons and Solutions:*The Wireless Card is below average and as what some reviews says that it disconnects occasionally is actually true. It happened to me but I was able to solve that problem. To repair it update your driver by downloading it on wikidrivers not on samsung site*The Samsung Fast Start Feature is not available on this laptop. I tried downloading the software but it says that this laptop does not support it. Is there anyone who can confirm this?*Trackpad issues, not true. Mine work perfectly except for the two finger scrolling which is not important since there is a traditional scrolling at the side that works fine. Some reviews says that the mouse is too sensitive, that is  because the Momentum feature is turned on. Configure your mouse settings to remove undesired features.*Battery Life sucks! 2-3 hours of battery life on power saving mode. Wifi-on, Lowest brightness, and internet browsing. If you don't mind staying near a power outlet this laptop is fine for you.*Issues in streaming videos like youtube during full screen, don't use the update in samsung site. Search for Nvidia 310m driver 266.58, it will solve your problems. If your too lazy too search just look for the link in the comments.To sum it up, this laptop is worth $650-$750(considering specs and quality) based on my several months of researching and comparing. I'm telling you right now that I did the best way of knowing the worth of a laptop and this one is a really good deal if your budget is really tight. I even checked the prices during Black Friday but no deal matched the \"Specifications to price ratio\" of this laptop if it would remain at the $600-$650 range. I definitely recommend this laptop for Students with tight budget and desires average gaming capabilities. Btw, I owned this laptop since December 16 2010 and reliability test is still ongoing.", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "My Review for Samsung Notebook", "Author": "Sam C.", "ReviewID": "R1S2I8GH98SSD0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this yesterday while it was on lightening deal (699) with free 1 day shipping. And it arrived today at noon.I've bought and sold (on ebay) many laptops due to my gadget addiction. So I think I know a thing or two about laptops.For the people who are considering this. Things that I couldn't find it from other reviews.(i) it's pretty big. The picture on amazon makes it look like 13 in notebook at best. But when you actually take it out of the box, it's pretty large. I've owned laptops from 10in to 15in laptops before. By far, this 14 in (wide) is very nice. 13 in macbook was even small for me. And 4*3 15in laptop was just not right. So this is bigger than what the pictures make you think.(ii) Feel? Cover is blackish graphite aluminum and inside (palm rest too) is brushed aluminum. It's not too heavy (compared to macbook pro 15in, this feels lighter). This look elegant. Does this match up to Macbook pro? Probably not. I just don't like latest gen black keyboard macbook pros. Know that this samsung's bottom is plastic. Which I don't mind. If you have macbook pros, you know it's gonna get scratched up in a month. I like this computer.(iii) keyboard: I hate thinkpad keyboard (some maniacs love it but I just can't understand that. How can you like buttons that are stiff and require more strength to type on? I never went back to Thinkpad). I love dell keyboards (that of notebooks). They give you not to soft but spring response which makes typing easier. So if you know some of the keyboards, this Samsung is in between thinkpad (talking about feeling, not the way it's made) and dell. That should clarify the feeling.*Someone said in a review that these keyboards are rubbery and he likes it, but there is no rubbery feeling. This is as plastic as it gets. That review was kinda misleading to me.(iv) I used it one day. Battery came at 60% (charged), so it took about 1hr to reach 100%. And it took about 2hrs to run it down to 10%. It's not great of course. But these days, schools & hotels all provide multijacks so no problem.(v) cord; no one talks about this probably because they are not in the context of school. I'm doing my Doctoral next year. So length of powercord matters. It's not long. I've seen some wacky long ones to shortest (macbooks). This thing is about macbook (or pro)'s powercord. It's not long. And for students, you just need to get seats near the power outlet.(vi) screen. it's cover to cover glass. So it looks and feels nice. I never had screen like this. But this is better. It's like iphone without cover. Think that way. iphone in INCASE and bare iphone. If you know what I'm talking about. There is difference. Shade or cover around the screen (by incase) makes screen look different. This is a plus. Very nice. Resolution is not super (my eyes are used to iphone4 or super amoled of phones). Don't expect that from this. But it's standard.(vii) fast start (not cold boot, but from sleep to wake up; that's what samsung calls it); it's pretty fast. Definitely a plus.(viii) Sound; is pretty big. Just watching youtube but had to turn it down.(ix) fan noise; again something important for students who study in libraries. This thing makes audible fan noise when you install programs etc. But in normal MS word typing situation, it does not. So This unit won't make others mad in the library.*forgot to tell you about touchpad. it's small compare to macbooks. Actually tiny. But it's ok. This thing doesn't have Bluetooth. So I again have to pay for Nano receiver mouse or something.(x) The reason why I went Samsung this time for the first time was because Samsung makes memories and LCD/LEDs. Never owned Korean made laptops until now. Tired of Taiwan made. Sick of American made (I had multiple Dells and a HP. Don't know why I keep going back to Dell though it breaks down usually). Sorry. Time to go Korean. When Apple advertises that they make both hardware and software, it's misleading. They make body and assemble parts themselves. But you will find their harddisk is from toshiba. LCD from Samsung etc. This unit (just checked) has Toshiba hard, Atheros wireless. Both I hate. Both gave me failures before so I remember. This time the hard disk does not make as much as noise like old harddrives made by Toshiba. But you can still hear it. Wireless is so far so good. Don't know about memory and LCD. I have two LCD tvs. Samsung and Vizio. Someone said all LCDs are the same? No. It's not. That's why I wanted to try Samsung.*i5 vs i7. I have i7 XPS Dell desktop. I can't feel the difference. All these processors, to me, don't make much difference. I bet I am not feeling difference between XP/celeron and this premium one. So don't worry about i7 and how it's better for multitasking. Also I did 1080p youtube. It take time to load but once it's loaded, there is no hiccup like in netbooks.(xi) Windows 7 is a great OS. I've had everything from Linux, Jolicloud (same as Chrome OS; almost), Vista, XP, Apple OS X..this thing is not bad. Not bad. Start up time is fast around 20-30 sec. People; don't believe Apple never crash myth. Apple freezes all the time. Just go to mac store. \"genius\" appointment and see how many units they bring back to repair. If you are like some people (mac is blacktie, pc is jean), I have nothing to say. It's all about looks for some people. But you don't have to type on macbook pros to make it bestsellers. You know who are real deals? People who have macbook pro17. Most others just buy it just to try out or to feel better about themselves. (I went Mac after Vista; that thing is just a horror story isn't it. As hardware improves everything has to be faster. But somehow they make more memory consuming OS. So after 10 years, with i5 i7 processors,pc is still slow and lagging. Right? You don't feel much difference between your pc from 8 years ago and now; only thing you can feel is the hard disk size. That thing is a good. 500GB? Wow that's great. My first toshiba had 5gb hard disk) Remember, John Farve writes on a dell and became youngest speech writer for president.Nor I suggest you buy cheap pcs. You get what you pay for. I think this unit is reasonable. I probably will sell this after 1.5 years (that's how long I keep laptops). But so far, this is not bad as a pc. it's 699 now! What? After selling this as a 4hr lightening deal, amazon dropped the price down on all pcs since yesterday. If that were the case, I \"could\" have gone to 15.6 in samsung. But soon I have to travel to Orlando to study and I don't regret.This is a good buy. Buy it while it lasts (don't know about this seller, notice it's not amazon selling this now). Not bad.

So i was kinda bummed, then i clicked the similar items thingy on amazon, and saw this samsung for the same price i was going to pay for the asus, but a 14\" screen, i5 and 500gb hard drive, so slightly better specs for the same price. I own a samsung Galaxy s, and have been impressed with the quality, and also when i bought my last laptop, i was checking out a samsung next to it, and almost bought that then, but went with an asus last time because of a 2 year internationl warranty, so i remembered the feeling of quality when i was considering this one. So i checked out lots of reviews, called samsung and confirmed that this has an international warranty (although only 1 year vs. 2 year on asus) actually, they told me that all their technology products have an international warranty, and on the info sticker on the laptop it says international warranty as one of the marketing points, although its not mentioned here on amazon. (i travel a lot so its important to me)So what i can tell you guys is that is a really awesome laptop. The keyboard is a joy, really nice to type on, 100s of times better than the generic crap you find on your run of the mill dells etc. i love the seperation between the keys.my last laptop had and core 2 duo 9400 running at 2.4ghz, and this is defintely a bit snapier and faster. it has ddr3 type ram so im sure that helps.samsung manufacture their own lcds, and this screen is really nice and bright and clear. and it looks super sexy with its edge to edge glass, and makes it easy to clean when you get your retards coming up and poking your screen (what the hell is with people anyway?) i dont get paranoid that im going to damage the lcd, because its not the lcd directly that im rubbing with a cloth.im always plugged in really, so i cant comment on battery life, but samsung include a utilty to keep the max charge to 80% should u choose, which apparently increases battery life.some have complained about the touch pad, i guess when you compare it to the massive glass ones you get on an apple it is small, but its pretty average for a pc, and fine for me. it recoginses multi touch gestures, which isnt mentioned here either, and that is way cool too. scroll documents and the web with 2 finger swipes, browse your pics with 3 fingers, pinch to zoom, rotate. pretty cool stuff.the over all feel and apperance of the laptop is of real quality. it looks nice, it feels nice and it does everything with a nice speedy snappy feel. I ran the adobe cs5 suite all just to see how it rendered pics etc, and its smooth, fast, sexy baby!Also, just to see if it could, im playing left for dead 2 on it at max resolution, and some other settings at medium approx, and its smooth and fun and very playable. i plan to see if i can run call of duty black ops on it, im hopeful!Im really happy with the 14\" screen. its so much nicer than having a run of the mill 15.6\", its dainty, delicate, utilitarian. my last laptop was a 17\" beast, and when i put this in the 14\" bag i got, i feel all warm inside thinking how clever i am for getting such a portable pc, and it feels really light!So if you're wondering, i say buy it, you wont be sorry. as nike says, just do it!", "Date": "February 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent laptop for the price", "Author": "R.

I bought this laptop for $649 with $100 Amazon credit, which is awesome because we buy lot of stuff from Amazon, so AMZN Credit = Cash for us. First, I'll list the pros and cons and then explain them.Pros:Excellent PriceBuild qualityAwesome KeyboardFast ProcessorDiscrete Graphics with Optimus technologyCons:Cheap wireless cardScreen - poor viewing angleNo gigabitNo bluetoothSo so touchpadI'll start with the cons first. Although I never experienced any dropped connections, the wireless card on this machine is a cheap quality one, which doesn't give you the full 300Mbps wireless n speeds. It is limited at 150Mbps, and in reality, you get less than that. I tried various drivers. The screen looks great, but viewing angles are not so good. Particularly at vertical angles it looks really washed out. Ethernet, come on Samsung, even the cheaper laptops now a days are shipping with gigabit cards, which is very useful when you transfer large amount of data via network (this may not be a con to many). No in-built bluetooth, again a minor con. I bought IOGear BT dongle for $4.99 from Mwave, which works really well. Touch pad is not the best, its not horrible either, it just works. I prefer the bluetooth mouse.Now the Pros, the price is really slick for a sleek, i5-460M, NVidia 310m with Optimus, 14\" laptop. Regular price of $649 is really good, particularly if you don't have to pay tax and CA recycle fee. $100 Amazon credit makes it sweeter. Build quality is good, but the lower part feels plasticy. Island style Keyboard is really nice (like a mac), keys are placed spaciously and very quiet. The best part is the NVidia graphics with Optimus technology, which allows you to control which graphics to use (Intel HD/NVidia). You can set it to auto, or configure on application basis. I am not a gamer, so I cannot comment on gaming performance. I ran 1080p videos and they played very smoothly. I can see the performance boost in Photoshop compared to my old Core2Duo machine. i5 processor is fast, and I removed all the junk Samsung included except Easy Display Manager (although less bloatware compared to other brands) to make it really snappy. After the initial setup, there were 70+ processes running and after removing all the unnecessary things, I have about 50 processes running. I removed McAfee and installed Norton (not the best, but much better than McAfee, and uses less resources compared to other AV products).If you are on a budget and want to get the best available machine in 600s (including taxes & CA eWaste fee), this is the one.

Also to note, this is the Q430, which is not exactly like the Q410 sold at Best Buy.  The ports are in all different places and the Q430 doesn't have the \"scoop\" that raises the palm rest like the one at Best Buy. It also has a 500GB hard drive as opposed to the 640 GB in the Q410 at BB.  Other than that, it's the same thing.  And the Q410 one is $150 more.The GoodI love the size of this laptop. It's small and light and just perfect for your lap while sitting on the couch. 14 inches seems to be the perfect compromise between the larger 15.6\" laptops (which add weight and unnecessary numberpad which throws off the centering of the keyboard) and the smaller 11 and 13 inchers which sacrifice screen real estate for the lighter weight.The screen is bright and crisp, no complaints.  Boot time is very good, especially coming back from sleep.  The look of the laptop is great, nice and sleek and well designed aesthetically. The brushed aluminum gives it a solid feel and a professional, stylish look.They keyboard layout is perfect for me, the keys have a nice tactile feel to them and seem to be spread out just right.  I wish the keyboard were backlit, but that's not a negative.The IffyBattery life is not awesome.  I seem to get about 3-4 hours of \"active\" use out of it, like having Firefox open with about 15 tabs, a word processor open, and maybe a couple other apps running (other than what running in the system tray).  I'd be interested if Samsung offered and extended life battery for the Q430.I rarely use the mouse trackpad, so I can't really comment on it other than it seems to work normally for me.  Who can stand using those things anyway? So...... slow.....  I just use the Logitech VX Nano Cordless Laser Mouse for Notebooks anyway wherever I am.  So much faster and easier to use than the touchpad.I wish it had a backlit keyboard, bluetooth, and a blu-ray drive, but that's why this laptop is as inexpensive as it is.

I did a ton of research and not many other laptops come even close in build quality as well as specs.Pros:-Build Quality- beautiful aluminum case around laptop, sturdy feel to it.-Glass to glass LED screen- Looks very nice-Specs: Core i5, 500GB hard drive and discrete graphics card for under 700-KEYBOARD!!!!! Samsung's keyboard is the most similar to a macbook's keyboard(which I love) that you can find on a windows laptop.-Two fingure Scrolling using trackpad!(I know its small but it works alot more consistently then the previous scroll on my previous laptop who dedicated the right column of the trackpad.Cons-Takes more than thirty minutes for Samsung to install their junk software after going through inital setup (which was pure torture because as soon as it was done installing all the crap, I did a fresh install using a friend's CD). Although this is my first laptop in over three years so I am not sure if this happens in other laptops too.-Sound Quality is mediocre at best. Underperformed compared to the rest of the laptop but isn't horrible.-Trackpad is a wee bit small. Still comfortable to use compared to my old trackpad but features like pinch to zoom is pretty much unusable at this point.-Outlet Cable connecting to the power adapter is very shortOverall thoughts: While my primary choice was going to be a Macbook for College, Macbook's are a little expensive and they use outdated processors and technology in their laptops.

I haven't had a chance to evaluate the battery life yet.On the downside, the touchpad is ultra-sensitive and I sometimes unintentionally launch a program or activate a web link. I suspect it will just take a little getting used to. I could not get the Samsung recovery utility to work so I just burned a recovery disc using the standard Windows 7 utility. And the standard Windows Startup program list was very cluttered so reboot speed was annoying slow until I removed some of the stuff I didn't want.All-in-all, a very competent laptop with an appealing design at an entry level price point for an Intel i5 4Mb unit.

Doesnt get hot - unlike some laptops where the heat causes CPU fan to be so noisy you cant hear anything else.Stops charging battery when battery is high rather than charging to 100% all the time - so battery lasts longer rather than some previous laptops that seemed to not hold charge after few months.Dont like:More a personal preference - but didnt particularly want the built-in webcam.

Gabai", "ReviewID": "R4Z4I2WUN035M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this laptop on a great deal...just $510 inc shipping. I've had it for a couple of weeks and have been very happy with it. I have not found any glaring negatives yet. I shall update this review on a later date - once I get to know my laptop better.SO FAR HERE IS WHAT I LIKE:1. Construction. It feels more like a high-end laptop than a budget laptop. Keep in mind that I have owned Sony Vaio's from the S and SZ series. It is slim, compact, simple and sexy. All in a 2.1kg package. Yes there are lighter laptops out there, with built-in dvd drive and a gpu. But none close to this price. The aluminum looks sharp and should enhance the aesthetic and practical life of the laptop. i.e. no plastic parts to crack or discolor.2. Operation. Its is quick and snappy. It is really silent and remains really cool. I don't know how they do it. I've only watched some full length films. No games or anything like that. And the laptop remained really quiet and cool. The HP DM3 I owned before, just on being on standby would turn real noisy and hot.3. WiFi. Well, I have hear of people having problems with the stock WiFi card that comes with this laptop. I haven't had any such problems.4. Keyboard. It is a delight to type in. Very nice mate finish. Nicely spaced. Very nice feedback.5. LCD. The LCD is 14\". It is bright and really easy to use. No complaints there.6. Functionality. I really like the added features found in this laptop. They really add to its usability and are very practical like the battery life extender. A setting which ensures the battery is charged only to 80% capacity - so as to ensure maximum battery life - ie. holds a maximum amount of charge for the longest time possible.7. The touchpad. It is a joy to use. It is not in MacBook territory. But it is darn good. Multi-touch gestures work just fine. Some people complain about a lack of sensitivity. I have not found that. It did take me a few days to get used to the touchpad and find its sweet spots - but you quickly get a hang of it. And its quite good.I DISLIKE:1. Well, the black aluminum lid, whilst not as bad as them glossy back lids, can get quite easily smudges from handling. Quite unexpected, since I've had a couple other laptops with aluminum lids that did not have this problem. But this is minor. And is the only negative I have found so far.I HAVE NOT:1. Used it extensively on battery. So can't comment on battery life. On one occasion I was on WiFi and streaming video, whilst on battery power, at 60% I had over 2hrs left. So that is good. Still haven't tested it properly.2. I haven't played any games. So I can't really comment on the GPU performance.THINGS I WOULD'VE LIKED:1. I guess a backlit keyboard would've been a nice touch.All in all, so far, I highly recommend this laptop. And for the price - couldn't be happier with my purchase. BTW, in case you're wondering, my unit is a refurb. There seems to be some stigma regarding refurbs. As a matter of fact, 3 of my last 4 laptops have been refurbs. The only one that I had problems with, was the non/refurb one (a Sony Vaio SZ). The refurbs have never failed me, due to their own fault.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great laptop for the price", "Author": "Peter Vanecek", "ReviewID": "REMCXAXD8098F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just wanted to let everyone know about that great deal that Amazon Warehouse Deals was offering. I purchased this laptop (the Samsung Q430) off of Amazon about a month ago. It was selling for $899, but they also had a 'used' price for $529. When I added it to my cart, it took me to Amazon Warehouse Deals which is an area of Amazon that sells open box items.The laptop came in great shape (the box had been opened, but was tested) and when I called Samsung the manufacturers warranty was still valid. This is on top of the 1 year open box warranty that Amazon offers on all open box purchases. I normally wouldn't purchase aftermarket warranties, but at only $45 extra and there was no guarantee that the manufacturers warranty would still be in effect, I thought it prudent to purchase.Anyway, great looking laptop, clean lines and comes with windows 7.

It's sleek, stylish, runs fast, and runs quiet. I would have loved to give it a 5 out of 5, but there are two main issues I am having problems with.1) The battery life is not good. I am running things on low CPU, dim light, shut down background processes, and am running a HIGH time of 2 hours. Not good enough. Thankfully I don't use the battery power as much as a normal user, but it's still annoying for when I do. The battery software included designed to make it run longer isn't helping either.2) Just some strange things with certain keys. Having to press the space bar key 2 or 3 times to get a space. A lot of the keyboard shortcuts in various programs not working. I found a strange way to runaround this issue, and that's by pressing the \"Escape\" key twice, then keyboard shortcuts will work. But this will only last until I move to a new program where they won't work anymore. Back to the \"Escape\" key...strange.I'm not even sure if these problems would be for everyone, or just me. As it is, it's sort of frustrating, but the overall experience is worth it, in my opinion, for a great computer.

Stevens \"Laura Liz\"", "ReviewID": "R2UYFD9FGGSKKG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research before ultimately buying the Samsung just over a month ago. I read a ton of reviews before purchasing so I thought I would come back and write my own review. Some of the things I was looking for: sturdy machine that doesn't break easy, keyboard & machine that was comfortable & quiet, small screen, portable, powerful processor, plenty of memory, good sound & LCD screen for movie watching, sleek & modern design, good battery life, Price under $800. This laptop fits all of those criteria perfectly. I was looking at the Toshiba portege, Sony Vaio & Dell XPS15. While those machines all had a good feature or two, they were lacking in one or two areas that were important. The VAIO had very poor sound, it was much flimsier in terms of breaking or cracking because of the plastic frame, it had a good keyboard and look that I liked, but slower processor & very weak battery life for similar price. The Dell had great sound, same processor, but I have had bad experiences with Dells in the past & the look & feel is clunky to me. When I went into the store and tried it out I ruled it out right away. In the end it was between the Portege & the Samsung. The portege was a bit smaller at 13\", but just the overall design, the key close together, the processor made a loud noise & I had a lot of friends who didn't recommend Toshiba. Initially, I was reluctant to buy a Samsung given that they have not been in this market for a really long time like some of the other companies out there & I didn't know much about their reputation. But in the end I decided to take a chance on the brand because of the size, sleek design, processor, & memory. I have been extremely pleased with this machine.Pros: absolutely love the keyboard...it is like a MAC. On my dell I am always typing the wrong letter because they are so close together. The keys have a small space between and do not make a really loud clicking sound. The i5 processor is very fast for me. I transferred a large amount of files from another computer to the Samsung. They took 10 minutes to load onto the memory stick from my other computer & just a few minutes to transfer from the stick onto this machine. I can have lots of things running & no issues with processing. It is compact and easily portable, but is extremely sturdy at the same time. I fell asleep watching a movie on my bed and it fell off my bed onto hard wood floors. It landed with ease and no scratches, dents or chips. Just a very solid machine, but still compact. Sound quality is good for a computer. It isn't stereo sound like the XPS15, but it is still good as laptops come (unlike the Sony VAIO). Has the USB ports, & I happen to like the cover for it. I am not a huge gamer so the graphics card was not that important to me & I can't speak to the quality of that. A few reviews that I read mentioned the mouse track pad being touchy. When I first got it out of the box it was touchy, but I played around with settings & now it works perfect. Battery life is excellent. The web cam is great & easy to use.Cons: Honestly there are very few cons to this machine. The LED screen has that glossy finish so you will get finger prints. Check out Cnet to find out how to clean it & you'll be good on that. At first I didn't think I would like the cover on the Ports, but I haven't had any issues with it so far & like it now because when I'm not using them they are not visible. No bluetooth or Blue-Ray, but I didn't care about answering my phone through the computer & the Blue-Ray wasn't important to me.If you're looking for a good, sturdy, compact machine with a lot of features & great processor & memory, this machine is an excellent pick.

When I saw it, it was on sale for $650 and I could not pass it up. Although the product is no longer on sale, with its specs and performance at the current price you are still getting a good deal. The Intel core i-5 processor is plenty fast for my schooling needs, and the turbo boost technology allows me to maximize battery life while still getting the power I need when multi-tasking. The 500GB hard drive is enough to store anything I need on it as well as store my music and movies that I need on an everyday basis. Although this computer has a dedicated graphics card, which is usually only for your higher-grade, more expensive laptops, I feel that it could be much better. For example, the use of Windows Aero is not near as visually striking as on my desktop. This could also be because the video output quality is only 720p as opposed to 1080p full HD. As far as the design, I could not have asked for anything more. The brushed aluminum finish gives it a sleek look while also making the casing more durable. Samsung came up with some really efficient pre-made optimization and battery-life modes that help your computer run at its best for whatever the needs may be. The battery-life, at the highest energy-saving mode, is approximately 4 hours give or take depending on my level of multi-tasking. The keyboard is probably my favorite part. It has a Chiclet-style keyboard that is very easy to type on. The keys are spaced out evenly and they require just the right amount of force to push the keys, making typing on this machine much more fluent feeling than on other notebooks. As far as bad things go, just like all notebooks, the Samsung q430 has its share of turn-offs. For example, the edge-to -edge glass display, while looking very sharp and attractive, gives off the worst glare I have ever experienced. I can always see my reflection in the screen if I look right. Also, the wireless card and speakers could be better. When trying to connect to a wireless connection, it is imperative that you have a moderately good connection or else it will frequently drop the connection faster than you have the chance to use it. As far as the speakers go, they are not very loud and they already show signs of being blown by cracking and popping occasionally when the volume is turned up barely over halfway.

The Dell was a fingerprint magnet.  Fine, if you happen to carry around a bottle of Windex and roll of paper towels, which I don't.  I love this computer, and I defy anyone to find a better all-around 14-inch computer for a better price point.  After weeks of searching, I finally made up my mind, but had one reservation.  The specs (at the time, 12/5) stated that it had a built-in bluetooth, but a user review said it didn't.  So I contacted Samsung and they assured me that it did have bluetooth.  Ordered the computer, got it right away from Amazon and guess what...no bluetooth.  Called customer support and spoke with three reps who, although they tried to be helpful, could not give me a definitive answer about the bluetooth.  So, at their suggestion, I shipped the unit to their service department.  A week later the unit was returned with no explanation or correspondence.  I call Samsung and they tell me that they only checked the unit out, and it's operating perfectly.  I already knew that!  So, I call Samsung \"Tier 2\" support, speak to a nice rep who confirms that the unit does not come with built-in bluetooth as advertised, but suggests that I speak with the executive support level and perhaps I would receive a credit or some type of compensation.  So, I spoke with \"Michele\" who, as cold as ice, straight out tells me that specifications are subject to change without notice and there is nothing that Samsung will do to help me out, even though the specs on 12/5 stated bluetooth and I ordered the computer the next day.  She answered my requests with \"any further questions?\" over and over again. I know this is a little long winded but I had to get this off my chest and relate this unfortunate experience with others.  I'm definitely keeping the computer, and after being forced to buy an external USB bluetooth, praying that I don't require any further customer support.  One more thing, the English syntax that is used on Samsung's pathetic website and printed literature reminds me of the instructions that come with a cheap Asian product, instead of a high quality item, e.g. \"Safety Instruction,\" instead of \"Safety Instructions\" on one of the pamphlets that come with the machine.", "Date": "December 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing laptop for the $...", "Author": "Jonathan Lisak \"UFGatorGuy20\"", "ReviewID": "RR5E29BMSXXDX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:- Very fast Intel Core i5 configuration- 4GB memory- Dedicated NVidia graphics card (512MB)- Brilliant LED Screen- Awesome design (similar to a macbook pro)- Great speakers- HDMI out!Cons:- Lengthy initial configuration (so what... it's over with!)- Average trackpadI'm so impressed with the package I received for only $650.

I can even do light-medium gaming / photo / video on this if I wish.I've seen a few negatives aspects from others:1) Washed out colors, over-bright screen, etc. WRONG. Do you morons just keep settings on your tv at factory-out-of-the-box configurations? Go into the Intel graphics and media control panel and adjust the settings. It's a brilliant screen with accurate colors. Up the contrast, reduce the gamma, and reduce the brightness and you'll be amazed.2) Slow wireless card. WRONG. Stop blaming a computer manufacturer for your ISP errors. Call your ISP. My web browsing has been flawless.3) Messy trackpad. The trackpad can be a little tricky. But, it's not frustrating. I just pick up my finger and start moving again anytime it sticks.", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not Bad Not Good!", "Author": "S.

Nice finish and the camera is not bad at all for its class.No cheap plastics or loud mouse clicks.Cons:If you hate smearing your laptop with fingerprints you should not buy it. I have tons of fingerprints on it now. The keyboard has not been thought out well. The ordering of CTRL and FN keys is messed up. They are in the same order on the left side of the keyboard as on the right said of the keyboard. The keyboard keys feel like cheap cheap plasticThe heating duct is completely misplaced and initially the laptop heats up a lot. The touchpad is a tidy bit small.

Other pros are the keyboard layout, it is well laid & spaced out. The heat management is amazing. For a quad core, it runs so cool, that I could not believe it. The fan runs very rarely and definitely not when browsing.Cons are that the keyboard is not backlit and it has no bluetooth, but I knew that before buying it. All in all, a great laptop for a very reasonable price. I got it in one of them deals at Amazon.com with the $100 credit so am really happy.

I love how fast it is and the graphics are amazing.. those of you that play flight sim x it can run it on ultra high with only a few shudders here and there!However.. there are three reasons why i gave it 4 and not a complete 5 stars. 1) the webcam could be of better quality.. it works just as good as the one that came with the family computer we bought in 2001 :p .. 2)the cd drive is REALLY flimsy and cheap.. whenever i open it i feel like im going to break it, but i guess thats what you get with such a thin computer.. and 3) the base of the computer is all metal.. but the silver bezel around the glass screen (which is amazing by the way) and the material around the keys is plastic and kinda brings the computer down in terms of looks when you see all glass and metal and then a plastic bezel -____- .. but i can live with it.. all in all i highly reccomend this computer you will not regret it take it from someone whos owned this for almost 3 months!", "Date": "January 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "REAL happy", "Author": "cleverusername", "ReviewID": "R3HYEF4EJ2A836", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this laptop after a lot of research.
