It had the best specs for the price and I'm extremely satisfied by it. I don't feel like a bought a cheap product. The style of it is decent enough not really fancy or cheap though pretty much all plastic. Performance matches what it should and runs any current game perfectly fine (BF3, Guild wars 2, Skyrim, Call of duty)Speakers seem to be very loud, probably louder than my alienware was.Keyboard is a hit or miss, It is smaller because of the added number pad which some people might love and some might not like. I get mixed up hitting things by the number pad on accident but I have to say overall after getting used to it the number pad is great to have. Trackpad seems to work fine, I don't use it much thoughScreen is the 1366x768 res which I was fine with, I mean I would prefer the higher resolution but I haven't come accross any time where I miss the pixels really, I would rather use the money towards something else like an SSD.Software wise there really wasn't much crapware at all thankfully, most of lenovo's software seems to be useful and not interfering.Battery life seems like to be around 3 hours which isn't to off for a gaming laptop, optimus helps keep it cool too. Weighs a bit over 5lbs and its really not that bad, its comfortable on my lap during normal surfing.The device never really seems to feel to hot, the vent area is right above the WASD keys which you can feel a bit but not much. According to HWmonitor my temps have reached 90C though when I was playing guild wars 2, though I didn't notice and it didn't slow though it does seem a bit hot, it idles in the high 40's though which is cool enough.Don't regret getting it one bit though, i've had no real issues at all.", "Date": "November 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great!!!", "Author": "Cameron", "ReviewID": "R22CDR9CFSPY6G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So, i just got this about 2 days ago, and so far, all is looking well! I'm gonna try to go in-depth for those of on on the fence.Windows 8: Was my biggest concern because of the new interfaceA really neat guide to Windows 8 ---> [...]Actually really cool. Main thing most people worry about is the new interface and no desktop menu. But I found out that it does indeed have a desktop menu that looks just like Windows Vista/XP/7. It's actually an \"app?\" on the start menu that opens up a desktop that resembles the interface we all know and love. The taskbar is there, you can still create app shortcuts, there's a recycling bin, everything except the start menu, which you switch to by moving the mouse into the lower left corner and clicking. So, basically, it's still the same desktop from Vista/XP/7 with a start menu that has its own page. And if you put the mouse into the upper or lower right hand corner, it has your system settings, system search bar (formerly the \"Run as\" search box), devices, etc. Everything is nice and smooth. Actually really good, better than I expected.Normal Day use: Great all around, could be a replacement desktopNot much to say, it delivers what you need and more. You'll be set for a while.Battery: Not greatIt is a gaming laptop after all, so battery isn't so reliable. Great if it's gonna be used around your house. Don't expect it to be too portable.Exterior: GoodLike how it looks and feels. Touchpad is nice and responsive. Not really any complaints.Gaming: The fun yet tragic part of this laptopOk, read the WHOLE thing. There's a good and bad part. So the bad part of this laptop is the super spectacular GeForce GTX 660M graphics card. Well, it's a hit or miss really. Some people have had it work out really well, can run ALL the new games too. Unfortunately, many people like me have a glitch in the Nvidia card where it causes artifacts or distortion of the games, ANY game, lags them up, freezes them, crashes them, etc. It's a hardware problem, so there's no current fix for it. Just about everyone is getting a replacement, and most replacements work the first time. Now the good part! It comes with a Intel HD 4000 graphics card as well, which is supposed to be for the regular use stuff, BUT it's actually really good, at least for me. I can play Borderlands 2 with textures and graphics on high and everything else turned down PERFECTLY! No lag, freezes, etc whatsoever. And even better, I can play Far Cry 3 with all setting turned down except for water reflection PERFECTLY! I emphasize PERFECTLY because its delivering far better than it's supposed to, since it's considered crap, at least by Nvidia. So, even the lowly Intel graphics card can pack a punch in this machine. No doubt the turbo boosted quad-core CPU and 6 GB RAM help tremendously. I did order a replacement to see if I can get it fixed, but, to be honest,  I don't really need it. I got this to play current and old games I couldn't before, so I'm set. I'm willing to bet the Intel can go a little farther too before becoming obsolete. So, if you're only expecting to play a few current generation games, you can't go wrong.Verdict: 4/5This is one super charged beast that can put some desktops to shame! It's gaming abilities is second to none (if you can get it to work, that is) and completely destroys the restrictions put in place by it being a laptop. It's quad cores and turbo boosted GPU will no doubt deliver years of powerful performance, and it's RAM (boostable to 16, not 8) will make sure that you are able to play any game you want, no matter how much of a RAM hog it is (*ahem Minecraft). But the hit or miss performance of the Nvidia card has you basically flipping a coin on if it is a lemon or a rocket. Even still though, I am thoroughly impressed with it's performance!Edit 1/11/13Alright, so I managed to fix the graphical problem with the Nvidia crad by underclocking it's memory clock. Everything runs great now, and I'm proud to say gaming doubts aren't a problem anymore. But, it runs hot. REALLY hot. After playing Far Cry 3 for about 25 minutes, the game started to lag a little and I noticed that the heat coming from the exhaust thing was hotter than I ever felt while using the Intel card. So, a cooling pad is a must if you plan on gaming. It's weird though, because it wasn't that hot after I played Battlefield Bad Company 2 for about an hour. So, bewarned about its heat.", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing Laptop", "Author": "Irakli Pruidze \"sellfish.me\"", "ReviewID": "R2Y7CABG0ZCKVX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's the best for that price, great performance , great display, keyboard, it's too good for gaming, every game on ultra graphics with good fps, except Max Payne) no problem is heating while gaming, but not in winter, without cooler it will be 'k, but in summer u should buy good cooling pad.

It's a real deal breaker.  Gee, this amazing graphics card will play some great games!! Singleplayer.  Or LAN'ed over hard ethernet.  This isn't as much of a \"lap\" top after all.  Perhaps I should tote around an external USB wifi?Now I question whether this wifi issue wasn't simply exacerbated by 8.1, and was always there to begin with.  In fact my original review was already wary of wifi issues and I said (on factory Win8.0) that wifi was \"slow to connect\".  What's more annoying is it doesn't play well with other computers on a network.  Often (even \"normally\")when one connects after the Ideapad, there seem to be issues, killing the local machines connection, but sometimes even causing the ROUTER to grind to a halt.  This makes you a wifi terrorist which I'm sure anyone will realize is NOT cool.. given it's normally friends/family you're terrorizing, or potentially worse, those you're working with.Now it may be that I have one of those amazing government rootkits attacking my machine (check out Flame or \"BadBIOS\" if you wanna feel paranoid), which has been there presumably from day one, OR that for the second time, Lenovo is offering up a very tantalizing deal which makes you PUCKER 1 year later from the distinct lemon flavor. ****the previous Y series I owned completely imploded in simultaneous mouse, keyboard, and screen issues, which eventually killed the PSU.I got a warranty this time.  I just couldn't turn down the power/price of this machine.  But do I look forward to shipping off my primary piece of technology to lenovo so they can hem and haw over it and tell me everythings fine, or that the issue is with Intel drivers or Microsoft?  I'd probably rather buy windows 7 (yes an intentional and welcome downgrade) for $100 because this allegedly fixes some of the driver issues.  Worth a shot right?!?Buyer be VERY watchful of any wifi abnormalities and immediately make a ton of noise about it and send it back.  Perhaps I was  just an unlucky hopeful functional PC owner.  However, other than that, this is a mean piece of hardware for everything from digital music to graphics editing and beyond.  Keyboard is GOOD though not as good as the prior Y, speakers are GOOD, durability is FINE, battery life is GOOD, heat output at load is OK, overall power is EXCELLENT, and I often use the numberpad on the side.  Its a compelling feature set, so perhaps its still worth the TENTATIVE risk of wifi issues.To combat this problem, I have rolled back drivers as far as I could find.  This worked a BIT which took me from the complete-nonfunction bracket to generally dysfunctional.  Then, I have written an executable batch file to reset the wifi drivers (which I sometimes execute 5 times in a row) to resolve this problem every time it springs up.  Once it starts though, it's like a weed.  Here's the code:@echo onipconfig /releaseCMD /C netsh interface set interface \"Wi-Fi\" DISABLEDipconfig /flushdnstimeout /t 2netsh interface set interface \"Wi-Fi\" ENABLED... This often will eventually resolve the issue for at least ONE page load, which is nice.  Doing it manually would take 20 times longer.  Hope it helps anyone with a similar issueIf you want to game on this computer it's highly recommended you uninstall Lenovo's proprietary battery management software, which does an awful-at-best job anyway.

I was unable to resolve the problems described below & ended up buying a Lenovo Y500 (I'm not a Lenovo devotee; the value/price/performance is right for me). 18 years of repairing computers (HP, Dell, IBM/Lenovo, Sony, Toshiba, Gateway/e-Machines, Samsung) has taught me that no manufacturer (most & least reliable I've encountered were both IBM laptops) makes a great (I'm talking long term reliability, not \"on paper\" specs) machine every time, so I buy the best value that meets my current needs regardless of the OEM.Things to consider when evaluating a Lenovo Y580:-Y580 has the higher performance GeForce GTX660 vs Y500's GeForce 650 but most Y500's have (Ultrabay) dual/SLI video cards included-Y500 is actually a newer model than the Y580 (same form factor)-looks like the entire \"Y\" series from Lenovo only include 5400RPM (no 7200RPM) HDD's-Y500 has \"Ultrabay\" allowing swapping of the extra GPU with a fan, optical drive, 2nd HDD (cursory search can't find any for sale though)-1366x768 res or 1920x1080 (uncommon for a 15.6\" screen laptop)-Blu-Ray or DVD options (couldn't find any Y500's with any optical drive)-white (Y580) or red (Y500) keyboard backlightingI'm relating my experience primarily to inform people of the \"solution\" (read the last paragraph) Lenovo presented to me to \"fix\" my Y580. I believe this is potentially a solid value in a gaming laptop as long as you don't have to deal with their tech support.The machine worked fine during normal computing but problems appeared when I started trying to play games requiring 3D acceleration. I believe it was continuing to use the integrated graphics card & wasn't auto-switching (should be seamless) to the nVidia GPU as it should have. I tried Borderlands 2, Saints Row the Third, Dungeon Defenders, Left 4 Dead (1). Since I don't see reports of similar problems from others (Amazon & other sites with reviews), I suspect I got an isolated defective machine.Problems I encountered with ALL the games I tried: flickering \"sparks\", 5-60+ second pauses (not frame rate drops), freezes (switching to task manager & back would sometimes unfreeze the game), unexpected game close with: \"graphics card has stopped responding & recovered\", Win8 equivalent of BSOD's (a sad face).I used the convenient one button \"restore\" feature (to restore Win8 to factory condition) twice while self troubleshooting (so I KNOW the software was Lenovo standard) before calling Lenovo for help.After some moderately helpful (professional, friendly; acknowledged that there was a problem & that I'd need higher level tech support) but ultimately fruitless troubleshooting, I was referred (had to dial another number; no direct/warm transfer) up the tech support path to someone who after more fruitless help blamed the problem on the fact that I was trying to run games.He told me that, since it was a software problem, I'd need to call another number. He was confident that they'd be able to solve my problem in under an hour by changing some settings in Windows & it would only cost $60 an hour to fix my machine so that I'd be able to play games on my new gaming laptop. Paying $60/hour (it may have been $59 or $59.99) is unacceptable to make a gaming laptop capable of playing games. The Y580 met all my requirements (1080 res, Blu-Ray, gaming GPU; I compromised the 17\" screen) so I would have exchanged it but the seller was out & discontinuing the Y580.", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "jonathan", "ReviewID": "R102DVM3N5O5FN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "its a monter im playing hitman blood money on ultra specs as well as deus ex human revolution and crysis 2. all of these i couldnt play on my older pc toshiba e205. great cuality and built in", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very happy with Lenovo Y580 I purchased 9/24/12", "Author": "Donald J.

As soon as I got it, I wiped it to get rid of Windows 8, put Windows 7 Ultimate on it instead, and it's been running like a champ. I use my computers pretty hard, and this thing has taken everything I've thrown at it from 3D design and rendering to video games to dual-screen multitasking and 1080p video. It has plenty of ports, a high resolution screen, and even pretty awesome speakers for a laptop.All that being said, I have a couple of minor complaints that aren't even enough to warrant deducting a star from the rating:The little LEDs that signify power, battery, caps lock, num lock, etc, are TINY and horribly placed (all the way at the front edge of the case); they're pretty much worthless for glancing at to see what's going on. But who cares. You'll know your caps lock or num lock are on/off as soon as you start typing. Also, I do have the common, numb keys problem other people have described, but it's not that bad. It seems to be worst on the bottom row of keys, specifically \"C\" and \"M,\" but you just have to hit them a little harder. Not a big deal. Finally, I'm really sad that they sacrificed storage space for hard drive speed. Mine shipped with a 1TB, 5400RPM drive. I really wish they would have opted for a smaller, 7200RPM drive, but that's just preference and it's something that's easy to change out.Overall, I'm incredibly happy with this purchase.

Everything works satisfactorily until 4 months later. The laptop wouldn't boot and the error message points at a hard disk drive failure.Request #1: A quick and pleasant call to Lenovo and, two days later, I receive a replacement drive and reinstallation DVDs. The hard drive is used, below the specification of my previous drive... and started to fail noisily in the middle of the reinstallation procedure!Request #2: Calling Lenovo and asking for another drive, which I receive promptly. I install the drive (used parts and below specs again), turn the laptop on and... What's that horrible whining sound?! Conclusion: Yet another failed disk. And to be sure of my diagnostic, I extract an old drive from an old laptop. I successfully reinstall my Lenovo laptop and the old drive.Request #3: Calling Lenovo again. They want me to return the laptop. I make sure they understand the nature of the problem, why returning the laptop makes little sense and why I expect a drive with, at least, the same specifications as the one I originally bought. A week later, the promised drive wasn't there yet (and actually never arrived).Request #4: On the phone with Lenovo... They don't know what happened to the previous drive. They'll send a new one, with the right specifications. I didn't bother opening the drive when I received it, it wasn't the right kind!!! In the meantime, tired of waiting, I had bought a new drive at a local store. Unsurprisingly, it did wonder in my laptop.Request #5: Moving online to avoid being impolite on the phone. There, I go through a weird registration and realized all the limit of their support tools. I almost feel sad for the support people working there. I try my best to describe all the extent of my issues with Lenovo. The field limit to 150 characters don't help, at all. My request: A real solution, in the form of a real drive or a real check to cover the purchase of a new real drive. And, a couple of days later, I receive... an empty box?? After some head-scratching, I understand they want me to return my laptop... #FacePalm!!!
