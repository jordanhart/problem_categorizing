The video is excellent and runs most popular games. Sony has really made these machines to turn heads. Heads will turn anywhere as a result of this bold white interior. The audio great. Overall a great white super machine by Sony. I strongly recommend.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Shelby", "ReviewID": "RGFK7KLO1W41B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't know too terribly much about computers, but I haven't had any problems with mine yet. I LOVE that it has a number pad on the side, and the keyboard is very easy to type on. The track pad is textured, which I really like. The webcam is quite nice, and has good resolution.The only downside that I have found is that the track pad is off center, so sometimes my hand bumps into it while I'm typing, and it messes me up. But honestly, it is a small price to pay for all of the features that I like about it.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great laptop for basic computing", "Author": "Jennifer Ziegler", "ReviewID": "R1KNG2TC867CAL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop from CircuitCity.com for $499 -- it is an excellent value for the specs, and it had everything I was looking for in a laptop.  I wanted it to be easy to travel with, have a webcam to Skype with my family when I travel for work, and have enough RAM and harddrive space to run multiple programs and save basic documents for home and work computing.  I like Windows 7 and the Sony Viao options so far.  The one surprise was it's not just white -- the wristrest area is glittery which makes it look rather girly, and that isn't really shown in the photos or descriptions online.  I'm just glad I bought it for me and not my husband otherwise it would have been getting returned.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sony used to last longer than a year?", "Author": "koldflow \"kel_zo\"", "ReviewID": "REPSNUHYH1YVK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This computer lasted just over a year and a half.  There is a problem with powering on which could be anything; I won't buy anything Sony again.

Repair guy says about $480 for one plus labor. This now glorfied paper weight almost never left the house.  No spills on it, no power surges, no kids pounding the keys.
