{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not bad at all, But...", "Author": "TheUnboxingGeek-com \"Bryan\"", "ReviewID": "R2X4VYPYPBCJDI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Dell Inspiron 15 i15RV-953BLK is a 15-inch notebook that provides great esthetics in addition to a strong build quality. It is designed for all users, novice and advanced, and is reasonably priced compared to other notebooks in its class.The Inspiron 15 is a quiet but powerful notebook with a sleek appearance and clean design. The screen is vibrant and large for viewing media, with speakers loud enough to fill a room. The Intel Pentium 2127U dual-core processor makes it speedy enough for standard usage and makes it a suitable replacement for a desktop. Its 4 GB of RAM help it keep up with the pricier competition.Build and DesignThe newer Inspiron model provides a sleeker more modern look than older models. It features a hinge design with the screen located in front of the chassis. This allows the user to move the screen closer to the keyboard making the action seem closer. The exterior of the 15R model is very elegant with its screen cover having a brushed metal appearance which gives the look of metal but the flair of a painted surface. The outer surface is actually easier to clean this way. This same design is displayed inside the notebook, on the hand rest and the trim around the keyboard.The shell is built with around a strong chassis with thick, durable plastic. The chassis resists bending and the hand rest and keyboard are supportive, remaining intact under strong pressure. Unlike previous models, the 15R is able to resist screen wiggling back-and-forth or side-to-side. This is largely due to the fact that hinges on each side keep the screen into a firmly locked position, only moving once lifted or closed.Upgrading the hardware is simpler than ever. To perform memory upgrades, there is only one panel on the bottom of the machine. The access panel can be lifted by removing the screw with a Phillips head screwdriver. Accessing the hard drive, however, still requires disassembly of the entire chassis.Display and SpeakersThe screen is 15.6 inches in size, with 1366x768 resolution. It should be noted that the screen's surface is highly reflective for those who prefer matte finishes. The LED screen provides a strong backlight with vivid colors that are optimal if the screen remains in a position within 20 degrees vertically of its standard 90 degree position. Horizontally, the screen can be rotated close to 60 degrees before the reflective surface disrupts the image.The Inspiron's speakers are situated along the edge of the hand rest and operate efficiently when placed on hard, non-porous surfaces. The speaker location could prove to be detrimental, however, if using the notebook on a soft surface such as a couch, bed or lap due to the fact that the speakers could easily be blocked.Ports and FeaturesThe Inspiron 15 offers many connection ports, providing the capability of hosting various media as a desktop replacement notebook. It features two USB 2.0 ports, two USB 3.0 ports, standard audio jacks, an eSATA/USB connection, HDMI, and Ethernet port. It also features an SD card reader and the available Wi-Di adapter allows the user to stream media from the Internet to an outside device.Keyboard and TouchpadThe keyboard features keys that are standard on Dell laptops. They keys are mostly flat with the letters and number pad being slightly concave in the centers. The design is wide enough to feel spacious even with the number pad, yet compact enough to fit all keys in one distinct rectangular space.The notebook features a Synaptics touchpad with a smooth gliding surface that supports multiple sensations at once. The touchpad buttons click softly with little noise.PerformanceThe Intel Pentium 2127U processor with HD graphics can manage any basic activities needed from an inexpensive notebook. While more than suitable for everyday tasks such as web browsing or creating documents, the included graphics processor is not built for hardcore gaming. It is still acceptable for other types of media such as photos or videos.High-definition 720p and 1080p movies can be rendered without lagging or skipping. This benefit comes in handy when using the Intel Wi-Di adapter which is perfect for wirelessly streaming HD videos to an outside TV.Battery LifeThe notebook comes with a 48Wh 6-cell battery. The battery tests in at a 3 hour and 33 minute duration. To extend operating time an additional 9-cell 90WH battery is available.Heat and NoiseThe Inspiron 15 manages heat distribution fairly well, with its only hot spot exceeding 90 degrees under the bottom of the chassis. Temperatures above the chassis stay below 90 degrees Fahrenheit. The laptop's fan steps in to reduce excess heat when needed. The notebook is quiet with minimal noise disturbance.What I like about it?Modern designFast enough for the average userQuiet when clicking or when fan is in useResistant build and durable chassisMultiple ports with multimedia capabilitiesWhat I dislikeProcessor not suitable for faster programs and gamesBattery life could be longerRecommended UserThe Dell Inspiron 15 i15RV-953BLK is ideal for those who need a simple machine that is reliable enough to handle everyday tasks quickly. The sleek design is preferred for users who are concerned with appearance and desire a cleaner, simpler look. For parents with young kids or students who share living space, the lack of noise is an advantage as well. The strong body is helpful for people who have to carry the notebook from place to place multiple times a day.Why should you buy it?The Inspiron 15 offers the durability of a desktop in a portable design. The included Intel Pentium processor fares better than that of many competitors or other Dell machines. It features around the same amount of RAM as more costly notebooks in its class and offers ample storage space. Considering it can be used as a desktop replacement, it comes in at an average weight. All in all, it is a reasonably affordable notebook with more than enough power for users who need only the basics.---------------------------------------------Update 24/10/2013---------------------------------------------------------------So far I am satisfy with this laptop but I found it's really heavy and bulky to bring it to anywhere. This laptop most probably suit to act as a desktop replacement, but mobile enough to act as a backup if you really need a laptop to work elsewhere once in a while.If you are a mobile user or student, I would not recommend you use this as your primary laptop. My two cents.BTW, I also notice that this buyer has shot some close up high def photos which helpful for you to have more idea about it's size and built and design.[...]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great buy", "Author": "Jennifer", "ReviewID": "R3N3YO69PLJ6X0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this computer.

Too slow and too clunky, she said.At this point I am tempted to digress into the many quirks of Windows 8(like the font spontaneously changing in Outlook or printer availabilty being app dependent) but, nevermind, you can Google these yourselves.A important feature of the hardware is that it does not have a touchscreen; a primary target of Windows 8. So many of the vaunted features of this release are lost on this device.Unless I missed something, this computer arrived with no CD and virtually no documentation. There was a folded, single sheet, quick start user guide which basically says plug in, turn on, follow instructions.Having said that, I have no complaints about the hardware apart for the lack of documentation. It does come up quickly and provides a crisp display for all applications.This computer has been plugged in for about a month yet I noticed that the battery was a little over half charged. After wading through a few menus I discovered this is intentional so as not to tax the NiCad batteries and can be disabled. Maybe they forgot to send me all the documentation.The final twist to this: before I deposited the old Dell to the electronic reycling heap, I decided to clean it up with a program called Defender Pro(available on Amazon for $4). The performance improvement is amazing. In fact, if I had done this first, I might not have bought the Inspiron.", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT Buy for Your Money!", "Author": "Marie Adams", "ReviewID": "R1ZT7X0Q6X4FTT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent system with great features...user friendly....high technology...efficient and proficient...Allows for great navigation, updates, and help system that is accessible and very informative and allows you to go to the web for assistance and download much needed up days to keep your computer operating at its' best always.", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good laptop", "Author": "Alejandro", "ReviewID": "RA3S3FS6SS3OP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is all what I need.

Search the internet for Inspiron 15 dropping wireless signal and you'll see that this an issue experienced by many. The rest of the machine is okay. I'd give it 3/5 stars. But given this wireless card problem and the length of time I've spent with tech support so far, I wish I could give it a 0/5 stars. It wouldn't be a problem if Dell would admit there's an issue but they're very resistant to do so.Mine has had issues dropping the wireless signal since I bought it. Because it is an intermittent problem, you will get a lot of resistance from tech support.Over the course of 3-4 months, multiple calls and chat sessions with tech support, I've been instructed to update the drivers, they've updated the drivers, they fussed with settings, rebootings, BIOS updates, and they came to the conclusion that it was my router (despite telling them no other device I have has had problems). AT&T; replaced the router even though they found no issue with it. Not ten minutes after the AT&T; tech left, my computer dropped the signal.Today Dell finally decided to replace the wireless card. Yes, it took nearly the length of the software warranty for them to finally decide that there is indeed an issue!If you already have this machine and finally reached the point where Dell decides to replace the card, ask them to replace it with a different type. They seem to be okay with this. I'll come back and update this if they try and give me the same type of card and/or if the new card hasn't fixed this.As for the rest of the machine:The mouse is a little inaccurate. You have to focus tap-to-clicks on the far left of the mouse or else it won't pick it up as a tap. It's annoying.The battery life leaves something to be desired. I get 2-3 hours with the power usage being almost at it's minimum.The rest of the machine is fine for what it is. This is a low end laptop so it's no hard core gaming computer.As far as Windows 8 goes:Windows 8 can be tolerable with the start button modification. Windows 8 is widely known as a giant flop but if you're like me and use computers for work and can't limp your Windows 7 machine any longer, you'll have to learn to put up with it. That's a problem with Microsoft though and not the machine.My biggest complaint is the wireless card and how long it has taken for Dell to admit mine is faulty despite the fact that many, many customers are having the same problem. Prior to this, I had always been pleased with Dell computers and their support. My experience with this machine and with Windows 8 has me pricing Apple computers. The amount of wages I've lost because of time spent on this an unable to work is much more than what an Apple would have cost.", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "i like it", "Author": "jason", "ReviewID": "R2CI92WRA01P2V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just what I needed.

There is a barely helpful Quick Start guide but otherwise refers you to the internet for assistance (which I couldn't figure out how to get).Also, it seems as though I have to almost bang on the touch pad and the Enter key in order for the laptop to respond.I don't really care for the waffle patterned surface, both inside and out, of the laptop.", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love the laptop", "Author": "Betty Ramey", "ReviewID": "RDKGQAPLW7820", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the price I paid, it is a great laptop.
