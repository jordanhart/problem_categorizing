I just simply love it.  The last time I checked, this same PC is not available on Lenovo.com, but the older third generation i3 is there for the same $800 that BB now has this fourth gen i5 going for, so before you buy on Lenovo.com, make sure you're getting the latest.By far the lightest PC I've ever had, it's easy to carry around, though it might be more of a challenge finding a case to your liking that fits it.  I bought a Case Logic one on Amazon, and it said it was for 12\" PCs, but it doesn't fit.  I sent that back today.I've heard of problems with the hinge, and I'm hoping that they resolved that before they started putting out this generation of the machine.  So far, so good.  It is quite powerful for its size, with 4GB RAM and the i5 Haswell under the hood.  If I could make one change to it, though, I would put a 1080p screen on it, instead of the 1366x768 screen it comes with.  The image is good, and the light sensor does a decent job of dimming the screen in low light.Some people don't like the idea of the keys being exposed when in tablet mode, but it doesn't make any difference to me.  I wouldn't have imagined using it much in either the tent mode or the stand mode, but my wife had back surgery last week, so isn't going downstairs to the man cave, so we've put it in tent mode on the coffee table in the living room to watch movies on Netflix the past few days.  One complaint about Netflix on it, it keeps switching between 16x10 and 16x9 on the screen, but I doubt that is anything to do with the PC, more likely the Windows 8 app for Netflix, because I have not seen the same issue with website-based movies and TV shows on CBS.com.I've found that if I'm sitting and using the tablet, it's handy to put it in my lap in stand mode, where it tilts up and I don't have to hold it up at an angle that I like.Basically this is a great little machine, and will definitely meet all my needs.  Like I said, the only thing I'd change is the screen resolution, but since I'm going from a 15.6\" laptop with the same resolution as this 11.6\" screen, I'm not going to miss anything.  Just one of those nice to have features.Definitely recommended, but compare prices between Amazon and Best Buy before you make your purchase.  Oh - and I say that as a person who absolutely hates Best Buy.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Everything I needed", "Author": "USCGsnipe", "ReviewID": "R1R4Z67XCX2UAY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent laptop. I was a lifelong Dell consumer, but dissatisfied with their customer service I chose to switch it up. After a lot of research and discussions with tech savvy friends, I settled on Lenovo.I was specifically looking for a small laptop. The screen size is perfect for me and I do not have problems watching any videos or movies. I use this computer for school, small business development, android programming and a variety of other uses. Between my external hard drive and cloud storage, I have not needed to store many things on my laptop which is great.Strengths of this Laptop1. The battery life is way above an beyond anything that I have experienced from a laptop. It easily lasts me 4-6 hours while using it heavily. It amazes me every day.2. It is very sleek, small and lightweight.3. It looks great.4. I have not had a single software or hardware issue with this computer over the 4 months that I have owned it.5. The battery manager is great and does its job.6. The convertible feature is nice and something that I actually use.7. The touchscreen is very accurate and responsive.8. Has 2 USB ports, 1 HDMI port, I headset/mic port and of course the charging port. I am impressed with the amount of ports on such a small device.9. This laptop spends most of its life in my backpack, being removed and replaced several times throughout the day. I obviously try not to damage it but it has survived the infamous falls and kicks and such that go along with being in a backpack. It still works and operates as new. I have also accidentally stepped on it. Thank God this is a quality product.Weaknesses of this Laptop1. The track pad/mouse pad can get \"touchy\" sometimes. It is more of an annoyance than an actual problem. Whenever it does this, I use the touch screen. So I guess it is not that big of a deal.2. It is a little flexible, which I initially was concerned about. I thought that it may be \"flimsy\". Some may feel that way so I throw it in this section. I think its flexibility is kind of a positive.ConclusionExcellent product that is of high quality and does EVERYTHING that it is advertised to do. I would highly recommend this product and am now a Lenovo fan. I cannot even think of a product that is as impressive as this one. Especially in this price range. I did save money buy getting it as Best Buy as opposed to Amazon. If you are looking for a small, yet powerful and efficient laptop...the buck stops here.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great performing convertible tablet/laptop", "Author": "Robert A. Schmidt", "ReviewID": "R2ILSHF4YCKWLW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this at Best Buy the other day for $750 ($806 after tax) so I can't really recommend buying this on Amazon unless they price match.  I wanted a replacement for my Lenovo Twist that I bought last November, which disappointed me with it's poor battery life, loud fan, and fairly high amounts of heat.  It was also a bit bulky, though on paper its only slightly bigger than the Yoga 11.I had trouble finding a Haswell powered 11S and the Yoga 2 Pro - while extremely appealing with that insanely high resolution screen - was just a bit too expensive.  I ended up buying an older Yoga 11 (RT Tegra 3) and was certainly pleased with the battery life and form factor though the performance was lacking.  A week later I was able to find one at Best Buy, though I wish they offered it in Clementine/Orange color.  I've been messing around with both quite a bit since then.  The Yoga 11 (RT) seems to be doing better in performance especially in regards to web browsing - I assume this is due to it storing files from the sites I frequent.  It works well in most cases and the battery life is really amazing.  I have been comparing it a lot to the Yoga 11S I purchased, which has a very long battery life (at least 2-3x my Twist).The screen on both laptops is pretty much identical, I am not a visual junkie so aside from the 11S maybe being a smidge brighter, I can't tell any difference at all; though it wouldn't surprise me if they were in fact the exact same display panel.  That said, I really wish the 11S came with at least a 1600x900 or a 1920x1080 display.  I think that would make it just about perfect.  It's a great display as is, however it does have a fair bit of glare and reflection.The Haswell processor also offers a much needed boost in battery life.  I wouldn't say I was disappointed in the performance, but the 4210Y i5 offers substantially less power than the 3317u i5 in my Twist - but the added battery life more than makes up for this.  It is still much zippier than the Tegra 3 powered RT tablet and offers the benefit of running full Windows 8.  It's also much cooler running, I barely notice the heat from the tablet and even though the fan is often running it is much quieter than the Twist's fan and has a more subdued hum to it.  I ran a PCMark 8 battery life test under the creative settings and got about 4 hours 45 minutes with the screen brightness turned up most of the way, WiFi on and Bluetooth off.  This was on Balanced power settings.  I've used it on \"Power Saver\" settings and it gets closed to 7 hours though performance seems to take an additional hit.  Battery life could be better, but it's so much better than the Twist I can't really complain.The keyboard on the 11S is actually slightly different than the older 11RT.  In fact if you hold them side by side you can see the base of the 11S is slightly thicker, I think Lenovo says .07inches thicker.  It's not noticeable unless you hold them side by side and even then it doesn't make too much of a difference.  I would assume this is to give a little extra room for the fan, although the keyboard keys do not have as much give on the 11S either and that is a little bit annoying.  The X key is already sort of stuck down or at least the spring has lost most of its rebound on my 11S and given that the keyboard already has slightly less give than the 11 RT it bothers me.  Aside from that they keyboard is excellent, I'm glad that Lenovo swapped the left Control and Function key from how it was on the Twist.  The soft touch palmrests on the 11S and 11 RT is also slightly different.  The 11 (RT) doesn't seem to attract sweat prints from your palms as much and neither does the track pad.  It looks cheaper than the metal grained finish on the 11S but I think it works better.  One last complaint - and this is for both the 11S and 11 RT - the track pad seems to work fine but the mouse buttons are integrated into the trackpad, meaning you push the trackpad down to click - and the 11 RT has a bad habit of not always pressing the correct one (left/right click) while the 11S doesn't do a very good job of registering clicks at all.If I were to change the 11S lineup, I would offer a cheaper Bay Trail powered version with 64GB of storage and keep the 720p screen.  It'd be a great buy at $600 because the build quality of the Yoga is superb.  I would change the i5 powered version to a 1080p screen and keep the price around $800-$900.  Aside from that I can't really find too much to complain about.  It's a great buy, battery life is good but not great, build quality is great except for the trackpad and keyboard issue on the 11S.  Processor offers an excellent level of performance while allowing this form factor to stay cool and relatively quiet.  I have already recommended these tablets to all my friends as I feel it offers the best compromise of any convertible out there.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good specs, good size, poor quality, horrible customer service - would not recommend.", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R39OZ1HE3HS9L2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was very excited when I finally decided, after much research, to go with this computer.  I made my purchase from Best Buy.  I got the computer home and I had an issue with the screen where I could see what seemed to be the touch interface behind the screen.  It was very distracting and since I didn't recall seeing it on the display model at the store I figured something was wrong and exchanged it for another one.I got the new one home and overall the quality of this second unit felt better and the issue with the screen was way less noticeable but still noticeable under certain lighting/brightness conditions.Everything was going great and I was enjoying the computer until all of a sudden one day, about a month after I purchased it, I started noticing really apparent image retention along the perimeter of the screen.  After only a couple of minutes of having an image on the screen, be it a browser window, or a PDF, the image would remain on the screen for 5-10 minutes after the window was closed or minimized.I called tech support and one of the technicians logged in to my machine remotely.  He was pretty persistent on insisting that it was most likely a software issue despite the fact that he could not see the image retention on his remote display and despite the fact the the image retention was not evident in screen captures.He updated the graphics driver which actually made the display way better but did not resolve the issue.I was told that my only option for them to honor the warranty was for me to send them the computer for diagnosis and repair which would mean that I would be without the computer for 2-3 weeks.  I told him that this was not a viable option for me because I need the computer for school which is why I purchased it in the first place.After several phone calls and a week and a half's time I finally got the case escalated to a supervisor who approved an onsite repair by a technician at the location of my choice.I was happy to have this option and took them up on the offer.The tech came to my house and replaced the screen but within doing so, mangled the bezel around the screen and put many deep scratches into the top of the machine with whatever tool he was using to detach and reattach the screen.  I really don't blame the tech because he was trying his best to fix it but now I have a new computer that looks like it was thrown down a flight of stairs.On top of the cosmetic damage, the new LCD panel is not adhering to the housing and there are large gaps between the panel and the housing.  It looks like the screen is going to fall off.I spoke to tech support again and they said that it will take them 2-3 weeks to decide whether or not they will send me a replacement.I just want what I paid for, and I believe I am entitled to that.  I have done nothing wrong and don't deserve to have my time wasted by these roundabout methods to what should be a very obvious and satisfactory solution:  Replace the machine.It seems like the only mistake I made was choosing Lenovo.

Chien", "ReviewID": "ROH91DVLCJNNC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "+ Very nice modern cellphone like display - touchscreen, clarity, contrast, viewing angles, etc. IPS.+ Very sturdy hinges and easy to fold into tablet mode and back.+ Light for the tablet+keyboard combo. Not as light as a 'tablet-only' PC, but the benefit of both worlds makes it a dream to use across all uses. Fast swiping viewing photos and surfing the net in tablet mode, editing spreadsheets and typing fast in notebook mode.+ Fast boot from SDD - 10 seconds or so.+ i5 CPU+ Thin and comfortable form factor. Good button placement, easy to access ports and SD card slot, etc.+ Nice, thin, light-touch keyboard. Better than my noisy Lenovo Z580's clacking noisy keyboard.- Only 128GB SSD to start. You'll have to replace with a 256-400GB+ SSD for $130-240+ later on for more storage space, or add a 64GB+ SD card.- WiFi under Win8 is unusual. Doesn't connect to a Netgear router from AT&T; even though all the 5+ laptops and phones in the house not running Win8 do perfectly fine at first. Had to enter the MAC address manually to bypass the MAC address filter block (even though the setting for this is OFF/DISABLED!!) - yes, wierd because at the same time, two new phones could connect using only the router password and did not need MAC address to be entered into the router!?! WTH, Win8!!!  (Yes, I'm a decades IT tech support guy, so it's definitely one of those odd Win8 vs router bugs going on here...)  Haven't pinned it down to the router, Win8 or Wifi Card, but figure as long as the minor change above fixed it all, moving along with life.- If you flip it in/out of tablet mode and quickly touch the screen or keyboard at the same time, it can 'confuse' it. eg. You've flipped it into tablet mode, but the keyboard still works or the virtual keyboard doesn't open.  One of those sensor vs. OS timing interactions, so easy way around this? Flip it to one mode or another without touching the keyboard, wait 1 second, and all will be fine. Doesn't always occur, but it does enough that you can start figuring out what causes this.- No CD/DVD drive. Sigh. Even though 7mm thick DVD drives are around (eg. Toshiba R series had them), etc, none here. Thus, extra external DVD drive to carry around. (Pioneer XD04 Bluray burner is a great pick)- Screen resolution isn't 1600x900 or 1920x1080 high. Even a Nook HD+ displays text crisper and nicer, especially asian characters that have fine details.- Only two USB ports, only one is a USB 3.0. No VGA port. No Ethernet port. Here's problem - has more than enough edge space to fit in more ports, but they go cheap and leave them all out. Even leave out the microphone port and has only one headphone (multifunction) port that only accepts 'special' microphones for recording.You can compare reviews at notebookcheck and other places for benchmarks.Yoga 11s is basically, at the five hundred refurb'd I got it for, one of the best examples of a high-quality Win8 tablet/laptop out today. Across the slew of available devices at this price range, nothing else touches it for the speed, performance, power, screen, weight and features that this has. The touchscreen is Galaxy responsive, and nice to the point where you automatically start swiping older notebooks and kick yourself after learning how to multitask input methods on the Yoga - type using the keyboard, touch selections on the screen, pinch zoom photos, mouse over to fine selections, right-click to pop open things, etc. Honestly, you start to wonder why everything else isn't built the same way =DNot quite so full-featured (CPU speed and HDD space) that it can instantly replace another, more powerful recent i5/i7 notebook, but for everyone else running something 2-3+ years old, it'll kick that old notebook to the curb quickly.Vs. a 2009 Macbook 5,1, it's light cutting 2lbs off the weight, adding a touchscreen (why on earth Macs still don't have a touch screen is beyond me!), rocket file launch and boot from the SSD, and a nicer form (not cold body). Kicks the Mac to the curb as well.For Win8, it's modern cellphone responsive when it comes to apps, store, etc, so it's everything the designers imagined a desktop OS turned touchscreen should be. Very happy with this, even from a wait one or two years before upgrading, SP1 or SP2 Win3.1 through Win7 power user. One of those systems where you start to pine away for the Yoga when you're not using it!", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Yoga 11s, decent haswell refresh, if only the battery matched the specs.", "Author": "Kyle \"cylem\"", "ReviewID": "R5J2YBK1GP27G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So when the Yoga 11s came out, everyone said it was a shame that it didn't come with haswell. Now we have a refresh with just that, an i5-4210y low powered haswell processor.Design: The yoga 11s is a great mini ultrabook, it's fairly thin, fairly powerful and portable. Opening it up, the keyboard is the first minor disappointment, it has a very dull look and isn't backlit like a lot of the newer ultrabooks. It's not a huge deal but it's something to note. Also something to note that is interesting is the SD card slot, the card goes in all the way flush with the laptop itself. If you aren't satisfied with the storage space you can stick a large SD card in there and use it for expansion without ever having to worry about it falling out.The screen is next, it is still at 1366x768 and while i don't mind that much on a smaller screen, plenty of them has 1080p resolution now. The display however does look really good, colors, brightness, viewing angles are all great.The flexibility is great as i'm always wanting to tilt my laptop further back. I find tent  and lap modes really useful and i wanted to like table mode. However they didn't put much design thought into tablet mode, as the tablet never really closes flat it's always kind of awkward to hold.Typing on the keyboard was really good though. The keys were a good size and had a good grip to them. I felt like i would not have to compromise type speed or accuracy with it.Battery life; the yoga 11s i had high hopes for in battery life when you compare it to other devices. For instance, the Surface Pro 2 with a higher powered 4200u processor, higher resolution sceen, and the same capacity battery gets around 8 hours of use. So considering everything i hoped for around 10 hours of use.  Some benchmarks i performed were:Normal user (web briowsing, videos etc) : around 6 hoursNetflix: 7.5 hoursPeacekeeper browser benchmark: 5.7 hourslocal video : 7.1 hoursThis isn't bad but considering i can buy a device with the same battery, and decently lower powered specs it is a disappointment.Performance, the 4210y and intel HD 4200 graphics give decent performance on the yoga 11s but nothing astoundingly different from its predecessor.3dmark ice storm: 299713dmark 06: 3500Cinebench: CPU: 1.72 , GPU: 13.87 fpspcmark 7: 3303Performance results are the top end of the 4210y (thankfully not throttled) but nothing to much more than the old sandy bridge I5 from the previous version.I really liked the yoga 11s I just wish it were able to live up to the specs it had. Making something to be used as a tablet you need the battery to back it up. However if those numbers work for you the laptop is a great performer. The flexibility adds a great amount of usability and the keyboard is top notch.UPDATE: So after some software updates from intel and microsoft it looks like the battery front has gotton bettery. With light browsing, microsoft word and other light tasks I could get around 9 hours. I set the Intel dynamic platform power to 1 on battery and it lowers the voltage the processor can use, it helped decently. Performance is pretty fine, not really all that much off what the 4200U processor can do. I  used a different lenovo laptop with a TN screen instead of IPS and was immediatly happy of the Yoga's screen, contrast and viewing angles are night and day. Lenovo has some better keyboards on other laptops, I like their curved accutype keys but the 11s isn't to shabby still. Honestly I don't know if I will be able to go back to non flexible laptops after this, thankfully it's becoming a trend.Also note, I replaced the Ram stick with an 8gb stick, all you do is take off 4 screws at the bottom and take the keyboard off and it's right there (look up the yoga 11s maintenance manual), the SSD is slightly longer but from the looks of it, you can replace it decently easy.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lenovo Yoga 11s", "Author": "Charlie", "ReviewID": "R1IRMFQ7O8G0S4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my Lenovo Yoga 11s a little over a month. Finally sold my beloved Samsung Go 10.1, because these 71 years old eyes needed something larger. After much research and reading reviews on Amazon. I purchased the Yoga. I couldn't be more pleased. Although it is used mostly when I'm traveling to Europe, I still wanted something that gives me at least 6-7 hours of battery life. After getting the Yoga, I fully charged the battery and used it about an hour a day until the battery got down to 25%. BINGO! At 25%, I still had 1 hour and 50 minutes left, which means I got around 5 hours and 30 minutes on 75% of usage. I'm sure happy with that. Granted, I don't watch any movies or do hardly any downloading, but with the new Haswell Processor in this Yoga, you get great battery life. In addition, it's easy to carry and screen colors are super. I also upgraded to Windows 8.1 a few weeks ago. I'm still a fan of Windows 7, but I'm getting to know Windows 8.1 better. The only problem that I had with the Yoga is the pre-installed Bloatware. I've since removed most of that. I am very pleased with this product. One last thing!

The Intel HD Grphics 4000 card is fine for light gaming.My real beef with this laptop is the Realtek wifi adapter, I don't have problems dropping WIFI like many of the other reviewers.  The problem with Realtek is that it is not supported by Intel's Wireless Display (WIDI).  For those who do not know, WIDI is a cool feature that allows you to wirelessly extend your laptop screen onto your TV as long as you have a WIDI adapter connected to you TV.  It acts just like a second monitor were plugged into your computer.  This feature appealed to me because I could stream to my TV and work on my computer at the same time or look at documents on a big TV.But why couldn't you just replace the wireless adapter in the computer?  From what I can tell Realtek made a custom WIFI adapter for this computer that has a unique form factor.It looks like the Yoga 13 and 11s (and probably the 11) share the same WIFI adapter.

Amazon made it OK though as they discounted the computer for what was thought to be a third gen price.Would I buy this again? Yup, just not from this seller.", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it love it love it", "Author": "M. K.

At the first, I thought 4GB ram too little.  Also, the screen might be too little for doing big job.  Well, the actual usage shows this one runs a lot faster than my i7 notebook, probably due to the new SSD drive.  In addition, when it runs on desk in home, I just plug the HDMI cable to a 1080P 24\" TV, then split the screen between the ulltrabook and TV screen.  It is really nice.It also has built-in Bluetooth, so that it can pair with Bluetooth speaker.  Great little thing can easily carry, fold like tablet, and work in home as main work horse.
