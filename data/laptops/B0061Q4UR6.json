I can play games thanks to its powerful video card; watch movies on its great screen; work on my documents and appreciate the wide keyboard squares. So far, no complaints. The only thing (and I assume that to be the case for EVERY laptop, anyway) I was a bit disappointed about was that the battery's charge does NOT last as much as the computer's specs claim it does.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's pretty awesome, but take note...", "Author": "chris \"CGHearn\"", "ReviewID": "R1CGU0J9MGJENC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really enjoy this laptop. I spend around 12 - 14 hours a day on my laptop coding websites and using the Adobe Creative Suite (CS4/5). Needless to say, I need a laptop that can handle major graphic capabilities and numerous programs running at the same time without lagging. After digging around on numerous sites to check the benchmarks for Intel and AMD chips and talking to a local PC repair shop, I decided to go with a quad core AMD chip. Not only did this save me money (around $100-$150), but gave me the same quality and speed I needed from an Intel i5.I have owned it for about a month now and although I still stand by my purchase and I enjoy what I purchased, I have noticed a few things that should be considered. Below are some pros and cons.Pros:1600 X 900 Resolution17\" monitorAMD quad core processorDecent graphic abilities (Dirt 2, Portal, Portal 2, Adobe CS5)64-bit4GB RAM (upgradable to 8GB)Glossy graphitish colored finish10-key number padHDMI outputWindows 73 USB ports1 combo USB 2.0/3.0 portNotification LED colors/brightnessThe power cord connects in a secure, flush connectionBuilt-in webcam/microphoneCons:No mute buttonLeft shift key doesn't recognized that it's pressed unless you're pressing directly on the middle (I don't know if this is just mine or a model issue)No Bluetooth (even though it's listed as having it)I have never been able to get the sleep&charge; USB port to work. I'm not sure if it doesn't or I just haven't figured it out. Either way it's a minor annoyance.The monitor lid is a little flexible in the center. I don't know if it will affect the picture construction over time or not.Webcam quality (at least in my experience through occasional use) isn't very great quality. It's functional, but the color and resolution could certainly be improved.Overall, there aren't any major flaws or issues that I have found (unless you wanted internal Bluetooth), but in the case the cons I have listed would be an issue, you might need to consider that into your purchase.Also, on an unrelated note, I discovered (well actually I was told by a Best Buy employee and found it to be true) that an XBOX 360 wired controller (there is an XBOX 360 for PC controller out there for $10 more, but it also requires a software portion for it to work which (I was told) can lead to a delay at times) can be used without any configuration (other than button assignment in the occasional game) to play games on your PC. I have loved playing games on my laptop with an XBOX controller. Finally a quality/easy option for people like myself that can't manage to master the keyboard gaming option.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Performance", "Author": "csmith", "ReviewID": "R187DZ5R04WSCH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a video editor who also likes to watch streaming movies on my laptop. 17 inch screen, super fast processor, quad core multitasking capabilities...no complaints at all. It's very user friendly, great spacious keyboard and mousepad. The best laptop money can buy you for the price. i7 processors are overrated, AMD is the best because its quad core is actually 4 cores, not 2 with the capability of stretching.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Laptop does not have bluetooth, specifications are wrong.", "Author": "Robin H", "ReviewID": "R20D19P61OMT2F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop a little over a month ago and at first I loved everything about it, that is until I tried connecting it to my bluetooth printer which is one of the main reason I picked this model,  after a lot of trying I finally called Toshiba only to be told they made a mistake and the laptop does not have bluetooth after all and their solution was if my laptop was still within its warranty period, to take it back to the store and get another model.Luckily I bought an extended warranty and the store where I purchased the laptop gave me a free bluetooth adapter for my laptop to make up for the mistake even though it was Toshiba's fault because they were the ones who said it was suppose to have bluetooth.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "17.3\" High-definition widescreen LED-backlit TFT with TruBrite technology (1600 x 900)\nAMD Quad-Core A6-3400M (2.3GHz, 4MB Cache) CPU\n4GB Memory; 500GB Hard disk; Multiformat DVD\u00b1RW/CD-RW drive with double-layer support\nAMD Radeon HD 6520G graphics\nBuilt-in webcam with microphone,", "Name": "Toshiba Satellite L775D-S7305 Laptop AMDA6-340M/4GB RAM/500GB/17.3 inch", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21ciMwrpTsL.jpg", "ProductID": "B0061Q4UR6"}}
