So this is a review based solely on my experience with this laptop.This is the exact same size as the MacBook Air, but feels heavier.  Still, I really like the speed and function of this laptop.  The boot speed is very nice for a fully functioning computer (I also have a chromebook from Toshiba and it boots much faster, but that is to be expected). The keyboard has the same great tactile experience of my other Toshiba, the keys take the perfect amount of pressure and are spaced exactly right,  at least for me.  The screen quality is awesome.I bought this specifically because of the Toshiba Chromebook of the same size, the keyboard on both of these are my favorites. As much as I would like to be able to use the Chromebook as my sole computer, it just doesn't have the full function of Windows.So far everything I've used this for has been seamless and simple.  It hooked up easily with my wifi and wifi printer.  The speakers sound good.  The fan is very quiet.  The screen is weighted properly so you don't have to push down and pull up at the same time.Both in form and function, this is a winner.** My 16 year old son has confiscated this and it is now his.  He loves it and plays a lot of big-memory action games with no problem.", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,349.00", "Features": "Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 i5-4300M Processor\nWindows 7 Professional (available through downgrade rights from Windows 8.1 Pro)\n8GB DDR3L 1600MHz\n128GB mSATA solid state drive (SSD)\nDVD SuperMulti drive", "Name": "Portege R30-A1301 13.3\" LED Notebook - Intel Core i5 i5-4300M 2.60 GHz - Graphite Black Metallic", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41H%2BnREw4qL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00HYI4U8O"}}
