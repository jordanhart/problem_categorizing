{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Toshiba repair and service - A JOKE!", "Author": "kathleen carvalho", "ReviewID": "R3L3ZJT58ER3H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought it in January 2013. On March 10 the screen failed without any physical damage done to it.Called Toshiba and explained the problem. The technician instructed me to send the computercomputer to Toshiba Repair Depot (cost $25.00) to be fixed. Upon receiving the computer, Toshibainformed me that their warranty did not cover damaged screen. First of all, the screen was not damaged,it simply failed to perform. Second, why did the technician instructed me to send the computer for repair?The compute cost me $365.00 at Amazon.Toshiba Repair Depot offered to fix the problem as follows:Cost of the repairs (all amounts are USD)Parts:  $ 206.95  (LCD Panel)Labor: $60.00Total:  $ 266.95Plus:  $25.00 already paid for shippingTotal  $291.95I declined their offer, of course. Contacted Screendoctors.com and bought aa brand new replacement screen ($81.00 + 14.53 shipping = $95.53 total), including the toolsneeded to do the repair (that's 1/3 of what it would cost me to have laptop fixed by Toshiba).And the replacement screen comes with a two year warranty - which Toshiba does not eve offer.Shame on them!!! I will never buy another Toshiba product again and will spread the word around.", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great laptop for the price!", "Author": "Candace Woodyard", "ReviewID": "R2WY3USIZPR4Q2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great value on this laptop..works great...all the cool features my daughter wanted like windows 8, webcam and sim card slot.", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "It does what you need it to do.", "Author": "Valerie P.

Their solution is demanding a fee to replace a hard drive they intentionally setup for failure.Aside from that, this is a very underappreciated and overpowered system, dollar for dollar it is a high performance server disguised as a 5lb sled with a lid and the prettiest screen you can buy for any price, even Apple Retina displays can't outdo the brilliance of this display. Spend about $50 for a RAM upgrade to the max 16GB and you can host a true server environment such as Microsoft 2012 Server used for cloud computing (they're trying to) or 2008 DataCenter the top line Battlestar of Microsoft Servers, even the 2008HPC r/2 that is gibberish for a purposely built Ferarri Windows Server tuned for efficiency this Toshiba can use.The color blue and violet is the best barometer when testing any LCD since those are the hardest colors mammals can interpret and it is masterful at depicting the entire color scale.  I could give you links to blue scarves or ocean scenes to chase down but they won't accurately depict the intensity unless I refer you to an online professional color scale site that shows mathematically how brilliantly and expertly this LCD is and you should visit it with your computer to determine how yours compares.But, it has major drawbacks that can kneecap your entire experience", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great!", "Author": "Symfani", "ReviewID": "RHFJB6VI1DZ91", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this computer!
