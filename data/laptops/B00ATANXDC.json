I sold the iPad and I purchased the Lenovo G585 because the price point was good, particularly with the specs included, and because of the good reviews.It ended up being a bad decision. It is near impossible to watch a streaming video without it being patchy in either the video or sound, even with no other programs or windows open. It's very frustrating, since I don't have a TV and would want to watch Hulu or Netlflix, and it makes it difficult with Facebook or Youtube videos. Even gifs don't display properly or smoothly. Regular webpages without any media content also display that \"patchy\" behavior, where it gets stuck in places when you're trying to scroll and even the text you are typing does not show up evenly. Pages take quite a bit to load and forget about trying to open up multiple tabs on a web browser. My first day using it, I had IE and Spotify open and it froze and crashed. I haven't even tried installing most of the apps I'd like to have, including Word, because I know it will just be frustrating.I am told it's quite possibly a Windows 8 problem, but this computer doesn't come with a Windows 7 downgrade and I'm not willing to spend more money on an installation CD. On top of that, Windows 8 is pretty frustrating to use. I'm returning the computer, and I hope I can warn some others to not waste their time.", "Date": "May 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lenovo Good!  Windows 8 - Not so Much", "Author": "James \"2020 In a blink\"", "ReviewID": "RN44E6V4ZMD9S", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I gave this to my wife for her birthday a while ago.  After realizing that Windows 8 is set up as if it was being used on a mobile device, she became a little more accepting of the product.  The problem, of course, is that absent swipe actions on the screen (the screen is not set up to be touch sensitive), the operating system becomes a pain in the neck.  It appears as if Microsoft is again trying to press the world into it's vision of what hardware should be present in a system, rather than writing software to work with the hardware that is in place.  Some things never change.The other major problem is that the computer 'jumps' as she is typing (according to her). In trying to find out what she was talking about, and after attempting various searches on the net, it appears that the touch pad is too sensitive, and if she happens to double tap it while typing it will take her to whatever place the system assumed the cursor was on at the time the double tap was interpreted. We are still working through this one, but I think she may be able to turn the touchpad on an off with a Fn F8 combination.Finally, the system came with a ridiculous amount of bloatware, and in the first hour she was using it the processor was pegged as it attempted to bring all kinds of extraneous crap up to date - and of course, bring Windows 8 up to the latest version according to the mother ship in Redmond.When will manufacturers get smart and start building systems that don't have to be upgraded every two weeks?

It froze constantly and stuttered. Within three weeks it broke completely whereupon I took it to a repair store that told me it had been sold to me with a fault hard drive. No worries, I had a six month warranty so I gave it to Lenovo to fix. They took 40 days. To replace a hard drive. If they had just mailed me the component it would have taken me 20 minutes. In the meantime the warranty specified I'd receive a replacement computer but they didn't give me one. Eventually they gave in to my persistence and gave me one but it was amazingly worse than the machine itself and broke after four days whereupon they gave me a Mac that was beautiful and worked amazingly. I wish I'd been allowed to keep that one. Two weeks later my old machine was fixed and returned to me.So it worked, kind of, for three months, then broken again, this time the frame itself. The hinge clean snapped and again, it took around a month to repair. They gave me a half-decent replacement straightaway this time.Once again it kept working until recently, where we returned to problem (1) except I'm not sure it's the hard drive because I'm not going to bother repairing it, I'm going to buy a different make of laptop in the sales.Summary: if this machine were being offered for free and it were a 20 minute walk from your place, you'd still be wasting your time by getting it.

Everything works satisfactorily until 4 months later. The laptop wouldn't boot and the error message points at a hard disk drive failure.Request #1: A quick and pleasant call to Lenovo and, two days later, I receive a replacement drive and reinstallation DVDs. The hard drive is used, below the specification of my previous drive... and started to fail noisily in the middle of the reinstallation procedure!Request #2: Calling Lenovo and asking for another drive, which I receive promptly. I install the drive (used parts and below specs again), turn the laptop on and... What's that horrible whining sound?! Conclusion: Yet another failed disk. And to be sure of my diagnostic, I extract an old drive from an old laptop. I successfully reinstall my Lenovo laptop and the old drive.Request #3: Calling Lenovo again. They want me to return the laptop. I make sure they understand the nature of the problem, why returning the laptop makes little sense and why I expect a drive with, at least, the same specifications as the one I originally bought. A week later, the promised drive wasn't there yet (and actually never arrived).Request #4: On the phone with Lenovo... They don't know what happened to the previous drive. They'll send a new one, with the right specifications. I didn't bother opening the drive when I received it, it wasn't the right kind!!! In the meantime, tired of waiting, I had bought a new drive at a local store. Unsurprisingly, it did wonder in my laptop.Request #5: Moving online to avoid being impolite on the phone. There, I go through a weird registration and realized all the limit of their support tools. I almost feel sad for the support people working there. I try my best to describe all the extent of my issues with Lenovo. The field limit to 150 characters don't help, at all. My request: A real solution, in the form of a real drive or a real check to cover the purchase of a new real drive. And, a couple of days later, I receive... an empty box?? After some head-scratching, I understand they want me to return my laptop... #FacePalm!!! It's time to share my story with the Amazonians.Request #6: I'll get to that as soon as I'm done posting this story.

It is also designed to work on tablets and touchscreens.  This computer is not a tablet and it does not have touch screens.  This makes navigation and functionality difficult.  I have different shoes for different activities.  In Microsoft's view of the computing world, I wear the same shoes for hiking, basketball and formal occasions.
