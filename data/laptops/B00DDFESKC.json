{"Reviews": [{"Title": "For the money, you can't do much better", "Author": "Nathan", "ReviewID": "R1R6LG13BCPSKT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this Acer for about two months now and considering the price (~$450), this computer does everything I need it to incredibly fast. I recommend this computer for anyone who needs a budget laptop that is moderately portable, runs quiet and cool, and can easily handle moderate computing loads. With a few minor gripes, this computer is perfect for what most people need.[Note: I actually bought this computer about 3 months ago and the first one I got was a lemon. Basically, the right arrow key was \"held down\" without pressing it, rendering all but the most basic tasks impossible. Amazon, to its credit, replaced the computer in about two days (before I had even returned the broken one) and the new computer works like a dream and I haven't had any problems with it.]Pros:-- Starts up from sleep instantly, from hibernation in about 3 seconds, and boots from restart/shutdown in about 25 seconds. I was considering a laptop with an SSD boot drive, and this computer obviates any need for one.-- Runs incredibly fast. This machine has more than enough memory for almost any moderate task (4GB) but is easily expandable to 8GB for about $50. The fourth generation i5 processor is excellent. I've tried to make it sputter by running too many things at once, and it hasn't buckled yet. This machine easily handles five or six 1080p videos playing simultaneously with other software such as Office and MediaMonkey running in the background. I don't do PC gaming, so I can't speak to that.-- Almost no bloatware, and it was easily uninstalled.-- The battery life is pretty solid; I've gotten 4+ hours of netflix instant on a single charge with battery life to spare.-- The screen is bright with good color accuracy. I didn't think I would need a 15.6 inch screen, but it's worth it for streaming video and having lots of real estate for things like excel documents.-- The keyboard is full size with small gaps between the keys that cut down on missed keystrokes. All the buttons are solid with a satisfying \"bounce-back\". Some people have complained about sticky keys, especially the spacebar. That has not been an issue for me, in fact, quite the opposite. There is also a full size numeric keypad if that is a big deal for you.-- Considering the size of the laptop, it's pretty lightweight and easy to carry.-- Lots of people have complained about windows 8, but with the 8.1 update, I basically never have to look at that stupid launch screen and can just boot to the desktop. I don't even notice the difference between this and Windows 7, so it doesn't seem like a reason to shy away.Cons:-- The built-in mousepad is large and overly sensitive to the palms of my hands when I'm typing. I have to turn it off 100% of the time. I just use a small wireless mouse (this one: B003I4FF1O and it's easily ignored.-- No optical drive. If you need a DVD or blu-ray player, this is a problem, but I haven't used one on a pc in 3 years, so it doesn't seem totally necessary.-- No SSD. This is really the reason for the laptop's low price and I haven't noticed any data read/write speed issues, but it definitely would have been nice to have.-- The speakers sound and volume is below average. There is a slight crackle at the higher end of the spectrum when pushed to max volume.-- Full Office does not come preinstalled (there is a standard 30 day trial version), so keep in mind that's going to run you another 100 bucks. I haven't found another third-party PC with full office preinstalled, though, so I think this is pretty standard.Overall this laptop has been exactly what I need. Fast and quiet, at a very competitive price. For what you get from this machine, I don't think you can find a better deal. And from first hand experience, if it doesn't work exactly right, Amazon will rectify it FAST.

I've had some great experience with this laptop and it can even handle some great gaming if that's what you're into.League of Legends; Highest setting-~35fps; I've also played Civilization V in the highest setting with very slight lag.The operating System:Seriously, if you don't like it. You can easily download a program called Classic Shell which gives you the start button back with no complaints.

This things is attracted with finger prints and dark marks can be seen all over it. Even with the slightest touch the laptop can get very dirty and it may seem a bit difficult to clean.-Obviously there's no Optical Disk Drive, cant expect it from such a thin laptop.-Sound on this device is kind of bad, doesn't get very loud and to make matters worse.

Turner", "ReviewID": "RD4I58KWVYCP0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This brand new laptop arrived in late June 2013 and upon unpacking I was in love. It did have a dead battery but worked on the power brick while charging. That day was my first time using Win8 I was not impressed at all with the stupid changes by Microsoft and wished I had the very same machine with Win7 instead. After a few hours I learned what I needed to mostly turn off the new features from Microsoft so it worked like Win7. However I then had to go online to download a tiny bit of software from PC World magazine that enabled me to add an icon to the taskbar that was labeled \"Shutdown PC\". That worked great. So far this computer has performed much better (except for the crappy Win8) than my old laptop and cost just over half as much. If Acer would offer an option to order this unit with Win7 installed I would have given it the highest rating available. My favorite thing about it is the price.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Value, Minus the DVD/CDWR", "Author": "Pen Name", "ReviewID": "R2LZOZKG9XMA2F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a Great Laptop for the money. comes with and I5 for the price of an I3. it runs smooth and fast.Pros:low price for I5runs fastHDMI PortNumber padCons:No DVD/CDRWno touch screenwindows 8", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good comp", "Author": "Izzy H", "ReviewID": "R34IWN54JYXGOS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently bought this to replace an HP that was past its prime and am happy so far with my purchase. The biggest drawback for me is windows 8 which is just not doing it for me. I realize this is a problem with any new model PC I buy so it's not an Acer specific issue. It was relatively easy for me to fix this problem though after some basic googling to get the windows 7 look/feel that I prefer. I wound up downloading Start8 and ModernMix to enable me to get the old start menu/interface of windows 7. These both cost $4.99 (liking the FB page gets you 10% off this though and both offer free 30 day trials). There's also the classic shell app that can be downloaded (it's free!) and it seemed to have more customizable options but I like the ease of Start8 and the price was worth it for me.Overall, I like the keyboard - the spacing and give of the keys is perfect for me. I prefer a laptop with the number pad on the right so this is good for me. One negative with regards to the keyboard though is that there isn't a separate mute key so you have to hit the Fn button to use it (it doubles with F8). That's a small negative and is more a product of me being used to the mute key being easy to just hit with one finger. One other drawback is the mouse pad. It's quite large and has one big click bar rather than separated out, which again is partially a preference thing. But it is also a little easy to hit the mouse pad sometimes.If you stick with the windows 8 format/layout (rather than using Start8 or classic shell to get the windows 7 feel), then the mouse pad becomes a bit of a hindrance because it's really easy to keep accidentally brushing it and opening up that sidebar menu for the windows 8 settings/apps/etc. I'l admit I was super frustrated about that (it was happening a lot) but now it's not a problem b/c of Start8.It is important to know that this computer doesn't come with a DVD/CD drive. It's a slight negative but I just bought an external dvd drive (which can be used as a DVD player for a tv too)on amazon and it works fine. Honestly, I don't really have much of a need for a DVD drive anyway, but I wanted the option because some of the software I wanted to install is on CDs and it's good to have in case. The lack of the DVD drive is nice though since it makes for a lighter/thinner laptop and it's not really something I need most of the time. There is a piece that covers where a DVD drive would normally be and it's possible that you could install an internal DVD drive in that spot if so inclined.I also like the all-black model, which is something that is different from all my previous laptops. I can see what some other reviewers have said about smudges showing up but it doesn't really seem like an issue to me. I'm quite happy with the screen (I just love the larger screens!) and the visuals seem pretty good. I've used the webcam and I'm pleased with the quality. The sound isn't bad, pretty standard laptop fair but I have external speakers and headphones can solve that problem easily.There doesn't seem to be a ton of pre-loaded apps (and they're easy to uninstall) so no real complaints there. Obviously this computer doesn't come with Microsoft Office so that may factor into pricing for you. Fortunately I can get it free through school and it was super easy to install. It does have the option of a free 30 day trial for the Office 365 so you won't be without initially anyway.Bottom line - Few cons (minor, easy to fix), budget friendly.", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "As good as you will get for the price", "Author": "Chris E.

It works, performs and shows. I highly recommend this laptop if you are under a budget but really need a working computer. That is enough for its comment. However, you might still get some problems when you buy it home. In order to help you guys keep away from the troubles, let me list them.First but the most important, NEVER UPDATE TO WINDOWS 8.1!!The windows 8 is just adapted for this laptop, that means you had better not change it. So if you are a guy who likes me to pursue the newest version and update to 8.1, all you get is nothing but an annoying bitch which you cannot shutdown or restart forever! The only way to close it is pressing the power button for 10 seconds! The solution is that I used Acer recovery management to reset the laptop. Now it is working perfectly.Furthermore, you might not able to handle win 8 system smoothly since many differences between win 7 and 8. Check youtube or some other tutorial videos to get used to win 8. Honestly it is a pretty good system. It wont take too long to be familiar with it but you still need some time.Screen resolution is not ideal but considering about the price, it is fair. 1366*768 is so low for gaming or 3D works and the graphic processor is integrated. So please make sure you will not do any heavy graphic works or you should check some other brand laptops.Neither DVD drives nor mic but 3 USB ports. Maximum support for 8 GB RAM and only one 4GB RAM is installed. unscrew the back plastic cover, you will see another RAM slot empty. So you can buy a RAM to upgrade your memory. Recommend you to do that.Alright, basically that is the troubles what I have met so far. Hope my experience could help you guys to know this laptop more.
