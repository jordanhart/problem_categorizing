Barely tolerable when casually browsing or checking email, it struggled through even Plants vs. Zombies.  While I have a Gateway gaming laptop, it is 5 years old and weighs like 13 pounds.  I wanted something light but still able to do casual gaming.  I figured a 3rd gen Intel i3 and a 15 inch screen was the bare minimum I would settle for. After building a comparison spreadsheet of Best Buy available models, the Asus X501A-SPD0503W came out on top.  It was very close as it's specs were neck and neck with the Toshiba C855-S5111.  Unable to decide, I went with the Asus as it was only 4.5 pounds with battery installed (verified with a kitchen scale).versus the Toshiba's 5.4 pounds.  Aside from dealing with Windows 8, the Asus is just what I wanted.  Bloatware is minimal and what is there stays out of my way.Performance wise, here's how it compares with my other laptop on the Unigine Heaven Benchmark tool.Gateway FX-6160 ($1300 5 years ago); Windows Vista (build 6002, Service Pack 2) 64bit; Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU T9300 @ 2.50GHz; NVIDIA GeForce 8800M GTSFPS: 14.1Score: 355Min FPS: 6.2Max FPS: 26.0Asus X501A $369;  Win 8; Intel Core i3-3120M @ 2.50 GHz; Intel HD graphics 4000.FPS: 9.3Score: 235Min FPS: 5.0Max FPS: 20.6That might not seem very good, but the Heaven benchmark is a demanding tool.  Playing a casual game like PanzerCorps (reboot of the Panzer General series from the 90's) shows no slowdown or other deficiencies.  The main point is how close it comes to matching the Core2Duo from just a few years ago", "Date": "May 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pretty darn good", "Author": "Megan", "ReviewID": "RC6C0MJVRGS2X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My old computer had a habit of continuously disconnecting from the internet so i decided i wanted a new one but on the cheaper end. This computer fulfills everything i wanted except it has windows 8. Its not so bad since i downloaded a modification that gives me a start button on the desktop screen. the parts i don't like are the track pad short cuts. i've figured out most of them by accident but i can't figure out how to turn them off. if you swipe one way it changes to the normal windows 8 screen if i swoosh another way it like opens up a view of all the pages i have open. It would be nice if i could turn them off. also the track pad's scroll function scrolls backwards it was really confusing at first but i quickly got used to it.", "Date": "August 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent value if you understand what you're buying", "Author": "Erisian", "ReviewID": "REX3JTFPUR3GR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted an light, inexpensive computer for air travel vacations, with a larger screen than most ultrabooks.  This machine worked OK out of the box, no problems.Pros:  Very quiet fan, light weight for its screen size (no DVD drive helps), inexpensive, looks good.  Trackpad surface is excellent (many trackpads are too slick or too rough for comfort).Cons: Only 2 USB ports (1 is 3.0), mediocre keyboard.I'm very pleased with this machine so far.  Windows 8 works much better after installing free Classic Shell program to avoid pointless \"Metro\" start screen.  It's not ideal for playing Far Cry 3 or writing thousands of words a day, but I have other machines for more demanding tasks.  After replacing the hard drive with a basic SSD (required partial disassembly) this machine is very responsive and more than fast enough for my travel needs.", "Date": "June 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "good for enough to use", "Author": "David Chiang", "ReviewID": "R1X9KQJUYVOSSK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "reasonable price and enough to use for regular user,big screen and color were good for game player and college students too.", "Date": "August 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "less than a year of light use - screw fell out, pads on bottom fell off, key randomly got weird", "Author": "B.
