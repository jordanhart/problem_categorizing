The keyboard really sucks. How can someone even come out with such a poor product??. I am technical guy working and believe me there are many other good products out there which you people can put your money on. I will not recommend this product to anyone. Just wanted to make sure no one else gets cheated like me. This product is not worth the single star which I have given here but was not able to skip that. I urge Amazon to provide an option to give thumbs down to such products.", "Date": "September 9, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0085H660S"}}
