My husband has his own business so it is necessary to have a working computer at all times.  This computer has a 17 inch screen and also a numerical key pad, unlike previous laptops.  We are very pleased with the performance and also we love the ability to change the color.  This is my 4th Dell computer and I have always been pleased with the quality and the technical support that we have used on several occasions.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Superb !!!", "Author": "Ollie", "ReviewID": "R3DXZ1OGNIO8AR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Quite the step up from my old 2004 Dell Inspiron 15\" that still works great...the chassis is just wearing out from everyday use. I have nothing but praise to give Dell. They make an affordable, quality product. This is the 4th Dell computer in my house...my second. I have and would recommend them over and over again to anyone who asks!", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great laptop for the price", "Author": "H", "ReviewID": "RB7OECP1CP95P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought one at bestBuy. An glossy blue polished body wrapped an i3 processor, 4 GB memory and 500 GB 5400 rpm HDD.Construction:The body feels sturdy and light weight. There is very tiny flex on the keyboard and palm rests. Overall construction looks very good. At this price, there is no room for grumbling on this count.Connectivity:It comes with two USB 3.0 ports. It also has the standard HDMI, USB 2.0 and SD card reader ports.Audio/Video:The display is gorgeous and the audio, while not spectacular, is very good and is loud enough without the headphones. The web camera is also good for video chats.Keyboard/Touchpad.The touchpad is smooth and the sensitivity can be configured through the Windows Mobility center. The touchpad buttons though are really hard and clicking on the outer edges of these buttons will give you sore fingers. You have to press them around the middle or inner edge to be kinder to your fingers. The keyboard is good though I felt it could have been a touch softer to type.Wi-Fi:The wifi is pretty good and I did not have any issues using it.Battery:Battery life is about 3 hours on a charge with medium level of processing.Performance:The 2nd Gen Intel\u00ae Core(tm) i3-2350M processor provides higher performance than my previous laptop with i5-520M and it runs really cool.Conclusion:This laptop is sturdy and arrayed with the latest ports. I'd highly recommend it to everyone.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "great  pc", "Author": "Thomas A.

Evans", "ReviewID": "R1JU98NU88NB0N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Im older so don't know and cant judge the bells and whistles of the product but it works well for me and its attractive looking. The only issue I had with it is that it came with lots of games on it (not my thing) and a 30 day free trial of McCaffey but I bought Norton already and so had to pay someone to get that stuff off my computer (told you Im a real basic user). Sometimes I have gliches and manage to muddle through and I don't understand how to find cookies and get rid of them. Then scan disk and defrag are difficult to find so any problems I had were not with the machine but the way the software was set up. The computer itself is great and now I don't have to drive my powerchair to the library to use a computer so I am very grateful its working well. I was concerned because it was a big buy for my budget.", "Date": "May 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beware of Amazon false statement for this laptop", "Author": "John R. Tucker", "ReviewID": "R20BHY54HZC5WW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I hooked up this new laptop and it functions very well. If you read all of the information on the page for this laptop, Amazon recommends a Netgear push2tv ptv2000. Please check with the people at Netgear before spending $91.00 for something that isn't compatible with this model's Widi. After purchasing the ptv2000, all it would see is my laptop's wallpaper and nothing else. I called Netgear 3 times before I found someone who could speak clear English and after some researching, they was told that the only adapter that was functional with this laptop is the Netgear neotv (ptv200). Tonight I will try to see if it works or not. I read that the neotv pro might be better. I was assured today by Netgear that my neotv ptv200 would turn my flatscreen into a smart tv. We'll see. I have my doubts. Finally, Why doesn't Amazon or Dell include the Window's 7 disk?UPDATE: 7/13/2012  The Netgear ptv200 did not work. I sent it back and got the Netgear neotv pro. Now everything works as it should. I am a happy camper.Customer service and tech support at Dell is the best I have ever seen.", "Date": "July 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not what we expected.", "Author": "Kindle Lover", "ReviewID": "RKHOF7CF7ZYZ2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "PC very slow. Could not link via home network. Called Dell phone support who turned out to be quite hostile. Kept insisting we upgrade to a pay for support. We've had the laptop for less than 5 days. We have another Dell - same model - purchased from Costco with Costco Concierge service. Great support and lasts as long as you own your laptop. Would not buy through Amazon again given the poor support after purchase. Dell support transferring us from one place to another. Most unhelpful. Michael Dell would not be pleased with this customer experience.
