This laptop randomly came apart on the 92nd day I had it. The hinge suddenly stuck and the metal part of the hinge inside of the lid pulled the lid apart. If you're going to buy something expensive on Amazon you should only buy it FROM Amazon. Third party sellers like Fatech have no liability for faulty or defective gear they sell you and they will not be shy about letting you know that the defective gear they sold you is NOT their problem. I do not recommend this laptop. I do not recommend this seller. I DO recommend that you look elsewhere for your goods. Here there are only problems.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00BD0D1FM"}}
