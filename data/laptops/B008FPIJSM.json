MacMillan", "ReviewID": "RI6LBJTQXE8FN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Hard drive on this laptop crashed within a few months of very light use. Recovery disks would not work so sent it to Gateway for warranty service. I had to pay shipping $25.85 without insurance (big mistake). They claimed I sent it in with the case broken and since I would not pay $210.94 to fix the broken corner they would not repair the hard drive. They sent a picture of the box and there is no visible damage on the box. It was packaged very well with the PC in the middle surrounded by tons of bubble wrap and air bags. I thought they were mixing up customer orders. They made it clear it was my laptop and they would not cover anything unless I paid the $210.94. They also told me they receive 1000, yes one thousand, computers back for service every day. At this point I was raging and told them to send it back to me. THEN I'm told if they send it back I cannot claim the $100 UPS allows for damaged merchandise that was not insured. I thought I was in the Twilight Zone - these people are out and out liars and thieves!!!I did some research for complaints against Gateway and this same scenario has played out many times over. Acer seems to be the owners of Gateway for whatever that's worth. I tried going to WalMart where the purchase was made but they refused to accept any responsibility for the merchandise they carry. So the end user....me, is out $400 and left without a computer. It's a sad day when large corporations get away with tactics like what I experienced. Suffice that I WILL NEVER own another Gateway and WILL NEVER purchase another PC from WalMart. Shame on both of them.BUYER BEWARE - when a company has no skin in the game it's easy to avoid responsibility.Here's someone else's story: [...]He even paid Gateway $21.25 for their recovery disks which didn't work - OF COURSE THEY DIDN'TUPDATE 7/2/13We tried returning the laptop to our local WalMart. They said they could not take it back that we should return it to the store where it was purchased. We made the 600 mile trip (as part of a vacation) and I'm happy to report that this WalMart did take the computer back and gave us a full refund. Goes to show who believes in their customer base and that GateWay could NOT care less. THANK YOU WALMART.", "Date": "April 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Blue Screen of death", "Author": "Sovena", "ReviewID": "R3W2HCFV2TNT4L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After several months Notebook began blue screening. Called Gateway/Acer for support and they were very reluctant to help. They told us to reboot it to inital config (default). This did not fix issue. Sent the unit back for repair - not sure what they did - still blue screens. After going through this the warranty has passed - tech support said we had insufficient Anti-virus which is BS. They want my company to buy extended warranty to fix. I'm in IT and thier tech support is horrible, not to mention having to but coverage after the fact. I swill never purchase Gateway products for my company again.", "Date": "September 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "so far a great laptop", "Author": "darryl sharpe", "ReviewID": "R28HSO6CY0F3KW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "got this refurbished gateway laptop and have so far been very impressed with the product! looks new and runs great", "Date": "February 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Could Have Been a Great Purchase", "Author": "Nina", "ReviewID": "R7SG7HDPG9ESB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This laptop could have been a great purchase... if it had been packaged properly. I bought it from a 3rd party seller here on Amazon (Secondipity) and it has been, by far, my worst Amazon purchase. I was so excited to get this computer, as my old one crashed a few weeks ago and I really need a laptop for school. So imagine my surprise and confusion when it arrives in an original Gateway box (instead of down inside a shipping box) without any bubblewrap or packing peanuts around it. At that point, I didn't really think anything of it because the laptop itself looked unscathed (wait for it). After I charged it for the required amount of time, I turned it on and the screen was completely white with a few colorful liness on the right side of the screen. It looked as if the hard drive was somehow damaged during shipping (surprise, surprise!) I immediately called Secondipity and their customer service line was down. Soo after a series of events too exhausting to list here, I was finally able to get the laptop sent back and I'm just waiting to get the money put back on my card.

I have to say that my previous laptop computer was free to me and served me well for many years until my dog broke a bunch of keys off of the keyboard.  The display on the current computer is nice, but not as high of quality as my old Micron.  Beware the hot keys that double as function keys.  I'd rather they default as function keys (maybe there's a way to change that?) because they've gotten me into trouble a few times.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Gateway NE56R10u Notebook Computer, Intel B820, 3GB, 320GB, 15.6\" HD", "Author": "William A.

If you read my seller feedback you'll see that I was skeptical of their claim that this item was being sold as \"used\" but was \"new, in an opened box\" (described as a case of buyer's remorse). Turns out that was, as far as I can tell, exactly the condition that this computer was in. And, by the way, based on this one laptop I am raising my opinion of the Acer brand.

Used proper keystrokes to rebuild from factory partitions. Worked fine.On warranty horror stories in these reviews...I guess its possible Gateway damaged your laptop after arrival at warranty depot, and played dumb. The $200 they wanted was cheap to get the thing back completely repaired, but I understand your resistance. Shipping something for warranty is almost always problematic. Sometimes these extended warranties are not a bad way to go. Failure? Make the call and a gift card arrives in the mail. SquareTrade allows for cash credit onto purchasing c/card.Forget doing recovery disks. To protect from loss, do a full image backup periodically of ALL PARTITIONS (not just c:) via acronis optical boot. Boot to optical renders hd static, so backup is pristine, no open files. Use external blu-ray burner to minimize number of optical disks concatenated. Restore even brings back FACTORY REBUILD partitions, so you can still do a factory rebuild if need be.Other strategy is just keep everything under c:\\users..., and backup ONLY that tree periodically. If crash, you have the OS install id from the back of the laptop. Get new hd, borrow a win7/win8 disk, and use install id to rebuild os legally, re-install all software, use backup to get back lost files. Less hassle with backup, a lot of work rebuilding, no data loss. Understand what a full and incremental backup is to avoid piecemeal data loss.Good luck, GH", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best product for its price", "Author": "Shianne", "ReviewID": "R3J7YNPXUQ4CZ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a little apprehensive about a refurbished laptop.

I connected it to my TV in my living room via HDMI, and we used it to watch movies, and look at Amazon stuff, etc. It worked incredibly for the first year I had it. Then it started having problems. One is it is very loud, I can hear the fans whining across my living room, and my living room is a pretty decent size. The second problem it has is a fatal error with its hard drive. It fails a lot to install updates from Windows, and fails to install crucial programs that cause large changes in the way Windows operates on the machine. Another is that it has been getting slower and slower, because a single-core Celeron is a processor weaker than that of most tablets nowadays. But the HDMI output puts out good quality, and paired with the right cable, great sound as well, I use it with my surround system here and there to watch movies. It is one mother of a hot little laptop, just touching the fan vent on the side is barely touchable. But it has great battery life, and it charges rather quickly. But overall, I am satisfied with the computer, but soon I will replace it with something more modern, like Apple TV, or Roku 3, something of the sort.", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Gateway 15.6\" Laptop 3GB 320GB | NE56R10u", "Author": "Tim Bretz", "ReviewID": "R1XI4QZ00T7D92", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This item arrived securely packaged & undamaged.
