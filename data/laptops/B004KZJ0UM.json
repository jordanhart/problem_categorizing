I did not even know that they have it here on Amazon Marketplace too. Even though the description said manufacturer refurbished the laptop I received looked like new. It came with power adapter and a Dell Windows XP Reinstallation CD and built in Intel PROSet Wireless Card. Absolutely no bloatware is included.Now this may not be a top of the line machine but it is pretty adequate for home and school or even Small Home Office use. The neat part is that once you boot up the machine for the first time it would automatically install Windows XP after going through some preliminary steps. It even gives you option to enter setup and configure things but you are better off leaving the machine alone to do its thing and install windows XP or whichever operating system it is bundled with unless you're techie. Once windows finishes installation you can pretty much install anything you want. I have so far installed Open Office, MS Office 2003, Firefox, Chrome, Avast Anti Virus, Trusteer Rapport security Software and many other productivity softwares and the machine boots up and runs smoothly.It does not come with webcam so I installed Logitech Quickcam Pro 9000 and Microsoft Lifecam Cinema and either camera runs smoothly even on HD modes. I use Lifecam Cinema more often because it's stand is perfect fit for D630 bezel as opposed to the Quickcam Pro 9000's stand which tend to wobble.I will advise you buy this laptop directly from Dell either here on Amazon Marketplace or on ebay where it is listed under Dell_Financial_Services. You will likely receive a laptop that will be like new but more importantly you will get 30 days warranty.This laptop is of right price, size and specs: 14\" bright LCD, 2GB Ram, 80GB harddisk space and 2GHZ Intel Dual Core processor that is more than adequate for most home, school and or Small Home Office use. It is sturdy and sleek looking too.There is one thing that Dell scrimped on here: the tiny single speaker that is barely audible! I use an external Frisby USB laptop Speakers. I also use headphone when I am on the road. It is worthy to note that this tiny speaker belies a powerful sound card that only becomes apparent when you put on a headphone.NB: Don't forget to switch on the wireless radio or you will not be able to use the wifi connection. The switch is on same side and next to the headphone jack. It is switched off by default. Once you switch it on it will detect a bunch of wifi hot spots including yours, if any. Select your SSID from the displayed options and enter your router's WEP Key and you will be good to go. I have at&t; 2WIRE Wireless Gateway and the WEP Key is the ten digit number directly below the serial number located on the side or bottom of the router depending on whether it is standing vertically or lying on it's side. The built in wireless card is powerful. I highly recommend this laptop to anyone who may be on budget but not willing to compromise on quality and performance.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Caution", "Author": "Teddi Bear", "ReviewID": "R27CIE3FIWLFNK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this laptop in a timely manner and it appears to be in excellent shape.

So when hubby murdered his laptop by spilling a drink into it, I thought this D630 would be the perfect replacement for him.  When it arrived, we were both a bit disappointed.  It functions correctly but has a loose lid/screen that can wobble and some sticking keys and generally looks quite used.  He's satisfied enough to keep it, partly because he doesn't want to be without one for any length of time, and partly because we've had positive experiences with off-lease Dells in the past even if they have a wart or two.My personal disappointment was that after receiving the first one, I expected the same level of quality from the second one because at that time, it was sold by Amazon -- not a marketplace refurb seller where you can never be sure of what you'll get until you open the box.", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Buy the service contract with this item", "Author": "Harold K.

Be sure you buy the warranty!", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Little Computer!", "Author": "Vanessa", "ReviewID": "R1VPA6QNW84WEL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased one of these laptops from Link-Tronics Memory through Amazon, to replace a laptop my grandmother had that she lost in a wildfire in Texas.  She loved it! But more importantly, she took it to her computer guy and he said it was an excellent computer - better than any refurbished computer he sold.Then I purchased one for my sister who has wanted a laptop for a while.Finally I purchased one for my teenage son for Christmas.What I was thrilled about these little laptops is that they came loaded and tweaked almost exactly how I would done. In all honesty, I was prepared with my OS disc and drivers and programs to reformat, but there was no need to do so.The performance of these laptops has far superseded an XPS gaming laptop that was given to me a couple years ago. It's an old model, but that should still say something about the Dell Latitude D630.It's slim and has a nice profile to it, easy to carry with you if you don't have a case.I have refurbished several of our old computers over the years so my advice to those that have had a bad experience with this laptop is that they *are* refurbished. When companies refurbish a computer, they go through and test to see what needs replaced and they replace it or fix it, wipe the drive (or stick a new one in), maybe clean it up a bit, and you have a refurbished computer. Considering the age of the model, there are surely things that will wear out or break much sooner than you would expect from a brand new computer. The lids, keyboards, mouse buttons, and whatnot are guaranteed to have some wear and scratches, it may or may not arrive looking sparkly and new.  Buying refurbished most likely means that calling the manufacturer will do no good for support, as it is no longer under their warranty. Purchasing a refurbished, one should expect these things and set their expectations accordingly. It is not a brand new computer.All in all, the Dell Latitude D630 is a nice little working computer. It makes a perfect gift for kids, or anyone that just wants a decent laptop, but not want to spend a fortune.  The price is good too - I've looked for months for something and found this to be the best bargain.I would definitely recommend this laptop!", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "Work Horse", "ReviewID": "R2LWM99G8OIKQD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I,ve been a pc tech for 20 years and my dell d630 is awsome the keyboard is a little worn but got one off of amazon for 18 dollars also i added 4gb of ram.

My reason for getting a refurbished computer is because I wanted to continue to use Windows XP and this was a way to get a \"new\" computer that still used XP.  I also wanted to still be able to use my old programs and hardware that are still compatible with XP.  I refuse to use Vista, and Windows 7 is marginal but I don't like it and it's not compatible with a few of my programs.  Out of the box it worked perfectly.  Unfortunately it only worked perfectly for about a month.  Now I can see why it was sent back to Dell.  It will randomly crash and shut down, and now that I have owned it for several months, it's too late to return it to Amazon.  Don't bother with a refurbished computer.  Just go get a new one with a full warranty.

Goode \"JBG\"", "ReviewID": "R36YF950DVSQSP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my first refurbished laptop about 5-6 years ago because it was inexpensive and I typically use it on trips so if it gets stolen I wouldn't lose a new laptop. But I had a very good experience with it so I've continued to buy refurbished ones for other members of my family when I see good ones at a good price.And this Dell D630 is the case. The condition of my D630 is very good. The keyboard looks new and there's no dust on it. There are some scratches on the bottom of the case but I can live with that. Every refurbished computer will be different though so you mileage will vary. It really depends on how the last corporate users used it. If it's a low usage computer, then you've got a good deal.Function: It's got a Core2Duo processor, which is newer than the Pentiums but older than the new iCores. It still has 2 CPU's in it. I upgraded mine to 4GB RAM (one of the cheapest and best way to upgrade your laptop) and the OS to Windows7 64-bit. RAM is so cheap nowadays I automatically upgrade all of my computers to the max, but do it yourself as it's often cheaper than having the vendor do it. Even with Windows7, this runs very fast. I use this mainly for surfing, but even with multiple browsers and multiple tabs running, this thing is fast.Right now, I'm very satisfied with it, especially at the refurbished price.If you can get a good price, go for it. If something is really worn out or needs replacing sometimes a complaint to the vendors may solve your problem, but if they won't, getting replacement parts is pretty cheap too, you can find replacements all over the internet.

You know that you have something which you value when you are thinking about getting a similar one as a spare-not because you feel the one in your hands it unreliable-because you know that accidents do happen, and you would hate to be without something this efficient for an extended period of time. I purchased one two years ago at what I considered to be a good price, and I just got another one because to me the price was sooo right. They are both performing superbly.One word of caution though: In buying computers-new or old, but especially old, yopu want to try and make sure that you know exactly what you are getting for your money. I wish that amazon would require of their vendors that they post more complete descriptions when it comes to something like a computer, which carries a big price tag and does include many details and components/parts. However, since they don't, make it a point to contact the potential vendor by email with some direct questions before making a purchase. Just because the general product description says one thing does not guarantee that it applies to the one you are buying. Case in point: my second laptop came with a 60GB harddrive, even though in the general description for the Dell 630 laptop, it says an 80GB harddrive. This is still fine by me, because 60 GB from my point of view and my needs, is still substantial, and the device does include all of the features which prompted me to make the purchase in the first place.

I bought this from Red Tag on Amazon and he sent me a good laptop and I've had only a couple small problems. Like the Windows Office included was only a Trial version--not what I wanted. I paid extra for that a 2 extra MB of RAM--the RAM is fine. I left 5 stars because it's a nice clean unit and works well. Pre-sale communication was good, but post sale was erratic. Red Tag has 100% positive feedback.The big thing you have to consider when buying a refurb is price vs value to you. Sure the refurbs are cheaper, but not that much cheaper when you consider that for an extra hundred +/- you can get a brand new laptop, never before used with a 1 year warranty. After looking I see many of the refurbs are way overpriced and I should have bought a new one with new technology.That hundred bucks I may have saved may come back to bite me. Any problems and one little repair will be over $100 so you may want to shop around before you buy a refurb. There are better refurb prices too out there--I discovered later. Next time I'll buy a new laptop, just for the newer technology, warranty, and no prior use. Some of these refurbs and used are way too expensive. Look around the internet first.
