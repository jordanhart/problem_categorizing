I was contacted back immediately with a return label and instructions, along with a note from the seller.  I shipped the computer back, they sent us a replacement and it started right up with no problems.  My grandson is ecstatic with it!  I think the operative word here is \"immediately\".

Melendez", "ReviewID": "R1URC7REA2AHYR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hello.Usually don't buy \"full-size\" laptops anymore (really like the battery life and usability of netbooks) but a few months ago I wanted something more powerful to run/play movies and maybe some light gaming. So decided on buying a lappy with a decent processor/gpu and most of them were actually quite expensive then... enter Gateway NV52L23u!!For the price you get a very decent CPU (AMD Quad Core Processor), with 6GB of RAM, 750GB hard Disk, etc. but more surprising is the \"video card\" output. Since this is a Trinity CPU, it comes with a Radeon HD 7640G embedded and I have to say I was very surprised with its performance. Installed Steam, played a few games (of course it doesn't play them in the highest settings but I'm good with it!) and it performed admirably!The only cons against it... Battery life is not that hot. If I can get 4 to 5 hours of continuous use, it's a miracle (and this is with lower brightness settings). My netbook yields like 10 hours or so with it's 6cell battery. I know I know, netbooks don't drain nor use components as power hungry as bigger laptops, but still, I was so used to that... As far as I know, there is not a bigger battery for this laptop. Also, some performance seem to be sluggish. Running Firefox with multiple tabs is a chore, strangely, Chrome runs EXCELLENT! Go figure. Finally WiFi seems to hit some snags sometimes (signal related) but it's not so bad.All in all, for the price I paid (which was LESS than $300... i.e. that's netbook pricing!) I LOVE IT!Looks good, performs well, no problems so far == Happy Customer!Thanks.", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "AMAZING", "Author": "Randall McGaw", "ReviewID": "R40ZHNJR6RMA1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It got here before it was scheduled to be here.

The processor and as well as the graphics card is...alright, but not as good as it could be. But, when it comes to some gaming and as well as some operation systems. It is a very good choice to pick. But, like all computers you cannot let it sit on the charger, it will quickly die in within a month, and it will leave you needing to buy a new battery. Never run this laptop like it is a desktop, it will burn and fry the components, like the ram and video card. Keep Gaming looks (Resolution) in the medium rang.
