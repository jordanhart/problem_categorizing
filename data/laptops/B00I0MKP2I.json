{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Laptop with Excellent Performance", "Author": "Paul \"wds\"", "ReviewID": "R38SLLUSIRZJ8T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have lot of good things to say about this HP Laptop.What is so good?(1) Slim looking with 6GB of RAM(2) Processor speed is reasonably good(3) HR Screen gives best of visual experiences(4) HDMI Port (just plug and play)(5) 750GB Hard Drive(6) YouCam is cool and video quality is superb(7) 3 USB ports(8) Audio from the built-in speaker produces excellent output(9) Excellent cooling system, and this laptop will run continuously without heating up and without any auto-shutdown. What is bad?(1) Battery capacity is so low that keeps the system on for just under 4 hours (max.).(2) Keyboard Layouts-the Function Keys (F1 - F12) are written in superscript. The dedicated up and down arrow keys are  smaller tinier than the right and left arrow keys causing very uncomfi. In order to use the function keys, you MUST first press the FN  button (bottom row of the keyboard) to enable it before using it. Otherwise, default HP settings like screen brightness, etc will take effect. The 'break' key is nowhere to be seen on the keyboard.  For programmers, this is very awkward.(3) No recovery CD/DVD or any other media comes with the Laptop and you need to make your own Recovery discs/DVDs.  In order to create a system recovery disk, it requires 5 DVDs or USB Flash Drive with minimum capacity of 20GB.  Each DVD takes around 30 minutes to burn.  Some of the DVDs abort in the middle.  These recovery discs can be created ONLY ONCE.(4) The power cord plug-in good with L-Shape, but does not hold tight at the port, and needs push in time to time to keep stay in place.(5) Body material quality has been little compromised and feels  light and weak.(6) Last but not the least, if you would like to record the screen using YouCam with self inset video for documentary purpose, you need to upgrade the software at extra cost.I like this HP laptop and will surely recommend this to friends.

So, after a month of aggravation, I am satisfied, as I always have been with an HP, but I had to research it on the internet for a solution.A couple of weeks later, I am not too enamored with this computer.  It keeps shutting down, unexpectedly; am working with HP, via on-line, to see if this can be corrected.  A couple of hours today and then it shut down, again, tonight.

I had some problems getting rid of unwanted  programs, such as Optimizer Pro, which came already on my computer.  I also had trouble setting up Google as my homepage.  After talking on the phone with a tech support man from Microsoft, my problems are solved.  He also helped me set up my email account.", "Date": "May 5, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00I0MKP2I"}}
