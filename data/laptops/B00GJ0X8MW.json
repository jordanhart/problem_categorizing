The new design is a slight variation on the last.  The screen upgrades, and hardware upgrades help push the performance of this lighter new model.  The biggest problem with this machine is the touchpad.  It is terrible.  I am not able to use the keyboard without my hands hitting the touchpad over and over.

Very lightweight. Design is conservative and practical.This model has the FHD (1920x1080) IPS non-touchscreen display, which is quite nice. I've had absolutely no issues with ghosting or bleed-through.---------------------------Update 3/24/14 -I've been using this for a few months now, and I am still quite pleased. To address concerns raised by other reviewers:-Bleedthrough / ghosting: with the 1920x1080 IPS non-touchscreen, I have seen NO sign of either of these problems.-Touchpad: The lack of dedicated buttons for the touchpad is a little annoying, however I don't see it as a significant drawback. Lots of people complain about accidentally hitting the touchpad when typing, and I can't imagine how they're doing this. Resting my palms where they're meant to go, I can't even hit the touchpad if I try. So... sounds like YMMV, and it really depends on your typing posture.-Design and durability: I have had ZERO issues with the design or durability. Yes, this model lacks a clasp for locking the screen shut during transport, but the hinges are set such that it takes extra effort to go from \"closed\" to \"open\", as compared to adjusting the screen angle when already open. Others have complained about the quality of materials-- again, I don't see what they're complaining about. This model feels very rigid, and I can't bend the frame or body panels even if I try. If it sounds \"thin\" when you tap on it-- that's because it IS, that's how they save weight. But I am confident that quality has not been sacrificed.Anyway, that's my two cents' worth. So far so good, and I remain certain that I would buy this exact model again.", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Better than expected", "Author": "Eric O.", "ReviewID": "R3J0UHDXMWN0FN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was very hesitant about purchasing this new T440S due to a fair amount of negative reviews floating around the web. I have had laptops from HP, Dell, Asus, Sony and Samsung in the past, however, they all lack the one feature I can't live without at this moment. That feature is the absolutely FANTASTIC Ultra Dock. Seriously, no other mfg comes close with a product offering, and if they did, their screen resolution is still maxed out at 1600 x 900. Seriously, lets get with the times. Since most of the poor reviews were in regards to the newly designed touch-pad, I figured I'd give it a shot. I'm actually VERY pleasantly surprised with how wrong I feel the other reviewers were. I think the touch-pad is absolutely brilliant. It works flawlessly for me. It is predictable and precise. The screen is stunning, with EXCELLENT touch recognition. The battery longevity is at a typical 14 - 15 hours for me. The processor is a top-notch i7, which is a powerful workhorse while remaining energy efficient. The drive is an Intel SSD, so good luck trying to beat that. The keyboard is OUTSTANDING. It's like typing on a Logitech chiclet, which is my favorite style, allowing me the fewest typos. The weight to structural-rigidity ratio is almost unbelievable. It is both light, and still very rigid. At no point have I ever found myself thinking, \"I hope I don't crack the case by picking it up by the edge\".  The fingerprint reader flat out just works.  Maybe I have good skin, or perhaps my fingerprints are special (Yes, they are also unique).  Whatever the case, I'm glad it wasn't an added cost with no benefit.  The AC wireless card works perfectly, never any hiccup or stutter.  To wrap it up, the only difficulty I had with this purchase was trying to get Lenovo to sell it to me for the correct advertised price. If those issues hadn't occurred, I'd have gladly associated this product with a perfect 5-star review. In the end, I'll gladly recommend the Lenovo brand to my friends, family, and colleagues, as it offers a true solution to the mobile-meets-desktop environment. Due to my many frustrations during the purchasing of this product, I can't rate it as perfect. It is unfortunate but necessary. I hope that my future involvement with Lenovo Sales is smoother and more enjoyable.", "Date": "April 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Poor ergonomics with the new integrated trackpad and abysmal customer support.", "Author": "Jeremy H.", "ReviewID": "R1D66JCLWY6W47", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought my T440s via the lenovo website as I've been a long time customer and love the thinkpad line.However, I just can't tolerate the new integrated trackpad as it requires awkard thumb and wrist rotations to press the trackpoint buttons.  Especially right clicks. This gives me a sore hand after a short time.  I think it is a step backward from the more traditional separate buttons.I've also had 2 major faults with my machine in the 4 months I've owned it. The first required a memory replacement (that took 3 weeks to fix) and the second needs a system board replacement.Lenovo have had my machine for nearly 8 weeks now and there is still no ETA on a fix. They say that parts are not available.I've asked lenovo for a refund on march 20th (22 days ago) but each time I call them they say they will escalate my request but nothing happens.Lenovo support have promised to call me back around 15 times so far  --- they have called me back just once.What lenovo says, and what they do are completely different.I've now initiated legal action against lenovo to obtain a refund.It disappoints me hugely as I've always liked thinkpads.The reason for my rating is partly due to the poor trackpad ergonomics , and mostly due to the awful amount of time they take to repair faults.If you want a lenovo , consider that if something goes wrong they may take 2 months or more to repair.", "Date": "April 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent machine: fast, light, high-quality, super battery life", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R58PICT1LSJMM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my machine for a month--enough time to appreciate it and also enough time to see if any of the so-called defects were of any concern. I am completely satisfied with the purchase. I suspect that the skewed distribution of reviews reflects that fact that most of these machines are bought for businesses that might be buying direct from Lenovo and not buying them through Amazon.I own a small consulting business and needed to replace my 5+ year-old laptop, also a Lenovo. The T440s is the one that has the classic full Lenovo keyboard--the one that makes you forget you are on a laptop. The screen is bright, resolution excellent. The processor is super fast--I went for the 06HUS configuration with the i-7 processor and the solid state hard drive. I have dozens of programs and receive huge quantities of e-mail--all load before I have time to think or do anything else. I don't need a touchscreen and my IT person pushed the idea of staying with Windows 7--you really only need Windows 8 if you are going the touchscreen route.I am not an expert on the construction of laptops, but the fit feels solid. The lack of a close-latch looms large when you write it, but the practical impact is zero. The laptop stays close--it will only open when you want it too. If anything, you may be a bit annoyed initially by the unfamiliar prying grip needed to open it.  The laptop is definitely light and thin--there are ones that are even lighter and thinner, but at some point this seems more about bragging rights than practicality--I doubt anyone needs a laptop with this level of features to be any lighter.Finally, seems like I need to address the touchpad. It is not much different than my old Lenovo, where the left and right buttons were separate and slightly raised. In this design, they are smooth and incorporated in the touchpad, but rest at the same spot and need to be activated with a similar touch as if they were visually and physically separate. Yes, I occasionally miss the spot, but less so over a fairly short period of time that I have been getting used to the machine.Meantime, the price has dropped even further than a month ago, when I thought I had gotten a great deal.", "Date": "April 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "How do I love thee? Let me count the ways ...", "Author": "Andrew D. Royappa", "ReviewID": "RUMVOMPXHC0R9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was in the market for a new laptop for school and came across this. Perhaps a bit oddly, my school requires students' laptops to meet certain performance specs (8 GB RAM, 64 bit OS, to name a few); this laptop fit the bill at least in that respect. Also, I liked that it was Windows 7, as I have no interest whatsoever in Windows 8. I figured a SSD would fit my needs because I really don't need much space. This laptop was in my price range, so I pulled the trigger.Looking around at what other people said, the major issue I expected to have was with the touchpad. Pretty much universally, people had terrible things to say about it. I fully expected it to be unusable and planned on getting a mouse.Well, the laptop came in a few days ago and I've spent hours on it since. To my great surprise, the touchpad is ... almost perfect. It's quick, responsive, and with a nice matte finish, very smooth. My favorite feature is gesture scrolling (slide two fingers on the pad to scroll) - I can't imagine living without it. Clicking is a breeze, except for right clicks. It's a bit persnickety, but not impossible. I fail to see what all the fuss is about.The trackpoint button in the middle is fine I guess, about as awkward as every trackpoint I've ever tried. I find it completely unusable.This laptop boots in 30 seconds, from shut down to logged in. Hence, I am a great fan of the SSD. iTunes, Chrome, etc. boot in approximately 1 second (I am not kidding). Time will tell if it remains that fast, but I expect it will. The keyboard is really, really nice. The keys are raised making it way easy to type on. It's also quite portable, about the size of a large book. Light, too.Now, what don't I like about it? For starters, there's no CD/DVD drive. I suppose that's why it weighs 3.5 lbs and is 0.8\" thick, but I dunno, it'd be nice to have. If you absolutely must have a CD drive, check out the cousin of the T440s, the T440p. This one's got no HDMI port, for reasons unknown. 14\" is a little small, but I think I'll get used to it. With such high resolution on a small screen, I initially had a bit of difficulty reading text. Some adjustments in Windows 7 and Chrome have fixed that. Lastly, it would be nice if there were indicator lights of some sort to see if it's thinking about something, or just hung. I did have some issues initially with it freezing occasionally on startup or shutdown, but those have gone away.Overall: this is a spectacular little laptop. Light, portable, great to type on, wicked fast. I'm quite pleased.And no, I don't work for Lenovo.", "Date": "May 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Solid laptop with a few rough edges", "Author": "Justin \"E\"", "ReviewID": "R2T6VAR47NQ74V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The first thing I did when this laptop arrived was reformat it to run Linux, so I can't really comment on whether it does the sort of things people allegedly want Windows for.Hardware wise, the laptop seems good, with a few caveats after a couple weeks of use:- Overall build quality is solid.  The body has a bit of a hollow sound if you tap it (I think other reviewers noted this), but there's absolutely no deflection or bend to the case at all, even when held from a corner.  The laptop is surprisingly light for the size.- I would strongly suggest that you look into getting a unit with an i5 processor and perhaps upgrade the HDD to SSD yourself.  With the i7 version, I only see battery life in about the 7-8 hour range under ordinary use, and probably less than 2 hours if the i7 really spins up.  The performance difference is negligible, so I wish I'd been able to find an i5 unit for extra battery life.- If you actually need performance (to do engineering work, for example), then the dual core ultrabook-class processor in this unit will simply not suit you i7 or not, and you should look at something like the T440p instead.- The screen is good, though it seems more semi-gloss than matte.  The anti-glare coating is effective in bright light.- The screen is one of the few available without some horrible touch-screen trash glued to it.  This means the laptop is lighterand the screen isn't glossy, so double-plus on the screen being good.  It's one of the /only/ good ones.  I would have bought an X240 instead, in fact, except that model is only available in glossy.- The backlight on the keyboard shines straight into your eye when viewed from the side.  I generally just leave it off.- The keyboard itself, on the other hand, is GREAT.  Much better than other laptop keyboards.  The only mildly annoying bit is that if you want to swap the top row to be function keys by default, the FnLk LED will always be lit (even when swapped in the BIOS).  Also, the Fn key is in the wrong place, but you can swap it with Ctrl in the BIOS.  This seems like a minor problem compared to the Carbon X1, which doesn't have working function keys at all, though.- The Mini DisplayPort is good, but the lack of an HDMI port is unfortunate.  I find the VGA port useless.  I don't have the optional docking station, so I don't know how well that works.- The two-battery design seems to work well.  I like having the option of buying the 6-cell upgrade battery.And now (drumroll) the big one: the touchpad that other reviewers unanimously hate:The touchpad is... OK, actually.  Not great, but OK.It requires manual reconfiguration of the Synaptics driver to work acceptably in Linux because it's a new design, but I rather like it compared to other clickpads (such as the model in the Dell XPS 13).  I like that the whole pad depresses under my finger, and having three raised dots at the top is great because it gives me a middle mouse button I can find by feel (yay!).  Most other laptops are basically hopeless if you want a middle-click.  Granted, making the top of the pad work right in Linux wasn't the default, but the setting was easy.  No idea how well that works in other operating systems.The main downside with the touchpad is that palm detection seems to be absolutely broken.  This might be a driver issue, but from the sound of other reviews it seems like perhaps not.  To mitigate this, I just assigned a keyboard shortcut to turn tap-to-click on and off, and switch to using physical pressure when I need to type accurately.  It's a compromise, but overall it works better than most laptops for me.  In any case, I think I'd still want the shortcut if palm detection worked, since palm detection always fails when you need it most.The trackpoint (the tiny eraser-shaped joystick) doesn't seem like it provides a lot of value, but I do occasionally use it for precise control.There were a few other issues which seem like they were probably Linux driver issues:- The fingerprint reader is difficult to find drivers for and seldom works.- I've had stability issues with the Intel WLAN card.- I've also had some occasional stability issues with the OEM Samsung SSD drive, which might be power management related.- Bluetooth also seems pretty poor, but I'm sure this is a driver issue.Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with this laptop.  It isn't the prettiest, and I would have preferred a 12-13\" size if an acceptable model was available, but in general it works well.  The biggest downside is that it's rather expensive (similar in price to a MacBook Pro, which comes with a much stronger processor), but you're paying extra for a keyboard and a screen that actually work.", "Date": "April 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Had 2 Nearly Identical Thinkpad T440s's: Somewhat different quality", "Author": "Weili Cheng", "ReviewID": "R3254VXF5DLKTB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have have one T440s for personal use and another one for work both identical (OS, RAM, CPU, wireless card etc...) except for the display. My personal laptop has maxed out specifications for display with wide viewing angles while my work Thinkpad did not. There actually is a difference here when you move the screen around, the IPS display is very continuous while for the non-IPS you can see bands of black as you tilt it backwards.Despite being identical, my work t440s has problems turning on and off which never occurs in my personal t440s. Sometimes, when you turn it on, after loading the windows logo the screen blacks out just before the log in window and freezes. The same happens when turning off the machine. This is quite annoying as it takes multiple iterations to turn on the machine and can also happen when the machine falls asleep. Had I only received this laptop, I would have given this a 2 star rating.My personal t440s has been excellent and I've had no problems whatsoever. I've had this laptop for ~3 months now and its still good as new. I actually really enjoyed the trackpad and often use the multi touch gestures. I've also accidentally spilled water on the keyboard + trackpad and the laptop still works perfectly.
