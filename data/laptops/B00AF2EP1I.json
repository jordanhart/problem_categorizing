The Windows 8 is really neat for organizing the programs you have open.  It's easy to manage. I use this computer and run 4-5 large programs at a time and it is extremely fast!  The tech man at my school recommended this specific computer since it has a 4core and I'm so glad I went with this one.

It brings the temp down about 10c and runs faster.Also if you use something like Razr Game Booster, or something that will allow you to close down background services it will improve your gaming.CONS:Only thing I do not like is the screen. I edit photos and I feel if I dont have the screen at a perfect 90degrees, the colors and lightness/darkness in pictures changes. So I dont feel I can get an accurate edit of the photo.Maybe I will upgrade to an HD monitor to pair with this laptop", "Date": "April 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Programers beware", "Author": "Hannahzarah Avarraschild \"Hannah\"", "ReviewID": "R1G5NKJL2997VH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The keyboard of this laptop doesn't have a pause/break key.

(Cannot maintain near 2.8 GHz)", "Author": "Joy Feliz Tait", "ReviewID": "R1WO9X5A02GJDZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A great deal, but not nearly as stellar as I thought it would be.Make sure you know how an AMD Accelerated processor/CPU works; it cannot maintain it's max accelerated speed (assuming it can reach it) for any significant length of time.  Mine seems to be able to maintain about 2.2 GHz or so (maybe ~2.4) when ventilated well (it slows down if objects are close to the vents).  Also, I recommend knowing what you're getting into when you get Windows 8.(the following 3 paragraphs are really about Windows 8, so feel free to skip them and move on to \"I was reluctant...\")I've had this computer (and Windows 8) for over a month, and from my experience, Windows 8 saves itself by supposedly having anything that works on Windows 7 work also on Windows 8 (Though it seems to meet this goal quite well, I'm experiencing some or several difficulties (mostly online) that would not be occurring with Windows 7).It seems Windows 8 is not really a big step forward, and tries to envelope Windows 7 inside it so it has a fallback anywhere needed, which is very important since it seems to me that most Windows 8 programs are premature/underdeveloped (or don't exist for Windows 8 yet); I just install and use the Windows 7 versions.  (Skype is a great example, as the Windows 8 version's functionality is (or was) poor (signal loss issues and poor video) and very limited, but I haven't had Skype problems after installing Windows 7 Skype and uninstalling Windows 8 Skype.With that said, aside from little issues here and there, Windows 8 does seem quite user friendly (in perspective of how complicated they/computers are).I was reluctant to give 5 stars (primarily) because the biggest selling point advantage this computer had for me was the quad 2.8GHz that I thought I could set the computer to consistently run at, or that the computer would run at whenever there was enough demand; and that turned out to be false.  I felt like giving only 2 stars after learning that, but it was my own misunderstanding; I'm generally happy with the computer, and wouldn't have been able to get a much better deal elsewhere online at the time (I did my research) for the price (my purchase on approx. Jan. 11th, 2013 totaled $498 w/shipping).The only other complaint of any significance I can think of is difficulty with the touchpad reading my fingers properly sometimes, but that might be a personal problem instead of the product; I'm not sure which.  Everything else seems to work great.This review was written by my husband, who chose and uses the computer practically every day (usually for several hours), and who is a fairly advanced computer user.", "Date": "February 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "great laptop!", "Author": "Austin", "ReviewID": "R1JDEDAO2VWXAX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "with a amd a8 and a 17 inch screen, this laptop is great. keeping it for a long time. the company is great too and helped me out alot", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hp Compaq  with AMD Quad-Core A8 processor", "Author": "Partha Bhadra", "ReviewID": "RMGGM5OCQE865", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very good laptop computer with heavy duty computing power.
