{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Do not even think of Toshiba", "Author": "Sam", "ReviewID": "R1XP88G9B0XIXP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "HelloI generally do not write reviews. However this particular product and the whole experience with Toshiba customer service has forced me to voice my concern.I bought this laptop since it was cheap and loaded with many features. I had other options at the same price but i went with Toshiba because of company's reputation.OK here is my experience;I bought the laptop and brought it home. After 2-3 days it started giving me blue screen error(some hardware issue). Later On the laptop started to freeze without any reason. It came to a point that it started freezing every minute or so.I could not return it because it was already past 30 days.So first i searched google for known issues with this laptop. I was surprised to see that lot of people had the same problem. Somehow there was a faulty hardware in this particular lot that was shipped. It was sad to see that company was still selling this.Anyway i called Toshiba Support Center to get it repaired (it has one year warranty). It seems the support center already knew the issue with the laptop. They told me right away to ship it to there repair location. I was happy that they are familiar with the issue. Ok here is the fun part; they told me to ship the laptop to there location at my own expense, i.e. pay 25$ for laptop shipment. I tried to argue but they said its there policy. They know that they have shipped a faulty hardware with there laptop and now on top of that they are asking us to pay again for shipping it to get it repaired.Anyway atleast i was given a choice to ship it with whichever method i choose to. So i went to USPS and i paid 15$ to ship it via priority mail with a tracking number etc.Now i was trying to track my shipment with USPS to see if it has reached the repair location. Well,the USPS tried to deliver the laptop at there Louisville, KY repair location but there was nobody to receive it there. So USPS left a slip on there mail location to either schedule a re-delivery or pick it up.As per USPS's new policy they do not do an automatic redelivery attempt. The receiver has to call to schedule a redelivery or pick it up at the post office.Ofcourse i do not have a phone number for Toshiba's louisville repair center so that i can call them and ask them to schedule a redelivery; i called the Toshiba customer support center to see if they can help. To my surprise, they said since the laptop has not arrived at the repair location; it is not in there system so they can not help me with this. Instead of giving me alternative they hung up on me intentionally twice.Now my laptop is sitting in some post office in Louisville which will be delivered back to me if not picked up in 15 days (USPS will not schedule redelivery on sender's request).So basically , myself (the Toshiba customer) is going through unnecessary trouble for buying a faulty laptop. My only fault is that i bought this laptop because of Toshiba's reputation.Therefore please be careful when you buy Toshiba's products, particularly be aware of the support center.I am a big fan of everything Japanese; but this incident with Toshiba was surely not soothing.Thanks for reading this review.", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great product for School use.", "Author": "Ed", "ReviewID": "R2V04GYJBVVDT0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is perfect with battery life, size, weight, look, monitor quality, overall quality, AND the best part is its got a NumPad which is great if your used to desktop keyboards. Main thing I love about it is its battery life, 5 hours! Even more if you set it down to Power saving mode and run on low brightness, runs for about 6 hours if you're not heavy computing. Keyboard is SILENT and made of great quality. Monitor is the perfect size for a laptop this price. Hard drive space is PLENTY. RAM is plenty for regular usage! Only thing holding this baby back is its processor. It is a dual core AMD 1.3 GHz processor which is fairly slow. It plays HD video smoothly, plays 1080p without any problems. The problem comes up when doing heavy installations or running programs that eat up CPU resources. Other than that, it handles everything from schoolwork to browsing.", "Date": "July 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice full size keyboard with number pad", "Author": "P.

This laptop has a beautiful display and we've had no problems whatsoever with the hardware or software during the 6 weeks since we bought it. The only reason we did not give 5 stars is a lack of some small conveniences that we are used to in our older HP laptops, such as a HDD activity light and small buttons to quickly turn off the Wi-Fi connection, and the track pad since we favor an external mouse.", "Date": "May 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Laptop I've Ever Had", "Author": "Zyde \"zyde\"", "ReviewID": "R1NSM37K6VU2NV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was my first Toshiba computer purchase, so I was hesitant switching to a brand I wasn't familiar with.
