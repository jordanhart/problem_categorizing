I found the Satellite C875D-S7225 on sale at Office Depot and I've had this for almost a year.  Turns out I am very disappointed in this laptop.  It's actually slower than the seven year old Compaq I replaced, but most of all the keyboard is terrible.  I'm a fairly decent \"ten-finger\" typer, but I have to constantly check to see what I have typed because it seems like you have to hit the keys a certain way for them to register or it will register the letter as well as the one next to it, or double thhe letter or won' even enter the correct letter.  As an example, I will type the remainder of this review without going back to correct the keyboard errors.  The keyboard itself seems \"spriingy\" and letters either don't register or they double or sometimes even triple.  This is prticuly noticeable with the keys near the middle of the keyboard where the keyboard seems to be the mos flimsy.  The iintegrated numeric keyboard is pretty much uselss for me because of the inconsisteny of entering correc numbers - and a wrong number is not easily noticed.Additonally, the battery life is poor and lasts only about two hours of active use.  And when he 'low battery' warning coes on, giving me \"20 minutes remaining\", my laptop shuts down before I even have time to plug it in.Boot up time is slow, and onnecting to wifi is 'hit or miss'.This might be a good computer for someone who wants it for occaional emails and som basic inrnet surfing, but for wok-reated business (reports, spreasheets, etc.), frequent emails or other intensive computer use, ou might want to look for soething else.", "Date": "August 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "5 star satelite", "Author": "Pablo", "ReviewID": "R26O7RAZ6R904", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must say when I saw the box my laptop came in I was expeting a heavily used laptop.

But my own experience was not positive. Beside short battery life i find keyboard worst part of this computer. I use ten fingers to write. When writing a lot of times some characters will be skipped in words because buttons need to be fully pressed in the middle. i have no problem typing in any other computer but this one. Typing with keyboard is annoying . i decided to get ride of this computer and buy an other one as i need to reply a lot customers emails. I also noticed a lot of positive reviews i read before purchasing this computer were by professional review writers who do not use computer on daily basis, but taking a quick look at them and than writing fancy reviews as their full time job. Best review should come from actual customers.", "Date": "April 26, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B009AWDOLQ"}}
