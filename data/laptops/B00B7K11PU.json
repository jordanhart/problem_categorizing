I'm so glad I didn't get a laptop with a small 15 inch screen. Battery charges fast. There wasn't a lot of bloatware to remove. Asus has a nice smart gestures utility to suppress any Windows 8 gestures that become annoying. It is fast enough for my purposes and Asus has 24/7 support and 1 year warranty, plus 1 year accidental warranty. I didn't really want Windows 8, but that's what you're gonna get. After 3 weeks intensive training, I now am comfortable with Windows 8. The laptop has really fast wake-up from sleep (they are not kidding when they say 2 seconds). However, it runs warmer than I had expected when the charger is plugged in. On the negative side, there isn't a free period of Windows 8 support for complicated issues from either Asus or Microsoft due to being an OEM copy of Windows. That's probably typical. However, Microsoft will help with minor things free of charge.", "Date": "April 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "A sensible choice", "Author": "Joseph M. Deliso \"--max\"", "ReviewID": "R2XHLCKMZDDKUX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great machine for the price, but there are a few caveats.The hardware is, as usual with ASUS, of excellent quality. The frame is sturdy, the case is a stylish matte black with very understated ornamentation, which I like. The screen produces a surprisingly good looking display, and at 1600x900 it's compatible with standard widescreen media. At 17.3 inches it's just big enough to pull off 16:9 without being a burden on your eyes.  The keyboard's not great, but it's not terrible either. It's tough to be objective about these things when your main keyboard is mechanical. The hardware is mostly great, but there are two areas where it's somewhat deficient.The touchpad leaves a little to be desired. Clicking is very awkward because the left and right mouse buttons are both part of the same panel that you touch to manipulate the mouse. This means that you can still click even if your finger is near the top left hand side of the touchpad, and if you're like me you may do this often, and it may annoy you a lot. ASUS does bundle some software with the machine to do gesture recognition and try and make using the touchpad less painful, and to some extent it does work; they introduced some interesting and thoughtful shortcuts - but it's not enough. The touchpad itself is not sensitive enough to be fit for general use. The good news: if you just plug in a mouse, you don't have to deal with any of this. Also I would recommend using the ASUS configuration software to disable the touchpad when the mouse is plugged in.The other area where the machine is a little sub-par is the audio controller. It's an integrated VIA audio processing chip, and you may notice some noise in playback if you have quality audio hardware. This will worsen significantly if you use an application which attempts to play a bunch of sounds at the same time. Also, the 5mm audio port is reused for headphones and microphones, and sometimes the software fails to detect which is which. It's happened more than once where I plugged in my headphones only to receive an earful of noise. But, again, you can buy external audio playback equipment if this bothers you too much, so it's not a big problem either.The Intel integrated HD Graphics 3000 is more than adequate for everything that's not GPU intensive 3D applications, (read: recent games). The CPU is decently fast. Similar to the GPU, it's just powerful enough that you can do almost all things which fit the profile of modern 'typical use' i.e. web browsing, word processing, etc. without noticing any significant delay. Same goes for the size and speed of the available RAM. Also, if you really need more RAM you can buy some and install it yourself - there is an available slot. (I don't know what effect this will have on the warranty, but it probably won't be pretty). The HDD is not too snappy, but with all of the new boot optimizations in software, you'll barely notice.This brings me to the software. Like it or not, you have no choice in the matter, this system ships with Windows 8 pre-installed (the licensing fee contributes in some small way to the total price of the machine). This particular model does not come with a backup disk nor a means to create one easily, so if you mess up your install and do not know how to fix it then you are dependent on ASUS or a repair shop to fix it for you. They partition the one disk into four parts by default: EFI System, OS Recovery, OS Partition, and Data. The EFI system partition is used to  store specially signed boot images. The OS Recovery partition can be booted into to try and fix whatever is wrong with the OS Partition, and will load after the OS Partition itself fails to load. The Data partition is intended to be used to store, well, data (Music/Movies/Documents etc.). This system is one of many systems to use a new system for booting which obsoletes the old MBR/BIOS based approach, which has some important consequences for you, the consumer. Now, the vendors of the hardware have the power to decide what operating system will run on the device, as well as the power to prevent other operating systems from running. This functionality has been met with heavy opposition from global proponents of software freedom, and the legal and ethical debate continues. This particular system still allows the user to enter the firmware and disable the 'SecureBoot' functionality, but the process requires some technical acumen and is only required if you intend to replace Windows with certain other operating systems. Thusly, installing GNU/Linux on this machine is a little trickier than on the older BIOS based machines, but still possible. Failing that, the i3 2370M supports VT-x and so virtualization is an attractive option if you don't want to take a risk dabbling with the firmware.Aside from the boot concerns, transitioning to Windows 8 from Windows 7 or an earlier version of Windows can be a little jarring. The system seems to be more geared towards a touch sensitive device (which this laptop is not), and the typical user experience is vastly different from prior versions. Only after extensive reconfiguration and tinkering was I able to put the machine into a state that I was comfortable using, but that is of course very personal and your mileage may vary.I give the laptop four out of five stars: the hardware is mostly great but the software not so much. The frame, the general build quality, the screen, and the keyboard are good, but the touchpad and audio controller are a little lacking. The new firmware offers questionable benefit while taking away the consumer freedom, and Windows 8 is still not really suitable for a machine of this form.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Happy!!", "Author": "bmcallisterx", "ReviewID": "RPCJIAVSZKWB0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not sure why one of the reviews says the computer is slow - I was impressed with the performance.

But would I buy it again? No, not if I could afford to spend more. I bought this to replace my Dell 1720 Inspiron.Here's the thing: If you only have five hundred bucks to spend, this is a good buy. But you're going to hate the trackpad with a passion. It's probably the worst design, ever. The bottom portion of the pad is the Left and Right buttons, (it's all one piece,) and it is super stiff, (you really have to press hard,) and the tracking is hyper sensitive, so when you press on the buttons/pad the pointer will usually shoot off to another part of the screen other than what you wanted to click on. So you're really going to have to master the various types of finger taps. There is no native settings app. for the trackpad, so forget about adjusting it.Second is the keyboard. For a 17\" laptop, the keyboard layout/size is much more like a 15\". That sucks if you're a fast typer, like me. The spacebar will be the next bane of your existence after the trackpad. You really have to hit that sucker. If you don't, you're going to look up to find just one big line of text.Having looked at the field of 17\" laptops in this price range, I still think this is a good buy. You just need to understand what you're getting into with the pad and keyboard. The pad is not, 'un-workable', it's just going to take some getting used to.

Battery life is so-so, for me about 3 hrs,  but not a problem as I went with this size laptop knowing I'm not going to be hauling it around with me very much.

I recently \"upgraded\" from a 3 year old HP and this thing runs slower out of the box than my HP ever did. Even scrolling through a word document is a bit like swimming through molasses. In writing this, I honestly cannot think of any good thing about this laptop. Not even one. I've heard that ASUS is a good computer brand, perhaps a step up from HP, Dell, Toshiba, etc., but I can't think that anymore.What specifically is wrong with it? First things first, the speakers are mounted on the bottom of the computer. That's right, the bottom. Now I don't know about you, but I definitely don't have ears on my legs. Or my desk. Or my couch. The mouse gestures are ill conceived and non-intuitive. Turning them off makes using it a tad less infuriating, however the \"buttons\" are integrated into the trackpad itself and not fully separate so right clicking is a giant pain. I mentioned the scrolling before, but it's not limited to word documents. It's everything. Everything is sluggish, even typing this review. I play a few flash based games online in my free time and my old laptop could run them at 40 fps no problem. This thing runs the same game at about 17 fps. It's got 4 gigs of ram, but it doesn't feel like it. Also the HDD is 5400 rpm, exceedingly slow too. And then there's Windows 8. It'd probably be ok for something with a touch screen, but this is a laptop, so it's pretty annoying to use.All in all, I'm disappointed in this laptop, and I fully regret purchasing this product. I'll be sure to stay away from ASUS in the future, and I'm not looking forward to spending the next 2 or so years with this thing. It's been less than a month and I already want to chuck it out in the yard. I would, if it weren't for my budget.Buy something else.EDIT: After still using this laptop for a few months, I have a few things to add. I still think the bottom mounted speakers is just really really bad design. I've disabled the mouse gestures so the trackpad is at least usable, but right clicking while intending to left click and vice versa is still an issue. For some reason, putting the computer to sleep and waking it up seems to speed the computer up. The scroll lag is gone, and so is the flash player lag after doing this, even right after fully powering on. Win 8 is still bad, but that's not Asus's fault. And the headphone jack, which I did not mention in my initial review, but it doubles as a microphone jack. Thing is, every time you plug something into it, it asks, \"is this a microphone or headphones?\" It also always has the choice defaulted to microphone, because the more common thing people plug into their laptops is definitely a microphone. It would be nice if it defaulted to headphones automatically, or even just assumed such, and you had to change it manually to microphone, since most people would rarely plug in a mic to their laptop (especially a 2.5 mm jacked mic). But the biggest thing that brought me here to add this edit, screws are falling out of the laptop. I should specify that I have not opened the case, nor have any of my screwdrivers ever touched any screws on this laptop. Yet, I find that there is nothing now securing the panel over the HDD and the RAM. Yikes. This is most definitely not a minor concern or issue. I still don't recommend this laptop to anyone, but it's not wholly terrible (but it's close).
