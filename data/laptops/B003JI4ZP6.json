Not leaving it on surfaces that it shouldn't be on (couches, cloth, etc) or not using cooler pads and running very hard games might cause over heating. Mine personally has never overheated. I run alot of things at the same time, and the computer is always super stable and never hangs up. This laptop has a very nice, sturdy design. It is rather heavy but I also feel like I could run it over with my car and it would still be ok. I like the customizable lights, the design, the durability, and the specs. I have not had a problem running anything on this laptop that I have wanted to.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "alienware", "Author": "punxxi \"punxxi\"", "ReviewID": "R1QWMV7KU1OI4G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have never had a problem with my  Alienware M 17 X laptop overheating or any other problems that I haven't caused myself.

I'm trying to get a few more months of use out of it before I take a hammer to it and then set it on fire.I'm not very tech savvy and I'm not a gamer but I spend a lot of time online. I wanted the fastest laptop available for that simple task so I ordered the Cadillac version of the M17x which set me back nearly $4,000. For that much money, the thing should perform flawlessly even if you drop it off a cliff.Since I've owned this POS, I've gone through three power cords, spent approximately 30 hours on the phone with Dell \"support\", had three different service visits to replace the motherboard and other components.Despite all that, the M17x overheats causing random shutdowns every hour or two. Two or three times a day the screen will just go blank and I'll have to do a forced shutdown and restart. It's ridiculous.You would be wise to not chalk my experience up to getting a random lemon. Too many others here and elsewhere have had the same or similar experiences.The bottom line is that Dell/Alienware are putting out outrageously overpriced pieces of junk. If you buy one, there is an excellent chance you'll hate yourself for it.And if the thing needs to sit on a cooling pad or in a meat freezer to work properly, sell it with a cooling pad or a meat freezer.My actual rating is negative 5 stars.", "Date": "May 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Expensive Doorstop!!!!!!", "Author": "Billy smith", "ReviewID": "R3CAMW5H2XTYJG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Over priced piece of junk!!!
