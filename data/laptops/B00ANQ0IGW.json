The size is perfect. Without optical drive , it saves a lot of space . And I just need to get an external drive for it $30 . Di not have to carry a huge backpack with heavy laptop all the time. Fast , run great . Screen is wonderful, bright. , beautiful outside and inside. Love window 8. Just one week to get used to it, and much superior than win7", "Date": "March 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good but off", "Author": "Peyton Sheeler", "ReviewID": "R2OJTYMZEDW0D8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It came very quick and was everything promised but the same day i got it I started having problems with it, even will have to take it to best buy soon...", "Date": "August 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00ANQ0IGW"}}
