{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nvidia chip unreliable ask for an intel video unit", "Author": "Chai", "ReviewID": "R86C05WXS4M1H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my third D630, I love many things about it, but this unit came with a bad graphics chip. My old ones had Intel graphics. This one, however, has an Nvidia quadro video chip. I knew they were not well designed and Nvidia use to change the gpu for free in afected models, but the period for claims is over. I thought that a well rated vendor like 199 computers would only sell good quality items so I gave the unit a shoot, thinking that the unit would had been previously sent to nvidia for a gpu replacement. My mistake.My previous d630 were great, but this one could not deal with simple video tasks. If the temperature goes a little higher, the system freezes. I noticed that when the 30 days period of guaranty was finished, so I did not contact the seller. I bought an used DT781 mother board with intel graphics instead and I replaced the R872J. Now everithing is fine, but I spent 80 bucks more :(THE GOOD: -It comes with windows 7 32-bits home premium edition ($65.00 for itself).  -The biometric device is prety rare in d630 models (that is why I decided to change the Mother Board).  -The docking station is a very nice touch. You can dock the laptop in 2 seconds and keep working.  -It has a dvd burner instead of a combo drive.  -A 2.2 Ghz processor (really fast)  -360 bluetooth, instead of the slower 350 unit (most of refurb don't even have one).  -They include reinstalation disk for windows 7 and another for the drivers.  -The computer was barely used (I think it's been stored, because according to dell it was shipped 5 years ago).  -I have also changed the hard disk drive for a ssd and upgraded to 8 gb in ram: it is really easy to custom.The bad: -The Nvidia Video Chip: 199 computer guys, don't ship it anymore (I can not believe you do not know about the problem).  -Memmory in use is smaller than the memory installed with a 32 bits operative system (3.5 gb instead of 4).  -To use all the memmory installed up to 8 gb you have to upgrade to windows 7 64 bits (100 bucks).  -The charger is cheap, I use it only with the docking station because I don't trust it for everiday use.  -They don't mention any information about the video chip in the description.The bottom line: Contact the seller to request for an intel video motherboard before placing your order. The d630 is an amazing laptop, but you have to be sure the motherboard gpu is Intel or a Nvidia fixed one.", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great for everyday use", "Author": "Amy", "ReviewID": "R1ZTSDFLWZPNOP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this computer several months ago to replace an older Dell laptop the always crashed.
