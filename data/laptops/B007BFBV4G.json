Steinhoff", "ReviewID": "RU01I4K5IHGET", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop at Walmart for 500 bucks as a quick replacement for my old Sony Vaio which finally died last year. I've had this laptop for a year. And I have had a few issues with it. I've had 2 fairly destructive trojans and I have had to reinstall Windows once. And take it in for maintenance for a broken A/C power jack. Otherwise, it has been a powerful, speedy and lightweight laptop. Very thin and actually quite stylish. I must say, I use this laptop daily for hours upon hours, and the letters on my keyboard are already wearing off. Despite a few setbacks,I have been very impressed with this machine. Even though I know this laptop won't last me 10 years, for the low price, I am happy it has been so reliable for now. Looking forward to updating to Windows 8 very soon.", "Date": "November 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works like a dream", "Author": "Todd", "ReviewID": "R1EAWGD3YTYD0S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "when i found this computer online, i was really hesitant about buying it, but to my surprize i got exactly what i ordered to the T. i would defly recommend this seller. fast shipping, tracking, and great customer service. when i had a question, they emailed me back with minutes with answers.", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Screen Size: 14\"\nScreen Resolution: 1366 x 768\nProcessor Type: Intel\nProcessor Model: i3-2310M\nProcessor Speed: 2.1GHz", "Name": "Sony VPCEG1BFX/W 14 Inch VAIO  Laptop PC with Intel Core i3-2310M Processor and Windows 7 Home Premium White", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31pcm5jAtiL.jpg", "ProductID": "B007BFBV4G"}}
