I love them all.  I did have a problem with one.  I contacted the company, they issued me an immediate RMA number and I sent it in for service.  They replaced the motherboard at no cost to me in a timely manner.  I bought this one off Amazon because it met my needs and I could get it overnight with Amazon's excellent fast delivery.  This one had Windows 8 which I upgraded to 8.1 with no problem.", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very well built, excellent performance", "Author": "RadioFrequency \"RF\"", "ReviewID": "R20NE19LE7F05Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Couldn't be happier.

My only disappointment so far is that this model from Amazon does not include a webcam.  If you look at the close-up above the display, it looks like it might have one but it doesn't.  Even my cheap little Toshiba had a decent camera built-in.  Other than that, you can feel the heat on your lap when gaming but that would be expected.  I got myself the \"Blue LED 10-Inch to 17-Inch Laptop Notebook Cooling Cooler Stand Pad\" (B0089V3WDO  The laptop came very well packaged.
