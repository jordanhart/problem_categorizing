{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best of the convertable Windows 8 laptop tablets, 2nd gen model with much improved battery life, highly recommended", "Author": "David Pearlman \"sound fanatic\"", "ReviewID": "R29A2LQLQNVF9L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is one of a new breed of convertible laptops created to take advantage of the Windows 8 paradigm, which allows use as both as tablet and a laptop. While this category is expected to grow, right now, there are essentially only a modest number of entrants, and only two that could be reasonably be called innovative: The Dell XPS 12 (this one), and the Lenovo Yoga 13. The Dell and Lenovo sport similar power specs (cpu, memory, hard drive, battery life), but the Dell has a much higher resolution, better, screen. In my opinion, the Dell takes that competition handily.This is actually the second generation of the XPS 12, which replaces the earlier model which was released last year (Dell XPS 12 12.5-Inch Convertible 2-in-1 Touchscreen Ultrabook). The new version is almost identical to the older version in all physical terms, with the primary difference being that it's slightly lighter (about 3 ounces lighter). Under the hood, there is one very significant difference: This new model uses Intel's latest \"Haswell\" line of processes. These processors are APPRECIABLY more energy efficient than the previous generation processors (\"Ivy Bridge\") that were used in the previous iteration of the XPS12. This means that run time on a full battery charge has increased from around 5 hours to around 8 hours. (!!!!) That single change--to run time on a full charge--addresses what many considered to be one of the major downsides of the previous generation XPS 12. (Note: The two processor lines, Haswell and Ivy Bridge, are pretty close to indistinguishable in terms of performance, with the Haswell just ever-so-slightly better [PassMark scores of 3380 and 3278 for the Haswell and Ivy Bridge, respectively, with higher being better]).Now, focusing on the XPS 12 as a total package: This is a terrific piece of hardware, with a lot of pros, and only a few significant cons.Summarizing,Pros:Beautiful super high resolution 1920x1080 12.5\" screenVery high build qualityTerrific innovative screen that rotates in the frame to go from laptop/keyboard to tablet configurationVery responsive with even the base configuration of an Intel I5 processor and 4Gb memoryIncredibly fast boot time (10-15 seconds)Very good keyboardResponsive touchscreen which operates in both laptop and tablet modesFast SSD drive in all configurationsDecent webcam (1.3mp)Light, portable charging cable.Bluetooth, Wireless N (5 + 2.4Ghz)Backlit keys on keyboardBattery life is 8+ hours (New for this version!)Eh:Weight is 3.2 pounds, which isn't heavy, but isn't super light for a 12.5\" laptop. A bit heavy feeling in tablet modeSpeakers are predictably mediocre for a small laptopBase configuration has only a 128Gb mSata SSD hard drive. However, the hard drive IS user replaceable.Cons:No HDMI or VGA port. Only a graphics mini displayport, which means you will need to carry a mini displayport -> HDMI or VGA adapter if you want to use this for business or with a TV/external monitor.Memory is soldiered to motherboard and is not upgradeable. Fortunately, even the base configuration 4Gb of memory is more than sufficient.Only two USB ports (both USB 3.0, however)Battery is not easily user swapped/replacableNo built in media card reader. If you want to the SD card from your camera, you'll need to carry an external reader.No GPSNo wired Ethernet port. If you want wired Ethernet, you'll need to buy a USB-to-Ethernet adapter. (You have wireless Ethernet, of course).Of the cons, the worst, in my opinion, is the fact that the battery is not easily swapped/replaced. While the 8+ hour run time is very respectable, one can expect battery life to diminish over time, and I am not looking forward to dealing with that eventuality. Also, I like to carry a spare battery to swap out for long trips. That's not possible here.Having struggled with various underpowered Android based tablets, including the Asus TF301/keyboard dock, I can say that using the XPS 12 in tablet mode is like a huge weight has been lifted. The XPS 12 screams when surfing the web, which is something I can't say about any Android (or Mac) tablet I've used--and I've used a lot of them.People have complained about the lack of apps in the Windows 8 app store--and it's true that the Windows 8 app store is pretty anemic compared to Andoid or Mac. But some of the most important apps are there (Skype, Netflix, etc.) and it's still growing. There are enough to make using the tablet mode acceptable now...and the responsiveness provided by the Intel I5 processor makes it a pleasure to use.There are a few configuration options available for the XPS 12, all related to the processor (a few speeds of I5 and I7), memory (4Gb or 8Gb) and hard drive size (128Gb or 256Gb or 512Gb). My recommendation: Any of the available processor speeds will be more than acceptable and the difference between the I5 and I7 processors for almost any user will be negligible. Similarly, most users will not need the 8Gb of memory. Windows 8 runs perfectly fine on 4Gb of memory. Unless you plan on running memory hog processes (advanced video editing, certain scientific apps, etc.) you won't need the extra memory. If you do need the extra memory, however, you need to order the laptop with 8Gb installed from the factory, as the memory is not user-upgradeable (it's soldiered to the motherboard...grrr...) A larger hard drive than the 128Gb SSD that comes installed on the base model is definitely a nice feature. But the hard drive IS user replaceable, and the incremental cost of getting the 256Gb mSata SSD from Dell is more than it would be to buy that 256Gb mSata SSD on the aftermarket and clone your 128Gb drive onto it. (You will also wind up with a spare 128Gb drive that way). Unless you are scared of the idea of hard drive cloning/migration, I'd recommend that path. Please note that this laptop uses the mSata configuration hard drive, rather than a full sized SSD to save space. mSata drives tend to be a bit more expensive than standard SSD drives.Overall, this is a terrific laptop, and buying the least expensive configuration version is, for most, the recommended route. In addition, the newer generation processor used for this updated version of the XPS 12 had addressed one of the major limitations of the earlier version, bumping the battery life to over eight hours.", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Needs a lot of work to be a good untrabook", "Author": "Abhishek Ghag", "ReviewID": "R2UEMQZ683OTLW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was waiting for a long time for a good deal on this laptop. Finally amazon offered a steal at $1200 with 256 gb ssd, 8 gb ram and i7 haswell. What attracted me most was the battery life. Then it was the great design of this laptop. For me this was the perfect design for a convertible laptop. Now let me get to the pros and cons of this particular model:Pros:1. Screen is a beauty. Its well lit. Even in power saver mode the screen brightness is perfect for daily use.2. Its fast. I wanted a i5 instead of the i7 processor with the rest of the specs but there was no configuration available with 256 gb ram and i5.3. Touch sensitivity is good. I heard from lot of reviews that windows 8 without touch is not the best experience. Frankly speaking i seldom use the touchscreen. Also the I have not used this laptop in tablet mode so much.4. Amazing battery life. Haswell makes a lot of difference. I was afraid I will be getting a hit on battery life with i7. But I am happy to see that the battery life is great. I am getting close to 7-8 hours. I know battery life will vary from user to user but just as an example I watched 3 hours of netflix and 1.5 hours of surfing and I had 56% remaining. I always hated the battery remaining indicator on windows coz it never shows a correct estimate of remaining time and also windows didn't have any way to check how many hours I used. This changed in windows 8. Not the easiest way to find this but running \"powercfg /batteryreport\" on command line will give you a detailed usage.5. Keyboard keys are well spaced out and backlit is a good addition.6. Build quality is great. It feels premium and sturdy.Cons:1. Trackpad was horrible. Only after searching online I have finally been able to make this thing workable. I wanted to return this laptop. I was even ready to pay for the restocking fee (amazon doesn't offer a return if the laptop ain't broken). I knew about this when buying and many said that after the latest driver update there trackpad worked fine. It didn't for me. My laptop shipped with the latest drivers. Whenever I scrolled down the page it would auto scroll to top. If scrolling up it would auto scroll to bottom. The gestures are too sensitive. Even when using trackpad for normal use the laptop will switch between apps due to the extra sensitive left gesture. Its a feature in windows 8 where left swipe will do what alt + tab does. Scrolling is frequently unresponsive especially in windows store. Finally after making trackpad pressure to zero things became better. Not great but usuable. Windows store scrolling still has issues.2. Windows 8 experience is still not great. I have a android phone (HTC one) and nexus 7 tablet. I feel android OS seems much more mature for a tablet experience comparatively. Some how the android os apps seems more user friendly to me than windows 8 in terms of design.3. Some apps can be annoying. When I installed chrome it worked in windows 8 metro mode. For some reason it decided to switch to desktop mode and now its stuck in desktop mode. There will be a constant switching between desktop apps and windows 8 apps which gets annoying and confusing after some time. The confusing part is when you want to use app switcher all the applications running in desktop mode will be shown as one application called desktop and all windows 8 applications are displayed as individual apps. This is one reason i wanted chrome to switch back to windows mode. I know i can do it by going in options for chrome. The alt + tab does this behavior correctly displaying all individual applications separately.4. I was a very early user on android. The android apps had one common problem in the beginning. Apps would constantly redirect to website for a few advanced options. This is the behavior I see in multiple apps in windows store. For example amazon app redirects to website if you want to change account settings.5. Camera is not that great. Grainy when doing video chat.6. Wifi is unreliable. Since internet is the most important thing in a laptop these days I thought dell would have perfected this. It works 95% of the time. Some times it will simply disconnect which is fine. Other times it shows connected but there won't be internet. I confirmed that my other devices are working when this happens.Minor issues but no big deals:1. Hate the fact that there are no dedicated buttons for home and end.2. Dell bloatware is too much.3. windows store lacks good apps. But since this is not RT windows 8 its not a big deal.Don't get me wrong there are lot of good things about this laptop but some of the issues are really annoying. Some issues mentioned here may not be related to the laptop but are related to windows but this review is about my complete experience.", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop, Incorrect Specifications", "Author": "Wayne Steenburg", "ReviewID": "R2181GNY8O4DXJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great ultrabook/tablet hybrid.  The keyboard is permanently attached, so it is best suited for those that primarily want a laptop with the option to use it like a tablet.  The screen rotates within its frame allowing the keyboard to be hidden in tablet mode.  It ships with Windows 8, but can be easily upgraded to 8.1 for free by visiting the Windows Store.  The battery life is exceptional at 7-8 hrs partially due to the 4th generation \"Haswell\" processor by Intel.This product is wonderful, however the listing is inaccurate.

The machine has surprisingly good build quality, and I'm enjoying it so far.  I have the i7-4500U model with 256GB SSD.Thoughts on Windows 8:Use of Windows 8 is a bit awkward, so I hope you like launching applications by hitting the start button and typing the name of your application to search for it.  I don't quite get the workflow of the metro interface, and I find it rather chaotic.  It's so disorganized to find all your applications in an array of tiles, and I have barely installed anything.  The good news though is that Windows key + D still takes you to desktop and out of metro, so if you could live with windows 7, you'll manage with 8 no problems.  Windows 8 and this laptop apparently both support windows fast boot, which is actually a boot from hibernation.  In less technical terms, this means it boots and shuts down much faster than expected.  Think more like 10-15 seconds.  Snazzy if you need to get on fast and send off some emails.  Searching windows store is awkward, and I have not tried to install windows 8.1.  For those who wish to brave it, you must install windows updates on your unit before windows 8.1 will prominently appear in the store.HARDWARE/BUILD:The unit is rigid and resists twisting, and the frame around the screen is pretty heavy aluminum.  I think this frame/hinge should stand up to the test of time, and I was worried before receiving that this might be a potential source of failure.  The touch screen responds very well, and the display quality (1080p) in a 12.5\" environment is surprisingly readable, and looks gorgeous.  The color reproduction and contrast are stellar.  I did not expected the Dell XPS 12 screen to make my existing desktop monitor look so apallingly terrible when placed side by side.  Dell has a winner on this one.Also exceeding expectations is the keyboard.  This one is about nice as I've seen on a laptop, and I feel is comparable in quality to those on the Apple Macbooks.  It's even backlit, apparently.  Key arrangement seems standard.  Default behavior for function keys is to press F1..F12.  Function key needed for their secondary functions, like screen brightness, enable/disable wifi, and so forth.  Good default choice for working. Hurrah?Trackpad receives less praise from me.  By default the speed of movement/scrolling are terribly slow and need to be changed so the trackpad can be reasonably used.  There is also some quirkiness with some of the windows 8 touch gestures.  Namely, swiping in from the left side triggers a movement from windows desktop to metro (or back if repeated).  I find I accidentally trigger this gesture periodically.  This can also be disabled.  But on the side of things that aren't easily changeable, I find Two Finger scrolling to periodically freak out, and effectively do a page up that brings me to the top of whatever I was scrolling in.  This doesn't always happen, but when it does it is irritating.  I have not tried alternatives to Dell's most recent trackpad drivers.  Scrolling with the touchscreen works beautifully though, as do the easy to reach and ever trusty arrow keys.Coating of the unit has some sort of rubberized feel.  Not too slippery, and it isn't glossy black and prone to attracting fingerprints.  The touch screen attracts less fingerprints than I'd expect as well.I've had no issues with wifi, and find that it performs better (both faster and more reliably) than my ancient netbook, my only current comparison point.  I've had transfers of over 3mb/s on some wireless networks [This should be taken as some actual point of usage, and may not be the maximum].  No issues here.The headphone audio doesn't work out of the box properly.  Another reviewer here noted that there is buzzing during music play, and slightly before it and after it.  This buzzing is irrespective of the system volume (as so long as it's on) and is triggered I guess when the audio is about to activate.  I found this exceedingly annoying, and updating the Dell Drivers did not fix the problem.  However, downloading the most recent drivers from Realtek directly (64bit R2.73) fixes this issue and after this the audio performs as should be expected.  The speakers in this unit perform reasonably (for integrated speakers in a laptop, which of course is still worse than all but the cheapest dedicated external speakers).  They're not particularly tinny, and they push sound out the sides (rather than bottom or top) of the laptop, so they work equally in laptop or tablet mode.TABLET MODE:I suppose my last thoughts on the hardware should be on the touch screen flipping.  This device does work OK as a tablet, and the screen will auto-rotate once the laptop screen has been pushed out of its frame from the normal laptop position.  However, some of the screen rotation behavior is counterintuive until you realize the sensor is embedded in the body of the laptop itself, and not in the screen.  For instance if you have the laptop in the normal open position, and flip the screen 180 from you so it points away (perhaps at a person across from you), the screen will be upside down, as the gyroscope is in the laptop body that has not moved.  If you want the screen upside down you have to tilt the unit, then lock the screen's auto rotation using a button Dell has provided on the left side of the laptop.  From a usability standpoint, I wish the sensor was in the screen (or able to better know what orientation the screen is in), but from an engineering standpoint I can see why it isn't.  I'm not sure how much I will end up using tablet mode, but it seems like it would be good for reading.  At the very least, it is fantastic for playing Microsoft's update to Mah Jong tiles.BATTERY LIFE:Haven't drained it off charger for more than a few hours, but it still displays another 4-5 hrs remaining at lowest.  I'd expect under light use on wifi maybe a bit more than 6hrs, but I admit I haven't tested this fully.  Defer to other reviews of unit.LINUX SUPPORT: UBUNTU - Not ReadyUbuntu out of the box still does not have multitouch drivers in the kernel (As of Feb 8th, 2014).  The drivers do exist - instructions how to install are in the comments of the bug report for this problem located at ([...])Summary:Good computer for the price.  There aren't many options for $1200 right now with 8GB of ram and a 256GB SSD.  Audio requires new drivers to be installed out of the box, which irks me slightly.  The touchpad is only component in my opinion that is not up to par due to infrequent freakouts with two-finger scrolling and hopefully can be fixed with newer drivers.  Everything else is beautiful.Good luck deciding on what new hardware to purchase.  I hope this review helps.EDIT Feb 8th 2014:  Updated linux support section.  I can also report slight ghosting of the monitor where bright colored objects persist when switching to a dark background.  The ghosting for me fades after a few minutes and I don't consider it to be a significant problem, but it could very well be if it worsens with time.  I'll update review if it does.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Could Have Been Great", "Author": "xjf1776", "ReviewID": "R292MSCLNNSYAK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased the latest iteration of the XPS 12 with i5 Haswell CPU during the Christmas holidays.It is a well built laptop with a gorgeous full HD screen.  In terms of weight, the unit is relatively light given the carbon fibre construction.  I really enjoy using the laptop as a tablet.  The hinge on the unit feels sturdy.  It may get a little uncomfortable using it as a tablet for extended periods because of the weight but I wasn't too bothered by it.  The i5 chip is powerful and I did not detect any lags at all.  The backlit keyboard is comfortable to use.  The battery life is good.  I get between 6 to 8 hours of surfing the web, installing a handful of programs, and using MS office.Now onto the one major problem which stopped me from giving this a 5 star rating.  The screen suffers from image retention.  On my unit, right out of the box, if I leave a static image on my screen for around 4 to 5 minutes, a ghost of the image would remain on the screen even after I switch to a different image.  The most prominent image would be the white \"Windows\"icon since I am frequently in desktop mode.  Based on other reviews, it appears that this is a wide spread problem.  Several other owners have stated that the image retention becomes progressively worse.  Dell appear to be aware of this problem and have replaced the screens on affected laptops.  However, many of the replacements appear to suffer from the same image retention problem.Presumably, Dell is planning on switching hardware provider for the screen, and should not be a problem for the units produced in 2014.However, anyone who buys XPS 12 should still carefully inspect the screen.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Screen burn in", "Author": "GMan", "ReviewID": "R1X4ZWSDTYW77O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I did my research before finally deciding to buy the XPS12.

Price was a bit high, but then when I saw a sale during Christmas time (2013) I decided to buy one. I figured, a lot of those screen burn in reviews came from the 3rd gen Intel processor units, and when Dell updated the machine with 4th gen processors they must've fixed the screen burn in issue at the same time.I was wrong.

The problem is quite obvious, sensor indicators show that the accelerometer only recognizes one X/Y axis in Windows 8.1, while both X/Y axis work with the Windows 8 drivers.  So, unless there is a firmware driver update or new release for the accelerometer, this laptop's rotational capabilities will continue to be hindered in Windows 8.1.NOTE BEFORE READING: This review will be updated potentially with a 5-star review if DELL is able to rectify the significant problem this tablet has with the new Windows 8.1 update; I am currently working with Dell support towards a solution. However, at this point in time, I cannot give it more than 3 stars due to the severe nature of the bug.***DELL has created quite an innovative product here, with a screen that can flip - allowing you to convert the laptop to a tablet or work on the backside of the screen. So if you were sitting behind a desk and had a coworker on the other side of the desk, you could theoretically just flip your screen and show the coworker your work with ease. This allows for positions similar to the Lenovo Yoga, except Dell's design has more engineering grace than Lenovo's - when in tablet mode, the Lenovo has its keys on your lap while the Dell simply has the bottom of the machine.  Also, to use the screen backwards, the Lenovo requires an awkward balancing act while the Dell just flips.  So all of this is good, EXCEPT that this machine has a massive bug with Windows 8.1 which has a 7+ page thread on Dell's support forum right now as it affects all users.  Unfortunately, this bug is with the innovative screen; with Windows 8.1 when the screen is flipped, 80% of the time one of two things happens - either it will flip the wrong way (into portrait mode instead of secondary landscape), or it will not flip at all becoming nonresponsive.  This is with all of the latest updates and even a hotfix Dell made available, none of which resolve this issue.  This puts a huge dent into the score as one might imagine, since the screen flipping is one of the primary draws of this device - if you are not going to use it, you might as well get a regular laptop.  I will update this review on this aspect if Dell remedies the problem, which will likely require new drivers or firmware for the accelerometer.That rather unfortunate issue aside, lets talk about some of the other aspects of this laptop.  The weight is good for a laptop, but feels MUCH heavier than the typical 10.6\" tablet - of course this is a 12.5\" laptop with a full Intel Core i5 processor and a real SSD, thus more weight is to be expected.  Overall, for a laptop the weight and size is good enough, as one would likely not be using this device as a portable tablet - it is more designed to be used as a primary PC workhorse.  The build is solid, even the flipping screen looks like it could withstand some abuse.  Screen quality is beautiful.The processor is one of the more power-efficient Intel Haswell processors, though not the most power efficient Y variation.  Still, battery life is great at 8 hours, approaching tablet offerings despite the dramatically horsepower improvement the Dell XPS 12 offers.  It comes with Intel HD4000 graphics, and overall this laptop is FAST!RAM is at 4GB, which is a bit on the skimpy side for the amount this costs.  I would have liked to see 8GB as standard given this tablet's cost and the fact that the RAM is not upgradable; another option could be making the RAM socketed so it is user upgradable, as more demanding applications such as video editing will be bogged down by 4GB.  However, most typical work software like Office and Photoshop will do just fine with 4GB.Storage is a bit rough on this laptop as well, but doable.  The SSD is an mSATA 128GB drive, with no SD slot in the laptop.  So, if you did need to increase your space you would have to open the lid and replace the SSD, which is not an easy effort for a novice. So again, make sure 128GB will be enough for you, if not get the 256GB model.  Or, you could upgrade the drive if you are an expert, but this may void the warranty.  128GB might be fine for a tablet, but this is likely going to be someone's primary machine given the weight and size, thus I think it is a bit on the small size for this market.One other note on lack of SD slot - I am a photographer thus I use SD cards all the time.  But, the SD standard is constantly changing, so it is very possible an SD reader this year will fail to read the fastest cards released 2 years from now.  So, though this lacks SD slot, in my opinion this is not a huge deal since it likely would be rendered outdated in time, requiring an external reader anyway.  The two USB 3.0 ports ensure your card reader has speedy transfer rates, I used a Lexar Pro SD/CF reader with this model.Keyboard is simply fantastic, I love using it.  The trackpad is good, and I had no issues using it at all.So the final question, should you buy it?  If Dell can fix the screen rotation drivers for Windows 8.1 and you are looking for a powerful laptop with flexible screen display options, the answer is a resounding YES!  This laptop just feels great all around.  On the other hand, if you are looking for a tablet to handhold, this device will be too heavy for you - I'd recommend instead the Dell Venue 11 Pro, which is available with a similar CPU and is a lot lighter but with smaller screen.In the end, though, until those screen rotation drivers are fixed it is difficult to recommend this laptop to anyone. It is frustrating when you spend a large sum of money on something and the main selling point fails to work anywhere near as well as advertised, and this is evident in the Dell support forums right now.  If Dell can fix this one problem, I would easily give this 5/5 stars.

O'CONNOR", "ReviewID": "R1OKA1ACLPOXUH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a review for the Dell XPS 12 - Core i7 4500U - 8 gb RAM - 256 gb SSD version:First, I want to talk about the design.  I was initially concerned about the durability of the hinge mechanism that allows the screen to flip.  However, this is an absolutely premium computer in terms of build quality.  The machined aluminum that holds the screen in place and allows it to flip is beautiful, and incredibly strong.  There is zero flex when opening and closing the lid.  The rotating mechanism for the screen is smooth without being too loose.  The screen flips easily while also having a measurable degree of control over its movement.  The carbon fiber body is also very strong.  There is no flex anywhere on this computer.  It not only feels durable, but you can tell that the build quality is beyond what you would expect from other ultrabooks/convertibles.  Dell has quite literally entered Apple build quality territory with this machine.  The screen on the Dell XPS 12 is bright and crystal clear.  It is frustrating for me to work on other computers now because the screen quality is so poor in comparison.  I've been spoiled by the screen quality and brightness on this display.  The only negative comments I can make about the build quality is that it weighs almost 3.5 lbs, and whatever the carbon fiber body is covered in picks up oily fingerprints very easily.Startup on this computer is not as easy as one would expect from a $1200+ device.  This issue is something that anyone purchasing this machine should pay close attention to.  While it is incredibly easy to rectify, it may detract from the initial experience when starting up.  The Dell XPS 12 that is sold by Amazon.com ships with Windows 8 (not 8.1) installed.  Not only is it just Windows 8, but it is the first iteration of Windows 8.  What does this mean?1.  You first have to download the original Windows 8 updates in order to fix some issues with the fans on this computer.  Until downloading the windows 8 update, which includes the updated device drivers, the fans will activate at their maximum capacity whenever the GPU is accessed, making the computer sound incredibly loud.2.  The Windows 8.1 upgrade won't be available to you in the Windows store until you first download the windows 8 updates (see #1).3.  Once you download Windows 8.1 you need to install two updated drivers for an optimal experience on startup:  3a. Dell Touchpad Driver:[...] Dell support website.  3b. Intel(R) Dual Band Wireless 7260 Driver:[...] Dell support website.So, be prepared for roughly an hour of updates/setup time if you purchase this computer.  You will need to first download and install the updates for Windows 8.  Then, you can download and upgrade to Windows 8.1.  Once you have upgraded to Windows 8.1, download and install the newest Dell Touchpad and Intel Wireless Drivers.  This should be taken into consideration for anyone wanting to purchase this computer.  However, if you are experienced at all with the Windows OS, this is really a simple and easy process, and shouldn't detract from your decision to buy this computer.The performance of this computer, with the i7 4500U, 8gb RAM, 256gb SSD, and HD 4400 GPU is nothing short of spectacular.  I use this computer primarily for work related projects, and have Office 2013 as well as MS Visio Pro loaded.  The programs open in seconds, and I haven't experienced any lag when importing large graphics files or spreadsheets into Word or Powerpoint, or any lag/hang-ups using any of the functions or features in Word, Excel or Powerpoint.  I regularly have Google Chrome with several tabs open, along with Powerpoint, Word, Excel and Visio files all open at the same time. I am still able to run Facebook and Netflix in a split screen view, even with all those programs running in the background.  That is quite a feat for a machine this thin and versatile.  I can also play Starcraft II with the settings on medium, and get anywhere from 30-40+ FPS.  Needless to say, this computer can handle almost any work task you can throw at it, and can even be used for some light gaming.The battery life on this computer is also well beyond what I was expecting.  In an 8 hour work day, I don't have to worry about plugging the XPS 12 in at all.  Granted, I don't have the computer in use for all 8 hours, but you can expect it to last through a full work day, even if you forget your charger at home (as long as it starts with a full charge).The last thing I want to talk about in terms of this computer is its flexibility.  As I said in the beginning, I was a bit unsure about the screen flipping, but now I'm convinced this is the best design for any ultrabook/tablet convertible on the market today.  A coworker of mine came up to me at lunch the other day and almost lost it when she saw what this computer can do.  I was checking my email and had a Ted Talk running split screen simultaneously.  However, the computer was backwards on the table with the screen flipped towards me so when looking at it, it looked like a tablet on a stand.  When she walked up to me, she asked me if I could check the schedule and make an adjustment to it when I got back to my office.  Instead, I turned the computer around, flipped the screen, and proceeded to use the computer in laptop mode to make the adjustment right then and there.  She was floored!  Obviously, she had never seen this model before, and after saying that she thought it was a tablet, she walked away telling me that she was going to have to get one.The convenience of having ultrabook power and performance, coupled with the versatility of the screen flip, has proved to be invaluable at work, and at home.  I will probably never be able to go back to a regular ultrabook/laptop after having used this computer.Bottom line:  This computer is worth every penny.  Buy it.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "One of the Best Convertible Ultrabooks on the Market ~ Recommended for Advanced Users Only", "Author": "Terrance S.", "ReviewID": "R2750V6PJGAXJH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Dell XPS12 is a modern mobile computing device that blends the usability of a notebook with the flexibility of a tablet, and it features a flippable screen that enables it to easily and elegantly transition between ultrabook and tablet modes. Overall, I think the XPS12 is a highly-usable device with first-class design and build-quality, though in the factory state, it's somewhat let down by the software. I own the excellent ASUS UX31A ultrabook with touch and the Transformer Book T100 convertible hybrid and I was generally happy with those devices, but after nearly a month with the XPS12, the XPS12 has become my new favorite.The XPS12 is built using high quality and lightweight materials including carbon fiber top and bottom panels, a magnesium alloy  palm rest, and aluminum for the flip-hinge frame. The frame and flippable screen are no small feats of engineering, and in terms of form and function, they are the heart of the XPS12 and what allow it to masquerade as an excellent ultrabook or as an acceptable tablet. It can even moonlight as an all-in-one by going into stand mode! (Screen flipped but still up with the back of the machine towards you...perfect for using just the touch screen or showing what's on your screen to someone sitting across from you.) While using this machine at work or in a caf\u00e9, I noticed that I was getting a lot of attention whenever I flipped the screen, and to be honest it made me feel a bit smug.Although it features both ultrabook and tablet modes, the XPS12 primarily emphasizes being a functional ultrabook over a svelte tablet. When compared to traditional tablets such as the iPad or Surface, the XPS12 feels bulky and somewhat cumbersome, though the XPS12 blows them away in terms of performance and productivity while maintaining competitive battery life. Compared to traditional ultrabooks of similar size, the XPS12 holds its own, though it's a bit on the thicker/heavier side and light on physical connectivity. The XPS12's true talent lies in the fact that while it is not the best ultrabook or best tablet, it is genuinely usable and competent in either role. Of the various convertible ultrabooks and hybrid devices that I've played with, I think the XPS12 design is one of the best: the rigid chassis is solid and good looking, the transition between ultrabook and tablet is quick and precise, and the physical controls including backlit keyboard and touchpad are comfortable and uncompromised.While I'm genuinely happy with the XPS12 now, my first few days with it were honestly quite miserable, and I was ready to give it a 3-star rating and just leave it be. My biggest issue with the XPS12 is that Dell shipped it with Windows 8 instead of Windows 8.1, and while the upgrade from Windows 8 to 8.1 on my ASUS UX31A was completely effortless, the upgrade process with the XPS12 was disastrous. I'm fluent with computers and it took me nearly 6 hours and a couple of factory-resets to figure out how to make things right. After finally getting it all set up, the XPS12 with Windows 8.1 became a joy to use and it's been trouble-free ever since. I describe the upgrade process I used in Note #1 below. Dell really should provide a factory image of Windows 8.1 so users that are willing to do a complete system recovery can have the option to go straight to a clean, working install of Windows 8.1 instead of jumping through numerous hoops.Overall, the Dell XPS12 is a beautiful machine that is mainly let down by the rough upgrade experience, and thus, is better suited for more advanced users. I was thoroughly impressed by the quality of the display and overall build, and I found its performance in general office tasks and even some light photo editing and 3D gaming to be competent. I was also consistently able to get an impressive  ~8 hours out of the XPS12 on a single charge. In the end, I don't have that much to complain about ~ the XPS12 is one of the best convertible ultrabooks on the market.Notes:1) The VAST MAJORITY of glitches caused by the upgrade from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 can be resolved by UNINSTALLING the original Intel/Synaptics DRIVERS/UTILITIES after the upgrade, rebooting, and installing the Windows 8.1 versions from the Dell Support Website. After uninstalling and rebooting, some drivers need to be manually removed from the Device Manager such as the networking/display/bluetooth drivers. After going through this process, I was able to resolve USB ports not working, Touchpad 2-finger scroll/2-finger tap not working issues, missing/unknown devices as reported in device manager, and I was also able to resolve intermittent issues pertaining to display scaling and the wireless card failing to initialize. If you have a better way to do this, let me know!2) I know Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 is a rather large departure from Windows 7, but in my opinion, it's worth becoming familiar with the overall design-language of the Modern (Metro) UI. I've been using Windows 8 for nearly a year now and it's really much faster and more efficient than Windows 7. It's a shame that Microsoft didn't do a better job training users how to take better advantage of Windows 8.3) Wireless connectivity is awesome. The XPS12 supports the latest 802.11AC WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, NFC, and Wireless Display. The wireless adapter is an Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 7260 with Bluetooth in a 2x2 configuration.4) There are only 2x USB 3.0 ports with both on the right, a headphone/mic combo jack, and mini-Displayport for external displays. A side-mounted power switch, screen rotation button, volume rocker, and battery gauge round out the physical buttons. Dell does not include any adapters or dongles for Ethernet or VGA/HDMI so it's up to you to buy them. I bought the PNY Mini-DP to HDMI and Apple Mini-DP to VGA adapters, and both work great.5) I really miss having a full-size SD card reader, and it's a shame the XPS12 doesn't have one. In my mind, the XPS12 would be perfect if it had the card reader and an active digitizer for Pen support. Maybe next time~6) Skype works great with the XPS12. It's got dual-microphones and a 720p HD Webcam that works well in dim lighting. I easily paired it to a pair of bluetooth headphones and everything just worked as it should.7) Compared to my UX31A with i7-3537U, the XPS12 with i5-4200U is slower, but not by very much. (~20% lower peak performance). The i5-4200U's HD4400 graphics are ~25% faster than my UX31A so while it still won't play modern games on high settings, it's at least a healthy improvement. The UX31A's screen is better in terms of color than the XPS12, but the XPS12's screen is more uniform and vibrant. The XPS12's battery lasts ~ 2 hours longer than my UX31A while doing similar office tasks.8) The 128GB SSD has ~65GB Available", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great hardware, software not cohesive enough, good ultrabook that hopefully improves over time", "Author": "Dappa Yute \"Dappa Yute\"", "ReviewID": "R228XH4K9USAFP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This may be a bit lengthy, but I hope this helps in making an informed decision before buying as I always appreciate the ones who do. I got this machine on a very sweet deal given it was an open box and as much as I needed an ultra portable computer, I was really interested in how Windows 8 looked like. In no particular order, I\u2019ll list my experiences in no particular order using the XPS traveling for a week via commuter train and writing my review using the XPS12 machine.Hardware \u2013 I really have to give Dell an A for innovation and hardware design. I\u2019ve been looking at machines since the summer and there are lots of options out there. In the end, I decided that I wanted my keyboard attached to my computer. My only other option was Lenovo\u2019s Yoga pro, but with the price, the Dell XPS 12 was a no brainer. I\u2019ve been using the computer to do this review and it is a joy to type on the backlit keyboard as it is very comfy and spaced apart. I can live with the 128GB mSATA SSD for now. After the OS, you have about 98GB and already blown 40GB with Dell and primary applications I\u2019m using. No slots for extra storage, but I plan on using a wireless external HD. Sometimes, less is really good and with an extra expansion for the USB 3.0 with one powered, I\u2019ll be fine for extra peripherals. The 1080p display is awesome. I\u2019ve always thought this was overrated, but once you have one, you are blown by the crispness of pictures. The Haswell processor makes a huge difference in battery longevity and I\u2019m now traveling for the entire day without the power cord. The build from the carbon fiber is very solid. I find out that it\u2019s prone to smudges, but what are going to do. The metal rim that houses the flip screen also looks well built. I hope it lasts. Some say that the weight is a bit on the heavy side but I\u2019m fine with it if it does not sacrifice quality. At around 3.5 lbs, meh. I also love the NFC built in the computer [one of the very few to have this feature] and already using it to pair stuff to the computer. I\u2019ve seen people complaining about the touch pad, but I can\u2019t say I have. What makes the touch pad so different is that it also controls some of the touch-tablet functions as well and that can be tricky if you are using it as an actual track pad. For example, swiping from the left on the tablet brings the setting-search-devices-start-share menu. If you also swipe from the extreme left on the track pad, it does the same thing. If you wish to use the track pad to move from left to right, you have to do so about \u00bc way in from the track pad. Ditto for the right and it will take some time getting used to.Software \u2013 I was in for shock (mixed emotions) with Windows 8 (with upgrade to 8.1). Dell did an excellent job with the hardware, but again the software integration compliments everything. If you've never used Windows 8, you need to do a test run and get the feel for it because you are in for a surprise. After using Win 8, I have some reservations on the experience. I can\u2019t put my finger on it, but it\u2019s not just cohesive enough. It\u2019s also not intuitive enough. With the apps and legacy software all in one place, I can\u2019t really tell what\u2019s going on (apps or legacy applications) and you have to keep track of what\u2019s going on. Sliding from the left/right, pressing the Windows icon to go back to the tiles and apps, it\u2019s all too much to digest all in one go. The flip screen is a brilliant idea, but rotation is wonky sometimes. However, you can manually rotate it with Intel's graphics software. I can see myself watching movies in a tight space with the screen flipped over. Now, if you\u2019re not a computer savvy person, you may want to rethink about getting this computer. You\u2019ll have find out how to upgrade to Win 8.1, install all the updates and navigate on upgrading the different drivers and chipsets via Dell\u2019s included utility. The apps store is somewhat anemic for Windows and hope it grows soon - like now. Even some of the apps that\u2019s free in Android costs something in Windows apps store. Even though I won\u2019t be primarily using this as a tablet, it\u2019s nice to know that\u2019s it\u2019s there if I need it. The touch screen feature is nice and sometimes you just want to do stuff via the screen. Windows 8 seems to be built for that so that\u2019s a plus. In fact, any Windows 8 computer I purchase will have a touch screen feature because I can see the frustration from using the mouse alone. Microsoft office 2013 seems to work well with the touch screen, and it\u2019s optimized for it in switching between mouse and touch modes.I\u2019m not an expert software wise, but I can see where Microsoft is trying to go with this. I believe there will be several iterations before Microsoft nails down its next generation of Win 8.Other thoughts \u2013\uf0d8 Of course Dell, like all the other computer manufacturers stopped supplying CD/DVD recovery media. Using Dell\u2019s utility tools, you can create the recovery media and bootable image as well. I was having issues with creating the bootable media. What I planned on doing is get a 64 or 128 GB eSATA SSD, clone it, verify that it works and keep it as a spare. I\u2019ve discovered that when your computer crashes and you try to go through various recovery media, it can somehow be challenging.\uf0d8 To backup your entire system image, you have to upgrade to Dell's premium backup software package. That's a shame because it's much easier to revert to a system backup. That's OK and I'll do it the old school way.\uf0d8 Dell has built a great hardware here. you can get busy discovering stuff for months and portable enough to take about just anywhere.", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great for Ubuntu Linux", "Author": "Andrea Majer", "ReviewID": "R4JY5LT6XXOGN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this convertible because I wanted to try Ubuntu Linux on a touch laptop.

It works better as a laptop than a tablet, mainly because it is pretty heavy to hold in one arm after a few minutes. The fold hinge and flip hinge are very sturdy. One small note that cannot be seen in pictures is that you can see a tiny space (about a millimeter) between the screen and the frame while it is fixed in place.The main advantages of this laptop is the solid frame. The carbon fiber feels strong and light and compared to other laptops, there is no flex in the screen at all. You can lift the laptop in one corner and there is also no flex. The flip method works extremely well and feels like it will last a long time. However, I will mention that since it is a touchscreen laptop, pressing on the screen while in laptop mode puts slight stress on the flip hinge. I don't think it will cause any problems unless handled roughly.Some issues I have with it are similar to the ones I read about on other comments. The touchscreen gets stuck sometimes and thinks I'm rapidly clicking on a particular area. The trackpad also behaves the same way sometimes. This doesn't happen very often and can be solved by sleeping and waking the computer. Another issue is the auto-rotate. Sometimes in tablet mode it won't register a rotate. This can also be solved by sleeping and waking the computer. Another issue is using wifi and bluetooth at the same time, which greatly cuts wifi speed to less than a tenth. It seems to be a problem when both are using the 2.4 Ghz band. I would recommend looking at issues with the Intel Wireless-AC 7260 as I was able to resolve it by playing with the settings.A weakness of the laptop is the trackpad. Although I don't have any problems with gestures as others have experienced, clicking on the trackpad sometimes will not register. Another thing to be aware of is that the fan is at the bottom of the laptop. Although there is a ridge to provide smooth ventilation on a flat surface, it easily gets blocked while on a bed or couch.Despite the little issues, this is a well-built laptop that I'm willing to give five stars. The specs of the laptop match the price but it comes in the best frame with a perfect flip design. It remains to be a light-weight ultrabook with the convenience of tablet mode.

I tried the Yoga 2 QHD ultrabooks and HP x2's in stores but was never 100% sold on them.  I didn't actually try this one before purchasing, but it sounded great from all the reviews.A couple notes on running this ultrabook to it's fullest:1. The fan is very noisy with stock BIOS.  Apply the latest BIOS update from Dell's website, as this controls the fan speed.  After updating, the fan is pretty much silent.2. Get rid of McAfee Internet Security.  It bogged down the system terribly, and Windows 8 comes with Windows Defender which has antivirus built-in.3. I recommend a clean install of Windows 8.1.  It will take care of general unresponsiveness of the system without all the Dell software clutter.Regarding the image retention: it's there for sure.  But my tablet and my smartphone do the same thing, so it doesn't bug me personally.  Keep in mind that Dell offers screen replacements for this issue, even when out of warranty.Now, my complaints:1. The USB ports are very snug.  I had a micro receiver plugged into a port and it came apart when I tried removing it.  A wrench helped get the remaining pieces out.  Larger thumb drives provide enough grip to yank them out, but it's still very tight.Overall, I love the system and highly recommend it.", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very unreliable, stay away.", "Author": "Rakesh Taneja", "ReviewID": "R9X06YJNHGILL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Very unreliable laptop.

One solution is the convertible, and this one does very well in either role. I find this convertible to have an excellent screen, to be snappy in use, but to have limited hard drive capability and average battery life.Design:This model comes with the \"carbon fiber\" outside, and it does look very good with the silver accents. Starting from the left side, the laptop has a button to lock the screen rotation (auto-rotate), a headphone/mic port, a power switch, volume controls, and a slot for a security cable. The right side has a nifty battery status light system (each light is approximately 20% of battery), a button to check the battery status, two USB 3 ports, a MiniDisplay port, and a round power port. Opening the laptop, the keyboard area has a good touchpad and and NFC sensor. The top of the screen has two microphones (not stereo, but rather something called \"digital-array), a camera status light, a camera, the ambient light sensor, and a Windows button below the screen.Use:I like the \"flip\" feature; the screen rotates easily from tablet to ultra-portable. The screen is bright and very clear on main power (and good even on moderate settings with battery power), with sharp details. HD video from Amazon Prime sounded good and looked great. The viewing angle is rated at 80 degrees, but in practice I found the screen completely readable well above this level - in fact, it was readable from any angle I tried. Touch input works well and seemed to be very accurate. The keyboard is backlit, which is nice for a dark room. I found it to be good for typing, although it is missing the \"Pause/Break\" and \"Scroll Lock\" buttons, which is a bit unusual. I found the performance to be snappy and quite good; Microsoft Office products showed up almost instantly, and web browsers rendered fast. The fan exhaust port did heat up a bit, but never so much as to be uncomfortable. I personally prefer the I5 processor to the I7 for most use, since it will produce better battery results. Since the included 128 Gb SSD is a bit small for gaming anyway, the I5 is sufficient in my opinion. The computer comes with the Dell backup and recovery software, which I did not test since I do manual backups, and an auto-update program to check for Dell program updates.Battery:I tested the battery using the default screen brightness, which is about 40%. I watched a movie and did setup / install tasks, with the wireless and BT turned on. With these settings the computer lasted about 4 hours. I think that by using additional battery saving techniques it could be pushed to 5 hours or so for most student or home use. This is about on par with other I5 ultra portables I have used. The battery also has a feature to \"extend battery life\", via a program that comes up with the Fn+3 key. On some laptops this restricts maximum charge to 80%, so that the battery doesn't get fully charged, but in this case it appears to simply turn on the Intel power saver features. There is supposed to be a \"desktop mode\" as well, that protects the battery when the laptop is plugged in for two weeks continuously, but the options were grayed out, so I don't know that they work on this model. This is true for the other \"longevity mode\", that will only charge the battery between 88% and 100%. I don't know why these advanced features are disabled.Summary:A bit pricy, but if you need a nice ultra portable that can function as a large tablet, this one will provide great speed and usability. Highly Recommended.----------------More detailed information:Windows Experience Numbers: Processor 6.9, Memory 5.9, Graphic 5.6, Gaming 6.5, Hard Disk: 8.1, Overall 5.6.Good Features:+ Can be converted to a \"tablet\" form - but at the size and weight, it is not that convenient to haul around, in my opinion. However it might be useful for those times when one is sitting around the house and doesn't need the keyboard.+ Because the screen rotates, it is always protected when stored and no screen cover is needed.+ The sound is surprisingly good for such small speakers.+ The power brick is extremely compact and has a light on the plug to show that it is powered up (and remind one to unplug the brick when not in use to save energy).+ There is a nifty power level indicator on side with a button to activate. This is convenient in tablet mode especially, when one cannot check the windows desktop power icon. I found it to be accurate according to the on screen battery levels.+ Two USB 3 ports, one with Powershare for charging accessories. This means that it can charge when the computer is powered off - quite convenient for trips. These ports somewhat mitigate the problem of having such a (relatively) small SSD, since USB 3 external drives are cheap and very fast.+ 4th generation Intel I5 processor. It seemed to do a very good job of running any software I threw at it.+ Internal MSata mini card slot, which means that the SSD can be switched out with a little knowledge and a screwdriver.+ Internal NGFF card slot for a WLAN/BT/WiDi combo card. Again, that means it can be swapped out.+ NFC chip. At present, there aren't a lot of applications for Near Field Communications, but I expect that to change. This is the same technology used on cell phones to allow them to rapidly transfer files or even screen contents.+ BT 4.0 + EDR, so it supports the latest Bluetooth technology.+ Intel Wireless Display supported. This is useful for presentations when paired with a wireless projector.+ Wifi a/b/g/n, so it will work with even the newest standards.+ Dual microphones (next to the video camera). They aren't stereo, but apparently give greater capability because there are two of them. I didn't notice any real difference, but maybe it would help in noisier environments.+ Gorilla Glass, which is more resistant to damage - useful in the tablet mode.+ 1920 X 1080 full HD. Movies from Amazon Prime looked great.+ Backlit keyboard for those situations when the ambient lighting is dim. Interestingly, the keyboard light is not tied to the ambient light sensor - that would be a useful change because it would save the battery in bright light, but provide backlighting in dim light. So far as I am aware no manufacturer has picked up on this idea. The back lighting can be turned off with a function key to save battery.+ The internal components can be user serviced with basic tools - but one really needs to be comfortable with working inside a small electronics case. It is not a simple procedure.+ Includes 1 year of McAfee antivirus.Detracts from the Good:- Only 128 Gb hard drive. The disk is set up so that there is about 98 Gb usable, and I found that there was only about 64Gb of actual space left for programs and data - before installing Office. It can be swapped out for a larger one, but it would have been nice to have at least 256 Gb; programs are big these days.- There is no SD card slot, which is unfortunate because the extra space would be very useful.- The bezel is very large, especially at the top and bottom. This results is a pretty large size. It is probably due to the fact it can convert to a tablet, but the unit seems a bit large overall.- The camera is only 1.3 megapixels. This is sufficient only for video conferencing; but this is an ultraportable (it goes places), so I would have hoped for a better camera to actually use \"on the go\".- At 3.35 lbs, this one is a bit heavy, especially for a tablet.- 4 Gb is the maximum memory, and it is fixed to the motherboard, so it cannot be updated.- There is only 512 Mb dedicated video memory on the Intel HD Graphics 4000. It worked well enough, and should be sufficient for business graphics, but it was the limiting factor on the Windows Experience Index.- The battery is rated for 300 charge/discharge cycles. That doesn't seem very much, but at least they are honest about it!- The online registration did not work - it kept telling me to fill in fields when everything was filled in already. There was no field for \"City\", and apparently the program was looking for it. Fortunately there doesn't seem to be that much custom \"dell programming\" installed, just the backup program (that is basically useless) and a software updater; based on this example I wouldn't trust it.- The unit came with Windows 8, not 8.1 installed.

I am fairly adept with computers, but after 2 hours of fiddling with this, I could not get the wifi communication to work. As it turns out and after exploring the matter online (with another machine), this issue is well known and a frequently occurring problem.2) The trackpad just does not function well at all. At times the pointer will just freeze and it would take hitting the Escape key to restore functionality with it. Again, as it turns out, this is a common malady with the XPS 12 based on information available online.The supposed remedies for these issues are tied to updated drivers (the wifi driver that was installed on the late 2013 machine that I received was five versions old.)Bottom line - there are too many other good machines out there to waste my time fiddling around trying to get one to simply \"work.\" The experience revealed to me that Dell needs to get their processes under better control to ensure that retailers work with the end user and that computers like this do not leave the retailer's door without being fully tested to ensure satisfactory functionality.I ended up purchasing a Macbook Air 13 here on Amazon.
