Its fast and Toshiba builds them sturdy.The only downfall for this laptop is the speakers - they are not something to brag about. They are truly very bad. My 7 year old dell that broke down had much better speakers than this one.If you don't care about that - then this is a very good laptop.", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's ok", "Author": "Chief1nut", "ReviewID": "R1QJPDC7W3XOA2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "this product is great on speed and instant on which I liked about it.  Now the biggest downfall about this is the speakers system on this sounds like crap!  I had a satellite before this and the sound system rocked and thats why I bought another one, now I'm just dissapointed about this, so if you want proformance this is it, if you want is for sound then forget it!", "Date": "October 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Quality PC", "Author": "Robert J.

This one works great, has a nice bright screen, easy to type on keyboard. Only downside I find is that it feels cheap with so much plastic comprising it. Still haven't broken it. Though it has only fallen once onto its side from about 3 1/2 ft. So far, great investment. This is now the only pc in my home and is my personal business pc as well. I have no concerns recommending Toshibas for great basic/midrange laptops.", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lasted 3 days", "Author": "my_dear_aunt", "ReviewID": "R27RPUWOFBV70U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "What a piece of junk.  Lasted 3 days, then started the freeze up, death screens, etc.  Not recoverable, it's basically a brick now.  Cannot return to Beach Audio (stay away from them, too), an excluded item, so I am stuck with this piece of junk.  No more computer purchases from Amazon, or anyone online.  I'd give negative stars if they were available.  Very dis-appointed, I had a specific use for it, with specific reasons to buy due to the OS and system architecture. now I have a $500+ doorstop.  I'll have to buy a new hard drive, replace same in the PC and try a (FREE) Linux deployment on it, but my audio editing software / hardware will not run on Linux,sorry to say. I might be able to have a general use PC in doing so, we'll see. Windows 7 works very well on another laptop I have, so the OS is not the problem.Toshiba Satellite 15.6\" AMD Quad-Core 640GB Laptop", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "15.6\" HD TruBrite LED-backlit display, AMD A8-4500M Accelerated processor (1.9GHz, 4MB L2 Cache), 6GB DDR3 SDRAM system memory (expandable to 16GB)\n640GB SATA hard drive, SuperMulti DVD Burner, 10/100 Ethernet, 802.11b/g/n Wireless LAN\nAMD Radeon shared HD 7640G Dual Graphics Memory, Webcam with built-in microphone, 6-in-1 memory card reader\n2 x USB 3.0 ports, 1 x USB 2.0 port, 1 x headphone jack, 1 x microphone jack, 1 x RJ-45 Ethernet port, 1 x RGB port, 1 x HDMI port, 6-cell lithium-ion battery, up to 6 h 8 min battery life\nGenuine Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium 64-Bit Edition, Energy STAR Qualified, Mercury Silver", "Name": "Toshiba 16-Inch Satellite L855D-S5220 Laptop PC with AMD A8-4500M Accelerated Processor and Windows 7 Home Premium with Windows 8 Pro Upgrade Option", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Ta19A92-L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009FB2DG4"}}
