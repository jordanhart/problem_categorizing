{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Basic 500 MHz iBook", "Author": "R. G. Michel \"rgmichel\"", "ReviewID": "R1S40LH7VR7LZA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the one with a 20 GB hard drive, and I have since put an extra 256 MB memory in it. This machine is wonderful because it is so light, and yet it is powerful enough to run OS X, and just about any software you want to throw at it. It is dynamite on airport networks. I move mine between home and work i.e. between two airport networks, and that is really easy and convenient. The screen is just the right size for a portable, and really easy to read, and clear as crystal. If you want speed, go for the higher CPU speeds and the higher bus speed, but I have been very happy with the 66 MHz bus and 500 MHz processor. It is fine for everyday work. If you really want to move fast, use your desktop. I use a dual processor G4 with two screens when I really need to move fast during the day. However, my ibook is always on, in use for my calendar and for backups, resting by the side of my desktop screens. I would not be without it. At home it is my main machine, where I do all my work stuff. What amazes me is how many applications I can keep open and in use for hours under OS X. No crashes, lots of flexibililty to keep many things going at once. Absolute magic! The really neat thing is when you meet a PC maven, or even a G4 Powerbook, the other machines are so BIG! This ibook is wonderful on the road. I have carried my ibook around in a ordinary bag, not a padded computer bag, for a week at at time, bumping about, with no ill effects, either on the computer or on my shoulder!I add this comment over a year later.  I stand by what I said above, except that the hinge on the screen is giving me trouble now.  The computer needs to warm up for a while before I can put the screen in its fully opened position. Eventually, I am going to have it fixed.", "Date": "November 25, 2001"}, {"Title": "poor", "Author": "mary may", "ReviewID": "RY9V1118JJGZ8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Computer has never worked.

I bought it to replace my then 6yo 9500, which died of burned out motherboard. The iBook was supposed to be a temporary fix, until a G5 desktop came out. Now that I have used this model for almost 9 months I think my next Mac will be an iBook. I do graphics, and the 12\" screen is not hard to deal with. The extra cable, from Apple, lets me hook up to a TV, stereo, or projector. The included monitor adapter lets me hook up to a monitor for a dual screen. I hope the next iBook I get will let me have an additional screen, instead of mirroring. The only things I would want for my next model would be the Superdrive, to burn CDs & DVDs, a longer life battery, and a G5 cpu (ha!). Right now, in OS X, I can get about 3 hours of battery, unless I play a game. Illustrator, GoLive, & LiveMotion all work fine in X. Hopefully I will find out how Photoshop 7 works on Monday! I have used several desktop models, including a G4 at work, and the quaint, quiet iBook has out-charmed them all. One other thing: at home I use a full size keyboard & mouse, and external speakers.

But finally, I'd had enough of the Windows anti-trust and not to mention the problems with the actual Windows OS. So finally, I decided that I'd get a Mac. The perfect choice for me was the Apple iBook. Since I got it, I've discovered that my choice was a good one. The only problem I've had is that AOL seems to crash a bit. Otherwise, the Apple iBook is basically the greatest computer I've ever used. I realize I haven't put a lot of info on the iBook in, but trust me, the iBook is quite simply the greatest choice for a laptop computer.

At least, not at 1,199 bucks.The bottom-of-the-line iBook is exactly what it should be: Extremely portable and extremely friendly. Extremely fast? Not.This is a compromise machine -- the screen is small and the processor is the slowest available on a Mac. At 12.1 inches, the screen is among the smallest you will find on a laptop nowadays, but it is super-sharp. And the fairly pokey processor is still more than adequate for word processing and iTunes and some basic graphics applications, and for surfing the web. Also, 128 MB of RAM is downright puny in today's computing world. You'll definitely want to upgrade to at least 256 MB.Now, for the good part. By making those compromises, the iBook is not only cheap, it is light -- under 5 pounds. Check out a similarly equipped laptop from your weekly Bestbuy ad, and you will see behemoths weighing in at 6, 7, 8 or even 9 pounds! And you will rarely find one this thin, and never one this cool.Battery power on the iBook also far outshines its PC competition, helped in part by that small screen and slow processor.This is basically the perfect machine for someone on the go -- including reporters like me -- or for a K-12 student.If these compromises are simply too much for you, Apple has an alternative for you -- the no-compromises, 5.4 pound, 1-inch thick, super-fast Titanium Powerbook G4.
