They contain a variety of useful features. One of the newest additions to toshiba is the Toshiba R950 laptop series.  This laptop specializes in providing you with the best features. I should know. I use one at work, and many people in my company use one, too.Because I am responsible for the procurement and distribution of computers for my company (One of the largest construction companies in Australia), I am in a position to review this laptop from my own experience.This toshiba notebook computer features an Intel CPU, either a i5 or and i7 (like mine) processor which greatly enhances the response time of the laptop. I prefer the i7 CPU over the i5. The processor also increases the computers abililty to multitask so that you can download programs without having to deal with a slow internet.This R950 laptop also comes with a 500 or 620 GB hard drive that is perfect for those of you who love to have lots of space on the computer.  There is plenty of space so that you can store all of your music, photos, and movies while still having enough space for downloads.There is a CD/DVD drive that plays all of your cds and dvds perfectly.  This drive also burns cds so that you can share your favorite music with your friends and family.This toshiba laptop computer also features a 15.6 inch screen that includes a high resolution and a high definition picture.  With this great screen you can enjoy watching your favorite movies in high definition and the 15.6 inch screen is plenty big enough to satisfy your viewing experience. You can easily adjust the brightness and color settings to your personal preference.  With all of these features the screen always appears smooth and clear.  In addition to the fantastic displayScience Articles, this laptop also features stereo speakers that are built in to the laptop itself.  These speakers have a very high audio quality and the sound is superb.  They are perfect for playing music and can easily be used during parties and large get togethers.The R950 laptop also has great internet connection and its wireless capabilities are excellent.  This laptop is capable of connecting to almost any wireless network in the vicinity and still gives you high performance wherever you are.  It also has a great wireless range so that it can obtain a lot more wireless networks than most laptops can.  With 3 usb ports you can use multiple multi media devices at once.  You can plug in your printer and download music and photos from your ipod and camera at the same time.This laptop runs Windows 7 without a hitch. Druing the year I have had I haven't had any crashes. The operating system purrs along happily.I use Microsoft Office 2010 on my laptop with 8 GB of ram. That's probably and overkill.You can run the latest Autocad of any other Cad on the i7 version with 16 GB memory. Users have reported excellent performance with this software on configured laptops.I remember the days when Toshiba introduced the P5 and P10 laptops years ago. Compared to days laptop from Toshiba, they were woefully underpowered for the average business user. Toshiba has made great strides in manufaturing the R950 laptop.The only problem I jave noticed is the hdd life. If you do not have the hdd protections software installed and you move the laptop while it's on, you're asking for trouble with the hdd. It seems like that's the only week point I can come up with.Oh yeah, and the human factor. If you leave a pen on the keyboard and shut the lid, guess what will happen? Yep, cracked screen.Oh no, you're thinking, that's expensive.The pleasant surprise here is that if you take to an authorised repait centre it will only cost around $240. That's value.I'm happy with my Toshiba R950Jussi HemlundGoole+ [...]", "Date": "August 11, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00B1IG4NM"}}
