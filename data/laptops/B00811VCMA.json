{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Acer S5 - Here At Last - Updated", "Author": "Robert Fewkes", "ReviewID": "R73X78H9NIEWN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "ORIGINAL 7/4/2012 REVIEW:I've been waiting for (stalking) this laptop since it was announced at CES, so when word came out that it was finally going to be available in June, I was thrilled.  Unfortunately, Amazon kept saying it was still a pre-order, even well past the June 24th release date that Amazon published on their site (as of writing this review, Amazon provides for a 3-4 week shipping time).  I was able to order it from another online retailer on July 2nd, and with overnight shipping had it in my hands on the 3rd.At this point I've had the S5 for a little over 24 hours...  but here is what I've seen.The Good:-Super fast load times, fast install times, just overall snappy response.-The metalic case has a nice feel.  Much nicer than the last Acer laptop I used (an Acer One Netbook)-Video is clear and sharp to my eyes.  I saw some of the forums complained about the resolution, but I use my computer for work and browsing, not gaming or watching hi-def videos.-Comes with a blue-tooth mouse.  This is probably in the product description someplace, but I hadn't noticed it.  It appears to be the logitech V470.The Mediocre-The keyboard has a bit of a weird feel to it, though I understand this is a common issue with ultrabooks due to the lack of depth in the case.  Doesn't feel bad, just weird.-A couple times I've come close to dropping it when it started to slip out of my hands, may need to add some grip tape or something.  This may just be me though.-The Magic Flip I/O port is surprisingly noisy.  I was expecting something a little more refined.The Bad-The screen hinge is a little soft, causing the screen to move back and forth when I type.  More of an annoyance.-In addition to the hinges being soft, the screen/clamshell-top is not very stiff, and feel a little flexy.  It would definitely be nice if this were stiffer, just from a carrying around perspective.So far I love this thing, but I'll update the review once I've used it for a few weeks in the real world. As this is a newly released hardware platform for Acer, I'm expecting to run into some bugs that require driver or firmware updates.______UPDATED 8/28/2012I've now been using this laptop as my main computer for almost two months (10+ hrs a day during the week, 5-6 hrs over the weekend), and still think it rates 5 stars.  Here is my updated breakdown:The Good:-Battery Life: Still getting about 5-6 hrs depending on what I'm doing, I think if I turned down the brightness and ran in power saver mode I would have no problem hitting the advertised 6.5 hours.-Thunderbolt:  I was wondering what to do with this port until I tried plugging in a coworker's apple mini display port adapter, and was able to drive a 3rd monitor with no issues, so I picked up a cheap aftermarket adapter off Amazon.  When I'm at my desk, I run two external monitors (1 off the thunderbolt, 1 off the HDMI) and the laptop monitor, and everything works pretty seamlessly.-The keyboard: I'm completely used to the keyboard and have no issues typing on it.-Still super light, super fast (even with all the junk I've loaded), and still very pleased with the machine overall.The Mediocre:-I had a few random shut downs and freezes, hard to tell whether this is the hardware or the OS, although this seems to have cleared up in the last 3 weeks.-The Fan:  It is noisy.  And it runs a lot.The Bad:-It's 2012 and this is supposed to be an ultra portable, only desktops should have port in the back.  Acer, why would you put the ports on the back when people are frequently picking up and moving the laptop? The ports would be much more convenient on the side rather than the back.Things that no longer bother me:-Magic Flip I/O port-The soft screen hingeAccessories I've purchased (and work):-BlueRigger High Speed HDMI to DVI Adapter Cable (replace the HDMI/VGA dongle)-Rocketfish Mini Display Port-to-VGA Adapter", "Date": "July 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice, very nice", "Author": "Ansel Halliburton", "ReviewID": "R1JGDD8KC1BBBT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this laptop yesterday. I was in the market for an Ultrabook with all-SSD storage, which, it turns out, narrows down the options quite a bit. It turns out that most Ultrabooks have regular spinning drives for mass storage, plus a small SSD for quick booting, etc.One unique feature is the \"I/O door\". Basically, during normal use, the USB, etc. ports are hidden. You press a button on the top-right area of the keyboard and a little motor activates and sort of extrudes the ports. The whole back of the laptop lifts a quarter inch or so. I didn't even know about the I/O door before I opened the package, so it wasn't a selling point for me. Seems like a decent idea--the ports should get less gunked up if they're hidden during normal unplugged use and when it's sitting in a bag.Pros:- Very fast.- Very nice screen.- Boots hella fast.- All SSD storage, and enough of it for this to be your primary computer (256GB)- Good power consumption, although I haven't really tested it yet. It lasted several hours last night, and it was downloading gigabytes of updates and email the whole time.- Light (just over 2.5 pounds)- Thin- Comes with an HDMI-to-VGA adapter for older monitorsCons:- Fan is somewhat noisy and runs most of the time. I guess that's what you get with so much awesome inside, but I feel like the cooling could be better designed.- I/O door is noisy. Not a big deal, but it surprised me the first time I opened it. If you have pets, they might freak out.- Could be a little sturdier. I was coming from a MacBook Pro, which was really solid. I don't expect problems with this, but you can tell it's made a little more cheaply.", "Date": "August 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "The most portable and fast ultrabook ever.", "Author": "Repathos", "ReviewID": "R2BDVDP53OZLWS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is possibly one of the fastest laptops I have ever used in my life. With its usage of Solid State Drive and an Intel Core i7 Processor, its turning on time and shutting down time is blazing fast. From sleep mode, it will return to where you left at within 1 second and from a shut down mode to on, it takes less than 10 seconds. It's a ready when you need it laptop. A perfect one for business and school/college work.It's slimness is fascinating considering the automated usb drives and such. The 250GB is a no problem if it is planned to be used for work instead of any media heavy/video game heavy files.The Good/Benefits:-It's ultra fast (1 second boot from sleep and 6 second boot from off)-It's ultra slim-Has Thunderbolt (Although there really is no purpose for this)-Has 2 3.0 USB DrivesThe Oks...-Good enough screen (Not that clear, not that pixelized.-Good enough Keyboard (The keyboard is a bit noisy when typing up in the night, and it could possibly disturb someone sleeping)-A solid 6.25 Hours of Battery lifeThe disadvantages:-Hot! Hot! Hot! (This laptop's temperature increases like crazy compared to others with just browsing)-The screaming noise when you turn open and close the USB port thing.-USB port thing opens and closes when it gets too hot for \"more ventilation\"-Very noisy fanOverall: If you don't mind the noise and put in ear plugs whenever you work, then you are completely find with this ultrabook. Just like how I'm writing this review with this laptop, you want to get more out of this speed!", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Grunge geeky, a few design flaws, but overall nice", "Author": "Randall", "ReviewID": "R2P1I15QSNCAHY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I will probably keep this ultrabook, the geek hacker in me really likes the dark brushed maganesium/aluminum metal look everywhere including the keyboard. And the thin light nature of this, nice for taking in a backpack biking or to a coffee shop. My friend says the keyboard and touchpad look identical to the Mac Airbook, and given that the box said this is made in China, it would not surprise me if the same company makes some of the same components for both ultrabooks. I will likely buy a SquareTrade warranty off Amazon now that I have decided to keep this.I don't use USB or Thunderbolt so the back ports that appear with the use of the magic button are not much use or of interest to me.PROS:Very cool brushed dark metallic magnesium aluminum finish, not 'plastic' like so many laptops.Thin, and lightBoots insanely fast from both power on cold boot or from sleep suspend modeKeyboard is fine, and I am a writer; I was worried about this from some reviews but it is not an issue for me.Screen brightness and colors are fine, especially if you adjust the graphics (right click on desktop); some reviews talked about washed out colors-- yes the screen is dimmer and more subdued if you are on power saving mode.Audio is nice.Touchpad is centered (i like that, so many today are way off to the left which makes no sense and is annoying when writing), large, wonderful, allows some gesture movements, etc.CONS:Battery life is not what one would hope given the competition of the Mac Airbook (12 hrs). Looking at something like 3-4 hrs out of the box here unless you dim the screen and turn off wifi (turning off wifi seems to give an extra 30 minutes, same with dimming screen. So, not listening to music or watching video, just typing, no wifi, dim the screen, you might tweak 4-5 hrs on a full battery charge.It was a a painful experience to get the bluetooth mouse to work, might have had something to do with windows updates; ultimately if had to do updates, reboots, delete existing bluetooth mouse device then reinstall it, still unsure if it will 'stick'.Why Acer put the audio earbud/headphone jack on the right side and far back near the hinge eludes me because that means the cord is all over in the way of where i normally use the fricken mouse. Why did't they put the audio jack port on the left?! Annoying design flaw! If I can figure out this bluetooth issue, i might just buy a bluetooth set of headphones and avoid the cord altogether.", "Date": "September 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "The S5 fits my needs", "Author": "Emmet \"Emmet\"", "ReviewID": "R1ONL327Q0FKR5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far so good.  This machine is a different experience.  Let me set the stage. I am 75, I do a lot of investing, I am big on photos, movies and the making of DVDs on a personal basis. I travel a lot. Add to that I have no cable service where I live in NH. And you can then see how important a mobile computer is to me. Smartphones will not do it for me and I really do not want to work in clouds or rely on some other system for my work. I use a bigger computer for the big jobs. I currently have an HP 311 mini computer. It has been a great aid but it lacks power and is very slow. The S5 is clearly an incredible improvement.  I can now process photos through Photoshop and make movies using Win Movie Maker with no problem while on the move. At a later point I can do DVDs on my larger computer. The 2.5 # weight of the S5 compares to 3.8# while the screen of the S5 is 13.3\" vs. 11.7\".  The HP was a great machine for the price at the time. The S5 is much pricier at $975 but it's features make it worth having. The HP is 3 years old- an eternity in this business.  When I think back of the days that it would cost me about 10 grand to do pictures with a Mac and windows got me in for $2500 with a 100 mb machine-something else.We are always learning in this computer business. I can understand the frustrations some folks have with the USBs in the back and the raising of the ports using a mechanical device. At the same time it seems that you should have as much faith in mechanical as well as electronic systems. It is critical to realize that a lightweight device will sacrifice strength unless you use expensive sophisticated materials. Whether or not it will fail is up to the quality Acer is exacting from production. Since I do not hear well  the noise is meaningless.  The lightness and size of the screen more than justifies the location of the ports. It is only with flash cars where it is a problem and yes if you are wanting to put a usb device in while you are on a bus it could be difficult. For me I use external drives for all of my files. I only keep stuff on my desktop (not supposed to do that) on a temporary basis. I then clean it up and put it on an external drive for use in the larger computer. Mobility is important to me but I am always in my car or a residence.  Where Photoshop would not even install on the 311 it installs and works well on the S5.The typing is far better than on my HP 311. The 311 is the dark ages compared to the S5. But the HP did serve a great need. I use Verizon for my internet connection(we have no cable in my town in NH). So it is important for me to use the machine in the car to check on the markets.  On volatile days it is critical to pay attention. I am a long term investor with a short term view if the market demands it.  Originally the connection was through the computer. Now I am using a Verizon Jetpack.  Since it serves up to 4 computers it was an obvious choice and the cost is similar.Recently we had a power failure in Jersey and NY and my wireless jetpack did a great job. By using the S5 in a judicious way I was able to keep up with the market when it opened on Wednesday. We got power intermittently in my location and I was able to charge the S5 so I do not know how long it would have lasted.  It recovered quickly when I started using it. So I have no real complaints yet.  The only issue I have now is my Garmin Streetpilot 2723 software will not install because of the lack of a disk drive. But I can get around that issue.Update: 11/12/12The machine is performing well. Having conditioned the battery according to instructions I see it lasting about 5-6 hrs., depending on use.?The Bluetooth mouse that came with it was a real buster. It turned out after all of the tech talk and uninstalling and whatever that what I needed to do when I saw the mouse in 'devices and printers' was to remove it and then 'add a device'. Computers can really be silly sometimes but there it is. Otherwise the machine is light,the ports are tricky but manageable and the typing seems better than the HP mini but not as good as a full size computer. Photoshop runs well and the speed of working with the usb ports is great.  Right now it is difficult to tell of the wireless works as well as I would like but Sandy's effect on Verizon makes me wait in judgment-so that will come later. Also the size of the screen is great given the light weight.", "Date": "November 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Terrific computer.", "Author": "J.

Raskin", "ReviewID": "R331H6FTO8LN0W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Over all, I am very pleased with this computer.  It has taken a journey and wasted money to get here, but this Acer Ultrabook is mainly what I have wanted.  Last year when my large windows 7 lap top had a screen problem I acquiesced to the chorus of Apple friends who preach that Macs are superior to PCs.  I figured that if I had to learn windows 8, I may as well move to Apple.  So I invested $2200 and 5 months on a MacBook Pro 13 which as a piece of equipment goes, was terrific.  Then there were software issues (even with Office 11 for Mac) that made operating it seem cumbersome compared to my past windows 7 PC and I sold it at a loss to a colleague.  I started researching other ways to get a light PC lap top.  I did a ton of research rejecting the Dell, Samsung and Asus ultrabooks based on reviews.  I ruled out all win8 touch screens (don't much like fingerprints on my screens, anyway), and figured I'd buy a windows 8 ultrabook and replace the OS with win7 and download office 10 (which I have since learned is probably not possible).  Then while reading reviews at Amazon I happened upon this Acer ultrabook with win7 that mainly had great (if not some skeptical reviews - how can something this light and loaded be this good, etc).  This model had by far the best package for memory and speed of all the utlrabooks.  The Acer is a deal compared to my Mac,and it is making me much happier.  Don't be scared off about \"noise\" and the moving port and venting rear.  It is an ingenious computer and surprisingly light.  I can't believe that some reviewers find the occasional, barely audible white sound to be a problem.  The keyboard is similar to my MacBook, which I find comfortable.The track pad does concern me - it is what prevents me from giving this fast computer 5 stars.  I experimented by unchecking some of the touch pad operations in hopes of getting better control, but that interrupted other touch pad functionality.  I need to read the comments of other reviewers who have suggested fixes for this.  The blue tooth companion mouse works like a dream, but I would like to improve the operation of the touch pad.  It just may take getting used to.I find the computer very pleasing overall and it was almost worth my initial investment to finally get here.  I am grateful for the light-weight electric charger, fewer ounces to carry.Microsoft has pulled windows 7 from Best Buy PC installations and it will become harder to find it on new ultrabooks so if this is a \"must have\" OS - hurry.  I hope my Acer lasts 3 years and if Windows does not do better in the direction of win7 by then, I will probably have another Apple in my future.Update.  After using this ACER for several months, I'm upgrading my star rating to 5 stars.  This is the fastest computer I have ever used, including the MacBook Pro which I sold after months of use.  One other note.  The laptop slipped out of my pocket case and fell to the floor from my sofa.  Such a spill has killed 2 previous laptops -- one slowly and one immediately.  I do not recommend anyone try this, but the laptop hasn't missed a beat, so that answers my concern positively about durability.  I still don't love the un-designated mouse keys -- you have to make sure you press at the very bottom corners of touch pad -- to get response, but overall, this computer has been wonderful.", "Date": "July 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT!!!!!", "Author": "\u03c0.But\\\u20ac\u00ae", "ReviewID": "RP2PZ2NKH587", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am in love with my new laptop!

The buttons are not clickable buttons but are the lower region of the trackpad. My wife uses an external mouse most of the time but when travelling she uses the trackpad and if she is not looking at it she frequently rights clicks when she means to left click. i don't know if the size of the laptop made it necessary to have no real buttons but even a little ridge on the trackpad would have helped. if you only use the trackpad, this may frustrate you.

Cazarescastillo \"wary shopper\"", "ReviewID": "R215K70RQP1UKX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read all the reviews before purchasing this from Amazon, including trade reviews. I admit I was dissuaded by the neg. comments ... for a while;  but after looking & waiting for almost six months for something better & \"improved\",  I found nothing near this price range so I decided to get it ... imperfections and all.Well, the good news is that most of the \"complaints\" and nit-picky comments on here are much over-exaggerated.First, the noisy fan: I can barely hear it, and only when the rear port cover door opens (which is not that often). The person who said he could never use it at a library has got issues far beyond a laptop's fan.  This thing is in the same noise range as dozens of other laptops I have used;  in fact, quieter than most.Runs cool and I feel zero heat on the bottom,  after hours of use. Not at all like my 13-inch Dell Inspiron or my Lenovo or my 13.3-inch MacBook Pro.The screen is nice size, bright and reflections aren't that bad (although I am a fan of non-glare screens).USB 3.0 and WiFi are fast and work perfectly.The keyboard feels great, with enough travel & tactile feel to make fast touch-typing easy.Yes, I wish it was backlit; and yes I wish the arrow keys weren't so small, and I wish it had dedicated \"End\" key ... maybe a slightly bigger Enter key. But it's just a matter of adapting.I love the touch-pad, especially the lower flush left/right \"mouse\" buttons (which cover a big area, actually) and I love the two-finger zooming and other advanced features of the trackpad.The motorized port door in the back is unnecessary, yes;  but it doesn't BOTHER me, like it freaks out some of the reviewers here who already are anticipating it breaking down. There's no \"grinding\" sound when it opens/closes, like someone mentioned.Overall, it's a slick, compact, quality-constructed, light little powerhouse that looks & feels good and works even better.The speakers, for instance, sound pretty decent and loud enough for a notebook of this size: again, better than my 2-yr old Dell Inspiron, which weighs more than twice as much.  Battery life and camera I haven't tested but the reported 4-5 hours of real-world use is just fine with me.  who wants to work on their notebook longer than 4 hours at a stretch?? On trans-oceanic flights I watch movies or sleep;  I don't work longer than 4 hours on my laptop.I'm super-happy with it after a week of intensive use and can't understand some of the complaints here;  I will definitely add to this review if things change with the so-far-perfect functioning of this classy little machine.EDIT - After two months of daily use, average 3-4 hours:still love the notebook,  no problems to report;I keep thinking of the reviewers who complained about fan noise and rear-door opening:  they must have a defect in that area, because mine is SILENT, even when the port door opens during heavy computing tasks (average twice a week).My only \"negative\" comments after about 150 hrs of use would be that \"off-axis\" the screen becomes harder to view;  I wish the keys were back-lit;  and I wish it had dedicated \"Start\" and \"End\" buttons.  that's about it.Oh ... and I should mention that I LOVE the AcerCloud sync and share apps: for photos, docs, remote file access;  very intelligently designed and they execute flawlessly.  Needs an Acer notebook to initiate but then you can sync'n'share as many as 31 other non-Acer devices; I use it for my iPhone, iPad, home Dell desktop and my workplace desktop.  A free added benefit I wasn't expecting.", "Date": "April 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "really good so far", "Author": "Pablo", "ReviewID": "R16XKOEZ5PG81F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product is good as advertised. Everything worked outside of the box with the preloaded operating system. The only bad thing about it is the crappy OS it comes preloaded. I could install xubuntu afterwards with minimum installing effort, thanks to instructions here: [...] (everything but the bluetooth works with current version 12.10, and apparently bluetooth will be fixed on 13.04).Look and feel: Its really nice, the whole black is good to avoid unnecessary flashyness, and its incredibly lightweight (comparable to carrying a book with a few hundred pages). The charger is not really heavy either.Multimedia: was really good, good screen, good webcam, good mic. Speakers were of course not premium, but for me it was even a little better than macbook air's, so I'm guessing is top of the line for a slim computer. Even with heavily reduced brightness (20%) to increase battery time the screen is pretty clear (much better than other laptop's I've used that with 50% reduced brightness are already annoying to look at). I like that the glass of the screen seems to produce little or no reflection compared to other monitors I've tried.Speed: This was great, with windows it booted and finsihed loading everything from complete shutdown in about 10 secodns, reduced to 2 or 3 with linux. Going to slepp and coming back from sleep mode is instantaneous in both OSs. All ports worked.I/O flip: I'm only annoyed by it in a non-rational thought that its going to break. To this day it worked perfectly, it is kind of noisy when it opens/closes, but probably comparable to opening/closing a dvd player's tray, nothing serius.Fans: Then fans can get noisy (more than with mac's ultrabook) but usually it only lasts for a minute or less and then goes back to being quite when heavy processing is over. I do not play games or do any other intense-processing stuff, so I do not know if such thing will make it noisier longer. But even when installing the processor usage went up to 90% several times and only at some specific points the fans were loud. Even less frequently it gets hot, but MUCH less than my previous HP HDX 16 laptop which was a huge computer with plenty of ventilation. Of course it would be nicer if the computer had constant temperature and no noise at all, but this works great for my taste. Take into account it got way better with linux on than the couple of hours I tried it with the preloaded windows system, which of course was to be expected due to windows' ridicuolously heavy usage of the processor just to load the start menu and stuff.Battery was estimated at 6+ hours on windows and is lasting 4.5 hours with linux (which is supposed to have worse performance with power management).Ports: HDMI works perfectly, USB is fast (cannot say about USB 3.0 because I haven't tried any device, but USB 2.0 flashdrives seem fast).Keyboard and touchpad are good, multitouch works perfectly in both OSs. The keyboard is not as confortable as a bigger laptop's or a regular desktop keyboard, but I don't think its possible to do a lot better on a slim ultrabook. After only a week of using it I'm already confortable typing it for several hours at work and I think I would probably get completely used to it in a month or two (I still use my old laptop when I'm working from home to avoid packing/unpacking all the time).Did not try thunderbolt port with either OS.Overall: I'm pretty pleased so far, would recommend the laptop, especially to linux users which sometimes may have a hard time finding drivers and making everything work.", "Date": "March 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worked OK but broke", "Author": "Ira Hart", "ReviewID": "R2KS0CJXDPIC6N", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This worked for about a week and the video on the screen started to lose lines.

I have used this computer for three months. I did have more than occassional system lockups that forced a hard shutdown by holding down the power button. After one of these forced shutdowns last week, the system seemed to go off kilter. The computer failed to startup properly and a RAID controller screen appeared on all subsequent startups. I ran chkdsk and no errors were found, but after about a few days of this behavior, the computer would not start at all because the system said a login file was missing. I called Acer (they answered on a Sunday afternoon so that was good) and they told me I had to default to the factory setup. I lost about a week of file updates, but I hoped this would fix my computer. Even after restoring the factory defaults, the RAID controller screen still appeared on startup and the Acer rep could not resolve the problem on the phone. I had to send the computer to Acer for repair. They only have one repair center in the United States (in Temple, TX) and I had to pay the cost of shipping to Acer. Acer will pay the return shipping. Acer will repair the computer but they will not replace it. The rep told me it will take 7-10 days for repair. I bought a Windows 7 computer because I thought it was more stable than first generation Windows 8. I don't know what caused the system lockups I experienced and the eventual system failure. I hope the computer comes back working better than before.Update 6/3/13: Acer received my computer for repair on 5/23/13 and I received the repaired computer back on 5/31/13, so they kept to their 7-10 days promise. Acer replaced the SSD. I was disappointed that the computer came back with an Acer user account set up and not with a fresh \"like new\" factory default ready for initial setup. I had to spend about an hour doing a factory default restore. I finally got my computer set up and installed Office, Norton 360, Lightroom, Elements and Photomatix. After Windows did over 100 updates, the computer is working speedily and without problem. Fingers crossed it stays that way.Update 7/5/13: The Bluetooth function of my computer has been problematic since I owned it, but it never stopped working completely. A mouse is the only Bluetooth device I use. I started with the Acer mouse that came with the computer and it would frequently stop communicating with the laptop. I would often have to remove and replace the batteries, turn the mouse off and on and as a last resort, removing the device and reinstall it. I eventually replaced the Acer mouse with a Microsoft mouse and it has the same problems as the Acer mouse. Finally today, I had to remove the Microsoft mouse and tried to reinstall it. The system asked me for a pairing code, which it never did before when I installed a mouse. I don't have a pairing code and cannot install the mouse. I tried to reinstall the Acer mouse and the same thing happened. I called Acer customer support and the rep insisted I must have created a pairing code, which I never did. He finally said I should send my computer in for repair. I'm not going to bother doing that again. I'll use a wireless mouse with a dongle, but that will permanently use one of my two USB ports. I'm feeling more and more that I got a lemon. I dropped the rating from 3 to 2 stars.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Got it running Ubuntu but it involved some hassle", "Author": "Riskable \"riskable\"", "ReviewID": "R2SKSF8E4HSTAD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "LINUXThis laptop comes with the dual mSATA SSDs in a fake RAID 1 configuration.  Meaning it isn't really a RAID--it just looks like one from Windows' perspective (in fact, all of Windows was stored on just the first SSD).  This fake BIOS RAID garbage has plagued the PC industry for quite some time but I myself have never encountered a machine that comes pre-configured like that.  This feature caused me some trouble getting Ubuntu loaded...Booting from the Ubuntu 12.04 install disk via a USB DVD drive worked well enough but I could not get it to see the hard drives--even if I set the IDE controller to AHCI in the BIOS (which is the setting you want BTW).  Fortunately, using the \"Alternate\" Ubuntu install CD worked fine.  NOTE:  I had to answer, \"no\" to the question of whether or not it should attempt to detect RAID devices in order for it to detect the drives.I ended up wiping both drives (who needs Windows these days?) and installing Ubuntu across a single / (root) partition that was spread across both drives in an *actual* RAID 1 configuration (Linux built-in software RAID) and it screams--really, it is amazingly fast.  The login screen is ready for me to enter my password about 6-7 seconds after hitting the power button and from there it's only about 5-10 seconds for KDE to finish loading my desktop (depending on how many apps I had open when I last logged/powered off).  It takes about 3-4 seconds to sleep and only 1-2 seconds to wake up.  I also love how fast I can install packages (apt-get install _whatever_ is an order of magnitude faster than my old laptop).A couple of tips for folks planning on installing Linux:  The 3.5 kernel (which is used in Ubuntu 12.10) has a problem with the Intel HD 4000 chip where you'll get a complete mess (graphics) on your screen after booting up.  This is quickly remedied by simply putting the laptop to sleep and waking it back up (close the lid and open it back up--takes about 6 seconds).  This problem is fixed in the 3.7 kernel (I confirmed this myself).  So if you want to install Ubuntu 12.10 just be aware of that issue and if you're feeling adventurous try a newer kernel.Fortunately that display issue will be fixed in Ubuntu 13.04 (which is supposed to include Linux 3.8) and just about every other Linux distribution by then as well.  Until then I recommend just performing that sleep/wake procedure.  As a Linux user you only need to reboot once in a blue moon so it shouldn't be a big deal.  The uptime on my Acer S5 right now is 13 days and I've got it auto-updating every night (for the uninitiated: Ubuntu notifies you when something was upgraded that requires a reboot).DISPLAYI'll be honest:  It's mediocre at best.  Fortunately for me it doesn't matter that much.  I mostly use my laptop for developing software and my default KDE theme is very dark :)BATTERYI haven't tested the battery life much but after a few optimizations powertop is saying I should get about 6.5 hours after a full charge (and it usually isn't very far off in its estimates).  That's good enough for me.PERFORMANCEThis thing is FAST.  Here's what hdparm thinks of the SSDs:# hdparm -Tt /dev/sda/dev/sda: Timing cached reads:  15876 MB in  2.00 seconds = 7944.29 MB/sec Timing buffered disk reads: 922 MB in  3.00 seconds = 307.28 MB/secAlso, each core/thread of the CPU (when plugged in) reports 4789.21 bogomips.I'll see if I can remember to update this review in a few months when the newer version of Ubuntu is out.UPDATE:  I just realized I took for granted a few things...WIFIWorks great.  The Network Manager applet has been reporting me as connected at 130 MBit/sec since I've had the laptop.  Not a single issue.  It uses the ath9k driver which is one of the most reliable/well-supported in Linux.USB 3.0 and HDMIThese work great.  I don't have a USB 3.0 device to play with but I can report that USB 2.0 stuff works fine.  HDMI output also works fine (haven't tested it with audio yet but I'm sure it will be fine since I can see that HDMI audio output is an option in the PulseAudio Volume Control app).FAN NOISE/HEATI don't know what people are talking about...  This is *not* a loud laptop nor does it get very hot.  It is a bit startling when the \"FastFlip\" port opens up when you're doing some CPU-heavy task but other than that it is all nominal.  Even when playing a 3D game (Running Fred--it's a Chrome app now!) I didn't detect any serious hot spots on my lap.
