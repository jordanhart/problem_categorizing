Keeping in mind that I do moderate-heavy gaming and video editing, I needed a strong laptop with plenty of features. And I love this laptop! Keep in mind that the AMD A8 APU uses RAM for the video memory, upgrading to 16GB DDR3-1866 ram highly increased the performance of the laptop overall. Battlefield 3, civilization 5, minecraft, and simcity 2013 all play on high-ultra with no noticeable lag. There is no backlit keyboard on this model, but it is possible to buy a replacement backlit keyboard and install it yourself.Pros:Quad Core CPU8GB RAMTouchscreenFingerprintBeats AudioCons:HDD is only 5400RPMKeyboard is not backlitRight-clicking on touchpad can be a pain", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome gaming laptop", "Author": "Tony Harrison \"Be kind to one another, tender...", "ReviewID": "R3B9FI8QQ67FAK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first HP laptop.I had to drive to another city to pick this up as my local Walmart didn't have it.The only thing I forgot to look for was a DVD drive and this doesn't have one. I found that out 2 days later. I will buy an external DVD drive from TigerDirect.I bought this laptop to take with me on the Missions filed to Natal Brazil.I needed a webcam to do Skype, I needed it to do remote access when I fix my customers PC back in US, I needed it for web design, I will use it for photo & video editing, I always buy quadcores or higher, and I always buy 8GB of RAM or higher, I always buy AMD processors because they are cheaper and just as good if not better than Intel. I've had an Intel i7 in the past and it was junk compared to the AMD Phenom II that I have now in my desktop.The laptop Processor speed ranges from 1.43Ghz to 3.10Ghz when maxing out.The laptop responds very well to speed and the touchscreen. It hasn't freeze up any or gotten slow. Took me about 10 hours to set it up because I had to remove all the bloatware that comes with it, then I upgraded all Windows updates and then installed Win8.1 and a few more updates. Then I updated all the old drivers which was 20 of them and 3 are bad. Then I installed all my software's and files and ran a tuneup cleaner on it and defrag the hard drive.The webcam quality is very low but I can easily fix it with a usb webcam which I probably won't do. The mic is fine.I also installed Steam and I can play all my games like Metro, Skyrim, Elder Scroll Oblivion, Dead Island, and many more. I haven't tested Elder Scroll Online yet but should play fine since I can already play my Steam games.BeatsAudio is amazing way to listen to music through Logitech Gaming headset. I didn't know BeatsAudio was on it until I opened the laptop up.My Laptop fully boots up in 20 seconds and shuts down within 10 seconds because of the tweaks that I did to it. The 4 USB 3.0 is awesome. I can transfer 10GB of data in 5min and on 2.0 it was taking me 25min.This laptop can keep up with my Dell XPS gaming desktop PC that I have.My antiviurs softwares are Comodo & Malwarebytes Pro.I have TuneUp Utilities 2013 to keep it fast.This laptop has performed well at everything that I have thrown at it.I just hope that I do not have any hardware failure while in Brazil.My touchscreen stopped working so I let HP tech support remote access to see how well they performed. The HP tech said that I had a hard drive failure and that I need to send in the laptop for repairs. I was only missing the driver and the tech would not give it to me nor did HP have it on their website. So I reinstalled Windows and my touchscreen is working great now. HP tech could not fix it.The problem is when I updated the these drivers:Standard Enhanced PCI to USB Host ControllerUSB Input DeviceAs it prevents my touchscreen from functioning. So do not update those drivers or the Validity Fingerprint Sensor Driver. Doing the fingerprint update will cause the fingerprint scanner not to work correctly.So the HP laptop is awesome and HP tech support sucks.", "Date": "April 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "All-around excellence and great value.", "Author": "Juny", "ReviewID": "RY7GGWX40CJ4U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this laptop for about a month now and I would recommend this computer to any person looking for a general purpose laptop as it will exceed your expectations for the price. As of 2013 this laptop can be found in Amazon for around $500-$600 and when you consider the specs you get a lot of bang for your buck. FIrst of all you get an AMD Quad-Core A8-5550M with a AMD Radeon HD 8550G graphics card and although it shares the main memory with the CPU it will still run almost all current-gen games in very decent settings. As for the other applications you can expect Windows to run fluent and flawlessly. You also get the extra perks like the touch screen (which you may or may not care for), the fingerprint reader (which I think it's pretty cool) and most importantly the Beats Audio speakers with sub-woofers which I think it's what sets this computer apart from the rest. As for aesthetics the computer looks beautiful in my opinion: it's thin, it's well-put together and the keys are the right size and comfortable (for exception of the up/down arrows which may take some time to accustom to) If your looking for a great laptop and moderate price you should consider this laptop.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Slower than I expected for a quad core and mouse pad a little tricky, packaging it arrived in a little questionable.", "Author": "Environmentally Conscious Bargain Shopper", "ReviewID": "R2BG7963W6LKPC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Okay,  so I literally just got this computer from the delivery dude about 1 hour ago.  I should say I got the refurbished model from a reseller called Secondipity.  The product itself seems to be in pretty good condition and seems pretty close to new at least in appearance.  The packaging it arrived in though was a little unsettling as it was just the laptops box itself with little to no padding on the inside of the box and the laptop floating in the box suspended by just balled up brown manila packing paper, so it could have easily been crushed or broken by the slightest bump in the truck.... but so far so good working wise... but this is just my first few hours with it so we'll see if any problems develop.UPDATE:  After a few hours with the computer, I realized the home key on the numeric keypad, which I hadn't noticed at first since I almost never use it is not flush with the keyboard and is coming off.  The key is loose and just by tapping it begins to come off some more.  I am going to have to contact the seller to have this fixed.  It should not have shipped like this.As for the computer itself, the design is beautiful, possibly nicer than a much more expensive Macbook.  Sound quality is much better than a macbook since it has Beats.  It has no DVD/CD drive, which I thought I could live without, but for installing my printer driver this is proving to be a pain, since it costs to download the driver off the web and I don't have an external CD/DVD drive.Screen quality is extremely nice and easy to read and bright.  Mostly in love with the product, but processor is much slower than I anticipated for a quad core.  I am used to the i7 in my other laptop which isn't even the fastest i7....this puppy's AMD A8 is nowhere near as fast as the i7 which I barely seem to bring over 2-5% in normal use, this thing is running at 45% just surfing the web, installing updates and listening to spotify.  I bought this for doing my photoshop work and for creative writing so I don't monopolize the family laptop, but...I see I'm going to have to be used to somewhat slower speeds or doing fewer simultaneous tasks even though this is a quad core.Moral of the story, not all quad cores are created equal...running this guy feels about the same speed maybe a little slower than the two year old Core i5 laptop I have from work, but it depends on the task, just moving around the operating system feels snappier, but the rest is about the speed of my work i5.Disk access is much slower than the other laptops I'm used to, and this surprises me because they also have 5400 rpm drives...my i7 has a caching mechanism though so that probably speeds that guy up considerably.  I will probably come to replacing the hard drive with an SSD at some point.", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00FDTHAVA"}}
