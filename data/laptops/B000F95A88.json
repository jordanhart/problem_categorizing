The T60 is a much more superior computer in build quality, function, style and progression. I was worried at first but Lenovo has carried the Thinkpad torch superbly into the production of the T60 model.PROS:-Build quality is second to none.-Integrates MS Office Applications easily into hardware.-Super long battery life and high performance options.-Great tactile keyboard and you can buy a keyboard in various languages and type fonts.-All the parts are easily user removable, user replaceable, and user serviceable!-Great customer support at Lenovo!-Unique features like waterproof keyboard, airbag, roll cage, fingerprint security, Thinkpad manager, etc...-SXGA and UXGA resolution screens!-Quiet dust proof fan.CONS:- No SD or Memory Card slots but you can easily buy a PC adapter card.- Runs hot on surfaces like beds and cushions and fan is not super quiet when laptop is hot.- Video Memory options are scant on the T60 models. With 256MB being rare and 128MB being standard. This is not a gaming laptop.- Screen brightness is not as crisp and luminous as newer models. Not a con for me because it is easy on my eyes when typing long papers.- No video/web cam on this model.- Only 3 USB ports", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Machine", "Author": "Misfit", "ReviewID": "R2Z65ROBWZOX6H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "IBM ThinkPads are all top quality.

Originally recommended to me by one of my fellow IT friends, I decided to check Amazon for the IBM ThinkPad T60. The price was right, I needed a laptop for email, office applications, and general sysadmin usage. The best part - these laptops are built like a TANK. Good luck breaking these on accident!Data Sales, Co. provided a great description of the laptop. All of the cosmetic wear was correctly described, leaving no surprises. The laptop was cleaned perfectly, packed perfectly, and even came with a copy of Windows XP (Although I just installed Arch Linux.) I ordered a separate battery for the laptop so I had that extra 4 hours of battery life. 8 hours of battery life for ~$150 is the deal of the century.My only issue is when you turn on, wake up, sleep, or take power in or out, the motherboard speaker makes a LOUD beep. This can be avoided by muting the motherboard speaker by pressing a button on the keyboard.The palm rests feel great, the screen looks great (although don't plan on taking this outside in broad daylight - unless you're in shade.) The hinge connecting the screen to the body of the laptop is very strong. You can hold the laptop by the screen and nothing will swing.This laptop can also be used for light gaming! I was shocked! I installed Counter-Strike 1.6 and Counter-Strike: Source on this laptop to find that both ran at upwards of 60fps and 20fps respectively when I tweaked with settings.All in all, this is a great buy. Do not hesitate, as Lenovo is starting to phase out the glory of the ThinkPad series by using cheaper parts (chiclet keyboards? REALLY?)", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "i love it", "Author": "Earlene M.

Sad part was that the system could not identify its own hard drive. This may have been due to upgrading to Win 7.  The laptop itself is very good but the OS installed was bad (Windows 7).  T60 was not designed for Window 7 but for Win XP. Therefore, I went to SafeNet Computer Repair (9 West 29th Street in Manhattan - excellent repair shop and does not overcharge) and requested them to reload Windows XP Enterprise, increase the RAM from 512 to 4G, Increased Hard Drive from 60GB to 300GB and it's perfect.  Invested an additional $250 to make it work and it's ok now.  If you want to purchase this item, make sure that you contact the seller first and ensure that the Windows XP is installed, not the Windows 7.  It came with fully license Windows 7 Enterprise disc so now I have an extra one.

Easy to replace an optical drive. Easy to replace a hard drive. Such a contrast with my old Apple G4 iBook, which I dearly love, which has a disk permanently stuck in a broken optical drive. The cost of replacing the optical drive on that machine would be more than the laptop is worth. The T60 keyboard is every bit as good as the g4 iBook keyboard. The light above the screen on the T60 to illuminate the keyboard is a very nice touch. The 4:3 aspect ratio screen is the best screen I've seen since my old Compaq Presario 1215US from 2001. One catch to warn about is the volume control on Windows 7 Pro. The Windows volume control gives you only the percentage of whatever volume is set by the volume buttons. I suggest setting the Windows volume control at 100% and then using only the thinkpad volume control buttons to set your volume. I was almost fooled by this glitch into thinking my T60 had defective speakers. It was a Microsoft problem!

The seller emailed me to wait and it would sort itself out,When the thing finally arrived, it was filthy inside and outside.  A large sticky smear graced the lid.

The screen was almost opaque from the stuff on it.The T60 is known for being easily user serviceable.  It should have been trivial to reassemble this laptop into its original condition. When it arrived, the palmrest was loose all along its edges;  it had not even been refastened down correctly.Many of the keys had no face on them. This version of the T60 does not have easily replaceable keys and it shouldn't have needed to be done, anyway.  Anyone who is not a touch typist, even though most programmers are, could not easily use the keyboard.The laptop's memory was an unadvertised 512 megabytes.  This is gastropodial by today's standards. Added to this, the laptop would not even boot when the second gigabyte from my failed T60 was added - it would only take  one gigabyte card and one 515 megabyte card.The battery would not hold a minute's worth of charge.  When combined with the fact that the advertised power shortage was no power cord, this would have left a purchaser without a previous similar model without any source of power at all.The video card was so regressed Debian fainted and could not install Gnome.This seller has decided to sell laptops stripped of everything that can be resold and leave it up to the purchaser to find that out. I would not buy from them again.  I did not return this one because in the process of investigating its shortcomings I did change its original state, for example filthy to clean, fastening down the palmrest, etc. and do not want the additional annoyance of dealing with return postage and arguments  over original vs. returned condition.The one thing it did have as advertised, other than a functioning motherboard, working wireless and an irrelevant Windows installation, was the 120 gigabyte harddrive.", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "It is old and slow.
