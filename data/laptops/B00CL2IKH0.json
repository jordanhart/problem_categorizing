It is fast....everything works...installed a trail of Microsoft Office...that all worked.....love the fact that I have been able to import photos from facebook into a photo file....for a little over 400 dollars I am very very happy.  The only drawback is that ebay was already installed as an app...and it seemed to pop up constantly.....I like e-bay but was not interested in dealing with it as I was setting up the computer.I had a MAC before...never quite got used to the lack of compatibility......this is going to be very nice and I am likely going to order one for my office computer too..since it needs to be replacedthe space  bar is noisy..not sure why that is irritating but it is...if you need a functional, uptodate lap top for a modest price this seems to do the trick", "Date": "September 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Easy to use!", "Author": "Paola Jean-Charles", "ReviewID": "R3AXE6P3LQ6059", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Anybody can learn how to use this product.

As far as the specs, I can't speak to those on technical terms but what I can say is this, it is amply \"fast\" for me, I like the colors which suffice just fine, and  it is quiet .The mouse pad and buttons are responsive and not overly sensitive, I like the way the key board feels, I have to press a bit harder on the keys but as a personal preference that suits me. I am satisfied with my purchase and feel that I received a good computer for the money. I have had two Toshiba Satellites before this (which I liked just fine) which cost about the same as this Dell.
