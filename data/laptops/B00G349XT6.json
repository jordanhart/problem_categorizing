{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best laptop I've ever owned", "Author": "Minuss", "ReviewID": "R10Y4187WD7XNJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a bit of a computer junkie, which means I'm constantly buying a \"new shiny toy\" and this is especially true with computers.  Luckily enough I've always found my laptops super-on-sale so after using them a few months I'm able to sell them for profit to purchase a new one.  Eventually this meant going from $500 laptops all the way to this bad boy.  I've compiled some information regarding this laptop which may assist someone else:Why did I buy this laptop?-Incredibly thin and lightweight-Battery life lasts a VERY long time-8GB RAM is perfect - Any more seems to be a waste for my needs-256GB SSD is a great medium between cost and size.  Of course a 512GB would be nice, but I have an external for media files anyway.-HDMI Out - Essential component that many \"budget\" computers lack (This is definitely not a budget computer)-Three USB3.0 Ports - I never use more than 2 at a time anyway, but I understand that some people will need more ports.  Personally I prefer to use Bluetooth so there are no wires.-Serves as a good desktop replacementBelow are some questions people often ask me about it:1)How hot does it get?-It feels pretty hot when I play certain games like Crysis 3 on max settings; however, I checked the CPU core temperature only to realize it was actually cooler than my previous laptop had been.  I believe this may be due to the bezel being made out of metal which can more easily transfer heat than plastic.2)Can it play games?-This is always my favorite question because it's a gaming laptop and people love to ask if it can play games.  In short the answer is yes.  So far I have run into no problems playing games except with radial flora shadows on Battlefield 3 and motion blur in Crysis 3.  Both of these settings need to not be on extreme or the FPS take a hit.3)How is the battery life?-Great! Best out of any laptop I've ever had.  I'm sure this is directly correlated with the new Intel Haswell processor that is inside since Intel's big selling point with this generation was lower power consumption.  While playing games I generally can get about 5-6hours on battery and doing low power tasks such as browsing the internet and typing a paper I get about double the battery life.  It's hard to get an exact number, but with my screen brightness all the way down and battery saving options enabled I was able to get a good 14 hours off one charge.  Sure screen is a little harder to use with the brightness so low, but eventually your eyes adjust and it's fine.4)Are there any weird \"quirks?\"-When I first purchased it I noticed the internet was a bit spotting.  I avoided using the built in NIC card by using a USB Wireless Adapter that I used on my desktop, but what's the point of having a good laptop if the internet doesn't work well on the go?  So I did some research and realized my Killer drivers were out of date.  (Of course--it's always a drivers issue!)  After fixing that I haven't really had any problems at all with the internet.5)How long does the laptop take to turn on?-People ask me this all the time because my last laptop had a dual-raid SSD so it could boot in about 7 seconds.  This laptop (thankfully) can boot in about the same time.  I haven't really timed it, but if I push the on button then grab my laptop mouse--the computer is on and at my desktop before I've put the mouse case back in my bag.  Any faster would really be a waste considering the work it would take could go into improving something else.6)What did the Windows Experience Index place the laptop at?-The base score is a 6.9 and here's the breakdown:o Processor: 7.8o Memory: 7.8o Graphics: 6.9o Gaming Graphics: 6.9o Primary Hard disk: 8.17)Did it come with any bloatware?-It depends what you consider bloat.  There were no programs such as Norton's Anti-Virus installed; however, there was some of the Razer software such as Razer Comms and Razer Synapse 2.0 installed.  I use these programs so it wasn't a big deal for me, but I could see where someone else might not want them.8)How is the screen quality?-When I was looking to purchase the laptop I definitely considered it a downside; however, since the screen is smaller it doesn't really make much of a difference at all. Coming from a 1080p screen on my last laptop I don't really notice the difference at all. Of course there will always be people who claim they can see the difference, but speaking per inch a 17.3 inch screen with 1080p resolution is 127.34PPI, a 15.6 inch screen with 1080p resolution is 141.21PPI, a 15.4 inch screen with 1080p resolution is 143.05PPI, and a 14 inch screen with 1600x900 resolution is 131.13PPI. With that being said--I'm satisfied with the screen. Sometimes I feel like people are chasing pixels they can't see. . .I think that sums up my review.

Needs a little refinement.", "Author": "Sherif", "ReviewID": "R3G07XKZA0S8NZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The 2013 Razer Blade 14 is a fantastic laptop. It's lightweight, well put together, and packs a TON of power in a small package. They've chosen to provide a premium experience at a premium price. This is truly the laptop I've been waiting for. For the past 10 years I've exclusively purchased Apple MacBooks (or PowerBooks for you old school people) and run Boot Camp to sneak some gaming in. So this is from the perspective of someone who loves a well built aluminum machine.The battery life easily matches what only ultra low voltage laptops can deliver, except the Razer has an NVIDIA GTX 765m GPU that lets you enable high or max settings in all the current games. I have had run-time vary between 4-7 hours browsing/doing work, or about 2.5-3 hours when gaming. This thing is a beast. I bet you're thinking, \"Dang, you really like this thing.\" And you'd be right, but with some reservations.Most of the reviews overlook an issue or two. The screen, webcam, and occasionally defective power adapter. Fortunately, their customer service sent me new power adapters until I received one that didn't make loud clicking noises. I'll break everything down below:Display - This is a tough one. If you see people complaining that this doesn't have a 1080p screen, they are wrong to criticize it. 1600x900 is an excellent choice at 14\" and is the appropriate resolution for the GTX 765m graphics card to power. Viewing angles on the other hand are pretty atrocious. It is difficult to find the \"right\" angle and the screen washes out if you move your head at all.That said, I understand why Razer chose a TN panel; we can't have slow response times when gaming, but the color gamut and contrast is about a 3 on a scale 1 to 10. It makes dark scenes in games difficult to see and webpages with grey text hard to read. There is one positive aspect of the screen though - The extreme brightness and matte finish allow you to use this computer in well lit environments, even outside.Webcam - The webcam is a pain point for me. When you have any type of florescent bulbs, or poor lighting at all the camera responds in an extremely terrible way. It attempts to adjust for the light and starts FLASHING green. It is absolutely useless, but I suppose you don't buy this laptop for Skype/Google Hangouts. I want to be clear, my laptop is not defective. All Razer Blade 14s exhibit this bad behavior and I even received a response from the company stating this. Unfortunately for Razer, I have quite a few devices, and NONE of them flicker/flash like this. Check out this short video for an example - [...]Performance - This is where the Blade 14 truly shines. The new Haswell i7, NVIDIA GTX 765m? So. Damn. Fast. It runs all my games at high or ultra settings. It is simply mind blowing to be using a laptop this small and thin with this kind of ridiculous performance. I don't even need to dedicate a large section to this, you won't find a faster laptop at this size and quality.Build Quality - Speaking of quality. If you've owned a MacBook Pro, or handled a new Retina model then you know how this computer feels. Solid, dense, well built, no flex. Just add fingerprints and that is how this computer feels/looks.Aesthetics - This computer stands out and it is striking to be using a Windows 8 machine with this form factor. Combined with the sweet Razer green lighting, you have something truly unique and people will stop to comment on it.Heat - There is no getting around this, the Razer gets hot... in all the right places. The palm rest and bottom cover of the computer get a bit warm, but they are totally in line with what I expect (and very similar to the MacBook Pro 15\" Retina). Now if you place your finger near the power button you're going to get burnt. It is well over 100 degrees there, but what do you expect when they shove over 100 watts of pure performance in such a small package? Just get a Squaretrade warranty ;)Noise - At idle, and just browsing this thing is dead silent. During gaming the fans obviously kick in, but it isn't that loud at all. It is much much quieter than my friend's GS70 Stealth.Trackpad - Probably the first Windows trackpad that I've truly enjoyed using. If you consider the MacBook trackpad a 10 (and they are), then this is a solid 8. With just two finger scrolling and edge gestures enabled it isn't necessary to plug an external mouse in for day to day usage. I also find the real buttons a pleasure to use, though a bit small to press. It doesn't earn a 10 because it can misread on occasion when scrolling/tapping.So overall, I have to give this computer 4 out of 5 stars. The Razer Blade is their first shot at a 14 inch notebook and they have almost nailed it. It is a beautiful, thin, high performing machine that I will definitely be keeping. It has a few flaws like the screen and webcam, but if you're willing to make a few trade-offs you gain an incredible amount of graphics horsepower to game on the go. And that's what this computer is built for.

I won, so here is my review. . .Lets start with appearance. The design is very simple, no weird angles or bevels, just a clean smooth design with rounded corners. The finish is a beautiful matte black, so it looks great and doesn't take finger prints. While some have complained about the green Razer logo, I think it looks striking, especially since it glows when the screen is on.Next up is the physical build quality - which is superb. It feels sturdy, and will not bend/flex (well, the screen will, but anything that thin would). The keys feel solid, and there are two long rubberized feet on the bottom (running most of the length of the front and back). The charging brick and cord are solid (and wonderfully small and light), and the connection feels very good. Many charging ports feel as if they would break under a tiny stress, this one feels like I could dangle the computer from it without damage (note: I'm not going to try it, you probably shouldn't either). Of course that can be a disadvantage if you are apt to trip on the cord, as that could pull the laptop onto the floor. A magnetic solution (similar to a Macbook) may have been an over all more robust solution, but for a standard charging cable, it feels great.Now, onto the system. Boot time is unbelievable, you can go from cold to fully operational in seconds, which is partially thanks to Razers hardware optimizations, and partially thanks to Windows 8's vastly improved boot times. The OS is pretty much stock Windows 8, the Razer website says that it has no bloatware, which is *true* to some extent. But there are a few programs installed that aren't stock Windows.- Razer Synapse 2.0: I'll give this a pass, since this is a Razer gaming machine, and synapse allows for customizing keyboard hotkeys, and for adjusting the key backlight. However I was disappointed that I could not use the FN key (which controls secondary functions on the F1-12 row) to give keys (even F-row) secondary functions. In fact you don't seem to be able to be able to program hot keys that use modifiers at all. All in all I think AHK will remain my key-mapping solution. It dose make disabling the caps lock key easy though.- Qualcomm Atheros Killer Network Manager: I'm not sure what it's for honestly, it appears to track network (and system) performance, but not in a really useful way. I don't know what the point is, and it keeps bugging me to run speed tests and can't seem to remember that I selected \"don't show this message again\". It just doesn't seem useful, especially with a memory footprint of up to 100MB (that I have noticed). I don't know how to classify this as anything but bloatware.- Intel/Nvidia stuff: There are settings managers for the Intel graphics and for the SSD, and for Nvidia graphics. All are poorly designed, but are probably necessary for optimal performance.- Razer Comms: Unlike Synapse this has nothing to do with my hardware, it's just a chat/messenger application. . . For a system I don't use, or have any reason to use. Skype works perfectly fine. . . So what's the point? Gotta call it bloat.Aside from that it's just Windows 8.Now as too the performance. The Nvidia graphics card kicks in automatically when the intel graphics can't handle the load, so you may see low FPS for a second, that a major spike when it switches over. You will know that the Nvida is on because of a very low hum from the fans that will kick in (though the noise increases as it heats up) as soon as it swaps. I can easily record Minecraft at 1080p and 60 FPS (higher actually, if I don't lock the FPS) with all the settings maxed out. And the SSD is able to write fast enough to not kill the performance. The downside is that at 256GB a 60 FPS raw HD video will fill up the drive rather fast. Unfortunately it gets HOT, really hot. It can become uncomfortable to play games since your hands are resting on the machine, and the keyboard is almost too hot to touch at times. This is unfortunate, but not really avoidable in a laptop that's this small.The keyboard and trackpad are not the worst, nor are they the best. The keys are a bit on the harder side to press, but they feel clicky rather than mushy. Unfortunately due to the size they are small low-profile keys (which can be annoying to type with) and it lacks a numerical keypad (which is normal for a 14\" laptop, it would be hard to fit, but it's missed). Aside from the physical aspect, I have noticed that the back light can be a bit uneven. My Windows key is very bright, and the F11 and F12 keys are rather dim, the back light is a much appreciated feature, but it could have been implemented better. And my last beef with the keyboard? The font choice, it just looks kinda wonky, but I guess that's just personal preference. The trackpad is a synaptics touch pad, with very nice satisfying clicky buttons. it's a fairly large touch pad, with all the multitouch and gestures you would expect, and all the features that normally come with a synaptics device. I think I prefer the (also synaptics) touch pad on my old computer, that was smaller, and had a textured surface. The pad isn't bad, but unfortunately not the best - and simply not very game friendly. But what track pad is?Now about the screen. . . This has to be the most annoying feature - the screen is not full HD, and the anti-glare finish makes anything white look grainy. I would really have liked a 1920x1080 screen, especially for recording games, which requires that you have a 1080 screen to record in 1080.Then there are a few things it completely lacks. First, the optical drive, it has none. I like my BD drive, so the loss is annoying, but well worth the trade off for size and weight. Second is a wired network adapter. An Ethernet port probably wouldn't even fit, but man did I wish I had one when my wireless router was on the fritz.But my favorite parts? First is the battery: It lasts for hours (when not gaming) even with the brightness turned all the way up. Now if you do start gaming (or utilize the Nvida card) the battery is just not going to last, and you can't expect it too - that card is optimized for performance, which requires far more power. The other amazing feature? The weight. It's so amazingly light and thin, and yet packs all the power you would expect from a gaming machine. And it isn't just the most powerful laptop in the size class, but a pretty high level gaming machine in it's own right.Summary:Pro:- Wight- Thickness- Battery- Performance- Design- Boot time- Charger- Supports 5Ghz Wi-Fi networks- USB 3- SSDCon:- Screen resolution- Heat- key size- Back light uneven- No optical drive- No EthernetAll in all this is an amazing machine, it has its flaws, but I think we need a new tech spec: Performance per ounce, cause this machine would be at the top of the charts.", "Date": "October 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Windows Laptop on the Market", "Author": "Alex Rain", "ReviewID": "R1ASTYUVIL4U5X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me begin by saying that I've owned Alienware laptops including the M14x, M15x, M17x and M18x among other laptops not so highly rated, and while thr M18x and the M14x hold a special place in my heart, the Razer Blade has completely redefined the Gaming Laptop or even the Laptop concept with this new laptop.For starters, the laptop is truly an engineering marvel to say the least, it's barely over half an inch thick and weighs 4 pounds, that alone is a worthy to mention, however what makes the Razer Blade something special is how much power it packs under the hood, it's simply an unbelievable achievement.By know, you know this thing has a Haswell Processor i7 4702HQ, and a full fledged Nvidia 765GTX 2 GB, we're talking the latest mobile technologies for both CPU and GPU! And sure enough, there are more powerful configurations out there, but none come anywhere near the size and weight of the Razer Blade. To have all this power means that one can not only do their every day work on it, but for the first time, be able to carry a Laptop under the arm that can play ANY game out there today at High/Ultra settings, that's gaming with no compromises on the go.... For the first time EVER, I find myself actually taking my laptop with me to even short trips.I would even take it a step further and say that so far, I have not even used my 4770k/780GTX desktop that much, the Blade has pretty much become my every day computer.Some of the negatives you'll hear are to be taking lightly... for instance the resolution is 1600x900, many claim they wish it had a 1080p display, however it's the actual resolution that enables the Blade to play all these games with maxed settings, when you put these specs on a 1080p display, you automatically lose between 20-30% performance in gaming.I will say that the 14\" TN LED display could be better, no doubt, I'm not in love with the viewing angles or the color depth, but because of what the Blade does and for how long the battery lasts (6+ hours browsing/office and 2-3 hours gaming)it's not too hard to forgive the screen quality, in all fairness as bad as it is, it works just fine.The build quality is also the best I've seen in any laptop, it goes above Alienware and even Apple, presenting a top notch looking device with the best Keyboard/Trackpad on the market.There are two minor details that I found.. 1) One of the Laptops had a clicking noise inside, as if a fan was hitting a piece of plastic, lasted for a few seconds but it was consistent. The Web camera is sub-par, in all fairness, the screen is good compared to the webcam.....Because of the clicking noise, I did call Amazon customer service and they were incredible, they shipped a new Razer overnight at their expense and arranged a pick-up for the replacement at my place... in short I had to do nothing at all to get the exchange in my hands, just a simple call.", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Take the online reviews with a grain of salt", "Author": "Faouzi B Achour", "ReviewID": "RJRJ51IZBY10F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have put off buying this system for a long time due to online reviews.  Finally, I bit the bullet and forked out the money for this thin beauty (I call mine Ray... and I pet it and feed it virus protected games from Steam).  The reason of putting off the purchase was all the reviews bashing the screen color and view angles.  Let me give a quick story of how I see this criticism.  When you go to Best Buy and see the wall of TVs, it is pretty easy to see better ones from less bright or less crisp ones.  But when you go home and look at your TV, it is just fine.  I am sure if you were to cart your TV into Best Buy, slap it on a wall, and look at it against the others, you would wish for a different screen.  However, your home is not filled with 60 TVs (at least mine is not).  So, you are quite happy watching The Big Bang Theory and The Bachelor.  That is how the Razer is.  The screen is perfectly fine.  It is bright, vibrant, fast, and I have no problem seeing colors on it.  I have a couple of IPS monitors hooked to my desktop, and I will say the desktop screens look a bit nicer, but once I move to the living room (or on the road), I have no comparison and am perfectly happy with the Razer.I also love the very fast boot times.  About a dozen seconds is all it takes to go from off to working.The power brick is also a thing of beauty.  I was toying with the Gigabyte P34G and this (the Gigabyte is almost $1000 cheaper).  But it had such bad reviews on fan noise, the power brick, and it does not have a 512GB SSD option.  I went the Razer route.I have something really bad to say about Razer.  They are like the pod people.  I am now hooked on their products.  Good quality control.And as for Amazon as a place to buy the Razer:  I did this due to my Prime membership (one day shipping was $6).  Amazon shipped the wrong unit at first (a 256gb SSD).  Amazon not only hastily fixed the issue (I got an email confirmation in less than 30 minutes from clicking the return button), but UPS picked up the old unit and handed me the new unit at the same time, two days later!  Gee... I love this Amazon company too.Bottom line, Razer Blade is expensive, but such a nice system.

I am selling my pimped out Origin EON15 S now that I've received this one.I go to college and I have big gaps in between classes so I wanted a laptop that I could bring with me to school, but still play games in between classes. This laptop weighs nothing (take into consideration I'm coming from the Origin) and on top of that, the brick is soo small. I hated bringing my Origin to school because the fans were loud and it just looks ridiculous when you place it on your desk to use microsoft word. I have a desktop at my house so there was no point in having a desktop-replacement-style laptop.The battery on this thing is insane. It lasts longer than my old 15\" Mid 2010 Macbook Pro which I always thought was really good. I get through 2 back to back classes and still have battery to spare. I've never seen a notification telling me that the battery was low.The thing that had me most reluctant to buying this was that I thought the screen was going to suck, but this is not the case. The screen is really good. Not crappy or just \"ok\" like many of the reviews say. The viewing angles bother me more than I thought they would have, but that's just because I can't sit still in class so I'm always adjusting the screen. Games look sharp and crisp and the color looks great as well.In terms of performance, the blade does everything I want from it. I mostly play League of Legends, which isn't a graphics intensive game, so I don't really push the computer. I recently installed Dishonored and Fable: Lost Chapters and it runs both of those really well. I average 90 fps on max everything, windowed-borderless in League of Legends. I could get 140 fps on my Origin, but I can fit 3 blades inside that laptop haha.Things that could be better:The laptop doesn't sit flush/flat on desks. It has a slight wobble that is pretty annoying.A magnetic charger would have been cool. I'm always paranoid that someone is going to trip over my cable and send it flying (who cares about the injured person).My Origin laptop had a key that turned off the trackpad which is really cool when I use a mouse (all the time) so my palm doesn't mess around with the trackpad at the same time the mouse is. You might be able to change this with razer synapse 2.0, but I haven't checked yet.I hate the fact that they stick the windows key on the bottom of the laptop and the intel sticker on the top of the inside of the laptop. I tried taking off those types of sticker before with little luck and this only seems worse because the finish of the laptop is matte. The intel sticker is also slightly crooked which makes my eye twitch.tl;dr The Razer Blade is amazing as an actually portable laptop that you carry around with you everywhere.

Unless you're trying to gather the whole family around and watch a movie on it, the less-than-competitors viewing angles are NOT A PROBLEM! (I'm sorry I shouted).-The design. The design. The design. Aesthetically speaking, I pat myself on the back every time I open this baby up. The great backlit keyboard, the font on the keys, the glowing Razer logo, the black all the way around... ohh man. I love this computer.-The trackpad works great. People seem to talk trash about the left and right click buttons, but I've honestly found them to be easy to get the hang of, and between being able to tap the track pad and using the keys, it's All good.In the end, if you're on the fence about the blade, just get it. You won't be disappointed. At least I wasn't.

This thing is a beast. I'm an engineer, so I do some CAD and FEA simulations, and this computer runs them faster than anything I've ever seen. In terms of gaming, it plays Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag on the highest graphics settings flawlessly. I'm amazed that Razer was able to get so much performance into such a small package. I even compared it to my friend's new Macbook Air, and the Razer Blade 14 is slightly thinner at the back edge (the Air is a wedge shape, while the Blade has a constant thickness).The only drawback to this laptop is the limited hard drive space because of the expensive SSD. My solution was to just buy a 2 TB external HDD (about $100) to store all my large media files. Also, this laptop has an extra mSATA slot for a 2nd SSD, so when my manufacturer warranty is up next year, I might pop it open and install another hard drive.Overall, I absolutely love the Razer Blade 14.

I have it running 2 27\" monitors as well as it's own 14\" screen on my desk and have had no problems. In order to connect the third display as well as wired ethernet I used a Diamond Multimedia USB303HE adapter with a Cable Matters SuperSpeed USB 3.0/2.0 to HDMI/DVI Adapter and it works like a charm. One wire to plug in and it has my keyboard, mouse, second 27\" monitor, and ethernet. Only other thing I plug in is my HDMI for the first 27\" monitor.So far the machine has been tested running Visual Studio 2013 for development, many many sessions of RDP concurrently, and other development tools. I have also tested it with World of Warcraft and League of Legends and it played them very well. The machine rarely makes a sound while sitting on my desk, but when on a lap you can hear the fan kick up a bit... but stays much cooler than my previous 17\" laptops if the vents aren't blocked.The touch pad works very well, as does the keyboard. The only issue I have experienced was with the wireless dropping connections at my home office, but it appears to be an issue with the wireless router more than the card.

If you buy this to have a light and slim laptop to play games and maybe do some other stuff then this is the one to get.Build quality is excellent, the only exception is chintzy touchpad buttons, but it is certainly not a deal breaker.I don't understand complaints about the display. Yes it is a TN display and it is 1600 x 900. Here's the thing - once again, if you buy this laptop to play games then this is the right screen. Yes, we are getting more and more 120 Hz IPS monitors and G-sync is on the way, so in 2 years we will have similar laptops with much better screens, but for now TN is the way to go. Same about resolution - this laptop has Geforce 765M and this is about as much resolution as it can handle in modern games. I'd rather have a lower res screen and play with better framerate at native resolution as opposed to playing at non-native resolution and slow frame rates or with greatly decreased visual quality. \\So far quite happy with it because I wanted to play Borderlands 2 and Metro-Last Light on the go and Razer Blade 14 certaily delivers.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "At last", "Author": "Zin Zon", "ReviewID": "R17DFJP8GPZVIL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Backstory: I needed an upgrade from my aging 2011 Samsung QX-411-W01US, a 14-incher with 1366x768 screen and GeForce 520M that was getting sluggish. My next laptop had to be lighter, have a better GPU, 14\", and not be junk. Over the past few months, I've been obsessively reading reviews and checking prices. Before trying this 2013 Blade, I purchased four laptops. I had to refund each one of them. I went through two Acer Aspire V7-482PGs, the Gigabyte P34G, and the newest P34G v2.Each one has some defect, glaring omission, or flaw that makes its price tag questionable. Long story short, Acer and Gigabyte's build quality left much to be desired, particularly their builds and touchpads. It's sad, but if you want a Windows laptop with a good GPU, the options all suck.Except this one.You probably already know that the 2013 Razer Blade 14 got almost everything perfect, except for the screen, and perhaps the high cost. So I'll comment on the screen. Before ordering it, I looked at every video review I could find, read every forum thread. It seemed most people fell into one of three buckets:1. The screen is horrible and I'm regretting/returning it due to A. 900p and not 1080p B. poor color gamut C. limited viewing angles2. The screen is acceptable, could be better for how expensive it is, but I'll keep it3. The screen is awesomeI fall somewhere between 2 and 3. With all the criticism, I was expecting the worst, but I'm baffled at how bad a reputation the screen has. Admittedly I'm much more audiophile than videophile, but to me it looks plenty colorful and sharp, and I do not see any problems with washed-out colors or unviewable screen angles that so many complained about. It beats my older Samsung next to it, though that's anecdotal. If you move it to a vertical angle that you'd never use it at, then yes, colors get inverted. I don't know who uses a monitor at such weird angles, and I don't know how this got so blown up.Where to begin with the positives? It's all positive. It's slender and sexy. The neon green keys and triskelion logo glowing against the inky ebony finish are to die for. The touchpad is big, comfy, and has ample tweakability in its software. The other laptops I refunded had touchpads so awful I felt like I was in the stone age trying to browse the web with them. I use an external mouse ~75% of the time, but if I'm spending over $1000 on a laptop, the touchpad needs to be stellar. This one is. It's butter, and for what this costs, it needs to be.Oh, and it plays all those mindless video games we love, at extremely high levels of detail. I don't know why it's so hard for manufacturers to make physically great laptops with good GPUs, but Razer's on to something here. The 2013 Blade is truly unique, historic, and game-changing in this regard. I've never been a brand loyalist, but Razer have earned my respect and attention.If the screen disappointed me, I may have refunded it and considered the 2014 model. But it's almost $3000 after tax if you want the reasonable 512GB storage (2014 is sadly non-upgradeable, but 2013 has an extra mSATA slot). This one rocks, and it will satisfy me for at least the next 2 years. And I can't even imagine what Razer will have come up with by then.", "Date": "May 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Incredible Machine, Minor Day 1 Bugs", "Author": "Beach Boy", "ReviewID": "R1PW02ONJKTO8L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is absolutely insane. It is thin, very sturdy, gorgeous to look at, and blazing fast. This thing loads everything so fast, boots up, and shuts down very quickly. It is an absolute joy to use. All this power doesn't mean a sacrifice in battery life either. This thing lasts for a really long time. I'm still amazed at how all of this power can be fit in such a thin package. It is a really thin laptop and the smooth aluminum feels great to the touch. The stereo speakers on either side of the keyboard are surprisingly loud and sound great as far as laptop speakers go. The keyboard is great for typing and the adjustable backlighting is perfect for any environment. The trackpad has built in gesture support that makes using Windows 8.1 a great experience even though there isn't a touch screen. There has been a lot of discussion about the screen on this laptop, and while it is definitely the weakest link, it isn't terrible. Yes, viewing angles aren't very good, but that's about where the bad things end. The colors are good, the screen gets very bright, and even though it only packs a 1600x900 resolution, everything looks very crisp due to the 14 inch screen size. It comes with 3 USB ports, an HDMI, and a headphone jack, and all work great.There are a few things you should know before buying this laptop. First of all, if you are buying the laptop with Windows 8.1, the very first thing you need to do is update the wireless card driver. The one that ships with the laptop is incompatible with Windows 8.1 and causes connectivity issues, but even worse causes major problems putting the machine to sleep, shutting down, and rebooting. That said, as soon as the driver is updated, everything runs perfectly. Sleeping, restarting, shutting down, and booting up all happen in the blink of an eye. My only other complaint is that one of the fans (there are two on this laptop, one for the cpu and one for the gpu) can make a very faint noise, as if it is not aligned right. This issue may be limited to my machine, and it is barely noticeable. If you are older you may not even hear it because it is pretty high pitched. Again, this is a very very minor issue and will not bother you 99.9% of the time. I can only hear it if I am in a dead silent room and I am listening for it.Overall I highly recommend this laptop, especially due to the lowered price. It is the best experience I have had on any computer I have ever used.Pros: Super fast processor, gpu, wireless card, and ssd. Touchpad gestures for Windows 8.1. Thin, solid design. Adjustable backlit keyboard. Stereo speakers. Great battery life. Bright, crisp screen.Cons: Wireless card driver causes big problems until you update it (which doesn't take too long and all problems are solved once updated). Very minor fan noise issues.

Schievenin", "ReviewID": "RIPBM643STYFF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Keyboard and Touchpad: 10/10Razer is known for it's keyboards, and the quality shines here. The built-in mechanical keyboard is tailored for the device, coming with full-size buttons for the standard letter keys for typing purposes while tinkering with the sizes of the function and arrow keys to suit the form-factor. Typing took no extra effort or time to learn, which is highly unusual for me on a keyboard with any resized buttons. It's a very smart design, though it is missing a scroll lock button. The touchpad has dedicated left and right mouse buttons that make a light clicking noise when pressed, and the pad itself supports multi-touch gestures.Screen: 5/10Hands-down the worst part of the laptop, the screen comes at a relatively low resolution for a gaming laptop (1600x1200). I multibox on World of Warcraft, and found that running two windows 800x600 was just too small to work with. Eventually I settled for a 400x300 and a 1200x900 solution controlled with scripts that might be a bit complex for the average consumer. The resolution is more than capable of running a full-screened game and looking good, and the dedicated NVIDIA card ensures that you can run most games on the highest graphics settings at this reduced resolution. Even then, though, the viewing angles are very narrow. Moving your head out of the ideal angle will immediately make the colors of the screen seem washed out. It's more than capable for playing games solo, but any local multiplayer or splitscreen games will require someone to play without the right colors from the viewing angle. Same goes for watching youtube videos with a friend.Sound: 10/10The speakers are large, and well-placed by the keyboard. I'm not an audiophile, but they seemed to produce great sound to me. The fans are very quiet, and don't engage until under stress. My desktop makes much more noise while gaming than my laptop, which is a first for me.Graphics Processing: 10/10The included NVIDIA GeForce GTX 765M was top of the line for gaming laptops when released in 2013, and it holds up well to date. The system had no problems running multiple instances of World of Warcraft at whatever graphics settings I wanted.Computer Processing and RAM: 10/108gb is more than enough RAM to game on for any game I can think of at the moment. Since the PS4 sports the same amount of RAM, you can expect games ported to PC to support the system's specs for the foreseeable future. The 8 core processor is slightly better than what's available on 'next-gen' consoles.Portability: 10/10The Razer Blade is SLIM. Definitively the slimmest laptop I've ever owned, and thinner than even most Macbooks I've seen. For a gaming laptop, this is about as small as it gets. The razer logo in the back is noticeable, but not to the point that I'd be embarrassed to bring this to work or to a library.Accessibilty: 7/10In order to achieve the small form factor, some compromises had to be made in terms of built-in ports and connections. First and foremost: THERE IS NO ETHERNET PORT. The laptop was simply too thin to put one in. A USB to Ethernet adapter must be purchased separately for wired internet services. To make up for this, the included wi-fi card has been modified to prioritize gaming connections over other uses of the internet. I really don't understand how the card works beyond prioritizing gaming connections, but have experienced FAR less disconnections than my desktop and previous laptops on my home wifi network while multiboxing, and can game without any issue with a single instance running on the wifi card. No disk drive or card slots are included either, though an HDMI port and 3 USB 3.0 ports are squeezed into the sides of the system.Hard Drive:10/10The first time you experience a Solid State Drive feels like stepping into a Star Trek episode. The computer loads instantly, and files transfer and install FAST. The 256 gb is smaller than other gaming laptops, so if you like to have your entire game library installed and ready to go, an external drive may be necessary. Personally, this was more than enough space for me to play with, and the speed was worth the trade-off.Heat: 9/10The Razer Blade does a great job of keeping the flow of heat expected of a gaming laptop away from the keyboard, though the space between the keyboard and the screen does get hot to the touch. After several hours of multibox gaming, my maximum temperature of the CPU reached 84 degrees Celsius, with the GPU clocking in just under 60 degrees. That's safe but hotter than ideal for a CPU, and surprisingly cool for a laptop GPU under pressure. A separate integrated graphics card takes over when the user isn't gaming, which caused temperatures to fall 15-20 degrees within a minute or two of closing down all games. When using a web browser and nothing else, the NVIDIA Graphics is completely powered off, falling to room temperature. The CPU hovers around 45 degrees Celsius for me.Tilt (Personal affection and other): 10/10The Razer Blade feels wonderful. The Aluminum case is cool to the touch, and the build quality of the machine is the best I've ever seen. Razer has taken heavy inspiration from Apple products, but improved the power of the internals and made the system slimmer without sacrificing the ability to type for productivity. Incidentally, the laptop comes with next to no pre-installed software. No trials versions of vaporware or antivirus software, just Razer Synapse (a program for multitouch gestures) and Razer Comms (a skype-like gaming chat service). It's a bit refreshing to open a new computer to a clean desktop, without the need to uninstall Nortan or Mcaffee in favor of my preferred antivirus of choice.Summary and Score: 91/100It's a beautiful machine that runs like a dream. I wish the screen was a higher resolution with better viewing angles, and having a laptop without an ethernet port feels strange, but the form factor and raw power are best in class for it's size, the noise is minimal, and the keyboard is impressive. This is as small as gaming laptops get without sacrificing your ability to play or use the system for work, and I don't regret the purchase at all.

I definitely love Razer Blade. This computer definitely worth $1500. I was in between buying this one or the new 2014 version. I didn't want to give $900 for a new graphics card 870m (which is not even Maxwell) and an QHD+ (which some reviews say still not perfect). If they made new one with 860m maxwell and a perfect 1080p screen I would buy the new one but again it is up to you.ScreenI was waiting for a screen that is really bad, I mean \"really\" bad but it is actually quite good. I am not saying it is perfect or something but it is definitely not the worst screen I have ever seen. If you can't decide between this one and the new blade I can guarantee you that you won't feel bad buying this one.That being said it is not perfect.It is a great laptop overall but the problem with mine is in the power adapter. I did not encounter with any problems in the US but when I moved to Turkey for business, my adapter started making buzzing sound when plugged in. I think this might have to do with 220v. Again it is just a buzzing sound but if you care for this kind of stuff then it will bother you. I contacted with Razer and they told me that it is normal. It is hard to hear so that won't bother me.Other Thoughts:I will be waiting for Intel Skylake Cpus and Nvidia graphics cards with the ability to run games on native 4K resolution with high settings.
