Handren", "ReviewID": "R1G9P35S2NOHYV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought an S431 from another Amazon vendor and it arrived with a defective 22GB SSD used for the Intel Rapid Storage Technology. An opened computer cannot be returned you must use the manufacturer's warranty process. A replacement chip was sent by Lenovo but it was not partitioned with the required \"hibernation\" partition needed for the Intel RST. Also, since the recovery disks are made from the data on this SSD drive from the factory I would not trust them to be accurate. I sent it to the Lenovo repair center, at least 3 techs looked at it (each time you call for information they \"escalate the problem to engineering\" which is doublespeak for it goes to another tech). It was sent back worse than when I gave it to them, both the HDD and SSD were partitioned much different than factory settings and nop \"Hibernation\" partition at all. They dodged the issue by running a complete automated hardware test and told me it is fixed. Their techs have no clue or ability on how to partition the SSD properly, I have no recovery disks, I don't have the machine I paid for.I will never touch a Lenovo product again.", "Date": "April 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome laptop!", "Author": "Science Guy \"MP\"", "ReviewID": "R34VASG6Z5O1NQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use a Thinkpad at work and it is excellent.  We bought this one for our daughter as her college computer.  I changed out the 500gb drive for an SSD and used the Windows 7.  Awesome!  Thin, lightweight and super fast.  Don't forget that it doesn't have an optical drive.
