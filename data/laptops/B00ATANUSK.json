{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Worst imaginable warranty service", "Author": "Professor", "ReviewID": "R2IVTFSQJHJOGA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop because it is a full powered laptop, yet very light weight.  But it had some problems new out of the box.  I called up for warranty service, spoke to people in the Philippines, and sent it to them to their repair station in Grapevine Texas.  After 3 weeks I called to complain, and then at 4 weeks, I finally got it.  Now it is far worse broken than when I sent it in. They broke far more than they fixed. So I immediately sent it back.  It has now been over three weeks (a total of over seven weeks).  I have been calling and calling.  I get promises of call backs, but that never happens.They have almost had it longer than me.  It has never worked 100% for me.I notice that they do not sell this model any more, and to have a model on the market for such a short time can only mean that it is a lemon.  And one that obviously can not be repaired.  I think that I should be sent a new machine, one that is a different model and is not so problematic and can be repaired when it needs to be.  I have owned many other machines and have never had problems like this.  In fact, I think that this is the only machine that I have ever had that broke.Any company can have a machine or product that breaks.  How they handle it tells one much about them.  And this story is not good.  Over seven weeks now and who knows how long it will be.  No one ever gets back to me.  And imagine breaking my machine when they had it there for repair.  It is totally worthless now.Now for the end of the story.I could not get them to reply to my phone calls or emails, so I filed a formal complaint with the BBB.  That put me in contact with someone who was polite and communicative.  He offered me the following 3 choices:1) a 75% refund of my money2) a Lenovo Z4003) a Lenovo Z500#1 was too much of a hit.  #2 internet reviews showed that it had problems with both the wifi and the battery charging.  #3 was pulled from all of the normal sellers and was now available at a very low price at the bargainsRus and Deals4U type web sites.  In my mind, it was an offer to go from the frying pan to the fire.Fortunately, the store where I bought it told me to bring it back and they would give me full credit in store for anything that I wanted.  I told this nice person at Lenovo to send it back to me.  It was now ten weeks that they have had this unit for repair.It came back, and the paper said that everything was fixed. Maybe it is all fixed and I should keep it?  I opened it up and the big trim ring around the screen fell off.  Not a good start.  Then the Lenovo button was jammed in, totally non operational.  At this point I just said, enough is enough, I put it back in the box and took it back to the store.  I bought an Asus instead and am very happy with it.", "Date": "September 24, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$559.99", "Features": "Intel Core i3-3227U ULV Processor (1.9 GHz)\n4 GB DDR3 RAM\n500 GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive\n14-Inch Screen, Integrated Intel HD Graphics\nWindows 8, 5-hour battery life", "Name": "Lenovo IdeaPad S400 14-Inch Laptop (Gray)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415B2IgD8AL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00ATANUSK"}}
