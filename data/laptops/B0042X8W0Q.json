{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Superb travel lap top", "Author": "C. Winton \"cwinton\"", "ReviewID": "R22J22SPB5GB81", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I do my serious computing at home on a well-appointed desk top and when traveling need a laptop that can at least handle the kinds of work I perform with my desktop.  For the past 2 years I used a Dell XPS M1330 for this purpose and came to literally loathe the machine (heavy and unreliable, with disappointing performance), which ended my respect for Dell and sent me looking elsewhere for something more to my liking.  To see if I could get along with a smaller machine I first tried traveling with a $200 netbook, which I found to be simply too weak for my needs; however, I found the light weight and small size to be a major plus, so I went on the prowl for the same kind of form factor in a powerful machine, which led me eventually to the 1380T.  At present there aren't many machines in this category, and from what I could tell from specs and user comments, this one is at the top of the list at the present time, which is why I bought one.  There has been nothing from my experience to date to indicate otherwise and in fact, my shift to the Acer 1380T (I7 CPU) from the Dell has been like coming up for fresh air, a five star experience.I've had this unit for about a month now and to date have taken it on one serious road trip, which has demonstrated the machine is all I had hoped for, and actually a good bit more.  Other reviewers have thoroughly gone through what this machine has to offer so I will limit myself to what I have found useful.1.  It has handled everything I do with my desktop (something I could not say for the Dell) - let me hasten to add I don't do games, which may need a dedicated graphics card for best effect (Asus has a machine in this class that such users might consider, although why one would want to play those kinds of games on a machine this small is beyond me)2.  It runs cool and has a very long battery life (my initial read is that it will easily go 8 or 9 hours when all you are doing is routine text processing kinds of stuff, about 4 times as long as the Dell)3.  It is in that magic weight range of around 3 lbs and its thickness and weight are not amplified by the battery (unlike many other laptops)4.  The screen is excellent (others have carped about viewing angle, but for a single user it is great, and in this size range, isn't that what matters?)5.  I actually like the \"chiclet\" key board, which has \"homing\" ridges on the f and j keys that help with touch typing ... I find individual key size to actually be substantial, and touch type at least as easily on this keyboard as the one I have at home ... maybe I have a light touch, but I don't notice any keyboard flex others seem to sense6.  The machine feels substantial, even with all the plastic (which I'm sure holds weight down)7.  The charger does not use a proprietary input, is light, consisting of a single wall wart with a configurable plug (for which you can get alternatives for other country's outlets), configurable meaning you can position the prongs for horizontal or vertical (and it's a 2 prong non-polarized plug) - my guess is that the total travel package is a good 2 lbs under the Dell.Are there annoyances?  There is the usual bloatware, but no worse than what I've experienced with other vendors ... it just means spending some time removing or disabling it. There is no optical drive, but that's a weight trade-off, and after honestly examining my usage patterns, I couldn't even remember the last time I required one on a trip.  I have a perfectly good $50 Samsung external USB that works just fine for the rare occasions I have to do something with that almost outmoded technology.My one peeve with Acer is their not supplying system reinstall media, expecting users to create their own.  It took 1.25 hours to produce the 4 DVDs their on board utility produces from the partition on the hard disk they have set aside with this content.  My advice, start it going while you are watching TV or reading a book and just be prepared for it to take awhile.  It would be nice if Acer would set this up so you could create a bootable USB or flash instead.Surprises?  From other reviews I expected to have issues with the touch pad, but have not at all.  I've always hated touch pads because I somehow manage to hit them with my thumb at the wrong time with annoying effects, but not this one.  Otherwise, it seems to work no better or worse than any other I've used across a spectrum of manufacturers.  I also like having less palm space, since I've come to believe that is something that helps to keep my thumbs away from the touch pad.My other surprise was with the built-in Bluetooth.  I have an old Palm TX that has information I wanted to sync onto this machine, only to find USB sync for Win 7 x64 is not being supported by Palm software.  A little investigation indicated I might be able to sync via Bluetooth.  Sure enough, once enabled, both devices located each other and sync just worked.  Incidentally, if you are new to x64 you too will likely find that some of your older apps won't run without an upgrade to a 64-bit version (sometimes this is just a question of needing to locate a 64-bit driver, but some apps do things that are incompatible with 64-bit architecture).I have not used an external monitor with this machine (yet) and don't have any particular reason to use hdmi or sound I/O, so check what other reviewers have to say if those are important to you.  The card reader is the usual for this type of machine and having a hot key for enabling/disabling wi-fi or Bluetooth is definitely more user friendly than the physical switch Dell supplied.All in all, Acer has managed to wrap a lot of very nice stuff into a very small package.  From my first month of usage, I believe it to be by far the best of the dozen or so laptops I've worked with over the years.January 18 - update - OK, I've now really put this machine through some heavy lifting.  For a week long workshop I was involved in, I used this laptop for extensive editing of PowerPoint slides.  Presentation files ranged from a couple of slides to over 500, and sometimes I had maybe as many as 10 of them open cutting and pasting to a master.  I also had Adobe Photoshop and Acrobat open at various points, not to mention Outlook, Excel, and web browsers.  The machine never crashed.  Every now and then I noted a bit of a pause when the system's power misering required spinning the hard drive back up, so a SSD might be worth considering, although this was a minor annoyance.  I forgot my charger and went my first day on battery alone without running dry, at least 5 hours of serious use including internet for a chunk of the time.  It may be of interest that the generic nature of the charge port allowed me to use a colleague's (for an Aspire one netbook), which while a bit less potent was sufficient to restore full charge in a few hours.  The final presentation had notes on each slide and apparently PowerPoint writes to pdf in image form if you ask for notes, which showed one non-gaming reason reason for having a graphics card.  It took the machine quite a bit of time to do it.  An app we worked on had a bug that was revealed because the CPU evidently runs a good bit faster than Intel's integrated graphics processor.  On the other hand, Photoshop runs perfectly fine (at least for the kinds of editing I typically do).  As for using projectors and external monitors, the machine brought both up effortlessly and automatically (Casio projector, miscellaneous monitor).  For airplane usage and travel, it is the perfect size for today's cramped seating, even room on the tray table for my nano mouse.  I managed to get along OK with the touchpad for routine stuff, but when it came to extended or precision work, I pulled out my nano mouse.  Communications and networking were flawless, across multiple variations of network configurations.  One more thing that may be of interest to some, the built-in mic can be set to pass through via Sound in the control panel, which means if you plug in an external mic and hook up a set of powered speakers, the machine can easily be used as a quick and dirty PA system (my last Dell system did this quite poorly - this one is quite good).There is nothing about the machine to change my review, except to note it is proving to be even better than I originally thought.", "Date": "December 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great connectivity", "Author": "Sam", "ReviewID": "R2PPOHJIQYBTC4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think the other reviewers have done a brilliant job and I fully agree with their assessments. I would only add the following points regarding ports......I was all set to buy an 11.6\" Airbook. That plan came to a screeching halt when I discovered that it didn't have an Ethernet port. The best you could do was to buy a separate USB dongle that would provide 10/100 Ethernet. For an IT professional who is used to walking into a client's server room and taking a 50GB backup copy of a database in no time via gigabit ehternet that was just not going to work out. I don't fancy stepping back to 1990! Also a lot of hotels only have wired Ethernet and I just want to be able to plug in and go. Not spend time playing find-the-adapter.I also found out that the Airbook has a mini DisplayPort. To plug into an external VGA monitor you need (yep, you guessed it) another adapter. To plug into a TV or projector you need yet another adapter for HDMI. All these are sold separately and are more junk to cart around the world. They are also the exact thing that you would find that you have lost (or left back in the hotel) just when you needed to plug into a projector to give a presentation ;)So I was all set to lay out serious $$$ on a Sony ultra-portable when I came across the TimelineX. I've had it for a month now and I couldn't be happier with it. For the professional on the road that doesn't want to lug around some 15.6\" monster this little guy is the perfect replacement. Compared to the Sony ultra-portables the price is outstanding value.", "Date": "December 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Perfect choice!", "Author": "Josh", "ReviewID": "R2X9497AZMRH0L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just purchased this laptop as a portable solution to my Dell Studio, and i have to say that this is the first laptop that i have ever purchased, and as an IT professional I purchase quite a few, that has exceeded all expectations! I often work with demanding applications such as Adobe Premier CS5, Autodesk 3DS Max 2010, and Maya, and have to say that this machine is able to run them without any issues. Now im not saying this is a replacement for a desktop powerhouse system for heavy graphics editing and such but it is nice to have a small portable rig capable of opening these files and making modifications on the go. Now unsurprisingly this machine only rates a Windows Experience Index of 3.5 due solely to the fact there is no dedicated graphics card, but come on, if your seriously purchasing this with hopes of gaming in mind chances are your not even doing enough research to even be reading this review. But any way more about the product; upon first glance when taking this machine out of its box, and i say machine because i dare not call a system this powerful a \"netbook\", is \"Wow, an i7 in this? Really?\". Well lets get one thing straight, iX is a technology, not a specific model series of processors, but it does pack one heck of a surprising punch for a machine this size. As stated above I can easily run some of todays most demanding apps without any problems, and the 4GB of DDR3 RAM is quite handy! And for once, a battery life as advertised! with radios off and screen dimmed but still easily readable i got a 7+ hour life while doing normal operations such as email and word processing. Now obviously battery life drops when you do more demanding tasks, so as a comparison I am currently writing this review from this laptop with WiFi ON, music playing, screen brightness all the way up, and installing a game in the background and my battery life is just above 5 hrs!!! Now how many systems can claim that! Some people have made a couple small comments about a small amount of flex in the keyboard, and it is true, the keyboard does flex maybe a mm or so, but it is not noticeable unless looking at the kb whilst typing, otherwise i find the response and feedback of the keyboard pleasantly comfortable, and the layout is great and you should have no issues typing on it as the dimensions are very close to a full keyboards dimensions with the exception of a few keys such as arrows, but you can get used to that.Overall I must say that this machine is well worth the money and having now used it, I would have happily paid a hundred or two more for it!", "Date": "January 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Poor Quality", "Author": "Math Lover", "ReviewID": "RT3JT06X49J6Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had this laptop for less than a year and it is still under warranty.  I have already sent it in twice to be fixed.  The first time was because of a crashing issue and the second time was because a group of pixels in the LCD screen died.  Each time I had to pay for shipping and was without a computer for more than a week.My real issue is that after getting the laptop back from the pixels issue, less than two days later more pixels died.  I called ACER customer support and they told me that I would have to pay for the screen to be replaced this time even though the laptop was still under warranty.  I find it unacceptable to be required to pay to replace something that they were just supposed to have fixed two days ago!  I also think that having to send a laptop in for servicing 3 times in less than a year is unreasonable.", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Road warrior!  ***RAM & SSD Upgrade*** UPDATE", "Author":

I need a computer I can leave in the car trunk or carry in a fanny pack while shooting assignments, so it has to be tough, compact and powerful. The Acer Aspire TimelineX AS1830T-68U118 solved the problem of cramming near-desktop power into a Netbook-sized package. I've only had it for a few weeks, but here are my impressions:EXTERIOR:1. Not as pretty as a Macbook Air, but what is? It also costs less.2. The tough exterior has a nice texture that is easy to grip and shrugs off fingerprints. The Acer power brick weighs just seven ounces; half the size and weight of my old laptop brick.3. The 11.6\" glossy screen looks great so long as you view it \"on axis.\" The Acer runs at 1366 by 768, 32 bit, 60 Hertz. The 128 MB dedicated video memory is a bottleneck if you are a gamer or want to do video editing. I watched a movie using an external DVD player with no problem, though. The frame contains a fixed user-facing web cam and mike.4. Unlike the MacBook Air, the compact TimeLineX AS1830T is loaded with three USB 2.0 ports, a HDMI port, and an old-style VGA monitor socket! The built-in multi-card reader will take SD cards, but not CF cards.5. There is no built-in optical drive. No PCMCIA slot.6. People complain about the touch pad; they're right. I forgot my mouse one day and it was marginally less painful than smashing my forehead against the keyboard until I pass out. NOTE: I uninstalled the Alps touchpad software and it actually works better.UNDER THE HOOD:1. Computers this size rarely contain the powerful i7-680UM processor. It easily runs high-end programs under Win 7 64-bit Home Premium with Service Pack 1. Bloatware wasn't too bad.2. It comes with 4 GB of DDR3 RAM. I bumped this up to 8 gigabytes, but honestly, I couldn't see much difference. It's just that RAM is so cheap!3. It has WiFi, Bluetooth and Ethernet connectivity. I haven't used the Bluetooth, so can't say much about it. On field assignments with no WiFi access I've transmitted photos to clients though my Android cellphone using two methods: as a WiFi hotspot and using PdaNet with a USB tether. Easy--no issues.4. This Acer contains a roomy 500 GB hard drive. Curiously, they chose a slower 5400 RPM HD, though it seems plenty fast. I assume they opted for it to maximize battery life.5. Which highlights the TimelineX AS1830T remarkable battery life. I spent the first day continuously loading software, updates, rebooting, testing and interfacing my programs. Even with the WiFi on and the screen at maximum brightness, the Acer still had a few gasps of power after five solid hours of heavy lifting. Sweet!IN USE:1. The boot time to the first Windows musical tone is 55 seconds. Much slower than a MacBook Air's SSD boot time. (Read the \"SSD UPDATE\" at the end of this review, though.)2. The Aspire TimelineX AS1830T easily runs the full-on Photoshop CS6 64-bit, PhotoMechanic, Firefox and other programs simultaneously. Massive Canon 5DII RAW files load in CS6 in about six seconds. Not as good as my desktop, but excellent for field work.BOTTOM LINE:The TimelineX is powerful, small and affordable with remarkable battery life. As an added bonus, Acer designed this machine for easy user upgrades:----------SSD UPDATE----------Some users turn their TimelineX into an Ultrabook by swapping out the hard drive for a rugged, ultra-fast solid state hard drive (SSD). Both the RAM and the hard drive are easily accessible under a single clearly-marked panel attached with five standard Phillips screws.I installed both a Crucial 256 GB m4 SSD and 8 GB of RAM in this Acer Aspire TimelineX. Holy smokes, what an easy and worthwhile upgrade! Boot time is now just 30 seconds, but the big news was Photoshop CS6. It performs heavy duty image processing in 1/2 to 1/3 the time! Battery life is extended, it runs cooler and quieter, and the laptop is more shock resistant. It now compares to my very powerful desktop computer and is STILL cheaper than a MacBook Air. If you can afford this upgrade, do it! I turned the original 500 GB hard drive into an external hard drive with a Vantec NexStar TX 2.5-Inch SATA to USB 2.0 External Hard Drive Enclosure for about ten bucks.I posted a video on cloning and installing the SSD and RAM into this laptop. This was my first cloning/replacement/upgrade and it was a piece of cake.By the way, there is a higher quality You Tube post available that Amazon won't let me link. Search \"How to install a SSD into a TimelineX laptop\" on You Tube. Beware--the audio kinda sux. I bought a good mike after I shot this.--------------------------------UPDATE: I've been using this souped-up laptop for over a year now and have been very pleased with my purchase. Small and powerful, it really kicks bootie! Absolutely no issues. There are some neat new ultrabooks out there now, so do your homework. But even the best will have a hard time beating this machine.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Light, Small, yet Powerfull", "Author": "D.

Therefore, instead of repeating what has already been written, I will simply comment on my experiences and what others have said.I've found that most of the complaints others have had about such things as the keyboard and small touchpad are minor. Every computer feels different and simply takes getting accustom to. Let me address a few of these things now. I either still own or have tried 17, 15, 13 and 10 inch laptops from Dell, HP, Acer and Mac. Every one of them has their good and bad points and takes practice especially on the keyboard. Every time I switch to another computer, I have to be aware of the slightly different layout and key sizes then readjust my typing as not to hit the wrong keys too often.I've tried a 10 inch notebook but found it just a little too small. Even this Timeline at times seems too small on the print or online. So, I just simply zoom in when need be.As for the small touchpad, I haven't had a problem with it. Most of the time I use a wireless mouse in combination with the touchpad. It's just as I've said before, it takes practice and patience to get the hang of it.I bought this little wonder to use in the field. I needed something small, lightweight, long battery life yet powerful. This laptop fit the bill perfectly. I also have an extremely heavy 17 inch that I actually use on my lap. This Acer Timeline has the same specs as my main laptop. So, now I am considering using this Acer as my main everyday computer.As for what I do on a computer, well a little bit of everything. I do the usual things such as word processing, spreadsheets and surf the web. Then I also edit photos and design elements on websites. I even create and edit videos. This little machine handles all these tasks with ease.The left bottom side gets a little warm, but not warm enough to be uncomfortable. The only complaint I have is the screen has a dead pixel almost in the center which is distracting at times. Acer allows 18 dead pixels on the resolution of this computer and therefore will not replace it. I could have returned it to Amazon, but I have already spent hours putting all my files and programs on it. I can only hope that I can just get use to it.Otherwise, if you want a powerful yet highly portable computer, then this is the one to buy.Update:There ended up being 4 dead pixels which drove me crazy. It was like a tiny person shinning a micro flashlight in my face. I just couldn't take it any longer. And since Acer wouldn't do anything about it, I returned it and bought a ASUS 13\" Bamboo which I love.", "Date": "January 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Overall Great Laptop", "Author": "helpanoobout", "ReviewID": "R18XS5VVWUX7SU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'll keep it simple. Here are my pro's/con's:Pro's:-Extremely light and portable. I have no problem carrying this baby around in one hand and it doesn't feel cheap either, rather it feels very durable.-Screen is amazing (indoors)-HDMI port: Makes for easy streaming of netflix, youtube, etc on your big screen TV.  This is one of the best features! The picture quality blows away using an VGA cable.-Fast/reliable: Turns on quickly and shuts down quickly. Able to multitask between varies programs. I do a lot of excel modeling while running a bunch of other programs in the background and this is able to do the job with ease.Con's:-The speakers are on the bottom of the laptop. This means the speaker volume is incredibly quiet! When I hold the laptop upside down the sound is actually loud! This means that there is a big waste of energy to output that increased volume (you will have to have it at max volume), yet it will still seem quiet to you. This is my biggest peeve of the laptop.-Small trackpad: It's not as bad as everything thinks but it's not the best either. I think it is manageable (but I have small hands). The scroll function is too sensitive so don't even plan on using that but the arrow keys on the keyboard work fine for me.-Glossy Screen: As with all glossy screens, you get some glare with sunlight. I think this is just an inherent problem with glossy screens but it definately makes the screen look better indoors.Overall a great laptop.

No longer. What it seems acer tried to do with this laptop was put the most powerful processor available with good graphics and memory in a package that wasn't going to cost a million dollars, and they did it. This is the best laptop with the best processor I've owned, and recently I have owned or still own a samsung i5 7 series slate, an asus eee i5 slate, a motion computing i5 fv5 rugged tablet, a gigabyte s1080, and a dell Inspiron duo. You get the idea, I like to try these gadgets out. I also have the iPad 2 and iPod touch devices. The timelinex functions perfectly. I have not experienced any problems with the touchpad, but I can see two reasons why others might have. This touch supports multitouch gestures, meaning you can use it like a touchscreen (almost). Double tap it, and it's the same as a left click. Also, the sensitivity is adjustable in windows settings. I have also loaded bluestacks android apps for windows, which means I have the equivalent of an android/windows dual device, with an i7 processor :-).  This laptop also is one of the few you can buy form less than $1000 which will run the google app biodigital human body, a very intensive graphics app. What are the worst features of this terrific machine? They had to make the build quality more like the apple iPad instead of the asus zenbook. So what? Still adequate for everyday use, and once again, go price i7 devices which don't do as much as thIs one.

Did some hd video editing that really pushed the cpu to its limits, but didn't over heat or crashed as my previous machine. Handles multiple tasks at once nicely. The screen is awesome, though have yet to see any dead pixels (just hope I don't jinx it) and with 3 usb ports, it meets all my everyday needs. Fairly quite, so it wont disturb anyone in class, even under high cpu usuage, it humms a lil bit, but not noisy. My major complaint is the track pad feels a lil generic and the multi touch gestures are not as responsive as the mac air, to me it seems like a last minute thing acer just tacked on. There are times when I literally had to tap my finger on the side of the track pad just so it would register a scroll.  Furthermore, due to its lack of a dedicated graphics, don't think about playing much graphic intensive games. I was able to push out 6-7 hours on high lighting from playing games, video editing, and internet surfing. The web cam is very basic and speakers are oddly under the machine, so sound isn't going to be too high in quality. For those of you that need something to just pull out and do a few online problems, school intensive assignments, photo or video editing, or even watch some hd movies on the go, this lap top is great. 4 gb of ram, up to 2.53 ghz with turbo boost, its pretty decent for its size. Be nice if it had a decent graphics card, but with a machine this small, I don't think playing big titles would be ideal. for roughly 650, its probably the biggest bang for your buck as far as ultra portables.

I wanted something small, but it still had to be reasonably fast.I knew these ultra portables are generally slow, so I decided to put in an OCZ Vertex 2 SSD to see if that would help.  Did it ever!!Out of the box, the system is kinda slow.  I loaded it up and removed a lot of the bloatware and disabled unneccessary services.  Then I timed the boot up.  It took 55 seconds to boot.Then, I replaced the hard drive with an OCZ Vertex 2 SSD drive and loaded Windows 7.  I timed the boot up again, and it dropped to 23 seconds!

I am considering upgrading RAM to 8GB, but haven't seen the need yet.- Easy to upgrade- i7 processor is great addition to a netbook.  Atoms are cheap, but just too slow- Amazon has great price.

So even though it comes out of suspend quickly, you then have to hit FN + F3 and then use the cursor to click on WiFi. I've tried every setting I can think of but to no avail. I'd love to edit this review if someone can tell me how to fix this. It seems to be a lot of extra steps to have to do for a device that's primary purpose is an easy way to access the Net.The track pad, at least mine, has one deficit. Like most track pads you can quickly double-click on something to grab and hold something such as moving a window around or to grab the scroll bar for small movements. The problem is that sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I'm pretty sure it's a hardware issue since I uninstalled the ALPS driver and loaded in the Synaptic's driver and it still had the same issue.A minor issue I've solved with a small cloth is the front LED lights.

After a few months the computer the audio jack port literally fell out of the side and Acer refused to pay for it's replacement, so I've not been able to use headphones for the past year. Now about 13 months after purchase, my motherboard has just gone. I called ACer and they refuse to cover the repair because it's a month past the warranty date. They are incredibly inflexible about this and it feels almost like a scam for it to breakdown so soon after the warranty cover the repairs.I get that the original issue was due to a fall but honestly it was not that bad (I've had a lot of other laptops Dell, Apple, and Sony- which have fallen a bit and been fine) but still it took 5 attempts to fix the screen after I paid for its replacement.
