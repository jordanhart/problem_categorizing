It feels drastically underpowered, as task manager shows that the CPU is maxed out when loading Firefox.

The Acer exceds my expectations! I love everything about this laptop! In my opinion, it performs better than the previous 2 brand name computers that I had. The 19' laptop was heavy, slow, big & clunky! The 15.6\" screen size is perfect & it's light enough to bring to all the wi-fi hot spots. It is very fast and doesn't drop the connection. I will purchase an Acer in the future.", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$414.99", "Features": "Large 3GB memory lets you run demanding programs. 250GB hard drive holds thousands of songs, photos and documents.\nWireless-N for high-performance, cable-free networking. 802.11b/g networks.
