{"Reviews": [{"Title": "AMAZING Laptop for the money!", "Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "R3JP9FIZ1UNO4O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been looking for a new laptop for some time now.  Trying to find a computer that is well-built, has great battery life, plenty of RAM and memory, and is a good price is a pretty tall order.  I've looked at all brands, ASUS, HP, Sony, Lenovo, Dell, even Mac.  Macs were too expensive, as were the Sony models that I looked at.  It came down to a decision between ASUS and this Samsung.  However, with the metal construction, and very well put together body, this feels very solid.Battery life has been outstanding!  6 hours+ with the screen on full brightness.  Graphics look great, videos are smooth with no lag or problems.  DVD drive is very quiet, and boots up quickly.  Very speedy processor, plenty of RAM...TONS of hard drive space.  This computer has been flawless.  I have a Samsung phone, and several other Samsung products, but this is the first Samsung computer that I've owned.  I'm very pleased with it!", "Date": "October 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good product, Bad service", "Author": "Shine", "ReviewID": "R231FZV1ZYZMDI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Well, I did not bought it from here but it does not matter. The computer has been great before I found out (after the return policy period) that the battery is faulty -- it only last for 8 minutes after I unplugged the power cord. The reading dropped from like 78% directly to 8% without intermediate values. I sent it to Samsung for repair, and they seem to repaired the battery to an OK status (last for like 2-3 hours), but brought new problems -- the LED lights (wifi, hdd and Numlock indicators) stopped working. I complained and sent it back to repair again, they claimed nothing is wrong and sent it back \"directly\", but I found out that the LEDs started to work properly, but the battery is now completely dead, even worse than the first time -- it won't charge at all. I completely stuck to my desk with a laptop that is without any mobility. I tried to get a replacement from Samsung and they wouldn't let me, claimed that sending it back to repair again was the only thing they can do. Frustrated.So if you bought a defective Samsung product, don't bother to repair, just return it or have an exchange from the dealer.", "Date": "October 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great value", "Author": "David Hakan", "ReviewID": "R2EW2N3K49J05A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very good computer especially at the $628 price. A Mac with comparable attributes would cost 4 times. 9 hr battery is a real plus.

It was posted that this item was used and that there may be scuffs. I haven't found any, not so much as a fingerprint when I got it. It runs really well and is true to description. Battery lasts quite a while (2 full length movies) or all day at work (on and off).

It was only $549, about $700 after taxes and an extended warranty.  The performance is great, no waiting times upon boot.  I go to LSU and must constantly deal with 400 person classes, all of which have little no no power sources; i have never had my computer die in class and i only charge it about twice a week.  Although people complain about the keyboard not being backlit and the touch pad being shaky, i haven't noticed any negatives to either.  As a student, this pc does everything i need it to do and more.  The speakers aren't bad, not the best, but not bad.As a student on a budget, this computer is the best choice.  For a Mac with the same specs, you would be paying over two thousand dollars, 800 extra alone for the hard drive.  Any problems i have had with the machine has been user error.  9 hours of battery!!!", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's Ok In A Pinch", "Author": "phantomwriter", "ReviewID": "R32H1QJU1P5KL3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought this computer new, its ok.Too many things about this laptop I'm not crazy about like wacky  touch pad, no lit keyboard, lousy speakers, hidden usb ports, etc.But I'll admit, it did the job and has Windows 7.", "Date": "September 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "AWESOME LAPTOP!!!!", "Author": "JC", "ReviewID": "R3JHD69FIGXEA8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this laptop for half the original price and im so Happy I did!!!!

The screen resolution will suddenly zoom, or will fly to another webpage I didn't want. It is so freakin' sensitive it is work to use the computer. I will sell this one.

I would have preferred a different trackpad layout, one with dedicated buttons rather than one huge trackpad with lines to specify where the left and right click is. choppy gameplay when running \"slender\" at average graphics, perfectly playable lower than that. can run \"Battle for middle earth 2\" flawlessly at ultra high graphics. can run \"minecraft\" at acceptable framerates at decent settings. not a hardcore gaming computer but will definitely stand up to casual gaming and other programs. I'm having a hard time making the processor use more than half of its potential power! usually uses about 1000mh of its 2500mh speed when running a couple of programs at once. I would recommend this product to anyone!--UPDATE--5 to 4 stars. I returned to bestbuy because I felt I overpaid for it. Its very durable, has a large hard drive, and has a long battery life, but thats about it. I settled for a sony vaio e series sve15115fxs because I felt it was a better buy (intel 3rd gen 3210m processor, intel graphics 4000 (as oposed to 3000 here, the 4000 is much faster) and the ability to connect to my ps3)", "Date": "August 19, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B007BFOP0I"}}
