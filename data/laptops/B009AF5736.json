I had to wait for a month directly from Toshiba! I opened it, the display was cracked ( the liquid was visible and going around and behind the screen,)Then I sent it back another month passed by... they sent me a supposedly a new one! In two weeks, my keyboard keys mulfunctioned, this time! I sent it back, ( By the way, every time you send it back, you have to pay shipping!) No mercy, from Toshiba on that!! Even you have a guareentee! Second time when I received the laptop back, I got all numbers of keyboard mulfunctioned again! So, I send it back, paid the shipping..3 rd time!!! Now, hardware failure message is coming up on the screen! So, I am tired of this and I really wanted to get Asus or Samsung to begin with! Since Toshiba has a great and reliable name I decided to order it, from Toshiba.Please and please buy any other brand but Toshiba!! You will be better off!!!", "Date": "July 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "okay...", "Author": "cute!", "ReviewID": "R27NHEO3XS1HL9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "computer's ok so far... the first time i bought it, it shut downed on me. so i called toshiba and they helped A LOT. got a new one. it's running good so far... windows 8 takes a little long to adjust to. the touchpad is a little annoying to use. its a the texture of it is rough and everytime i swipe it, the start(dont know whats its called) always pops out on the side which gets really annoying... overall good laptop. runs good. when watching on yt, it lags a llittle bit on some HD videos. keyboard is nice. not that heavy. it's actually lighter than a mac. camera sucks ass tho lol. an ipod touch camera quality is better! cant even skype with this thing.", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worst laptop I have ever had", "Author": "denalilady", "ReviewID": "RQSPC8I1NW12L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The laptop froze the first time I used it.

served to first determine if you're more of an \"appliance user\" interested just in reading email and browsing or if you're someone that wanted an underpriced briefcase sized battlestar.This thing should cost more, competing systems are more expensive because they don't manufacture and integrate their own LCD's and hard drives the way Toshiba does.BEFORE I start to complain, I want to sing this bastards accolades and I'm going to be just as blunt and profane with my praise.  When you jack this thing up to the max amphetamine amount of 16GB RAM, you become the owner of a Battlestar, with a lotta firepower and a big wideflight deck.  Do something else equally as sane as installing Windows 2008R2 HPC server or 2012 Server and you'll realize the full power of this gunship.Since I'm mean and cruel, I removed the 5,400 RPM hard drive and jammed thew oldest Toshiba SATA drive I could find after being excavated from a 2006 ThinkPad.-Installed 2012 Server/DataCenter Microsoft Windows Server Data Center 2012 64-Bit (Base License), (it intalled REEEAAALLY FAST). It installs nicely, you don't need a 16way server to run DataCenter.-Simultaneously fired up 6 Windows 32bit / 64bit Virtual machines (screenprint being uploaded) of --Windows7 32 bit that tastes like battery acid, but as Jonah says, just for colorAlien Resurrection - Movie Poster (Size: 27\" x 39\") --Two 64bit Linux Mint's --2008 Server DataCenter (\"r1\") 64bit --A 64bit BackTrack box, who cares which version since any version is just a tamed shark ready for war. --Macbuntu because once in a while using a Mac feels as satisfying as high qual medical marijuana --A 2012 ServerAnd despite throwing so many VM's at it, it still failed to crash, so just to ensure it would die, loaded up a few ( I lost count) a few versions of VistaVomit 32bit to really choke this thing down with the taste of nasty man juice.None of the VM's crashed, the host obviously stayed afloat, and pissed off but up and without errors.I failed to crash it, I could only slow it down, and probably just did more to annoy it the way a cut snake gets crawling in the moonlight. Next, I encumbered this mudda with a 133x Transcend CF card in a SATA adapter as the hard drive and replicated a bare version of the HPC server shoehorned onto a seven year near end of life CF card with more burnt out memory cells than IgnetowskiThe integrated track pad IS ATROCIOUS AS AN UNSCHEDULED FACE STABBINGEspecially with a wide screen Toshiba, the mouse is configured at default speeds requiring the owner to frequently pick up their finger and place back down to travel from one side of the screen to the other.  If the trackpad is left in factory state, that pick and lift is interpreted by Windows8 and any other version of Windows as a \"tap\" and that is left click so you end up selecting something instead of getting the cursor to where you wanted.It is worse in the drier winter air and trackpads are less effective with age from the patina of perspiration. Further more, the typical pH balance of younger people is better suited for trackpads and is why you might be feeling emasculated and old when your adolescent daughter seemingly uses the trackpad with ease while it goes crazy whenever you're trying it.It is possible to get control of the damn thing (uploading pics) and in the meantime, and I equally despise using written instructions to configure graphical computer menus, open your Mouse in the Windows Control Panel and then the Synaptics tab and at least turn off Tapping unless you really rely on Tap and review / disable the other features that have been annoying the creepudy crip cripe out of you.When calling Toshiba Technical Support, you're expected to provide system information to the telephone support rep, this is reasonable and customary with any computer HOWEVER Toshiba didn't include the tool when you purchased it. The download site is a mystery to find it and the tech will email the download while unapologetically refusing to wait for you to download and install. Instead, you will be instructed to call back, wait on hold for 30 minutes again after you've installed the tool.Hopefully, you haven't stabbed the Toshiba LCD with the screwdriver or cell phone you were holding in your hand when told to piss off and call back. Toshiba is quietly hoping you destroy the laptop in frustration for the evident profit benefits.I wish I was exaggerating about that, but verify for yourself you have to download a 100+MB windows utility to configure an embedded BIOS. Find out for yourself and realize what you've just read wasn't so ridiculous.The appalling part is the same utility applies to 4,200 Toshiba computers, their entire family tree of systems and based on their own numbers of the \"Applicable Models\" list pasted into a comma counting editor.For one file, one single and same utility that is relevant across so my different of their computers... WHY THE HELL DON'T THEY MAKE THE FILE EASIER TO FINDWHY THE GUFF DON'T THEY PIN THE UTILITY, AN ARTICLE, SOMETHING ?But, I did get to post on their forum and my heels immediately nipped at by their little disciples and stupid users who insisted it was my fault, these people accused me of having an \"agenda\",  they insisted Toshiba's are perfect.They all have battered spouse syndrome if they believe it is acceptable to be abused by your laptop maker.I'm pasting the download link and page to the utility into the comments appending this reviewAmazon paternally strips links out of reviews, but allows them in comments, even links to competitors listings.", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B009AF5736"}}
