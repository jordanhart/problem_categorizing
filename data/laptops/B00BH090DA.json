This VAIO hit the mark.  It has a fast processor, fast RAM, and a semi-fast hard drive.  Out of the box, booted up in about 15 seconds (after the initial setup).Now day 1 after getting it set up and configured the way I like, I replaced the hard drive with a solid state drive - Kingston's 120GB HyperX drive - extremely fast.  I cloned the hard drive to the SSD, and was able to boot up in less than 7 seconds with Windows 8 - just what I was hoping for.All and all, this laptop is a must have if you are looking for fast, and touchsreen.  Yes, it does pick up fingerprints, but I put a screen protector on it, and it reduced the glare, and keeps away those prints.  So don't let the other reviewers steer you wrong, as this is a sure fire speed deamon, especially if you plan on installing a SSD.Thumbs up from the PC Whiz!", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Warning Sony some horrible design features a NO REPEAT NO Sony backup. Best Buy is just as bad.", "Author": "harold thomas", "ReviewID": "R2IP6YPU0A5PWQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've waited 11 months to write this review. In general this little laptop is useful and nice looking. Having 4 USB ports, an optical drive, touch screen, HDMI, and serial port is wonderful too. OK now, the hard drive began to fail in less than a month and was fixed under warranty. The screen side of the device (top) is connected with two plastic hinges both of which have failed. Best Buy tells me that even though the unit is under warranty the hinges are not covered. Sony customer support now tells me the same. Fortunately I work on these things for a living and I was able to fix the hinge connections myself. But if you're not hip to disassembling these things it's going to be a miserable experience dealing with Best Buy or Sony support. There are other touch screen laptops out there that are better built  for less money. I'm thinking Sony might have rushed the intro date on this thing and put out a less than sparking  \"SONY\" product. This has to be a DO NOT BUY recommendation", "Date": "February 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "This is a great machine, why so low rating?", "Author": "Ross", "ReviewID": "R1YAYIHL0FO3F1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like this machine. I was in the market for a new laptop for some time an decided a touchscreen would best serve my purpose. I'm an artist so working with the touch is a dream come true.I wasn't sure about windows 8 when it came out but after playing with it for a while decided it was in fact a good OS. Just different. I can see where it isn't optimal for a business but it suites my needs.But don't let windows 8 turn you away from a good quality computer. There is a program that will allow you to use Windows 8 like Windows 7, Vista, XP, or even 98! And it's free to boot! Just look up in any search engine Classic Shell and you'll find it.

First off, the touch pad may have been in-fact bad; however, it may just need updated drivers.  Those that complained about smudging and the reflective screen need an education in shopping 101.  Know what you are buying folks and know what issues you may face using common sense.  A screen you touch is going to pick up smudging.  The great thing about third party vendors is that you can pick up a matte screen protector that will reduce glare and help with not picking up finger prints.  I bought this computer refurbished and have only one problem with it so far which is no fault of Sony's.  Updating to Win 8.1 free through the Win Store screws the consumer as the update deletes Win 8 files that are useful when needing to recover your computer should it fail; thanks Microcrap.  They basically force you to buy 8.1 in order for everything to work as it should.  I could go on all day about the shadiness of 8.1 and the designers but I won't.  Anyway, the laptop is a step up from my last one from 2008; a core duo 14\" HP 2736us loaded with Vista.  That laptop however had the now-rare lightscribe drive...I never had a chance to use it; but having the option was nice.  That computer overheated; sound card failed along with the cd/dvd drive, and finally died after a while.  I shopped around for a bit and came across a refurbished Sony Vaio SVE14A35CXH.  It arrived with an overly scratched lid; however, the rest of the laptop looked new; original stickers present.  I could place a sticker made for laptops over the lid and the marks will never be seen again; no big deal.  This puppy has 4 usb ports; 2 2.0 and 2 3.0 with the option to charge devices while the computer is off.  The touch screen responsiveness is speedy but the Win8 gestures using the touchpad have yet to be perfected; it's easier to use the touch screen.  The laptop supports Bluetooth and has a backlit keyboard; which is great.  I also like the battery options available which help the battery to have a longer life-span.  At this point, I'd recommend.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "IT'S GOOD", "Author": "Haotian Chen", "ReviewID": "R3P864FX32HNK8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I LIKE IT,AND IT'S MEET MY EXPECTATION .SONY IS MY FAVORITE BRANDI LIKE ITI LIKE ITI LIKE IT", "Date": "August 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "A little problem", "Author": "Laura", "ReviewID": "RCRE97C6M85BF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "loved the computer and its functionality, but it came with a little problem on the screen and was difficult to reach a solution with the seller and with the sony.", "Date": "August 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worst PC I Have Ever Owned", "Author": "TheoCoog \"Theo\"", "ReviewID": "RSF12Y6J15T9Z", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The good parts first: It is nice looking when it is off. It is easy to set up, the sound quality is good, the documentation is good. In the dark, the display is excellent.Now the bad part: the screen is so incredibly shiny that it is very difficult to use because of all the glare. Even room light cause reflections and glare, so it works best in the dark. It is difficult to use in a lighted room and unusable outside.The Touch Pad is incredible sensitive and I find that I need an external mouse to do useful work.Save the aggravation and buy a PC with a matte finish screen.EDIT: One year later and I haven't smashed this POS to pieces with a hammer. But I have been tempted on many occasions. Over time it has gotten slower and slower and slower. I keep it clean using CCleaner, I have trimmed down all the startup apps using Microsoft's Autoruns, it is free from spyware, malware and viruses, I have uninstalled device drivers that are unused, and I have removed ALL the Sony bloatware and demos that it came loaded with. That alone freed up almost 90 GB!!! I have formatted the hard drive and started from scratch with a fresh install of the operating system and all the drivers. It is still slow. For example, switching from the desktop to the start screen is a timed 5 second task. Switching users (there are 3, with minimal profiles) takes 30-45 seconds. Loading Word 2013 from the desktop - 20 seconds, from the start screen - almost a minute.Installing the Windows 8.1 Update 1 was an all day deal that ultimately forced me to roll back all the previous Windows updates back to February. While this isn't Sony's fault, that fact that it took all day is partially due to the slow hard drive and processing speed of the laptop.I am convinced at this point that there is either a flaw in the BIOS, or a conflict with one of the Sony drivers for either the touchscreen, the Bluetooth radio, the hard drive, or the ridiculous Touch Pad. The disk drive is always in use and at least 25% of the CPU capacity is always being used by a process or service that I am unable to identify. I'm pretty good with PCs myself, and I've also had it looked at by Geek Squad, and two corporate PC techs doing me a favor and none of them can identify what is using the processor so much.I replaced this PC with an HP Elitebook a few months ago. The HP is twice as fast, half the cost, and came with far less bloatware. It is a little heavier than the VAIO. I have since given this VAIO to my 3rd grade kid who uses it to make pretty pictures with Paint and fools around with PowerPoint. She thinks it's great, but it's no good for serious business unless serious business for you means watching videos, listening to music, and drawing shapes in Paint. If I ever get bored, I'm going to try installing Ubuntu on it and see if that performs like a dog too.This is without a doubt, the very last Sony PC I will ever buy, and remains the worst PC I have ever owned. I would give it zero stars if I could.", "Date": "June 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Returned To Best Buy the next day", "Author": "Gabe Walker", "ReviewID": "RFNTL2BGF3DF7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "When I first unboxed and tinkered with this computer, I loved it. The touch screen seemed neat, Windows 8 seemed user friendly, and overall I was happy. After a few hours of playing with this computer, I was completely frustrated and dissatisfied with this piece of junk. The screen and casing of this laptop show fingerprints worse than any device I've ever used. The apps on Windows 8 were slow and had trouble opening even though I was on an extremely strong Wifi connection. Just do yourself a favor and buy and apple computer.
