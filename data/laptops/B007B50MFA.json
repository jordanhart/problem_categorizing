Why would acer continue to put out a product knowing it still has problems.  There support services said it is in the process of fixing it but doesn't have a timeframe,  but they will email me.  Not too impressed yet.", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Notebook", "Author": "Dionel Remedios", "ReviewID": "R2WGRCCXQIZ2M5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is a good laptop, we had ACERs from a lot of years and never a complain.
