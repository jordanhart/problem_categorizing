I do a lot of 3D modeling and this has made my life so much easier compared to my old machine.- Second headphone jack makes it perfect for watching DVDs with your buddy while you're stuck in Afghanistan- Windows 7 works like a champ and looks great- Facial recognition software (FastAccess) makes login fast, easy, somewhat fun (not sure if Amazon config has this). May not work if the room lighting is weird.- Attractive design, battery has fair life and doesn't stick out like the badonkadonk my wife's HP.- Laptop speakers that don't suck. Awesome. Also convenient, responsive media controls.- Quiet keyboard. Not sure if this config has the backlit version, but if so you are in for a treat. Very nifty and useful in low light.- Easy 1-door access panel on bottom for upgrade action- SD/Media Card reader to get your camera photos, etcCons:- Can get warm. Best used in combination with a Zalman ZM-NC2000 Notebook cooler. The cooler runs off USB (but you don't lose a port because it has some on it), keeps the laptop from getting warm, and fits perfectly. I suggest the black one.- Somewhat hefty. But hey, it's a \"desktop replacement\" size.- Only 3 USB ports- No number pad functionalityAll things considered I'm very pleased with my purchase and I can definitely recommend this model laptop for for someone who travels occasionally but not frequently.", "Date": "November 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great notebook for the price", "Author": "Nathan Beauchamp \"ConsumerAdvocate (nathan(at...", "ReviewID": "R241G72PTMH5U4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have a variation of the 1555 Studio configuration which consists of:1) P8700 Processor2) 4Gb Ram3) Full 1080x1920 screen4) 500gb 7200rpm hard drive5) ATI HD4670 1GB GPU6) BlueRay driveI bought it around Black Friday directly from Dell for just over a grand.Based on some of the comments/negative reviews of this computer, I'd like to say that I have owned and used Dell computers for over 10 years, and aside from one really crap Optiplex220 workstation, have had nothing but good experiences with them across a diverse range of computers including everything from a Dell Mini 10 to a couple XPS gaming machines (before I got wise and started building my own gaming computers about 5 years ago). As a brand, Dell is frequently maligned for being either cheaply made or offering poor service. I can say that in my experience, neither is true. (And to put that in context I work in a an office with about 8 dell workstations that I am responsible for maintaining, in addition to the Dells I've owned personally). I've gotten great service from them including an overnight battery replacement (under warranty) when it really counted. So, while I recognize that any company as large as Dell is going to have some misses, my personal experience has been excellent.I'd also like to say that I own 5 computers (counting my wife's) including an HP, a custom built gaming computer, and even an Apple. I work with a whole host of computers on a daily basis (Macs included) and am not a fanboy of any brand or manufacturer, nor do I engage in the stupid PC vs. Mac debates. I love technology in general, and will go wherever I can get the features I want for the best price to enable me to finish the task at hand. I bought this Studio 1555 to replace my workstation since I wanted to be able to work remotely more easily.Now on to my actual review:First off, there is one thing I really dislike about this notebook and that is the keyboard (which I'm using to type this review). It's not a tactile thing, or responsiveness, my typical complaint against keyboards in general. The keyboard squeaks. Not all the time and not loudly, but certain keys on the right side, including the backspace key, make a slight chirping sound that I find very irritating.What I love about the notebook far eclipses that one irritation, and the screen alone more than makes up for it. As one of the very, very few 15\" notebooks that offers full 1080x1920 resolution, it is also one of the cheapest. If you're going to buy just ONE upgrade for this notebook, make it that one. Having that much real estate on such a beautiful screen is worth every penny. SONY is the only other computer maker I could find with 15\" notebooks with full 1080p resolution, and they are on average $500 more than this dell. You could argue they are better (less weight, possibly more stylish, etc.) but the bottom line is that the Studio 1555 with a 1080p screen for around a grand is a GREAT deal. Especially considering the screen is beautiful.The feature set on the Studio 1555 series is also quite good with the newer, faster P series processors leading the way. With their architecture they also use less power, which means a P series notebook will run longer than an identical T series notebook, all things being equal. Windows 7 64-bit being standard is awesome, and once coupled with 4gb (or even 8gb if you want to pay through the nose) of ram, make this a very speedy machine. Boot times are great, and I can easily multitask with several demanding applications with no slowdown.Aesthetically, the notebook is good, but not fantastic. I elected to get the 'chainlink black' version since I use this notebook for work and didn't need a fancy lid. The layout is functional and logical without being superior (this is where SONY excels--they're probably the only company with a sense of style that rivals Apple). The port configuration is great, with everything you'd expect (HDMI, 3-USB, Esata, SD card reader, VGA) and then a few bonuses (FireWire800, and TWO headphone jacks--fantastic for sharing a BlueRay with someone on a flight, etc...)The Build quality is average to good. The aforementioned keyboard squeak lowers this category significantly, as does the heat build up on the panel below the keyboard which makes my wrists sweat a little bit. Thankfully Dell did make some solid improvements, including a really good hing for the screen which is heavy duty enough to make me believe the screen will open&close; without losing any firmness for years. The charger is adequate, but with a strange layout that defies logic--the power cord (the end that plugs into the wall) is very short at about 3-feet. The single power cable that runs to the ntoebook itself is fairly long, but I'd really like to see dell make a power adapter more like HPs with a nice long cable on both ends (from the wall to the adapter and then from the adapter to the notebook).Battery life is fantastic and better than I expected. Even when taxing the n-band wireless while streaming videos or downloading files (which uses a lot of power) I can still get 3.5-4hrs out of the notebook. If all I'm doing is word processing, e-mailing, and other light tasks, I can get upwards of 5 hours. If you set your power profile to the minimum, it is possible to get Dell's claimed 7 hours, but you'll have to live with a very dim monitor and no wifi usage to achieve those numbers--not many real world applications where that would work.PROs:1) Excellent and truly top-notch screen (1920x1080 HIGHLY recommended)2) Great feature set for the price, especially with a few well chosen upgrades3) Functional design that while not convincingly beautiful, is very well suited to getting work done.4) Quality components for the price5) Very solid battery lifeCONs:1) Squeaky keyboard2) Strange, less than stellar power adapterFINAL THOUGHTS:I bought this notebook to replace my workstation in my office. It's more than exceeded my expectations overall. With a better keyboard I'd happily give it 5 stars, but that one element is distracting enough to downgrade the Studio 1555 to 4 stars. If you want a very strong feature set for the price, you have to at least consider the Studio 1555 series from Dell. Check out the comments section of this review for some thoughts on configuration/prices if buying from Dell.4/5 Stars.

I wanted to get a laptop for school, and shopped around a little bit, I almost got a dell insperon, but Dell was having a sale, and this computer was $100.00 off! So I bought it, and I love it.The 15.6 inch screen is really nice, you can see a lot, and 720p resolution is actually really good looking on this laptop. I like the glossy screen, but if you are sitting next to a window there might be too much glare.The HDMI output is a very nice feature because you can hook your computer to your TV and watch movies, or play games.I dont know if the one on amazon has the included backlit keyboard, but it is a very nice feature. The keys are very hard to see in the dark without it.It is really fast with 4 gigs of ram, it can convert movies to another format in an hour with the 2.2GHz  dual core processor.This laptop gets warm when you use it, but I have never had it get too hot. It has good battery life. I have gotten 5 and a half hours out of it just surfing the web, and I have watched 2 movies back to back on an airplane, the movies were not dvds (I copied the dvds to my computer beforehand because the optical drive takes a lot of power).Overall I would recommend this laptop.

They are making computers thinner and lighter which ends up restricting the airflow. This causes internal parts to overheat. The typical result in my computer is that the graphics card will overheat and cause the system to lock up.I have this Dell Studio 15\" with factory upgraded ram and other goodies totaling about $1000 investment. Since the new box arrived at my door a year ago, it has continually crashed and locked-up. Dell support has tried everything under the sun, short of giving me a new computer. This includes sending techs to my house and replacing internal parts like the graphics card, motherboard, etc. Alas, nothing changes. The fan always runs at full throttle within moments of start-up. If I try to watch a video or even if a web-page has anything using flash, immediately graphics card failure occurs resulting an over-sized cursor and a total system lock-up. My only option is to do a hard system shutdown. Disabling flash or other scripts only delays the inevitable.I have owned several Dells in the past and WAS a huge fan of Dell; however, this experience has left me very frustrated and disappointed. One tech advised me to purchase a Toshiba as they are not having this issue because their laptops are still a little bulkier providing better airflow.", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great

I think this a great lap top and it gets the job done. I kept reading all the negative reviews and i have no idea why there's so much bad press. I have never once called customer service and i ordered my laptop at Dell directly through their website. I have no reason to contact customer service and i never experienced any problems at all with any of my Dell products. I get so baffled when i read all these negative reviews. My Dell products which i have had for years including a Dell desktop and a recently purchased new netbooks have never been a problem. The desk top i have is more than 6 years old and I never have any problems. It runs great. It can definitely benefit from an upgrade in some areas.The Studio line is Dell's midrange laptops. The Inspiron being there low end range for consumers that just need a standard laptop. The Dell Studio laptop is completely plastic and it's a bit on the heavy side in my opinion. Maybe because i am so use to my light weight Dell 10 min netbook that i have been spoiled. This is a good lap top. However, i think the flaw in Dell is that their products can get very pricey very quickly. Especially when you are adding in high end features like 6GB RAM rather than 3GB RAM or 2.99GHZ instead of 2.33GHZ etc. You can get the same thing at HP for probably around a hundred dollars less and their quality feels a bit more refined, polished, and sturdy. That being said if you check Dell's website they do have deals going on all the time especially on holidays. But for some reason the price never seems as low as it should be. If you check periodically you will find yourself a deal. I go to that website religiously and build the exact same laptop that I have and it always comes up to more money. I got mine on a special promo.I really regret getting the green covered case. I didn't realize how bright it would be and once i opened it out of the box - I really wish i purchased the Dark Blue or Dark Purple colored case. It's really way too bright. I like the personalization options of the different colors, but i really do regret getting this bright Caribbean green color. My laptop also includes the backlit keyboard which is great for typing in the dark. It also has touch sensitive controls towards the top of the keyboard near the speakers and i think that's a great plus. The DVD is also an optical drive, so there is no door that slides out for you to pop in your DVD. It's like a Playstation 3 slot. You slide the DVDs in & out.Pros:15 inch screenOptical DVD slot4GB RAM750 GB Memory2.66GHZBacklit keyboard4 UBS slotsHDMI outportSleak shiek designDifferent colored casesWi-FiWebcamCons:Windows Vista (Super Whack)A bit pricey in my opinion (That's Dell for you)A bit on the heavy side", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Durable and satisfactory", "Author": "csi_speedchick", "ReviewID": "R36QHLDEHW55N5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my Dell Studio 1555 since September 2009. I've used it to play games, do college work, and other minor things. Anytime I have had an issue with something on the laptop the Dell support has been readily available to help me out and solve the problem quickly.I've seen a lot of reviews on here that say that this laptop overheats easily. I find this FALSE. (caps used for emphasis) Mine has never crashed because of becoming too hot, but it has become hot enough that the bottom was uncomfortable to touch.I have also read many reviews saying it has a terrible battery life. Mine is 3 years old and by setting it on \"Power Saver\" form the Power Options window, I get about 4-5 hours of battery life.For those of you who don't know or are curious, if you look in the bottom right corner of the screen there should be a battery icon that you can right-click on and select \"Power Options\" which will open a window that you can choose one of three different ways for your battery to use its juice. There's one that devotes most of the juice to high performance, but this drains the battery quickly. There's another that saves power (which is what I use), but says that it doesn't give very good performance - for doing college work, surfing the internet, playing games, and streaming videos/movies I find the level of performance to be very adequate for this option. The third level is a balance between the two...well, it says balance, but it devotes slightly more juice to performance than battery life (it's like a \"55-45\" ratio.)Now, here are the things I find unfortunate about this laptop...1. No number pad - this isn't awful, just inconvenient.2. No indication of whether or not Caps Lock is on unless you're on the log in screen. - Slightly annoying, but it's not too hard to type a letter and see the result.3. The grips on the bottom of the laptop come off easily if you slide your computer around on your desk. I lost all of mine over the course of the 3 years I've owned it, but unless you're always working on a slanted surface you really don't need them.Overall, I think this is a nice computer to have despite other reviews.

One of the first things I noticed about this laptop was how good it looks. I love the feel of the keyboard, and the trackpad works very well. The speakers are surprisingly good for stock computer speakers, and the ports on the sides of the laptop are well placed.All else aside, this computer has aged beautifully.

Well the graphics was really another company's headache but, few laptops provided that kind of customization, Dell being one of the few.Being the emerging choice selection of many of my friends and colleagues, I was intrigued by the Dell laptops. They provided three kinds of laptops depending on budget - Inspiron, Studio and XPS. Drooling all over the XPS just wouldn't bring the price into my budget, so I had to switch over to Studio. Inspiron just wouldn't handle my needs.With 250 GB DDR3 hard drive  and 4 GB RAM, the Studio 15 came with the customization option - everything from the aforementioned RAM (you could tone it down - let's face it, why would you), cover color, Graphics Card, Graphics Memory, Audio Card to name a few slots.Now the real headache was the Graphics card. Nvidia, the way it's meant to be played? Or ATI? (Intel was pretty much out). A lot of head-banging in front of the customization page later, I decided to go with ATI 4570 HD with 1 GB memory. My budget could buy me that.And voila, I had the makings of a laptop that was not too far ahead of its time, nor too far behind. My only gripe was that selecting a gloss-finish for the cover would have added a lot more to the total.Now the most important thing awaited: warranty. Being the most sacred document of understanding between the manufacturer and the customer, its absence would spell complete anarchy. My previous laptop met its maker so soon due to my lacklustre interest in the upkeep of its warranty - I was not going to let that happen another time.This could also be customized according to Dell - I went a little overboard and checked the 3 year limited warranty. Hey, better safe than blame someone else and better blame someone else than be sorry, huh?Yours is here. Yeah mine was here in a matter of 10 days, and boy did I love it. I played around with it like a 10 year old with his first Nintendo. My old laptop died a peaceful death as I revelled in my victory with modern technology. Games like Modern Warfare 2 and Assassin's Creed ran perfectly and movies with 1080p (which in 16:9 resolution is same as 720p only take more memory) ran with great aplomb. The screen was wide and so was my satisfaction.Intense competition was transcended by Dell with it myriad choice of products and customization options. I just wished everything else had as much customization possibilities as Dell provided me with. Good to know where the world is headed when it comes to non-Apple laptops.

My version has:CPU: P7450HDD: 500GBRAM: 4GBGraphics: ATI Radeon HD 4570Screen: 15.6USB: 2+1 eSata/USB combo.O/S: Windows 7 Professional 64-bit.I have had this laptop for most of a year now, and it has been a good work horse. I use it primarily for university work, and this has involved running AutoCAD, MatLab, ArcGIS, MS Office, Photoshop and, as I am a student, Oblivion GotY Edition, AoE2, Unreal Tournament, Trackmania, and GTA4.Useage-wise, it has excellent connection capibilities, though mineis without Bluetooth. I regularly use the HDMI out to connect to another screen, which makes doing research easier. The eSata port has not been used yet, though I am in the process of getting an HDD which will use it.There are twin headphone slots which you can customise for what they are being used for.The speakers are a little better than many laptops, but they are still quite tinny. With headphones, even cheap ones, the built in Audio Controls are excellent for setting up good sound.The Webcam is a little poor quality, but as an integrated unit, it is ok. The stereo microphones are very sensitive though.The trackpad is quite good, though I think the wifi card is below it, and it can get hot with heavy use.The DVD player is a slot loading device, and hasn't let me down yet. The annoying thing about its position is that it is directly above the single right hand USB port. If the device connected to the laptop has a large USB port connector, it blocks the DVD slot. Poor design choice there.The keyboard is ok, though I wish I had gone for the backlight keyboard.The media controls have taken over primary use from the function keys, which with prolonged use has shown to be a good idea, though a seperate set of buttons whould have been nice.Battery life is excellent. Even when running ArcGIS, modelling a geological map and a second screen with the internet running, I get a good 3-4 hours out of it a year down the line. With less intensive use and Dell extend battery life enabled, it has gone for 8 hours of light use. (like reading pdfs, and a little wireless internet use)The screen is good quality, though I find it attracts dust like nothing else. Maybe it is just that it is a fairly glossy screen, so I notice it more.The power adapter is very small, which is good. It does make some funny noises though, and it gets quite hot. Also the connection to the mains is u-shaped, so when useing the cable at maximum extent, it is smaller then the total length of cable.Performance wise, even with Windows eating a good Gig of RAM, it handles most applications quickly. I have had problems in the past with performance at the start up though - for a good 5mins after the task manager says the computer is running mostly in idle, I can take 10-15seconds to get Firefox loaded properly. Been told this is a Windows problem, and I need to format the computer. Also had problems with large MS Excel documents, though I think that is more to do with Excel being unwieldy with large amounts of data.But most of the time it runs fine. It runs Oblivion at max settings with only slight frame rate drop when there are lots of enemies on screen whilst passing into a new map area. Trackmania it runs at max, thouugh online play is limited by the host, so for that I use lower settings so not to overload other players. GTA it does struggle with. It does run it, but at medium settings at the most.At the higher performance setteings, it does get hot. The cooling fans suck air in from the bottom of the laptop on the left side. This is fine when at a desktop, but when sitting with it that happens to be where your leg is placed. The way the screen is hinged (A neat system which makes the laptop expand a bit) at maximum screen angles, the exhaust of the CPU can blow hot air up the screen. Neither are particuarly bad, but they just feel like its one of the few places where form fit over function. Long term, I hope it does not affect anything.The matt paint covering the top of the laptop is a good choice. I doesn't show fingerprints, and scratchs are hidden. Will be looking for matt coloured laptops from now on (though this one I got was red, and it does have a very pink look to it if the sun catches it wrong!)In the recent icy weather we got (Currently in Delft, Netherlands) I managed to fall of my bike a few times. One such fall the laptop got a good hit. The left hand screen join has had its cover cracked and ... thats about it. Runs fine, didn't need any help on start up, nothing. My previous laptop (also a Dell) died after a similar incident (in Scotland though). Toughness then I cannot fault.Overall, I have been very pleased with the quality and power of this system. It has not let me wrong yet, and with the eSata port/firewire and express card, it has good upgrade capibilites for the future.4/5 stars not 5 because of the problems with the fan placement, start up (though this is probably windows), power pack noises. All else is excellent. If you want a laptop which can replace a desktop and isn't too heavy and can handle pretty much everything thrown at it, get one of these. (Though try a newer one.
