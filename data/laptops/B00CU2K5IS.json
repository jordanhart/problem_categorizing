{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent for the price, but not for novices", "Author": "Sara", "ReviewID": "RGD40CWC20KR5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop because it was about the cheapest full-blown laptop I could find, and because its OS was listed as Linux. It's not as cheap as some of the Chromebooks, but you can install any OS you want on it, which was the main draw for me.It is supposed to come with Linpus Linux preinstalled, which is a distribution based on Fedora, according to their website. However, whatever was on the hard drive was text-only, and root only. As far as I could tell there was no rpm command or yum command installed on the system. I couldn't even add a non-root user. I find it odd that Acer would sell a laptop in this state. It didn't really bother me because I was going to wipe it and install Linux Mint anyway, but this would be a very bad experience for a novice user. Perhaps it was a production hiccup or something. I don't know.It comes with an installation CD, which I assume can get you a working OS, but since the machine doesn't have a cdrom, unless you have an external USB CDROM or something, it's kind of useless.Once I got a working OS installed on it (using an installation image written to a USB thumb drive), though, the hardware really started to shine. Its processor is fast enough (dual core 1.5 GHz Intel), its video rendering far exceeded my expectations (it is able to drive its built-in screen as well as an external 1080p monitor at the same time without hiccups), and it's got a lot of memory for such a cheap machine (4GB). The battery life is good. I can get 4-5 hours of use between charges.The trackpad is also the mouse button (no separate mouse buttons), and it will detect a two finger press so you can right-click, scroll, etc., but that's something to get used to. It also has a webcam, but I have yet to use it, so I won't comment on it. One small annoyance is the spacebar; it's hard to get it to respond to being pressed.But all in all, it's been a good experience.PROs: price; unlocked bootloader and BIOS (with option to disable EUFI); acceptable sound; good screen; nice CPU performance; excellent video performance; good battery lifeCONS: linux experts only; no hard disk, caps lock, or num lock indicator LEDs (very strange); funky battery form factor (raises the laptop at least a half inch in the back when placed on a table)", "Date": "September 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dandy little laptop", "Author": "Professor", "ReviewID": "RPIW2J4TM9JRB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed a small portable laptop to take with me during travel.  I had originally purchased a Lenovo S400 but that was a nightmare and the original selling vendor took it back after it spent ten weeks in the Lenovo service depot where they broke more than they fixed.After reading the end user license agreement (EULA) for Windows 8, I decided that it was not acceptable.  A Mac airbook is great, but I just cannot afford that.  I did much reading and decided to buy this machine from Amazon.  It took about a week to get it, I think that it must be a special order item from Acer to Amazon.  At that time, the product listing said that it is sold and shipped from Amazon, but it will take an extra 1 to 2 days.The unit came and I tried it out.  The Keyboard is the right size and I can touch type on it just fine.  Smaller netbooks will not allow touch typing except for people with very small hands.  The screen is also of adequate size to use and is quite functional.The installed linux is not installed.  A loop device has been created and a stripped text mode only linux live disk was copied onto the hard drive.  This is the same as putting a live disk in CD drive, except that this machine has no CD drive.  This is a very nice small machine and is very portable.In other words, they wanted to put something of an OS on it to ship it, but they realize that Linux users each have their own favorite distribution.  I put Suse 12.3 on it and it took about 20 minutes.  Of course, I needed an external CD drive for this.  I spent about another 20 minutes putting in the applications and programs that I wanted and adjusting the settings for my preferences.The included CD that came with the machine is a batch of drivers for Windows, I do not know why they included it with this machine.The machine has 4 GB of RAM.  Some of it is shared with the graphics.  The installation did use all of the RAM.  But since installed, the system monitor shows that it rarely goes over 2 GB during use.  This is a machine for carrying with me.  When I want to do some heavy computing, I use a big machine.  I did not see an access panel for adding any more RAM, but it is supposed to have two sockets and allow a maximum of 8 GB.This unit has a large battery in it.  On the negative, it adds a little weight.  But not much.  On the positive side, it adds much usable time between recharges.  Another neat thing about it is that it is in the back bottom of the machine and lifts the back up, giving the machine just the right incline for touch typing (I am using it for this review) and it also allows for air flow under the machine.I have used this machine for about a week now and have found it very stable, very usable, and one of the best little laptops that I have ever seen or used.  It has full power, (unlike a netbook), it has a long battery life (will see, One has to charge it all the way up and then run it down to 20% several times to cycle it properly to give it good life), a normal size keyboard, a usable screen, and it works very well with Suse Linux, and in all, I am extremely pleased.I will have to say that someone who knows what they are doing will have to install the Linux, this is not for an amateur who does not read instructions.  Once it is installed, it is a great machine, and I recommend it to anyone.  It is Linux, not Windows, so if you are looking for Windows, then buy a machine with that on it.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Chromebook? Tablet? No way! Try this instead...IF you're familiar with Linux", "Author": "Evan Graham", "ReviewID": "R38YH98OL75VZ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For what it is, it's a 5 star product.  Not sure what you can expect at this price point, but I've been pleasantly surprised by this machine.  Here's a few notes about the product I received:Pro's- The unit comes with a 1.5 GHz dual-core Celeron - not a 1.1.- This machine will technically run Windows 7 (had issues with 8) but it's incredibly slow doing so, not to mention you will need to fetch drivers off the Interwebs.  Do a query for \"Aspire V5-133\" if you go to Acer's site.- Linux runs great!  Have tried Debian/Ubuntu 12.04 LTS/Linux Mint 15/LMDE and all install without a hitch.Cons- The mouse on this unit is next to terrible - get a USB mouse or face constant aggravation.- The screen quality is sub-par but what do you want at this price.- The machine is technically user serviceable but I didn't feel comfortable replacing the HD without potentially causing problems.  Pretty sure YouTube can help though.SummaryI'm pretty sure this is the cheapest laptop you can get to run full blown Linux rather than Chrome OS.  This was the draw for me.  If you don't run Linux, quite frankly, stay away from this laptop; it's just not equipped to handle mainstream applications and operating environments.  That said, if you don't want a tablet and know a little bit about Linux, I'd deem this an excellent value in this price range and beyond.Hope this helps.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice little linux laptop!", "Author": "rleggett", "ReviewID": "R28H0MD0X3BJM3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the price this is an excellent little linux laptop.  So far I've tried three different distributions on it, and haven't run into any trouble.  No, it's not a desktop replacement or \"ultrabook\", but neither is it a \"netbook\".  You won't be doing scientific number crunching or graphical games, but it's small, lightweight, has an 8+ hour battery time, if you know linux you will have no trouble with it all.  Doesn't have bluetooth, but oh well.  Overall I'm very very happy, and it even arrived at my door only one day after I ordered.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "A True Road Warrier, though Flawed", "Author": "Peter Besenbruch", "ReviewID": "RGZAT97XRVN4C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased the Acer to replace a similar Asus model, the X201 series. There were many things I liked about the Asus, but I found I could use more battery life, and the glossy screen could be annoying. In general, the Acer V5 is a better machine for taking on the road, as it has roughly double the battery life of the Asus X201, and the Acer's matte screen remains wonderfully reflection free.That said, the Acer doesn't have all the advantages. First, what you get is a computer that boots to a crippled Linpus Linux loopback install. You can't do anything with it. Acer provides a CD, but it contains user manuals that give meaningless advice on setting up your machine. Oh, and they provide Windows Vista drivers. Vista is a rather outdated, much maligned operating system that basically has faded away.Some of this laptop feels rather old from a hardware perspective, too. First, the three USB ports are all version 2. The Asus managed one USB3 port, at least. Still \"old\" isn't always bad. The Acer has a RAM slot inside that allows upgrades to 8G. What you won't find inside is a battery. It hangs off the back, and sticks down quite a ways.The battery does two things. It angles the laptop's keyboard quite a bit. It also boosts the Acer's weight. That weight gives you a boost in battery life. Running the identical setup (Debian) on both the Acer and the Asus, I get 8 hours reported on the Acer, and 4 on the Asus. I could get close to the 4 hour figure on the Asus, and really looking forward to working with the Acer.Linux hardware compatibility is pretty good, as the Sandy Bridge chipset is well supported. Broadcom supplies a trouble free Gigabit Ethernet, and the Atheros wireless works well with Linux. I ran into one issue with Debian. The screen brightness keys would register on screen, but the screen would not change brightness. I fixed it by changing one line in the /etc/defaults/grub file to look like this:GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"acpi_osi='Linux'\"You then run update-grub as root, and reboot. It seems lots of Acer laptops suffer from this issue.Connectivity, like the Asus, is exemplary. Three USB ports, a deep SD card slot, Ethernet, and two video outputs (VGA and HDMI) round out the package.Final words about the keyboard and touchpad. The keyboard is decent. I like the separate page-up and down keys. I don't like that these keys are part of a complex of tiny keys that include arrows, and a host of function keys. It's all a bit hard to get used to.Other reviewers have panned the touchpad. I won't. While smaller than the Asus pad, the Acer's Elantech pad responds well to taps and swipes. Linux users would do well to get acquainted with Synclient, a typically Linux solution to many touchpad issues. It involves command line techniques, editing text files and creating scripts. It's also the most powerful touchpad adjustment program out there. With it I set up two fingered vertical scrolling, one fingered bottom edge horizontal scrolling, and two and three fingered tapping.Should you get the Acer? Sure, if computers don't scare you. While computers from Asus come with a working system installed, the Acer is a better road machine. You may also want to try out some Haswell chipset machines. These chips squeeze about 50% more life from a given battery. As of this writing, the only Haswell based laptops I have seen in this form factor are Chromebooks, and they have their own issues.Update 21 May, 2014: I have run into continual problems with the SD card slot. This has been pretty consistent over a wide range of kernels and cards. Slow cards (class 4) only mount if you boot the machine with the card inserted. If you pull the card, and want to re-insert it, you have to reboot the system with the card installed.Faster cards (classes 6, 10, and above) don't work period. They may be recognized, but are not read.I have tried various Linux kernels from 3.2 to 3.14. I have also tried drivers from Debian's repository and Broadcom's Web site. As far as I can make out, Broadcom's Linux support is either lacking, or the reader itself is. Either way, I am reducing the rating of the laptop by one star.The work around involves the purchase of an SD card to USB adapter.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good deal", "Author": "Leo", "ReviewID": "R1OIXV09T8OV54", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The laptop is very light in weight, super quiet, graphic/resolution is good.

So it arrived a week late.More CONSI was surprised at how small the screen was, how tiny the laptop was and at how the manufacturer cut costs at every possible opportunityAnd more CONS1) This was pre-installed with some funky version of Linux, without a GUI and limited command-line capability. No idea why the manufacturer did not simply pre-install a full-featured Linux (which users could subsequently wipe off if desired).2) I had a bit of a tough time installing Ubuntu (14.04 LTS) on the machine, had to mount the USB drive at boot time, after that the original disk system got corrupted, had to create a recovery disk, took nearly 2 hours mucking through it.(As others commented, a novice would find it pretty challenging)PROS1) Once installed, Linux runs very smoothly. 4 GB is awesome for such a cheap machine, I can install Eclipse and set up a dev server instance without hogging everything2) The monitor resolution is surprisingly good. And one can always drive an external monitor3) The laptop feels far more expensive than the sum of its parts, it is very handy to carry aroundCONCLUSIONIt would be very difficult to find a better Linux laptop at this price.I just wish the manufacturer pre-installed a full-fledged version of some mainstream Linux on it.
