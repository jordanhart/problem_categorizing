When shutting down it'll sometimes hang there in shutdown mode (for a half-hour or so) until the processor decides to send it into some sort of fault mode. Booting-up, where it used to go like lightning, now sees the device warming up to where it takes 10 minutes to get to the Windows login screen. Can't think of anything I did to it to make it turn on me. The kicker's that I bought two (one for my fiancee) and I'm fearful of letting her crack hers open until I care enough to get the bugs worked-out of my device. I sometimes think that this machine, for as advanced as it is, holds me in contempt, having achieved some level of sentience, for not being up to its thoroughbred pedigree.When it does perform, it goes like the wind!", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Toshiba Satellite S50-ABT2N22 15.6\" Quad Edition Windows 7 PRO Notebook PC", "Author": "Aruban", "ReviewID": "R1YVZQ8RNU7M8Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Not as fast as I expected since it has 16 GB of RAM and 8 processors.  No problems yet with the 1 TB storage.  Hope it stays that way.  I wish the display had better resolution than 1366x768.

I have not used it long enough to REALLY feel inner power or its capabilities, but all indications are positive. My only \"gripe\", if you will, I truly believe it is a bit overpriced.

The reason I regret this purchase is that if you are not careful how you pick it up when it is on, the screen will go to static and you have to reboot. Come on this is a laptop.
