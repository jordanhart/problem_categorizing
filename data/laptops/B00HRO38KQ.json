I have had to call on issues with installation of software (original to the computer) and issues with the touch screen.  My most recent contact was February 28, 2014.  The service tech went through the software and reinstalled drivers and the touch screen was back in business.  However the touch screen quit working about 6 hours later.

This is my third Dell and it is because of the horrid tech support at Dell that I considered something else.  It ran extremely slow and was mostly non-responsive. My IT person said it needed to catch up on updates. So I did all updates and after 2 weeks I get a blue screen saying it needed recovery repair.  I have been waiting for over a week to get a disc to do the repair.  They have sent it 3 times supposedly but still no disc.Maybe Amazon can give me a contact name in this country because I am dealing with India and they are useless!E", "Date": "April 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Deel Inspiron", "Author": "Beatriz Smdt", "ReviewID": "R3TXHD2AT3CJ8O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really liked the computador!
