{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great for college", "Author": "Coelispex", "ReviewID": "R233Q0MPFXWT4E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm giving this a 4 star for fulfilling it's purpose. I'm using this mainly to take notes in class and compile and program in Java; since I'm a CompSci major. It has met and exceeded it's main job. This machine is not meant to be your main computer or anywhere close to that - I have a more powerful gaming rig at home. This is just a college laptop.Pros:- 14\" Touchscreen.- Weighs at 3.8 pounds (I actually weighed this)- Dark chocolate matte finish for the outer coat; awesome silver finish inside.- Upgradeability: 1x 8GB DDR3 1600 MHz 204-Pin and/or 2.5 inch SSD for future-proofing- Beautiful keyboard, love typing on this thing :)- Slim design.- Quiet, silent cooling.Cons:- Terrible battery life (3 hours or less)- WiFi card cannot connect to 5GHz!- 0.3 WebcamAll of this for $409 (Purchased on 3/8/14) was worth my money. It all depends on how you use the laptop.Feel free to reply to this if you have any questions, I'm happy to answer them.", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Acceptable-built laptop for a novice user.", "Author": "Bostonian \"PDo\"", "ReviewID": "R1PDDD9YRRWKE8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop for my wife who has never used computer before.  I found that the touchscreen was helpful for her.  Perhaps the others would find Window 8 is unpleasant, but it is convenient for her.  No mouse is needed, but fingers to touch.  Touching and learning along the way is not bad for a person who didn't know anything about computer before.To me this laptop is acceptable-built for a computer beginner.  For the needs to surf the web, to check email, and to read news, doing some clerical works for a small business, this laptop works out alright.  Obviously, this laptop is not designed to do the work that would require a great deal of RAM or speed.  Particularly, it is certainly not used to deal with gaming or application of heavy load.  This is a basic laptop. Its original price of more $600.00 is wacky.  I don't expect there would be buyers for that price to get this laptop.  My purchase of this laptop is sold by the seller \"e-store buy\"  after discount.  Without a big discount I will not buy this laptop.Overall, this is an acceptable-built laptop for a novice user with the selling price after a big discount.", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Regards", "Author": "Edgar Longa", "ReviewID": "R280Y1OD9FR81C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent team, I taste in design, weight, how to get the keyboard is great, looks like a mac, the touch screen is easy to handle, I recommend this product 100% and the seller is a serious and responsible person, the delivery times were as expected, I'm very at ease.", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "It does quite well.", "Author": "D.

After updating all software and Windows 8.1, this laptop does the job well. The size is perfect, fits in my tote bag perfectly and it's so lightweight. Screen is bright and clear. Viewing angles are just OK which is fine cuz then it eliminates the need to get a privacy screen.

I had paid for the upgraded warranty, and they overnighted me a box to return it to their repair center.  I had asked for a local place in Houston to take it to and they directed me to a partner finding page on their website.  The customer care rep had no idea who to call.  After calling 3 different venders from the list and finding them all out of service, went with the overnight shipping back to the repair center.Received it back the following Friday with a note saying they replaced the motherboard and everything was tested and working correctly.  But, still did not work!  Called customer support; was advised they could ship me another box to have returned back to the repair center.  Asked to either have someone sent to the house to repair it, ship me a new computer, or refund my money.  Was put on hold so the guy could talk to his team leader.  After 15 min was sent back to the switchboard, transferred back and disconnected.  Called again, new rep was rude, could not find original info, and when asked for his name, hung up on me.  Called again, and finally got a team leader to call me back.  Said he could ask for  a one time exception to have someone come to the house, but it would have to be approved, and probably wouldn\u2019t be.  Same response for immediately shipping out a new computer, or refunding my money so I could purchase a better brand.  We need this computer for our business and this long delay is unacceptable.  So I told him to email me a shipping lable and I would immediately put it in the mail back to them, his response, we have to ship you a whole new box and label?????  I have the box I just received 2 hours ealier, just send me the label!The worst customer support I have ever received.  They should buy and apple product and call their support to learn how to operate.  I will be trying to get my money back to do just that!", "Date": "May 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "More trouble than it should have been.", "Author": "Raymond D.
