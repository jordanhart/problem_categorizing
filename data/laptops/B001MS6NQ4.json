Fast, stylish, the screen is crystal clear, the speaker sounds great.

It's very functional, comfortable and easy to type, and not too heavy.  (about 6 lbs.)  I can easily travel with it and it's very nice and modern looking! I got it for a great price too.

I use basically text programs, music score editing programs and listen to a lot of music, besides the average internet/email/home video and photos use. I don't watch movies or play games on the computer, so I don't know if it's recomended for this kind of use.

A screen flicker at the bottom of the screen started after 9 month's, it's a known issue Sony will fix but refuse too. I sent it in and they said it had water damage regardless of the fact that it's never touched water and the moisture sticker clearly shows no moisture has touched the laptop. I would just avoid Sony, not because they make horrible products but because they refuse to help there customers. Also after 10 month's the fan went off balance and began to buzz very loud, I had it replaced for 50 dollars by an IT Tech.", "Date": "July 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sticking with Sony from now on", "Author": "Mh", "ReviewID": "R2WTP9OJ7W70S1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first Vaio after experience with Dell, HP, and Compaq laptops. This one is by far my favorite and the best I have ever had. This laptop also comes with a quadcore processor making it extremely fast. I have had no problems with it. It is lightweight, compact, and good-looking. No regrets.

Let's just say in the span of the one-year limited warranty that I had my laptop serviced about 6 or 7 times. I literally lost count. The fan was replaced 3 times. The display was replaced once. And now? The display is all about flickering and rainbows. $500 to replace. I said no.

It is available directly from Sony at this address:[...]WITHOUT THIS UPDATE YOUR WIRELESS INTERNET WILL NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY!! I speak from experience.Third: (this is minor) Although it meets the system requirements, this computer, for whatever reason, will NOT playLord of the Rings: Conquest.

Sony Backup thing keeps popping up when computer is turned on and no way to make it go away, even after clicking \"don't show again\".Media control button stopped working.Function buttons that adjusts the brightness, sound, screen position stopped working.Screen started flickering.I've only had this computer for 3 months. Love the pinkness and hate everything else.Spent hours talking to tech support on Dec 23 online and on the phone.  Was told to take computer into local service desk.  Found one at Beverly Center and spent Christmas Eve there. Technician told me I have to have the receipt with me (would be nice for them to tell me when I called to make the appointment). And that they have to ship in the computer and it would take at least 2 weeks for me to get it back because the Service Desk can't do anything at the store except help customers ship in the computer.Spent another 45 min on the phone with Service Center on the phone to schedule someone to come out instead.Was told technician would come out and fix it in 3 business days.  3 business days have come and gone... no calls.. so called in today to find out what's up.  Been on the phone for 2 hours now just to try to get the time the technician would come out.Asked them what part was shipped out to fix these problems and was told \"the fan\".  AMAZING FAN!!! A simple fan can fix all these issues!!!!Turns out that Sony outsource the service to a company called Nexicore and after 2 hours, Sony just told me here's the number to Nexicore... try calling them. Sweet deal.
