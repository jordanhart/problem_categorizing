{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Laptop!", "Author": "Jason", "ReviewID": "RGHWSUDSXUXD4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop during the Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals. I paid $498.94 after tax.I have the model with 8GB of DDR3 memory and the Intel Core i5-3210 @ 2.5Ghz CPU.Everything on this laptop works great with the exception of the slow hard drive @ 5400rpm. It's a great amount of space, but I want my operating system and applications to load faster, so I'll be throwing in a Solid State Drive in this thing.Through some research I've found that this particular model typically does not have support for mSATA devices, but there is a part # from Dell that you can order for around $15 that will allow you to install a SSD without removing the primary hard disk or the CDROM drive. The part number is N7JHH (Daughterboard w/ mSATA port) from Dell. Once you've installed this part, you can install an mSATA drive to the board to host your operating system, and leave the 1TB 5400RPM drive to host your data.If you don't like the idea of buying the daughterboard from DELL and installing it, you can also buy a \"2nd HDD Caddy\" or a new \"Disk Bay Adapter\" for the laptop, which just replaces the CD-ROM drive with a SATA drive (its okay, you can use an external cdrom drive or just use USB drives for everything). A good place to look is newmodeus.comI love how all of the USB ports are now 3.0 and it has the 3rd Gen Intel Chip w/ graphics.I dislike how the power port and RJ45 now on the sides instead of the back like in the older models, but its a minor flaw.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Touchpad has issues and the customer service is the worst on the planet", "Author": "Scully", "ReviewID": "R31W5V0LWJ4CRD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I started having touchpad issues shortly after purchasing this and should have just gotten a refund but the dell service people said they could fix it. They reset something and it didn't help the problem. When I called back they kept saying they had resolved it and kept transferring me to three people in india to tell my story again and again and they only they had the same reply again and again. They had resolved it last time yet they wanted to charge me to do the same procedure again that didn't work the first time. They kept me on the phone for 45 mintues without even addressing the touchpad issue just that I had called before on the issue and it had been \"resolved\" which it hadn't. So essentially they offered no help and insinuated I was a liar and ultimately they hung up on me or got disconnected and never called me back despite taking my phone number down in case we got disconnected. I will never buy a Dell again, what a horrible company. I miss my acer laptop.DON'T BUY A DELL. THEIR CUSTOMERS SERVICE WILL SHAVE YEARS OFF IN YOUR LIFE IN TERMS OF STRESS.", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "HOT HOT HOT", "Author": "Ben Richards", "ReviewID": "R48QQ4GIYLFR2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The specs look great but the this laptop overheats so much.1. After owning it for about 12 months, the battery failed. Now I have to replace the battery or it dies within 10 minutes unplugged.2. I treat the laptop with a lot of care, yet all the plastic pieces at the side have broken off.3. It was so slow I had to downgrade my appearance to maximize performance. SO much for 8gbs of ram...4. Burning Hot! The laptop fan does not work well so it is burning hot. I cannot keep it on my lap and I need to put it on it's back every half hour or so.DO NOT. Be allured by the nice specs, this laptop is NOT good", "Date": "March 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Motherboard Failed on Dell Inspiron 15R 5520 Laptop Computer Less Than a Year Old", "Author": "wlj", "ReviewID": "R1A8A1LE3PU6Y8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased this Dell Inspiron 15R 5520 Laptop Computer less than a year ago because I thought it would be reliable, and can't believe the motherboard failed shortly before the one year warranty was up.Dell Laptop Computers are expensive and should last for more than one year. Not everyone can afford $500-$700 every year for a new one - won't buy a Dell Laptop Computer again.

Within the first year the computer stoped charging itself. No not the battery, the motherboard. Called DELL and the next day a tech was at the house and replaced the motherboard. Worked well within the first year having the warrenty. The same exact problem came back 4 months later outside of the warrenty period, their answer was to bad and it will be 400 dollars to replace the mother board after you send it back to us.
