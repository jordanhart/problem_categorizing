{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Terrible HP Experience with this DV6T Laptop", "Author": "Barrie Pike \"Quick Snapper\"", "ReviewID": "R2BT8NUP33XUVL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased an HP DV6T - 3000 3 weeks ago. The DVD burner did not work from the outset and caused me to waste 6 disks before I gave up on it. It then started blue screening a couple of days ago. It now blue screens every 10 mins or so. Tech support traced the issue to bad memory or a faulty memory cradle. They offered to resolve the issue by either having me send back the laptop by post (a 2 week turnaround) or purchase at home support cover for $130. They refused to accept that the machine was a shoddy peice of workmanship and send someone to my home to fix it. I need to get back up and productive asap so have no choice but to purchase the at home cover and get an engineer out. Conclusion - HP sell me a really poor piece of workmanship that I have to pay them to have fixed.", "Date": "September 30, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,449.99", "Features": null, "Name": "HP Notebook DV6T Select Edition - Windows 7, Intel Core i7-720QM Quad Core processor (1.6GHz) with Turbo Boost up to 2.8 GHz, 6 GB DDR3, 500 GB HD, 1GB ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5650 Graphics [HDMI, VGA], Blu-ray ROM with SuperMulti DVD+/-R/RW, Intel Wireless-N Card, Bluetooth,Webcam, Fingerprint Reader, 15.6\" diagonal High Definition LED HP Brightview Widescreen Display (1366x768)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/11e3%2BDDHruL.jpg", "ProductID": "B003XO7PNU"}}
