It is perfect as a travelling laptop. screen  is vivid, keyboard fits and feels good to the touch. speed is adequate but ok for my use. i purchased a clear plastic cover that fits snugly and protects the surface from scratches. I would recommend as a decent quality laptop in the lower price range.", "Date": "October 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great and Affordable Ultrabook", "Author": "JR", "ReviewID": "R1K5JR4JMR3E8I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace my bulky and heavy Dell (older) laptop that I take to work. That laptop used to be the the top of the line  ($1800) laptop and was constantly concerned that it would be taken or broken so I bought this one since it was fairly cheap (<$400) and it would take up less space. I am just a casual computer user so the specs don't really concern me but I can say it is a fast and lightweight ultrabook. I use it mainly for web surfing and school work. This model doesn't have a media drive which doesn't bother me because now most music or media is in cloud or streamed. The keyboard is comfortable for my large hands. The speakers are decent for listening to music while you work or play which is exactly what I am doing now while typing this review. I read some of the online reviews and they mentioned how the case seems cheap but for my first non metal case laptop I am impressed. It is light, it seems sturdy, quiet (no rattles or groaning), and nice matte finish cover. All in all a really nice ultra book for those who are on a budget who want something that is speedy and looks nice.The only con is that the battery doesn't last as long as I am accustomed but I can tweak the settings and should be able to extend that.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "She loves it", "Author": "Smoothdark \"smoothdark\"", "ReviewID": "R3F6DOFH2UUTUI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this product to replace a Dell laptop for my wife. So far so good! She is happy with it.
