{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great balance of portability and power", "Author": "Yu-jin Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"", "ReviewID": "R29EB4LDHIMTUU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Some time ago, I told myself I'd never buy another so-called 'gaming' laptop. I mainly use laptops for work, and as far as that goes I rarely need a really powerful machine- portability is a lot more useful. Laptops are by nature a set of compromises, and I've found that as far as game-ready hardware goes it's a lot cheaper and you have many more options building a desktop. However, the state of the art in mobile hardware has advanced to the point that I decided it was worth taking a look. There are some models now that combine both portability and power, which was previously either false advertising or wishful thinking.When you buy a laptop you're getting some balance of power, portability, durability, expandability, and heat/noise. These unfortunately are conflicting traits- you will simply not find a machine that is excellent in all areas. The ones that approach it are often hideously expensive too. I took my time looking around and did extensive research on many models. I've used and owned a lot of laptops over the years, including several that could be considered gaming notebooks (including a high end MacBook Pro and an 8-core ASUS ROG monster). There are a lot of choices out there, but these requirements cut it down quite a bit:1. Weight around 5 lbs and screen size 15.6\" or less. On weight I'd be willing to go to 7 lbs, but not an ounce higher. I do not consider most 17+ inch laptops to be reasonably portable.2. Screen resolution at least 1600x900. Anything less is just too little real estate.3. Powerful enough to run most games on at least med quality. This ruled out most integrated GPUs except possibly Iris/Iris Pro.4. Large storage capacity and/or ability to expand it.5. At least 3 hours battery life on average load. This ties back into the 'reasonably portable' thing. A lot of laptops, especially gaming rigs, have battery life in the sub-2 hour range even when just browsing, which means you're essentially tethered to an outlet.6. Budget was a factor. I did not have $2000+ to burn on this.For all intents and purposes this narrowed it down to 3 machines:MSI GE40Clevo W230SS (a.k.a. Sager NP7338)Gigabyte P34Gv2The Razer Blade 14 and retina MacBook Pro were also distant contenders, but I dropped them due to poor screen/GPU (respectively) and high cost. They simply looked too expensive for the hardware. I liked the GE40's tested battery life (up to 7 hrs) but it's over a year old, still about as expensive as the other two (which are both very current), and there are a lot of reports that it runs consistently hot. That left the Clevo W230SS and P34Gv2. This was a tough call; the Clevo is an excellent machine spec-wise and has twin mSATA plus a 2.5\" bay for great storage options. It's also a bit cheaper. But the P34 is lighter and thinner (despite larger screen size) and has more VRAM. I decided the difference in cost was worth the nicer form factor and extra video memory. However, I do recommend that buyers with similar requirements at least look at the Clevo- it is a very strong alternative.The P34Gv2 is a good compromise of attributes and fully meets my requirements. It packs very respectable hardware into a light and thin chassis, has decent battery life, and is reasonably well-built. First, a general overview of the unit...Hardware: The P34Gv2 has the latest generation Haswell core i7 @ 2.4 ghz, comes with default 8 GB of RAM, and has dual GPUs (integrated Intel HD4600, discrete GeForce GTX 860M 4 GB). The 860M is the Maxwell core variant and uses surprisingly low power for what it can do. Hardware-wise, this machine is bleeding edge for a portable and can easily run any of the latest games at full HD with at least high detail if not ultra.Screen: This is a full HD (1920x1080) IPS panel and is superb. It has excellent viewing angles and color, and is very bright at full power. At 50% power it's easily viewable in normal lighting conditions. This is one of the best monitors I've seen on any portable.Input: This machine has a full size keyboard that has a nice feel to it. I'd hesitate to call it as good as a MacBook Pro's, but it's not far off. There is a bit of flex in it, but it's not serious. It's got a two-power electroluminescent backlight that is very effective in the dark. The Elantech trackpad is decent- not the best one out there, but not the worst either. It's plenty wide but not very tall, and the buttons are a bit stiff and narrow. I do wish they'd somehow stick a Mac trackpad on this guy, but the pad does suffice for general tasks and supports some multitouch gestures (note: some things like two-finger tap need registry edits). For gaming, you'd probably want a mouse anyway. The microphone and webcam work- they're nothing special and the camera is a bit weak, but Skype video quality is probably not going to be your #1 requirement if you're looking at this machine.Connectivity: The P34Gv2 comes with standard 802.11ac wireless and has good range and signal pickup. It has integrated bluetooth which can help with that trackpad problem. It does have an ethernet jack which is nice, as many laptops with this form factor don't.Battery: The battery on this laptop is a non-swappable lithium polymer. It can actually be removed if you disassemble the machine, and I've heard rumors there's an extended version available somewhere that takes up the 2.5\" drive bay for added charge (purportedly up to 7 hrs normal load). However, as is it is pretty decent- I get 5 hrs of life doing light tasks on a full charge, 3 hrs with moderately high settings doing more serious things (e.g. installing software, running tests), and about 1.5 hrs gaming. This is comparable to or better than most other machines in its class. It won't compete with a battery-optimized ultrabook, but it's a whole lot more powerful than any of those.Storage: The P34Gv2 has a dual-storage solution with one mSATA and one 2.5\" SATA III bay, configurable for RAID 0/1. It comes stock with a 128GB mSATA SSD and 1 TB 5400 RPM 2.5\" drive. This is a very nice setup- combines great speed and storage. You can always swap out the 2.5\" for an SSD, which I plan to do when a large capacity gets reasonably affordable.Chassis: The machine is black plastic top and bottom, aluminum on the inside. It has access covers for the drives and memory on the bottom and is surprisingly easy to take apart. Dual vents come out the back, and the twin fans do keep it cool (except for the exhaust, which can get uncomfortably warm). Temps are generally not a problem here, which is surprising for such a powerful machine. There's no built-in optical drive, which is expected for a machine this size. It includes HDMI, Ethernet, 4 USB (2x2.0 2x3.0 including one charge port), and an SD slot. Power and status lights are on the front lip below the trackpad. The built-in speakers are not bad and do a decent approximation of surround sound. I wouldn't call this machine rugged in any sense of the word, but it is well-built and does not feel or look flimsy.Other: It comes in nice packaging, similar to a MacBook. A velcro sleeve is also included, which is pretty cool (and not noted on the product page).Overall, I'm very pleased with this machine. It can run any of my (rather extensive) library of games on at least high settings. While technically not an ultrabook, it has similar dimensions and weight, and is even comparable in battery life to some. The keyboard is comfortable to type on, and the screen is excellent. However, I will point out two cons that are noteworthy:1. It gets noisy under load. I knew this before buying, and it's to be expected. It's not 'full-afterburners takeoff' loud, but it's enough that you probably want to use headphones while gaming. Under light use like browsing, the machine is quiet.2. The power brick is simply massive. It's easily the largest, heaviest laptop adapter I've seen- makes 90W Lenovo bricks look dainty in comparison. It weighs nearly as much as the laptop itself, so if you're expecting to need a charge it seriously crimps portability. I'm looking into a low profile replacement for travel. Despite its size and output (120W) I have noticed that when the laptop is under load it doesn't put out enough power to charge the battery, just keep the machine running. It does charge very fast when the P34G is asleep though (full in about an hour).If you can live with those two points, this is a sweet laptop for a great price. It's thin, light, very powerful, and has decent battery life despite that. Going by specs alone, the P34Gv2 is a very solid piece of hardware for the cost, more powerful than similarly-priced (and much larger) offerings by MSI, ASUS, and Alienware. This one is very easy to recommend if you need a portable but powerful machine.Edit 5/10/14- I'm pleased to report that I have in fact found a nice replacement power brick for this guy. The Codi 100W universal adapter with the 'C' tip fits fine, and has enough output to charge this notebook. It is considerably smaller and lighter (about half) and with a USB charge port to boot. Find it here: CODi Universal Notebook AC Power Adapter 100 Watt, BlackEdit 5/25/14- I broke down and replaced the stock 1TB HDD with an SSD. The stock drive is a Toshiba 5400 RPM SATA II- a bit slow to be honest. It's fine for mass storage of stuff you don't need a ton of bandwidth on, e.g. pictures, movies, and music. If you're a gamer though, you probably need a faster drive (whether it be the mSATA or this one). I opted to leave the stock mSATA with the OS on it and replace the 2.5\" with a Samsung 840EVO. Now this machine is seriously fast- as fast as the desktop game rig I built a year and a half ago. Not bad considering that thing weighs about 60 lbs :-)", "Date": "May 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "You can't beat this laptop in term of spec and price", "Author": "YY", "ReviewID": "R3388R5MDY71OV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As someone who travels for work quite a bit for work, I need something light to carry with me when I travel. I have Surface Pro as my main PC and it has been great, but it is a terrible gaming machine, it barely run Starcraft II reasonably. So when I got Wolfenstein: The New Order, I knew I needed something better. The P34G V2 is THE lightest laptop (@3.75lbs)with the Geforce 860m GTX, go ahead, look around, nothing else that has a 860m weight less than 4lbs. So far I had the laptop for 1 week and the experience has been great. I stress tested the laptop, overclocked the 860m (not that it needs it) and tested the battery, so far so great! I have to say I am very impressed with the build quality of this laptop. Don't get me wrong, it's not a business grade laptop, it's a consumer level laptop so you have to handle it with care. But pretty much everything is well built.Reviewer Yu-jin Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"  did a great job with the in-depth review on the laptop specs, so I don't have to repeat what he said about the laptop, but there are a few points I like to add:- Fan noise: Yes, it gets loud when you game, it's a gaming laptop, what do you expect? There are youtube videos that do noise testing, you can check it out. But when you work, you can set the fan to \"stealth\" which greatly reduce the fan speed and therefore, noise.- Power supply: Yes, it's a big one, not as thick as other power supply, but pretty big. My theory is that Gigabyte standardize on their gaming laptop power supplies to support all their power hungry gaming laptops. That's because the power supply technically supports 150W! (19.5v, 7.7A ) The laptop itself at MAX wouldn't really exceed 100W (CPU@47W, GPU@45W, ~8W for others), I would recommend a second, small 90-100W power adapter for day to day carry. I use Innergie mCube Slim 95W with no issue, it peak at 120W and deliver 95W constant which is fine to power the P34G V2 even when playing games- Spinning Hard drive: I suggest replacing the spinning hard drive ASAP, or buy the laptop without it. I replaced the 1TB 5400rpm drive with a 240GB SSD I had laying around, the performance improvement is extreme just like Yu-jin Chia said. However, there is another reason for it. For the sake size reduction, there are NO bracket holding the HD in place, just a plastic sleeve with a little foam and the bottom laptop cover hold it in place. This means there will always be a bit of vibration for the 2.5inch HDD, which can kill it pretty fast if you move around often. For me who travel a quite bit, putting my data on such a drive is just asking for it. SSD, on the other hand, has not such issue since it doesn't rotate, and it weight a bit less also.All in all, the ownership experience for P34Gv2 has been great, it is tastefully designed so it doesn't scream \"Gamer\", I can bring it to client meetings without shame and use it on battery comfortably for around 4 hours. Yes, you can get 860m based gaming laptop for less (not much less spec for spec and you won't get a 2 year global warranty), but most of this are at least 0.5 to 1lb heavier, or thicker, or both. If you're looking a something thin and light that packs some serious gaming horsepower, you can't go wrong with the P34gV2P.S. This thing (the 860m) overclock like a dream, I was able to get 4257 in Firestrike benchmark after just very simple overclock with Afterburner on a locked vBIOS. To Compare, a stock 870m Kepler score around 4300 in Firestrike.

This is understandable because the battery is not powerful enough.Second, GTX 860m in this labtop is suppose to have better performance than GTX675m in my Samsung Gamer 7, however, this laptop lags A LOT when I tried to play medal of honor warfighter in low settings.It even lagged when I tried to play SWAT 4, which is not even a high end game! The system message said that I don't have enough graphic memory space.My direct X is the most recent one. And it says that It is using GTX860m graphics not onboard intel graphics.
