{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "JBM", "ReviewID": "RY51SNJC6H88J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my MSI Dominator-895 yesterday and my first impression is that it is an amazing machine.Packaging: The computer arrived very well protected. A box within a box within a box, all very tightly packed to allow no movement of the computer components inside. Additionally the laptop had a cloth layer, an antistatic plastic layer, and the screen had a soft cloth protective layer. I have never seen packaging this goodLook and feel:Chassis: Very well built. The brushed aluminum/hard plastic chassis feels very solid. There is absolutely no flex when picking the machine up (although it does have quite the heft at 8.6lbs lol). I have previously owned toshibas and acers that felt flimsy and easy to break.Keyboard: The keyboard is great, the keys are responsive and quiet. The backlighting is a nice feature that can be toggled on and off. Every key is programmable for you nerds and your mmo's *ahem me*.Touchpad; The touchpad is nice as well. It is large and the buttons react as expected. I haven't really explored any of the features due to the fact that I am a mouse kinda guy.Display: The anti-glare display is one of my favorite features. Coupled with the 870m nvidia graphics card the display is crisp and clear. I play FFXIV and have never had a smoother, beautifully rendered picture. As a side note the laptop supports up to 3 additional monitors. I set up the rig at home with the laptop in the middle, and an LCD on either side(one RGB the other HDMI). It is fantastic.The guts:HDD: the 1TB 7200rpm drive is quiet, and works great. The computer has an additional bay for a sata drive. I installed a 250gb solid state drive  for the operating system and applications that I wanted to run lighting fast. With the SSD my machine boots to desktop in about 10 seconds.Nvidia 870m graphics: Amazing....smoothest gaming experience that i've ever had. The laptop comes with an app called the Gforce experience. Within the app you can adjust the graphics performance as well as launch your games.16gb RAM: Never a bad thing. Sooooo fast.Jacks: it comes with 3 usb 3.0, 2 usb 2.0 and gold plated headphone jacks.Dynaudio sound system: The sound system is awesome too. It gets surprisingly loud for a laptop.Cooler Booster. At the touch of a button you can enable extra fan power to cool the machine down. It is pretty loud, but I don't anticipate using it a lot. The site says that it will cool the cpu down by 15%. I have yet to test it.*****UPDATE*******I've had this machine for a month now, and I am still as happy as the day I bought it. Originally I was going to choose a Fangbook Evo hx7 from cyberpower, but I am soooo happy I went this route.", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "For gamers: This PC is great!!!", "Author": "Sergii Todorashko", "ReviewID": "R3GTFYZJY81MF0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For gamers: This PC is great!!!The design is pretty good, all slots are in place were supposed to be for proper operation. Charger,HDMI, and Display port on back side, USB3 from left USB 2 from right. Location of cooling fan makes youstay free of heat. Someone say fan is noisy, yes he\u2019s really noisy, but for this performance is requiredbig and strong cooler, other way you GPU and CPU will burn. When you play in Battlefield 4 on \u201cUltra\u201dwith 50-60 fps you will be concentrating on grade quality of pictures and high quality of sound andforget about all the rest. So for me it is not a big minus. I\u2019m wary like that they made a buttons for quickstart fan on full speed (+), one touch for fan and start game\u2026 good idea. The screen is made with goodquality and full HD, is wary good for game and in general. I\u2019m play in game first day 6.5 hours nonstopand I\u2019m not feel that my eyes is tired. So screen +. Keyboard is great +. My rate from 1 to 10 is 10.I\u2019m known there are many other good laptops, but I\u2019m comparing price, performance and quality ofmaterials.Only one suggestion for maker: for the same money put SSD instead of windows 8.1 and DVD SuperMulti. The people who bay laptop for more than 1000$ can install operation system which they like.", "Date": "June 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "5 starts for the laptop, 3 stars for the seller", "Author": "kimoo", "ReviewID": "R2NCK9ZZA7RGTR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the laptop it self is a beast when it comes to gaming till this moment i didnt have any issue running any game with this beast in ultra settings so 5 stars to MSI for making such a great laptopmeanwhile ...for the seller i would give him 3 stars because like the rest of the reviews my unit had also a dead pixel on the right and after a 3 days of e-mailing the seller they gave me $50 refund ( because i couldn't returned the unit for repair/exchange cause i shipped it out of the US nor contacting MSI service cause there is non in my country ), the one thing that upsets me there is a paper that came with the laptop from the seller says that the laptop had been tested and it is free of any defect and the screen is tested and have no dead pixels/black bars... etc and yet i had a dead pixel and when i contacted them they said it maybe had a dead pixel while shipping or something because they test the unit twice with 2 technicians.but any way the seller had a very tempting offer while MSI was selling the same laptop in 8GB of ram this seller was offering 16GB and with the same price tag so it was a great deal .", "Date": "April 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "GREAT PC + GREAT PRICE = 5 STARS", "Author": "tracy", "ReviewID": "R3PBZ8T9J4PMHD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To everyone thinking about buying a laptop, I would definitely recommend this PC.The stats for this product are by far the best gaming laptop out there. Go and search for videos and reviews comparing this laptop to other gaming ones, such as: ASUS (Republic of Gamers), Alienware, Razer, Qosmio, whatever and you will see that this laptop is always a bit ahead of the other competitors. AND IT IS LIKE %40 OFF!!!Don't hesitate, the only real problem was a huge sticker that said \"Computer King Upgrade\" next to my mouse pad that left a huge sticky mess when I took it off. But luckily I managed to remove it using only a bit a water and a semi rough cloth.
