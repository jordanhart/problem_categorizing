{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Product was defective, but seller is doing an exchange.", "Author": "quaero4", "ReviewID": "RJSOKPBJ52O0N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was initially upset because I thought the seller had not responded to my problems with the item.  He has, in fact, responded and has agreed to accept a return and provide a replacement.  More on this later after I receive the replacement item.  This was to have been a \"refurbished\" machine, but was not and had a few problems.  The seller sells both refurbished and used machines and got the order confused.  I think he is making good on correcting the error.", "Date": "April 7, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Genuine Windows 7 Home Premium\nCore i7 2.13GHz processor\n4 GB DDR3 memory\n120 GB hard drive", "Name": "HP Elitebook 2540p Notebook, Core i7 2.13GHz, 120GB, 4GB, DVD-RW, 12\" Widescreen Display, Sold by a Microsoft Authorized Refurbisher", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ePHVRi8AL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0043Z7VBO"}}
