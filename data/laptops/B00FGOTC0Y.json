{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Bigger Brother", "Author": "A. Dent \"Aragorn\"", "ReviewID": "R21TXO8G6H5LP4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "HP's Chromebook 14 is our third Chromebook because, after one year with Samsung Chromebook I came to realize that not only a Chromebook does almost everything a laptop or a PC or a tablet would do for me but it does it cheaper, usually faster and better, almost always worry-free and very much in style. We've ordered a nice HP Chromebook 11 since and now, because someone in our household wanted a one that was 'bigger', we went for the '14'.WHY A CHROMEBOOK?There's so much to say here but let me make a quick summary. And never forget that we are talking about an 'under 300' device here because, yes, anything that costs 3-4-5 times as much should do better most of the time.\u02d5 Our Chromebooks are our most used computers excluding work hours and by 'computer' I mean PCs, laptops and tablets.\u02d5 Malware, spyware, adware-free. Since nothing is really 'installed' on the Chromebook, I can't see how one would ever be infected. I am now using my Chromebook to open suspicious emails or click on dubious URLs that I don't dare touch from a laptop.\u02d5 Extremely safe OS. I don't know if this is common knowledge but Google is constantly challenging hackers to crack their OS. As far as I know, Chromium wasn't cracked yet.\u02d5 Easy to share among any number of users without any concerns of compromising privacy. If you have a Google account, you simply sign in and you are going to be within your own, personal environment.\u02d5 Constantly updated and upgraded. Google updates Chromium every few weeks and I found my Chromebook actually getting better all the time rather than slowly fall into obsolescence. HP's Chromebook will not replace Samsung's, it will be used by another family member who really, really wanted one after watching my happy relationship with our first one.\u02d5 Nearly maintenance free. Whenever I don't use a tablet or even a laptop for a while, they tend to get very busy for a while once I turn them back on. Tablets, especially, are almost impossible to use until all those dozens of updates/upgrades process. Not the case for Chromebooks. Whatever upgrades may take place don't hit my Chromebook. Whenever I call up an app, I get it in its latest version.\u02d5 The attached keyboard helps a lot. Yes, you can pair a keyboard and even a mouse to a tablet but the Chromebook's keyboard is always there, it negates the need of a stand or even some protecting case.\u02d5 Chromium is streamlined and efficiently focused where it matters, on the everyday uses most of us need a 'computer' most of the time.\u02d5 Chromium being such a streamlined OS, browsing and running apps on a Chromebook is in fact faster than off a PC/laptop/tablet of equivalent specs.\u02d5 Relatively low prince, 11.6\" display and light weight seem to be just about right for something that typically you'd be using to browse the Web while watching TV or take to and from school.WHY NOT A CHROMEBOOK?Yes, Chromebooks can't do everything. Google's productivity suites notwithstanding, they are mainly and they are best at media consumption rather than production. Nobody should buy a Chromebook and expect to be able to edit video or perform some heavy word processing or do some hard-core gaming. There are other machines and devices for such tasks. My experience is that a Chromebook can't do 'everything'. Tablets are more portable, PCs and laptops are more powerful but, to me, my Chromebook is the most fun to use and it's likely to stay this way. I am not going to call it my 'second' or 'third' or 'first' computer but, objectively, it's the one most use outside business hours if what we measure is 'hours'.HP's CHROMEBOOK 14 vs. Chromebook 11Having owned two other Chromebooks already, from the start, it was a very familiar feeling. HP's 14 is not 'exactly like' Samsung's and this big HP is quite different from HP's Chromebook 11 but it's easily recognizable as a Chromebook.Here are some changes:\u02d5 DISPLAY: HP 11's colors are sharper and brighter and you can view the screen from almost any angle left/right or up/down. HP 14's is not as bright and the larger size doesn't come with better resolution.\u02d5 KEYBOARD. It's a draw. I like both keyboards as they have a good layout and nice travel. As a touch typist I am comfortable with both.\u02d5 DESIGN: HP 11's is more stylish design but they are both Okay as far as I can tell. HP 11 is nicer though.\u02d5 PORTS: This is where the HP 14 wins big time. It comes with USB 3.0 ports vs. HP 11's USB 2.0 and full HDMI.\u02d5 POWER: It's not too obvious but yes, the HP 14 is sometimes faster refreshing screens. Videos play equally smoothly on both.\u02d5 SIZE AND WEIGHT: HP 14 is a lot heavier so if you travel and size and weight matters then HP 11 is the right choice. If your Chromebook is mostly homebound and most of your computing and media playing takes place in a room shielded from direct or indirect sunlight then the HP 14 gives you the bigger display advantage.Overall I like HPs larger Chromebook. It has better ports options than the HP 11, it's faster and you get a bigger screen on a body that's not as light and pretty.RATINGI am not going to compare a 300 dollar HP Chromebook with the Pixel or some top of the line laptop. I noticed that many 'pro' reviewers are complaining because Chromebooks and this particular one are not 'high end' and aren't as nice as the Pixel and such. Well... did anyone check the prices? So, yes, let me make a 'duh' statement: this Chromebook is not as good as devices that sell for 3 times or 4 times as much so anyone who doesn't mind paying more should pay more and get one of those. Even though... look at some reasons above for why one my prefer a Chromebook to a laptop or a tablet, regardless of price.HP's 14 is a four-star to me because it's at least as good and in some way better than my now one year old, often used and much trusted Samsung but I personally prefer the HP 11. As far as performance, they both appear to be up to the task and they both played Netflix movies flawlessly over Wi-Fi and cast them to the big TV through Chromecast.Chromebooks are not for everyone and they are not a universal computing device but, if used for what they are meant to be used, they are as good and as revolutionary as tablets.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just as nice as expected", "Author": "Just another Music/Web/Technology Lover \"rdf\"", "ReviewID": "RTJWBT025KO5A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had high hopes for this laptop.  I already knew the differences between a chromebook and a typical PC, so no issues there.I picked up this system from Walm*** a few days ago.  The model I purchased also includes 2 years of Tmobile data.I specifically choose the HP 14\" model because of its quality and size.  Much better size than the competing 11.5\" systems.  Also, true to HP, nice quality.Size, speed, quality, keyboard, trackpad are all great.  If I had one negative it would be the lack of lighted keyboard.  On the plus side, the system I received has 4 GB ram, so an upgrade from the 2 GB listed on Amazon.  This system fits its intended use perfectly.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Really nice machine... feels very \"Apple\" inspired, great second computer", "Author": "Goldengate \"Goldengate\"", "ReviewID": "RDUTXQRIXBLVD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought the 4G version of this for fifty more at the local W-Mart.  The other big difference between that model and this one is that the version with the roaming T-mobile data plan (free for 2 years) also has 2 GB more memory so theoretically the machine should be faster than the wi-fi only version.I'll review the things in common however.Screen:  Good size, easy to adjust brightness with dedicated up and down keys at the top of the keyboard (just like Apple).  I'm reading that the Chromebook 11 version has a nicer display and that the 11 was actually co-created with Google vs. the 14 which was supposedly designed solely by HP.Appearance:  I got the machine in white.  Snow White to be exact.  It looks awesome on the kitchen counter.  The aluminum cover around the keyboard looks great and reminds me of much more expensive Apple machines.  (OK I'll stop mentioning Apple, the whole darn thing reminds me of a $1500 Apple in appearance)Speakers:  I'm listening to Pandora as I type this.  Zero bass response but speakers still sound decent for listening to music, but if you want bass, this is NOT the machine for you.  There is a headset jack.Connections:  Speaking of jacks, there are two USB ports on the left and one on the right. There's also a HDMI output on the left so you can stream video and audio to your TV.Usability:  No, you can't easily run Microsoft Excel and Outlook on this machine.  I've read you can remote into your networked desktop and use them there but I haven't used that.  However Gmail and the Google cloud based equivalents of the Office Suite are fine.  This machine starts up almost instantly... it's like turning on a phone.  You turn it on and moments late you are checking gmail and Facebook and surfing the web.I wouldn't want this as my only computer as I do need a non-cloud based computer as well, but as an inexpensive mobile computer I find this a great alternative to my iPad at half the cost.I asked Amazon if they will be selling the 4G version of this and really didn't get a definitive answer but I'm guessing since WM is already \"live\" with it that they have some sort of an exclusive deal for now.Also, rumor has it that Toshiba and Asus will be coming out with Chrombooks for the holidays so you might want to wait to see what they offer.My biggest concern about this model was the 2 GB of memory in the wifi only version...  the reviews of other Chromebooks I've read (and I've read dozens) indicate to me that Chrome really operates best with 4 GB if you like to have lots of open tabs.A great little machine!!!", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "An outstanding device", "Author": "Krisztian Koncz", "ReviewID": "R3RSORGOVYG9IA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although I bought My chromebook 14 in the UK, it is not available on amazon UK yet, I had to buy it direct from HP. Like the T-mobile version here, mine comes with a built in HSPA+ radio that gives me superfast mobile internet in the area of London where I live, on par with wifi speeds pretty much. This is the first product I reviewed that got a 5-star rating although perhaps 4.75 stars would have been more accurate. The tiny flaws that it does have are balanced out by the stupendously low price, basically this is a machine you can easily compare to a macbook or a windows ultrabook that costs 4 times as much an it will still hold its own. Obviously this is a Chrome OS device so one has to do their research if they can live with a cloud-based OS and there is a very small learning curve when switching, but honestly Chrome OS is so easy to learn, almost anyone should be able to do it. I also wrote a detailed and critical review looking at every little aspect of the device, meant for chromies who are already sold on the concept but need comparisons with other chromebooks available on the market. For my money, this particular model is the best chromebook you can get out there, factoring in things like price, battery life, 4g connectivity and screen size. Without further ado here are my initial impressions:Initial Impressions about the HP chromebook 14 UK 3G version and comparison to the Samsung series 3Feel and QualityThis is definitely a laptop, it feels very different from the samsung, the weight is substantial, it is much bigger and the fan is constantly on and very much audible. I suppose I will just have to get used to the noise, but that is definitely a step back from the Samsung. Some reviewers noted they can only hear the fan when they put their ears next to the keyboard, definitely not the case with me, I hear it all the time when I\u2019m in a quiet room. When I take it to the kitchen, where there is a lot of ambient noise from the fridge, it gets cancelled out and I can\u2019t hear a thing. Most people probably won\u2019t even notice the fan unless they use it at night in their bedrooms.KeyboardThe keyboard has a different feel to it than the samsung, it has textured keys and they keys have slightly more travel. Annoyingly, the keyboard is narrower than on the samsung despite the bigger size of the machine itself, so you get narrower enter, backspace and shift keys. The keyboard otherwise feels good and it is quite silent to type on, but not as much as on the samsung, perhaps that will change with time. The keys are not as rounded as on the samsung and I must say I prefer the typing experience on the samsung so far, but maybe I\u2019ll get used to it in a few days. There is more key travel on the HP, that is definitely in its favour.TrackpadThe trackpad is the same width but slightly taller. I feel no difference in practical use, however the HP has a slightly loose trackpad that rattles every time I tap to click, which is annoying, so I find myself preferring to actually click the trackpad. Thankfully the trackpad requires less pressure to click than on the samsung and the noise is more satisfying. The loose trackpad feels cheap, I\u2019m not sure if this is an issue with my machine in particular or if it is more widespread.ScreenThe 14\u201d screen makes a huge difference in comparison to the Samsung, I don\u2019t have to put on my glasses and I don\u2019t have to zoom in or squint to see text properly. The bigger screen is the main reason I bought this machine and overall I\u2019m satisfied. I did not find the lower PPI to be an issue, you tend to sit a bit further away anyways. The lack of an anti-glare coating is preferable in my case, text appears to be clearer and more crisp. The screen does reflect when switched off, I see no reflections when it is switched on, I keep it at about 80 percent brightness. Reflections from the blazing sun is not an issue we have to grapple with here in the UK. Maximum brightness appears to be about 10 percent higher than on the samsung, it is definitely noticeable and a welcome change. On the other hand contrast ratios are worse and colours are more washed out than on the samsung. Next to each other, the same background photo shows truer colours on the samsung, the setting sun is more orangey. The HP seems to struggle with contrast, for instance a light skinned person on a white background looks quite bad. Also, I find that I need to tilt the screen quite a bit back to get decent contrast ratios when writing and reading text on a white background, then when I watch videos I have to tilt the screen a bit forward to get better colour reproduction. It seems that constantly adjusting the screen is just something that comes with TN panels. But like I said, overall this is a pretty good screen for the price.Materials and Build qualityThis is where the HP truly shines compared to the samsung. This is a beautiful machine, well made, sturdy, quality materials, and the heft seems to add to the quality feel. The plastics used are much thicker than on the samsung, there is no creak when you pick it up. Mine is the snow white colour which is just amazingly gorgeous, I\u2019m truly in love with the look and feel of this. This all comes at a price though, the bottom half of the machine is twice as thick as the samsung, the height difference is noticeable when you are typing on the table. As for weight, this is no macbook air, I definitely won\u2019t be carrying this around as much. I plan to keep this for home use and take the samsung with me when I\u2019m out and about.PerformanceI did not get the opportunity to test this extensively, so these are just initial impressions. My Samsung has increased scrolling performance markedly on the beta channel and when I go to google plus or the notoriously heavy Verge I see no difference between the two machines in normal scrolling. The HP seems to drop frames just as much as the samsung. Where I see a real difference is in loading times, pages load in about half the time on the HP and the waiting time to be able to scroll without jerkiness or checkerboarding is also about half of what you get on the samsung. Same goes for switching between tabs. Where the HP 14 really leaves the samsung in the dust is watching HD videos, there is just no comparison. The Samsung can just about handle HD streaming in netflix, but when it comes to youtube or other flash-based streaming sites, it struggles to play videos smoothly, there are missed frames, jumping and jerkiness. Also, I found that with the samsung switching between resolutions or going full window and back is problematic and really taxes the cpu. No such problems here, the HP plays everything beautifully, HD videos are crisp and fluid, they look beautiful on the large, glossy screen. Perhaps the only drawback of the glossy screen is when you watch dark scenes, you can see your own reflection a bit, but not a huge issue overall. The speakers are loud and clear, they are noticeably more powerful than the one on the samsung. Of course there is zero base, but they are still fine speakers for a laptop. Overall, if you like to watch videos and movies on your chromebook, the HP leaves the samsung in the dust, image quality, fluidity, responsiveness and speaker sound are all superior, but that is to be expected from a bigger machine.ConnectivityWifi performance is fine, same as the samsung, picks up signals easily. This model comes with mobile internet included. In the UK, as in the US it is an HSPA+ wireless radio. In the US this is marketed as 4G, in the UK this is considered 3G or 3.5G according to some marketing materials. It is faster than normal 3G, but it won\u2019t be up to LTE speeds. The network provider is Fogg Mobile, a Swedish telecom company who have effectively outsourced the service to Three. I already have a mobile phone contract with Three and mobile internet speeds in my area are relatively fast (Wapping in East London), actually they are usually better than what I get from my BT wired broadband over wifi. Fogg mobile gives you 250 MB data per month free for 2 years, which is only enough to use in an emergency when nothing else is available. I will generally stick to wifi and tethering, but it is a good option to have and the sim is swappable, so you can easily get an unlimited mobile data SIM card from Three for around \u00a315 per month which should give you constant internet coverage without having to use wifi or tethering. The only problem I have with Three is that they don\u2019t always have their own masts, so when you head to central london you have to make do with the very low bandwidth that they manage to rent from other providers and at peak times that is nonexistent in places like the city. Still, you can insert a sim from any provider if they have better service in your area.I tested HSPA+ vs BT broadband speed in Wapping at 5.30 PM with no one else connected to the wifi network. Streaming speeds were 6537 kbps on three\u2019s mobile network, almost twice of what is minimally recommended for HD video streaming. ON BT wifi I got 9837 kbps, which is around 50 percent higher but in real world use both connection speeds are fine.Battery LifeI had no chance to test this yet, at the moment I am at 90 percent charge and the machine estimates 7.5 hours of charge left, which seems to fall in line with what most people get. I\u2019d say 8 hours is a reasonable expectation from this machine, but this will go down steeply if you stream HD videos. As for heat, the bottom of the machine is completely cool to the touch and it seems you don\u2019t get the annoying spinning up of the fans that you get from windows laptops and macbooks when you tax the CPU. The Haswell microarchitecture really shines here.ConclusionOverall I am happy with my purchase, the HP Chromebook 14 is a significant step up from the Samsung series 3. What you gain in screen size, performance, quality and looks you lose in portability and weight, so you have to examine your usage scenarios to see if this is the right machine for you. My feeling is that for the time being this is the Macbook Pro of budget chromebooks. It is heavier and more expensive than the Acer C720 or or the Samsung, but it will serve you better as a desktop replacement and it is more suitable as a workspace. Built in mobile internet is also a huge plus in my eyes as unlimited data plans are becoming more common in the UK, so you could conceivably use this machine without ever needing to connect to wifi, therefore saving yourself a bunch on a wired broadband subscription. I think that the HP14 offers real value for money, particularly in the UK where laptops are significantly more expensive than in the US even if you factor in the 20% VAT. To give you an idea about the value proposition, the 3G model costs \u00a3279 whilst the Wifi only model is priced at \u00a3250 at the online UK HP store. To find a windows laptop that has comparable specs and build quality, you would have to pay at least twice as much, with apple you will have to pay 3-4 times as much. When it comes to chromebooks, the ACER C720 and the Samsung both cost \u00a3180 at PC World if you factor in the \u00a320 cashback offer, but both have only 2 GB of ram. For the added quality and screen size, I think \u00a370 is a reasonable price to pay if portability and weight isn\u2019t paramount. It is also worth keeping an eye on special voucher codes, I managed to buy this model at a 10 percent discount, so I paid only \u00a3251 for it, there might be similar offers in the future.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Coral Peach: Because, Damn it!", "Author": "Tiger \"Tigercaron\"", "ReviewID": "R2OGQT0N4Z9XW2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Well yes! I made fun of the new HP Chromebook 14 (in Coral Peach, Turquoise and Snow White) when I first saw it.

HP is known for it\u2019s build quality and the HP Chromebook 14 doesn\u2019t disappoint: excellent quality keyboard, speakers and an array of side port options such as two USB 3.0 and one USB 2.0 an HDMI port and an SD card slot for additional memory - Google take note!

Rarely is there problem opening any site - once a site was very slow opening and I got a message on the chromebook asking if I wanted to wait or to kill it.

You can download web apps, but tablet or Android apps from Google Play will not work.All that being said, every Chromebook will have those limitations, not just this one. There are some huge benefits to the idea of a Chromebook, too. I'm coming to this laptop after having a MacBook for five years and refusing to get a PC, and it feels very similar to me. The operating system runs very smoothly and is not clunky in any way, and I love it. It's very easy to set up and figure out how to use. Everything you do is backed up to the Google Cloud, so you can access everything anywhere.If you fully understand what a Chromebook is and that it is NOT an adequate replacement for a laptop if you regularly use anything other than a web browser and word processing, I would highly recommend this one. It's fast, it's light, the screen resolution is great, and it has a much larger screen than many other Chromebooks. The color is really quite pretty, and the soft finish feels great. It also seems to pick up WiFi connections from further away than my old laptop, and I have not had any major issues with pages not loading or videos or video chats lagging. The speakers are on the bottom of the computer, which seems a little strange, but it makes things sound louder when the computer is on a hard surface. I've never felt that it doesn't play loud enough. There is a fan, unlike some other Chromebooks, so it doesn't run silently, but I definitely wouldn't call it loud.Finally, what sold me on this is that it came with two free years of T-Mobile 4g. I'm not sure if Amazon also offers this deal (I bought it in a store), but it's a great deal for the price.TLDR? If you need a full-blown laptop with the ability to install programs, this isn't for you. If all you need is a place for Facebook, reading news, taking notes in Google Docs and watching Hulu and Netflix, this is exactly what you're looking for, and it's a great buy.", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Shockingly Good Computer!", "Author": "R.

(Additional negative TWO notes added)", "Author": "Knightwind", "ReviewID": "R10HK88EFCFO25", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Second negative comment on this product:  It DOES NOT SUPPORT DIRECT PRINTING!!!!  How on earth could somebody create a laptop like computer that CANNOT PRINT!!!  To be fair, when I bought this machine, I had no intention of printing from it.  Rather when I need to do those kind of tasks, I do those on a Windows based PC.  But I had recommended this laptop to somebody, NOT REALIZING that they would need to print from it.  I had lauded only the features I had needed, and didn't even investigate something that ANYBODY in their right mind, would design into a laptop-like computer!  I just assumed it was there.  It's not.  Now Google has a \"work-a-round\" in that you can do \"cloud printing\".  That's assuming that you can make THAT work, because the person who is having this problem with their HP Chromebook is NOT able to get it to work, and so far NONE of the suggestions they have found offer a solution.  The ONLY way I have found to print from a HP Chromebook is to print to a PDF file.  At least they build that ability in.  Then I email the PDF file to a Windows based computer, and then print it.  I tested that, and it worked beautifully.  Considering that the HP Chromebook has an abundance of USB ports on it, surely they could supply at least a basic driver that would work with (hey, you specify which printers).Original review follows this additional update:I tried pairing the HP Chrome-book using it's blue tooth technology with a Bose blue tooth speaker.  First, I tested the Bose speaker using my iPod with a blue tooth transmitter on it.  The sound quality was quite good. The disappointment came when I tried using the blue tooth from the HP Chrome book. The music stored on the Chrome book plays, but at the beginning of each song, there is stuttering, and after a few seconds, it's like the systems finally catch up, and then mostly, it plays okay, but there are hiccups every so often. When I tried the Hangout function, placing a visual/audio call over the internet, the picture is about 1 to 3 seconds before the voice, which is very disconcerting. Yet, when I turn off the blue tooth on the Chrome book, the sound reverts back to the computers speakers, and then there is absolutely no delay. Conclusion for me is that the HP Chrome book has an issue with blue tooth, and it's simply not useable for conversations, and disappointing with music. Distance between the devices made no noticeable difference. It sounded about the same whether it was 3' or 15'. Because the Blue tooth does NOT work PROPERLY with the HP Chrome Book, I had to reduce my star rating from 5 to 4.  It's not a game changer, but it is disappointing that HP apparently did not test this feature properly.  I know my Blue Tooth speaker system is good, because it plays perfectly with an iPod using Blue tooth.  (ADDENDUM:  The Chrome Book and the Bose speaker work PERFECTLY WITH A CABLE.  HP might as not have bothered putting Blue Tooth on this Chrome Book.  It is flawed.)Original Review:I ended up not ordering this from Amazon because Amazon did not directly stock it, and therefore I was worried at the terms and conditions of some of the third party vendors selling through Amazon, which give the distinct impression that if you don't buy the second year of support, that they are not responsible from the moment they ship it, if it gets damaged.  Therefore I bought it from a vendor I like and trust to cover a product if it gets damaged in shipment.That said, this is the best laptop (like) computer I have ever purchased, and I will NEVER, EVER buy a Windows based laptop again.  Period.  Now I can \"get away\" with this decision because I only use a laptop for web access and email, and nothing more.  I don't have the need for Windows compliant software.  Obviously, your needs may be different.Best thing I've experienced with this Chrome-book is the absolute SPEED!  I lift the lid, and the system is READY to go in 2 seconds, or less!  I do NOT have to worry and wait while that clunker Windows operating system takes up to 2-3 minutes to load.  I do NOT have to wait for Anti-virus software to verify it's up to date, and if it's not, wait possibly 10-15 minutes for it to update.  I so NOT have to wait to see Windows patches lining up for about 20 to 40 MINUTES of downloading, installing, re-booting.  All that stuff made me loath even turning on a Windows based laptop (and the one I WAS using had a fast hard drive in it, and had 4 GB of memory in it, along with the second fastest Intel CPU.All the applications on the Chrome-book run flawlessly.  No problems and the \"learning curve\" is very quick.I very highly recommend this device!!!!(a couple of minor points - (1) the USB 3 slots are quite stiff - you may have to push harder than you feel comfortable to get say, a memory stick, in there.  That said, I had no problem inserting a 32Gb mini-stick in there with all my music on it.  The file manager came up immediately, and I was able to use the folders I set up originally in Windows to get to my music.  Once you start playing a song in the folder, the system automatically continues playing other songs in the same folder.  (2) I like using a mouse, but I can see that using the touch pad is definitely smoother, and faster.  I'll probably use both for a while, and see how that shakes out.  The speed of the touch pad is far quicker than the mouse.  (3) Gmail is just like on a Windows based machine.  It works pretty well, once you get it set up the way you like it.  My only reservation was that on my Windows based system, I was using Microsoft Outlook, which can be set up to run with several email boxes (accounts), and automatically downloads all the boxes on a regular basis.  With Gmail,. you can only have one email account.  (4) The screen size - I went with the 14\" because I had experienced the Samsung Chrome book which is 11\" and I didn't like the small screen because my vision isn't that good.  However, even with 14\" screen, I was straining to read web pages.  The solution is to set the display at 125% and that boosts the print of most web pages to be read easily.)", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Initial thoughts", "Author": "M. Schmidt", "ReviewID": "RV7M359ANDDIU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is our 3rd Chrome OS device. Last year we purchased 2 Samsung Chrome OS devices for our daughters. I was drawn in by the concept of an OS that you didn't have to update or worry about virus software and making sure everything was up to date. We also have a mac and a HP laptop running windows 7. So I'm well familiar with the different operating systems and there strengths and weaknesses. I particularly have issues with windows OS. My wife and daughter were always calling me at work with problems or programs asking for permission to update. I'm not an IT wizzard and know enough to be dangerous...lol Anyway I found it frustrating for all of us. I can say thanks to the Chrome OS ALL of those issues have gone away! No calls on having problems booting up, no phone calls on programs asking permission to update. No phone calls on system warnings about viruses and other stuff.I think a good way to approach the Chrome OS is looking at it as a tool. Windows OS is a tool that I use at work. I have applications that I need to do my job. My mac is another tool that I use for recording music in my basement studio and it works great for that.  Chrome OS is a tool for doing pretty much everything you'd do online. Email, banking, social media, Netflixs, Google also has been busy with the help of developers in creating offline apps if you need to do simple photos edits or listen to MP3's type a document. This is where my wife and kids do 100% of their stuff so Chrome is perfect for them. Chrome is perfect for me typing this review in Amazon and I use it exclusively for everything I do outside of my music stuff.Okay enough about Chrome OS and onto the Chromebook 14. Moving to a 14\" screen is nice compared to the Samsung 11.6\" screen. I found the screen to be clear and easy to view. In Chrome style it boots super fast, under 10 seconds and unlike windows even after a years usage it's still just as fast. Compared to my other daughters laptop that takes close to 2 minutes now to boot. My mac has a SSD and boots in about 20 seconds consistently. I love the Chromebooks size. It's small and lightweight at 4 pounds compared to the other windows HP laptop we own. The battery life is really good again compared to the HP laptop running windows. I'd say it's easily double the battery life. It's been an enjoyable experience so far.There are a couple things to be aware of before you invest in a the Chrome operating system. Be aware that you can not connect directly to a printer via a usb cable. This isn't an issue for us because we have a wifi printer connected to our home network and can access the printer via google cloud printing. Works great and I haven't had any issues with this setup. The other issue may be input devices. I personally like using a track ball instead of the touch pad. So this is a drawback currently to Chrome OS. I'm hoping as the Chrome OS gains margins that MFG's will start supporting the OS with some of these input devices. It's not a deal breaker for me just a minor inconvenience. Other then that I've been very please to date with the Chromebook 14.If any major issues come up I'll update my review. To date I've been please with this product. Fast and easy to use, no updates just boot it up and go. Can't ask for anything better then that.

Veracity \"Mac Guy\"", "ReviewID": "RQTJWNXTFKFQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This review is intended for those who have a Macbook, but who are interested in getting a less expensive mobile machine they can use with ease, like a Mac, but without the worry of an expensive Macbook that could get lost or damaged.  At $349, the HP 14\u201d Chromebook is the perfect solution.The HP 14\u201d Chromebook also comes with 200MB of free 4G T-Mobile Data each month - for two years - not a lot of data, but if you\u2019re not at home or at a hotspot and need to check something out, this is a nice feature.Back to basics - The 4G 14\u201d HP Chromebook feels, looks, and acts a lot like a MacBook. In some respects it\u2019s even easier since the whole OS is the Chrome browser.  There are \u201csettings\u201d but they\u2019re pretty easy to figure out, so it\u2019s really quick to acclimate to the differences.The keyboard is excellent and the keys have a nice rubbery texture feel - a good thing, no complaints.  The trackpad is a bit wacky at times and it can indiscriminately click on something as you guide the cursor across the screen.  It also isn\u2019t perfect at highlighting, but it\u2019s not bad.  There are also some limited gestures - two finger swipe to the next page and two finger drag up and down.  I have also stumbled onto a \u201cCTRL - two finger swipe\u201d that enlarges and minimizes the onscreen display - kinda like the MacBook pinch and expand gesture.  It\u2019s very sensitive, but it works and I use it often.  DIdn\u2019t find any documentation on it btw, but it does work.The outside surface behind the monitor is a white matte finish (white on my machine) and there is a 1\u201d (or so) silver HP logo in the middle.  The matte finish is a bit shiny from the oil on fingertips.  I haven\u2019t tried cleaning it yet because I\u2019m a bit apprehensive on what would work best, but it\u2019s not really too noticeable except at an angle, so I\u2019m waiting.  I also like the white bezel around the screen and it has a small silver logo centered on the bottom edge.  The bezel also has a thin 1.5\u201d rubber bumper on each side and a long 12\u201d rubber bumper along the top with a the web cam mounted in the lid.  Going with the Google pastel colors, I have a high tech yellow bandage over the web cam, so no opinion re it\u2019s quality/use.  The screen itself is good from most angles, but I notice a \u201cnegative\u201d type image at extreme angles.  That said, I don\u2019t look at the screen at extreme angles, so it\u2019s not really a big deal unless I\u2019m trying to show someone something.  The area around the keyboard is silver, it looks like metal and feels good so although I can\u2019t imagine why it isn\u2019t white, but it is silver on all the models - wonder why? haha  The bottom of the laptop is a white textured rubbery coating and it still looks like new almost a month later, because there are four rubbery feet that lift it off the desk.The left side (back to front) has a Kingsington lock point, HDMI port, two USB ports, an audio in/out jack and an LED on light. On the right side are (back to front) power port (with a 90 degree angle plug), an SD Card slot, a USB port, and the 4G mini card slot (which came installed and preconfigured).  The bottom has nine screws and four rubbery feet. There are two audio \u201cslots\u201d and two perforated heat screens (molded into the body).Overall the laptop has a great feel, solid, and gives the impression of quality.The 4GB memory, which is only on the 4G model, also handles video/multiple windows without any noticeable impact (unlike the 2GB memory model I had before - an 11\u201d Samsung).When I first got the Chromebook, I was a little bit apprehensive about its capabilities and although it isn\u2019t a powerhorse like a MacBook, it is certainly capable of handling day to day needs and it has become a fast friend that filled a gap in my mobile needs.  My vision is much better suited to the 14\u201d screen and I like the real estate to spread out as well. I also don\u2019t like the portable keyboards used with tablets, so the full size keyboard of the Chromebook is a a big bonus as well.Google Chrome offers a \u201cdock\u201d along the bottom to position your favorite apps (I haven\u2019t figured out how to relocate it to the side or even if it can be).  A couple nice features about the browser are that you can click and drag a \u201ctab\u201d to create a new window and you can also drag a window to the side and it will auto-anchor it.  That last feature however, gets in the way sometimes if you\u2019re trying to set up two windows side by side. But, it\u2019s no big deal.AppsiCloud works well on the Chrome browser and I\u2019m also able to use the beta versions of iWork, although when I open those apps, I get a disclaimer that they may not be fully functional in my browser - none the less, they seem to work well.  iCloud mail, also works without any problems.The Chrome Web Store offers a lot of apps that, like the AppStore allows you to use them for free.  I don\u2019t even know if they have ANY that cost or at least I don\u2019t remember seeing any.  I originally thought the Android apps would work on a Chromebook, but it was just a misunderstanding - they do not.Before I close I also wanted to say that I also considered going to a full feature Windows machine, but I thought going to Chrome would be a lot easier than learning Windows 8 and that was a good decision. Along with the free software, automatic updates, and built in security with everything going through Google, Chrome OS is a great alternative to Windows, Chrome is easy to learn, no drilling down to get to settings, so even if you don\u2019t know where something is, it\u2019s not that far removed.  Overall Chrome OS is great and if you\u2019re looking for a second computer to supplement your Mac, join the Chrome cloud, I seriously doubt you would be disappointed, it\u2019s turned out to be a very nice computer.", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome computer for a very cheap price", "Author": "tedhiltonhead", "ReviewID": "R37TK4I0QA9MQI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this computer to replace my aging Macbook Pro.

It also has no sim card slot.My initial feelings are very positive. The size and weight feel just about perfect. Not too light/cheap feeling, but nicely weighted and portable. The keyboard is excellent. I'm \"upgrading\" from a Sony Vaio laptop and the keyboard feels very similar with just a bit of texture on the keys. Performance seems to be more than adequate, although I haven't tried to stress test it in any way yet. The Intel processor runs cool. I've only heard the fans spin up once for a minute or two, otherwise they run slowly and quietly. Battery life has been excellent. I have had to adjust to using the trackpad , but it seems to work fine. There are some settings you can change to customize it or there are plenty of USB slots if you'd rather use a mouse. Also of note, the laptop has Bluetooth built in.The screen seems to be the weakest feature. The positives are the size and the wide range of brightness settings. The screen can get very bright, but you can all set it very low and even completely off. The HDMI port allows for several display configurations. You can mirror the display, extend the desktop, and set the external monitor to be your primary display. On the not so nice side is the resolution. 1366 x 768 on a 14\" screen is usable, but not ideal. A 1440 x 900 screen would have made me give it that fifth star.My main gripe with the Chromebook, and from what I'm reading it maybe a Chrome OS issue, is the color temperature of the screen. The screen is clearly skewed too far in the \"cool blue\" color spectrum. I did some searching online and have found other people, using other Chromebooks, complaining about this as well. From what I can tell there is currently no fix or adjustments available. If you are into photography, like I am, be warned that the screen does not accurately reproduce colors like an Apple or Sony display.Overall I'm happy with the purchase.

It's also shiny and nice, you just *want* to use it - my macbook pro is sitting in my backpack right now and will probably stay there until I have to edit my demo reel.Other stuff:The Google cloud situation really comes together nicely in Chromebook. All the usual google apps are now little icons in the \"start\" menu. User accounts are easy to manage and there's something quite lovely about having your preferences being loaded up onto your computer - it's essentially the same as using Chrome anywhere, but on the Chromebook it feels integrated. Also a nice touch - there's a local folder called \"google drive\" which syncs with the online google drive just like Dropbox.So far it's staying cool. I know there's not a lot of heavy lifting, but it's nice to have a laptop I can put on my lap (unlike my macbook pro). Battery also seems to last quite long though the hour estimates are wonking between 8.5 and 10 hrs at the moment.Network jazz is easy to deal with.

I have used my HP Chromebook 14 for almost a week now and I think I am really going to like this notebook the more I use it but there are a couple of things that nag at me ever so slightly.First, the RAM in the computer is not upgradeable. The models I purchased had two gigs of RAM in them and those modules are soldered on to the motherboard. This means no upgrading done by me down the road. I cannot complain a lot because the chromebooks only cost $300 but it was something that I wish I could do in order to increase the lifespan of these guys. On that note, the battery is not replaceable by the user either. Not a deal breaker but something to keep in mind if you are like me and like to be able to maintain your hardware as it ages.On the upside, I really enjoy the bigger screen the HP Chromebook 14 has to offer. So many Chromebooks have tiny screens, which is great on battery life but make it hard to use as your primary computer when you have a lot of tabs open and like to multitask like I do. I am also a huge fan of the keyboard. Again, Chromebooks tend to have rather cheap keyboards but the key presses on this model are crisp and typing is rather enjoyable. Typing isn't quite as enjoyable as it may be on my Macbook Pro or a mechanical keyboard but for the price of this unit, I don't expect it to be. I do enjoy typing on this notebook much more than I thought I would.Lastly, I really like the finish on the outer shell of the Chromebook. The white looks nice and the finish is a little bit grippy. It makes the notebook feel and look like a higher quality build than it most likely is. Obviously, this doesn't impact the utility of this computer but looks never hurt either.Also, while this doesn't apply to the \"snow white\" color scheme, if you are interested in the \"peach corral\" color, be warned it is very pinkish. Obnoxiously so. It looks much more red in pictures but when you see it in person, it is a hard color to look at. The blue-ish color scheme also doesn't look the same in person as it does in pictures. It is more of a turquoise and less of a green. Just thought I would mention this in case potential buyers are looking at the other colors. I bought a few of each color and the white is definitely the more polished and professional looking of the three colors available for this specific model.Like I said, my initial impression of this Chromebook is that it is a nice machine and it is probably the first Chromebook I could see as a viable replacement for a Windows or OS X based machine.

I didn't need a fully-loaded Macbook (neither could I afford one), since I could still use iTunes on my desktop when needed.

It fits all my needs and more, and is very easy and convenient to take to school and back.  It turns on in seconds and holds a full charge for about 7-8 hours.

I did not want to deal with trying to teach my kids about Windows split personality (Metro side vs. desktop side). At school, the kids use MacBook Airs but these are out of our price range. So, for a replacement, I wanted a reasonably priced solution, good performance, intuitive interface, and something that required minimal maintenance. The HP Chromebook (we bought one with 4GB RAM, 32 GB SSD) has more than met my expectations. The screen size is perfect and the Chromebook meets all of my kids needs. My daughter is thrilled with how fast it boots up. The kids use Google Drive for all their academic needs, listen to music on Pandora/Spotify, have apps for photo and video editing, and found games they like. My son plays Minecraft and this does NOT work on the Chromebook so he uses my Windows 8 machine for this.Overall, our family loves the HP Chromebook 14. As a reminder, you cannot run Windows apps.

Plus, I already used some key Google services (Chrome, Gmail and Calendar) so I thought it might be worth a shot to see how they operated on Chrome OS since in my experience software generally runs best on it\u2019s native OS if created by the same developer (i.e. iTunes on Mac OS X and Microsoft Office on Windows). I've had this Chromebook for a week now and have had the opportunity to test it as thoroughly as I can based on the things I use laptops for. Below are the observations I made while using it and I separated everything into categories for quicker viewing depending on your needs. Before I get started I want to emphasize that you should use the Get Started app that Google provides and/or do searches online if you get stumped. If you don\u2019t, then you will get frustrated and just want to get rid of it. A few times I said this OS sucked but after researching it I was able to figure out how to accomplish my task at hand by reading directions, imagine that!Media Files: On day one I tested it by watching numerous mp4 files I had stored on an SD card. I popped the card in (which does not stick out from the side of the machine) and the file browser popped up. I double clicked the m4v file and the media player that is built into the OS started playing the file. I also tried some music files I had stored on a USB drive and it worked the same way with the file browser opening up and the built in player launching upon double clicking the file. I have my music collection encoding using iTunes so they are AAC m4a files, which confirms Google\u2019s claims that these file types are supported. iTunes users should feel comfortable migrating to this environment. See this page for other supported media types: [...]Microsoft Office: It appears that Google is trying to cover all their bases with \"basic\" tasks by including Google Docs, Spreadsheets and Slides as Microsoft Office alternatives and with a little time learning the interfaces you should be able to do all the basic functions in these apps. There is also an offline option to work on your files without an internet connection which worked fine but I quickly found out that documents can be edited but spreadsheets are \u201cview only\u201d when offline. This is something that Google needs to work on ASAP because if I didn\u2019t have a mobile hotspot this alone would be reason enough for me to return/sell it. So, if you don\u2019t always have an internet connection and use spreadsheets a lot then this device and OS is not for you. I also installed SkyDrive which allowed me to edit Microsoft files in their web-apps, which look like the paid software versions but within a web browser. They too have limited functionality like the Google apps but you would be able to find things quicker if you are used to those user interfaces but you do lose the offline editing capabilities that Google provides you through their alternatives (though they aren\u2019t perfect as I already mentioned). Google Keep is also offered and it is like Notes in Mac OS X or Notepad in Windows so you do have something for quick note taking and this works perfectly offline. I don\u2019t use slide presentations so I can\u2019t comment on that program.Apps: I feel a lot of these are unnecessary because most of the ones I've installed simply direct you straight to the homepage of that website just as if you clicked one of your bookmarks in your Bookmarks Bar. One advantage I see to this though as I used it more is that you can pin more of these apps to your Launcher Bar at the bottom of the screen than you could install on the Bookmarks Bar in your Chrome browser window. The apps also allow you to open them in a separate window which is nice if you don't want it to open in another browser tab and/or cluttering up the Chrome browser. Also, hardly any of them are redesigned in any way like you are used to seeing apps on smart phones. The ones that were built differently I felt just didn't work as well as the full site so I just ended up typing the internet address in the Chrome browser and removed the app. One thing that I liked that are present in Google apps on other OS\u2019s that I saw was missing here was the speech input. On iPad I like speaking things I want to search for and that wasn\u2019t an option in the Google Chrome or Google Search apps on this machine. I do see a microphone above the screen so I know it\u2019s capable of hearing my voice, so hopefully this is something they add soon.Hardware: The build quality of this machine is one of the best I've seen at this price point! I find it visually appealing with the selection of colors they used (my model was silver/white) and the keyboard tray reminds me of a Mac wireless keyboard. This color combination also makes it impossible to see fingerprints. The soft touch material being used for the outer body of this laptop feels nice to the hands. It can take a beating too apparently because I already bumped it against something pretty hard by accident and it didn\u2019t show a mark at all! Nice job HP! This device is also very thin and is competing with ultrabooks in terms of size, in fact it looks almost identical to the sleekbook/ultrabook offerings from HP. The device also has a nice selection of ports providing USB 2.0, USB 3.0, full size HDMI, SD card reader, headphone/microphone combo jack, Kensington lock slot and an indicator light for sleep/use.Screen: I did notice while watching videos that I had to adjust the screen angle a couple of times to get the perfect viewing angle (mostly for dark blacks). Clearly this is not an IPS display, but for $300 I guess you can't expect to get a 1080p IPS display. It feels very solid and doesn\u2019t flex very much when I tried to bend the screen from side-to-side. The screen is also very thin and after applying pressure to the back of the panel to see if it would show through I glad to say nothing showed unless you were applying A LOT of pressure, which I\u2019m sure most users won\u2019t. I was a little disappointed to see that the backlit chrome bar present on the lid of HP 11 and Pixel was missing here. I think adding this would make a nice additional design element.Keyboard: It doesn't have much key travel but if you can train yourself to type softer then you should be able to adjust and make it a good typing experience (with devices becoming thinner this is just something we will have to make adjustments for). Also, the keyboard tray is solid and does not flex or trampoline at all. Some back-lit keys would be a nice addition in future models since ambient lighting isn't the greatest in most rooms I\u2019ve used this in but the grey lettering on white keys helps to combat that a little bit. I love most of the shortcuts at the top of the keyboard such as the full screen, volume adjustments and display brightness keys but the back/forward aren't necessary with trackpad gestures and anyone used to using alt+tab to switch through apps won\u2019t use the app switching key. I feel one, if not all, of these could be removed and shift the row left so we can have a dedicated DELETE key (holding alt+backspace isn\u2019t quite as intuitive for people coming from Windows). See this site for keyboard shortcuts: [...]Trackpad: I was shocked at how the trackpad had a silky smooth texture to it which reminded me of a Macbook because my finger rarely skips across the surface. I love the addition of trackpad gestures and use tap-to-click, back/forward and scrolling all the time. The clickpad is only clickable on the bottom half of the trackpad and gets easier to push down the closer to the bottom of the trackpad you get. A full clickpad might be a nice change in future models.Hinge: The hinge to open the lid isn't as stiff as you find on 90% of laptops today which require two hands to pry open, however you still can't open it with one hand. Hopefully with more use the hinge will loosen a little more since one unit I tested in a store before I made the purchase seemed to be a little looser than the one on my unit. I personally love laptops that you don't have to pry open with two hands and this is about halfway there. I think if they put the hinge from the HP Chromebook 11 on this then they would have nailed it. I also decided to grab the laptop by the lid and shook it around to test how strong the hinge was and it didn\u2019t give very much at all so I\u2019m confident that it\u2019s a solid build and won\u2019t break anytime soon if ever.Accessories: I like that the power adapter is smaller than we are used to seeing with traditional laptops but at the same time I feel power bricks have become outdated and need to be more like tablet chargers having folding prongs built in to a cube shaped adapter versus having a cord going in and coming out of a power brick.Performance: So far from my testing the performance has been great. I wouldn\u2019t think that using an Intel Celeron laptop would be something that I would brag about but I haven\u2019t had any issues with things getting hung up or freezing. I\u2019m not even sure why Google made the Pixel with an i5 processor because after using this I really don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s necessary (unless it\u2019s for gaming which is something I don\u2019t do on laptops). Web pages load pretty fast on my home network which is running on an ac router and I don\u2019t experience any lag as I scroll down from loading images. Refreshing the laptop internals to have wireless ac built-in would be a nice addition in future models.Battery: Installed is a 4 cell battery and checking the HP website results in a 9.5 hour claim. After using it for a week and monitoring usage very closely here is what I found. I was able to get 4 days of use out of it before having to plug it in and combined use time was 7 hours. However, 1.75 hours of this was watching videos so battery life could have been better if just used for web browsing and document editing only. In fact, looking at my results and doing some simple math, I\u2019m confident 9.5 hours is an accurate claim. For once HP isn\u2019t exaggerating battery life claims! The Intel Celeron processor doesn\u2019t appear to be built for extended video playback though because after watching 1.75 hours of files from a USB drive I lost 30%! So, doing the math this machine should be able to last close to 6 hours for viewing back-to-back movies if you are on a long car ride or flight. Not that impressive when compared to tablets but having files stored internally might produce better results. All these findings were obtained with active wi-fi and brightness set to 50% the whole time. Using the sleep feature by closing the lid or using the \u201cshut down\u201d feature in the bottom right of the screen or holding the power button seemed to produce the same drainage result. I found that after a combined sleep time of 75 hours I only lost 5% of battery life. I\u2019d say that\u2019s pretty impressive compared to Windows machines and leaves more battery for use! Charging time from 5% took exactly 2 hours to fully charge back to 100% which is great since my cell phone charges about that quick and I consider that to be the industry standard.Conclusion: Overall I am pleased with the device but $300 might still be a little high for something that only serves as an internet browsing machine since the spreadsheet editing isn\u2019t where I\u2019d like it to be for offline use. I will probably let this device go for sale on eBay though because I don\u2019t need a third internet browsing device in my house. It simply doesn\u2019t outperform my iPad because the iWorks suite has more offline functionality on-the-go and the battery life of this machine comes up a little short. For fully functional software I will continue to rely on my home PC. HP should allow add-ons or upgrades on their website for a backlit keyboard, wireless ac, IPS display and a tablet adapter (if they can develop one). As for Chrome OS, add the option of editing spreadsheets offline and I\u2019ll give your OS another shot.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Chomebooks are the way to go", "Author": "Bill Cook", "ReviewID": "R1PBLBNISV0XOD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a good solid performing machine.

I have decades worth of research to compile and incorporate so it made sense that I needed a computer compatible with my Microsoft word files. WRONG!  That machine was a true pain.

But before she will receive it I had to see firsthand how is to be on a Chromebook, is it enough for me? And, to my surprise, yes, this is enough for everything I do at home, which is basically leisure/entertainment. So, in the following review I'll put emphasis mostly on the things other people reviews didn't cover well.First, for people complaining about \"ONLY\" 16GB of SSD storage, you have an SD card slot that can accommodate SDHC and SDXC cards. I bought a Sony 64GB SDXC Class 10 UHS-1 R40 Memory Card which is perfectly functional and very fast. SDXC cards can go up to 256GB in storage so you can have plenty of space in case you want to have lots of movies/music/pictures/documents available offline.The screen is very good if you don't want to share the content with other people who may not have the best viewing experience if they see it from sides.You have an HDMI port so you can see the screen on a big monitor (unlike the 11\" version of this Chromebook).Trackpad use is almost the same as the one from the macbook air  (pinching for zooming in and out is missing on the Chromie trackpad).I was very interested to explore the Chromebook concept and see how many things I can do online in the Chrome browser environment (of course you do not need a chromebook for that). The reason I write this is that a Chromebook is as good as the apps which are available for your needs. So here is my conclusion:In Google drive you can create documents, excel spreadsheets and presentations which are available offline. The complexity of the programs doesn't compare with Microsoft Office but can cover 99% of your needs. And this software is developing continuously.Reading ebooks: you can find apps for reading in the ePub format (see Readium, Magic Scroll and others). If you bought a Kindle book then you can use Cloud Reader to open it. But if you have .mobi, .lit and other eBooks in your personal library you'll have to convert them to the ePub format with an online file converter (check online-convert.com, which can convert any kind of file from one format to any other format, this is very important to know when using a Chromebook at this stage).Picture editing: use Pixlr Editing, but for a more professional app you can use Gimp 2.8, the free equivalent of Photoshop, and it runs in a Chrome browser (basically it opens in a new browser window so when it's opened it looks like the installed software on Macs or PCs).You can find sites online that let you edit your videos, same for editing sound if you need that. Chromebook can not open videos in wmv format but you can convert them to .mov, .avi or other compatible formats (see above, converter).Use Google Hangouts instead of Skype (If you want to use Skype (or VLC) you can install Linux in a chroot environment (Crouton), but this defies the purpose of using a Chromebook in terms of security, you have to let go old habits...).Now, can I use a ChromeBook for my professional work? Absolutely not! But as soon as I'm home, after a while, I forget I am on a Chromebook and not on my Macbook air (I didn't reach for this one for 4 days but I like it better because is lighter, well... for a price...).Remember that Chromebook is a concept that evolves in time, it's designed to get better, faster, more comprehensive and more secure as time passes. I am very impressed with what it can do today but you can only imagine what the possibilities are in a not so far away future.PS Does Microsoft have reasons to fear Google Chromebooks and Chrome OS?

HP did a great job with this device.  The picture and sound quality are both great, while watching Netflix and stuff from my PLEX server over WiFi.  I haven't ran into any issues (yet) connecting to different WiFi protocols.For me, I made a recovery thumbdrive for cOS (chrome://imageburner from inside cOS) and wiped it completely, and put Ubuntu 13.10 on it.

My 9 yr old son likes to use the computer for the games. We were constantly at war trying to coordinate my work and his play time. I purchased a HP Windows 8 laptop from Groupon and disliked it so much I ended up selling on Amazon.com. I was reluctant to purchase another Windows 8 (not a fan of Windows 8) but wasn't ready to drop $1200+ on a Mac when all we need was a reliable way to access the Internet if our desktop was in use (by me of course). We definitely needed a secondary computer but without the thrills and frills of a Mac and more user friendly for my two boys. This definitely fit the bill. It was super easy to setup and the speed is equal if not better than our desktop. The one major downfall for us is that you will not be able to play Minecraft which is huge in our house otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. For us it works out great and the price can't be beat. I actually purchased from Walmart.com to take advantage of the FREE 2-yr T-Mobile data plan so if we need to take this with us and there's no available Wifi we now have a backup alternative. I love the feel of the Chromebook rather than the bulky and heavy laptop of our previous HP. This is extremely light in comparison and has the feel of having a Mac but without the hefty price tag. I am extremely ecstatic with this purchase and would urge anyone else who is looking for a laptop with simplicity and ease, this is for sure what you will want. Just keep in mind that it does not support Minecraft though there are blogs with instructions of running Linux but I'm not tech savvy to take that chance.

I've not noticed any slowdown with lots of tabs open probably thanks to the CPU and 4GB of RAM. It boots from cold in 7 seconds and wakes from sleep instantly.I run 2X client along side the chrome browser to allow me to RDP to my work windows laptop and again all runs very fast. Scrolling is smooth and the track pad is the best I have used aside from the glass one on my old macbook pro, it supports 2 finger gestures for scrolling and going back and 3 fingers to switch chrome tabs.You can do your offline work on google docs and if you prefer to use word you can use office online as well (no offline mode for office though) It will play music and videos off line, I have some media on an SD card and you can just click them to play the videos, no connection needed.Battery life is great, I get a full day on a charge, with screen at 75% it lasts easily 8+ hours.The worse part is the display, it could do with being brighter and the viewing angles are not great, still ok but not great, the whites can also look a bit yellow at lower brightness settings.But Screen aside this is a great machine, very fast, very simple, and once you move all your data to google drive its so easy, I downloaded music manager on my PC and it uploaded all my itunes to google music so can be accessed from any PC, Mac, phone.If it could be improved I would prefer a slightly smaller screen, maybe the new toshiba 13.3, but when I bought this no one had a toshiba to review or had them in stock to look and touch, you had to buy online.Printing is easy you simply download google cloud print on your Windows machine and it adds your local printer as a cloud printer you can then send any docs to it even it the PC is off, it will just print them next time its online.I will need a Windows PC for some apps, such as Photoshop and a few other programs for which there is no alternative, but I often just connect to it remotely from my Chromebook.I sold my Windows 7 laptop and Surface RT and bought this, and I'm not disappointed one bit, i'm actually very impressed.", "Date": "February 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "This is all the computer that most people need.", "Author": "butters", "ReviewID": "R1RPMAQ14AMJRB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this for my mother in law when she moved across the country.

I just wish that it could run Skype. We were a little bummed when we realized that we couldn't Skype (this is why we bought it), so we all had to sign up for Google Hangouts so we can video call with my mother in law.

I was definitely nervous about buying a Chromebook-- I was worried about not being able to install programs like iTunes, Photoshop, or Microsoft Office.After a lot of research, I settled on the HP Chromebook 14. Big caveat here that I went to a brick-and-mortar store to buy the version with 4 GB memory.  The version I bought also came with 24 months of free T-mobile internet (only 200 mb per month free).I have not been disappointed.  This thing is very fast and plays HD video great. The battery life is also superb... I don't even worry about plugging it in most of the time 'cause I think the battery easily lasts for six hours, maybe longer, doing basic web surfing.  I have had no problems with Netflix, Pandora, or watching ESPN, etc.  The free T-mobile internet wasn't much (200 mb per month) but was a nice inclusion, as it didn't require a credit card or contract or any personal info to activate, and I can now surf the web at the airport, coffee shop, etc. if the wi-fi isn't free.  You'll burn through it in no time if you try to watch video, but it's nice for checking your email or light web surfing on the go.  Also, you can purchase additional data from T-Mobile once you use up the monthly allotment.I wouldn't buy this if you absolutely need iTunes or Microsoft Office... I've been doing all right with Google Music and Google Docs.  You get a ton of free Google Drive storage space to stash all your documents.  It's also got a card slot if you really feel the need to carry a ton of files around with you.  I bought a 64 GB card but I haven't really been using it for anything, to be honest.My only complaint so far: When this Chromebook is plugged into several of the power outlets at my girlfriend's apartment, the touchpad stops working.  It'll work fine again once it's unplugged.  This has only happened so far at this one apartment.

First I want it to turn on quickly and let me get working right away.  Second I want a great screen and keyboard.  Third I want it to be light and portable.  And finally I want it to be special.For the price this laptop combined with the ingenious Chrome operating system does the first two points really well.  It boots in three seconds and has a solid six hour battery life.  I just entered my gmail account and it imported my chrome bookmarks and I was literally ready to start using it in seconds.  No need to buy MS Office or virus software, everything comes in the box. Unlike my Samsung Ultrabook which still wants to reboot every week and seems to need half an hour to update the operating system and virus every time I use it, this machine is very functional.  HP did a good job with the hardware.  It is solid and well built.  The screen is bright and the keyboard is very functional.  It also comes with a full sized HDMI port, two USB and a SD card reader and decent built in speakers.So for the other two points. It is not as compact as I would like.  It is neither as thin nor as light as my Samsung Ultrabook (but it did cost about 10x less).  And it uses an old school charger with the brick sized capacitor.  I just hate those things (and they start to negate the portability factor).Is it special or fun?  No.  At least not yet.

Buyer beware the firmware of this machine, as mentioned in other reviews, is the Chrome Operating System using the Chrome browser. You cannot install executables or apps from outside the Google eco-system just like iPads and iTunes are married with the Apple app store. You cannot later install Windows, or any other OS, or executables outside of the Google eco-system.I cannot get the DishNetwork's DISHANYWHERE.COM sling activeX plugin (extension its called in Chrome) so that's a minor setback. The plugin only exists for the Windows or Mac operating systems, not the Chrome OS. Slingbox has a Facebook app that is supposed to work in the Chrome OS that I haven't finished futzing with to say whether it works or not. The way I made it work is use Chrome remote desktop on a PC in the Chrome browser that's already been set up to work with DISHANYWHERE (Before you try a remote desktop to it). Make sure your audio is set to simple stereo using the control panel or there will be no audio sent to the Chromebook remote desktop. Surround = zero sound.) Establish the remote desktop on the Chromebook to the PC running Chrome and remote desktop. Choppy, but better than no access to the DVR (live or recorded) content.If your machine auto-updates (as they all are firmware set to do) and will suddenly not let you logon ever, CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+R, induces a \"wipeout\" back to firmware Chrome OS as installed at HP. The automatic updating after that worked for me. You will lose EVERYTHING that you put in the machine with this.Audio on the HDMI port can only be heard if your load (HDTV) has audio output. A 720p or 1080p HDMI monitor with NO AUDIO decoding capability means you have no audio at any time.

It finally said \"Your pictures have loaded,\" yet they're nowhere to be found.  I've tried multiple pathways, too (e.g. loading them from my desktop straight to the cloud, loading them onto drive versus pictures, etc...).  A google search revealed that, indeed, this is a common and inexcusable problem.

While this keeps the Chromebook ALWAYS backed up with the user's Google Drive it can also limit portability to areas with WiFi, any prospective buyer needs to keep this in mind.Quick Hardware overview:The keyboard and trackpad are both fairly well built and are easy to use for typing long papers or doing research projects. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same thing about the screen, which, while bright, suffers from horribly poor viewing angles that makes it impossible to share the notebook with a friend or colleague and is only suitable for the direct user. The lid is covered in a pleasing soft touch finish while the bottom is textured plastic, both side make the computer easy to hold. The hold and general transporting are made even easier by the notebook's general light weight. You will not find an optical drive here (Chrome OS does not support CD/DVD/Blu-Ray drives) but there are plenty of full sized USB ports and even a full-sized HDMI out.A Chromebook is designed for two things and two things only: light work such as word processing, making a quick spread sheet, or making a short presentation, and surfing the web.

I paid $349.99 for the T-Mobile 200 Mb of FREE Data for life. Chromebook setup was super fast and easy. I find it's better sometimes to spend the extra money to buy it new and direct to ensure no hassles or problems.PROS:Start-up time: Roughly 5 secondsShut-down time: Near Instant (1-2 seconds)Feels solidly builtSmooth Transitioning between Chrome Tabs, Chrome Apps, etc. - Chrome runs smoother and quicker than on a Windows machine.Web Browsing seems spiffy and slick.The 14\" inch is just big enough for my HUGE HANDS and still feels comfortable.VERY quiet and does not get hot at all, even when my pants block the ventilation holes.Chromebook has a setup guide that shows you all the tricks and tips as far as shortcuts and utilizing the touch-pad.There is NO RIGHT CLICK BUT you can use TWO fingers on the touch-pad to perform a right click where ever you need to, very convenient and I find it works quicker than right clicking.UPDATES are incredible. Compared to normal Windows updates, the Chromebook will restart to complete updates in nearly 5-6 seconds. So nice not having to wait to \"CONFIGURE WINDOWS UPDATES\" which can take centuries to finish and I've had crash before. This Chromebook is sweet and simple.Before you give Chromebooks a \"bad\" review. Please do your research before hand and understand what you're buying. I did my research as far as replacement apps, determining my usage and examining all the features of a Chromebook. I'm a bigger guy so I purchased the 14\" over the smaller Chromebooks, otherwise it would be too small to type on.CONS: None so far. It's not windows and I knew that before buying it. If there had to be a CON - it would be that it looks like a MAC lolOverall: Very pleased with my purchase. I will definitely look into additional Chromebooks and the Chromebox as well.

It auto-saves everything for me so I never lose work, auto-syncs with my account so the same document matches in all the places where it's saved, and I can access it from any computer.If I have anything negative to say, it's that there are still programs out there that are not compatible with the Chrome OS operating system.

It breezes right through my day-to-day tasks on the web, use of documents, photo editing, socializing, etc.As with any system, you'll want to tweak it to your liking.  I'm only moderately tech-savvy, but it's still been easy with (frequently free) apps and extensions from the chrome store.  So far, I've had no problem finding everything I need.  I've found games, productivity and social apps and extensions of all stripes.  Integration with Chrome on my android phone, tablet and Chromecast has been seamless!  I love being able to move from one device to another without missing a beat.  Want to double check that Google search you did earlier?  Grab your phone with the Chrome browser installed and you can pull that exact search tab right up.  Casting content to the Chromecast is a great bonus, too.  I also love the cloud integration.  I can automatically upload pictures from my phone, documents from the Chromebook, etc. right to my Google drive.  Again, it's all seamless.After using my Chromebook daily for a few weeks, I've only run into one instance where I missed Java - one of the common critiques of Chromebooks.  I tried to print a coupon that I didn't notice was java-based and, of course, couldn't.  Fortunately, fewer and fewer things require Java, so it's really not a big problem.  And since Java is such a security risk, I'm *really* not sorry.The only thing I'm taking a while to adjust to are the keyboard shortcuts you can/must use with Chrome.  Some are just convenient alternatives, but some are the only means to access a feature, like caps lock unless you customize the keyboard settings.  I highly recommend doing that.  Eventually the ol' brain will catch on to the new aspects, but until then, the help app is just a click away.This is the first time I've worked with Chrome as an OS and it's been easy and pleasant.  This is not the only computer in the house, so on the odd chance I need access to something on a disc or really need to use Java, I do have an alternative.

The battery life is surprisingly really good. I watch a lot of videos (Netflix and Hulu) on this machine, and a full battery lasts over 9 hours for me. The screen is also an HD screen, and the quality is good. Movies, and shows look great on it.

I was worried that a homework laptop would be a much unappreciated gift.  But I was totally wrong.First, these are very attractive, although somewhat heavy, machines.  Everyone has adopted the Fruit Company sleek look and this 14\" Chromebook is no exception.  It is longer and wider and thicker than other systems, but it is a beautiful 14-inch display.  With the Haswell processor, my sons played much of the day and one used 25% of the battery and the other used 50%.  They had to break for meals, after all.Second, I think they had their systems updated and online in five minutes and said, \"Hey, Dad!  It already has Flash installed!\" and they were obviously on Adventure Quest World and not the Mathletics site that parents hope will draw the kids.  Five minutes later they knew that if they reduced screen resolution the game sped up and was very playable.Third, I had them test the sites that host their homework and all worked fine.  They were able to login and do the homework exercises without incident, get them bookmarked and back to gameplay in short order.  Only once or twice did they go back to their dedicated gaming desktops to do something on Steam or somewhere else.Finally, as they were forced to bed to sleep they rated the Chromebook as their best gift and that it made for a great Christmas.  I highly recommend these to anyone as an alternative to a \"real\" laptop.That said, I'm not sure about the Google Plus environment.  We created accounts for each boy and for me, connected our Family Circle, but I find all the clutter of Hangouts and related Apps you need of iPad or other systems to be totally confusing and unintegrated.  I have yet to get a shot at much time on the Chromebooks, but if things work better there that gives me hope, but for cross-device families I think the experience is a challenge.Oh, my final purchase decision was the under-$300 pricing of this at the time.  Although it was out of stock, I felt I was early enough to get the orders fulfilled by Christmas and they were.  IN spite of my appreciation for this system, it's solid 5GHz Wi-Fi support and its excellent Chrome browsing experience, I think $300 is my current limit for a device with Chromebook limitations.  Yes, I agree with the advantages (light OS maintenance, decent system security, etc) but I still feel this need to have local apps for when the network isn't there.I'll try to update this review over the next three months as we get more experience with these but after one day they are a major hit.One note, the Coral Red color looks like the faded paint on a 1970's import car that was parked in the sun for 40 years.

(By comparison, the faults of Apple systems, annoying as they are, are usually interpretable from some marketing perspective.)The HP chromebook 14 goes one better, sporting TWO fatal flaws.  The first is the CPU fan.  It's always on, and emits a maddening high-pitched whine through the bottom speaker grills, which I guess also function as heat vents.  Users whose hearing isn't sensitive to higher registers will find themselves untroubled.  The rest will live in a constant state of irritable tension as they chrome-browse the net.  This could have been so easily fixed early on in prototyping, but no, nobody at HP thought it worth the effort.The second fault is the screen.  Yes, it's 14 inches, awesome.  But it must be the cheapest, crappiest, darkest, most reflective, least visual-angle-y display on the market.Many will say: yes, true, the screen blows and the fan screeches.
