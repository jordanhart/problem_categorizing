{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great laptop after two day experience.", "Author": "J.P. Cain", "ReviewID": "R2S8BSJXAFXRPL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I actually want to give this laptop 4 1/2 stars, with the 1/2 star removed for combo of low rpm drive (standard on a lot of low to mid-range laptops) and casing that seems a little flimsy (I am used to sturdy Thinkpad case). Otherwise, this is a great laptop performance in both processor and graphics. I replaced the drive (I highly recommend you do this with at least a 7200 rpm hdd) with a Seagate Momentus XT hybrid hard drive so I can't speak much for the existing OS, but I did install all their add on drivers and I do like their wireless identifier at the login screen letting you know you are connected. The windows experience rated everything except my replaced hard drive with a 5.9, not bad at all for a sub-500 laptop!As for testing, I simultaneously backed up a dvd I owned while at the same time converted a movie iso image to an mkv. While the processor maxed out encoding at 27 fps(common enough in encoding) with dvd copy at 4 MB/s the memory stayed at a reasonable level (under half of system memory).  I also viewed several blu ray rips I had made from movies I own on my desktop and there was no stuttering or problem handling even the most visually stunning movie. I don't really play pc games so I can't review this, but I'm sure this can handle most 720p 1333x1768 game displays with no problem.I should also mention I did not pay Amazon's standard price (the factor that tipped me to buying this particular laptop) but even at that price point it beats out the other i3 laptops on the market (and perhaps even some current i5s due to fusion graphics)I bought this for my wife so hopefully she likes it as much as I do!", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice mid-range consumer laptop with a few annoying flaws", "Author": "William Hayden", "ReviewID": "R7OTIA8K1XURL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a sharp-looking, inexpensive laptop with decent CPU and GPU power for the price.  It has a few glaring shortcomings though, two of which are unfortunately major.Pros:1. Discrete ATI video card2. Bright screen3. Nice looking4. Perfectly adequate speed for any normal tasks5. HDMI outNeutral:1. 720P resolution is too low for a 15\" screen.  Unfortunately, this is nearly the standard on low- and mid-end 15\" laptops now, so Toshiba is no worse than most other manufacturers.Cons:1. There is no latch or magnet to hold the lid closed -- you just close it and hope it stays shut.  When you carry it, the lid tends to bang against the base of the laptop because there is typically a 1-2 mm gap between the lid and base due to the lack of any latching mechanism.  It does not feel solid and secure at all when carrying it.2. The screen has worst viewing angle and glare problem I have ever experienced on a laptop, hands down.  Granted, my last laptop was a MacBook Pro with a gorgeous IPS screen and cost 3x as much, but I was not prepared for how poor this TFT screen would be when used in even moderately bright indoor conditions, or in just about any lighting conditions when displaying dark images.3.  No backlit keyboard.  This is annoying when trying to use it in low-light conditions, but you can't call this a major flaw at this price point.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop", "Author": "Buckerou", "ReviewID": "R3PKHLI1LY9ENG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop from Amazon and have had it for 2 weeks. This is a relatively new model with a new cpu and a June 2011 release date. My previous laptop was a HP DV6165 - an AMD dual core running Windows XP. This laptop blows that one away in every aspect. It comes with a healthy 4 Gb of ram, which is not the max, but it runs Windows 7 very nicely. The WEI is a 5.8 and held back due to the 5400 rpm HD. I am sure with a SSD this laptop would scream. The cpu scores a 6.9 WEI. If you want to validate this, check out the CPU performance charts as a comparison. The AMD cpu in this scores right up there with Intel's I5's and B940's and literally blows away my one sons old Q6600 overclocked (passed down from dad) quad.My desktop is a Intel I-7 with a Crucial SSD hard drive. I have been running Raid arrays in my last three computers. So you can see, I do know a bit about performance. This laptop has got it. I have not tested it for games yet as my gaming rig has dual GTX460's so I probably won't be gaming on the laptop. I don't think you will be disappointed with this laptop. The software on it is not too overdone either. The case is a light gray with a block pattern in it. It is not as pretty as some but for the price it is well worth it.Edit 9/4/11: Just finished watching a movie while ironing some clothes. Played beautifully. To the guy with the gaming problem, there is a video update on the Toshiba website. This may fix your issue. I have not seen it with mine. Minimal games but no issues thus far! I really love mine and am very happy with it.  I did increase the ram to 8 Gb with a recent sale from a certain store, new egg for $35. Seems a bit snappier now but it was no slouch before it either.", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very nice and affordable computer that's up-to-date!", "Author": "AJ Nelson", "ReviewID": "R1UZ821WJOGG1C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my computer, it's awesome. It connects to the internet extremely well, it is easy to work, and it is super fast! I think that the only problem I have with it is that it's constantly downloading updates, but it is still fairly new, so that makes sense. It's very light and compact, and you can take it practically anywhere. The base doesn't get very warm either, so it won't burn you if you have it sitting on your lap. It's very functional, and everything that I've put on it works great. So if you're looking for a really nice laptop that's relatively cheap, this is the one!!", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Toshiba Satellite L755,", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1O2YWLBQU9O7R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recieved my laptop on 21 Aug from Amazon.  Its a beauty, simply turned it on, set up the wi-fi and I was away laughing.  The performance is fantastic as was the purchase  price.  I live in NZ and I have had no problems at all using my laptop here.  The same item cost 4 times the price of the Amazon deal (shipping and import costs included). So this purchase represented great value.I mostloy surf the net and do a bit of consulting on the side.  This laptop is exactly right for the job.  Ideal in fact.  Highly recommended.", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good for gaming", "Author": "SD", "ReviewID": "R1NEOCDZ4CSTZ5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop mainly for gaming. So far the graphics card has been nothing short of amazing although at times, when i'm playing games, it randomly minimizes and shows the desktop. Not sure if this has to do with the graphics card or if its a software problem but it really starts to bother you in no time. Also when I bought this, they had a promotion that I would receive a free copy of \"Dirt 3\" when I purchased the laptop and I got an email with the activation code to the game but the code does not work. I contacted Steam (the company that provides the game) and they told me the code was invalid. Just something to keep in mind if you were looking forward to that. All in all, pretty good laptop for gaming", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Toshiba L755D-S5279 is an excellent laptop", "Author": "N. J. Wojciak", "ReviewID": "R1EGWZNZXFZJC5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think this is an excellent laptop and the best value of any laptop available today.  However, the laptop has a few minor problems.  The speakers are weak.It's hard to hear music if there is much noise nearby.  I hooked up my old speakers which includes a large sub-woofer and now I can play music quite loud. External speakers though must have their own power source or they won't work.  .  There are NO recovery disks.  Before you download any updates (Microsoft downloaded FIFTY-NINE) do prepare recovery disks.  I bought a 16GB flashdrive instead of fooling with disks to copy 12GB of data.  The scroll pad is too sensitive in its default position. A slight touch of the pad and something may open you never intended, which is annoying.  Go to Toshiba Assist program then to mice and the sensitivity section.  I adjusted the slide to the halfway point and that resolved the problem.  The laptop's screen is too glossy. You have to find a place in your room to minimize reflections.  I bought a 23 inch monitor with a matte screen finish for my wife who has poor vision and that solved two problems for me.  The keyboard has a nice feel but the letters on the keys are a light shade of grey not bright white.  I already had a wireless keyboard and use it. If you have a keyboard with a USB cable attached it should work.  Incidentaly, Toshiba chat tech support is excellent.  \"Donna\" answered every question I threw at her quickly. I was very impressed having dealt with the hapless techs at Dell and Gateway. Toshiba Satellite L755D-S5279 15.6-Inch LED Laptop (Grey)", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Value", "Author": "B. J. Barney III \"Wheelzup\"", "ReviewID": "R25PZWJBG7ZRCG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the Toshiba Satellite L755D-S5279 for about a month now and it hasn't given me any trouble at all. It replaces an HP laptop that had more useless bells and whistles than you can shake a stick at. The Toshiba is faster than I thought it would be but I think it's because it uses an AMD Quad Core CPU and 4GB of DDR3 memory and AMD graphics. It does have the next generation LED LCD display. I had taken it camping and at first I had a hard time viewing the disply especially in bright sunlight. I simply turned away from the direct sunlight and that did the trick.  Another positive is the nice big keys on the keyboard plus it has the number pad making entering information a breeze. The keys are not soft like many laptops that I looked at before choosing this one. They feel very solid just like the entire laptop does. The battery life seems to be a little over 3 hours which isn't so bad considering it's being used for a little bit of everything including a couple of games running with everything turned up to maximum and watching DVD's though it can't run Blu-rays.  The only thing that I noticed that's not so hot is a couple of dead pixels but they are in an area where they don't seem to hurt the image quality while watching movies playing games or working with a number of Office applications. I wish it had at least one USB 3.0 port but it does have three USB ports one with the live charge so when the laptop is off it will still quick charge an MP3 player or other device that can be charged via USB. I wish the hard drive was a little larger but I can live with it. The sound is a little on the quiet side but when using headphones you can hear plenty after all it was designed more for work than play. One strange note, for some reason Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit version is telling me that there is 3.87 GB of memory instead of the full 4 GB's that are actually installed.  All in all it is a great buy in this price range. Amazon is the only place selling this particular model.", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very disappointing sound quality through external speakers", "Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "R273FOQCQJFIRY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered this laptop to replace my old one which died on me and while it is nice for the price, there is one major flaw, well for me anyways. The sound quality through external speakers is very poor compared to my old laptop. Being that the two main activities I use my computer for are surfing the web and listening to music, this is pretty disappointing for me. I know it's not the speakers themselves that are the problem, because I've tried 2 different sets of speakers and I've also plugged my iPod into the speakers to compare sound and the iPod sounded better on both sets of speakers compared to the laptop. A lot of sounds in my music will get drowned out and hard to hear through speakers. I've tried fiddling with the sound settings offered to try and get a better configuration but nothing really seems to work well. This is really the only problem I have with it, although it's a big letdown for me. If you want good sound quality out of your laptop I would look elsewhere. Although through headphones it sounds pretty good for some reason, but I don't like to use my headphones when I'm at home and I have an iPod for that anyways.", "Date": "September 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "powerful and inexpensive.", "Author": "Charles Rocamboli", "ReviewID": "R3QA6RHVBM9LXT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very fast and has great graphics. battery last for about 4 hours with a big screen.

So far it's been a wonderful laptop for it's price. Under $500 is amazing for what's included for its performance and what I need it for. For a minor stress test of the processor and video card included, I installed The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion and it works just fine. Now I know Oblivion is a 5 year old game by now, but it still has techinal issues that are good for stress testing and so far this laptop runs it with no problem.The cons are pretty simple and slight: Battery life is a bit lower than other laptops, but usually one would plug this into an outlet anyway. No click handle to hold the lid down. If you are careful with this, then there won't be a problem. The speakers are quiet and not that great. Once again, it's a laptop, if you want to do heavy gaming or video watching, you should use a desktop anyway. Wear headphones and there won't be an issue really. The hardrive space is only 320GBs. Yes, that is low, but I bought this for school mostly and a little recreation. The Hardrive space is plenty fir what I need it for.This is a great buy from here and I'm glad I caught it when I was taking advantage with my student Amazon Prime benefits.
