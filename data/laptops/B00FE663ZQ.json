As soon as I got it, I ran Furmark on it, just to check whether all the benchmarks on the AMD A10 processor were right. Well for me it did well enough. Good processor speed and good graphics. A plus is the rich sound, which is better than from my older HP. I also wanted to upgrade the memory to 16GB and the harddrive to SSD, but the computer runs so smooth that I will wait until it struggles someday.The laptop is delivered with the Leap Motion apparatus. Haven't used it yet.You will have to install your own Office programs and the codecs for Windows media player for .flac files. So basically you're getting a windows8 delivered with some HP apps. Really nice looking laptop, about 2 kilos estimate in weight and I enjoy it. I also recommend this to others who want to buy.Just in case there is a newer model of the AMD A10 processor (This one is the 5750) opt for that one, because it will give you more space to tweak.Cheers,Aniel20th January 2014 update:Upgraded with Crucial Ballistix 16GB (2x8GB) 1866MHZ memory and Crucial M500 480GB SSD.I have a very fast computer now.When changing the harddrive, I cloned with EaseusTodo software and first boot after swiping hard drives went fine. Then after 15 minutes started hanging.I then just installed a fresh copy of the exact windows8 (downloaded from a torrent) and all is fine now. Don't worry about the key, it's pre-programmed in the Bios. Be sure to have your original copy registered, because windows will ask you to log in and once it finds your data, everything will further be applied (also the key)according to your previous settings.My Laptop works like a charm. Couldn't be happier. Cheers.ps. Don't underestimate the A10 5750 processor. It's quite good.", "Date": "December 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice laptop", "Author": "Amber Massey", "ReviewID": "R1SW6G8XPHCFJ5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "very nice, sleek - no dvd, but that cuts down on weight, ordered an external dvd device to keep in the office", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Expectations", "Author": "K.

It's sleek. The keyboard is comfortable and quiet. The touchpad uses hand swipes that are helpful, although some (the right-to-left swipe, namely) are rather annoying. The number pad is a must for me, and it doesn't skimp on keys - there are dedicated \"home\" and \"end\" keys, which is a nice addition. The finger swipe unlock for the keyboard works very well. I thought it was an extraneous feature, but lo and behold, I use it every time I open my laptop.SOFTWAREI'd like to think I'm tech savvy. My dad was a computer engineer. I would sit on his knee while he taught me to use Windows when I was just five. Until Windows 8, not much had boggled my mind - not even working on a Mac. Windows 8 is a complete departure. The learning curve is somewhat steep, but the old desktop is there for comfort, if need be. But since I believe Windows is sticking to their guns with 8 (unlike Vista), I'm forcing myself to go along with it and learn the damn thing. Responsiveness is good, Speed of download is good. The app store obviously needs to be developed, but we all know they're pouring money into it. There are certain apps - like Facebook - that are just easier to visit as websites. You end up finding your flow with Windows 8, it just takes some time and A LOT of patience.BATTERY LIFEThe battery lasts about four hours, which is rather short. I use my laptop at home and for business trips, and these days outlets abound, so I'm not concerned. But it may be a concern for you.NOTE: this laptop does not have a touchscreen, and it doesn't need it.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "Aubrey", "ReviewID": "RTY94M0TA3IZ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This computer is fast, sleek and affordable.  I hate Windows 8.  I wish Microsoft would do more customer research and figure out that Vista is a superior product, but HP doesn't have anything to do with Microsoft's decisions.

Although it is my first computer with Windows 8 instead of Windows 7. For the most part I've gotten the hang of redesigning the starting apps, and finding my way around the computer. It's pretty decent.Only thing about it is, It does not have a CD/Disk drive. You can always buy an external one if you absolutely want one. So that is no biggy, I am buying my computer some accessories to make it easier for my self, Cooling pad, wireless mouse, etc.I've had no problem with this computer so far.

I keep trying to figure out why it costs $200-$300 more and keep coming up with nothing other than the fact that they want it to look like a great deal.Sooo keep a look out and see if the price drops after Black Friday!

This model is rated 3.5 GHz,though I have not tested to validate.  All works well- nice tactile yet quiet keyboard, has numeric keypad, Touch Screen ishandy.  I downloaded an emulator for the old Win 7 start Menu and desktop look & feel and menu to ease my transition to the Apps AND 8.x interface, thus I can avoid the learning curve on new OS as long as I want.

I hated giving up XP Pro when I had to get Win 7.x as it was the only very stableWin OS since Win 3.11 .... 8.x looks good thus far. as did Win 7.x...NOTE:  This machine comes with NO DVD read or write.  You must have an external or another computer....Full Disclosure, I did not have to buy this computer. Why?  Because HP offered me a free replacement computerbecause of a replacement  Intel Wireless card that did not work, then 3 weeks of back ordering of Intel Wireless card.After being ripped by many US Manufacturers, like GM, etc.  this was a very nice experience!Conctrast: My experience with Lexus, the \"perfect\" car manufacturer?  My brand new GS 400 (2000 model) gaveme engine trouble for six (6) months.  When I traded the car for another brand, Lexus Customer service askedme how I felt about the Lexus GS.  I told them it was probably one-half notch above the extinct Yugo (oneof the world's worst cars.)  The lady offered me a \"free Lexus golf shirt.\"  I asked here why I would becomea walking billboard for a crummy car (based on my experience.  Get ready for this... She then offered mesome Lexus golf balls... I also declined that silly offer because a $60K car ($85K +++ in 2013 dollars.....)Lexus is not, nor it ever be on my shopping list... I quit GM after a WORSE experience years earlier.
