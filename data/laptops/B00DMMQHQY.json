Honestly, everything about this laptop would make you think it's a laptop priced over $1000 (I got it for $750 off Rakuten which used to be buy.com), except for the screen resolution.  My mom also bought a laptop recently from Dell for $350 and it has the exact same screen resolution - now tell me there isn't something wrong with that.  But otherwise, it's a powerful mid-range laptop that will probably last me for a while.", "Date": "August 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "\"Gaming Specs\" Laptop at a Good Price", "Author": "Angel", "ReviewID": "R1LXE4QH5LVSCQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a laptop with \"gaming\" specs, because they're powerful and can handle most computing tasks and of course gaming if I want.

Fast, capable and fairly light.  As always, touch pads are not so user friendly, but an external wireless mouse more than compensates for this.  Great buy!", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "A great deal!", "Author": "christian", "ReviewID": "R3MBZRD08PBDAO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Excelent laptop with a really good processing power, which along with a GT740M, makes it perfect for daily use as a multimedia center and gaming. Great quality for a modest price. As for my particular experience, I'm a gamer and love playing on it. Games like Metro 2033, Crysis 2 ME, Battlefield 3 and Dead Space 3 run smoothly at 30 to 40fps on high graphics settings, though you may need to use 720p resolutions. Its PhysX processing ain't good either, so you'll have to disable it to be able to play. Another letdown is its battery life which makes it kind of stuck on a desktop to be plugged in. Games may eat it's power from full to 10% in an hour and a half, two if you are lucky. Its cooling system is excelente making it perfect for long gaming sessions eithout overheating. As for hardware, the keyboard it's good with full numeric keypad and light for latenight use. Powerfull speakers with nice low bass and a pretty average screen. Boot times are really short and with Win 8.1, it doesn't take more than 15 seconds to turn on and be ready to use, even less if it's just sleeping. Overall a great laptop for daily family use and for latenight gamers that don't mind lowering visual quality on their games to have a good experience.", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great laptop", "Author": "Garet Hofer", "ReviewID": "R37NGAH81RHD7E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Honestly at first I wasn't even considering Toshiba. But after looking at this laptop it has the specs i wanted at the price I wanted. So i decided to take the plunge with Beach Camera. I can say i'm glad i did so. The GPU in this laptop makes it nice to play wow at FPS as high as 60-70 in busy cities and a consistent 50+ in raiding environments.If wow isn't your style, I have tested it with multiple different games. In FFXIV, the framerate was absolutely playable. I had no issues with lag what so ever in FFXIV. I had to adjust the graphics settings and put them on normal laptop quality. I've tried this laptop with Day-z Standalone as well. I had some trouble with Day-Z even loading. I would be in the game and it would  often lag out on me. Had to adjust the graphics settings accordingly. Honestly, It is a great buy considering what you get with it. You have to be careful during use though. The laptop will often try and default to the Intel card resulting in poor performance graphic wise. A simple change to default GPU in nvidia settings fixed this.", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent relation price-value", "Author": "Amilcar Edgardo Aleman Melo \"mikeg\"", "ReviewID": "R33KWNK1D6NY12", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fast Core i7 Procesor, MidRange Nvidia Graphics Card, Big Hard Drive anda good quality brand with no excesive bloatware", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome but...", "Author": "Jeffalex2", "ReviewID": "R2AG41W5ANP512", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a very powerful, reliable machine.
