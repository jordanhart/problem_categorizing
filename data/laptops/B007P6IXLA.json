All that remains is how long it will last. I am happy.

Be warned about items \"fulfilled by Amazon.\" Customer service is terrible because Amazon provides the customer service, but doesn't own the shelves so the best they can do is offer you a refund. The refuse to acknowledge that this is basically a bait and switch, and send you the correct product. Furthermore, they refuse to change the language on their product listing to reflect the actual product. I would give zero stars if i could for not-as-advertised and really painful customer service.That said, this laptop is great, good enough despite all this to garner two stars. Just look to purchase it from elsewhere!", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$799.99", "Features": "DISPLAY | 13.3 in diagonal HD BrightView LED-backlit (1366 x 768)\nPROCESSOR | Intel Core i5-2467M 1.60 GHz with Turbo Boost Technology up to 2.30 GHz\nMEMORY | 4 GB DDR3 1333 MHz\nShow your appreciation for the movie The Hunger Games with this special-edition HP Folio 13 ultrabook.
