Contrast and color balance are just behind the rest, even against other entry level laptops.- You're probably better off with the cheaper and better-speced Acer V5-561-9410.", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "great laptop", "Author": "barbovacs", "ReviewID": "R1YDDXPIAXZTRS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using lenovo laptops at work for years (and IBM prior to that).  I have gotten very comfortable with the little red joystick, and also the location of the select buttons on the trackpad. So when I needed to get a laptop of my own, those were features that lead me to pick Lenovo ThinkPad.  I also appreciate the glare resistant screen.  I was pleased to see that I could get this computer, but sad it was not available locally and a bit apprehensive about ordering it online without first seeing it.  There are some slight differences in the selection keys, but that is Ok since the location is the same.  I am pleased with the computer and the availability of Windows 7 with upgrade discs for w8 provided, the i5 processor and 8G and DVD provided.  And the computer arrived within 2 days of placing the order...perfect for my needs. At 1 week, I am a satisfied customer.", "Date": "April 22, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00J9ITPJQ"}}
