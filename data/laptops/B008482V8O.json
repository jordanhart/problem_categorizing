However the real test comes with time, how will it hold up?", "Date": "October 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "I'm happy with my new Toshiba", "Author": "Glory Ann Kurtz", "ReviewID": "R2HHZML0V65OKP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Toshiba computer I ordered through Amazon was as advertised and I received it right on schedule.

Kaufman", "ReviewID": "R10OODC76O53GS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Perfect for the price I paid, but to say it's perfect in general would unfortunately be a lie.I'll start with the positives. The laptop is still running with virtually no damage aside from HDD issue that I'll get to later. I bought it last year in August for school, so it's impressive to see no real issue from then to now. The computer is still fast, has a brilliantly fast start up time, has not blue screened once, and only overheated one time when I accidentally was laying on my side with the computer tilted and blocked the vents. (stupid mistake but it turned back on quickly enough)The battery is a little on the weak side, only lasting an hour on high, and ~3-4 hours on eco mode. This is after a year, however, so I'm perfectly fine with these stats as I normally have access to an outlet and the charger is pretty small if you coil the cords around the box.The screen is still perfect with virtually no pixel issues. There's not even a random red dot on the screen which after all my gaming I'm glad to see.A few screws have fallen out, and I can tell the case is a little loose because of it, but I don't run while I use it so I really have no issue. It hasn't fallen apart and it doesn't feel like it's ever going to.Touchpad is fine for a casual user, and it gets the job done for me, but any gaming requires a mouse.The RAM is a GREAT features of this, truly a plus in my eyes. 6gb of RAM is plenty for a much more expensive computer, yet I got this one on sale for 550, so to say I'm content is an understatement. The CPU could be better but this is on a gaming point of view. It runs smoothly, quietly, and in a cool fashion on virtually anything else. I can rest the thing on my lap without it getting hot (though this wasn't the case with the old HDD)That leads me to that issue. The HDD failed out after 9 months of use. I noticed issues with the laptop getting very warm, and basic games from the 90's being a little sluggish. I took it to my uncle who examined it and said the HDD was probably going to fail the next day. He tried to transfer my data out of it but most of it was lost due to failure (But I maintained my music thankfully)A week later the laptop has a nice SSD. I would have liked to have used the HDD as an external source for all my movies and music, but you never know when an HDD will fail. Could last 10 years, or 10 minutes.I enjoyed the 750 gb of room it had, but my SSD is truly better. With it, I almost never have to use the fan to cool down the system in the winter, and turning my fan on and pointing it where I'm sitting is enough in the Summer unless I'm doing something extensive like a game or Microsoft Visual.That leads me to the GPU which is below average for games as it's integrated and intel. But it runs everything perfectly fine outside of games. It can even run Skyrim on low (most likely due to the rest of the computer being much better in comparison and having 6 gigs of RAM to leech off of) so I don't have to go without games entirely. It even runs Minecraft on Normal Draw Distance, which isn't exactly an easy feat. For the budget gamer, this definitely is a valid choice.To say I'm satisfied with the $500 computer is an understatement. It has lasted a year without any parts except the HDD failing. Even so, Hard drives can be sketchy even in high end laptops and I doubt many will have similar scenarios. The SSD I got was only 180 so all in all I spent 700 on a laptop that does everything I want it to, starts up fast, can do everything I need in school, and can even game a little. I really love the Satellite line of laptops, and if you have to buy Toshiba, I'd recommend this laptop.It isn't perfect, but compared to other $500 laptops it's top tier.", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wow", "Author": "GARY MORRIS", "ReviewID": "R3NJ5AJV49EJV5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This computer was awesome!If I hadn 't forgot about a sniper bid I had in for another computer on Ebay, I would have kept this computer. There's is a real good chance that I will be buying another one at some point in the future.It was unbelievably fast. I have never seen web sites load so fast. All this time I thought it was my internet provider, turns out it was my outdated computer.If you can get one of these used or refurbished, I highly recommend you do so.This computer seemed to be at least twice as fast as the computer I ended up with (I7 core). I think that is mainly because the one I have now has Windows 8 and this computer (the one I am reviewing) has Windows 7.It doesn't come with all kinds of extra programs to bog your computer down before you even get it. It's not loaded with all kinds of advertisements and trialware programs that you have to buy in 30 days or uninstall.What an excellent deal and an excellent computer.", "Date": "March 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointed with the TOSHIBA Web Camera Application", "Author": "Charlie2444", "ReviewID": "R2PAFNL1TSKMIB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I upgraded to the Toshiba Satellite L855-S5240 from a HP Pavilion dv7-1264nr Entertainment Notebook PC to get Windows 7 with the option to upgrade to 8 for little cost.
