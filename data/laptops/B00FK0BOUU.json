{"Reviews": [{"Title": "slow and charging issues", "Author": "whatever", "ReviewID": "R20TDNEBLECKCK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this so that my wife could have a new laptop she could also use when doing educational software with the grandkids.  A key feature for that latter purpose was being able to use a relative large touchscreen rather than a mouse, and the size of the touchscreen has worked out well.  The FLIP part is not terribly easy to execute, but being able to position the screen in that fashion is also nice for grandkid touchscreen use (or video viewing, I suppose) once you get it flipped.  In many respects it is a fine machine (the numeric keypad is a nice feature), but the main problem is that it is very SLOW.  When a two-year old touches a virtual button on the screen, s/he does not want to wait five or ten seconds for something to happen.  I realize that using that AMD processor is part of making it an inexpensive unit (which is also a plus in this case), but Lenovo gave up too much in the way of speed with this model.  My other complaint has to do with the battery charging system.  If you leave it plugged in you get a message that battery is overcharging, and then when you leave it unplugged you have to deal with low battery issues before long.  They need a better battery management system so everything works if you just leave it plugged in all the time as we routinely have done with laptops when we are at home.  With a bit more speed and a better battery system, it would easily move to four stars and maybe to five.", "Date": "April 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Crashed after 7 days of use", "Author": "Southern Gal 2014 \"I have sworn thee fair, th...", "ReviewID": "R2ZQVME1F7EH3O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Update **** 3/31/2014***This computer just crashed after being bought 7 days ago! Prior to that, my mom had a few issues with it (it was taking FOREVER to start up), but we figured those issues would decrease with time. Well, now I'm returning it!Old review:I bought this computer for my mom after her Acer died. I have to admit, I was a bit ambivalent about buying a $500+ online (though I've done it before LOL) and researched this computer extensively before buying it so I wouldn't get burned.The computer came in while I was at work. I thought it was strange my mom hadn't called me, since I was out late that night, but when I got home I found out why. She was busy playing with her computer, checking out all of the apps with a large smile on her face. I asked if she liked, she rolled her eyes and said \"what does it look like?\"This computer is SERIOUS! My mom actually thought it may be a little too much for her, since all she does it check e-mails, read gossip websites and create spreadsheets (yeah, LOL). But I was able to convince that it was perfect for her, that should she ever need the extra space on the computer (which their is plenty of) it will be there! This computer is large (I'm used to computers the size of the Mac Air), but it is the perfect size for her. Considering it's size it's actually pretty light (all things considered) and Windows 8 works GLORIOUSLY on this computer! I recently bought a computer with Windows 8 and it works well, but not as well as this one! The touch screen works better than the trackpad (not to say that the track pad doesn't work, because it does). I was a little iffy about the convertible feature of this computer, but it's built to where the keys aren't damaged when you flip it to tablet mode.I am VERY impressed with this computer! I currently have Acer something (can't even remember the name LOL). I'll be getting another Mac Air ASAP (I LOVED my old one, but the screen cracked and I refused to pay more to repair the screen than I buying the dang computer). I HIGHLY recommend this computer!", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Gift that went over with a bang!", "Author": "PrettyInPink \"PIP!\"", "ReviewID": "R3BSOG8AYU6LHF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this for my mom for Valentines Day.
