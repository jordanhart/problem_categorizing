I knew I didn't want to spend that amount again on another computer, but I also knew I wanted a better processor than I had in my XPS. I had heard about the Intel processor i3 and the raves about it, but I hadn't heard of the Intel i5 processor.  While doing my diligent research for an economical laptop with a faster processor, I came across Data Sales Co.Data Sales Co. had this Dell Laptop Latitude E6410 advertised for less than $200 with an Intel i5 processor!!.  Initially, I was a little skeptical on the price and why it was advertised so low for being used. I did more research and found out that the Intel i5 processor was better than the Intel i3 processor, but the Intel i5 processor wasn't as good as the Intel i7 processors which are mainly used for gaming laptops.  However, I couldn't find an Intel i7 processor laptop for $200.In all my researching, I gleaned a jewel of a machine plus found a great company (Data Sales Co.) that I will continue to recommend to others and do business with again in the future!!.  When I received this Laptop, It had Windows 7 installed in it which is a lot easier to navigate than Windows 8. Other than a different operating system and the size of the hard drive, everything else was the same as my Dell XPS.  Oh yes! and of course the price! Big difference between $2000 and less than $200. It was because of the other little differences that I noticed the HUGE difference in the speed of this phenomenal Intel i5 processor.! It is lightning fast!! My Dell XPS Intel single core processor was so slow and sluggish compared to this processor! This Intel i5 processor can definitely keep up with the huge amount of multitasking that i do!I highly recommend this Dell Laptop Latitude E6410 and Data Sales Co. for their outstanding professionalism, dedication to their customers and quality of work!!", "Date": "February 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "I'm Lov'in This Machine!", "Author": "drfugawe", "ReviewID": "R1VOHG47MLBU0J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I learned a few things about getting a refurb computer with this purchase (from Tampa Laptops) - got burned on my last refurb (purchased direct from Asus) which had a faulty motherboard and of course took a year to find out - did they know? Of course they knew. This time I took the time to find a highly rated refurber of top quality units, and then be willing to pay a little extra to cover the necessary added expense - and I'm very glad I did!This unit came with 4gb ram instead of the listed 2 - that's not a complaint! That means I only need to upgrade the hd to make this a full machine. Less than a year ago, I bought another Dell refurb laptop - but while the unit has been fine, it came with Win 8, which I hated so much that I gave the machine to my wife, and I got this one primarily for the Win 7 Pro - what an absolute joy!Just a note about Tampa Laptops' service - my unit arrived with a battery that wouldn't charge properly (hey, these computers are coming off 3 year leases, and batteries just don't last that long - I called Cory from Tampa Laptops, and he immediately turned me on to a seller of new batteries for good prices, and credited me back half the cost a new one)  I think that's very fair.I've owned many Dells, and they all have lived long healthy lives - when I need another, I'll be checking back in with Cory at Tampa Laptops!", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Glad I purchased Refurbished", "Author": "Baranduin Brewster", "ReviewID": "R3HBGL3GQGU10C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this laptop (through Data Sales Co.) to replace my Dell Inspiron i3, which had a difficult time (kept freezing/lagging) running Home Building/Landscaping and video editing programs. I was a little reluctant to purchase this laptop due to the price being under $200, but I'm glade I decide to give it a try (saved myself between $400-$500 by going through here vs the Dell Refurbished Sales). One the reasons I went with the Latitude was that I need an easily customizable laptop since I'm in a IT class. One of the first things I did was drop 6 GB of RAM in, took me about 1.5 minutes to do (just remove 2 screws in the back and the back slides off). Next month I plan on adding a solid state hard drive.Laptop came as described except mine had 3 GB of RAM instead of 2 GB and a 250 GB HDD instead of 160 GB. It was pleasant to open the laptop (Window 7 Pro) and not have to remove a bunch of junk applications that is bundled into to Home Editions of Windows 7. Even with only 3 GB of RAM it was a speedy laptop, quite capable of running multiple high end programs at the same time. The battery life is phenomenal at 6+ hours, I took the computer to Drill and didn't even need a charge the whole day (other laptops required at least one charge).", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Exceeded Expectations, Negligible Quirks (Mac users please look elsewhere!)", "Author": "BGA", "ReviewID": "R17R0M131O8A6B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Item arrived in less than a week, flawless packaging and all inclusive as advertised, the machine was clean as a whistle, slightly loose right hand side hinge, otherwise holding up fine, clean win7 and subsequent drivers install, not a scratch on the monitor, satisfied customer here. I found out that there is a common problem with a verity of win7 laptops across various brands that when you close the lid it goes to sleep mode and doesn't want to wake up. Force restarting it causes the OS to crash obviously and possibility of loss of data etc. I am rather tech savvy and over the course of several months studied the issue online and tried just about every trick there is to no avail. I settled to just leaving it running, when powered, and shutting it down for extended breaks. Painful indeed. What clearly prevented me to throw the laptop out of the window is the solid built (it can do serious damage to someone/ something J) and relatively robust computing experience from such an inexpensive machine. Which is intended since I do have access to high end laptops from work and wanted a decent laptop to privately use it all up and not to worry about losing or abusing it.
