{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great lightweight Ultrabook for daily use", "Author": "Marlene Adelle", "ReviewID": "R1XW2YO73IP04F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Ultrabook has spoiled me forever.  Full size power and performance in a lightweight product that I use daily. My 2-year old Toshiba Satellite laptop feels like it weighs a ton compared to this one.  Battery length is excellent (almost 6 hours unless watching videos, maybe 4 1/2 - 5 hours) and sound quality is much better than expected although I usually use headphones, it's nice to have a laptop that you can hear clearly through its own speakers.  I flow between using the keyboard, the mouse, and the touchscreen (which I love), but the onscreen keyboard has not gotten as much use from me as I thought it might.  Windows 8 took no time to get used to for me and is very compatible with this touchscreen Ultrabook. If you miss having a backlit keyboard, as I've read in other reviews of this model, just tip the screen down for a second to see what you're doing.  I know where the keys are, so for me the lack of backlighting was a non-issue.  Cosmetically, it's absolutely beautiful and fingerprint free (except for the easy to clean touchscreen).  I got this exact model for $600 at Best Buy after a very good sale and some other discounts (I bought a Verizon JetPack mobile hotspot and got another $100 off the price of this computer, which was just an added bonus at the checkout counter that I wasn't expecting). This was about three months ago and I haven't seen it on sale for such a low price since then.  This model may be steeply priced if it's selling for $900 but if you can find it for $750 or less, grab it!", "Date": "July 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "It is an excellent laptop", "Author": "Leonid Quoshek \"Leonid1\"", "ReviewID": "R1XPXYFB9F3P0Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is an excellent laptop.  Very light.  I bought two of them this black Friday and migrated on Saturday from my old (2010) laptop without any problem.  With its SSD buffer drive this laptop is flying.

Battery is pretty good too. And it starts up really fast from sleep.

The battery charge is good, the keyboard is a great fit, and the screen resolution is great. It's a little heavier than I expected given the size, but not so heavy that it affected my satisfaction with the product. My ONLY beef with this has nothing to do with the Samsung product, its with Windows 8, which I hate so much. I use this for school and browsing and watch some video. the fan is very quiet, which i love, and this hasnt heated up much on me yet. It boots up pretty fast, faster than other machines I've used.", "Date": "June 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "A true lemon", "Author": "CHR", "ReviewID": "RZ4PFMEH44CR5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We purchased the Samsung Ultrabook because of its good ratings, but we have had nothing but problems with this computer.  We have owned it for one year and three days.  In that time, it has been in twice for repairs.  The power button, motherboard, hard drive, dc cable, palm rest and AC adaptor have all been replaced.  Today, we had the dreaded blue screen.  Samsung will not stand behind a product that is three days out of warranty.  This is now a $700 paperweight.", "Date": "May 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love this laptop", "Author": "Dieselfumes \"Aviator\"", "ReviewID": "R1S3MM90OWMYMA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros-------Feels solid and not too heavybuilt wellScreen responsiveness is very good (for new users of Win 8 and 8.1 (free upgrade) it may seem the screen is too sensitive but once you get the hang of touch screen interface you will love it.for the price i paid it was an extreme value for money as a borderline ultrabook and reliability of samsung ( own a S4 and galaxy note tablet 10.1) all of them perform flawlessly.Perfect size 13.3 inchesPortable with all necessary ports availableCons-------no backlit keyboard (for me it wasn't a big deal as i don't care much for backlit keyboards)only improvement i would suggest it to get the weight even more down by a pound atleast and to include a backlit keyboard (to grab more customers as i believe many people like that feature)", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Returned the next day", "Author": "robert", "ReviewID": "RXZCQX2DH2PPZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered this computer, and while I was told it had a backlit keyboard by the seller...it did not, so I received a refund. I just want everyone to have a clear answer on that, it does NOT have a backlit keyboard. Also I was extremely disappointed in the screen quality. I ended up with an asus for $800, and when you put the two screens next to each other, It is a joke that Samsung calls this an HD screen. Very dull and pixelated. I would recommend Asus UX302 at bestbuy. While I had a disappointing experience, the seller was very understanding.", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Didn't like", "Author": "Vladimir Nemirovsky", "ReviewID": "R1ZQ3AKYFF1TAJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It was incredibly slow and either had some defects or viruses. I never figure out which. After running Norton scans and running anti malware products for few days I gave up. Contacted the seller. To my surprise, they were very helpful and accepted the return without any issues. Even paid for the shipping.
