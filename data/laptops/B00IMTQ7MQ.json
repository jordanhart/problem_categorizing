Need I say more?Ok, it did get occasionally choppy, but the graphics performance is incredible. I also use this for work and it's equally as fast doing massive Java compiles while running Oracle and Weblogic servers. It runs much cooler in normal use than my old Asus G71GX, mostly because it uses the on-cpu Intel graphics for apps that don't need the GTX-880M. Even when it's running full out, it's still quieter. I'm not into all the silly program-your-own-color stuff for the keyboard, but it can be turned off. If that floats your boat, you can do amazing configuration of keyboard keys, colors, etc.The only issue I've had is with the Killer wireless, as many people across many machines have had. Solution: go to your network properties for the adapter, turn off the Killer anti-peformance junk in the protocol stack. Boom, full-speed 11n wireless.", "Date": "June 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best value 880M laptop you can buy...", "Author": "Ryan Huff", "ReviewID": "R2V29PE4VKBPKS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best GPU out, Blu-Ray drive, great screen and sound, plus the back lit keyboard is pretty sweet. I was also surprised to see that this had the 4810MQ in it, not the 4800MQ as listed.The only negative with this laptop is RAM and hard drive.  The combo of 8 gig and 4 gig sticks does not make any sense.  Why couldn't MSI just put in two 8's for dual channel baffles me?  The hard drive is fine for storage and programs.  I don't buy into the mSATA hype...I just installed a Samsung EVO SSD in the second bay as my main OS drive and partitioned the 1TB disk drive.In response to the other reviewer, only the $4,000 laptop has all the accessories not all Dominator Pros.", "Date": "May 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not the same as the other Dominator Pro models.", "Author": "Robert Morgan", "ReviewID": "R3OANWDOHGSYF8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Does not coming with any of the \"Pro\" edition accessories (mouse, backpack, etc.).Does not support mSata.

Just have to pull the drive out of the enclosure.  That gives me a total of 3 TB storage.  I will probably be replacing the original drive with an SSD.Original hard drive is broken into 2 partitions.  Just go into drive manager, delete partition for drive D: and then expand drive C: to fill empty space.  Takes 2 seconds.One strange thing was BIOS did not recognize any drive in the 2nd slot.  I even moved the original drive into 2nd slot to test.  Booting into Windows did show the drive in the Drive Manager and everything works fine.  I was freaking out for a while and almost called customer support.  Have not tested BIOS or booting off 2nd drive since getting it working in Windows.Comes with a 8 GB stick and 4 GB stick, both under keyboard.  See YouTube disassembly videos to get to them.  I replaced them with 2 Vengeance sticks, 8 GB each (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H33JU3K/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc;=1).I get around 8900 with 3DMark 11.Does not come with Windows disk, everything is pre-installed.  Home version, not Pro version.  Does come with drivers disk.Knocking points off because I really expected this to be the full \"Pro\" version and it's not.  Pro is supposed to come with SteelSeries accessories and the mSatax3 support.  At least it has the 880M video card.", "Date": "May 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "XoticPC has poor customer service", "Author": "Lesley", "ReviewID": "R3JQJ8L4QQOU68", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I just purchased the GT70 Dominator. It arrived, and I had it out of the box for a few mere hours, when I got the system failure screen TWICE. I called XoticPC, and not only did they not help resolve my issue, but they refused to exchange the computer since it had been shipped more than 15 days prior (I live overseas and use a military APO/DPO address). The service guy had no idea what to do to troubleshoot the problem. Later the same night, I got a third system failure message. In the end, one problem I discovered was that they installed a Windows XP driver for the webcam. I still don't know what caused the system failure messages. In the end, I reinstalled the operating system, and all seems to have worked out. But, buyers beware that XoticPC has really poor customer service.

Windows 8.1 took some getting used to. However, this thing has eaten every game I throw at it for lunch. It maxes out settings on 99% of games, and many of those at 60+ FPS. And it also has little bloatware. MSI includes some handy utilities to monitor your temperatures and performance as well. I am satisfied and this is a very good desktop replacement/gaming laptop purchase.", "Date": "May 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Super gaming laptop. Has some bad hiccups but I solved it. Overall - Excellent.", "Author": "Justin Chia", "ReviewID": "R37U2SAR87JHWK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "CON:I afraid I have to AGREE with Lesley. The item that I received has a bad OS. It was good yesterday (for a while) but now it is a hell. I CANNOT activate Windows of 9600 build. I don't have an administrative right even though I am listed as an administrator. I CANNOT run any of the Windows store app including PC SETTING (or through the desktop control-> system ->activate) thus I CANNOT activate. Windows freezes a lot. I don't have any opportunity to test any hardware capabilities through any games of my own because of the errors or lack of administrator access. I am still hoping my hardware is good. I am trying with Active Boot to take over the OS through USB. However, UEFI wouldn't let me boot to any USB devices. My Linux OSes are not working either. I CANNOT run GeForce experience software either. Return with error. I will try to wipe this junk off with my own old Windows 8.0 that I haven't use before. If this doesn't work all I have is a big piece of junk. If it does work, than my rating will go high on the roof.PRO:On the good side shipping is fast, two days shipping and free! You cannot beat that. Nice hardware specifications and it is better than the older model. Once I put in new (old Windows 8.0 Pro bought from PX) I will test it again. Such a pretty hardware specs cannot be left untouched.This beast has the hardware as described. I cannot test them right now until I put my own Windows 8.0 Pro.Updates:  After sometime, I found out it could be just my HDD problem. I put it my 250gb Samsung Evo and it is working fine (and extremely fast). Fortunately, I am still able to migrate the software from the HDD to my SSD using Samsung Data Migration utility (comes with the SSD). I able to test Crysis 2 in ultra modes, AF, AA and Directx 11 (texture packs, not the lousy Direct 9 version). Graphics is flawless without any hiccup and fast loading, however I am not able to get the actual FPS number yet. I will run on other benchmark software to make sure there is no other hardware errors.  If it is good, I might not have to build another ITX computer.", "Date": "May 13, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,899.99", "Features": "Intel Core i7-4800MQ (2.7 GHz, 6 MB Cache)\n12 GB DDR3L SDRAM\n1 TB 7200 rpm Hard Drive\n17.3-Inch Screen, NVIDIA Geforce GTX880M with 8GB GDDR5 VRAM\nWindows 8.1", "Name": "MSI Computer Corp.
