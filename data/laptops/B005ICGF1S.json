I have a desktop as well. I have noticed its gotten slower but probably from my own use. I use this daily and it's almost always on. 75% of the time plugged in. I can still unplug it and get 2 1/2-3 hours of use on battery saver mode (always been this way). It can handle a lot at once but it's not a high end gaming laptop. I can play Sims 3, with no mods, on moderate settings. It plays older games flawlessly though and runs photoshop very well. The only thing I hate is the keyboard. Junk gets under the keys and its hard to clean, which is why I gave it 4 stars. I'm a busy mom to a toddler and three hairy cats so it doesn't take long for stuff to gunk up my keys. Overall I'm happy with my choice to get it. I'm writing this review from it now =]", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "This laptop is sure to get the job done.", "Author": "B. crafton \"Polk Audio Man\"", "ReviewID": "RDSOJY2VW1A0W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop has made it through 2 years of college for me, which is not a light task I am known for abusing electronics. I have left this laptop in direct sunlight for long periods of time, Plus in frigid cold winters of Michigan it survived. Its been thrown around in my book bag etc... but through all of these demands it remains in tact and fast as ever. The screen has true HD graphics with a remarkable refresh rate for a personal computer. I strongly recommend this laptop, as it has proven to me that Acer is a future brand name for PC'S.", "Date": "May 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Christmas present for our son", "Author": "DHarper", "ReviewID": "R342JW98DHPCR9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this laptop for my teenage son to get some work done and just to have a laptop of his own. Its works great and is perfect for the basic work, email, and web surfing. I would not recommend this laptop for any type of gaming as its not really built for that; however we we're looking for a gaming laptop. Just something our son could get some work done and surf the web. Great buy and a great value. I would recommend this to anyone.", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent lap top.", "Author": "Manuel Rodriguez", "ReviewID": "R1R42SFTY1XSW8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "IT IS AN EXCELLENT LAP TOP.

DICKSON", "ReviewID": "R8RVQXXE3H6C2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Using it right now to post this review. I've had it for about 2 weeks. It's quick, the screen is huge and it functions perfectly. No complaints and it was shipped promptly. Thanks!Update: After using it for a while, it's still holding up great. It is frustrating to use it at times because if you're a multitasker like myself, the laptop gets really bogged down. Really only recommend this laptop for light users. Won't run videos or programs like Photoshop well at all. Will upgrade the ram to 8gb to see if that remedies the issue.", "Date": "August 27, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Product: Acer Black 15.6\" AS5733Z-4851 Laptop\nProduct Number: AS5733Z-4851\nBrand: Acer\nOperating System: Windows 7 Home Premium\nProcessor: Intel Pentium Dual Core P6100 processor 2.0GHz, 3MB L3 Cache", "Name": "Acer AS5733Z-4851 15.6\" Notebook (Dual-Core, 4GB DDR3, 500GB HD, 6-cell, Win7)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Hk47D9-2L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005ICGF1S"}}
