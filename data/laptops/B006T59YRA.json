I threw around a few ideas on different models and brands, just researching before I came to a definite conclusion.I am happy with this purchase, but the page listing the information on this particular model is incorrect. Under 'graphics processor' it is said to have a GeForce GT 540M chip. Which would be a phenominal graphics chip for such a cheap notebook. That is why I had bought this model. ... But after doing some research around the web, everywhere else stated this particular model came with the Intel HD 3000 chip. Surprise, surprise. That's what it came with. (I was hopeful!)It's not a big deal, either way. I am satisfied with the notebook. It did come used and I did have to uninstall a lot of factory bloatware and such. I also had to remove around 14 viruses. Which I don't mind at all doing. I think it's fun!All in all... happy with the purchase. Just be weary when buying used notebooks. I lucked here as there is/was nothing seriously wrong. Hardly scratched up at all; runs like news. Blah blah blah.Plus, ASUS has always been a good brand to me!", "Date": "July 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "A solid product", "Author": "Elaine C.

Construction feels sturdy, layout is clean and attractive, multi-gesture touchpad works well, keys feel positive when typing, having a number pad is helpful since I'm a bookkeeper,.screen is bright, speakers have good volume. Bought this one because it has Windows 7, not Windows 8.Only wish: more USB ports; it only has two.My last desktop was an Asus and lasted me almost 10 years; that encouraged me to choose this brand.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Keyboard is problematic", "Author": "Economics9698", "ReviewID": "RJE31QCBNAZB2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The keyboard and speakers are not the best.
