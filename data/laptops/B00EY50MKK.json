Always have, always will. Mainly due to the bang-for-buck experience. Don't fret because it's only a quad core, the APU (not CPU) in these is designed differently than a CPU and work pretty damn good for games! I typically run two screens, but due to ports on the back, I can run 3 w/ ease!Pro's~First off, for a $500 laptop (give or take, depending where you purchase it), this is an EXCELLENT buy for gaming or other!~Plays EVE/WOW with ease, graphics on high! Checking FPS it's showing between 52-62 FPS, even under stress while having the game going (downloads in back ground, multi boxing, etc) the lowest I saw with graphics on high was maybe 28 FPS.~Battery last slightly longer than advertised (I stripped all the Acer Software off, and other preloaded software).~Screen contrast & color is bright and vibrant for this laptop.~Doesn't take up much space, very thin, but don't be fooled. It has great cooling properties (I'd still recommend a laptop cooler).~HDD is a SATA 3, 5400rpm 6Gb/s driveCon's~Built in Battery.~No Optical Drive (CD Rom).Summary~BUY IT!", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best bang for your buck", "Author": "Robert", "ReviewID": "R3SMGQL0TSD4BP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this at staples for 479.99 (it was 579.99 here at the time of purchase). this thing runs like a charm, I run all applications with minimal lag.Pros:1. I can run the latest games on low or medium, sometimes even high (like bioshock infinite).2. Even though it is AMD and set to 35 watt, the laptop only gets warm when doing intensive tasks, so it stays nice and cool3. Extremely light weight to carry.4. A really responsive touch pad and keyboard, rarely have I had issues with this.5. The screen is really nice and colorful, surprising for the price and res.6. Part of this is made from aluminum.7. Web cam is really good for a laptop.8. The battery life is not bad, not as good as some of the intel haswell laptops, but I get a nice 5-6 hours with mixed usage with the brightness at 35-45 percent.9. the speakers, it is really loud and clear, especially with the dolby home theater v4. While people complain about them being on the bottom, this is a good thing when on a desk. It will use the desk as an amplifier.10. heat dispersion: the fan ports are on the bottom and in the back, I don't know about you, but this makes me happy, no longer does heat blow on my sides. it blows in the back so i don't feel the heatCons:1. Non-removeable battery, while I don't mind this on phones, with laptops I do. When gaming on it, i like to remove the battery to help keep the longevity of the battery.2. The screen housing is very filmsy and flexes very easily if pushed in the middle, so close only from the corners or edges.3. Glossy screen, Hate this, prefer matte. Glossy shows finger prints and always needing to be cleaned.4. Audio port: They combined the headphone and microphone into a single 4 pin port. so while earbuds with mics will work (besides anything designed for apple), all headsets and gaming headsets that have the 2 ends, (pink/green) you will need an adapter, and they are only 6 bucks.5. BLOATWARE: like all laptops, this thing is loaded with bloatware. Thought besides 4 programs, everything is mostly removeable. only a few acer bloatware are required, and they don't hinder anything, it's mostly a hassle removing the ones that do.6. cheap: Because it is a cheap laptop, that means something was short cutted to reduce cost, Haven't run into an issue yet. mostly paranoia.7. Hard drive: a problem all non-ssd laptops face. crap 5400 rpm hard drives, which causes start up and loading programs to become extremely slow.You're own viewThese are things I find neither bad or good, but I feel should be pointed out and you can decide.1. Video ports: while it does not have a VGA port, it does come with an HDMI and mini display, which you can buy an adapter to convert the Mini display into a vga or even DVI.2: ports continued: The usb ports are all over the place. both sides, and in the back. which is also where the HDMI, mini display, and power port are located.3. touch pad: While very well constructed, the buttons are located under the pad, not 2 distinctive buttons like on some. I find it looks more sleek, but it is hit or miss for some.4. full keyboard. This comes with a full keyboard with a 10 digit keypad, Some like this, some don't.5. some of the function abilities are oddly placed (like clicking fn + f4) to do something, but it didn't stop the flow, just found it unusual.6. Windows 8/8.1: I love windows 8, I will admit there is a learning curve that MS did not really help people through, but once you get the hang of it, windows 7 just appears to perform slower. I do have my complaints about 8, but I still prefer it, not all do.7. power button: it is located on the side, others complain this might cause accidental power shut offs, I haven't come into that problem.8. Screen res; 1366x768. I think this res is just fine on a screen this size, some feel they need 1080p. I don't, but still might sway buyers.9. Acer: I have had many issues with acer in the past in terms of quality control, while have known others to love their stuff. I decided to buy this because I love the AMD APUs and it was a very friendly price tag. So far the build quality is unlike anything i've seen from acer or laptops in this price range.All in all, I would recommend this laptop to anyone. It won't do hard core video rendering, but for business tasks, gamers who like to be on the go a bit more, perfect for college students.5/5any questions, feel free to comment.", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Solid laptop", "Author": "Guy Nelson", "ReviewID": "R2KPPVG6078F6C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Solid laptop with good battery life. It isn't going go be mistaken for an ultrabook, but for the price it has been excellent. My only complaint is the amount of bloatware that it shipped with, but that stuff is removable and without it I'm sure the price of the laptop would have been higher.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great looking notebook with decent performance.", "Author": "Kyle Ast", "ReviewID": "R14W5OZ52SF4IU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "These 500 dollar laptops are great. They can power the latest applications, and even do a pretty good job at gaming as long as you aren't obsessed with FPS. Keep in mind though, some of these chipsets and architectures can be over a year or two old. Be sure to check a notebooks processor with a quick web search of its exact name and model.Pros:The thing looks amazing in brushed aluminum, and the keyboard looks great as one solid piece with the island keys inlaid.Built in bluetooth 4.0Power button on the side. (For me it is a pro, some people claim it's too easy to accidentally shutdown)Most ports at rear, for anyone using this on a desk, or in an endtertainment center, it's nice knowing you can stand the laptop vertically if need be, and still have acsess to the primary ports.Windows 8 installed (c'mon, it's been long enough haters)\"Classy\" touchpad, it's hard to even tell it IS a touchpad it looks so good.If you didn't know any better, you would think this was some kind of bastard child of the MacBook come back in time to save John Conner.Cons:It's missing stuff...things I have come to rely on in my laptops.No optical drive whatsoever.No VGA connection, this is my back up to HDMI when I travel.No Audio Input/mic jack. Sure there's usb sound devices, but that's precious space.To compensate for this lack of peripherals, Acer has included the \"Acer Converter port\"Don't bother searching the web, the port is barely acknowledged because its just a Mini-DisplayPort (to my knowledge).The SD card reader has a plastic faux card insert that just reminds you of old ass computers.There doesn't seem to be a button to shut off the touchpad, like on most laptops. I never use that button, but I don't like change.Bottom line: if you want to play games from the year 2001 to the better part of this year, this would be a good buy. It stays cool in a bag, or in an entertainment center. It emulates most retro and \"neo\" retro games (like the PS2' GC, etc) with ease, and renders/encodes/multitasks like a champ. My reason for four stars is simple. Acer Converter port. Its a waste, and a lie.", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Internals, Poor Design, Decent Price.", "Author": "Gareth Olson", "ReviewID": "R2N5FE2DNG04OI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought this laptop to use at school.  I needed something that would be sturdy/rugged, powerful, and portable at the same time.  I saw aluminum on a PC under $800.00 and jumped on that deal.  The aluminum construction, ultra-thin design, and macbook-esque keyboard all promised to impress, however, I was severely disappointed by the build quality.The good:This laptop looked really sharp.  It's a very handsome, clean looking design.  Aesthetically it's great.The laptop has great sound.  It has four speakers and can really belt out some tunes.The laptop has excellent internals.  It has a solid video card, plenty of ram, and a quad-core processor for way less than these features normally go for.The Bad:The thin design without the proper reinforced materials means everything feels extremely flimsy.  The hinge is waggly, there's a lot of flex to the screen half of the laptop.  For what's marketed as almost an ultra book, it has almost no portability.  Being lugged around in the padded laptop section of my SwissGear bag that I bought designed specially for it, the flex has caused the screen to rub against the spacebar, putting a large scratch in the middle of my screen.Only a very, very small portion of the laptop is aluminum.  There's a lot of plastic on this and it shows.  My laptop's paint has started peeling under the screen already.The keyboard feels cheap and clunky.  The keys take more force than feels necessary in order to register them, and the touchpad is unresponsive and vague.  (trying to left click is kind of annoying)Only 3 usb ports, only one of which is 3.0Overall I'm forced to question what exactly the manufacturer thinks we should be doing with this laptop.  In this day and age, it doesn't have nearly enough ports to become a desktop replacement and it isn't rigid enough to be a portable laptop even with a specialty bag.  If it was tougher, I would understand trying to slim it down to 5.6\" by removing a bunch of ports and a usb drive, but in all honesty, with such weak build quality, I wouldn't trust this in a backpack, book bag or anything else by itself.The laptop is probably the cheapest I've seen that can run a game like skyrim with full graphics, so I would recommend this laptop to gamers who are on a really tight budget and need a decent gaming laptop at a great price.I would not recommend this to students because students need to be able to move their laptops around a lot without having to worry about peeling paint or the spacebar ruining the screen.The laptop gets a Five for its internals and speakers and loses two stars for a lack of ports and a lack of portability/durability.

It feels incredibly sturdy as well.The graphics on this thing, are amazing. Quick enough to dive into huge spreadsheets during the day, and it has no problem playing most Steam games.

It set up fast worked well, aside from windows 8 but it's bad no matter the system I think, and I was enjoying it. However the same day I bought it it decided to shut off and not turn back on. This happened after maybe 5-7 hours of constant use and maybe 2 setting up before i restarted it. I'm assuming it overheated but it wasn't all warm and there was no indication at all the fan was going much more than a constant low speed.  I'm assuming I just got a faulty one but at the same time it was far to close to getting it for me to want to keep it. If it had happened a few months later I would have gotten it looked at an fixed but I didn't want to start a new laptop off on that foot so I returned it the day after I got it. It may have started working that day too but it left to bitter a taste in my mouth.In all it is a good laptop. It runs well, feels good, keyboard is awesome and the track pad isn't to bad. If it hadn't broken on me I have no doubt I would have used it for a good 2-3 years minimum.", "Date": "May 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Horrible design", "Author": "VirginiaGurl", "ReviewID": "R2GCVE1KS2BOAL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I wish a zero rating was possible. I am completely dissatisfied with this purchase. I purchased this model twice in the last 1.5 years for my 18 year old daughter. She is very responsible and always takes care of her electronics. This PC has failed her twice. The hinges on the first one broke after 8 months and left her with a cracked screen which will cost upwards of $300 to replace. The hinges on the second machine broke and cracked the screen after just 5 months. I called Acer to inquire about the warranty and I was told that they only cover hardware and software, not physical damage due to a design flaw in their product. I know it's a design flaw because the hinges and casing broke in the same place on both machines. My daughter did not break the machine. I foolishly blamed my daughter for the first machine cracking, but I now know that it was not her fault. She fell in love with the laptop due to the backlit keyboard and touchscreen features, but she's had her heart broken by Acer both times. I will never purchase an Acer again. I don't need disposable laptops with poor designs. I agree that the 4 and 5 star ratings must have been paid for. We needed a laptop that will not disappoint, so I got her a Mac today.", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Don't read or trust the other reviews; they must have been paid writers", "Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "R2OH7YXWIQVRPM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop for 2 reasons.#1.) To be able to play League of Legends whilst sitting on the couch.#2.) To take it with me on vacation to off load pictures from my  camera, and to be able to watch netflix/hulu at night.I removed a lot of the bloatware, I also removed the stock AMD Graphics drivers and replaced them with current drivers BUT... This POS laptop cannot achieve more than 35 fps on any graphical setting in LoL. I played top teemo 3 games, changed video settings, changed drivers and I still could not do better than 35 fps.I read the reviews and people claimed a lot of stuff that this product is just unable to do. If this laptop cannot run LoL achieving at least 55-60 fps solid than i highly doubt it will getting better than 30 fps in other more demanding games.My 9 year old gaming computer that has horrible specs compared to this laptop can run LoL @ 60 fps without a problem. So ya I am totally bummed that I wasted the money on this.Basically this laptop is designed for facebook losers, and college students.I'm sure this laptop will be fine doing normal tablet / smart phone things, but when it is time to actually preform like a PC this thing is just lacking in every way. It is extremely slow, has lag issues multi tasking, load times suck, windows 8 is stupid. I hate this laptop in every way.Do yourself a favor and pass on this laptop unless you're not expecting too much out of it. I thought that I was expecting just the basics, but I guess I must be asking too much..
