It will barely connect to the internet and then moves so slowly it is ridiculous.  I know it is the laptop, because I have another one that sails along, as well as my phone and my tablet.  But this one is a darn parking lot.  It is the only laptop with Windows 8 so it could be either the Windows 8 or the laptop; but to me, it doesn't matter which.  I would not recommend this product", "Date": "February 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "GREAT product", "Author": "mspete1", "ReviewID": "R2M3AFJPOF3LXF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great laptop and I use it every day.  It is easy to learn and use and can do everything I need including email, internet, graphics and word processing.  It is fast and does not seem to have the glitches I have run into with other computers. You will love it!", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$909.99", "Features": "3rd Gen Intel\u00ae Core i5-3317U processor (3MB cache and up to 2.6GHz processor speed with Turbo Boost) /  6GB DDR3 memory (expandable to 16GB) / 750GB Serial ATA hard drive (5400 rpm)\n14\" LED-backlit TFT-LCD high-definition widescreen touch-screen display (1366x768 (HD), 16:9 aspect ratio, Supports 720p content) / Intel\u00ae Wireless Display / Mobile Intel\u00ae HD graphics (64-1696MB shared video memory) / Built-in HD webcam with microphone\nMultiformat DVD\u00b1RW/CD-RW drive with double-layer support / Multiformat media reader / 1-USB (3.0) port, 2-USB (3.0) ports with Sleep and Charge / 6-cell lithium-ion battery\nBuilt-in high-speed wireless LAN (802.11b/g/n) / Built-in 10/100 Ethernet LAN / HDMI Port /     Headphone jack (stereo), Microphone jack (mono), SRS Premium Sound HD, harman/kardon\u00ae stereo speakers / Weighs 4.3 lbs. and measures just 1.1\" thin\nMicrosoft Windows 8 64-bit operating system / ENERGY STAR qualified / Etched aluminum body in prestige silver", "Name": "Toshiba - Satellite 14\" Touch-Screen Laptop - 6GB Memory - 750GB Hard Drive - Champagne Silver", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41WTM5Ob2PL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00A7DIV4M"}}
